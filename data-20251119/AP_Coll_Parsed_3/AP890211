savings and loan customers withdrew a record 
81 billion from their accounts in december evidence economists 
say that the industry is being squeezed by higher interest rates 
the federal home loan bank board which regulates 2955 federally 
insured savings and loans said friday that december marked the 
eighth consecutive month of net withdrawals reversing the tide of 
deposits that poured into sampls following the 1987 stock market crash 
meanwhile in other developments 
federal deposit insurance corp chairman l william seidman in 
an interview confirmed published reports that the federal reserve 
board put together a contingency plan last weekend in the event that 
the announcement of president bushs proposal for the savings and 
loan crisis triggered depositor runs 
the fdic said it has taken control of six more savings 
institutions bringing to 10 the number of sampls brought under the 
agencys jurisdiction since bush gave it that responsibility on 
monday 
the december withdrawals topping the onemonth record of 70 
billion set in november occurred at a time of mounting publicity 
about sampl problems regulators closed or merged 75 institutions that 
month 
but bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria 
va attributed the development to interest rate movements rather 
than to nervousness by sampl customers 
he said customers are turning to money market mutual funds and 
other investments because sampls are resisting pushing up interest 
rates as fast however he predicted sampl deposit rates likely would 
be forced higher as the federal reserve board tightens credit in an 
effort to dampen inflation 
boy thats hard on the bottom line he said this does not 
bode well for thrift earnings 
indeed one member of the federal reserve board martha seger 
dissented from a policymaking boards decision in december to push 
interest rates higher on the grounds that could aggravate sampls 
problems 
her opposition to higher rates was revealed in minutes released 
friday of the dec 1314 meeting of the federal open market 
committee 
however economist martin regalia of the national council of 
savings institutions said the presidents effort this week appears 
to have bolstered confidence in savings institutions 
if you look at the stock market they look at this whole 
process as being a net plus he said thrift stocks have risen 
in the last few days because i guess they feel the problem is being 
addressed 
james barth chief economist of the bank board attributed a 
large share of the december deposit flow to a single healthy 
institution which shrank its deposit base by 34 billion as part of 
a deliberate strategy of substituting lower cost borrowing he also 
noted that money normally flows out of savings accounts in december 
as people spend to celebrate the holidays 
seidman in an interview friday said administration officials 
who he declined to name were predicting depositor runs when bush 
announced his sampl plan and that the president insisted the federal 
reserve have an emergency plan in place 
i was on the other side of the argument but i was just as 
eager as anybody to have a plan in place in case i happened to be 
wrong he said 
the fdic which insures bank deposits will take control of more 
than 200 insolvent sampls in the next four to six weeks under a 
cooperation agreement with the agency insuring thrift deposits the 
federal savings and loan insurance corp 
the six institutions taken over friday by the fdic are first 
federal of arkansas and savers federal savings and loan association 
both of little rock ark sandia federal savings and loan 
association albuquerque nm bright banc dallas university 
savings association houston and deseret federal savings and loan 
association salt lake city

hoping he has put questions about his private bank 
holdings behind him secretary of state james a baker iii set out 
today on a weeklong trip to the capitals of the 14 us allies in 
western europe likely to be dominated by defense and trade issues 
for baker whose foreign policy experience is slight the trip 
beginning in iceland and winding up next friday in france is a 
learning experience and a warmup for a probable nato summit meeting 
in the spring 
it is a listening trip and it is a consulting trip baker 
said friday at a news conference here but i am carrying a 
message we want to make it clear the way to approach the eastwest 
relationship is with prudence and with realism we want you to know 
we are not dragging our feet seeking delay for the sake of delay 
baker said he would solicit the views of the allied governments 
on how to negotiate strategic nuclear weapons reductions with the 
soviet union and what to do about modernizing nato s battlefield 
weapons 
baker hopes meanwhile he has put to rest a potentially ticklish 
problem over his holdings in chemical new york corp by saying he 
would tend to be guided by whatever conclusions are reached by 
government ethics lawyers 
the holding company has 45 billion in loans to third world 
nations and baker as secretary of state will be called on to play a 
leading role in addressing the economic problems of developing 
countries 
baker said he would ask for a presidential waiver allowing him to 
participate in such decisions but baker said he would also consider 
other options such as selling his stock or changing the terms of 
the blind trust in which all his holdings have been placed in order 
to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest 
i have concluded i should seek a waiver because that gives me 
additional protection and helps avoid any appearance of 
impropriety baker said in ottawa where he stopped with president 
bush for five hours of talks with canadian leaders 
baker said c boyden gray bushs top adviser on ethics and 
other government lawyers were trying to find a mechanism or 
actions that would be taken in my case to insulate me from charges 
or appearances of a conflict of interest 
baker said he had not talked to gray and that the presidents 
ethics adviser had not asked him to sell the bank stock but baker 
said gray had raised selling as an option in talking to robert 
kimmit a washington lawyer who was named under secretary of state 
for political affairs 
i have been very careful about recusing myself from specific 
issues that might constitute a conflict of an appearance of 
conflict baker said referring to his jobs as white house chief 
of staff and then treasury secretary in the reagan administration 
however he said government attorneys also told him he could 
participate in general policy determinations without violating 
ethical standards 
bush and baker are in the midst of a review of us foreign 
policy negotiations with the soviets to reduce longrange missiles 
are on hold and the administration also faces a decision on whether 
to ease restrictions on technology sales to the soviets 
at the same time baker will try on the trip to promote increased 
defense spending by the allies even while the bush administration 
tries to keep its own outlays in check 
baker who began his nato discussions friday night with foreign 
minister joe clark of canada is also under pressure from the allies 
to ease restrictions on trade with the soviets 
automatic curbs on technology that could have a military use were 
imposed by the carter administration to punish the soviets for the 
1979 invasion of afghanistan the soviet troops are leaving with 
the last soldier due out by next wednesday 
baker said he had not made up his mind despite reports that he 
had decided to lift the automatic curbs but he stressed that if the 
curbs are eased this does not mean we are opening the doors to 
technology transfers

with two years remaining in world war ii dmitri 
shostakovich composed his harrowing eighth symphony a reflection on 
the destruction of war 
sir georg solti brought all the flash he is know for to the 
hourlong piece friday night as he led the chicago symphony 
orchestra at carnegie hall 
sir georg surely has never met a cresecendo he didnt like which 
suits this shostakovich perfectly as the strings and the woodwinds 
fade in the desolation of the scores final pages the previous 
thunder of brass and percussion has left the audience yearning for 
peacefulness 
in this work there was an attempt to express the emotional 
experience of the people shostakovich wrote to reflect the 
terrible tragedy of war 
to convey that experience shostakovich uses all the orchestral 
artillery he can muster after 15 minutes of buildup begun darkly 
by the cellos and basses the percussion lets loose like a marching 
band sounding the drumbeat of the war that surrounded shostakovich 
and what orchestra better to capture that sound than the 
chicagoans more than any other orchestra it has managed to 
maintain a distinctive sound in the age of planehopping music 
directors its tone is bold and brash powered by perhaps the best 
brass section in the world 
sir georg celebrating his 20th season as music director and his 
75th birthday still leaps about the podium with the energy of a 
teenager whipping his troops to let loose even when the score 
briefly turns towards peasant dance music at the beginning of the 
fifth and final movement sir georg reaches for the big sound 
earlier with a muchreduced orchestra sir georg led a warm 
rendition of schuberts fifth symphony schubert wrote it during a 
monthlong stretch in 1816 when he was 19 and although it does not 
come close to the quality of his eighth and ninth symphonies it has 
an almost mozartian softness 
the chicagoans had a chance to show off their violins especially 
during the three allegros sir georg in contrast to his 
falstaff four years ago let the sisboombah rest in a piece 
that didnt need it

a blocked heater pipe spread deadly fumes through 
a house killing four young men and leaving a woman in critical 
condition authorities said friday 
the deadly fumes might be either gas or carbon monoxide but 
were leaning toward carbon monoxide fire department spokesman 
scott la greca said 
it appears that they have been dead for some time in terms of 
hours or days i dont know la greca said somehow the woman 
was able to survive 
a flue pipe inside the living room heater and a separate pipe 
connecting the heater to an outside wall were blocked causing the 
fumes to seep into the room said peoples gas co spokesman ed joyce 
the four men were pronounced dead on arrival at holy cross 
hospital said supervisor joyce kopecky she identified two of the 
victims as brothers joel blazek 17 and kenneth blazek 21

critical condition at university of chicago hospital did not live 
at the house but were neighbors the fourth victim a 36yearold 
man was not immediately identified 
four people were found in the living room and one person in a 
bedroom authorities said 
carbon monoxide is a colorless odorless extremely poisonous 
gas because it has no odor or color persons breathing it usually 
fall asleep without realizing they are being poisoned it results 
when fuels containing carbon like coal or oil burn in stoves or 
furnaces that contain insufficient oxygen 
la greca said authorities determined there was no need to 
evacuate nearby buildings after gas company workers shut off the

his wife they fell off the illfated challenger space shuttle 
that police say was just one prop in hunts pose as an 
astronaut during a period of makebelieve that carried him through 
several states speaking engagements and marriages 
now his wife is leaving him and he faces fraud and larceny 
charges for taking his makebelieve too far 
state police arrested hunt on jan 28 in suburban medford the 
27yearold plumbers son from everett is accused of swindling his 
fourth wife and bride of five months ann sweeney of up to 50000 
on her companyissued credit card without her knowledge and for 
taking 4000 from a saugus family on the promise he could get their 
18yearold son out of the navy 
on jan 6 calling himself marine capt robert j hunt the fake 
astronaut spoke before a group called the experimental aircraft 
association 
he was a very good speaker he entertained us he held us 
spellbound for 2 hours said greater boston chapter president 
lou pascucci 
sweeney 23 a former optical engineer also believed he was an 
astronaut 
i love the person i thought i was married to she said 
recalling the day he was unmasked sweeney said i was shocked 
it was almost like watching someone die he just dissolved 
disappeared 
hunt is being held on 100000 bail in a boston jail his case in 
east boston district court was continued to feb 15 after a request 
for reduced bail was denied hunts attorney james cipoletta could 
not be reached friday but he has said he urged his client not to 
speak to the news media 
investigators compiling the story of hunts alleged stories say 
that for the past eight years he has been fooling many people in 
imaginative ways in massachusetts florida pennsylvania and 
ireland 
montour pa township police chief robert lighow said hunt 
allegedly rode around pennsylvania in a limousine seeking models for 
his baby powder while pretending to be a powder maker he said 
friday that he was investigating charges that hunt swindled his 
third wife a local woman out of large amounts of money he would 
not elaborate authorities say hunt is believed to have been married 
to two other women 
harry doan the owner of an air service in daytona beach fla 
was convinced by hunt that he was a navy helicopter pilot 
last summer hunt chartered a jet to fly with his wife to 
montreal allegedly charging it on his wifes credit card while 
telling her the flight cost nothing because he was a space shuttle 
pilot

shilling but politely said nothing others were completely taken 
in 
during hunts arrest police searched the apartment and found 
assorted military paraphernalia flight jumpsuits and a helmet 
bearing the insignia of the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
dr park dietz a forensic psychiatrist who is an fbi consultant 
and a professor at the university of virginia said there are cases 
in legal circles falling under the category of the socalled 
imposter phenomenon 
its generally believed that people who are able to dupe others 
into believing that they have some professional status thats 
untrue most likely suffer from antisocial personality disorder 
said dietz who is on sabbatical in newport beach calif 
he said a recent national institute of mental health survey found 
about 5 percent of adult urba men and nearly 1 percent of adult 
urban women suffer from the disorder 
dietz said the ailment can be hereditary and that people who 
practice such deceptions tend not to have the same depth of 
emotions of empathy and warmth despite their charm 
why are so many duped 
it takes energy thought mental work to be skeptical about the 
myriad claims to legitimacy we come upon every day he said 
its easier to take people at their word particularly when it 
conveys some status by associating with them

president bushs proposed tax breaks for oil 
drillers are winning an expected round of applause from the oil 
industry but officials and analysts disagree over whether the 
measures will stem the decline in us oil production 
i dont think were going to get that much more oil out of the 
united states even if these tax incentives were passed said ed 
rothschild assistant director of the citizenlabor energy 
coalition an advocacy group that favors greater use of renewable 
energy sources as an alternative to fossil fuels 
its more of a political gesture to the industry than a plan 
for revitalizing domestic oil production rothschild said in an 
interview friday 
industry officials said the proposed tax incentives worth at 
least 350 million a year would if enacted result in a measurable 
gain in oil and gas production 
this is a very healthy step forward said jim groninger 
washington director of governmental affairs for the independent 
petroleum association of america tax incentives are an important 
component of a national energy policy 
the tax breaks unveiled by bush in his budget address thursday to 
congress were coupled with a postponement of lease sales for oil 
drilling off the california and florida coasts areas the oil 
companies consider prime drilling prospects 
bush said he was seeking to balance environmental needs with a 
desire to revitalize the depressed oil and gas industry which he 
called vital to us national security 
the american petroleum institute representing the nations major 
oil companies welcomed the bush tax incentives but said more steps 
would be needed including opening up more federal lands and 
offshore areas to oil exploration 
the tax incentives are a step in the right direction but 
they alone cannot stem the serious decline in domestic petroleum 
production said charles j dibona president of the petroleum 
institute 
us oil production has fallen by more than 1 million barrels a 
day over the past three years and last december the oil production 
rate was the lowest in nearly a quarter of a century at the same 
time oil demand has increased in recent years leading to a 
reliance on imports that bush says poses security risks 
bush rejected the idea of imposing a tariff on imported oil but 
proposed four tax incentives aimed at boosting exploratory drilling 
particularly by smaller operators the tax breaks would be phased 
out if the price of oil currently about 17 a barrel rose above 
21 
the tax package includes 
a 10 percent credit on the first 10 million of spending per 
company per year on intangible drilling costs those not directly 
associated with drilling a well such as hauling equipment 
a 10 percent credit for spending on all new tertiary enhanced 
recovery projects those that use steam carbon dioxide or chemical 
injectants to increase the production rate from oil and natural gas 
fields 
allow drillers to exclude a major part of their income from the 
alternative minimum tax 
change oil and natural gas depletion rules that the 
administration says discourage the transfer of marginal wells from 
major oil companies to independent producers and result in the 
premature abandonment of producing wells 
the administration said the tax package was aimed mainly at the 
smaller producers which traditionally have drilled the majority of 
new wells in the united states

the aroma of old leather mingled with the 
smell of new money at the nations largest book fair where you 
could pick up a 1632 edition of shakespeare or the philosophy of 
andy warhol bound with 5 bills 
i love to lose myself in other mens minds wrote charles 
lamb in an essay on books and reading and he would have been 
blissfully transported at the california international antiquarian 
book fair which opened friday 
organizers hoped a record 8000 people would browse through the 
centuries of writers and bookbinders art not to mention buy 
but the 188 booksellers from throughout the united states and 
seven other countries anticipated winning new devotees as well as 
making profits 
book fairs cultivate book collectors they come here and see 
things theyve never seen before said george robert kane a 
bookseller and chairman of this years fair 
they love literature or see the beauty of the illustrations 
they get into it and pretty soon theyre hooked said kane 
whose necktie was printed with rows of books 
in most cases its a consuming disease a consuming passion 
thats better 
future collectors might catch the bug while admiring a second 
folio edition of shakespeares plays offered for 60000 a 
painstakingly illuminated 15th century flemmish manuscript book of 
hours for 35000 or a 1482 venetian volume of euclid priced at 
25000 
the most expensive item is a threevolume set of the first 
edition of moby dick published in england in 1851 and entitled the 
whale its price a quick 75000 but its in firstclass 
condition and a goldembossed whale adorns the spine of each volume 
collectors on a tighter budget could choose an autographed copy 
of oscar wildes an ideal husband bound in goldstamped blue 
morocco leather and costing 4950 
even some 20th century authors command a handsome price a first 
edition of ian flemings casino royale for example is offered 
for 1250 
despite fears that television and videos have produced a nation 
of people who dont read dealers said growing numbers of people are 
becoming fascinated by and buying rare books 
business is better that its ever been said jerry weinstein 
manager of heritage book shop inc in los angeles 
some collectors think of their purchases as investments that will 
increase in value with the years but even collectors with an eye 
toward possible resale buy the old and rare volumnes primarily out 
of love 
the preponderance of them are buying not for investment but for 
just having it as something beautiful just like having a picasso 
weinstein said 
having something rare and beautiful doesnt have to cost 
thousands of dollars prices at the fair start at about 20 and 
some first editions of wellknown authors such as john steinbeck and 
f scott fitzgerald can be had for about 100 
if you fall in love with an illustrator or an author from 
elior wylie to shakespeare youll search for the things you can 
afford said kane who gave up newspaper work to become a book 
dealer in santa cruz 18 years ago 
a part of the admission proceeds from the fair which continues 
through sunday goes to the san francisco public library

an air force study concludes that deploying 
huge mx nuclear missiles on railroad cars would neither interfere 
with the operation of the nations rail network nor harm the 
environment significantly 
the final environmental impact statement released friday at the 
pentagon turned up some problems at a few of the 11 air force bases 
that are being considered as candidates for rail garrisons 
but the statement insists that while there is a very slight 
potential for accidents with the deployment of the mx rail 
garrison system the system would be safe and would pose negligible 
risk to human health and the environment 
former president reagan ordered the development of a railbasing 
plan for the 10warhead mx a weapon he dubbed the peacekeeper in 
december 1986 his goal was to overcome congressional concerns about 
the vulnerability of the missiles inside underground silos 
president bush is now facing a march 15 congressional deadline to 
decide if hell back reagans plan if he does and congress agrees 
the air force plans to build 25 sixcar trains with each carrying 
two mx missiles each garrison could house up to four trains 
because of the small number of trains involved the conclusion 
friday that the system would not interfere with commercial 
operations had been expected the air force also went out of its way 
to note that training operations for crews would be conducted with 
fake trains that wouldnt carry real mx missiles 
in the event of a derailment or other accident the chances of an 
explosion or fire involving the missiles propellants are 
unlikely and for the nuclear warheads virtually impossible the 
report says 
us nuclear weapons include safety features and control over 
arming mechanisms that assure there is virtually no possibility of 
an inadvertent nuclear detonation the report states 
the rail car launchers would remain inside fortified military 
bases unless there was a threat of war and only then would scramble 
on the commercial rail network to avoid a soviet firststrike 
attack the air force said 
the heaviest environmental impact would stem from construction 
activities at any bases selected to serve as garrisons for the mx 
cars the air force said those would consist primarily of increased 
traffic congestion the shortterm degradation of air quality and in 
a few instances the relocation of inhabited buildings 
of the 11 air force bases reviewed however four would likely 
suffer significant degradation of biological resources if rail 
garrisons were built the air force reported 
those four are barksdale air force base la fairchild air force 
base wash whiteman air force base mo and wurtsmith air force 
base mich 
despite those findings the impact statement offers no ranking of 
the 11 bases nor does it disqualify any base from consideration 
it repeats a decision made two years ago that fe warren air 
force base wyo will be the headquarters and first home for any mx 
trains but it noted that rail deployment has not been approved by 
congress and that it is premature to select other bases 
the other bases considered candidates are eaker air force base 
and little rock air force base in arkansas dyess air force base 
texas grand forks air force base and minot air force base in north 
dakota and malstrom air force base mont

a congressional study concludes that a 
foreigntrade zone program intended to encourage us exports 
instead is helping foreign auto parts manufacturers by giving 
millions of dollars in tariff breaks 
although originally created in order to encourage 
exportoriented trade in its current form the program provides 
greater benefits to firms who import more parts the general 
accounting office the investigative arm of congress said in a 
report issued friday 
the report was immediately praised by the automotive parts and 
accessories association 
the gaos findings underscore our industrys conviction that 
the program is broken and needs fixing said the trade 
associations president julian morris from its lanham md 
headquarters 
the report recommended that congress amend the 1934 foreigntrade 
zone law to provide guidance on what public benefits are needed to 
justify such zones or subzones factors to be considered would be 
exports imports employment and investment 
foreign trade zones were originally created to encourage the 
export of us goods that contain foreign parts the program 
however has become a major base for manufacturers serving 
domestic markets the report said 
the gao report requested in 1987 by rep dan rostenkowski 
dill and chairman of the house ways and means committee estimated 
the foreigntrade zones and their subzones in 1986 reduced tariffs 
on auto parts by 38 million 
the value of parts flowing through the subzones has risen 
explosively from 200 million in 1978 to 5 billion in 1986 the 
report said 
rep sander levin dmich a member of the house ways and means 
committee said the discrepancy between tariffs on parts and on 
finished vehicles created an obvious private benefit for 
automakers under the program 
imported auto parts are subject to tariffs ranging from 4 percent 
to 11 percent finished vehicles are assessed at a 25 percent 
tariff rate 
when vehicles built in foreigntrade zones are sold in the united 
states the imported parts are taxed at the lower 25 percent rate 
levin said 
automakers using the foreigntrade zone program run the spectrum 
from the michiganbased domestic giants general motors corp ford 
motor co and chrysler corp to foreign makers like nissan toyota 
and mazda that have established assembly plants in the united states 
most auto assembly plants in the united states come under the 
program the gao said 
although the foreign trade zone board which administers the 
program uses public benefit as its criterion for judging requests 
that standard has not been officially adopted and applications have 
seldom been denied the report said 
the report recommended the public benefit standard be made part 
of the law

bielskobiala poland ap lech walesa is a man gingerly 
dividing his time between two types of working clothes these days a 
blue suit for his talks with the government and a jacket and jeans 
for his union supporters 
he has been meeting with both this week a delicate balancing act 
aimed at winning concessions from the government and while keeping 
the support of the increasingly fractious solidarity independent 
labor movement 
since the monday opening of the talks known as the round table 
walesa has met with thousands of solidarity supporters in three 
cities to explain why he agreed to negotiate with the same 
government that banned their union 
the nobel peace prize winner visited warsaw on tuesday krakow on 
thursday and this industrial town on friday 
not since the heady days of solidaritys legal existence in 
198081 has walesa been able to so freely travel the country and 
openly meet with the union rankandfile 
more than 400 workers cheered when walesa strode into a hall in 
bielskobiala an industrial center for the first open meeting of 
the banned union here in seven years 
but they voiced worry about the outcome of the talks first 
proposed by the government during a wave of strikes in august 
polands worst labor unrest since the martial law crackdown of 
december 1981 
people have doubts they dont know what these talks are 
going to bring said miroslaw styczen a veteran solidarity 
activist in bielskobiala 
most people are really happy about the talks but theres not 
complete unity he said 
a textile town in the beskidy mountains 180 miles south of 
warsaw bielskobiala was one of the strongest solidarity regions 
during the unions 16month legal existence 
the solidarity leader launched into a speech he has consistently 
delivered all week he told the workers he didnt really trust the 
government but that poland badly needs agreement 
his listeners fired back questions 
how will you get people to join the new unions asked one 
young worker 
today everybody who wants to will soon be able to organize a 
group walesa replied 
how is solidarity going to be organized asked another worker 
walesa had no concrete answer but he assured them that 
authorities have made a political decision and that the union would 
exist again soon 
he pleaded for time and urged workers to be patient and not to 
strike 
we all have a moral right and arguments to strike give me 
a chance at the round table he said 
if it is too little we will fight he said 
earlier in the day walesa did don his dark blue suit for talks 
with cardinal franciszek macharski in krakow and a later meeting 
with faculty and students at the 14th century jagiellonian 
university 
walesa asked the students and professors to excuse him for any 
grammatical errors he might make saying he was just a worker 
about 2000 students crowded the halls near loudspeakers outside 
the small ornate room where walesa addressed about 200 invited 
guests 
one visitor was not allowed in a reporter from the communist 
party newspaper trybuna ludu 
believe in yourselves and build structures that can bring 
poland into europe and the world walesa told the audience 
students were dismayed that they had been given only 25 seats in 
the room and some seemed skeptical about the round table 
people are still trying to learn what the round table is about 
its too early to tell said piotr hertig a spokesman of the 
illegal independent students association 
walesas speech lacked concrete propositions people arent 
sure how to organize or what to do said another student 
as soon as there will be agreement we will be able to work 
walesa said he did not say how long he expected it would take 
the trip was grueling but walesa says he must make contact with 
people to grasp the situation to reacquaint himself with movement 
veterans and to meet the new generation of activists he plans 
another trip across poland next week 
traveling by car walesa appeared tired and impatient when he 
arrived in krakow late thursday 
more than 3000 people jammed the mistrzejowice church near the 
nowa huta steel mill to hear walesa speak 
lech welcome solidarity is not underground and was not 
destroyed said stefan jurczak of the solidarity region malopolska

nobel laureate elie wiesel and dozens of other 
world jewish leaders are coming to moscow to help open the first 
cultural center for soviet jews in more than 50 years 
while one of the leaders hailed sundays opening of the center as 
a sign of the improving fortunes of the countrys 18 million jews 
under president mikhail s gorbachev he said its too soon to 
declare an end to the problems of jews in the soviet union 
glasnost has taken hold here the question will be can it 
continue said rabbi marvin hier dean of the simon wiesenthal 
center in los angeles 
hier world jewish congress president edgar bronfman and wiesel 
a survivor of the holocaust and 1986 nobel peace prize winner 
are to speak at sundays opening of the solomon mikhoels cultural 
center about 70 jewish leaders from israel britain france 
australia canada the united states and other countries plan to 
attend 
the opening comes a few days after a soviet newspaper made a 
major admission that soviet jews have suffered discrimination for 
decades and that dictator josef stalin destroyed jewish culture in 
the country 
mikhoels a jewish actor for whom the center was named was among 
the thousands of jews who fell victim to stalins terror he was 
killed in 1948 in what was officially termed a traffic accident but 
what many jews believe was an assassination ordered by stalin 
the center is located in the moscow jewish musical theater on 
taganka square in the southeastern section of the capital 
its director mikhail gluz told the official news agency tass on 
friday that yiddish and hebrew classes are planned itself a major 
change the teaching of hebrew was once punished as a crime and 
several jewish activists were jailed for religious instruction 
soviet laws bar the private teaching of religious subjects to 
anyone under 18 but authorities have indicated a new law on 
religion being drafted will ease those and other restrictions 
hier said in an interview that soviet promises to allow the 
teaching of hebrew as well as membership by soviet jews in 
international jewish organizations have been couched in very 
diplomatic terms 
we have no commitment yet he said 
in a report previewing sundays opening tass said the 
perestroika or restructuring drive has altered the life of soviet 
society and prompted the development of jewish cultural 
associations 
but hier said plans for the center to have a public library 
jewish museum and art gallery could be ruined if soviet authorities 
interfere 
it is not the time to be euphoric but to make sure the center 
will be free to develop cultural and educational programs if that 
is what the center becomes it will be a great and epic event 
hier said 
if authorities step in he said we will be back where we 
started from 
the simon wiesenthal center has donated to the center an exhibit 
and russianlanguage books about the nazi campaign against the jews 
and has shown in moscow a film that accuses the soviet union of 
kidnapping raoul wallenberg a swedish diplomat who saved thousands 
of jews during world war ii and later disappeared 
as part of his effort to improve relations with the west 
gorbachev has taken several steps to address complaints that his 
country violates human rights 
for jews the changes have meant a rise in emigration 1988 
marked an eightyear high with about 20000 leaving less 
harassment at jewish holiday celebrations and the opening of a 
private jewish museum and library in moscow 
but mikhail chlenov a member of a private group called the 
jewish cultural association said the government has a long way to 
go 
jewish life in the ussr is in a state of crisis he wrote 
in a brochure on the mikhoels center official jewish cultural 
institutions such as magazines newspapers and theaters do not 
satisfy the demands of our time the growing jewish consciousness 
refuses to be compressed into an outlived framework

the democratic chairmen of the house and senate 
budget committees meet with white house budget officials next week 
to try to find out what they say president bushs 1990 budget 
neglected to reveal how the deficit will be trimmed 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif and his 
senate counterpart jim sasser dtenn said friday they would not 
proceed with the highlevel budget negotiations the bush 
administration wants until they get those details on deficit 
reduction 
before we go any further we want to sit down and find out 
specifically where theyre going program by program sasser said 
the lawmakers said bushs 116 trillion spending plan was vague 
when it came to specifying savings a strategy aimed at putting the 
pressure and the blame on congress for cuts that will inevitably 
be unpopular 
mr bush chose to give us only the good news panetta said of 
the presidents budget address thursday night to congress he has 
left it for congress to give the american people the bad news 
bush said his proposal would leave a deficit of 911 billion 
next year well within the 100 billion target required by the 
grammrudman deficit reduction law 
he achieves that level by holding the growth in the defense 
budget to the rate of inflation providing 309 billion in new 
spending making a controversial cut in the capital gains tax rate 
that he says will raise 48 billion in new revenues slowing the 
growth of medicare by 5 billion selling 37 billion in federal 
assets and extending taxes on telephone service and airline tickets 
that are due to expire 
but of most concern to democrats is bushs proposal to limit a 
collection of more than 1000 programs most of them domestic to 
the 136 billion spent for them this year democrats said this meant 
that bush was leaving the onus for finding 11 billion in cuts up to 
them reductions that could affect programs like toxic waste 
cleanups mass transit assistance and law enforcement 
this is not what we would call a flexible freeze panetta 
said referring to bushs campaign promise to reduce the deficit by 
limiting spending increases to the rate of inflation its a 
flexible squeeze 
sen pete domenici of new mexico the ranking republican on the 
senate budget committee defended bushs strategy of lumping those 
programs together 
theres more room for negotiation this way he said 
darman briefed republican senators and representatives on the 
budget early friday and told reporters afterward that it is time 
for the administration and congressional leaders to begin 
negotiating on a spending plan 
the spirit is very good at the moment and weve got to build on 
that spirit he said

supporters of laws to force broadcasters to 
present both sides of controversial issues say theyre heartened by 
the refusal of a federal appeals court to consider the 
constitutionality of such a statute 
the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia 
ruled friday that the federal communications commission properly 
used its authority in august 1987 when it repealed the socalled 
fairness doctrine 
the commission had said the doctrine written in 1949 no longer 
served the public interest as defined by the 1934 communications act 
and was unconstitutional on first amendment grounds 
the appeals court said the fcc was exercising both its 
congressionally delegated power and its expertise when it said the 
law did not serve the public interest 
but the court sidestepped the constitutionality question which 
had been a primary issue in the court challenge the doctrines 
constitutionality is likely to be tested if congress writes the 
doctrine into law again this year as expected 
the big victory here is that any law that congress passes 
will not be presumptively unconstitutional said gigi b sohn an 
attorney representing an antinuclear group whose fairness complaint 
against a syracuse ny television station led to the fccs repeal 
of the doctrine 
the courts decision leaves the door wide open for 
congressional action to codify the fairness doctrine said john h 
buchanan chairman of people for the american way a constitutional 
liberties group 
rep edward j markey dmass whose energy and commerce 
telecommunications subcommittee held hearings on a new fairness bill 
thursday also said the courts decision gave congress the green 
light to pass the measure 
i pledge that the fccs illconsidered decision to repeal the 
fairness doctrine will be remedied at expeditiously as possible 
markey said 
the fcc however said the court has vindicated the publics 
right to receive broadcast press coverage free from government 
interference 
president bush has said he would veto a fairness doctrine bill 
proponents have said they expect a first amendment test in the 
supreme court 
all three judges concurred in fridays ruling although there 
were partial dissents 
in its complaint to the fcc the antinuclear syracuse peace 
council said that wtvh a meredith corp station had not presented 
conflicting views when the station ran a series of advertisements in 
1982 that said the nine mile 2 nuclear power plant was a sound 
investment for new york 
the fcc agreed with the antinuclear group and meredith appealed 
to the fcc in 1985 on grounds the fairness doctrine violated its 
first amendment rights but the fcc denied the petition saying the 
constitutional question should be left in the hands of congress and 
the courts 
however in january 1987 the federal appeals court in washington 
ordered the fcc to consider the constitutional challenge 
congress stepped in and wrote the doctrine into law but 
president reagan vetoed the bill in june 1987 before the fcc 
repealed the doctrine 
writing for the court friday judge stephen f williams said 
the fccs decision that the fairness doctrine no longer served the 
public interest was neither arbitrary capricious nor an abuse of 
discretion

gray seals thinned out by past hunting 
and chemical pollution face a new threat this spring because warm 
temperatures have melted away their calving areas on the baltic ice 
the national news agency tt reported friday that 100 seals had 
gathered near soderhamn along the central baltic sea coast 
apparently in search of the ice floes where they usually bear their 
young 
most of the baltic is icefree and sweden is more than halfway 
through the mildest winter in recorded history 
an estimated 1500 gray seals remain in the baltic the seals 
numbered about 100000 in 1900 but were hunted through most of this 
century because they compete with commercial fishermen for their 
catch

sale of rapidfire assault rifles like the one 
used last month in a stockton calif shooting spree that left five 
children dead and 29 more wounded should be outlawed the nations 
police are telling lawmakers 
in my judgment these weapons have to go los angeles police 
chief daryl f gates told a senate judiciary subcommittee friday as 
it opened hearings on assault rifles 
the hearing spotlighted a bill being sponsored by sen howard m 
metzenbaum dohio that would ban the sale of ak47s uzis and 
other militarystyle semiautomatic rifles as well as shotguns 
equipped with drum magazines that can fire 12 blasts in three 
seconds 
sgt william pattison a nassau county ny policeman and 
executive vice president of the national association of police 
organizations had a blunt message for the committee 
our streets are becoming a combat zone he said prompt and 
decisive action by congress is needed 
on display was an arsenal of grease guns and semiautomatic 
pistols as well as such standbys as the semiautomatic adaptation of 
the ak47 long the basic weapon of communist infantrymen from 
vietnam to afghanistan 
patrick edward purdy used an ak47 on jan 17 when he opened fire 
on 400 children on a playground outside the cleveland elementary 
school in stockton calif 
five children died and 29 children were injured as well as one 
teacher 
the hearing fell silent as lori mackey a teacher at the stockton 
school told how she and her pupils huddled on their classroom floor 
while shots crackled across the schoolyard and the shadow of the 
gunman crossed back and forth across their window 
we hoped that he would not notice that we were there and that 
he would maybe think that we were at recess too she said 
since then she said nightmares and fear of strangers have 
plagued her pupils she said she has become distrustful and winces 
at unexpected sounds 
metzenbaums bill is being opposed by gun groups on grounds that 
it would outlaw not only socalled assault rifles but also 
traditional hunting rifles with a semiautomatic capacity 
in fact there is no functional difference between the two 
testified edward conroy acting deputy associate director for law 
enforcement of the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
gates scoffed at the notion that there was no way to outlaw 
assault rifles without also banning the guns of legitimate hunters 
it seems to me that were smart enough to do it he said 
i can tell you the difference because ive had two police 
officers killed with assault weapons gates said 
gang members love these weapons because in their driveby 
shootings they dont have to be marksmen they dont have to be 
sportsmen all they have to do is spray the chief said 
metzenbaum said the california episode showed that the ak47 was 
not meant for use in a duck blind 
we know of only one instance in which this was used for 
hunting he said when a psychopath in california went hunting 
school children 
representatives of some of the nations gunowner groups argued 
that firearms themselves are not the problem 
the stockton incident reflects a breakdown in the criminal 
justice system said john m snyder public affairs director of 
the washingtonbased citizens committee to keep and bear arms 
he urged tougher laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals 
national rifle association lobbyist james jay baker said 
metzenbaums bill conflicted with the second amendment to the 
constitution guaranteeing citizens the right to keep and bear arms 
it is just the kind of illconsidered legislation that the 
second amendment was designed to prevent he told metzenbaum

dan quayle in his first domestic trip as vice 
president gave a pair of speeches on human rights and democracy 
singling out cuba nicaragua israel and el salvador as needing 
improvement 
in remarks to the cuban american bar association on friday night 
the vice president attacked fidel castros cuba as an obstacle to 
democracy and human rights for the cuban people and people 
throughout the region 
it is a country that has compiled a record of brutality and 
oppression that is without parallel in the history of our 
hemisphere and it is a country whose leader has come to personify 
they tyranny that the rest of latin america is trying to cast off 
once and for all 
similarly quayle attacked nicaragua accusing the sandinista 
government of driving its citizens into exile through repression of 
freedom thus causing the massive influx of refugees into florida 
he said the bush administration currently backs the diplomatic 
efforts ongoing in central america in lieu of military aid to the 
contra rebels but added we will not yield in our determination 
to end nicaraguas threat to democracy in central america 
quayle said the usbacked government in el salvador also must 
do better on human rights 
mentioning his trip to el salvador last friday in which he 
warned the government and military that their sizable us aid might 
be jeopardized if the countrys human rights record did not improve 
quayle told the cubanamerican group i believe i succeeded in 
getting my message across 
while state department statistics show that political murders 
have declined from a high of 750 per month there in 1980 to 18 per 
month in 1988 quayle said that figure is still unacceptable 
but quayle blamed the worst human rights abuses in el salvador on 
the leftist guerrillas trying to overthrow the democratic government 
earlier in a speech to the antidefamation league of bnai 
brith quayle reinforced the recent state department report that 
faulted israels armed forces for excessive measures against 
palestinian civilians 
quayle said the number of civilian deaths in the israelioccupied 
gaza strip and west bank were clearly unacceptable 
still the vice president promised the bush administration wants 
to strengthen longstanding and close usisraeli ties

a jury found a man guilty of capital 
murder friday in the shooting and strangulation deaths of 14 family 
members then recommended that he be sentenced to die for the 
killings 
johnson county circuit judge john s patterson accepted the 
recommendation and set an execution day of march 16 for r gene 
simmons after simmons told the judge he know of no reason why he 
should not be immediatedly sentenced 
simmons who already faces the death penalty in two other 
slayings didnt visibly react to the verdict or the sentence but 
several people in the courtroom applauded 
jurors deliberated more than four hours before reaching a 
verdict and three hours later announced a sentencing 
recommendation they could have recommended life imprisonment with 
no parole 
prosecuting attorney john bynum told the jury that simmons 
deserved the death penalty because he killed some of the victims to 
avoid arrest before he completed his plan to kill them all 
eye for eye tooth for tooth life for life bynum told the 
jury thats where we are now in this case thats old and ancient 
and hard but that is what we are down to in this case 
defense attorney robert e irwin said simmons did not kill to 
escape detection 
his motive was not to avoid arrest but to satisfy a base 
primeval and vile human passion irwin said in asking the jury to 
recommend life imprisonment and then we can say a jury stood 
staunch against an onslaught of publicity irwin said 
simmons 48 has already been sentenced to die for the slayings 
of two people during a 40minute shooting rampage on dec 28 1987 
in russellville after his arrest authorities searching his home 
near dover found the bodies of simmons wife his seven children 
two of the childrens spouses and four grandchildren they had been 
all been shot or strangled 
as the jury deliberated irwin said he had received simmons 
permission to appeal if he was convicted 
simmons had waived appeal on his earlier conviction 
in his closing statement defense attorney john c harris said 
there was no evidence that placed simmons at his home at the time of 
the deaths nor any evidence that he personally fired the gun he gave 
police when he was arrested 
harris told the jury that the state was asking the jury to 
convict simmons on the basis of circumstantial evidence 
bynum said that the evidence though circumstantial was strong 
including evidence that simmons was driving his dead sons car when 
arrested owned the gun and and had it in his possession he also 
said the bodies were found at his house and that the burial of seven 
bodies and the hiding of two others showed that this was not the 
work of some phantom passerby 
during the trial friday simmons slugged bynum in front of the 
jury sending spectators shrieking and ducking beneath their seats 
law enforcement officers posted around the courtroom immediately 
swarmed over simmons subdued him and whisked him out a side door 
after a recess simmons was brought back in handcuffs and the 
state completed its case early in the afternoon the defense did not 
call any witnesses 
im all right said prosecutor bynum who was hit on the chin 
as the attorneys and defendant huddled in conference at the judges 
bench he just got me one time 
patterson who had immediately ordered the startled jurors 
removed from the courtroom brought them back before declaring a 
recess 
i want you to set aside what happened in the courtroom just 
now said patterson this trial has gone on five days we want 
to finish it if we can you need to disregard the incident that 
happened here today 
after the recess lt jay winters of the pope county sheriffs 
office read a fivepage note found in simmons safetydeposit box in 
russellville the jammed courtroom was hushed during the eight 
minutes that winters needed to enter the statement into evidence 
the statement was to simmons eldest daughter sheila mcnulty 
she was killed along with her husband and 6yearold daughter 
family members say simmons had fathered the 6yearold 
i told you that your lack of communication with me was going to 
be your downfall simmons wrote you have destroyed me and in 
time you will destroy yourself 
if you are trying to hurt me then you should be very proud of 
yourself because you have done a very good job of it you have 
destroyed me i do not want d to set foot on my property he turned 
you against me you want me out of your life i will be out of your 
life i will see you in hell 
simmons sat with downcast eyes while the statement was read 
shortly after winters finished the state rested its case 
after a break the defense said it would stand on its previous 
motions 
in testimony before the morning disruption firearms expert 
burwin monroe of the state crime lab in little rock testified that a 
22caliber revolver simmons handed over when he was arrested fired 
the bullets that killed several of the family members

president bush says hes putting the 
volatile issue of congressional pay raises on the back burner 
delaying any new move until the timing is right 
chatting with reporters en route to this seacoast resort from a 
summit in ottawa with canadian prime minister brian mulroney bush 
said there had been a lot of wounds a lot of hemorrhaging on 
capitol hill over the pay raises 
the president said that while he signed house and senate 
legislation rejecting a 51 percent pay raise he still believes in a 
substantial increase for congress the federal judiciary and top 
government executives 
closing out the third full week of his presidency bush on friday 
gave mulroney personal assurances that he would move as quickly 
as possible to attack the acid rain pollution problem in the united 
states which also has harmed canadas environment 
but the president gave the canadian prime minister no precise 
timetables for reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions 
from coalburning plants mostly in the industrial midwest 
bush said he believed mulroney was reasonably well satisfied 
with his statements on the issue 
said he had not talked to secretary of state james a baker iii 
about reports that baker faces a potential conflictofinterest 
problem 
i know there is nobody more ethical than jim baker bush told 
reporters aboard air force one as he headed to his family compound 
for a weekend of relaxation 
baker told reporters in ottawa he is seeking a waiver from 
ethical requirements so he could continue to hold stock in chemical 
new york corp a bank holding company that has lent some 45 
billion to third world countries 
maintained there is no inflation scare in the united states 
despite fresh producer price figures showing a full percentage point 
increase during january this translated into an annual inflation 
rate of 127 percent 
i would not make assumptions based on one monthly release 
bush said and i am not overly concerned about inflation at this 
point he did say however that i dont like the figures 
said that im very pleased with congressional reaction to 
the 116 trillion fiscal 1990 budget he proposed to a joint session 
of the house and senate 
bush acknowledged his plan did not go into detail on what areas 
of spending should be cut saying theres a big black hole in the 
budget 
but he also said that i did what i said id do heres what i 
want to do he said he was certainly conscious of the fact 
that there would be arguments with lawmakers over spending 
priorities 
bush planned a relatively quiet weekend with his wife barbara 
and other family members he said he likely would go to church 
sunday and hinted that he might go out jogging saying that he had 
been unable to get enough exercise recently because he suffered from 
a cold 
on the lingering question of pay raises for congress judges and 
senior executives bush retreated somewhat from his statement of 
last wednesday when he suggested he would propose a new pay package 
in the wake of the congressional defeat of the 51 percent raise 
all i can do is make recommendations to the congress about the 
future legislation he said but he said that i dont want to do 
something thatll look like i am simply trying to step into the 
breach and raise a problem that already has caused a great deal of 
divisiveness in the capitol 
thats not what i want to do he said ive got to rely on 
my people here to make a recommendation to me when i can be 
effective for the changes that i think are overdue bush said 
but what you dont want to do is come in and when the wounded 
are still lying on the battlefield and start fighting another 
battle he said lets take a little time im not sure the 
timing is right i think weve got to let the dust settle over that 
battlefield

is murderous and thieving so which one should be the state 
bird of montana

session and emotions are running pretty high 
the present state bird is the meadowlark but rep tom hannah 
says it deserts the state every winter just when residents need 
cheering up most 
enter the magpie the blackandwhite scavenger of the plains 
hes pretty hes easily seen along almost any highway in 
montana even at temperatures of up to 40 and 50 below he is no 
fairweather friend hannah said recently he is the magpie 
but such talk doesnt always sit well with montanans 
stan howe a humor columnist for the great falls tribune 
endorsed the magpie as state bird two years ago prompting a flock 
of angry letters 
magpies eat the eggs of more desirable birds and peck through the 
hides of cows readers wrote the most charitable adjectives tribune 
letterwriters found for the magpie were murderous and 
thieving 
just as things were getting ugly the yellowstone chapter of the 
audubon society stepped in and depending on ones outlook either 
defended the magpie or defamed the bald eagle 
we know that in some quarters the bird isnt highly thought 
of said gordon weber of the audubon society however hannah 
said people just dont realize hes in the same class as the 
american eagle he eats dead things

europes top trade official wants the 
bush administration to take the lead in resolving a transatlantic 
dispute touched off by a ban on imports of hormonetreated meat from 
the united states 
the european economic community on jan 1 banned imports of meat 
from cattle treated with growth hormones the united states refused 
to comply and slapped stiff duties on a variety of european 
products the eec has threatened to strike back with retaliatory 
tariffs 
frans andriessen the newly appointed trade chief for the eec 
acknowledged finding a solution will be difficult 
i dont know what can be done what we cannot do is change 
fundamentally our legislation banning the meat he said in an 
interview friday in his office at the headquarters of the 12nation 
trading bloc 
the europeans contend the stimulants pose a health risk a claim 
the united states disputes american farmers use the hormones to 
boost growth rates in cattle 
andriessen a former dutch finance minister said he intends to 
discuss the troublesome issue next week when he travels to 
washington to meet with us trade representative carla hills and 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
he said he recently talked on the telephone to mrs hills and 
both agreed we should do lots of thinking to find some kind of 
solution because nobody wants this matter to escalate 
still he said the initiative should come from the united states 
i think they should start we are thinking as well but our 
possibilities are limited since we believe that this legislation 
is in complete conformity with our international obligations he 
said 
so i think some kind of signal from the united states would 
be very helpful he said 
he said the eec has received no fresh proposals from washington 
on thursday the united states blocked a european demand for an 
international investigation of the american retaliatory measures 
saying more contacts between the giant trading partners would be 
useful 
european foreign ministers gather in brussels feb 20 to decide 
whether to apply counterretaliatory measures against the united 
states the ministers threatened last month to impose high duties on 
imports of american dried fruit and walnuts if no progress was made 
in resolving the dispute 
the actions of the united states until now are not very 
encouraging andriessen said 
the ban is expected to block the import of about 100 million 
worth of beef and beef byproducts from the united states meat used 
to make pet food is exempt 
total trade between the eec and the united states reached an 
estimated 166 billion last year 
andriessen dismissed us concerns that the common market would 
try to build up barriers to foreign goods as it moved closer to 
forming a single market of the 12 countries in 1992 
he said the european nations depend on trade with other countries 
to sell their exports and buy needed imports and have no reason to 
create a fortress europe 
it is not in our interest and its not our intention and it 
will not be the result he said 
the united sates is a very good client as we are very good 
clients for the united states he said 
sometimes ive asked myself in agriculture why is it that the 
united states is always quarreling with its best client he said 
i dont understand that 
common market members are belgium britain denmark france 
germany greece ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands 
portugal and spain

a byelection sunday is seen as a test of the damage 
done to prime minister noboru takeshitas party by a stocktrading 
scandal that has forced the resignation of three cabinet members 
the governing liberal democratic party is battling hard to retain 
the partys control of a parliament seat of a member who died dec 
23 
the voting on the southern island of kyushu is the first 
election to a national office since the scandal began last summer 
some newspapers predict the leading opposition group the japan 
socialist party could win dealing a serious blow to the liberal 
democrats 
suspicions of bribery and influencepeddling have takeshita 
facing opposition pressure to resign or to at least account for his 
links to the information services conglomerate recruit co 
the election in kyushu is viewed as an indicator of what could 
happen in july elections for half the upper house where the liberal 
democrats hold 143 of the 251 seats 
severe setbacks in the elections would endanger takeshitas 
chances next october to win another twoyear term as party president 
and prime minister commentators say 
a poll conducted by japans largest newspaper the yomiuri 
shimbun shows socialist sadao fuchigami with a slim lead over the 
liberal democrats kei oma the newspaper reported friday 
two other opposition candidates tatsuzen fujino of the japan 
communist party and kozo maeda of the salaried workers new party 
are also contesting the seat 
the uproar over recruit began when it was discovered that founder 
hiromasa ezoe sold unlisted shares in the recruit subsiary at 
bargain prices to more than 150 influential politicians 
bureaucrats journalists and businessmen before the shares began 
trading publicly in october 1986 
share prices rose sharply then and some shareholders gained more 
than 80000 in profits that were tax free because japan has no 
capital gains tax 
the scandal has cost takeshita three cabinet ministers and his 
popularity has plunged prompting him to announce a review of 
government ethics 
i have vowed to myself that i must honestly accept the harsh 
criticism must join hands with you and must restore the 
peoples trust in politics takeshita told parliament friday he 
called political reform his no 1 priority issue 
many lawmakers say without campaign finance reform nothing can 
be done to remove the network of obligations and expenses that 
traditionally link businessmen and politicians 
japan is a giftgiving society and politicians gain voter 
support by presenting cash gifts at funerals and weddings of their 
constituents 
a typical legislator also has to spend more than 790000 a year 
on personnel office rental phone and mailing costs said liberal 
democratic lawmaker kazuo aichi in a letter to his constituents 
the government pays salaries of only two staff members and no 
matching government funds exist to help finance campaigns 
politicians devote enormous efforts to raising money leaning on 
businesses and colleagues to buy tickets to fundraising parties in 
return business circles expect some political influence

agency later reported that the injured passengers were being treated 
at the comandante pedro sotto alba hospital in moa cuba

responsibilities to cuba said coast guard spokesman daniel white 
the three missing men were apparently in a cabin at the stern of 
the 350foot freighter which sank when the celebration sliced it in 
two said luis diaz another coast guard spokesman the bow section 
floated for hours before sinking at about 10 am 
the three missing crewmen included the ships capt manuel

toxic materials saturate a lake near one siberian 
city to such an extent that stray dogs are regularly tossed into the 
water to disintegrate 
a chemical plant on the volga river is so hazardous that 
employees routinely take medical retirement at the age of 45 
the rate of sickness from natural gas poisoning was so high in 
one village that the entire town was moved away from a gas 
processing plant 
those environmental horror stories are just three of the items 
that appeared friday in soviet newspapers an indication not only of 
the sorry state of the environment but the new aggressiveness the 
media has acquired for environmental reporting 
such reporting is now sanctioned under the regime of president 
mikhail s gorbachev as good citizenship rather than antisoviet 
treachery 
in the siberian city of kemerovo stray dogs that are not sent to 
research laboratories or converted into fur boots and hats are 
simply tossed into a lake filled with toxic phenols from a local 
chemical plant the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda reported 
after several days no trace is left the newspaper said it 
was not clear if the paper was referring to live or dead dogs being 
tossed into the river 
pravda reported that the volga river city of chapaevsk is known 
locally as the city of young pensioners because the chemical 
factory there retires so many people when they reach 45 to 50 years 
of age 
the newspaper socialist industry reported that moscows air 
contains double the allowable amount of hydrocarbons and that 
ceilings on nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide are exceeded by 30 
percent 
it said city water contains five to 20 times the permitted amount 
of fertilizers and other toxic chemicals 
the paper said moscow already has moved 174 factories outside the 
city limits in hopes of reducing its pollution problem authorities 
had hoped to move 446 factories outside the city by 1990 but it now 
appears that goal will not be reached until the year 2000 the 
newspaper said 
the entire village of muzhichya pavlovka has been moved away from 
a local gas processing plant after 76 people suffered natural gas 
poisoning in january the newspaper nedelya reported

veteran prime minister felipe gonzalez 
sought to play down reports he will step down or call early 
elections in the face of union conflicts that have set off fears of 
sustained labor unrest 
at a news conference friday the 46yearold gonzalez appearing 
confident and relaxed said the unions could not determine his 
socialist partys policies 
responding to rumors of his early resignation gonzalez said 
in politics to comment about these things does nothing more than 
contribute to an increase in rumors 
he said conflict with the unions would not affect spains current 
sixmonth presidency of the european economic community 
this work will not be affected by a greater or lesser amount of 
social conflict he said 
gonzalez also pledged that his 6yearold government would make 
a maximum effort to keep on track spains annual 5 percent 
economic growth rate the highest in europe 
the prime ministers comments came three days after the collapse 
of six weeks of talks between the government and unions over 
unemployment and pension benefits the collapse set off fears of 
labor strife expected to last through the spring 
some political leaders have called either for my resignation or 
new elections gonzalez said 
id like to tell the communist leaders who propose this that 
perhaps id like to consider it but not for the reasons that they 
logically want 
gonzalez was referring to a call for his resignation wednesday by 
leaders of a small leftist parliamentary coalition the coalition 
believes that elections now would favor them because the socialists 
have lost voter support 
elections must be held by june 1990 
a poll published last week in the newsweekly cambio 16 indicated 
the socialists would receive 35 percent of the vote if elections 
were called now a drop from the 44 percent they won in june 1986 
elections 
the socialists hold 183 of the 350 seats in the lower house of 
parliament 
last december the general workers union a former socialist party 
ally and the communist workers commissions staged a general strike 
that brought spain to a standstill for 24 hours 
after a nearly sevenhour negotiation session tuesday the unions 
rejected a government offer of 33 billion to broaden unemployment 
insurance increase basic pensions and raise the minimum wage they 
maintained their demand for increased benefits totaling 36 billion 
the prime minister said the collapse of the talks is not just a 
failure for the government but also a failure for the unions 
he said maintaining spains high economic growth rate was 
fundamental to reducing the countrys 188 percent unemployment 
europes highest 
in governing sometimes its preferable to put at risk ones 
loss of popularity than to assume the risk of not taking advantage 
of the opportunities for economic growth he said

wayne l hays who rose from 
smalltown mayor to one of the most powerful positions in congress 
only to see his career ruined by a sexandpayroll scandal in 1976 
died of a heart attack he was 77 
hays served 14 terms in congress and earned a reputation as a 
tough effective legislator feared by those who crossed him but he 
is remembered mainly for his liaison with elizabeth ray the house 
clerk who declared i cant type i cant file i cant even 
answer the phone 
hays suffered a heart attack at home around 115 pm friday 
said his second wife pat he died a little more than an hour later 
at wheeling hospital in nearby wheeling wva hospital spokeswoman 
linda crook said 
mrs hays said her husband was reading a book about franklin d 
roosevelt before suffering the attack 
a private funeral was set for monday 
hays who was first elected to congress in 1948 resigned on 
sept 1 1976 halting a house ethics committee investigation into 
his affair with ms ray 
the scandal broke in the spring of 1976 when ms ray then 33 
told the washington post about her relationship with the congressman 
hays initially denied the report saying hells fire im a 
very happily married man 
he subsequently acknowledged the affair but denied ms rays 
allegation that he was paying her 14000 a year in federal money 
only to have sex with him 
after hays resigned the justice department which also was 
investigating the matter decided not to prosecute citing a lack of 
evidence corroborating ms rays account of her relationship with 
hays 
hays grew up in bannock a community of 350 people in the coal 
fields of eastern ohio after studying at ohio state and duke 
universities he began teaching history and public speaking at a 
high school near his hometown 
he was elected mayor of nearby flushing a town of 1200 people 
in 1939 and later served briefly in the ohio senate in 1948 hays 
won his first term in congress 
he became chairman of the house administration committee in 1971 
and chairman of the house democratic congressional campaign 
committee two years later 
the former job gave him significant power within the house 
because the administration committee controlled everything from 
house restaurants to staff payrolls 
rep donald lukens rohio said hays ran his committee with 
the iron hand of absolute control 
he was fierce in his attack and would take on anyone in the 
house on an issue in which he had an interest said rep louis 
stokes dean of ohios democratic delegation in the house if you 
didnt stand up to him he didnt have much respect for you 
despite hays washington reputation as the capitol hill bully 
many of his heavily bluecollar constituency saw him as a man who 
got things done such as pushing through pensions for blacklung 
coal disease victims or getting official documents such as army 
discharge papers and passports 
even after his relationship with ms ray became known hays won 
the 1976 primary for his congressional seat with 62 percent of the 
vote but the scandal ended his hopes of running for governor 
two days after the primary hays was rushed to a hospital in a 
coma from an overdose of sleeping tablets he emerged from the coma 
in less than 24 hours but remained in the hospital for nine days he 
said the overdose was accidental 
after leaving congress hays returned to a 300acre farm where he

pakistan prime minister benazir bhutto arrived 
today in china beginning her first official visit abroad by 
following in the footsteps of her late father who cultivated close 
ties with beijing 
bhutto was greeted by about 200 screaming pakistani residents at 
the citys old airport which is used for important guests 
long live benazir bhutto read banners carried by the crowd 
long live pakistanchina friendship 
in a break with normal procedure the 35yearold prime minister 
did not immediately get in a waiting limousine instead she walked 
the line of wellwishers shaking hands and saying hi 
pakistans relations with china are very close and friendly 
she told chinas official xinhua news agency in an interview before 
her departure my visit would give a further boost to these 
relations 
this is bhuttos third visit to china she came in the early 
1970s at the invitation of the late premier chou enlai and with 
her father the late prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto on a state 
visit in 1976 
bhutto became prime minister after national elections in 
november soon after she took office she traveled to saudi arabia 
on a personal visit to mecca 
bhuttos predecessor the late president mohammed zia ulhaq 
died in a suspicious plane crash in august 
while in china bhutto will meet with chinas top leaders and is 
expected to sign two agreements of limited importance a barter 
trade agreement and an agreement on the mutual protection of 
investment 
on sunday she meets premier li peng and communist party chief 
zhao ziyang on monday she flies to shanghai for meetings with 
senior leader deng xiaoping 
xinhua said the issue of the afghan war would dominate bhutos 
talks in china 
along with the united states china and pakistan have been the 
main backers of the afghan rebels fighting the sovietbacked 
government in kabul china and pakistan are expected to discuss 
their next step as the feb 15 deadline for a soviet withdrawal 
approaches 
it is significant that bhutto chose china as her first official 
destination 
despite momentous political changes coups and wars in pakistan 
the cultural revolution in china the relationship between the two 
countries has improved steadily since january 1950 when islamabad 
first recognized beijing 
for bhutto herself the chinese have done a great deal in the 
short time she has been in office 
in the three days after the general election in november chinas 
ambassador to pakistan met with bhutto three times in highly 
publicized meetings 
given chinas close relationship with pakistans powerful 
military the move was a clear sign of beijings support of an 
orderly transfer of power in islamabad asian diplomats said 
for china the visit comes at a time of great fluidity in its 
relations with the rest of asia beijings improving ties with india 
and the soviet union no longer make pakistan a natural ally but 
factors such as the close relationship with the pakistan military 
guarantee close ties for some time to come 
indeed 50 percent of pakistans 400plane air force comes from 
china as do 1100 of pakistans 1600 tanks according to the 
stockholm international peace research institute only the united 
states sells more weapons to pakistan 
china also helps pakistan with its nuclear industry the two 
countries signed an agreement in september 1986 
both china and pakistan have denied the aid has military 
applications but western diplomats say they are convinced that 
cooperation in this field is not limited to electricity 
pakistan was among the first countries to recognize beijing after 
communist china was established in 1949 
relations between the two countries were very good during the 
administration of bhuttos father who visited china three times 
when he was president and prime minister from 197176 
the relationship improved even more under zia who ousted the 
elder bhutto in a coup and had him hanged in 1979 the introduction 
of hundreds of thousands of soviet troops into afghanistan further 
boosted the ties

a computer operator who is one of 11 formerly 
terminal cancer patients saved by revolutionary transplant surgery 
says the multipleorgan operation was her only hope of survival 
i probably had a couple more months of life left diana 
hancock 40 of burlington wis said friday from her room at 
presbyterianuniversity hospital this was a future for me 
ms hancock and 10 others are living free of malignancy after 
receiving four new abdominal organs and being left with little or no 
stomach said transplant pioneer dr thomas e starzl of the 
university of pittsburgh 
were pushing ourselves to the limit starzl said in an 
interview 
the transplants believed to be the first of their kind have 
been performed on 10 men and three women since june at 
presbyterianuniversity two patients died one of them following a 
second transplant starzl said 
its a phenomenal accomplishment said dr israel penn 
professor of surgery at the university of cincinnati who keeps a 
worldwide transplant tumor registry to keep patients alive 
successfully with a big operation like this indicates that 
transplantation is really advancing 
all 13 patients were near death and their tumors were inoperable 
starzl said all but the most recent survivors including ms 
hancock who underwent the surgery jan 13 are home the latest 
transplant was performed monday 
surgical teams removed each patients liver pancreas most or 
all of the stomach twothirds of the colon and the duodenum a 
10inchlong section of the small intestine 
the cavity was filled with a block of organs consisting of the 
liver pancreas duodenum and jejunum a few feet of section of the 
small intestine 
the stomach was not replaced since it is nonessential for 
digestion which can be performed by intestines starzl said 
because she has no stomach ms hancock must eat six small meals 
a day spaced an hour or two apart half a sandwich easily fills her 
up 
you try not to drink with your meals because liquid takes up 
the space you know when youve had enough said ms hancock who 
expects to be discharged in a few days 
starzl said the procedure is a miniversion of the fiveorgan 
transplants performed next door at childrens hospital of pittsburgh 
on two 3yearolds tabatha foster of madisonville ky survived 
six months before dying in may 1988 and rolandrea dodge of 
fruitland nm died last month six weeks after surgery 
both girls died of lymphoproliferative disease an abnormal 
proliferation of lymphoids or white blood cells that obstructed 
the liver officials said each had received a new liver pancreas 
stomach small intestine and part of a large intestine 
we need better tools such as antirejection medication for 
transplants involving the entire digestive system starzl said we 
need to be able to manage these socalled lymphoids 
abdominal transplantation involving multiple organs is not an 
allornone procedure he said the soundness of the surgery is 
exemplified by the 13 procedures 
as of dec 31 about 1100 people with malignant tumors had 
undergone liver kidney heart or bone marrow transplants worldwide 
according to penn eight months of cancerfree survival following a 
multipleorgan transplant is revolutionary he said 
what hes trying to do is remove the entire tumor plus all 
areas where its most likely to spread to in hopes of curing the 
cancer altogether penn said theres one catch if the cancer 
has spread undetected beyond the limits of his dissection 
starzl said he is limiting the new procedure at least for now 
to cancer patients less than 45 years old 
its a limited operation at present we have to see what 
happens said dr lewis teperman part of the transplant team 
but i think its a giant step forward

the swedish commander of the un 
peacekeeping force in south lebanon has reprimanded a norwegian 
officer for comparing israeli army actions there to those of the 
nazis in world war ii a un source said 
the source at unifil or the un interim force in lebanon said 
maj gen larseric wahlgren reprimanded lt col je karlsen 
commander of the norwegian battalion on thursday he spoke on 
condition of anonymity and did give any other details 
karlsen made the remark feb 2 during a private meeting between 
israeli and unifil officers to discuss the expulsions of 79 lebanese 
villagers from israels selfdeclared security zone in southern 
lebanon it was leaked to israeli media 
the israeli foreign ministry initially protested karlsens 
remark then demanded his removal after he said in a newspaper 
interview that the comparison succeeded in drawing attention to the 
expulsion of the lebanese villagers 
in world war ii my fellow countrymen sacrificed their lives in 
the struggle against the nazis who were trying to expel jews from 
norway nowadays you behave in south lebanon exactly as the nazis 
did karlsen was quoted as saying 
unifil spokesman timur goksel reached by telephone said 
wahlgren called karlsen to an hourlong meeting at the force 
headquarters in the southern border town of naqoura he refused to 
elaborate 
sixtyfive of the deportees were from unifils 
norwegianpatrolled zone 
lebanon has lodged a complaint with the un security council 
against the expulsions 
lebanons foreign ministry said 37 of those expelled were from 
the sunni moslem village of shibaa which refused to cooperate with 
the israelisupported south lebanon army militia that patrols the 
security zone with israeli troops 
the 5800strong unifil drawn from nine nations mans a narrow 
strip north of the security zone it has been deployed in south 
lebanon since march 1978 
israel carved out the sixto10milewide strip when it withdrew 
the bulk of its occupation army from south lebanon in 1985 
the strip which extends from the mediterranean coast in the west 
to the slopes of mount hermon in the east serves as a buffer 
against crossborder guerrilla attacks into northern israel

the government says the lowest january price 
rise in 11 years and the return to mexico of about 700 million in 
capital last month is proof its antiinflation plan is working 
the bank of mexico said consumer prices rose 24 percent in 
january the lowest for that month since 1978 the government 
newspaper el nacional reported friday 
the national consumer price index rose by 09 percent the latter 
half of the month the central bank said higher prices for 
services rents telephones medicines and automotive insurance 
rates spurred january inflation it said 
still inflationary momentum has inched upward in recent months 
with prices rising by 21 percent in december the previous highest 
monthly inflation rate was 31 percent in april 
the government froze wages prices and the peso exchange rate in 
february 1988 in a bid to curb inflation that reached a record 1592 
percent in 1987 
consumer prices rose by 517 percent last year under the plan 
the central bank in its monthly publication said an estimated 
700 million in capital returned to the country last month 
it said investors were encouraged by a gradual peso currency 
devaluation instituted on jan 1 and lower domestic interest rates 
the devaluation has averaged one peso per day 
analysts have said the government adopted the devaluation to 
thwart investor speculation that it was planning a major onetime 
currency adjustment 
mexicos international reserves plunged from 16 billion in april 
to less than 10 billion by december according to private estimates 
the run on reserves was attributed to fears of currency 
devaluation prepayments of private sector foreign debts and 
depressed revenues from oil mexicos leading export commodity

president daniel ortega has been trying 
to tidy his economic and political house before a regional summit 
monday mindful that nicaragua needs international help to save 
itself from economic disaster 
but the opposition said ortegas proposals are merely window 
dressing and do not seriously address the political problems at the 
heart of nicaraguas economic crisis 
ortega in meetings with opposition parties raised the 
possibility of reforming electoral laws calling early elections and 
granting amnesty to members of deposed president anastasio somozas 
national guard the official sandinista newspaper barricada said 
friday 
thousands of guardsmen were imprisoned after the sandinistas took 
power in 1979 and in december the government said it still had more 
than 1700 guardsmen in custody and 1300 captured antisandinista 
rebels 
on wednesday the leftist sandinista government made another 
conciliatory gesture allowing two former somoza military officers 
to leave the country after they had spent nearly 10 years at the 
venezuelan embassy under political asylum 
an 18monthold regional peace plan which ortega and the 
presidents of el salvador honduras guatemala and costa rica will 
try to revive at their summit calls for democratic reforms 
amnesties for political prisoners and talks with the internal 
opposition in the five countries 
ortega goes into the summit believing his forces have all but 
beaten the ussupported guerrilla movement although scattered 
fighting still occurs 
the united states and central american nations have been 
demanding nicaraguas leftist sandinista government make more 
democratic reforms as promised 
if in nicaragua there is no democratization there wont be a 
lasting peace ariel bravo of the opposition marxistleninist 
party said in an interview friday 
if the government agrees to allow freedom of expression the 
capitalists will start investing the market comes alive bravo 
said thats what they businessmen want a guarantee 
the opposition nicaraguan democratic coordinate said friday that 
the government failed to comply with the regional peace plan while 
making it appear it is seeking business and opposition support for 
recent austerity measures under the guise of a pretended economic 
and political agreement 
the coalition of private business groups labor unions and 
political parties also urged the government to agree to 
constitutional reforms to ensure freedom of expression and changes 
in laws that now guarantee sandinista control over the results of 
any election 
elections for posts from president to town mayors are scheduled 
for november 1990 
nicaragua needs the injections of money that western lending 
markets can provide those sources dried up after the united states 
imposed a trade embargo on nicaragua in 1985 four years after the 
rebels began receiving us military aid 
the ruling sandinista national liberation front is firmly in 
power but its rule could be threatened by the sharp budget cuts and 
layoffs it has outlined to contain runaway inflation 
inflation rates reached 20000 percent last year and exports have 
fallen for five years 
ortega goes to the summit in dire need of foreign aid and loans 
for nicaragua that might be forthcoming only after political 
reforms opposition and business groups have taken a waitandsee 
attitude toward the governments apparent attempts at rapprochement 
everybody talks about credibility said bravo the 
sandinistas have lied to us so many times we dont believe them 
anymore 
ortega recently spoke of consolidating nicaraguas historical 
victory over the contra rebels and of normalizing relations with 
the new bush administration which he called more pragmatic than 
that of former president reagan

cambodias unpredictable prince norodom sihanouk 
has decided to retake his post as president of the antivietnam 
resistance thailands foreign minister said today 
sihanouk resigned irrevocably one year ago because of 
differences with the khmer rouge one of the three factions in the 
resistance coalition 
sihanouk now has resumed his post again as president of the 
resistance government visiting foreign minister siddhi savetsila 
told reporters in beijing 
siddhi said the 66yearold prince conveyed his decision in a 
breakfast meeting today at sihanouks residence in beijing 
an aide to sihanouk contacted at the residence confirmed the 
prince was again president of democratic kampuchea the resistance 
government 
earlier this week sihanouk met with khieu samphan head of the 
khmer rouge and other resistance leaders to map out strategy for 
peace talks to be held in jakarta indonesia later this month 
at a thursday news conference khieu samphan and his partners 
announced proposals for un personnel to supervise the withdrawal 
of vietnamese troops from cambodia and the establishment of a 
fourparty coalition government which would include the 
vietnambacked cambodian government of hun sen 
the resistance leaders however did not say anything about 
sihanouk returning to his official position despite sihanouks 
quitting as president the resistance has continued to regard him as 
the only man with enough popular support to unite the nation 
it was not clear whether sihanouk had resolved his differences 
with the khmer rouge the prince last year cited khmer rouge attacks 
on his guerrilla army as a main reason for his decision to step down 
as president 
sihanouk now says the khmer rouge must be part of any future 
coalition government but in a statement friday he said i 
solemnly declare that there is no question of letting mr pol pot 
return to power 
pol pot was the khmer rouge leader when the radical communists 
ruled the country from 1975 to 1978 during which time an estimated 
about 2 million of cambodias 8 million people died from executions 
famine and civil unrest 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 to drive the khmer rouge 
from power 
the resistance wants a un force to be put in place to ensure 
that vietnam ends its 10year military incursion in cambodia and to 
keep the peace after the vietnamese leave 
vietnam which has said it will remove all its troops by 
september if a peace settlement is in place opposes bringing in 
foreign military personnel vietnam says it has 50000 troops in 
cambodia but western estimates are much higher

a drifter who posed as an american indian was 
sentenced to life in prison for murdering and sexually mutilating 
three indian women a decision that was applauded by indian 
activists 
everybodys happy said eleanor evans one of several 
american indian movement activists who were in the courtroom friday 
night for the sentencing of billy glaze 45 
i think there is a sense of relief added aim member don 
mccoy it has a tendency to restore my faith in the legal system 
and it alleviated some fears 
jurors convicted glaze on three counts of firstdegree murder and 
three counts of seconddegree murder in the slayings of kathleen 
bullman 19 angeline whitebirdsweet 26 and angela green 21 in 
1986 and 1987 police believe the women met their killer in taverns 
glaze showed no sign of emotion as the verdict was read earlier 
friday night but softly told hennepin county judge jonathan 
lebedoff im not the serial killer 
lebedoff sentenced him to three life sentences to be served 
consecutively making him eligible for parole in 52 years 
i have no reason to dispute the legitimacy of the findings of 
the jury the judge said noting that minnesota does not have the 
death penalty he told glaze it was his strong wish that you serve 
the rest of your life in prison 
the horrors that weve been privy to over the last few weeks 
cannot be undone by any sentence lebedoff said theres nothing 
i can do to turn back the clock 
the jury found that glaze had killed the three women while 
sexually assaulting them resulting in an automatic finding of 
firstdegree murder under minnesota law the conviction on 
seconddegree murder charges reflects the jurys finding that the 
crimes were not premeditated 
the 35hour deliberations began tuesday after a twoweek trial 
during the trial leroy hamblin a transient testified that he 
witnessed bullmans murder and identified glaze as the killer 
hamblin who said he had been drinking and smoking marijuana at the 
time said he was afraid to stop the killing 
other prosecution witnesses testified that glaze told them he had 
killed the women 
assistant hennepin county attorney pete connors a prosecutor in 
the case said in his closing statement that glazes motive was that 
he hated indian women 
he had a fury in his gut he wanted to hurt them badly he told 
people that connors said 
but glazes attorney michael colich said the state had failed 
to prove that glaze killed anyone glaze did not testify he 
characterized glaze as a nonviolent drifter who called attention to 
himself by saying despicable things about women

three mysterious fires broke out 
within hours of each other in metropolitan manila leaving thousands 
of people homeless police said today 
the first fire broke out friday afternoon in manilas slum 
district of tondo touching off an eighthour blaze that gutted 
about 2000 houses said arson investigator sgt baltazar dimagiba 
the cause of the fire is still under investigation he said 
at least three firemen and a woman suffered burns or minor 
injuries during the fire dimagiba said he said several people 
mostly children were missing but there were no reports of deaths 
several manila newspapers reported five people were missing and 
presumed to have died in the fire radio dzmm reported that among 
the dead was a looter who was beaten by irate fire victims and 
thrown into the blaze 
the reports could not be immediately confirmed dimagiba said 
he said firefighters had difficulty in putting out the fire 
because hundreds of shanties made of cardboard and lightwooden 
materials blocked many side streets 
dimagiba estimated 2000 houses were razed in a fourblock radius 
and up to 15000 people had been rendered homeless by the fire 
because most of the houses are being shared by at least three 
families 
they had to share small houses to minimize the cost of 
living dimagiba said 
two hours after the fire was put under control a second fire of 
unknown origin began a street away and burned down four other 
houses dimagiba added 
in manilas suburb of san juan fire broke out this afternoon on 
the first floor of the a 12story commercial building but firemen on 
the scene said the blaze was under control

president bush has agreed with advisers that the 
withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan is no reason to cut 
military aid to the afghan rebels the new york times reported today 
as long as afghan leader najibullah holds on the potential 
and risk of soviet activity is very much alive the times quoted 
an unidentified senior administration official as saying 
if the administration took the policy decision to cut off aid 
because of soviet good behavior it would be hard to get started 
again if the soviets start up again the official said 
the times said bush accepted the recommendation to continue the 
aid as long as the sovietbacked afghan government is in power 
the newspaper said senior foreign policy advisers suggested it at 
a friday meeting of the national security council 
the times quoted unidentified senior administration officials as 
saying that although the soviets are withdrawing troops from 
afghanistan they continue to leave behind large amounts of military 
equipment 
administration officials asserted that the decision does not 
reflect a change in policy but rather a change in emphasis the 
newspaper said 
our basic policy is support for the resistance a senior 
state department official said our policy remains one of positive 
symmetry 
we never said our support to the rebels would be proportional 
to what the soviets sent the official added 
the soviet union has repeatedly urged the united states to 
discontinue aid to the rebels especially in light of its withdrawal 
earlier this month 
us aid to afghan rebels is estimated to have totaled 600 
million last year

r gene simmons was sentenced to death 
for murdering 14 members of his family in a rampage that his own 
attorney said was motivated by a base primeval and vile human 
passion 
simmons who is already under a death sentence in two related 
slayings was convicted and sentenced in rapid succession friday 
hours after he stunned jurors by attacking the prosecutor in his 
trial 
johnson county circuit judge john s patterson accepted the 
jurys recommendation and set the execution for march 16 after 
simmons said he knew of no reason why he should not be immediatedly 
sentenced 
simmons 48 who was handcuffed after punching prosecutor john 
bynum earlier in the day displayed no emotion as jurors returned 
the guilty verdicts at 830 pm he was similarly impassive when 
they returned less than three hours later with the sentence of death 
by lethal injection 
eye for eye tooth for tooth life for life bynum said 
during closing arguments earlier in the day thats where we are 
in this case thats old and ancient and hard but that is what we 
are down to in this case 
the verdict and sentence brought a swift end to a brief trial 
that began with jury selection monday and included just 18 
prosecution witnesses the defense did not present a case 
in closing arguments defense attorney john harris said no 
evidence had been presented to prove that simmons was at his house 
when the victims were killed and said there was no evidence he had 
fired the gun that he handed over to authorities when he was 
arrested 
after simmons was convicted but before he was sentenced the 
defense pleaded with the jury to reject the states contention that 
simmons killed some of his victims to avoid detection before he 
killed them all 
his motive was not to avoid arrest but to satisfy a base 
primeval and vile human passion running amok without regard to 
arrest said defense attorney robert e doc irwin 
the 14 family members killed by simmons included his wife his 
seven children two of the childrens spouses and four 
grandchildren among them was a 24yearold daughter with whom 
simmons allegedly had an incestuous relationship 
their bodies were found by police on dec 28 and dec 29 1987 
in and around simmons house 25 miles southeast of clarksville in 
northwest arkansas autopsy reports said they had been shot or 
strangled and had died two to six days before they were found 
authorities went to simmons house following his arrest dec 28 
after he shot six people two fatally at four businesses in nearby 
russellville simmons was convicted of murder in those deaths last 
may and sentenced to death 
simmons waived his right to appeal in that case and pleaded to be 
executed as soon as possible the execution has been delayed 
however because of a legal challenge by an arkansas minister 
irwin said simmons has consented to an appeal of the latest 
conviction 
simmons shocked court observers during a routine conference at 
the judges bench friday morning when he suddenly lunged between 
lawyers and struck bynum the prosecutor in the chin simmons 
punched again missed and was subdued by court officers 
the tape recording of court stenographer johna roedenbeck 
recorded a voice saying hes trying to get a gun and another 
voice saying ive got it 
jurors watched wideeyed and some relatives of the slain family 
members dove for the floor 
we were scared to death said charlotte crosston whose 
daughter and soninlaw died in the murder spree our legs were 
like rubber im glad he showed the jury and im glad the jury got 
to see what hes really like 
before the trial resumed patterson told simmons he was 
disappointed in the defendants behavior and asked can you give 
me any assurance youll behave yourself 
i can but i dont have anything to say simmons replied

the sailboat thursdays child was a day 
behind schedule in its effort to beat the new yorktosan francisco 
record set 135 years ago by the clipper flying cloud but its tired 
crew pressed on 
the yacht had been expected to arrive in san francisco bay on 
friday but that prediction was revised after the sloop made 
miserable progress in a limp northerly breeze 
thursdays child was 197 miles south of the golden gate on 
friday and could arrive here this afternoon shoreside spokeswoman 
sylvia wilkerson said cautioning it could be sunday 
the threeman crew was very tired after being forced into 
repeated tacks wilkerson said at san franciscos st francis yacht 
club 
the crew and a host of enthusiasts had hoped the boat would break 
the previous record by 10 days by arriving friday 
if the 60foot yacht arrives sunday it would be eight days ahead 
of the clipper ship flying clouds 89day eighthour record for the 
14500mile passage set in 1854 thursdays child left new york on 
nov 23 
chief shoreside coordinator tony lush took a philosophical view 
of the delay part of being a sailor is taking what the wind gods 
will allow he said we will take what we can get 
she is pure sailboat absolutely at the mercy of the wind 
lush added noting that thursdays child has no engine 
the delay however could make the yachts entry through the 
golden gate ever more spectacular 
a flotilla estimated at 50 to 60 boats was waiting to greet 
thursdays child on friday but if it arrived over the weekend there 
could be hundreds in the gala fleet the coast guard plans to have 
cutters in the bay to prevent watery chaos

an air force plane today brought to italy 
the first bodies of italian tourists killed in the crash of a 
caribbeanbound us charter plane in the azores 
none of the 144 people believed aboard the illfated boeing 707 
survived wednesdays crash 
the 15 coffins were taken off the hercules c130 aircraft at 
bergamo airport where the jetliner of the smyrna tennbased 
independent air corp took off 
a second group of about 50 bodies were scheduled to arrive in 
italy late today or sunday according to carla bisegna a foreign 
ministry spokesman 
at belgamo airport a red cross worker stood by as a man knelt 
down placed a hand on a carved wooden casket and burst into tears 
a priest blessed the coffins some of which carried name tags 
with question marks next to the names authorities said some victims 
were only tentatively identified 
the charter flight which carried a crew of seven americans was 
bound for a resort in the dominican republic it was about to make a 
refueling stop in the azores a portuguese island chain in the 
western atlantic when it slammed into a fogcovered mountain 
authorities are investigating the cause of the crash 
they have said 137 italians were aboard 
italian media today however quoted the italian ambassador to 
portugal as saying there appears to have been more passengers on the 
plane than previously believed 
on that plane there was a lot more people than what we knew 
how and why will be difficult to understand ambassador giovanni 
battistini was quoted as saying by la repubblica newspaper in rome 
he did not elaborate 
state television reported five passports had been found that did 
not belong to any of the passengers on the flight manifest raising 
suspicions perhaps there were some lastminute passengers

the government today banned all 
protest meetings intended to show solidarity with an estimated 300 
black detainees waging a hunger strike to protest being held without 
charge 
the banning order specifically prohibited a protest meeting 
scheduled this afternoon at a johannesburg church by civil rights 
lawyers who represent many of the hunger strikers 
the detainees aid center a human rights group said today that 
two more hunger strikers had been taken to hillbrow hospital in 
johannesburg bringing to 13 the number hospitalized this week 
it said the two were admitted friday but the hospitalization 
only became known today after their parents visited them three 
others were admitted friday 
about 300 of an estimated 1000 people detained without charge 
are participating in the strike which began jan 23 at diepkloof 
prison outside johannesburg and has spread to at least three other 
cities 
the center said another striker mark modiba hospitalized 
wednesday was suffering from prerenal failure a serious kidney 
disorder 
the banning order signed by police commissioner hennie de witt 
also outlawed all other gatherings protesting against detentions or 
expressing support for detainees 
the banning is the act of frightened little men who fondly hope 
that the problem will now go away said the human rights 
commission formed by antiapartheid activists last year 
more than 40 johannesburg lawyers started a 48hour fast thursday 
in solidarity with the detainees the rally banned today was to mark 
the end of the fast 
many of the lawyers gathered at johannesburgs central methodist 
church at 1 pm the scheduled start of the meeting to advise 
wouldbe participants that it had been banned several dozen members 
of the police riot squad watched from vehicles and a police video 
unit filmed lawyers as they spoke with journalists outside the 
church 
the fact that the government sees fit to ban this meeting 
called by lawyers to discuss problems faced by their clients goes 
very far down the road towards the destruction of the rule of law in 
south africa said jules browde a prominent defense attorney 
the strike represents probably the strongest challenge to the 
policy of detention without trial since president pw botha 
declared a national state of emergency in june 1986 
the stateofemergency regulations restrict reporting about 
unrest security force actions treatment of detainees some forms 
of protest and statements the government considers subversive 
on friday he rev allan boesak said he and anglican archbishop 
desmond tutu would consider joining the hunger strike 
some of the detainees have been held the entire 32month state of 
emergency during which an estimated 30000 people have been held 
without charge for varying lengths of time 
the emergency regulations have paralyzed the legal system 
because detainees cannot challenge their detention in court 
boesak said they have had to use this extreme method to draw 
attention to their plight 
the government charged the strike was planned by outside groups 
and that some detainees had been forced to join it 
it is clear the strike is being orchestrated from outside 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said in parliament 
it is not spontaneous but carefully planned worldwide by these 
organizations vlok said without referring to any groups by name 
most of the detainees taking part do not share the enthusiasm of 
these organizations 
vlok said the government chose not to charge the detainees 
because of the difficulty obtaining convictions 
the human rights commission said vloks claim of outside 
instigation was not only ludicrous in the extreme but an insult to 
the commitment and courage of these prisoners of apartheid 
support from the outside they certainly do have no less than 
the support of the entire world that rejects the evil system of 
apartheid and its instruments of repression the commission said

a judge set strict conditions for a defendant 
in the mcmartin preschool child molestation case who is about to be 
freed after five years beyind bars without a conviction 
superior court judge william pounders delayed the release of 
raymond buckey until some paperwork is completed but told him 
friday that he would have to stay away from defendants in the case 
and all youngsters under 14 
the judge also told buckey that he would be forbidden to return 
to the manhattan beach area where he was reared and where the 
familyrun preschool operated 
if you fail to return for trial the trial will take place in 
your absence the judge warned he said friends of buckeys who 
posted their property to support the 15 million bail would lose 
their real estate if he failed to appear 
attorneys said buckey who had been scheduled for release friday 
probably wont be freed until late next week 
deputy district attorney lael rubin who has objected strenuously 
to the defendants release said she is satisfied with the 
conditions set by the judge particularly those barring him from 
contact with young children 
buckey 30 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 61 are being 
tried on 65 molestation and conspiracy counts involving 11 children 
buckey alone is named in 52 of the charges 
he is the only one of seven original defendants who has been held 
in prison while the case crawled through the courts 
the mcmartin case burst into the national media spotlight in 1983 
with lurid tales of mass sexual abuse devilish rituals death 
threats and animal mutilations hundreds of children were said to be 
involved 
but at the end of an 18month preliminary hearing charges were 
dismissed against five teachers when the district attorney concluded 
there was insufficient evidence to prosecute them

astronaut 
i love the person i thought i was married to she said

east boston district court was continued to feb 15 after a request 
for reduced bail was denied hunts attorney james cipoletta could 
not be reached friday but he has said he urged his client not to 
speak to the news media 
investigators compiling the story of hunts alleged stories say 
that for the past eight years he has been fooling many people in 
imaginative ways in massachusetts florida pennsylvania and 
ireland 
montour pa township police chief robert lighow said hunt 
allegedly rode around pennsylvania in a limousine seeking models for 
his baby powder while pretending to be a powder maker he said 
friday that he was investigating charges that hunt swindled his 
third wife a local woman out of large amounts of money he would 
not elaborate authorities say hunt is believed to have been married

shilling but politely said nothing others were completely taken 
in

assorted military paraphernalia flight jumpsuits and a helmet 
bearing the insignia of the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
dr park dietz a forensic psychiatrist who is an fbi consultant 
and a professor at the university of virginia said there are cases 
in legal circles falling under the category of the socalled 
impostor phenomenon 
its generally believed that people who are able to dupe others 
into believing that they have some professional status thats 
untrue most likely suffer from antisocial personality disorder 
said dietz who is on sabbatical in newport beach calif 
he said a recent national institute of mental health survey found 
about 5 percent of adult urba men and nearly 1 percent of adult 
urban women suffer from the disorder 
dietz said the ailment can be hereditary and that people who 
practice such deceptions tend not to have the same depth of 
emotions of empathy and warmth despite their charm 
why are so many duped 
it takes energy thought mental work to be skeptical about the 
myriad claims to legitimacy we come upon every day he said 
its easier to take people at their word particularly when it 
conveys some status by associating with them

a west german company today denied 
charges by a usbased jewish foundation that it provided chemicals 
for a libyan plant that us officials say is designed to make 
chemical weapons 
these allegations are categorically untrue said hansjoachim 
nimtz a spokesman for degussa ag of frankfurt 
the simon wiesenthal center located in los angeles accused 
degussa of supplying chemicals to the plant in rabta libya 
the united states has accused libya of building the factory to 
make chemical weapons libya has said the plant will manufacture 
pharmaceuticals 
degussa once owned 425 percent of the degesch company which 
manufactured the lethal gas used to exterminate jews interned at 
auschwitz during world war ii the simon wiesenthal center said 
it is incredible that degussa which as a major shareholder in 
degesch the company which produced zyklon b should once again 
contribute to a genocidal mission said rabbi daniel landes of the 
center on friday we urge the bonn government not to release these 
chemicals or any chemicals to libya which in any way can be turned 
into an agent for a new final solution 
he was referring to the nazi policy of killing jews 
nimtz said the company had delivered chemicals to a fertilizer 
factory in libya since 1983 but that it was more than 600 miles 
away from the disputed chemical plant 
referring to the wartime connection with degesch nimtz said 
not one degussa official was ever convicted of war crimes the 
degesch officials were executed 
customs officials on feb 3 temporarily halted a degussa chemical 
shipment to libya to determine whether export licenses were required 
nimtz said at the time that the chemical hexamethylene 
tetramine could not be used to produce poison gas and did not 
require an export permit 
he said today he expected the chemical to be released for 
shipment by next week 
we have always delivered this chemical straight to the libyan 
city of bengazi nimtz told the associated press in a telephone 
interview in the form we deliver it it can only be used to make 
fertilizer 
another company official who asked not to be identified said 
degussa delivers the same chemical to israel 
we have nothing to do with rabta and we are not the target of 
any criminal investigations in connection with it nimtz said

a luxury liner that sliced a cuban freighter in two 
leaving three crewmen missing and 13 injured returned to its home 
port today while officials asked why the smaller vessel didnt show 
up on the liners radar 
the cruise ship celebrations crew said there was no way to avoid 
slamming into the cargo ship which was drifting without lights off 
the cuban coast before dawn friday said carnival cruise lines vice 
president robert dickinson 
it was not seen on radar thats a mystery at this point 
dickinson said navigation lights on the cuban freighter capitan san 
luis went on only when the two ships were very close he said 
the 734foot celebrations officers tried to reverse course but 
it was too late for the 350foot cement hauler according to 
dickinson 
the miamibased cruise ship suffered minor damage and none of its 
1500 passengers and 600 crew members was injured he said 
a large black scrape was visible on the port side from the water 
line to the tip of the bow when the celebration approached its dock 
at the port of miami today but carnival spokesman tim gallagher 
said it looked worse than it was 
accident investigations were planned by the cruise line and its 
insurer lloyds of london as well as the national transportation 
safety board which has conducted a series of hearings in miami on 
cruise line safety 
a team from the coast guards marine safety office also planned 
to inspect the cruise ship coast guard petty officer brian lincoln 
said today gallagher was confident the ship would clear that 
inspection and sail again as scheduled at 4 pm on another weeklong 
cruise 
ntsb officials said they also wanted to look into the incident 
even though it involved a liberianregistered cruise liner and a 
cuban freighter en route from havana to the canary islands 
we dont have jurisdiction but we are expecting that carnival 
cruise lines will grant us permission to go aboard when the ship 
arrives ntsb spokesman michael benson said in washington we 
want to look at the ship and talk in particular to the crew on the 
bridge at the time 
two lifeboat crews from the celebration rescued 42 of the 45 
cuban crew members including one whose foot was severed the coast 
guard said 
a cuban navy frigate and tug picked up the rescued crew members 
who were being treated at cubas comandante pedro sotto alba

velazco morales 34 antonio campos de los reyes 41 and ivan 
freyre diaz 40 all of havana prensa latina reported

a communist party spokesman indicated 
today that party leaders have rejected a politburo reformers 
reassessment of the 1956 revolt as a popular uprising 
spokesman emil kimmel told hungarian radio that speakers at a 
crucial friday session of the 108member central committee said 
there should be no singleword summary formulations to reassess 
the past 
politburo member imre pozsgay startled the nation jan 28 by 
saying the 1956 rebellion against soviet control was a popular 
uprising officially it was called a counterrevolution 
the meeting resumed today with the media reporting few specifics 
pozsgay said his assessment was based on findings of a hungarian 
communist party commission investigating four decades of communist 
rule in hungary 
prominent central committee member gyula horn also state 
secretary at the foreign ministry hinted late friday that pozsgays 
stance was not accepted by most members 
varying only slightly from the official stance horn said on 
television that the meetings very careful assessment showed the 
revolt started as an uprising some may call it a popular 
uprising but later on it turned into something which could be 
termed a counterrevolution 
state media displayed none of their new openness in reporting on 
fridays closeddoor session it was not known what was said by 
pozsgay and other senior officials 
kimmel told a hungarian radio reporter that almost half the 
central committee members will have spoken by the time the session 
ends probably late this evening 
according to kimmel the speakers supported the basic idea 
expounded in a report submitted by communist party chief karoly 
grosz which says one can establish order without a reform but 
the reform may not be instituted without order 
he also said grosz called for an action program for the future 
grosz speech has not been published and no other details were 
disclosed 
the revolt began oct 23 1956 with demonstrations for a new 
government and demands that soviet troops leave hungary about 
20000 soviet troops entered budapest to quell the uprising on nov 
4 and janos kadar was elevated to power grosz replaced him last 
year 
before the session communist leaders appeared split not only 
over the 1956 events but also over the pace and extent of reforms 
they were also disagreeing over introduction of a multiparty system 
demanded by hungarys mushrooming independent political groups 
both grosz and other top party men went on record as disagreeing 
with pozsgays challenge to the official view of a counterrevolution 
crushed by soviet tanks 
his statement opened up public differences with other party 
leaders and an unprecedented debate in the state press and society 
about the events 
the bloody end of the rebellion is a highly emotional issue for 
hungarians and the communist party is under pressure to revise its 
view 
alternative political movements that have sprung up in recent 
months say they will not enter a coalition with the communists as 
some party reformers want if the party does not change its stand on 
1956

doctors today completed an abortion on a 
comatose woman whose husband had battled antiabortion activists to 
the us supreme court to become her guardian 
its been a major battle i am tired and wounded i want to go 
on with my life martin klein said after the abortion was 
performed on his wife nancy 32 no other family should ever have 
to go through what we have gone through 
mrs klein who was 18 weeks pregnant has been at north shore 
university hospital since a dec 13 car accident left her comatose 
hospital spokeswoman carol hauptman at 940 am announced that the 
abortion had been completed 
we are extremely relieved that the court battle is over and the 
operation went smoothly said anne zusselman mrs kleins mother 
now we are hopeful that nancys condition will improve and that we 
can move on to therapy for her 
klein later thanked people who had supported his efforts about a 
halfdozen prochoice activists carried placards outside the 
hospital this morning 
klein of upper brookville sought guardianship of his 
braindamaged wife on jan 26 so he could authorize the abortion 
that doctors said might save her life a judge granted his request 
but the activists blocked the abortion at each court level until 
us supreme court justice thurgood marshall on friday turned down 
their request for a stay of the lower court ruling declaring klein 
his wifes guardian 
tough battle but we won it klein said friday by telephone 
from his home in upper brookville on long island we can now turn 
our attention to trying to help nancy 
john short a farmingdale antiabortion activist who had helped 
block kleins guardianship also had asked conservative supreme 
court justice antonin scalia to intervene because they are 
criminally assaulting her and killing her child 
around 6 pm friday doctors gave mrs klein medication that is 
routinely administered about 12 hours before a secondtrimester 
abortion is performed ms hauptman said 
she said it was unclear what effect the abortion would have on 
mrs klein 
in her condition puncturing a pimple is dangerous ms 
hauptman said shes in guarded condition and the status of her 
life neurologically is very precarious its terrible really 
really tragic 
outside the hospital friday a lone antiabortion protester 
carrying baby clothing and clutching a rosary and cross was arrested 
for trespass after he lay down in front of the front door ms 
hauptman and police said he refused to give his name to authorities 
on thursday appellate division judges said that previous new 
york state court decisions had established that strangers will not 
be appointed legal guardians unless no one in the family can serve 
in that role 
klein was fully capable of handling his wifes affairs the 
lower state appeals court said 
the next day the seven judges of the new york court of appeals 
in albany the states highest court declined to review the 
original decision by judge bernard mccaffrey that named klein 
guardian of his pregnant wife 
the antiabortion activists short and john broderick were 
rebuffed again when marshall who has jurisdiction over new york 
turned down their request for a stay without comment 
short said they would attempt to continue the case so questions 
raised by the case can be resolved 
mrs kleins father frederick zusselman expressed relief but 
said the cases tragic circumstances made the legal victory 
bittersweet 
life will never be the same zusselman said this has been 
such a horrendous ordeal i hope no one will ever have to experience 
what we have 
were really torn apart weve been up and down on a roller 
coaster these people short and broderick have put us through 
absolute hell he added 
zusselman and his wife anne live in delray beach fla but 
have been staying with their 34yearold soninlaw during the court 
battle and support his decision to seek an abortion the kleins have 
a 3yearold child 
klein said that after learning at the hospital of marshalls 
decision i told nancy that everything was going to be fine i 
gave her a kiss and came home

an afghan guerrilla spokesman said 
today that a meeting to form a postwar islamic government for his 
homeland will reconvene but others said deep divisions threaten the 
process 
the 526 delegates who gathered friday to attend the meeting 
included guerrillas scholars and ministers from previous afghan 
governments 
but the meeting was adjourned indefinitely after iranianbased 
guerrillas walked out in a dispute over representation at the 
meeting and on a supreme council of guerrilla leaders 
the supreme council would make many daytoday decisions in the 
postwar afghan government 
rasul sayyaf spokesman for the gathering told a news conference 
in the pakistan capital that the meeting would resume but that he 
could not say when 
sayyaf played down divisions in the quarrelsome alliance of seven 
pakistanibased insurgent groups 
but guerrilla sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the factions were deeply divided over the composition of a postwar 
government and the role the eight iranianbased insurgent groups 
would play 
earlier this month sibghatullah mojaddidi chairman of the 
pakistan alliance offered the iranianbased groups 100 delegates to 
the meeting and six seats on the supreme council 
he was overruled by the pakistan alliances four extremist 
parties said ghulam waziri political officer of mojaddidis 
moderate afghan national liberation front 
sayyaf said the last offer to the iranian alliance was 102 
delegates to the meeting of which 42 would be chosen by the 
pakistani alliance there was no offer of seats on the supreme 
council 
the iranian alliance also rejected that offer 
mohammad karim khalili chairman of the iranian alliance said 
earlier today his delegation was returning to tehran 
the guerrillas based in iran belong to afghanistans minority 
shiite sect of islam 
the pakistanibased insurgents are sunni moslems and so are about 
80 percent of afghanistans 15 million people 
officials of moderate guerrilla groups based in pakistan said 
they feared hardline islamic radicals would try to dominate a 
postwar government 
we dont want an extremistdominated government to be there 
said azim nasserzia spokesman for the moderate national islamic 
front of afghanistan 
one thing the guerrilla groups agree on is that the communist 
government in afghanistan will fall after the soviets complete their 
troop withdrawal expected by wednesday under an accord mediated by 
the united nations 
the soviets sent troops to afghanistan in 1979 to prop up the 
marxist government about 115000 soldiers were stationed there when 
the red army began its pullout in may

saturday for her first official trip abroad and gave assurances that 
china long a close ally of her country will remain a cornerstone 
of pakistans foreign policy 
ms bhutto speaking at a banquet put on by premier li peng said 
her visit had special significance in that she was fulfilling a 
promise made after her election in november to make china her first 
foreign stop 
this demonstrates that the democratic government attaches 
special importance and priority to pakistans timetested relations 
with china she said 
ms bhutto received a boisterous welcome from about 200 pakistani 
diplomats residents and schoolchildren at the airport 
she broke with normal procedure walking away from a waiting 
limousine to shake hands with the pakistanis many shouted her name 
and waved banners in english arabic and chinese reading long live 
benazir bhutto and long live sinopakistan friendship 
the pakistani leader will spend three days in china in addition 
to li she plans to meet with senior leader deng xiaoping and the 
general secretary of the communist party zhao ziyang 
the official xinhua news agency said afghanistan will be the main 
focus of talks but another topic is expected to be chinese arms 
sales to pakistan the muslim newspaper in islamabad reported 
saturday that pakistan had reached agreement with china to purchase 
75 f7 jets a chinese version of the mig21 at a cost of about 
225 million 
china is second only to the united states in providing military 
equipment to pakistan and is now helping pakistan develop its 
nuclear industry both pakistan and china have denied persistent 
reports the nuclear aid has military applications 
ms bhutto in her banquet remarks recalled how her father the 
late prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto made his first foreign trip 
to china in 1972

for a month in 1972 when she was a student in the united states

which generally has knitted closely with that of china 
pakistan was glad to see prospects of improved relations between 
china and india following indian prime minister rajiv gandhis visit 
to beijing in december ms bhutto said she said her recent talks 
with the indian leader also helped to remove some of the mistrust 
that has bedeviled the pakindia relationship

and the soviet union to culminate with soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachevs visit to beijing in may it will be the first 
sinosoviet summit in 30 years 
we believe that the reduction of tension and resolution of 
outstanding issues between the two great neighbors will be conducive 
to peace and stability in our region she said 
china and pakistan with common adversaries in india and the 
soviet union have been very close since pakistan became one of the 
first countries to recognize the communist government in beijing 
after it was established in 1949 
china had close relations with ms bhuttos predecessor mohammed 
zia ulhaq under whose rule ms bhuttos father was arrested and 
executed in 1979 but beijing was quick to support ms bhutto after 
she was elected to succeed zia who died in a suspicious plane crash 
in august

welcoming ceremony inside the great hall of the people 
on sunday ms bhutto is to hold talks with li and meet party

published reports today said that defense 
secretarydesignate john towers congressional testimony about his 
work for british aerospace inc contradicts an earlier sworn 
statement the nominee has made about his relationship with the firm 
the reports in the los angeles times and the legal times raised 
new questions about towers ties to defense contractors one of 
several areas that have held up confirmation of president bushs 
choice as secretary of defense 
the publications said tower has said he advised the british firm 
on selling military systems to the us even though he testified to 
the senate armed services committee that his work for british 
aerospace concerned only nonmilitary matters 
meantime the new york post reported today that the fbi 
apparently has not bothered to talk to towers neighbors examine 
certain police records or investigate several car accidents 
involving tower 
the post citing syndicated columnist cody shearer said the 
incidents included an episode on june 6 1967 when tower was trapped 
in his hotel suite in dallas by an earlymorning blaze he 
accidentally set by dropping a cigarette on an overstuffed armchair 
when firemen broke into his room to remove him he was 
reportedly in no condition to free himself the post said 
in written testimony tower told the armed services committee he 
could recall no actions in connection with any defense 
activities that he had done for the us subsidiary of british 
aerospace 
tower told the committee which has suspended consideration of 
his nomination until after the current congressional recess that he 
worked chiefly on selling commercial jets to us airlines and also 
advised british aerospace on trade legislation and currency 
fluctuations 
but in a sworn deposition in june 1987 tower said he had given 
the company advice on selling certain systems to the defense 
department according to the los angeles times 
the statement was given in a deposition to lawyers representing 
towers second wife in their divorce proceeding the publications 
reported 
tower said in the deposition that he advised the company on how 
to sell training jets fighter planes and missile systems to the 
pentagon according to the los angeles times 
legal times reported that tower earned 265000 from british 
aerospace june 1986 until last december 
white house spokesman stephen hart with bush in kennebunkport 
maine said today when asked about the los angeles times and legal 
times reports we have no information on that its the issue of 
towers nomination before the committee we wont comment on that 
the reports came as the white house moved friday to refute 
allegations concerning towers use of alcohol 
the doctor who performed surgery on defense secretarydesignate 
john tower last month released a statement saying he found no 
medical evidence that the nominee abuses alcohol 
dr rd dignan a colorectal surgeon at baylor university 
medical center said tower underwent an extensive medical 
evaluation including a complete blood chemistry analysis and an 
abdominal cat scan prior to his jan 5 operation to remove a polyp 
in his colon 
all tests and examinations that senator tower underwent 
indicated no abnormalities within organ systems that might be 
involved with alcohol abuse dr dignan said in a statement 
released in dallas from a medical standpoint we dont have any 
evidence that senator tower abuses alcohol 
after the surgery dignan discussed with tower his postoperative 
recuperation and diet 
i advised the senator that his normal limit of one or two 
glasses of wine with dinner was medically acceptable dignan said 
meanwhile the chairman of the senate armed services committee 
sen sam nunn dga said he still has continuing questions 
overall about the tower nomination including questions about 
towers alcohol use the 63yearold former senator says he drinks 
only modestly usually a little wine 
nunn said the committee has received medical information from 
towers doctors but the panel has done nothing with that except 
read it 
we made no decision about what to do with it he said 
nunn and the ranking republican on the committee sen john 
warner of virginia also said friday that final action on the 
nomination is likely when congress returns feb 21 from its weeklong 
recess the action however depends on the results of the ongoing 
fbi investigation 
were not saying any kind of deadline but it is certainly my 
hope that the week we get back the committee will take a final 
action on this nomination nunn said after he and warner met with 
white house counsel c boyden gray 
nunn said he was unaware of any new allegations against tower and 
he dismissed suggestions of security breaches by the nominee while 
he served as a us armscontrol negotiator in geneva 
weve found nothing on that he said 
senators have said the fbi is checking any links between tower 
and defense contractors named in operation ill wind the 
codename for the federal investigation of alleged corruption in the 
pentagons procurement system 
records on file at the federal election commission show that 
tower received campaign contributions for his 1984 election race 
from at least two men who have been named in federal affidavits 
released in the ill wind case 
tower who opted not to run in 1984 received a 500 campaign 
contribution from charles f gardner a retired unisys corp 
employee he also received 1000 from thomas muldoon a 
washingtonbased consultant neither has been charged in the 
pentagon case 
both donations were within the 1000 limit for individual 
contributions 
tower also received a legal contribution of 500 from the sperry 
corp political action committee as did warner when he ran for 
reelection in 1984 under federal election law the sperry pac 
could have given up to 10000 to any candidate for the primary and 
general election 
sperry merged with the burroughs corp in 1986 to become unisys 
corp 
abc news reported friday that tower in his meeting with nunn and 
warner said he was unaware of the campaign contributions and denied 
allegations that he had a drinking problem 
meanwhile the los angeles times and legal times reported that 
fbi director william sessions has removed himself from any 
involvement in the tower probe fbi spokesman gregory jones refused

a jet fighter of the nationalist chinese air force 
crashed in a rice paddy in communist china today after it ran out of 
oil but the pilot parachuted to safety official reports said 
in taiwan a relative of the pilot said he believed the officer 
had defected to china to see his grandmother in the southeastern 
province of guangdong 
but an official at the canton office of the staterun radio said 
government officials did not believe the pilot identified as lin 
xianshun 35 had defected 
we believe he lost his way in the fog said the official who 
would only identify himself as wang he now is in the hospital in 
canton with minor injuries 
the radio official said provincial officials will meet sunday to 
discuss lins repatriation if he is not a defector 
air force officials in taiwan said the f5e jet fighter lost 
contact with a radio tower at chihang air base 180 miles southest 
of taipei about 10 minutes after taking off on a training flight 
the canton radio official said the plane crashed in a rice paddy 
in fengshun county about 180 miles north of canton the provincial 
capital of guangdong province 
he said it was not clear whether there were any casualties on the 
ground 
the xinhua news agency said the plane was mangled in the crash 
a relative of lin speaking on condition of anonymity from 
miaoli about 30 miles south of taipei said he believed the pilot 
had defected because lin had complained about the ban on military 
personnel visiting china 
in 1987 the nationalist government in taiwan eased the ban to 
allow all taiwanese except military personnel and government 
employees to visit china 
more than a dozen nationalist air force officers have sought 
asylum in china since 1949 when the nationalists fled to taiwan 
after losing a civil war with communist forces on the mainland 
the latest was li dawei who defected in 1983 in a trainer plane 
li received 40000 from the chinese government and use of a 
chauffered limousine 
china late last year abolished the system of rewards for 
taiwanese military defectors 
military officials in taiwan said 19 military personnel have 
defected from china to taiwan since 1949 
china regards taiwan as a renegade province and the two are 
technically at war

say what you will it about the savings and loan 
crisis it has done wonders for the ampersand 
vaguely old fashioned the ampersand that curly little symbol 
that stands for and seemed to be in a decline until the 
financial difficulties of the sampl industry put it on every front 
page for some reason sampls are always abbreviated with an 
ampersand just as superbowls are numbered with roman numerals 
like everything else the ampersand has a history according to 
robert hendrickson who wrote the encyclopedia of word and phrase 
origins it was invented by marcus tiro a freed slave and secretary 
to cicero a roman statesman orator and author 
tiros job was taking down ciceros dictation cicero talked 
fast so tiro created the first known system of shorthand including 
the ampersand tiros tironian notes saw wide use in europe for 
nearly a thousand years 
the amp itself was just a quick way of writing et which means 
and in latin the name ampersand is a corruption of the term 
and per se and which means as follows 
the harper dictionary of contemporary usage by william morris and 
mary morris laments the tendency of corporations to go modern and 
abandon their ampersands 
the morrises note that the ad firm of batten barton durstin amp 
osborne switched to simply batten barton durstin osborne 
dropping the ampersand and losing part of the charm which led 
heywood broun to say that the corporate name sounded to him like a 
beer barrel rolling down a flight of steps 
in any event the morrises getting down to business decree that 
the ampersand is to be avoided in writing of formal or semiformal 
nature save for the most impromptu personal notes 
however the ampersand may be staging a corporate comeback even 
without the sampl crisis spur of conspicuousness says rick bragdon 
senior vice president in the san francisco firm which does name 
development for companies changing their images 
he said after stiff debate during a yearlong identity program 
for pacific gas and electric it was decided to abandon the and 
in pg and e its old symbol in favor of pgampe 
we had to resolve once and for all how to represent and 
bragdon said 
there were a whole variety of constituencies lots of people 
wanted and and others wanted the ampersand and some thought a very 
discrete plus sign would be modern and hip we advocated the 
ampersand as an inalienable part of the name a beautiful stylized 
ampersand 
however to show how shortlived these victories are bragdon 
said his own firm has changed its name abandoning an ampersand in 
the process it used to be sampo consultants 
the final decision was to go with addison design consultants 
over the objections of founder and chairman bob ohrenschalls in the 
old days he was the fellow behind the amp

president ali khamenei today told a huge 
outdoor rally celebrating the 10year revolution that irans leaders 
are disagreeing but remain committed to their revolutionary 
ideas 
this is natural all over the world but there are no 
disagreements over the basic policy and objectives of the 
revolution khamenei said in an address to a crowded square from a 
platform draped in blue and green our revolutionary ideas have 
not changed 
hardliners and moderates in the regime are battling over how far 
iran should develop relations with the outside world after years of 
selfimposed isolation 
khamenei said iran is willing to cooperate with any country to 
help rebuild the economy battered in an eightyear war with iraq as 
long as the country giving the aid doesnt try to dominate us 
according to police between 3 million and 4 million people 
attended the rally climaxing 10 days of celebrations for the 10th 
anniversary of the overthrow of the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
and founding of an islamic state by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
a 10story high portrait of khomeini suspended from a crane 
overlooked the square but the 88yearold revolutionary patriarch 
now in frail health was not present he rarely leaves his tehran 
residence 
three choirs of children wearing headbands saying happy and 
blessed is the next decade sang the national anthem a squadron 
of military helicopters dropped leaflets calling for unity in the 
the postwar reconstruction 
the official islamic republic news agency reported the crowd 
included 230 political prisoners freed today under a general 
amnesty it said most were released from tehrans evin jail where 
they were being held under sentence of death or life imprisonment 
the agency did not say for what offenses the prisoners were jailed 
security at the rally was tight with guards armed with automatic 
weapons patrolling and searching foreign reporters 
after coming through hardships and battles today we feel much 
stronger said khamenei despite what he called plotting by 
world oppressor powers a reference to the united states he said 
iran wants friendly ties with all countries except the united 
states and israel 
the crowd listened quietly but shouted death to america in 
english and waved clenched fists when official cheerleader ali 
montazadi led chanting in a booming baritone 
as snow started falling at the end of the rally montazadi known 
to iranians as minister of slogans started a new chant of 
islam is best 
many attending traveled through the night for final events of the 
celebrations 
this is a big day for iran and we want to show the imam 
khomeini our love and support for the revolution explained 
mohammad isfahani a whitebearded man who said he lost two sons in 
the iraniraq war 
no sacrifice is enough in serving god he said 
officials said similar rallies were being held across the country 
to commemorate the overthrow of the 2500yearold monarchy 
the celebrations take place amid increased public debate and 
criticism of the clergydominated government 
unfortunately instead of safeguarding the values of the 
revolution we shouted slogans instead of keeping the people 
involved we isolated the intelligent and active forces making them 
more and more disgruntled ayatollah husseinali montazeri 
khomeinis designated successor said in an interview this week with 
the newspaper abrar 
this years colorful celebrations marked by fireworks and 
floodlit buildings contrast sharply with previous years during the 
grueling war with iraq 
a unsponsored ceasefire took effect aug 20 in the war which 
took the lives of 1 million iranians and iraqis

afghan shiite moslem guerrillas 
supported by iran are demanding a major voice in the future of 
afghanistan despite opposition from more powerful rival sunni 
guerrilla groups 
irans revolutionary shiite government wants to use the afghan 
shiites to exert influence in neighboring afghanistan and try to 
block the influence of the united states and pakistan according to 
afghan analysts 
iran wants to play the shiite card in afghanistan said a 
senior independent guerrilla official who declined to be named 
the united states and pakistan have backed the pakistanbased 
sunni groups who have been battling the afghan government nearly a 
decade 
shiite guerrilla leaders pulled out friday from a meeting of 
afghan guerrilla leaders in islamabad which was held to try to 
form an interim government to replace afghanistans tottering 
communist regime 
sunni afghan guerrilla groups refused to recognize an earlier 
agreement to seat 100 shiite representatives at the council because 
they wanted to reduce the number of shiite delegates 
eight shiite afghan guerrilla organizations are based in iran 
but little is known about them the groups are armed supplied and 
trained by iran and appear to be under iranian control 
seven sunni afghan guerrilla groups are based in pakistan with 
headquarters in the frontier city of peshawar but the much larger 
sunni groups are not based primarily on religious loyalties 
occasional reports of friction and clashes between sunni and 
shiite guerrillas have come out of afghanistan 
iranian revolutionary guards reportedly have operated at times in 
shiite areas of afghanistan aiding the iranianbased guerrillas 
against conservative shiites who oppose tehrans revolutionary 
fundamentalism 
mohammad karim khalili chairman of the alliance of the iranian 
based groups said the groups are not primarily promoted by shiite 
loyalties despite their religious base the shiite groups he said 
are only seeking equal rights for all religious and ethnic groups 
and an end to discrimination they suffered in the past 
we want an islamic government in afghanistan it must be 
independent and it must be nonaligned he said in an interview 
with the associated press 
shiites were discriminated against by past sunnidominated afghan 
governments before the communists seized power in 1978 shiites were 
banned from the armed forces most government posts and had limited 
educational and career opportunities according to afghan exiles 
khalili said about 30 percent of afghans are shiites but most 
estimates put the number of shiites at about 15 percent with sunnis 
making up about 80 percent of the population 
shiite guerrilla groups have played a comparatively small role in 
the decadelong war against the afghan communist government and 
soviet forces that supported the regime according to most afghan 
analysts 
there are no reliable figures on the fighting strength of the 
various sunni and shiite guerrilla groups estimates indicate sunni 
fighters outnumber shiite guerrillas 10to1 
khalili said he could not provide any figures on the number of 
fighters the shiites can field but said their forces had occupied 
large areas of afghanistan 
some of the pakistanibased sunni guerrilla groups operate from 
iran into afghanistan but their leaders complain that the iranians 
obstruct operations and limit or delay supplies other sunni groups 
pulled out of iran or refused to operate there because of frequent 
problems 
khalili denied charges the shiite groups are influenced by iran 
saying they had simply received aid from the iranians 
we are from afghanistan we are afghani we will never accept 
interference in our affairs from any country he said 
iran has little chance of exporting its revolutionary brand of 
fundamentalism to conservative sunnidominated afghanistan said 
naim majrooh head of the afghan information center which monitors 
events in afghanistan 
but the sunni guerrilla groups are deeply divided over sharing 
power political aims and other issues and their alliance has been 
able to agree on very little 
even a relatively small force such as the shiite guerrillas could 
promote iranian interests in the confusion likely to follow the 
expected fall of the communist regime some analysts say 
in a divided afghanistan a trained and well armed force loyal 
to iran could be very useful to the iranians majrooh said

human rights activists saturday 
threatened defiance and warned of rising black anger after police 
banned meetings intended to support a hunger strike by 300 blacks 
detained without charge 
some of the strikers have gone 20 days without food and lawyers 
say 13 have been hospitalized a support committee said many were in 
danger of dying or suffering irreparable physical damage 
the ban specifically prohibited a protest meeting scheduled 
saturday at a johannesburg church by civil rights lawyers who 
represent strikers 
the order signed by police commissioner hennie de witt also 
outlawed all other gatherings protesting detentions or expressing 
support for detainees 
the banning is the act of frightened little men who fondly hope 
that the problem will now go away said the human rights 
commission formed by antiapartheid activists last year 
the hunger strikers support committee a coalition established 
last week said the ban will not prevent public expressions of 
solidarity with detainees the issue is far too serious 
the governments intransigence will only exacerbate the already 
widespread feelings of anger and alienation in the black 
community the committee said 
more than 40 johannesburg lawyers started a 48hour fast thursday 
in solidarity with the detainees they had planned to end the fast 
at saturdays meeting 
many of the lawyers gathered at johannesburgs central methodist 
church at 1 pm the scheduled start of the meeting to advise 
wouldbe participants it had been banned several dozen riot police 
watched from vehicles and a police video unit filmed lawyers as 
they spoke with journalists outside the church 
the fact that the government sees fit to ban this meeting 
called by lawyers to discuss problems faced by their clients goes 
very far down the road toward the destruction of the rule of law in 
south africa said jules browde a prominent defense attorney 
about 300 of an estimated 1000 people detained without charge 
have joined the strike which began jan 23 at diepkloof prison 
outside johannesburg and spread to at least three other cities 
the strike is widely viewed as the most serious challenge to the 
policy of indefinite detention without trial since the government 
declared a national state of emergency in june 1986 
some detainees have been held for the entire emergency during 
which an estimated 30000 people have been detained without charge 
for varying periods 
the government says it has not charged the detainees because of 
the difficulty obtaining convictions 
law and order minister adriaan vlok alleged friday the strike was 
planned by outside groups and that some detainees had been forced to 
join it 
the human rights commission said vloks allegation was not only 
ludicrous in the extreme but an insult to the commitment and courage 
of these prisoners of apartheid 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no voice 
in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate schools districts and health services

the family of a woman who gave birth while 
in a coma expressed support for antiabortion activists fighting a 
losing battle against a new york mans effort to have the operation 
performed on his comatose wife 
we should take whatever god has given us and thats the way it 
is said david blodgett sr whose daughterinlaw barbara 
blodgett was three months pregnant when she suffered a brain injury 
in an auto accident last june 
the 24yearold woman gave birth to a healthy boy simon on dec 
9 despite a gloomy prognosis she began to regain consciousness 
shortly after the birth and can now sit up in a wheelchair and hold 
a bottle to simons lips 
blodgett said he spoke friday with john broderick one of two 
antiabortion activists who challenged the request by martin klein 
of upper brookville ny that he be appointed guardian of his 
comatose wife nancy 
new york states highest court on friday refused to let broderick 
and john short intervene in the case us supreme court justice 
thurgood marshall subsequently rejected their request for a stay of 
state court rulings granting klein guardianship and doctors 
performed the abortion today 
mrs klein who was 18 weeks pregnant has been in a coma at a 
hospital in manhasset ny since an auto accident dec 13 and has 
been given only a slight chance of recovering klein said physicians 
advised him an abortion may save her life 
blodgett said he called mrs kleins mother thursday to offer 
information i told her what transpired with barbie he said 
i dont think taking the baby is going to be any benefit to the 
mother 
blodgett who opposes abortion said he was not able to talk with 
klein 
members of mrs blodgetts family point to her recovery as proof 
that doctors can be wrong in such cases 
they doctors were at one time telling us the same kind of 
thing said greg valenzuela mrs blodgetts father all we 
asked them to do is make the attempt to maintain both as best they 
could once they decided to do it it didnt seem like a major 
problem 
blodgett said his daughterinlaws life was also threatened by 
elevated body temperatures caused by the brain injury and that the 
antibiotics used to treat the fever were a threat to the fetus but 
there was never any serious consideration of trying to save one over 
the other he said

two days after the house voted by an 81 margin 
to bury a 51 percent congressional pay raise last week speaker jim 
wright was asked if he would consider a smaller increase 
that question has been answered he told reporters referring 
to the rejection vote i can count 
everyone wants to change the subject and move on said rep 
vic fazio dcalif who was a supporter of the raise it the pay 
raise battle left deep scars that wont be quickly healing theres 
a mutual frustration with each other 
such comments are not surprising in the aftermath of the 38048 
house vote and the 946 senate tally to reject a raise that 
brought howls of protest on talk shows across the nation as tired 
as lawmakers may be of the painful affair however at least some 
issues linked to it wont go away 
common cause the selfstyled citizens lobby says it will 
maintain pressure on congress to eliminate the outside income 
lawmakers receive from special interest groups 
this congress cannot long ignore the increasing call for 
ethical reform said fazio 
the senate voted two weeks ago to bar members from pocketing fees 
for speaking to various groups including special interest lobbies 
but it made the change contingent on approval of the pay raise 
the house had been planning to vote on the honoraria issue last 
thursday coupled with a plan by wright to scale the raise back to 
30 percent the issue went on the back burner tuesday when the 
house decided the public wouldnt stand for any raise 
its a major setback for reform said house majority whip 
tony coelho dcalif i thought what was needed was to increase 
salary do away with honoraria and start a reform movement here 
while house members are still eligible to keep 26850 in 
honoraria the question of outside fees has been bucked to a new 
bipartisan panel cochaired by fazio and rep lynn martin rill 
lawmakers say theres no chance the house or the senate where 
members can retain 35800 in honoraria will give up the system 
without a raise since that would amount to a pay cut 
still simmering is the issue of raises for judges and top federal 
executives 
congress rejection of its own increase prevented raises for 
1100 judges 834 top executive branch appointed officials 7000 
career federal managers 12000 foreign service officers and 155 
generals and admirals 
coelho told colleagues just before the rejection we are voting 
to continue the exodus of judges toplevel managers and yes 
creative members of congress from government service to the private 
sector 
lawmakers have shown little interest in resurrecting these pay 
raises without considering their own 
i dont think its a sound idea because of the branches being 
equal said rep patricia schroeder dcolo and chairman of the 
house post office civil service subcommittee the forefathers 
didnt say we should have a lower branch 
a survey by the administrative office of the us courts 
concluded 20 of the last 26 judges to leave the federal bench said 
pay was a factor in their resignations 
from 195873 six federal judges resigned from the lifetime 
position compared to 60 from 1974 to 1978 the loss in real salary 
due to inflation has totaled 30 percent for us judges since 1969 
the office said 
here are other unresolved issues from the pay raise dispute 
which the bipartisan house ethics panel may consider 
expenses members of congress invited to make a speech can wind 
up with a stay in a posh resort courtesy of special interests the 
panel must decide whether to follow the lead of bipartisan house 
negotiators whose illfated honoraria reform package would likely 
have placed time limits on trips for a single speech 
nonhonoraria income the house proposal would have limited all 
outside income to 15 percent of salary prohibited affiliation with 
business entities for compensation prevented members from 
practicing a profession except parttime teaching and banned 
members from serving as an officer or board member on a publicly 
held regulated corporation the prohibitions on business and 
professional affiliations are already in senate rules 
a separate wrightappointed panel on campaign finance reform will 
consider whether to eliminate the grandfather clause loophole in 
federal law 
the provision allows house members in office before 1980 to 
convert leftover campaign cash to personal use the house reform 
package would have ended this loophole in 1991 allowing any member 
holding leftover cash to retire with the money after this term 
but anyone running again would have limited options including 
giving to campaigns of others donating the money to charity or 
returning it to those who made the contributions

the rev barbara harris an episcopal priest from 
philadelphia today became the first female bishop in any major 
branch of christendom that traces it leadership back 2000 years to 
the time of christ 
harris was consecrated as suffragan or assistant episcopal 
bishop for the boston episcopal diocese a relatively obscure 
position that has drawn world attention because of her gender 
background and liberal views 
a large number of bishops attended the stately ceremony at hynes 
veteran memorial auditorium and 2000 clergy members lay leaders 
ecumenical representatives and civic dignitaries marched in 
procession 
the chief consecrator was the most rev edmond browning 
presiding bishop of the episcopal church in the united states 
just say im very proud and very happy thats all said 
harris mother beatrice harris 
this is something that people feel very right about very 
convicted about said the rev gerald porter an episcopal priest 
and the master of ceremony and we feel very blessed that we have 
been chosen to lead the church in new ways 
harris was greeted by a burst of applause as she walked down the 
aisle but there was some protest raised to the consecration 
john jamieson of evanston ill chairman of the conservative 
prayer book societys chicago chapter spoke during the time 
allotted for any protest 
bishop browning please weigh the consequences by proceeding 
with this pretended consecration you will perpetuate a sacrilegious 
imposture you will abandon the communion of all those churches 
descended from the church of england and you will destroy the 
concept of legality in the episcopal church jamieson said 
browning responded by saying that such objections had been raised 
in advance but that the consecration was in accordance with church 
laws the audience roared its approval and gave him a standing 
ovation 
the congregation thundered out its approval after browning asked 
is it your will that barbara be ordained a bishop 
harris became the first female bishop in a branch of christianity 
that believes in apostolic succession that its leaders are 
descended from christs apostles among such denominations are the 
roman catholic church eastern orthodox churches and the worldwide 
anglican communion which includes the episcopal church 
while her appointment was opposed by some religious leaders 
because of her gender harris has generated controversy for other 
reasons she is divorced lacks a college or seminary degree and is 
politically outspoken 
in her writings harris has not been shy about blasting 
conservatives in the church she has been designated to help lead 
in an article last april in a liberal church publication the 
witness the 58yearold priest took aim at the conservative church 
prayer book society and the groups plan to monitor votes by liberal 
clergy members at an episcopal convention 
her writings served to fan the controversy surrounding her 
election last september 
the rev jerome politzer of the conservative prayer book society 
put it bluntly friday a bishop is to be a disciple of jesus 
christ not karl marx her hardline leftist position is not a 
moderating reconciling position 
auburn traycik editor of the christian challenge a conservative 
episcopal publication said she objected more to the style than the 
content of harris writings 
a lot of her stuff shows a distinct lack of charity a kind of 
unseemliness traycik said the christian challenge published a 
lengthy article in december detailing some of what the papers 
editors believed were harris more objectionable writings 
among others the publication found unacceptable harris 
description of the prayer book society as divisive defiant 
deleterious and demonic 
but not all the targets of harris pointed pen take issue with 
her selection 
bishop alden hathaway of pittsburgh represents episcopalians 
united for renewal revelation and reformation referred to by 
harris as the new 3r bunch hathaway said he voted in support 
of harris election 
shell bring a very peppery perspective hathaway said im 
sure that in the house of bishops were going to be on the opposite 
sides of a lot of issues i have met her and i liked her i wish her

congress cut off military aid to nicaraguas 
rebels a year ago and the stranded guerrilla army is marking time 
at bases in honduras two ap journalists spent four days at contra 
camps here is a report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a year after the us congress cut off 
military aid to nicaraguan rebels the guerrilla army created with 
us assistance is stranded in an isolated mountain valley without 
the means to fight 
its men are keeping up their morale with intense training as they 
listen to the news on the radio and wonder what president bushs 
policy will be 
if the us doesnt help us well go back to the early days 
taking our guns from the piricuacos said contra fighter donal 
severano using camp slang meaning armed dogs for nicaraguas 
sandinista army 
far from contra directorate members in tegucigalpa or miami far 
from the policy considerations of washington the guerrillas are 
aware of what they call the situation that began when congress 
cut off military aid feb 3 1988 
contra troops began to move out of nicaragua as their supplies 
dwindled most of them withdrawing to their main base here along the 
yamales river about 10 miles inside honduras 
although they continue be optimistic about prospects for aid few 
do not know that bushs emphasis on bipartisanship and 
cooperation with the democratic majority in congress may be a death 
knell to hopes for renewal 
few appear disposed to quit 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega says we are a cadaver 
waiting to be buried well here are 11000 cadavers alive 
said comandante jackson a member of the general staff who doesnt 
use his real name for reasons of security and esprit de corps 
like many contras jackson takes heart from nicaraguas economic 
crash and the cuts the leftist sandinista government says it is 
making in its defense budget 
we can beat them even though they outnumber us because were 
tougher like wood they cant send draftees from the city after 
us said comandante caliman a battalion leader his two 
silverframed teeth flashing 
jackson and others said groups of rebels still infiltrate 
nicaragua despite a truce in effect since may but the scale of the 
fighting has been drastically reduced 
the contra encampment now spreads for seven miles along the 
yamales river and gets larger every day as more small groups emerge 
from the jungle 
the camps are organized by battalion although some are beginning 
to take on a settled look many have brought wives and children from 
the inside a few women work as prostitutes others have settled 
into rough wartime relationships 
the movement is reinforcing itself said a fighter nicknamed 
penguin a doctor said nearly 600 children were born in the camp 
last year 
the articulate talk idealistically about why they fight others 
can say no more than that they left because the piricuacos came 
a few generally among the higher ranking were members of former 
nicaraguan dictator anastasio somozas army and fought from day 
one 
but there are also bricklayers ranch workers truckers doctors 
sharecroppers who joined when the sandinista government tried to 
force them into a cooperative 
some said a brother or father was arrested or tortured and there 
are those who took the opportunity to shed abusive parents family 
problems or a criminal past 
they give themselves nicknames like lightning 
pointblank leopard and rambo sometimes known as 
gordo behind his back but also rabbit and quetzal an 
ancient indian god of the air 
roberto martinez comandante nolan keeps his 700 men in 
shape with volleyball boxing marches and extra drills what 
little we guerrillas know he said apologetically as about 50 
recruits executed a sloppy maneuver 
martinez at 23 twice wounded is less than half the age of some 
of the men he commands all that matters here is ability and 
leadership he said 
armed guards are posted 24 hours a day patrols move through the 
hills and combat discipline is observed on trails marchers spread 
out to prevent casualties with a rear guard yards behind 
last week there was a brief firefight with leftist honduran 
guerrillas officers said and there is always the danger of 
sandinista infiltrators seeking intelligence 
most men live in 10by6foot huts with camouflage plastic roofs 
and walls although some have built straw or wood walls and even 
small mudandwood houses 
some guys are architects said julio vargas cruz known as 
hunter he sticks to plastic although it gets too hot in the 
sun 
the most permanent structures are at cim spanish initials for 
the center for military instruction 
cim pronounced seem is a twohour hike from the main camp 
across a jungle mountain trail three feet deep in mud when it rains 
here even as about 600 men took tests in map reading and 
military tactics to qualify as officers others worked on wooden 
buildings with tin roofs so that classes would not have to be held 
outdoors or under ponchos 
we are not wasting our time here we are preparing ourselves 
during this pause in the war an instructor told about 40 officer 
candidates in an open tent 
a kitchen turns out 900 handmade tortillas a day theres also a 
small slaughterhouse and a pit with a barbed wire grill big enough 
to barbecue four sides of beef 
some of the beef is sold by local hondurans at about 233 a head 
honduran merchants peddle everything from dandruff shampoo to cowboy 
boots baby clothes and underwear are big sellers 
but there also are complaints ranging from drunken driving to 
rape although most confess there is much less thievery and lack of 
discipline than they thought there would be 
you know that when somebody kills somebody down here all he 
has to do is join the contra and hes safe said ramon valladares 
whose son just opened a tire repair store in danli 55 miles from 
the contra camp and the nearest large town 
the trucks valentin valladares services are carrying food paid 
for by a us humanitarian aid program that provides a monotonous 
but steady diet of beans rice and tortillas with occasional meat 
some officers worry about the camps children boys above the age 
of about 10 work as camp aides girls work in the kitchens as do 
most of their mothers 
we would like to have aid the us agency for international 
development give us some pencils chalk and blackboards so we can 
start schools for the kids and for the illiterate said battalion 
commander caliman 
caliman like most others said he plans to return to his former 
job when we win the war assuming im not dead in his case 
sharecropping with coffeepicking in season 
19 who refused to explain his nickname was among the less 
hopeful he made cigar boxes in nicaragua loved his work and tried 
to find work at the plasencia cigar factory in honduras 
but you need a honduran id and a work permit and the honduran 
unions are tough he said im over 50 and i cant fight 
anymore but ill go on because i have to 
his attitude is an exception to the determination expressed by 
most 
when i started there was no thought we would ever get aid from 
the united states said adan de jesus vargas garcia 
known as commandante javier he brought 30 men three women and 
15 children out of nicaragua last week because i didnt have 
anything left to fight with his wife was wounded in the foot 
during the trip 
with or without help said the former smalltime cattle 
dealer well go on fighting

l william seidman a toughtalking bank 
regulator who looks a little like daddy warbucks is braced for his 
good name to get splattered quickly now that president bush has made 
him deposit insurance czar and plopped the savings and loan crisis 
in his lap 
in more than three years at the helm of the federal deposit 
insurance corp which backs commercial bank deposits seidman 67 
has acquired a reputation as a straight shooter 
when his agency announces good news such as a jump in bank 
profits hes more likely to focus on negatives such as an uptick 
in bad loans in the northeast or banks growing dependence on 
leveraged buyouts 
over the past year congressional committees unhappy with what 
they viewed as overlyrosy estimates from sampl regulators at the 
federal home loan bank board increasingly have turned to seidman 
for information about savings and loans even though they werent 
under his jurisdiction 
his personality is very blunt hes a nononsense guy and he 
doesnt mince words said robert litan a banking expert at the 
brookings institution a washington think tank i think a lot of 
politicians appreciate that 
seidman is an old hand and has the confidence of people in 
washington explained rep charles schumer dny a member of 
the house banking committee and hes been right on the issue 
unlike the bank board he has not had to change his tune every few 
months 
although seidman has presided over the worst three years for bank 
failures since the depression he also has had two important 
advantages not enjoyed by m danny wall his counterpart for sampls a 
large experienced staff that had escaped reaganera budget cuts 
and a solvent insurance fund 
now that seidman under bushs plan to resolve the savings and 
loan crisis gets actual not just defacto authority over sampls he 
may be in for tougher times 
many people including the fdic chairman himself think the era 
of good feelings could quickly end as the fdic wrestles with the 
intractable thrift problem 
i think you will shortly be doing a story on this guys the 
most inept mudcovered regulator weve ever seen how could we have 
ever thought hes reasonably good seidman a short nearlybald 
craggyfeatured man predicted in a recent interview 
commercial banking despite all the failures is relatively 
healthy posting record high earnings last year the savings 
industry by any measure is ailing about 350 of the 3000 sampls in 
the nation are insolvent the business lost more money in 1988 than 
at any time in 50 years and only one in four institutions now have 
enough money invested by their owners to meet the stricter capital 
standards bushs plan would require in two years 
were going into a very difficult situation to which every 
answer will be painful and which contains all kinds of booby 
traps and not many rewards seidman said there arent going to 
be any miracles 
others arent as pessimistic at least about the prospects for 
seidmans reputation 
seidman is coming in at the right time said former senate 
banking committee chairman william proxmire who retired this year 
after 30 years in the senate people realize sampls are in horrible 
shape its like coming in to coach a football team that has had 
a disastrous season if he wins three or four games hes a 
genius 
some in washington think seidman is already a genius for having 
doubled his power and simultaneously protected the bank insurance 
fund from being raided to pay for sampl problems 
when asked in the months leading up to the announcement of 
bushs sampl proposal whether he wanted jurisdiction over thrift 
institutions seidman had a stock answer we prefer to go it 
alone but were willing to help if asked 
even now he insists it was not a job we wanted we never asked 
for it there was no hidden agenda for us to end up where we are 
now 
but a senior bank board official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said he had a very good set of cards and he played 
them very well 
in a city where turf is your measure of success hes very 
quietly amassing a very big one and very coyly as well said 
barton naylor a former senate banking committee aide now on the 
staff of the investor responsibility research center 
seidmans strong suit in the struggle has been his longstanding 
ties to the republican establishment dating back to the 
administration of gerald ford a boyhood friend from grand rapids 
mich 
when ford became president he hired seidman head of a 
familyowned accounting firm to be a white house assistant for 
economic affairs 
it was seidman who interviewed alan greenspan now chairman of 
the federal reserve board to determine whether ford should nominate 
the economist as chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers 
during the ford years seidman worked closely with james a baker 
iii then an assistant secretary of commerce and with richard 
darman then a young baker aide thats the same baker who is 
secretary of state now the same darman who is head of the office of 
management and budget seidman traveled often to langley va to 
review central intelligence agency economic reports with george 
bush then cia director 
he has known secretary of the treasury nicholas brady for 30 
years 
darman called me up the other day and said now that youve 
got all your proteges in office what are you going to do 
seidman said i said im going to retire and enjoy it 
but that wont be until the administrations sampl program is well 
under way he said 
another asset that helps seidman win over democrats is his 
pragmatism according to kenneth guenther of the independent bankers 
association of america 
hes been around the block four of five times hes not an 
ideologue guenther said 
thats obvious from seidmans successful effort to block several 
sampl proposals pushed by bushs more conservative advisers 
when word of the treasury departments proposal to impose a 
direct fee on depositors leaked seidman dubbed it the reverse 
toaster plan instead of getting a toaster when you open an account 
you give them one 
the remark reportedly infuriated white house chief of staff john 
sununu but seidman isnt apologetic 
i wasnt trying to be obstreperous on the other hand i did 
think it was a very bad idea and i thought it might be better to try 
to deal with it with humor rather than analysis he said 
seidman also is fighting an idea advocated by greenspan and 
others that lowering the 100000 deposit insurance limit would 
give bank and sampl customers incentive to make sure their 
institutions are soundly managed 
bush wants the treasury department to study the issue for a year 
who in the world wants to get people thinking in a public way 
that theyre going to change deposit insurance seidman asked

to the public nancy klein is a

publicized legal whirlwind over whether her husband could order an 
abortion 
but to her friends and family she is outgoing a fashion

television camera crews and reporters outside court she just 
wouldnt believe this 
nancy klein 32 lost consciousness on dec 13 when her car 
skidded on snow and was struck by an oncoming car she suffered 
massive brain damage 
doctors told her husband of nine years a 34yearold accountant 
that she stood a better chance of surviving if the fetus she was 
carrying was aborted klein went to court to be named her guardian 
so he could arrange an abortion 
guardianship was granted but abortion opponents challenged the 
ruling delaying the procedure by appeals on friday the court of 
appeals the states highest court refused to hear the case and 
us supreme court justice thurgood marshall did the same 
early saturday the abortion was performed on mrs klein who 
friends said would be mortified if she knew of the attention paid to 
her case 
we were uncomfortable at first going to her hospital room when 
we heard she was in the accident said nat borg a close friend 
we knew she would be embarrassed to have people see her that way 
she was described as the first to help out slow to anger an 
eager hostess 
you could drop in for a surprise visit at 11 oclock at 
night borg recalls nancy would pull out an unbelievable spread 
of food from the refrigerator gourmet dishes which she had made 
herself

irans main rebel group says it has the 
military might to overthrow ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
government but analysts dismiss the claim and say the insurgents 
latest raid severely damaged their cause 
hussein mahdavi a senior official of the iraqibased mujahedeen 
khalq or peoples holy warriors would not say how long it might 
take to overthrow irans islamic fundamentalist government which is 
celebrating its 10th anniversary 
if you look at the divisions inside the khomeini regime 
and compare it to the resistance ready at any time to overthrow the 
regime you cannot seriously speak about needing years he said in 
a recent interview with the associated press weve shown that we 
have the ability to militarily overthrow this regime 
the mujahedeens military arm the national liberation army made 
a largescale incursion into western iran just before the aug 20 
ceasefire in the iraniraq war 
the rebels still hand out literature by the pound claiming the 
raid called eternal light was a major victory but diplomats say 
khomeinis revolutionary guards soundly beat the insurgents 
the mujahedeen is believed to have no more than 15000 fighters 
and it admits losing 1000 in the raid in addition thousands of 
their supporters in iran were arrested and many were believed 
executed 
diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said eternal light 
undermined whatever support the rebels had in iran 
talk of overthrowing khomeini is sheer dreaming and sheer 
stupidity said one western military analyst who spoke on 
condition of anonymity what could they do where would they go 
they got destroyed in the eternal light operation 
much of irans civilian population has been moved away from the 
border during the iraniraq war so capturing territory would be a 
limited threat to the government analysts said 
they argued that since the millionstrong hightech iraqi army 
could not overwhelm the iranians in eight years of war it is highly 
unlikely the rebels could 
even if the rebels did have an army ready to cross the border 
the analysts said iraqi president saddam hussein appears committed 
to peace negotiations and probably would not allow the insurgents to 
attack 
iraqi officials declined to comment on the mujahedeens future 
everything on those issues will be dependent on iranian 
behavior said deputy foreign minister nizar hamdoon its 
premature to address this point at the moment 
the mujahedeen appear to have broad support in iraq they still 
broadcast a nightly halfhour television program and one diplomat 
noted the post office box listed on their official paper is the same 
used by the culture and information ministry 
but iraq has expelled iranian resistance groups before khomeini 
himself spent 15 years in the holy city of najaf but was asked to 
leave in 1978 during a moment of detente in iraniraq relations 
mahdavi conceded a peace treaty might mean iraq would bar the 
mujahedeen from staging military operations across the border he 
would not say if the rebels are conducting operations now 
the mujahedeen were allied with khomeini in the 1979 revolution 
that toppled irans monarchy but the fundamentalists turned on 
their liberal allies in 1981 and killed thousands in a bloody purge 
peace negotiations between iran and iraq have been stalled since 
november mahdavi accused iran of delaying talks because of internal 
differences and said a treaty might trigger a civil war 
at that time the nla will embark on overthrowing the 
khomeini regime mahdavi said

a man who has pleaded guilty to wild animal 
poaching charges kept a ledger that shows he netted about 600000 
from the illegal slaughter of hundreds of animals including bald 
eagles officials said 
the ledger taken from the home of ralph j jackson in sequim 
indicates he poached at least 25 bald eagles and hundreds of other 
wild animals ron perregrin of the state department of wildlife said 
at a news conference friday 
jackson 38 was charged with poaching 13 elk in late september 
after an anonymous caller told officials jackson had an illegally 
obtained polar bear skin perregrin said 
investigators never found the polar bear skin but they 
discovered illegally obtained elk and deer and the ledger 
perregrin said 
sales listed in the ledger over 3 years include 25 eagles sold 
for 512650 135 elk for 28500 286 deer for 24270 18 native 
cats for 15150 12 seals for 14500 and nine hawks for 2775 
the ledger also listed purchasers and the investigation 
continues perregrin said 
federal authorities arrested jackson in october after he 
threatened the lives of a witness in the eagle transactions and 
several investigating officers and their families perregrin said 
the department has talked to many local people who knew jackson 
was a poacher perregrin said but no one knew the extent of his 
activities and just assumed he took a deer or two for dinner for the 
family 
records indicate jackson was receiving public assistance 
jackson pleaded guilty in clallam and jefferson counties to 
poaching charges and was sentenced to up to 24 years in prison 
perregrin said he also pleaded guilty to 10 federal felony counts 
of selling bald eagles and one count of threatening a federal 
witness 
he is in custody awaiting sentencing feb 23 on the federal 
counts and could face additional prison time and millions of 
dollars in fines 
his wife elaine also pleaded guilty in connection with the 
poaching he said

the unveiling of president bushs 1990 spending 
plan focuses the budget spotlight on the coming fiscal year just 
as the deficit figures for this year are getting more and more 
embarrassing 
the imbalance is not only expanding like a wet blot of red ink on 
a piece of paper but once again as has happened every year since 
the grammrudman balanced budget law was passed in 1985 the actual 
deficit is going to be far higher than the deficit ceiling the 
legislation sets 
the budget bush presented to congress for fiscal 1990 last 
thursday revealed that the administration now expects the 1989 
deficit to be 1702 billion less than four months ago the 
outgoing reagan administration forecast that the imbalance would be 
1455 billion 500 million below the 146 billion target set in 
the grammrudman law 
its a coconspiracy between congress and the administration 
says rudolph g penner former director of the congressional budget 
office and its hard to think of any other word to describe it 
than dishonest 
penner now a senior fellow at the urban institute in washington 
was referring to the process set in law that is designed to force 
congress and the white house to reduce the federal deficit 
lawmakers and the president spend most of each year dueling with 
each other over the budget with much of their battling devoted to 
deciding how they will produce a spending plan that meets the 
deficit target of the grammrudman balanced budget law 
every year the smoke clears in the fall or winter to reveal an 
agreement in which the projected red ink falls just within the 
deficit target and the awesome hammer of the law forced spending 
cuts on domestic and defense programs totaling billions of dollars 
is avoided 
but the key word here is projected the grammrudman law is a 
process that deals with the projected deficit for the coming year 
setting declining ceilings for each year until the budget is 
supposed to be balanced in 1993 
if the final projection for each fiscal year made in 
midoctober two weeks into that year falls within the target the 
automatic cuts are avoided 
but once the projected deficit is certified as falling within the 
target the laws machinery grinds to a halt the law sets no 
consequences if the actual deficit at the end of the year turns out 
to be higher than the grammrudman target 
budget experts say the deficit projections are off because of the 
difficulties of predicting how the economy will perform and how 
quickly some programs will spend money 
they say that in addition the economic forecasts used are 
optimistic and thus underestimate the magnitude of the shortfall 
after all its easier to pronounce the deficit smaller than it is 
to say it is larger and then have to enact spending cuts and tax 
increases to shrink it 
theyre avoiding political pain said stanley collender who 
oversees budget policy for the price waterhouse accounting firm 
some say the way congress and the white house focus each year on 
deficit projections is such a charade that the press is partially to 
blame for paying so much attention to it 
were all a little surprised that you all report that in such a 
straightfaced manner says carol cox president of the bipartisan 
watchdog group the committee for a responsible federal budget 
experts are divided over just how significant it is that the 
target is consistently missed 
some like penner say it is deceptive and postpones true 
deficitreduction decisions others like collender say a deficit 
difference of a few billion dollars in a 5 trillion economy is 
relatively harmless 
following are the deficit targets for each fiscal year since 
grammrudman took effect and the actual deficits that occurred 
1986 target 1719 billion deficit 221 billion 
1987 target 144 billion deficit 1504 billion 
1988 target 144 billion deficit 155 billion 
only in 1986 were automatic spending cuts triggered by the 
grammrudman law

the chairman of the house agriculture committee 
has been consulting with mexican lawmakers on ways to help reduce 
that countrys massive foreign debt and expand its market for us 
farm goods 
the longterm potential for the growth of the united states 
exports is greater in mexico than in virtually any other country in 
the world said rep e kika de la garza dtexas in a recent 
interview 
the comment came following a meeting last week with three members 
of mexicos senate 
mexico is already our thirdlargest trading partner in the 
world and the potential for expansion of that trade is directly 
proportional to our ability to foster trade in both directions 
said de la garza 
de la garza said he urged the three senators mario niebla 
alvarez jose de jesus padilla and bulmaro pacheco to weigh the 
idea of a freetrade agreement with this country similar to the 
ones the united states has with israel and canada 
those agreements call for elimination of most tariffs between the 
parties over the next decade 
de la garza said that to begin with such an accord with mexico 
could be limited to individual sectors such as automotive or 
agriculture 
he said he is also asking treasury secretary nicholas brady to 
consider broadening banking guidelines to permit mexico to 
capitalize part of its external debt a means of converting 
interest on the debt into part of the loan 
that way less cash would leave mexico to service its 105 billion 
debt and the money could be injected into the economy to produce 
additional exports de la garza said he said it would generate 
badly needed export income and create jobs in a country experiencing 
an unemployment rate of about 20 percent 
the money could also be used to buy more imports from the united 
states and elsewhere 
the economic prosperity of mexico is in our best interests 
since an economically and politically unstable mexico might prove to 
be a national security risk for the united states de la garza

but that didnt satisfy the public which has been clamoring for 
an explanation ever since the book was turned into a hit cbstv 
miniseries broadcast last week 
we got about 15 to 20 calls the day after the final episode 
dallas public library researcher marilyn jackson said friday the 
fourday series wound up wednesday 
the motto uva uvam vivendo varia fit appeared on the sign 
for the hat creek cattle company and livery emporium mccrae thought 
that whatever it meant it would lend some dignity to the sign 
in the tv series the motto also became mccraes epitaph as call 
used the remains of the sign to mark his grave 
ms jackson said researcher carl perkins translated the motto as 
the grape is made manifold by living 
two latin scholars offered different views 
isaac tennison a lecturer at the university of texasarlington 
says its a grape becomes mature by living only as a grape 
bruce macqueen of the university of dallas translates it as a 
grape becomes a different kind of grape by living or in the 
process of living 
macqueen added that the motto was improperly constructed saying 
that under latins complex rules for the endings of words the 
uvam should be another uva he called it a mistake that a 
schoolboy who was learning to write latin might make 
uva or uvam macqueen said he was pleased with the interest in 
latin aroused by the story 
were not going to look any gift publicity in the mouth he 
said

the road signs marking a travelers entry into 
the village of bug have bugged out twice leaving the man who 
lobbied for them well bugged 
maybe ill put them up in a tree said glynn mann who 
successfully lobbied to have the signs installed and is now trying 
to figure out how to thiefproof the next pair of green and white 
bug signs 
bugloving bandits have struck twice stealing the two signs 
within a day after the state installed them last march and then 
stealing the replacements within a few days of their installation in 
october 
we appeared and disappeared said manns wife shirley who 
indulges with good humor her husbands efforts to mark the central 
kentucky village of 50 about 2 miles north of the 
kentuckytennessee line 
a new set of signs has been ordered but not yet installed as mann 
ponders his next move 
bug got its name perhaps a century ago when some men were 
standing around trying to decide what to name the new post office 
said 70yearold harley jones a lifelong resident a bug crawled 
across the road and they said well call it bug jones said 
another version of the story mann said is that the men choosing 
the name were sitting around in a general store and saw the fateful 
bug crawl up the wall

usual claim seeking up to a few thousand dollars for such things as 
tripping and falling when lights are turned low

his company is involved with 7500 to 10000 concerts a year

federal authorities should expand tough new 
antiterrorism measures to cover foreign air carriers with landing 
rights in the united states says the chairman of the senate finance 
committee 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said in a letter to transportation 
secretary samuel k skinner released saturday he was dismayed 
that emergency security precautions taken after the holiday bombing 
of pan am flight 103 apply only to domestic carriers with 
international flights 
i do not think it requires a quantum leap in logic to conclude 
that as it becomes more difficult to penetrate the security of us 
flag carriers because of their superior security systems the 
terrorist threat may well shift to foreign air carriers which carry 
a large number of american passengers bentsen said 
about half of americans traveling abroad fly on foreign carriers 
he said 
if the primary basis for the emergency rulemaking is to 
minimize terrorism aimed at americans particularly and the 
international traveling public generally then i do not see how it 
is accomplished by a blanket exemption to foreign air carriers to 
the requirement for improved security operations bentsen said 
the federal aviation administration in late december announced 
tightened security procedures by us air carriers at 103 airports 
in the middle east and western europe including xray or physical 
inspection of all checked baggage and random physical checks of some 
carryon baggage 
the added measures were prompted by the bombing of flight 103 
over scotland which 270 persons dead 
bentsen said the measures did not go far enough 
the problem is that they faa offered a half a loaf and half a 
loaf is just not good enough when youre talking about terrorism 
bentsen said 
bentsen said he was also urging skinner to have the faa 
coordinate its activities with the intelligence community in 
tracking terrorist activity and guarding against sabotage 
skinner will head a us delegation to a special session of the 
council of the international civil aviation organization on 
wednesday and thursday in montreal where protecting aviation from 
terrorists will be discussed 
the transportation department said the meetings primary purpose 
will be to improve the councils international standards on 
passengers baggage and cargo security related to sabotage the 
group will also consider how standard security measures might to 
expanded and applied uniformly to operations considered to be at 
high risk of sabotage

theres barely a decimal points difference 
between the reagan and bush budgets but president bushs plan is 
packaged to make the changes hes made look more dramatic 
he tries to put the most shine on the least shoe to reflect 
toward congress and the american people the things they want to see 
by following the timehonored washington tradition of jumbling the 
numbers 
on the one hand bushs kinder and gentler budget includes 
freezing the military budget a sharp departure from the growth 
advocated by reagan he defines the pentagon freeze as increasing 
spending 21 billion to keep pace with inflation a socalled 
current services freeze 
but elsewhere in his budget he ridicules the concept of 
maintaining current services as defining a freeze assuming 
adjustments to cover inflationary costs in domestic programs is 
wonderland budgeting he says 
his budget compares the domestic budgets with current fiscal 1989 
levels without mention of what providing the same services would 
cost next year this approach allows bush to minimize the appearance 
of cuts and maximize the apparent increases in his fiscal 1990 plan 
in sum increasing pentagon spending with inflation is a freeze 
in the bush budget increasing the education budget but not enough 
to maintain current services is not a freeze 
along the same lines the president studiously avoids direct 
comparisons with reagans spending plan 
he claims with some fanfare initiatives to increase spending on 
aids research and the space program compared to reagan theres no 
increase at all but the reagan numbers arent in bushs book you 
have to go to another document to find them 
further complicating any comparisons with his predecessor bushs 
budget drafters calculated his figures without the credit reforms 
that reagan included in his accounting that technical difference 
makes some of bushs numbers look hundreds of millions of dollars 
different from reagans when in many cases they are exactly the 
same 
in the case of fighting drugs bushs new spending initiative 
isnt so new three quarters of the nearly 1 billion bush claims as 
his antidrug program is money already approved by congress 
mostly the bush budget as revealed so far is incomplete 
bush explicitly changes only about four dozen out of some 4000 
line items in the budget left behind by his predecessor 
it claims to be increasing spending on important domestic 
programs but often lists them within a group where the total 
spending is unchanged from reagans plan it doesnt say what other 
programs in that group would go down to compensate or by how much 
budget director richard darman said thursday that bush was 
rejecting reagans plan to reduce school lunch programs by 800 
million that change from the reagan plan is nowhere in the budget 
document he released and theres no indication where the spending 
would be cut to make up the difference 
darman says the administration is projecting about 96 billion 
in total savings from hundreds of programs placed in a socalled 
flexible freeze box with congress to take a lead role in deciding 
which individual programs to cut which to increase and which to 
keep static other analysts say the administration seems to be 
counting on about 11 billion in savings from that box approach 
but spelling out the billions of dollars in cuts implicit in the 
plan would give more ammunition to critics on capitol hill and 
elsewhere it would dull the shine

candlelight dinners and cool winter 
evenings may sound romantic but some residents of this city would 
give almost anything to turn the lights on over a hot meal 
five days after an ice storm robbed an estimated 80000 
mississippi power amp light customers of electricity about 10100 
were still without power late friday repair crews continued to work 
saturday 
jean and tom king were waiting for mpampl officials to reattach 
their power lines that were felled in the storm 
they say they have filled out work orders for us and thats as 
far as theyve gotten mrs king said 
i have gas bathroom heaters and another gas heater she said 
do you know of a tv that runs on gas 
most highs statewide were only in the 30s for most of the week 
and lows were in the 20s with wind chill factors in the teens 
temperatures saturday warmed up into the 50s and 60s 
power had been restored to most of the other homes on the kings 
street 
both the kings and neighbor charlotte runnelses said they had 
their electric meters reattached at their own cost and were just 
waiting for the power company to do its part 
im very unhappy with mpampl runnels said im not going to 
pay my bill until its late 
public service commissioner chairman nielsen cochran met with 
mpampl officials for almost two hours friday to discuss the utilitys 
alleged trouble in communicating with customers and restoring 
service 
i think the most critical area which i emphasized numerous 
times this afternoon was that i thought their attempt to notify the 
public as to the status of the service and their efforts to repair 
customer service was totally inadequate cochran said 
but mpampl spokesman jim moore said an estimated 1350 power 
company workers some of them from alabama arkansas and louisiana 
were working on repairs 
an ice storm is like a tornado its like a flood moore 
said theres only so much you can humanly do

the justice department today appealed to the 
supreme court to delay oliver norths trial out of concern the 
former white house aide will disclose too much classified 
information in his defense 
attorney general dick thornburgh submitted the appeal to the high 
court after a federal appeals court panel for the second time in two 
days rejected the departments bid to delay the proceedings 
the appeal to the supreme court said north is in a position to 
disclose highly sensitive classified information at trial and it 
appears that the government will not be accorded its procedural 
rights 
proceeding with the trial on those terms will make it 
impossible for the attorney general to fulfill his responsibility to 
safeguard classified information the appeal said 
thornburgh said friday that us district judge gerhard a gesell 
has failed to impose stringent enough controls on what classified 
material north may use at trial on charges stemming from the 
irancontra affair 
a jury in the case was chosen thursday and gesell asked them to 
return to court monday morning 
unfortunately the judge in this case has chosen not to follow 
the provisions of the classified information procedures act 
thornburgh said 
in a 14page appeals court filing the justice department said 
the extraordinary developments in this proceeding that have 
transpired over the past few days are the consequence of gesells 
repeated refusal to follow the pretrial procedures set out 
under cipa 
cipa sets up screening procedures for use of classified material 
in criminal cases 
the attorney general also criticized independent counsel lawrence 
walsh who is prosecuting north for opposing the justice 
departments effort to delay the case 
i dont understand why the independent counsel doesnt share 
with the department of justice the desire to see that the law that 
congress passed is followed thornburgh said in an interview with 
reporters and editors of knightridder newspapers i cannot 
explain it 
the justice department court filing said decisions about the 
disclosure of national security information fall well beyond the 
immediate concerns of an individual prosecutor whose interests are 
confined by the desire to prosecute a particular case 
until wednesday walsh and the justice department had been 
cooperating in trying to overcome the problems classified material 
is presenting in the case 
in a jan 19 order under cipa gesell said that north may use 
classified material that tends to show that his intent and purpose 
was not to violate the law another section of the order allows 
north to use classified material to show that a statement made by a 
government witness during the trial is false or misleading 
intelligence agencies felt this gave north too much leeway to 
present classified material in the courtroom 
gesell later rejected a government request to set up a mechanism 
by which norths lawyers would be required to provide advance notice 
or obtain an order from the court before disclosing classified 
information 
the department on wednesday began seeking a court order barring 
north from disclosing any classified information to which the us 
government has an objection pending 
in rejecting the departments request the threemember panel of 
the circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia noted that 
the legal avenue left open to thornburgh is to file an affidavit 
under cipa declaring that certain classified information could harm 
national security 
such a step could lead to dismissal of at least some of the 
criminal charges against north and to possibly throwing out the 
entire case 
once the attorney general files an affidavit gesell would be 
required to order that north not disclose that classified material 
which is at issue 
such a procedure could force dismissal of some or all of the 12 
criminal charges against north because he would be unable to 
introduce evidence that would prove him innocent

running under canadian satisfaction with president 
bushs promise to act on acid rain is a bitter current that says 
its about time 
there also is considerable reluctance to get too complacent until 
specifics of bushs program are known 
on bushs first trip outside the united states since his 
inauguration he promised friday to move quickly with congressional 
legislation to control acid rain 
he also said after his meetings with prime minister brian 
mulroney that the united states would move toward discussions with 
canada for an accord on the controversial issue 
the presidents comments on the subject mark a small step 
forward in the longstanding environmental dispute between the two 
countries the globe and mail newspaper wrote saturday 
however without an exact us timetable for the discussions 
or commitments on the amount or timing of any cuts on transborder 
air pollution canada may still have to wait years before there is 
tangible relief on the issue the toronto daily wrote in 
frontpage coverage of the visit 
canadian concern about the acid rain blamed for killing some 
14000 lakes in the eastern part of the country and defoliating 
millions of acres of forests has been a dominant issue in relations 
with the united states for the past decade 
one of bushs two official visits to canada as vice president was 
in january 1987 when he came to ottawa to hear mulroneys 
complaints that the united states was holding back on acid rain 
cleanup 
frustration grew in canada during the eight years of the reagan 
administration when the pomp of summit meetings produced virtually 
no results on the issue 
for example the reagan administration did not once propose 
legislation to strengthen the us federal clean air act 
more than half the acid rain in eastern canada comes from the 
united states and in some areas us emissions of sulphur dioxide 
and other materials cause 70 percent of acid fallout according to 
the canadian government 
the program to control canadian emissions takes full effect in 
1994 
i think mr bushs approach is a 180degree reversal in us 
policy said michael perley of the canadian coalition on acid rain 
lobbying group 
he told reporters that while reagan did not even recognize acid 
rain as a problem the situation now is that weve got the right 
principle the right approach 
perley also said the specific amount of emissions to be cut and 
the timetable for doing so are critical 
senior canadian diplomatic officials speaking on condition they 
not be further identified said they understand bushs need to 
outline the specifics to congress first 
at a joint news conference with bush mulroney said the 
presidents position represents quite substantial progress you 
know it wasnt so long ago that canada was sort of going it alone 
in many ways in this area 
bush said he assured mulroney that the time for just pure study 
was over and that weve now approached the time for legislative 
action 
the united states apparently would be willing to start talks for 
the bilateral agreement canada long has sought on acid rain after 
the legislation is moving forward possibly as early as this year 
environmental concerns ran strong among canadian voters polled 
during the campaign last fall that returned mulroneys progressive 
conservative party for a second consecutive majority government 
indeed barbara bush was reminded by a reporter as she toured the 
national gallery of canada that lakes portrayed in the paintings she 
was seeing were endangered by acid rain

marcos and his wife imelda have lived here since marcos ouster 
from power in february 1986 
the marcoses are under us indictment for allegedly stealing 
more than 100 million from their homeland and stashing much of the 
money in the united states 
defense lawyers for marcos asked a federal judge in new york on 
friday to remove the former president from a racketeering case for 
medical reasons 
federal prosecutors opposed the move saying it was too soon to 
make a final prognosis of marcos chances for recovery 
a continuation of a hearing by us district judge john f keenan 
to determine whether marcos is well enough to be arraigned in 
honolulu is scheduled for march 6 
marcos also has asked the administration of philippine president 
corazon aquino to allow him to return to his homeland to die but

it was the 2500 watch and the 13000 
mustang that put authorities on the trail of 18yearold frank riley 
wolsky 
investigators say the high school senior attended school 
regularly while running a cocaine business on the side and spending 
thousands of dollars on cars clothes and jewelry 
the teenagers fastlane lifestyle came to a halt jan 18 as he 
prepared to go to school in this suburb east of portland undercover 
police surrounded his car and arrested him on charges of possession 
and delivery of a controlled substance 
officers found 4 ounces of cocaine five firearms and 18000 in 
cash also seized was a chevrolet corvette customized ford mustang 
and a chevrolet blazer 
in november 1987 when he was 16 wolsky was arrested on a 
drugpossession charge his mother myra wolsky told authorities at 
the time she thought he was a dealer but the possession case never 
went to trial 
the regional organized crime task force an interagency law 
enforcement group began investigating wolsky in earnest last year 
after parents and businessmen told police about his spending sprees 
said investigator bob peterson 
reports of an 1800 clothesbuying trip and the purchase of the 
2500 watch crossed detectives desks 
we began looking at his activities and found that he was 
purchasing vehicles for cash peterson said he purchased a 1986 
mustang on sept 24 10 days after his 18th birthday for 13000 
cash 
he moved into a 1000amonth apartment on aug 8 we looked 
at cash expenditures of 25000 over a onemonth period he said 
it all began to develop a pattern not consistent with a high 
school student 
peterson said wolsky did most of his business from his 
thirdfloor apartment at johns landing a trendy section of portland 
a world away from gresham 
wolsky didnt use drugs himself maintained a low profile at the 
apartment and was known as a nice guy at school peterson said 
four or five primary customers of wolskys were the only ones 
who came to the apartment peterson said there were no wild 
parties 
investigators believe wolsky was a relatively smallscale dealer 
until he met narcisa l savinovich who was at the time free pending 
appeal after being sentenced to five years in prison for selling 
cocaine the night before his arrest last month wolsky stopped at 
the 26yearold womans house and emerged with two paper bags 
peterson said 
savinovich was arrested indicted on new drug charges and 
immediately began serving her previously imposed sentence 
alex gordon special assistant us attorney said oregon charges 
against wolsky have been withdrawn so that he can be prosecuted in 
the federal system where stiffer sentences are possible a federal 
grand jury is considering the case 
while the 390 other students in wolskys senior class dream about 
life after graduation wolsky is keeping silent about his future 
he has been expelled from school and is back home in gresham 
living with his mother a parole and probation officer with the 
oregon department of corrections 
my lawyer advised me not to say anything at all wolsky said 
over the telephone his mother also had no comment 
at gresham high school principal rich correa said he thought it 
was a farce that wolsky was released after putting up 650 of 
6500 bail after his arrest 
correa said rumors about wolskys drug trade had been circulating 
for some time his arrest was not a surprise he said he was 
a shrewd student who stayed out of trouble here but he was not your 
typical student who all of a sudden gets involved with a drug 
problem 
peterson said he hopes wolskys arrest will send a message that 
will deter classmates from dealing drugs but unfortunately the 
only message they may get is dont be quite so flamboyant with your 
proceeds 
carri kendall the high schools studentbody president was 
similarly pessimistic about the effect of the arrest 
it will be helpful in slowing down drug dealing for a while 
but it will be a shortterm effect she said we will graduate 
a new class will come in and someone new will start getting rich

the thaw in ussoviet relations has warmed up 
the world of art with the justannounced october mingling of the 
priceless faberge egg collections owned by capitalist malcolm s 
forbes and the soviet union 
the exchange is very closely related to the improvement of 
relations irina rodimtseva director of the moscow armory museum 
said friday through an interpreter only when countries and people 
trust each other can such an exchange take place 
were calling this eggnost said christopher forbes whose 
billionaire father owns a dozen of the imperial eggs the 
handcrafted artworks were designed between 1884 and 1917 and 
presented to the russian czars alexander iii and nicholas ii 
the soviets own 10 of the handcrafted eggs san diego mayor 
maureen oconnor whose city will be host of the treasures of the 
soviet union exhibition from oct 21nov 11 said the exact 
number of eggs on display is under negotiation 
obviously this is a first not only for san diego but for the 
united states oconnor said it means a lot for san diego 
were just very pleased 
as part of the deal several of forbes eggs will subsequently go 
to the soviet union for display in the kremlin christopher forbes 
agreed that the soviets new openness was the key to the 
unprecedented loans 
such a thing has never happened before even during previous 
thaws we were never able to get the eggs rolling he said 
according to oconnor the groundbreaking exhibition was 
arranged with less trouble and international red tape than she 
anticipated when the idea first came up 
it was my dream to have the soviet eggs in san diego and madam 
rodimtsevas dream to have mr forbes eggs in the soviet union 
she explained she agreed to loan her eggs if mr forbes would do 
the same 
although christopher forbes said he quickly agreed to this swap 
he never believed it would come about 
i said yes with the firm belief that nobody would call he 
said when they did i had to convince my father to let them go 
according to forbes the final factor which convinced his father 
to go along was the attitude of the soviet government toward the 
wealthy thrillseeker 
the fact that they treated us like another government convinced 
the capitalist tool to go along he said

us district judge alcee l hastings his 
impeachment trial in the us senate near has been on the road 
trying to rally support for what he concedes is a comefrombehind 
effort 
i have an uphill battle all the way hastings told 
listeners on a miami radio station talk show last week its going 
to be very difficult for me to extricate myself from this history 
demands that i try 
it was typical of the speaking appearances hes been making each 
week on radio shows and at churches colleges and civil rights 
groups 
with his senate trial expected to begin as early as midmarch 
hastings 52 has been urging listeners to write their senators to 
express interest in his case and contribute to his legal defense 
fund 
although the judge is often warmly received he has raised only 
4000 he unsuccessfully asked for government help for his defense 
expenses saying the justice department has spent 2 million for a 
witch hunt or fishing expedition against him 
hastings became the first black federal judge from florida when 
he was appointed by thenpresident carter in 1979 
he marked another less happy first last august when he became 
the only person ever to be impeached after he was already cleared of 
similar charges in a criminal trial the house vote to impeach or 
send the case to the senate for trial was 4133 
he is accused of conspiring with a former friend attorney 
william a borders to reduce a sentence of two convicted 
racketeers and of lying and fabricating his defense during his 1983 
criminal trial though hastings was acquitted in that trial borders 
was convicted of bribery conspiracy in a separate trial 
last month the senate rules committee dealt hastings another 
setback by deciding his trial would be largely conducted by a 
12member special committee before the full senate votes on whether 
to convict a twothirds majority would result in hastings removal 
from the bench 
on friday hastings attorney terence j anderson a university of 
miami law professor said he would file challenges to the rules 
committee decision along with motions to dismiss the 17 articles of 
impeachment 
he contends that hastings is unconstitutionally being tried twice 
for the same case because of the criminal trial supporters of the 
impeachment answer that just because a charge is not proven beyond a 
reasonable doubt to a jurys satisfaction does not mean that a judge 
is fit to stay on the bench 
the defense also argues that congress and the justice department 
may be trying to influence judicial independence through coercion 
hastings says the racial question bears on his troubles but is 
not the only cause 
im not going to go up to the beltway and say leave me alone 
because im black hastings said but he usually adds i do not 
believe i would be in this situation if i were not black 
he says he was targeted by a federal sting operation in 1981 
because of his liberal record on the bench particularly his strong 
opposition to justice department deportations of haitian aliens 
judicial colleagues acted against him because he wasnt a 
member of the club and because many of the reagan ideologues 
want to keep the minorities and women appointed during the carter 
administration in check he argued 
hastings called the overwhelming house vote rank politics 
rep larry smith a hollywood fla democrat and longtime 
political ally of hastings said he voted for impeachment even 
though such a vote was unlikely to help him politically he said he 
looked over the evidence carefully and felt he had no choice 
smith pointed out though that the impeachment was more like an 
indictment and doesnt mean he presumes hastings is guilty 
hastings reflected that his place in the history of the civil 
rights movement would be determined by the trials outcome 
i may be considered a visionary someone who fought the odds 
he said or i could be remembered only for being removed from the 
bench

defense secretarydesignate john tower 
contradicted an earlier sworn statement when he told the senate his 
work for a british firm involved no military matters according to 
reports published saturday 
meanwhile new questions were raised about the thoroughness of 
the fbis background investigation of the embattled nominee one 
newspaper reported that several bizarre accidents including 
earlymorning car crashes and a hotel fire apparently were 
overlooked in the probe 
the senate armed services committee has put the nomination of 
tower a former texas senator and onetime chairman of the committee 
on hold while it takes a second look at towers personal habits 
including his use of alcohol and his links to defense contractors 
tower who has declined to be interviewed while his nomination is 
pending has denied in his senate testimony any problem with alcohol 
or any conflicts of interest concerning his business ties 
a white house spokesman stephen hart declined on saturday to 
comment on the latest reports saying its the nomination before 
the committee 
towers designated spokesman attorney paul eggers of dallas did 
not answer a reporters calls saturday 
in written testimony to the senate panel on jan 26 tower said 
he could recall no actions in connection with any defense 
activities in connection with his work for the us subsidiary of 
british aerospace inc 
that statement according to two publications the los angeles 
times and the legal times did not square with information which 
tower provided to divorce attorneys working for his second wife in 
june of 1987 
in the divorce deposition tower said he went to work for british 
aerospace eight weeks after resigning as the nations chief 
strategic arms negotiator and advised the company on how to sell 
training jets fighter planes and missile systems to the pentagon 
the los angeles times reported 
tower told the senate committee he worked chiefly on selling 
commercial aircraft to us airlines and also advised the firm on 
trade legislation and currency fluctuations he said he earned 
265000 from the company between june of 1986 and last december 
the legal times said tower told the divorce attorneys that he was 
retained by british aerospace for his advice on how to sell weapons 
systems to the pentagon and that he listed the various weapons 
involved the deposition was never filed in court because tower did 
not contest the divorce but a copy was obtained by the fbi the 
legal times said it said its reporters were allowed by attorneys to 
read it with the understanding that it not be quoted directly 
the new york post reported saturday that the fbi apparently has 
not bothered to talk to towers neighbors examine certain police 
records or investigate several car accidents involving tower 
the post citing syndicated columnist cody shearer said the 
incidents included an earlymorning episode on june 6 1967 when 
tower was trapped in his hotel suite in dallas by a blaze he 
accidentally set by dropping a cigarette on an overstuffed armchair 
when firemen broke into his room to remove him he was 
reportedly in no condition to free himself the post said 
the newspaper also said tower wrecked his car in two 
earlymorning accidents within weeks of one another in 1970 and 
two years earlier he drove into a bicycle ridden by james patrick 
montoya son of the late sen joseph montoya dnm on his way 
home from work the youth was not seriously hurt 
fbi spokesman bill carter refused comment on specifics of the 
tower investigation but said we will follow any lead 
on friday tower authorized the release of a statement that 
recent hospital tests showed no evidence of alcohol abuse and vice 
president dan quayle said i have never seen drinking being a 
factor in john towers life other than a social glass of wine 
eggers meanwhile acknowledged that there was no question 
that tower sometimes drank too much in the early 1970s but he said 
he is not an alcoholic hes not had a drinking problem for 
years

the united states has tentatively 
approved deflagging six kuwaiti oil tankers but the deal depends 
on the ships remaining available to the united states in a national 
emergency us officials said saturday 
the six ships are among 11 kuwaiti tankers reregistered in july 
1987 by the united states entitling them to us navy protection as 
they carried kuwaiti petroleum exports through the wartorn persian 
gulf 
iran then in the seventh year of its war with iraq targeted 
kuwaiti ships because the arab state supported baghdad hostilities 
halted aug 20 when a unsponsored ceasefire took effect 
the pentagon announced jan 11 the united states was preparing to 
deflag six of the kuwaiti tankers it said the other five had been 
certified to continue flying the stars and stripes for another year 
walter oates a public affairs officer at the maritime 
administration said in a telephone interview the agency gave its 
tentative approval feb 7 for the six tankers to revert to 
kuwaiti registry 
but he said it was unclear how kuwait viewed the legal 
requirement that its ships remain available to the united states for 
possible use in a national crisis 
whether such a condition would be regarded by kuwait as 
impinging on its sovereignty only the kuwaitis could answer he 
said kuwaiti officials were not available immediately for comment 
us law stipulates the emergency availability as a condition 
for the us maritime administration to approve the sale or 
reregistry of americanowned and americanflagged commercial ships 
abroad 
another official who requested anonymity said it was not known 
whether the kuwaitis were aware of the provision or whether it 
would have made any difference at the time 
gulfbased shipping observers said another unknown factor was 
what practical value the huge tankers might have for the united 
states one possible use might be storage 
technically the 11 ships belong to the chesapeake shipping co 
of dover del a firm kuwait set up in 1987 to provide ostensible 
us ownership the ships return to stateowned kuwait oil tanker 
co apparently would be only a paper transfer not a sale 
the deflagging is the latest move by the united states to scale 
down its military role in the gulf reflecting what officials say 
are reduced tensions since the truce 
the united states tripled the strength of its force in the gulf 
as the tanker war worsened in 1987 now it has trimmed that force 
from 27 to 23 ships and no longer escorts tankers 
the six being deflagged include the 294739ton townsend and 
290085ton middletown both products carriers and four identical 
46723ton liquified gas carriers 
sources close to the kuwaiti owners said the two large tankers no 
longer meet maritime administration safety rules and the gas 
carriers were included because the united states does not have 
enough merchant seamen qualified to serve on them 
under the agreement kuwait has to replace its ships nonus 
crews with allamerican crews if they fly the us flag a legal 
provision waived at the time of the reflagging

the path taken by the rev barbara harris to her 
historic consecration saturday as episcopal bishop took her to 
prisons corporate board rooms divorce court and the editorial desk 
of a feisty liberal publication 
because that path did not include a college or seminary degree 
and because of what some view as her extreme leftwing views to 
say nothing of her gender harris consecration touched off heated 
debate in religious circles 
harris 58 became the first woman to become a bishop in any 
branch of christianity that traces its bishops in a direct line 
2000 years back to the time of christ in an elaborate ceremony 
saturday she was consecrated suffragan or assistant bishop of the 
boston episcopal diocese 
the issue of a woman assuming the miter and scepter of a bishop 
would engender debate throughout christiandom regardless of the 
nominee harris provoked all the more discussion because of her 
background 
some of the opposition to her elevation stemmed from her race as 
well as her sex says harris who is black 
in the end her support was just as vocal and greater in quantity 
than the opposition 
i think the time is right for it harris said recently and 
i hope that we will soon see other women being elected and 
consecrated as bishops 
harris has been involved in chuch activities throughout her life 
following the example of her mother beatrice who attended the 
consecration harris sang in church choirs and taught in church 
schools at st barnabus in philadelphia 
during the 1960s harris became involved in the civil rights 
movement and participated in the selma ala march led by the rev 
martin luther king jr for a decade beginning in 1958 she worked in 
a public relations firm and beginning in 1968 she worked for sun 
oil cos public relations department ending her career there in 
1980 as a senior staff consultant 
that same year harris assumed the robes of an episcopal priest 
and began a career that took her to counseling sessions in state 
prisons and sermons in a city parish in 1984 harris became 
executive director of the episcopal church publishing co an 
organization not officially sanctioned by the church but one with a 
considerable voice through its publication the witness 
it was in the pages of this monthly magazine that harris became 
known to a wider audience through her regular editorials 
she wrote in opposition to south africas apartheid policies and 
to us aid to rebels in nicaragua she wrote in favor of gay rights 
and of an end to church discrimination against homosexuals and she 
lambasted conservative wings of the church on numerous occasions 
sometimes angering as much with her style as with the substance of 
her commentary 
in 1963 after three years of marriage harris divorced raymond 
rollins which also was cited by some critics 
harris has moved into an apartment in boston temporarily until 
her permanent assignment within the eastern massachusetts diocese is 
established her family has lived in the same home in philadelphia 
for 70 years so the move is a jolt for her 
she likes classical music and drinks an occasional glass of 
chablis she prefers any kind of gourmet food but she also 
likes soul food especially blackeyed peas i like cooking up a 
storm for a large crowd she said

lebanese captives are held by shiite extremists

president bush has approved 
continuing us military aid to the mujahadeen rebels resisting the 
sovietimposed government in afghanistan an administration 
spokesman said saturday 
deputy press secretary steve hart confirmed that bush had decided 
friday to continue helping the rebels 
the president met with his national security council hart 
said and reaffirmed us policy of continuing the flow of 
money arms and supplies to the rebels so long as the soviet union 
keeps sending aid to the kabul regime 
the new york times which initially reported the decision quoted 
senior administration officials as saying that despite the 
continuing soviet troop withdrawal from afghanistan the soviets 
have left behind large amounts of military hardware and sent in new 
military equipment 
it said the bush administration decision in effect means that 
the political goal of american policy in afghanistan now that the 
soviet troop withdrawal is virtually complete is to hasten the 
collapse of the kabul government 
bush spent a relaxed day here saturday taking a stroll and 
greeting townspeople during a brief shopping trip 
wearing a heavyduty naval flyer hat with flaps and carrying a 
walking stick bush walked through the town square stopping briefly 
chat with people and poking his stick in the air to make points the 
first couple braved temperatures in the 20s for the midday outing 
bush and his wife barbara appeared in the business district of 
this seacoast town around lunchtime midway through a quiet weekend 
of relaxation at their walkers point estate 
while mrs bush held their dog millie on a leash the president 
went into colonial pharmacy for a few moments asked what hed 
bought bush waved a paper bag and said a few razor blades 
thank you what a welcome he said just before jumping into a 
beige van for the short ride back to his vacation retreat 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said that bush had 
attended to routine paperwork in the morning and had made some phone 
calls 
bush did not take any questions from reporters during his walk 
through town and press aides declined to discuss a los angeles 
times report saying that former sen john tower had made conflicting 
statements about the nature of his role as a consultant to british 
aerospace 
the newspaper said that tower had told a congressional committee 
that he had given nonmilitary advice to british aerospace although 
he had said in a divorce deposition that he did consult the firm on 
militaryrelated matters 
we have no knowledge on that hart said its before the 
committee 
fitzwater asked to respond to criticism by congressional 
democrats about bushs failure to specify federal programs that will 
have to be cut in fiscal 1990 said only that he had talked to the 
president saturday he said hes still very pleased with the 
reaction to the budget the press secretary said 
asked if he would quarrel with assertions that bush failed to 
tell congress where he would cut the budget fitzwater replied 
dispute it were bragging about it thats what he wants to do 
get congress to help in cutting the budget 
bush on wednesday proposed a 116 trillion budget for the fiscal 
year that begins next oct 1 the document proposes several changes 
to the budget that ronald reagan submitted to congress on jan 9 
changes which principally reflected priorities that bush laid out 
during his campaign such as more spending on education 
environmental issues and such social problems as aids and the 
homeless 
fitzwater said that senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine has agreed to sit down with administration officials to 
work on a budget compromise 
we want to work out a budget the spokesman said were not 
going to speculate on courses of action we want to work it out 
the way it should be worked out which is to sit down with 
congress

a comatose woman on saturday underwent an 
abortion ordered by her husband in hopes of saving her life ending 
a twoweek legal fight with antiabortionists that reached the us 
supreme court 
its been a major battle i am tired and wounded i want to go 
on with my life martin klein said shortly after his wifes 
abortion no other family should ever have to go through what we 
have gone through 
nancy klein 32 remained comatose and was listed in guarded 
condition after the abortion but her vital signs were stable said 
spokeswoman carol hauptman of north shore university hospital a 
team of doctors including an expert on secondtrimester abortions 
handled the procedure she said mrs klein was 18 weeks pregnant 
we have one other hurdle to overcome and that is nancys 
recovery klein said i will live with this decision but the 
decision had to be mine 
mrs klein has been in a coma at the hospital since a dec 13 car 
accident 
klein said doctors told him that terminating his wifes pregnancy 
could give her a better chance of recovering so he asked a judge on 
jan 26 to declare him her legal guardian so he could authorize the 
abortion 
although a judge granted kleins request the ruling was 
challenged by righttolife advocates who appealed the decision at 
each court level until us supreme court justice thurgood marshall 
rejected their stay request friday 
klein 34 of upper brookville on long island quickly approved 
the abortion and the procedure was completed saturday morning 
although medical experts testified on kleins behalf that the 
abortion could help his wifes recovery ms hauptman said it was 
unclear what effect the abortion would have on mrs klein 
the two antiabortionists who had sought to be named mrs 
kleins guardian themselves said an abortion would threaten her 
emotional wellbeing 
abortions have been performed before on comatose pregnant women 
but never involving the same type of injury or coma ms hauptman 
said 
this is not only landmark legal terrain but also medical 
theres nothing in the medical literature like this ms hauptman 
said 
the operation ended two weeks of strain for klein and his family 
we are extremely relieved that the court battle is over and the 
operation went smoothly said anne zusselman of del ray beach 
fla mrs kleins mother 
now we are hopeful that nancys condition will improve and that 
we can move on to therapy for her mrs zusselman added she and 
her husband visit their daughter daily at the hospital 
prochoice advocate bill baird said the case was not about 
abortion rights 
this was an issue of husband and family rights not abortion 
baird said its a pity this family had to go through the pain and 
the suffering 
baird suggested klein sue antiabortion activists john short of 
farmingdale and john broderick of syosset for the anguish their 
extended legal efforts caused but klein said it was too soon to 
consider such a case 
this is the most tragic thing that ever could have happened 
short said saturday afternoon we tried very hard up to the last 
second we had a person standing on a phone at the hospital and one 
standing at a phone in washington but we couldnt do it 
short vowed to work to persuade the full us supreme court to 
hear the case in an effort to prevent such cases from happening 
again 
a halfdozen activists supporting a womans right to choose an 
abortion carried placards outside the hospital including one that 
read right to life your name is a lie you were willing to let 
nancy die 
several nassau county police cars were stationed at the hospital 
in case antiabortion activists staged any protest but none showed 
up

taking to the streets for a rally and roaring death to america 
men women and children braved snow and icy winds whistling down 
from the alborz mountains to attend the rally around the towering 
independence monument in freedom square 
a 10storyhigh portrait of iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini served as a backdrop 
president ali khamenei told the revelers their nation is ready 
for relations with every country that doesnt plot against us 
but a resolution read aloud said iran should never have ties with 
israel south africa and their godfather the great satan the 
iranian epithet for the united states 
the rally and others across iran marked the climax of 10 days of 
celebrations that began feb 1 the date in 1979 when khomeini 
returned to tehran in triumph after 15 years in exile 
ten days later the last government appointed by shah mohammad 
reza pahlavi collapsed khomeinis revolutionaries took power and 
proclaimed the islamic republic 
in november of that year fundamentalists took over the us 
embassy in tehran and held 52 americans hostage 444 days 
the revolution has survived bloody internal strife an eightyear 
war with iraq and the hostility of much of the world 
beneath the huge portrait of khomeini hoisted for the rally a 
slogan in farsi and english said the victory of the revolution 
needs safeguarding 
khomeini did not attend the rally which police estimated drew 3 
to 4 million people the 88yearold leader reportedly is in poor 
health and rarely leaves his home in north tehran 
he was represented by his son ahmed who is emerging as an 
increasingly powerful political figure 
khamenei speaking from a platform draped in blue and green 
streamers said the turnout was proof of iranians faith in the 
revolution and a warning to the world oppressor powers who 
conspire against the revolution 
today our revolution is stronger than ever despite the many 
obstacles placed in its way during the first 10 years by the 
oppressor powers he said 
cheerleader ali mozavardi known to iranians as the minister of 
slogans whipped the masses into a frenzy by leading them in his 
deep baritone voice in shouting antiamerican slogans 
iranians stabbed their fists in the air in time with their 
roaring chant of marg bar amrika or death to america 
the bearded khamenei speaking in a flat unemotional voice said 
there may be differences of opinion and taste between 
individuals in the iranian government but denied there was a 
power struggle 
nonetheless there have been clear signs of a split particularly 
since the aug 20 ceasefire in the iraniraq war 
one divisive issue is the campaign by parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani the most powerful figure after khomeini to normalize 
irans relations with western countries and end its selfimposed 
isolation 
the differences were illustrated last week when interior minister 
ali aakbar mohtashemi criticized a twoday visit to iran by french 
foreign minister roland dumas 
he said france was iraqs secondbiggest arms supplier after the 
soviet union during the war with iran instead of clasping the 
hands of such foreigners we should join hands with our people to get 
rid of foreigners mohtashemi said 
at the rally many women who stood separately from the men in 
accordance with religious code carried photographs of husbands or 
sons killed in the war 
there were hundreds of war veterans in wheelchairs or on 
crutches and one group was given a position of honor in front of 
the speakers platform 
khamenei said that although irans postwar reconstruction will 
depend mainly on iranians we also need the cooperation of those 
countries which are not motivated by plots or conspiracies against 
us 
the six wide avenues converging on freedom square were crammed 
with people after the rally one of the biggest in the capital in 
recent years 
sixteen helicopters including some identified by officials as 
iranianbuilt shabaviz craft showered the crowds with flowers and 
revolutionary leaflets

more than 1000 fishermen headed out onto 
frozen lake winnebago for the start of the sturgeon spearing season 
saturday despite warnings that the ice was unsafe 
authorities used a helicopter and a small airplane saturday to 
look for cracks 
no emergencies were reported in the first hours after the season 
opened at dawn the winnebago county sheriffs department said 
were just keeping our fingers crossed up here said a 
dispatcher who asked not to be identified 
signs posted along the west shore of the lake in the oshkosh area 
warn that the ice is hazardous and state department of natural 
resources officials warned early last week that conditions were 
unsafe on large areas of the lake 
martin wesenberg of the otter street fishing club said he had not 
seen conditions as bad since 1932 anyone who ventured onto the ice 
in the oshkosh area is crazy he said 
hundreds of shanties cars trucks and snowmobiles were in place 
by friday afternoon as fishermen prepared for the annual event 
wardens from the wisconsin department of natural resources said 
most of the fishermen were at the north end of the lake near 
neenah menasha and high cliff state park where the ice was 
believed to be thicker than in the oshkosh and fond du lac areas 
as recently as two weeks ago the lake had many open areas and 
authorities said at least a week of very cold weather was needed to 
make the ice safe 
fishermen were jubilant when belowzero temperatures hit the area 
last week and stayed for several days but authorities said a swift 
fox river current kept the ice from freezing uniformly and strong 
wind broke up the ice in many places 
the dnr said any strong wind between now and march 1 when the 
spearing season ends could cause the ice to break up stranding 
fishermen shanties and vehicles

us district judge alcee l hastings his 
impeachment trial in the us senate near has been on the road 
trying to rally support for what he concedes is a comefrombehind 
effort 
i have an uphill battle all the way hastings told 
listeners on a miami radio station talk show last week its going 
to be very difficult for me to extricate myself from this history 
demands that i try 
it was typical of the speaking appearances hes been making each 
week on radio shows and at churches colleges and civil rights 
groups 
with his senate trial expected to begin as early as midmarch 
hastings 52 has been urging listeners to write their senators to 
express interest in his case and contribute to his legal defense 
fund 
although the judge is often warmly received he has raised only 
4000 he unsuccessfully asked for government help for his defense 
expenses saying the justice department has spent 2 million for a 
witch hunt or fishing expedition against him 
hastings became the first black federal judge from florida when 
he was appointed by thenpresident carter in 1979 
he marked another less happy first last august when he became 
the only person ever to be impeached after he was already cleared of 
similar charges in a criminal trial the house vote to impeach or 
send the case to the senate for trial was 4133 
he is accused of conspiring with a former friend attorney 
william a borders to reduce a sentence of two convicted 
racketeers and of lying and fabricating his defense during his 1983 
criminal trial though hastings was acquitted in that trial borders 
was convicted of bribery conspiracy in a separate trial 
last month the senate rules committee dealt hastings another 
setback by deciding his trial would be largely conducted by a 
12member special committee before the full senate votes on whether 
to convict a twothirds majority would result in hastings removal 
from the bench 
on friday hastings attorney terence j anderson a university of 
miami law professor said he would file challenges to the rules 
committee decision along with motions to dismiss the 17 articles of 
impeachment 
he contends that hastings is unconstitutionally being tried twice 
for the same case because of the criminal trial supporters of the 
impeachment answer that just because a charge is not proven beyond a 
reasonable doubt to a jurys satisfaction does not mean that a judge 
is fit to stay on the bench 
the defense also argues that congress and the justice department 
may be trying to influence judicial independence through coercion 
hastings says the racial question bears on his troubles but is 
not the only cause 
im not going to go up to the beltway and say leave me alone 
because im black hastings said but he usually adds i do not 
believe i would be in this situation if i were not black 
he says he was targeted by a federal sting operation in 1981 
because of his liberal record on the bench particularly his strong 
opposition to justice department deportations of haitian aliens 
judicial colleagues acted against him because he wasnt a 
member of the club and because many of the reagan ideologues 
want to keep the minorities and women appointed during the carter 
administration in check he argued 
hastings called the overwhelming house vote rank politics 
rep larry smith a hollywood fla democrat and longtime 
political ally of hastings said he voted for impeachment even 
though such a vote was unlikely to help him politically he said he 
looked over the evidence carefully and felt he had no choice 
smith pointed out though that the impeachment was more like an 
indictment and doesnt mean he presumes hastings is guilty 
hastings reflected that his place in the history of the civil 
rights movement would be determined by the trials outcome 
i may be considered a visionary someone who fought the odds 
he said or i could be remembered only for being removed from the 
bench

on it and 3500 a sculpture that once belonged to the late 
actordirector 
im going to get something said ellen hart 70 who cowered 
in a pennsylvania farmhouse in 1938 as the aliens in welles 
frighteningly realistic radio play war of the worlds drew 
closer i want a piece of a man who gave us so many memories 
more than 550 items from welles hollywood estate went on the 
block at a threeday auction that began friday at cb charles

everything said owner cb charles who purchased the items last

sculpture of a russian soldier on horseback sold for 3500 
a working pocket watch went for 260 a broken one went for 140 
a french postcard with welles face on it signed by welles himself 
went for 180 
we really came here just for a glimpse of what welles was like 
as a man said tom black of miami looking at what people own is 
such an insight into what they were really like 
welles directed or acted in more than 60 films and won an oscar 
for screenwriting for citizen kane loosely based on the life of 
newspaper tycoon william randolph hearst 
susan grimes parents were children when welles fooled the nation 
with war of the worlds but the mystique of the event was still 
strong for her 
its part of american lore said grimes 34 it will be a 
long time before we forget orson welles

workmen cleaning a heavily traveled tourist 
area of a fabled temple stumbled across an ancient hoard of statues 
of pharaohs and gods a discovery that researchers called a 
potential gold mine of historical data 
officials said five statutes so far have been dug up inside the 
famous luxor temple in luxor a nile river city about 450 miles 
south of cairo 
there are other statues still buried and only small parts of 
them are showing sayed tawfik chairman of the egyptian 
antiquities organization we will know more when we dig them up 
he said he expects the statues to represent leaders and deities 
from a 750year period that ended about 500 bc shortly before the 
persians conquered egypt 
displaying the find to president hosni mubarak on friday 
egyptologist aly hassan described it as the most important of the 
end of the 20th century 
notable from the first half of the century are the discovery of 
the tomb of pharaoh tutankhamun across the nile river from luxor in 
1922 a fabulous golden trove found in the nile delta at tanis in 
1939 and a dismantled fullsize boat found beside the 
4600yearold pyriamid of pharaoh cheops in 1954 
hassan said the luxor temple discovery turned up by chance on 
jan 22 during routine cleaning of an area at the western end of the 
temples amenhophis iii courtyard rimmed by towering and majestic 
columns 
three of the five statues found so far have been identified he 
said 
one is an 8foot quartzite statue of pharaoh amenhophis iii who 
ruled egypt in 13911353 bc and founded the existing luxor temple 
the others are lifesized or larger 
another statue 5feet long and made of black diorite depicts 
the cowheaded goddess hathor guardian of women beauty and love 
the third identified statue made of granite is of general 
haremhab a soldier who usurped the egyptian throne at the end of 
the 18th dynasty after tutankhamun and his caretaker aya died 
he said the amenhophis iii statue became visible as workers were 
cleaning 
nobody expected such a find because the area is visited by so 
many tourists each day hassan said 
until friday the cache remained covered and under guard 
antiquities officials debated whether excavating the relics would 
damage the fragile temple and jeopardize the stability of columns 
luxor temple an island of stone beauty beside the nile is 
considered the most endangered monument in the luxor area 
undermined by a rising water table and a river of sewage water 
flowing beneath it 
during its construction the temple underwent continual changes 
and additions including changes ordered by tutankhamun ramses ii 
and alexander the great 
after the reign of amenhophis iii ancient egypts religion 
underwent major upheaval when his son and successor akhenaten 
ordered that a new god aten be given precedence over the existing 
array of deities his agents hacked the name of amun the 
longfavored god of thebes from monuments throughout egypt 
the new discoveries give evidence of the turbulence as the name 
amun was chiseled from amenhophiss statue egyptian officials said 
the cache surely will yield historical data from the period of 
religious frenzy and violence 
antiquities officials said the statues probably were hidden by 
temple priests 
we can expect to find such caches from time to time said 
zahi hawass archaeological adviser to the culture minister and 
director of giza plateau we think these objects were buried by 
priests trying to hide them during periods when strife was occurring 
throughout the country

thousands of people marched peacefully 
on saturday and demanded that the new regime postpone the may 1 
elections so the opposition will have time to launch an effective 
campaign 
the people demand an authentic democracy and not a mere 
facade shouted domingo laino leader of the authentic radical 
liberal party believed to be the largest opposition group 
the rally in downtown ascuncion followed by nine days the coup 
led by gen andres rodriguez who toppled the government of former 
dictator alfredo stroessner stroessner had ruled for nearly 35 
years 
rodriguez dissolved congress promised democracy and called 
elections for may 1 
but opposition leaders said the election has been called too 
soon they argue that voter lists are outdated and that some groups 
never have been able to participate in elections 
opposition figures say the official colorado party which has 
held power for 42 years is too rich and wellentrenched to be 
effectively challenged at the polls on such short notice 
radio stations said the chanting flagwaving crowd at the plaza 
of the heroes ranged from 50000 to 60000 people witnesses placed 
the number closer to 10000 
this is the first time since i was 16 years old that ive 
attended a political rally said elsa benitez rodado for the 
last 30 years only they colorados have been able to demonstrate 
all we got were beatings 
atilio avelos a 42yearold farmer said he traveled from the 
city of colonel oviedo 87 miles east of the capital to 
demonstrate that this new opening to democracy is for the benefit 
of all the people we have to be a single family 
police under stroessner refused to authorize demonstrations that 
might be construed as antigovernment and violently broke up those 
that were held anyway on saturday the few police that were present 
directed traffic 
rodriguez government authorized the rally and one of the 
capitals two television stations broadcast it live 
vendors sold ice cream and soft drinks from hand carts 
official and unofficial delegations represented the united 
states argentina brazil uruguay venezuela and taiwan 
at this historic moment we wish to express our hope that the 
paraguayan people may find though peaceful dialogue the road to a 
new era of justice and liberty the us delegation said in a 
communique the group included former arizona gov bruce babbitt and 
the former ambassador to paraguay robert white 
the rally was staged by the national accord a loose grouping of 
four opposition parties of which laino is president he said he 
spoke friday night with new interior minister orlando machuca 
vargas and would submit opposition demands in writing on monday 
in addition to the postponing elections the opposition seeks 
changes in election laws that would permit several parties to unite 
behind a single candiate which now is prohibited and new voter 
lists to replace current fraudulent ones 
some marchers saturday were skeptical of the new regimes 
response to their demands 
its not convenient for the government to give the opposition 
time to organize said maria mercedes ramirez a pretty 
23yearold secretary and student

the government said saturday that 
a vatican report condemning apartheid misrepresents south africas 
racial policies 
the foreign affairs department in a statement said it had not 
received a copy of the full 45page vatican document released 
earlier in the day but was issuing a preliminary response based on 
news reports 
on the basis of what is known to us the document 
misrepresents south african government policy clearly restated by 
the newly elected leader of the governing party in his first 
parliamentary statement in that capacity last week the department 
said 
it referred to education minister fw de klerk recently elected 
to replace ailing president pw botha as leader of the national 
party 
in a speech wednesday de klerk called for an end to 
whiteminority domination and racial prejudice although he 
reaffirmed the governments commitment to segregation and made no 
mention of establishing black voting rights 
the vatican document called apartheid institutionalized racism 
justified by an ideology of the superiority of persons from 
european stock over those of african or indian origin 
today apartheid is the most marked and systematic form of 
racism the document said change is absolutely necessary and 
urgent 
french cardinal roger etchegaray head of the vatican commission 
that prepared the document said he went last year to south africa 
where 5 million whites hold political power while 26 million blacks 
have no vote in national affairs 
the foreign affairs department without mentioning etchegaray 
said the government finds it regrettable that a statement has been 
made on such a complex and difficult issue without the vatican 
leadership having been to south africa to assess for themselves the 
situation here 
the department nevertheless appreciates the reports 
condemnation of violence and its advocacy of communication and 
consultation as a method of resolving problems the government 
added 
the vatican document entitled the church and racism towards a 
more fraternal society said racism should be combatted through 
nonviolent means 
the application of legislative disciplinary and administrative 
measures or even appropriate external pressure can be timely 
but without going so far as to replace violently one unjust 
situation with another injustice it said 
pope john paul ii has said conditions are not ripe for a papal 
visit to south africa although his plane was forced to land there 
because of bad weather during a trip to other southern african 
nations last year there have been unconfirmed reports in south 
africa that the pope might visit in 1990

poor quality merchandise can be seized from a firm if a court 
agrees says the proposed law which was submitted for nationwide 
discussion by the supreme soviet presidium the governments top 
executive body 
delays in meeting contracts for furnishing goods or services a

the rev barbara harris with the voices of 
dissidents overwhelmed by cheers from thousands of fellow 
episcopalians on saturday became the first woman elevated to bishop 
in a 2000year succession dating back to the apostles 
harris was greeted with a roar of approval from about 8000 
people when she walked down the aisle for a consecration that has 
drawn world attention because of her gender background and liberal 
views 
she was faulted by a conservative church member who said in a 
brief speech that her elevation would be a sacrilege but when the 
chief consecrator the most rev edmond browning asked the 
congregation if it was their will that harris be ordained they 
thundered out that is our will 
i will obey christ and serve in his name harris said 
men and women now stand together before god in todays world 
a world that needs that first bishop david johnson of the boston 
episcopal diocese said before the consecration held in a convention 
center to accommodate the crowd 
beginning with a solemn procession and culminating in the laying 
on of bishops hands and the placing of a pointed bishops miter on 
her head harris assumed the relatively minor position of suffragan 
or assistant bishop in the boston episcopal diocese 
harris said after her consecration that it put a tremendous 
amount of responsibility on her shoulders 
that responsibility includes encouraging young people to press 
on and overcome barriers and to hang in there harris said adding 
that she intended to do just that 
after the ceremony she said she would try to reach out to her 
opponents and others to try to allay their fears we will be in 
contact we will do that to the best of our abilities she said 
just say im very proud and very happy thats all said 
harris mother beatrice harris 
the 58yearold former publisher of a liberal episcopal 
publication is the first woman consecrated a bishop in any of the 
three major branches of christianity roman catholicism eastern 
orthodoxy and anglicanism which includes the episcopal church 
that consider bishops successors to jesus apostles 
her selection touched off monthslong debate within the church 
opponents included traditionalists who believe that because the 
apostles were men the position of bishop must be reserved for men 
others objected to harris because of her lack of a college degree 
and formal seminary training and because of her relative 
inexperience in parish ministerial work still others objected to 
her strongly liberal writings on gay rights us policy in central 
america and internal church matters 
harris who is black said she believes that some of the 
opposition to her elevation stemmed from her race as well as her sex 
but by last month her election was confirmed by a majority 118 
episcopal dioceses across the country 
as a result of the intense debate saturdays rites drew network 
television coverage and a live local television audience 
during a period in the ceremony allotted for protest john 
jamieson of evanston ill chairman of the conservative prayer book 
societys chicago chapter appealed to browning presiding bishop of 
the episcopal church in the united states 
bishop browning please weigh the consequences by proceeding 
with this pretended consecration you will perpetuate a sacrilegious 
imposture you will abandon the communion of all those churches 
descended from the church of england and you will destroy the 
concept of legality in the episcopal church jamieson said 
browning received a standing ovation after saying that harris 
consecration was in accordance with church laws 
a 1976 vote by episcopal bishops cleared the way for saturdays 
consecration by approving the ordination of women as priests harris 
became a priest in 1980 one of about 1200 women ordained 
harris election last september by members of the boston 
episcopal diocese also touched off debate from other denominations 
that bar women from the priesthood 
cardinal bernard law of bostons roman catholic archdiocese 
declined an invitation to attend the ceremony and said in a 
statement that the consecration of harris has serious ecumenical 
implications because it departs from a common tradition in regard to 
sacramental orders 
the episcopal church an offshoot of the church of england was 
established in 1784 following the revolutionary war it is one of 27 
member churches of the anglican communion grouped under though not 
governed by the anglican church 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie leader of the worldwide 
anglican communion and spiritual head of the church of england 
which bars ordination of women wrote to the episcopal church on 
saturday to say he would pray for the church 
we are deeply conscious that not every anglican will yet feel 
able to acknowledge her as a bishop of the church runcie said in 
his message which was released to the press in england 
other anglicans in england held prayer services of support 
saturday and two members of the church of england came to boston to 
present harris with letters of support 
the church of england broke with the roman catholic church in 
1534 during the reign of king henry viii despite the break 
anglicanism and later the episcopal church maintained many roman 
catholic rites and traditions including the concept of a direct 
succession of bishop dating back to the apostles 
the word episcopal itself refers to a church governed by bishops 
rather than a pope or central archbishop a 1985 survey counted 
7858 parishes and some 29 million members bostons diocese is 
among the larger in the nation with 190 parishes and 96000 members 
in the eastern half of the state

the proliferation of harbor dinner cruises 
overnight fishing trips whalewatching excursions booze 
cruises and commuter ferries coupled with a series of accidents 
has led the coast guard to propose new safety standards for small 
passenger vessels 
written after a 1951 charter boat collision off long island left 
56 dead the small passenger safety law has remained largely 
unchanged since 1963 while a multitude of new uses has sprung up 
says coast guard cmdr william cummins 
the boats defined as carrying more than six passengers and 
displacing less than 100 gross tons used to be predominately for 
day fishing trips and small ferry boats 
most of todays vessels are much bigger than the boats of the 
1950s and 1960s and often are carry hundreds and in several cases 
thousands of passengers cummins said 
uses include highspeed passenger ferries harbor taxies dinner 
cruises whalewatching and other tour boats the popular booze 
cruise floating parties and chartered fishing trips that extend 
for days at a time 
ocean liners large ferry boats and other vessels more than 100 
gross tons fall under separate rules and already face tougher safety 
standards 
proposed new requirements include improved lifesaving equipment 
radar and electronic positionfixing equipment for certain new 
vessels as well as public address systems for all new vessels and 
existing vessels with more than one passenger deck 
emergency lighting on vessels more than 65 feet fire 
extinguishing systems for enclosed machinery spaces fire pumps 
capable of remote operation smoke detectors on certain vessels 
passenger manifests and mandatory public safety announcements are 
also on the list 
in addition wooden boats or vessels operating in salt water 
would have to go into drydock every two years for repairs and 
inspection 
the national transportation safety board has long pushed for an 
overhaul of the small passenger vessel regulations 
michael benson an ntsb spokesman said the coast guards 
proposed rules certainly go in the right direction 
the board has felt and recommended for some time that the 
changes are needed because the old rules are inadequate he said 
whether the new rules go as far as the board would like well only 
know after an evaluation which has just begun 
industry representatives said they too are still analyzing the 
proposals and their potential impact 
as businessmen theyre prosafety but i dont think theyve 
been able to assess what the government regulations will mean to 
them individually said peter lauridsen a technical consultant 
for the national association of passenger vessel owners 
the proposals would cost the industry about 85 million a year 
the coast guard estimate released jan 30 they are subject to 120 
days of public comments cumins said he does not expect the final 
rules to be adopted until mid1990

the leader of salvadors leftist rebel movement 
says in an article released saturday his group is far more moderate 
than is widely believed and seeks a new system that is open 
flexible pluralistic and democratic 
joaquin villalobos commander of the farabundo marti national 
liberation front said the revolutionary government he is fighting 
for should avoid confrontation with the united states because el 
salvadors ties to it are stronger than those his country has 
elsewhere 
villalobos outlined his views in an article in foreign policy 
magazine which described it as his first comprehensive statement 
for an englishlanguage publication 
the reagan administration spent an average of well over 100 
million a year in military aid to el salvador to prevent a takeover 
of that country by villalobos and his followers seeing them as 
intent on establishing a marxist state with strong ties to cuba and 
the soviet union 
the prevailing view in administration has been that the 
salvadoran rebels are far more radical than the insurgency in 
nicaragua which seized power nine years ago 
but villalobos wrote that it is neither possible nor 
necessary in el salvador to eliminate totally the private 
sector establish a singleparty system bar other parties from the 
media break with the church or eliminate elections 
the fmln he said pursues an el salvador that is open 
flexible pluralistic and democratic in both the economic and 
political spheres 
with presidential elections set for next month el salvador is 
entering a crucial stage the fmln recently moved away from its 
support of a peaceful settlement based on power sharing to one of 
support under certain conditions for the existing electoral 
process 
although no agreement has been reached with the govenrment 
villalobos called the proposal a final effort to avoid a social 
explosion 
rejecting the cuban model which emphasizes total state control 
over the economy villalobos said a combination of the private and 
public sectors can lead to more rapid development of salvadoran 
society than a supposedly more radical and closed model 
further emphasizing his preference for pragmatic policies 
villalobos said an ideological approach is of no use if it does 
not resolve the problems of poverty but el salvador cannot develop 
if the united states does not understand its situation and drives it 
to develop a war economy 
he also called for freedom of expression 
through debate and education the masses can learn why they 
should defend their historic achievement the revolution itself 
he said but this knowledge cannot be developed without 
opposition without an understanding of the oppositions point of 
view 
he added that to promote debate professional journalism that 
is both independent and critical is fundamental 
there was no immediate comment by the state department on 
villalobos article but shortly before returning to private life 
last month elliott abrams former assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs said he expected that the salvadoran rebels 
would expand efforts to influence public opinion in the united 
states 
he said the sandinista government in nicaragua was able to 
influence congress last year to suspend aid to the contra rebels and 
he predicted a similar attempt by the fmln to persuade the lawmakers 
to reduce aid to the salvadoran government 
a recent state department report said there has been a steady 
increase in fmln assassinations kidnapings use of 
pressuredetonated mines that kill and maim indiscriminately 
it said that guerrilla mines killed 39 people and injured more 
than 130 in the first nine months of 1988

foodpoisoning scares involving chicken eggs 
butter and popular precooked dinners have left millions of britons 
baffled and preoccupied with what they can and cannot eat 
since december when a government health minister said most of 
britains egg production was infected with salmonella the debate 
over the risk of eating various foods has gained momentum 
public anxiety has been aroused partly by news media attention 
and frontpage headlines such as cheese can kill your baby in 
saturdays tabloid the sun and partly by confusing data from 
officials 
the average consumer is punchdrunk with warnings and 
statistics many of which seem contradictory said the normally 
progovernment daily express on saturday 
during the weekend britons faced a triple food scare 
salmonellainfected chickens and eggs mercurycontaminated butter 
and soft cheeses precooked meals and fresh fruits and vegetables 
contaminated by listeria bacteria 
the department of health on saturday denied a frontpage story in 
the liberal guardian newspaper that claimed the government was 
delaying publication of a report into another scare the 
possibility that meat products from cattle infected with a brain 
virus could trigger the same disease in humans 
the report will be published soon and there is no health risk 
because milk and meat from such animals is being destroyed the 
government said 
with public concern mounting prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservative government announced friday a committee to investigate 
all aspects of food safety 
the agriculture department on friday ordered farmers to slaughter 
all salmonellainfected chickens the disease can be fatal to the 
elderly and very young 
also friday the governments chief medical officer sir donald 
acheson warned pregnant women not to eat soft cheeses which could 
be contaminated by listeria bacteria and urged that precooked meals 
be reheated to prevent listeria contamination 
a ministry of agriculture spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity said saturday that a ban would be imposed on 
unpasteurized milk pasteurization kills some bacteria and delays 
the development of others 
meanwhile dairy crest britains largest butter producer called 
in police and recalled all cornishbrand butter after a container 
was found to be contaminated by mercury the company said saturday 
there was no risk of harm to humans 
robin cook the opposition labor partys health spokesman 
welcomed formation of the investigative committee and achesons 
recommendations but said i would be more impressed if the 
guidance to the public was accompanied by regulations on the food 
industry to get at the root of the problem 
even the prime ministers staunchest newspaper supporters 
expressed doubt the governments actions would quell public anxiety 
the problem which the spate of recent food scandals has 
brought into focus is the tendency of government departments to 
mirror producer interests at the public expense the prothatcher 
daily mail said in an editorial saturday 
the financial times the respected conservative financial daily 
echoed this assessment saying the government had been inept and 
unable to reconcile the interests of egg producers represented by 
the ministry of agriculture with those of consumers who ended up 
with no voice 
what we need the daily mail said is a separate whitehall 
government department corresponding to the food and drug 
administration in the united states to safeguard the people against 
the farmers wholesalers and retailers failures and sins 
but geoffrey cannon secretary of the guild of food writers 
wrote in the daily telegraph on saturday that the publics demand 
for inexpensive massproduced food had led to the current health 
scares 
the truth is that the severe outbreak of salmonella poisoning 
is caused by our demand for cheap eggs if we want cheap eggs 
we will get mass production by methods that must heighten the risk 
of disease if we want safe eggs we must be prepared to pay more 
as with eggs so with chickens he said

two men have been convicted in the 1987 
slaying of a teenager who they mistakenly accused of raping the 
80yearold grandmother of one of the men 
a tarrant county jury deliberated less than 40 minutes friday 
before convicting norris wayne hicks and boyd ballard of murder in 
the nov 27 1987 shooting of jeffery donnelle who died eight days 
later 
its a shame because he donnelle wasnt guilty said terri 
moore in closing arguments this 17yearold kid absolutely died 
for nothing 
after donnelles death police determined his blood type did not 
match the blood type of the person who raped the elderly woman no 
one has been charged in the rape 
the jury will return monday to set punishment for hicks 36 of 
nearby arlington and ballard 35 of alabama they face sentences 
of five to 99 years or life in prison 
during the threeday trial witnesses testified that donnelle was 
killed because the two defendants were under the impression that 
donnelle had raped ballards grandmother 
a stepdaughter of hicks testified that the 80yearold woman had 
identified donnelle as her attacker from a television news report 
and a photograph 
defense attorneys argued unsuccessfully that prosecution 
witnesses were doing the same thing that the two men had done 
mistakenly identifying them as killers 
hicks wife ruby nell gay hicks faces a charge of conspiracy to 
commit murder in connection with the same case

the united states has warned the 
palestine liberation organization against attacking israeli military 
or civilian targets but is not ready to break off talks with yasser 
arafats group over a clash in southern lebanon secretary of state 
james a baker iii said saturday 
launching a weeklong trip to 14 west european capitals baker 
said he had not decided whether an incident a week ago means the plo 
has reneged on arafats pledge renouncing terrorism in the 
confrontation israeli forces intercepted and killed five guerillas 
who were carrying identification papers linking them to two factions 
of the plo 
the pledge and the statement by the palestinian leader accepting 
israels right to exist prompted the reagan administration last 
december to open talks with the plo after a 13year official ban 
we are not prepared at this time to say this constitutes action 
by the plo to cause us to break off the dialogue baker said on a 
flight from ottawa canada where he opened us consultations with 
north atlantic treaty organization members on friday 
but baker said robert pelletreau the us ambassador to 
tunisia had informed plo officials there that the clash last 
weekend was the kind of action that presents us with great 
difficulty 
in fact baker said we made the point that actions such as 
this directed against civilians or military targets inside or 
outside of israel were something that gave us trouble 
the us decision to talk to the plo boosted arafats standing in 
the international community since then he has gained increased 
support from west european governments 
israel meanwhile sharply disagreed with the us decision 
after the clash israeli leaders said the five guerillas four 
palestinians and a lebanese had tried to infiltrate israel to 
carry out a terrorist raid 
israeli ambassador moshe arad complained to baker on wednesday in 
washington and said the incident showed the plo had not changed its 
tactics despite arafats pledge 
baker said terrorism was one of the issues he intended to discuss 
with the 14 foreign ministers he will see on his european tour 
baker said he hoped to encourage a collective approach but 
that he would not foreclose unilateral retaliation 
the united states bombed tripoli libya in 1986 in what was 
described by the reagan administration as retaliation for libyan 
involvement in a terrorist attack on a west german nightclub 
frequented by americans 
baker met for nearly two hours in iceland with foreign minister 
john baldvin hannibalsson 
he then flew to london for meetings sunday with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher and sir geoffrey howe the british 
foreign secretary 
baker said the nato alliance was extraordinary important to 
the bush administration as it shapes its foreign policy 
we want them to be in on the takeoff so they can be in on the 
landing with respect to policy formulation as this administration 
gets started he said in an airborne news conference 
baker again rejected any suggestion the administration was 
footdragging in dealing with the soviet union on arms control and 
other issues 
he said an ongoing review of ussoviet relations could prompt 
some us policy changes but gave no specific examples 
on a related issue he confirmed he would meet an early march 
with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in vienna as 
nato and the warsaw pact open negotiations on reducing nonnuclear 
forces in europe 
baker said the bush administration had not decided when to resume 
negotiations with the soviets to reduce longrange nuclear weapons 
the reagan administration had decided tentatively on next wednesday

the captain of a luxury liner that sliced a disabled 
cuban freighter in two said saturday his crew was not at fault in 
the predawn collision that left three cuban crewmen missing 
the cruise ship celebration arrived home in miami on saturday as 
federal transportation officials the coast guard and its insurer 
lloyds of london questioned the crew about the friday morning 
collision off cuba 
despite an 18inch gash and black scrape marks on its bow the 
734foot cruise ship sustained only minor damage and none of its 
1500 passengers or 600 crewmembers was injured a carnival cruise 
lines spokesman said 
capt rafaele gravino master of the celebration said the 
350foot cuban vessel the capitan san luis was drifting without 
lights or steering in a major shipping channel and made no effort to 
warn his crew of the impending collision 
the fault is with the ship that had no lights said gravino 
but the helmsman of the cuban vessel said saturday his captain 
tried to warn the celebration and maneuver to avoid the accident 
reported prensa latina cubas official news agency 
we signaled the other ship to let us maneuver and tried to 
change course to avoid an accident said ramon lahera whose right 
leg was amputated after the collision 
prensa latina said lahera remains hospitalized in holguin in 
eastern cuba and the search continues for the captain and two other 
lost crewmen 
gravino also said his crew was not to be blamed for failing to 
check radar for 27 minutes prior to the accident 
when there is no visibility the radar is checked very 
frequently but when there is good visibility you are supposed to 
see the lights of the other ship gravino said during a news 
conference aboard the ship 
his crew didnt see the cement hauler until they were 300 feet 
apart he said his officers threw the engines into reverse but it 
was too late to avoid slamming into the disabled freighter 
the cuban crew told their rescuers that the freighter had lost 
electrical power but carnival spokesman tim gallagher said they 
still could have warned passing ships of its plight 
when you do not have emergency lights you can still raise oil 
lamps use the radio or shoot flare guns he said 
gravino quickly left the news conference to meet with 
investigators from the national transportation safety board which 
has conducted a series of hearings in miami on cruise line safety 
ntsb officials said they were looking into the incident even 
though it involved a liberianregistered cruise liner and a cuban 
freighter en route from havana to the canary islands 
a crew from the coast guards marine safety office judged the 
vessel to be seaworthy and it set sail saturday afternoon on another 
weeklong trip to the caribbean gallagher said 
the celebrations crew rescued 42 of the 45 cuban crew members 
the coast guard said the surviving sailors were picked up by a 
cuban navy frigate and tug and 13 were hospitalized in cuba prensa

the justice department asked the supreme court 
on saturday to delay former white house aide oliver norths 
irancontra trial citing a danger he would divulge too many 
national security secrets 
proceeding with the trial on those terms will make it 
impossible for the attorney general to fulfill his responsibility to 
safeguard classified information the department said in asking 
for a stay 
independent counsel lawrence walsh who is prosecuting north 
urged the supreme court to reject the justice departments request 
saying the department has no legal authority to seek a delay 
walsh said the attorney general comes before this court in an 
attempt to assume a role that the ethics in government act and his 
own independent counsel regulation deny him that of prosecutor in 
this case 
the independent counsel called the justice department request an 
eleventhhour application and said the department has sought 
to interfere in this trial at the final hour 
a jury was chosen thursday in norths trial on 12 felony charges 
stemming from the irancontra affair and us district judge 
gerhard a gesell has asked the jurors to report to the courtroom 
monday 
it was not clear when the supreme court was likely to act on the 
justice department request 
the justice department appealed to the supreme court after a 
threejudge federal appeals panel on friday for the second time in 
as many days refused to delay the start of norths trial 
department officials say that if the delay is denied attorney 
general dick thornburgh is prepared to act under the classified 
information procedures act to file an affidavit objecting to 
disclosure by north of some classified information that step could 
result in dismissal of some or all criminal charges against north 
under cipa once the attorney general files an affidavit the 
court must order north not to disclose the classified information at 
issue even though it is relevant material tending to prove his 
innocence dismissal of charges likely would follow on grounds that 
north would not be given a fair trial 
the department criticized the judge in the case for not reining 
in norths plans to use extensive amounts of classified material 
no order of the district court prohibits defendant north in 
his opening statement or during the governments case from simply 
disclosing without seeking prior court approval classified 
information that falls outside eight categories identified by 
gesell last wednesday said the justice departments 19page court 
filing 
even as to information within those categories no order 
prohibits defendant north from disclosing classified information 
during his own case it added 
gesell issued orders dec 12 and jan 19 spelling out how much 
censorship could be applied to classified material that the 
prosecution and defense planned to use at trial 
the categories of information covered by the two orders were by 
no means exhaustive said the justice department much 
classified information remained unprotected and was not the subject 
of any pretrial ruling on admissibility 
the department wants to delay the trial so additional steps can 
be taken to bar north from disclosing classified material 
walsh disagreed with the departments assessment saying he 
believes that all areas of concern to the intelligence agencies 
have been adequately covered by the district courts orders 
the independent counsel said that during seven months of cipa 
proceedings he has asked intelligence agencies to enumerate which 
specific classified information could never be disclosed at trial 
and then took action accordingly to protect the secrets 
walsh has largely cooperated with intelligence agencies in trying 
to resolve problems involving classified material 
on wednesday the justice department and walsh parted company so 
abruptly that walshs staff reportedly had almost no warning that 
the department was going to court on its own 
the problems began jan 19 when gesell issued an order that would 
permit north to introduce without a prior court order classified 
information tending to show that his intent was not to violate the 
law 
intelligence agencies were concerned over the freedom the order 
gave north to present a broad array of classified material 
as an alternative the government asked gesell to require the 
defense to provide advance notice or get a court order before 
disclosing classified information gesell rejected that proposal 
jan 30 
the justice department on wednesday asked for a court order 
barring disclosure of classified material as long as a government 
objection was pending walsh however asked gesell to impose no 
more than the restrictions that already apply to prosecutors

the yacht thursdays child zigzagging north 
against strong headwinds should arrive in san francisco bay on 
sunday to beat by eight days the new yorksan francisco speed record 
set 135 years ago a spokeswoman said saturday 
it will be the early morning said sylvia wilkerson a 
shorebased spokeswoman for the threeman crew they just want to 
get in 
since nov 23 the 10ton racing yacht has logged some 15000 
miles in a voyage around dreaded cape horn off the tip of south 
america the period included a stop at the falkland islands to make 
repairs after the boat collided with an unknown object 
in the past seven years five other racing boats have been sunk 
rounding cape horn in futile attempts to beat the record set by the 
clipper ship flying cloud in 1854 new york to san francisco in 89 
days eight hours 
saturday afternoon an airplane with an associated press reporter 
and photographer aboard spotted thursdays child about 10 miles 
southwest of santa cruz and 75 miles from the golden gate the yacht 
was moving almost due north at 8 to 10 knots in about 15 knots of 
wind 
the crew skipperowner warren luhrs 44 courtney hazleton 32 
and lars bergstrom 54 who helped design the hightech vessel 
were in for a welcome from hundreds of boats at the finish under the 
golden gate bridge 
the news earlier saturday was not so good shifting winds had 
dropped to a slight breeze overnight as the boat struggled to 
progress north at midnight the boat was making only 7 knots less 
than 9 mph 
although tired from the constant tacking which requires the crew 
to leap from one side of the cockpit to the other to manipulate the 
sail as the boat zigzags northward the crew was well wilkerson was 
hazleton talking over the radio one day last week called the 
adventure some of the finest sailing i ever had i would do it 
again at the drop of a hat 
but it was with awe and respect for the power of the sea that he 
recalled the boats navigation of cape horn which is always torn by 
roaring winds 
it got pretty bad very unpleasant hazelton said he said 
the vessel spent six days and nights sailing into the teeth of winds 
gusting to 60 knots through seas that raged against the boat from 
all directions 
the clipper flying cloud a merchantman that also ferried gold 
rush adventurers to san francisco could lay on 35 sails on its tall 
masts it was the fastest of thousands of sailing clippers that 
raced each other across the atlantic and pacific 
ironically the ships recordsetting performance in 1854 
coincided with the beginning of the end of this countrys sailing 
commerce in that year us shipbuilders quit clipper construction 
because freight rates had dropped and the oak that went into the 
ships became too expensive 
steam sealed the doom of the clippers and the rocks off st 
johns newfoundland did likewise to the flying cloud in 1874 
nothing is left of it

party chief karoly grosz said saturday 
that the communist party leadership has endorsed a multiparty 
system but would continue to reassess a key chapter in hungarys 
history the 1956 antisoviet revolt 
the central committee split between socialist hardliners and 
reformers ended a special twoday session aimed primarily at 
assessing the emotionally and politically significant revolt 
grosz who has said previously that a multiparty system in 
hungary is likely next year told hungarian radio that the party 
has taken a stand that it accepts takes note of and endorses a 
multiparty system 
but the length and secrecy of the meeting indicated the party was 
split over plans to share power with other parties and a host of 
other reforms 
fifteen of the alternative political movements founded in recent 
months said monday they would not enter a coalition with the 
communists as some communist party reformers desire unless the 
party revises its view of 1956 
earlier party spokesman emil kimmel told hungarian radio the 
various platforms within the 108member central committee 
sought unity on the fundamental issues indicating a split 
the central committee meeting was called after politburo reformer 
imre pozsgay shocked hungarians by terming the 1956 revolt a 
popular uprising it had been referred to for more than three 
decades years as a counterrevolution 
a source insisting on anonymity said saturday the party had 
compromised on a new official view of 1956 
a central committee member gyula horn hinted at a possible 
compromise friday by saying the revolt may have started as a popular 
uprising but turned into something which could be termed a 
counterrevolution 
but grosz said the party would continue to discuss the revolt 
but he too suggested saturday that it began not as a revolt 
against the socialist system but that counterrevolutionary 
forces were quick to profit from the rebellion 
he admitted that in our assessment of 1956 in these decades 
the role of counterrevolutionary forces played a leading part in our 
propaganda and we forgot the feeling of the population 
the revolt began oct 23 1956 with demands that soviet troops 
leave hungary about 20000 soviet troops entered budapest to quell 
the uprising on nov 4 and replaced the government 
when he referred to the revolt as a popular uprising on jan 28 
pozsgay said his reassessment was based on the report of a party 
commission investigating four decades of communist rule in hungary 
the report has not been published but grosz said sunday it would 
be he also said pozsgays comments were too hasty 
pozsgays statement touched off unprecedented open debate and 
revealed the party split on the pace and extent of reforms 
the state daily magyar nemzet said saturday two of the new 
groups the new march front and smallholders party already have 
held talks on setting up national organizations before parliament 
legalizes alternative parties

a federal judge threw out a 228 million 
judgment against the long island lighting co on saturday ruling 
that federal racketeering laws do not apply in the fraud case 
brought against the utility 
us district judge jack b weinstein said the case involving 
electricity rates belonged before the state public service 
commission and should not have been brought to the federal court he 
said he became convinced the case did not belong him while presiding 
over the jury trial in december 
what the trial proved was that the federal racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act cannot and should not be 
applied in a case such as this to permit a federal jury in a civil 
case to second guess the ratemaking authority of the state 
weinstein said 
weinstein has been pushing for a settlement of the civil 
racketeering suit brought against lilco by suffolk county on long 
island kenneth r feinberg a courtappointed mediator said the 
ruling puts pressure on both sides to reach a settlement 
negotiators are scheduled to meet monday 
in light of the judges ruling it would be folly not to settle 
this case he said 
suffolk county said it would appeal weinsteins ruling lilco 
officials said they were pleased 
last december a jury found that the financially troubled utility 
had lied to state officials about the progress of the controversial 
shoreham nuclear power plant to obtain rate increases in 1978 and 
1984 the jury awarded 228 million in damages to suffolk county 
that verdict opened lilco to the risk of a classaction suit by 
lilco ratepayers with damages against the utility potentially 
reaching billions of dollars far beyond the net worth of the 
utility 
lilco had filed a motion before the start of the jury trial 
asking weinstein to decide that the matter was not an issue for the 
federal court under the rico statute weinstein reserved judgment on 
the request 
construction on the shoreham plant 60 miles east of manhattan 
began in 1973 and was largely finished a decade later but has never 
been opened 
legal objections to the plant by both state and local governments 
and many long island residents have pushed the cost of shoreham to 
54 billion more than 70 times the original estimate 
the controversy has taken lilco to the brink of bankruptcy 
several times

the pilot of an f5e jet fighter from taiwan that 
crashed in china has asked authorities to help him find his uncle 
an official report said sunday 
the china news service said lt col lin xianshun 35 who 
parachuted to safety saturday was looking for his uncle lin yuyi 
but authorities have yet to find the uncle said an official 
at the staterun news agency 
the official who would only identify himself as zhang said it 
was not clear whether the pilot wished to defect to china 
he has only raised this one request to see his uncle he 
said we are trying to interview him but he is still in the 
hospital 
air force officials in taiwan said the fighter which was on a 
training flight lost contact with a radio tower at chihhang air 
base 180 miles southeast of taipei on saturday morning 
the plane went down in a rice paddy in fengshun county later that 
morning about 180 miles north of canton the provincial capital of 
guangdong province chinese reports said 
chinese reports said the plane crashed because it ran out of oil 
canton television reported lin was taken by helicopter to the 
china air force hospital in canton a chinese reporter saturday 
night said lin was injured slightly on his backside and arm 
in taiwan a relative of the pilot said he believed the officer 
defected to china to see his grandmother but the pilots wife lin 
xuezhen said she believed her husband had lost his way in bad 
weather 
the relative who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity 
from miaoli 30 miles south of taipei said lin had complained that 
military officers were banned from visiting china 
in 1987 the nationalist government in taiwan eased a ban to 
allow all taiwanese except military personnel and government 
employees to visit china 
more than a dozen nationalist air force officers have sought 
asylum in china since 1949 when the nationalists fled to taiwan 
after losing a civil war to the communist forces on the mainland 
the latest was li dawei who defected in 1983 in a trainer plane 
li received 40000 plus use of a chauffeured limousine china late 
last year abolished the system of rewards for taiwanese military 
personnel defecting to the mainland 
the taiwan still offers rewards for chinese military defectors 
but they reduced them in september when china stopped its rewards 
china regards taiwan as a renegade province and the two are 
technically at war

political leaders hailed as a 
milestone on friday president bushs statement that puerto ricans 
should vote on whether they want the caribbean island to remain a 
us commonwealth become the 51st state or be independent 
we are living a historic moment in puerto rico said gov 
rafael hernandez colon i give the words of president bush my 
warmest welcome 
hernandez colon who leads the popular democratic party and 
other island politicians have been lobbying in washington in support 
for a plebiscite so puerto ricos 33 million people can vote on 
their political future 
bush said in an address to congress thursday night i have long 
believed that the people of puerto rico should have the right to 
determine their own political future personally i favor statehood 
but i ask the congress to take the necessary steps to let the people 
decide in a referendum 
his statement followed a joint call on jan 17 by puerto ricos 
three main political parties divided over the status issue for 
congressional support for a plebiscite they asked congress to pass 
legislation guaranteeing the united states would honor the election 
results whatever the outcome 
the people of puerto rico have not been formally consulted by 
the united states as to their choice of their ultimate political 
status they said in a statement 
pedro rosello vice president of the new progressive party which 
advocates statehood said the statement is the type of message we 
were expecting from president bush when the president says he is in 
favor of the process and asks for congressional cooperation it 
gives a seriousness to the issue which never before existed 
ruben berrios who as leader of the independence party favors 
breaking ties binding puerto rico to the united states also 
welcomed bushs statement 
the actual status is unjustifiable because the united states 
cant continue supporting colonialism in puerto rico he said 
hernandez colons popular democratic party supports the 
commonwealth arrangement but wants washington to relinquish control 
over immigration and foreign trade matters 
the emotional status issue has dominated the governors agenda 
the three party leaders are to meet in washington soon with key 
house and senate committee leaders 
in a 1967 referendum 60 percent of puerto ricans favored the 
commonwealth status 39 wanted statehood and 1 percent voted for 
independence however the referendum was not recognized by the us 
congress and congress was not bound to take action no matter what 
the outcome 
hernandez colon wants to make sure that in any future referendum 
congress will guarantee to abide by the results without that he 
has said it would be an exercise in futility 
under commonwealth status puerto ricans are us citizens but 
cannot vote for president they have a representative to congress 
who cannot vote they are eligible for us military service and 
receive billions of federal benefits annually but they dont pay 
us taxes 
puerto rico has been a us commonwealth since 1952 spain ceded 
the island to the united states after the spanishamerican war in 
1898

a foodpoisoning scare prompted a government 
warning friday to pregnant women against eating soft cheeses and 
farmers were ordered to slaughter salmonellainfected chicken flocks 
britain faced foodpoisoning scares on three fronts as police 
were called in to investigate the mercury contamination of butter 
from the countrys largest producer 
sir donald acheson the governments chief medical officer 
warned pregnant women not to eat soft cheeses such as camembert and 
brie after these were linked to several listeria infections in 
britain and abroad 
the bacteria could cause miscarriages and stillbirths he said 
the lancet a british medical journal reported last week that 
two women infected with listeria suffered spontaneous abortions at a 
british hospital while two other listeriainfected women had to 
have caesarian operations to save their babies 
acheson said camembert was safe to eat for everyone except 
pregnant women as far as listeria is concerned the risk is so 
small that it is quite appropriate for the rest of the public to 
carry on as before 
press association the domestic news agency said the government 
planned to set up a committee to examine all aspects of food 
poisoning 
acheson listed several other measures the public should take to 
avoid food poisoning his remarks at a news conference reflected 
heightened public alarm over food poisoning which began in december 
with a salmonellaineggs scare 
egg sales fell 60 percent after a junior health minister edwina 
currie said most british egg production was infected with 
salmonella 
confronted by lawsuits from angry farmers mrs currie resigned 
but the affair has prompted a major debate 
also on friday the agriculture department announced that chicken 
flocks contaminated by salmonella would be slaughtered and their 
owners compensated 
it said new compulsory monitoring of britains 45000 flocks had 
been introduced compensation will be paid according to the birds 
value immediately before slaughter said a spokesman who requested 
anonymity 
it said the volume of compensation and the number of birds 
likely to be slaughtered were not yet known 
egg producers and the national farmers union welcomed the 
announcement and the opposition labor party said it showed that 
the government was at last waking up to the problem 
detectives were called to a creamery belonging to dairy crest 
britains biggest dairy chain in camborne in southwest england 
after mercury was found in a tub of butter at a central england 
supermarket 
peter reay the detective leading the inquiry said at this 
stage there is no evidence to suggest that contamination of the 
product is widespread 
the plant where the contaminated butter was made is to close with 
the loss of 118 jobs but company spokesman john friend said he 
doubted the mercury was planted by a disgruntled worker

if sherv frazier had done something like fudge numbers that 
killed people we wouldnt be having this conversation said dr

plans to restore fraziers professorship

communist hungary is likely to accede to 
the 1951 un convention on the status of refugees a united nations 
official said friday it is believed it would be the first soviet 
bloc country to join the accord 
ghassan arnaout from the genevabased un high commissioner for 
refugees spoke at a news conference after a fiveday tour of 
hungary and its camps for refugees from romania 
he said his group asked hungary to become a party to the 1951 
accord and i think there is a definite good genuine will of 
hungary to accede to the convention asked when he said only 
soon in the coming months 
an estimated 30000 romanian citizens most of them ethnic 
hungarians fled illegally across the border or declined to return 
home from tourist trips since hungary took the unprecedented step 
last year of refusing to force such people back to romania 
hungary says romania is mistreating its 17 million ethnic 
hungarians preventing them from studying their language and 
customs warsaw pact ally romania rejects the charges accusing 
budapest of meddling in its affairs 
economically strapped hungary would welcome international aid in 
looking after the people fleeing from romania and in resettling them 
here or elsewhere arnaout quoted western diplomats as saying 
hungary might be reluctant to accede to the convention if it ran the 
risk of becoming a haven for refugees from other communist nations 
such as czechoslovakia and east germanuy 
he said this matter was not raised during his groups discussions 
with officials

the stock markets early1989 rally has hit its 
first snag but the optimists of wall street profess not to be 
concerned 
in the face of negative news on inflation and a renewed rise in 
interest rates a stretch of five consecutive weekly gains that 
coincided with the start of the new year came to an end this past 
week 
many analysts say they wouldnt be surprised if the 
correction or period of retrenchment lasted a while longer 
but the bulls argue that such a sequence would actually represent 
a happy development for investors who didnt get a chance to join in 
the party earlier 
signs that the current rally is maturing continue to pile up 
said joseph feshbach technical analyst at prudentialbache 
securities in his latest market appraisal 
over the next few weeks feshbach says the market may well 
undergo a consolidation in which the major averages fall 
somewhere on the order of 4 percent to 7 percent 
but he contends the bull market is just beginning for 
industrial stocks in particular since we remain very bullish long 
term we suggest using the coming consolidation as a buying 
opportunity 
similarly the merrill lynch market letter says a fairly 
shallow pullback is in prospect over the near term 
we think a renewed advance in the spring could carry the dow 
industrials to the 2500 area before a more significant correction 
might occur 
a change in investor psychology appears to be contributing more 
to the bullish atmosphere than any changes in the outlooks for the 
economy or corporate profits investors appear more willing to 
accent the positive than the negative 
this new upbeat spirit got a stern test in recent days when the 
labor department reported a much largerthanexpected rise of 1 
percent in the producer price index for january and banks across 
the country raised their prime lending rates from 105 percent to 11 
percent 
the producer price increase the biggest in more than three 
years intensified expectations that the federal reserve would soon 
tighten credit further 
at the close on friday the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
stood at 228607 down 4518 from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 249 to 16401 
on the week the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter 
market dropped 398 to 40237 and the american stock exchange 
market value index was down 211 at 32277 
volume on the big board averaged 19109 million shares a day 
against 18679 million the week before 
while brokers naturally like the revived enthusiasm for stocks 
they are wary of seeing too much of a good thing if everyone 
becomes a believer in the market they reason the rally that 
results could be explosive but short 
memories remain fresh of what followed the high spirits and 
complacency that prevailed for much of 1987 
at the moment however most observers say a healthy amount of 
skepticism persists 
a good sign options traders are still pessimistic asserts 
the merrill lynch letter trading in puts options to sell stock 
remains fairly high in relation to trading in calls options to buy 
stocks 
we interpret this indicator on a contrary basis so recent 
readings appear to be a favorable sign for stocks 
while optimism has been increasing steadily among investment 
advisers reports investors intelligence of new rochelle ny 
measures of sentiment are still bullish and lots of cash is still 
on the sidelines

dont look for a sexy swimsuit issue from the 
latest offspring of sport illustrated 
sports illustrated for kids is aimed at the 8to13yearold 
crowd and publisher ann s moore promises the only people the 
magazine will show in bathing suits will be competing in sports like 
swimming water skiing or surfing or else will likely have an 
olympic gold medal around their neck 
the magazine was launched in january after mrs moore secured 
quartermillion dollar commitments from 30 advertisers half the 
500000 circulation is sold by subscription or starting with the 
march issue at newstands 
the other 250000 copies are given free to third through 
sixthgraders in 1000 of the poorest schools in the nation 
they include places like carter elementary school on chicagos 
south side where the head of the reading resources program jessie 
hamlet says few students could afford a magazine subscription 
my teachers have been so grateful to have them she said 
the kids love it they say things like you mean its ours to 
keep 
she hopes the magazine will encourage students to read 
its something current and the look of it is so nice that it 
makes them want to pick it up and read it thats half the battle 
there she said 
those are reassuring words to moore who says she worked more 
than 18 months on developing and launching the magazine 
improving literacy was one of the pitches she used in persuading 
companies such as ibm and atampt as well as sneaker and snack makers 
to pay 250000 each for a years worth of advertising space 
but the motivation isnt entirely altruistic the magazine is 
expected to make a profit eventually mrs moore said she said it 
also should produce some readers for big si as she calls the 
magazine that spawned it 
a years subscription costs 1595 and single copies will sell 
for 175 the free copies come with tips for teachers on how to use 
the issue in class 
jeanne mannings a health and physical education teacher at 
adamsville elementary school in atlanta said i set aside one day 
a month to go through each article with them to practice their 
reading skills 
for advertisers the magazine is supposed to offer an appealing 
new avenue to youngsters who are often hard to reach with print ads 
mrs moore estimates there are 16 million youngsters in the 
magazines target audience and said they spend 5 billion a year of 
their own money and influence another 40 billion spent by their 
parents 
but at 25000 a page and a guaranteed circulation of 500000 
the advertisers are paying a premium over other magazines aimed at 
children 
boys life magazine for instance charges 17650 for a page and 
has a monthly circulation of 13 million scholastic inc charges 
10000 for a page in junior scholastic magazine with a bimonthly 
circulation of 700000 
mrs moore said she tried to avoid making her magazine something 
that youngsters perceive to be good for them 
the january issue profiled basketballs michael jordan 
footballs doug williams sled racer susan butcher and described the 
ride two 10yearolds took in a blimp each issue has regular 
sections explaining rules of the game advice from the pros a 
celebritys description of his or her worst day a poster of an 
athlete training tips sports quizzes and trading cards 
some advertisers developed unique approaches 
foot lockers ads ask who was first to achieve athletic feats 
such as who first shattered a basketball backboard converse shoe 
ads address questions children have directed to athletes such as 
footballs bernie kosar 
american airlines ads trace the history of flying machines 
mary oneill an american spokeswoman said the carrier wants to 
impress on children that american is a quality company when they 
start thinking about careers we hope they think american airlines 
might be a real good place for them to work she said 
publisher moore makes no apologies for sending a magazine with 
paid ads into the school rooms we have researched this with 
teachers and parents and they welcomed the idea of having a real 
magazine with ads she said 
some types of ads such as cigarettes or liquor are prohibited and 
she hopes to keep the proportion of ads to editorial copy low 
teachers said advertising is a small price to pay for the 
benefits of getting a quality magazine free 
a school official in oakland calif who asked not to be 
identified by name said her teachers have used the magazine to 
teach students how advertising works 
in chicago ms hamlet said she has heard no complaints about the 
ads 
wouldnt that be nice if the magazine carried no ads but the 
real world isnt like that she said

labor relations are poisonous and cheap fares may be secondary to 
new planes and swank service 
all those elements melded together in the jungle of airline 
competition this past week and seemed to underscore the idea that 
darwins survival of the fittest theory is profoundly reshaping the 
landscape of us carriers 10 years after congress unleashed them 
to set fares and routes on their own 
american said it was acquiring new mcdonnell douglas corp jets 
in a deal that analysts said could be worth as much as 7 billion 
potentially one of the biggest fleet modernizations ever the md11 
jumbos and smaller md80 twinjets would replace americans aging 
dc10s and boeing 727s 
americans announcement came against a background of rising 
concern about the safety of older planes no matter how well theyre 
maintained 
the enormous metal stress caused by repeated landings and 
takeoffs has been increasingly mentioned as a possible source of 
trouble and some analysts say it has influenced the publics 
perception about which airline to fly if thats true the carriers 
with the newest planes stand to sell more seats 
american wasnt the only airline to buy planes this past week 
northwest airlines said it ordered 10 airbus a330 jetliners worth 
860 million the hightech planes are built by the european rival 
to boeing and mcdonnell douglas 
both airlines are among the biggest and most profitable in the 
country partly because they have relied on a strategy of improving 
service instead of simply slashing fares industry analysts have 
said 
while american and northwest were shopping eastern airlines was 
scrambling to plan for what could be a devastating walkout in march 
a key month for the moneylosing airline because it is the height of 
the florida vacation season 
easterns militant machinists vowed to strike because of an 
impasse over labor concessions demanded by management an issue that 
has inflamed passions at the airline for years and played a role in 
easterns steadily eroding base of customers 
in a prelude of what may come the airline suspended 100 
wildcatters and easterns pilots hinted they may honor any picket 
lines 
the fighting coincided with an announcement by easterns parent 
texas air corp that it lost 2244 million in the last three months 
of 1988 and 7186 million for the year the worst in aviation 
history the previous record was held by pan am corp which lost 
485 million in 1982 
pan am meanwhile dropped hints of its own problems the 
airlines chairman extexas air aide thomas plaskett told an 
industry seminar that pan am must expand operations to survive one 
way to do this he said is through an acquisition of pan am by 
another airline 
in other business and economic developments this past week 
disappointment with president bushs budget strategy a sharp 
jump in wholesale prices and other concerns about rising inflation 
spooked wall street and sent the dow jones industrials reeling for a 
weekly loss of 4518 points

loan industry that includes a 50 billion bond sale to fund 
bailouts higher deposit insurance rates and seizure of sick thrifts

some economists expect the nations biggest banks 
to raise their prime interest rates at least once more before 
spring even though the banks have just nudged the key rate up half 
a percentage point 
major banks on friday raised their prime rates to 11 percent from 
105 percent to keep pace with rising rates on financial markets 
it was the first increase of 1989 for the prime rate which is a 
benchmark for setting interest on a variety of consumer and 
corporate loans such as adjustablerate mortgages 
fridays increase put the prime rate at its highest level since 
it reached 1075 percent in late 1984 the last increase from 10 
percent to 105 percent occurred nov 28 
chicagobased continental bank and republic national bank of new 
york were the first to increase the prime and soon were followed by 
citibank the nations largest bank and other money center banks 
the increase had been widely expected by economists 
it was inevitable said lawrence chimerine chairman of wefa 
group an economic forecasting service in bala cynwyd pa short 
term interest rates have been trending upward 
the prime reflects a banks costs of borrowing money including 
interest it pays on customer accounts shortterm certificates of 
deposit and bonds and as such mirrors rather than forecasts rate 
trends 
market rates have been rising due partly to the federal reserves 
tightening of credit in an attempt to fight inflation 
records released friday indicated the federal open market 
committee the central banks policymaking body decided in 
december to boost interest rates to help hold down inflation 
shortterm rates in the credit markets have risen more rapidly 
than longterm rates in recent weeks in an unusual situation 
earlier this week rates on shortterm treasury securities briefly 
were higher than those for longterm bonds indicating investors 
believed the fed was tightening credit and that inflation would 
decline in the long term 
a government report friday on inflation worsened the outlook for 
interest rates and was really the last straw for the banks said 
david wyss chief financial economist for data resources inc in 
lexington mass 
the labor department said its producer price index surged at an 
annual rate of 127 percent in january 
rates rose in the credit markets after the labor department 
report as traders were convinced the jump in wholesale prices would 
force the fed to push interest rates even higher 
the treasurys 30year issue was off nearly 565 per each 1000 
in face value in late trading that boosted the yield on the bond 
which itself is considered a barometer of rate speculation to 904 
percent from 889 percent late thursday 
the fed could directly drive rates upward by raising its own 
discount rate the interest it charges on loans to commercial banks 
however chimerine said the fed governors likely would take a 
more indirect route by putting further upward pressure on the 
socalled federal funds rate the interest banks charge one another 
for overnight loans 
chimerine and wyss anticipated there would be at least one more 
jump in the prime rate before spring especially if the government 
issued more reports indicating a surging economy and soaring 
inflation 
wyss predicted interest rates would peak before april or may 
because the economy is likely to show some signs of slowing down 
one reason for a slowdown would be higher interest rates he said

worries about rising inflation and interest rates 
sparked the biggest stock selloff of the year depressed bond prices 
and boosted the dollars value in foreign exchange 
the dow jones industrial average tumbled 3697 points to 228607 
on friday the biggest drop in that key market indicator since nov 
16 
an accompanying decline in the bond market was more modest but it 
extended the losses bonds suffered in a thursday selloff which was 
the sharpest in three months for the credit markets 
meanwhile the dollar rallied on the prospect that the federal 
reserve might tighten its monetary policy pushing interest rates 
even higher in an effort to choke off inflation 
separately the nations biggest banks boosted their prime 
lending rates by a half percentage point to 11 percent the highest 
level since late 1984 and a reflection of recent rises in other 
rates 
roiling the financial markets was the labor departments report 
friday morning that wholesale prices jumped 1 percent in january 
the increase was about twice as large as expected 
bond prices tumbled and interest rates surged higher within 
moments of the report 
in the first couple of minutes there was absolute shock 
said elliott platt fixedincome research director for the 
investment firm donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities the market 
went down hard 
prices of the treasurys 30year bond considered a sensitive 
gauge of interest rate speculation fell 10 for every 1000 in 
face value during a burst of trading after the report prices edged 
back up later in the day in more subdued activity 
by late trading prices of the benchmark 30year bond were down 
about 5 for every 1000 in face value and the yield jumped to 903 
percent from 889 percent late thursday 
that loss came on top of thursdays setback that saw the price of 
30year bonds sink 1625 for every 1000 in face value 
on wall street the dow jones industrial average lost 18 points 
after the first 30 minutes of trading recoverted somewhat at midday 
but deteriorated in the afternoon to finish with a 3697point loss 
for the day 
but the inflation report supported the dollar which benefits 
from speculation that the fed will tighten credit and boost interest 
rates which make the dollar more attractive to foreign investors 
by the end of trading in new york the dollar traded at 18695 
west german marks up from 18475 late thursday and at 12868 
japanese yen up from 12793 late thursday 
president bushs budget message to congress on thursday also was 
cited for the sour performance in the stock and bond markets as 
traders faulted him for failing to propose more aggressive steps to 
trim the federal deficit 
the markets looked at it as a warmedover version of former 
president reagans budget any changes were modest and around the 
edges said gary schlossberg senior financial economist for wells 
fargo bank in san francisco 
fridays increase put the prime rate at its highest level since 
it reached 1075 percent in late 1984 the last increase from 10 
percent to 105 percent occurred nov 28 
some analysts said they expect further increases for the prime 
which is a benchmark for setting interest on a variety of consumer 
and corporate loans such as adjustablerate mortgages

drexel burnham lambert incs top bond trader 
michael r milken has moved to block the firms record criminal 
fraud settlement on grounds it illegally denies him his job and 
multimilliondollar pay 
attorneys for milken on friday asked us district judge kimba 
wood to reject drexels 650 million settlement with the government 
on the grounds it violates his constitutional rights 
if successful the motion could force prosecutors and defense 
attorneys back into negotiations or possibly court after a 
twoyear investigation and settlement that allowed drexel to avoid a 
potentially lengthy and embarrassing trial 
the prosecutor here is acting like a sheriff in the wild west 
solely on his own initiative and in his wholly unfettered 
discretion said the motion filed with wood 
milken is one of the biggest targets of a federal crackdown on 
securitieslaw abuse and is expected to be indicted soon on fraud 
and racketeering charges stemming from his powerful position at 
drexel one of the nations largest investment firms the pressure 
on him has intensified since drexel agreed to cooperate with 
prosecutors as part of its pleabargain settlement 
details of the agreement made public two weeks ago also require 
drexel to withhold at least half of the money due to milkens 
brother senior drexel aide lowell j milken for 1988 and to 
suspend him if indicted 
the prosecutor seeksto achieve indirectly what he could not 
achieve directly to punish the milkens through the imposition of 
multimilliondollar fines and the deprivation of their livelihoods 
without indictment hearing and trials the 28page motion by 
defense attorneys said 
this action both denies them due process of law and constitutes 
an unconstitutional taking of property it added 
assistant us attorney bruce baird declined to comment on the 
motion saying the government would respond in court papers 
milken who heads drexels beverly hills califbased highyield 
junk bond department has been credited with pioneering the 175 
billion market for these debt securities used to finance takeovers 
and the growth of small companies 
the motion said his 1988 pay would greatly exceed 100 
million almost entirely through a yearly bonus tied to his 
performance 
neither milken has been charged with any criminal activity and 
both have denied wrongdoing 
this is the government using drexel to take money that michael 
and lowell milken have already earned without bringing a charge 
against either of them said michael armstrong an attorney for 
lowell milken 
the motion said the agreement violates their rights because it 
precedes hearings on whether the milkens committed any crime 
whether their property can be legally seized or whether there is any 
lawful basis for suspending them 
in settling criminal charges with the government drexel agreed 
to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay 300 million in fines 
and civil penalties another 350 million would be placed in an 
account to settle potential civil claims 
the agreement reached dec 21 after two years of investigation 
of the nations fifthlargest securities firm included allegations 
of crooked deals with nowimprisoned speculator ivan boesky and the 
defunct securities firm princetonnewport partners 
the pact remains subject to approval by the securities and 
exchange commission and the court negotiations with the sec 
reportedly have stalled because of an sec demand that drexel move 
its junk bond division to new york 
once approved by the sec the agreement is to be sent to judge 
wood for final approval 
in a separate letter to the judge armstrong said the plea 
agreement was improperly filed with the court and should not have 
been disclosed publicly until drexel formally enters a guilty plea 
details of the agreement were revealed after us attorney 
rudolph giuliani requested that the specific counts be unsealed 
giuliani who left office the week after the charges were made 
public made prosecuting wall street crimes a priority of his 
fiveyear tenure 
drexel is one of the most profitable investment concerns in the 
country with 10000 employees worldwide

attorneys for ivan boesky the onetime stock 
speculator who now works on a prison cleanup crew are waiting for 
indictments in a related wall street scandal before requesting his 
early release sources said 
the lawyers reportedly are waiting to see whether disgraced 
highyield bond financier michael milken of drexel burnham lambert 
inc is indicted in a case based on information supplied by boesky 
before moving to have boeskys threeyear term shortened 
the attorneys believe an indictment of milken would be further 
evidence of the value of boeskys information in weeding out wall 
street corruption according to sources close to the case who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
on friday boesky attorney robert mccaw said boesky has not 
applied for parole from the minimum security prison camp in lompoc 
calif and has no current plans to do so 
boesky becomes eligible for parole on march 21 he began serving 
his sentence at the 44000acre former military barracks about 150 
miles north of los angeles last march 23 
he will seek a parole hearing at the point where his advisers 
think it is most likely he would get some kind of favorable 
consideration mccaw said there has been no parole hearing date 
scheduled there is nothing imminent 
mccaw said there was no chance boesky would be released by 
march on parole and relatively little chance he would be freed 
on a judges order 
parole hearings at the 689inmate prison known as club fed 
because of recreation facilities including a tennis court and boccie 
ball court are held every other month and boesky is not on the 
march docket lompoc unit manager jim finley said 
under federal prison sentencing guidelines boeskys earliest 
possible nonparole release date based on good behavior is april 4 
1990 
boesky once wall streets bestknown speculator in the stocks of 
potential takeover targets is now working on a prison cleanup crew 
mccaw said 
he is likely to be released early only if manhattan federal judge 
morris e lasker who sentenced boesky rewards his cooperation in 
helping nail other wall street felons 
last april boeskys lawyers asked lasker to reduce his sentence 
on grounds that information boesky gave the government unearthed 
other fraud cases including the mammoth investigation of drexel 
that resulted in a record 650 million pleabargain settlement in 
december 
the attorneys asked lasker to wait until this past october to 
hear their motion but have delayed even longer 
sources close to the case said boeskys lawyers are waiting to 
see whether milken is indicted on fraud charges before pressing for 
boeskys release 
milken is expected to be charged as a result of drexels plea 
deal in which the securities firm agreed to pay 650 million in 
fines and restitution and plead guilty to six felony counts 
boesky could be expected to ask lasker for a hearing on early 
release fairly quickly after milken is indicted one source 
said adding that a pending final agreement on terms of the drexel 
settlement also could help boeskys case 
in the atmosphere of trying to show that his postsentence and 
present cooperation has shown real tangible fruits its better that 
its settled said the source 
assistant us attorney bruce baird said there has been no change 
in the status of boeskys case he declined to comment on whether 
the government would oppose any early release request 
boesky 52 stunned the financial world in november 1986 when he 
paid the securities and exchange commission 100 million to settle 
charges he illegally used nonpublic insider information to profit in 
securities deals he was banished from the securities business for 
life 
he then cooperated in a massive federal probe that has resulted 
in criminal or civil charges in nearly two dozen cases in the united 
states and britain in return boesky was allowed to plead guilty to 
a single count of conspiracy to lie to the sec

everyone talks about inflation the steam boiler 
operators of the american economy do something about it 
the boiler operators are the littleknown federal reserve 
functionaries who add steam to the economy or take it away by 
manipulating the reserves of the banking system 
the importance of their manipulations became obvious friday when 
the labor department reported wholesale inflation in january 
skyrocketed to an annual rate of 127 percent 
it was apparent too when major banks raised their prime rate to 
11 percent the highest level since 1984 
the combination of high rates and high inflation leaves the 
federal reserve in a delicate position 
should it push rates even higher and risk triggering a recession 
or should it leave rates where they are and risk allowing 
inflation to rage out of control 
the policy decisions are made in secret by the federal open 
market committee a group of 12 fed governors and regional fed bank 
presidents 
the people who carry out those decisions the steam boiler 
operators sit on the eighth floor of an imposing italian 
renaissancestyle building near wall street the home of the new 
york federal reserve bank 
joan e lovett runs the 20person open market trading desk she 
reports to peter d sternlight who in turn answers to the federal 
open market committee 
unlike ordinary bond traders fed traders usually enter the 
market just once a day and they dont care about profits their 
only job is to keep excess banking reserves at the level specified 
by the open market committee 
the bedrock assumption is that banks will lend up to the limit 
permitted by their level of reserves if banks get more reserves 
they will increase their lending if they lose reserves they will 
have to cut back lending 
if the fed wants to stoke the furnace of the economy it buys 
treasury bills in the open market the cash it spends for the 
treasury bills ends up as extra reserves on the books of commercial 
banks the banks increase lending and the economy expands 
conversely selling treasury bills drains reserves from the 
banking system and banks have to cut back on lending 
the fed traders monitor the federal funds rate which is how much 
banks charge each other for the overnight loans they need to meet 
their reserve requirements 
the fed can make direct loans to the banks at what it calls the 
discount rate but borrowing at the discount window is a 
privilege not a right and banks use it sparingly 
if the fed funds rate gets too high the open market desk injects 
reserves into the system by buying treasury bills if the rate drops 
they sell bills 
the fed also trades in other government securities but less 
frequently no small player it typically does transactions of 2 
billion or 3 billion at once 
for shortterm finetuning the fed can inject reserves 
temporarily through repurchase agreements known as repos 
customers sell treasury bills to the fed with the agreement to 
repurchase them soon usually the next day 
to drain reserves temporarily the fed does matched salepurchase 
agreements or matched sales the fed sells securities to 
customers and agrees to buy them back a few days later 
not every fed move is fraught with significance for instance 
the fed drains reserves every month to compensate for deposits of 
government checks 
in the face of turmoil in the markets and uncertainty about the 
economys direction the goal of the feds steam boiler operators is 
simply stability 
achieving this in the face of very large flows of funds in and 
out of the economy which are not under our control thats the skill 
of the open market desk said peter bakstansky a new york fed 
spokesman
