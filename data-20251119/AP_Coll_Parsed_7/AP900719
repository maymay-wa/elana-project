rebels on thursday launched what 
appeared to be a major offensive about three miles from the center 
of the capital witnesses said 
travelers from the loganville section of monrovia reported large 
numbers of government casualties lying around the railway terminal 
one witness reported a truck loaded with government wounded rushing 
toward the citys only working hospital 
the fighting was near the bong iron ore mines railway and the 
terminal itself witnesses said the railroad station three miles 
from downtown monrovia was the closest the rebels have yet come to 
the city center after a 10day lull in the 7monthold civil war 
in washington meanwhile the foreign minister of liberia and 
other prominent liberians appealed thursday to the united states 
for a temporary us peacekeeping force to help prevent further 
bloodshed 
foreign minister j rudolph johnson washington ambassador 
eugenia wordsworthstevenson and eight other liberians wrote 
president bush that they expect the resignation and departure 
from liberia of president samuel doe and the establishment of 
an interim government 
the letter proposed a limited us force be provided on the 
invitation of that interim government to play an initial 
peacekeeping role in the vicinity of monrovia 
the appeal did not explain how the resignation and departure of 
doe would be carried out 
earlier thursday rebels ambushed government troops trying to 
take a key intersection on the road to the countrys international 
airport forcing them to retreat military sources said 
sixty government troops were sent to recapture red light 
junction six miles from downtown the military sources said 
forces of the rebel national patriotic front of liberia ambushed 
the troops killing three 
the junction is on the main road to the international airport at 
robertsfield held by the rebels for several weeks journalists who 
tried to visit the area were turned back by government troops one 
mile from the fighting 
the rebels have brought heavy artillery to the north of 
monrovia liberian security sources said armored cars and 
artillery have been seen moving south from kakata toward monrovia 
in the past two days the sources said 
rebel control of parts of lofa county north of monrovia has 
led government troops to turn back refugees fleeing the capital 
witnesses said 
in the capital food shortages and the fear of a rebel attack 
increased up to 1300 lebanese living in liberia primarily small 
businessmen and their families have registered with the lebanese 
embassy to leave aboard a ship en route from tunisia 
we dont feel any direct threat but theres a great deal of 
looting taking place not only businesses but houses as well 
lebanese ambassador michel bitard said 
the ship has been chartered by the arab league 
in neighboring sierra leone a rebel leader thomas woewiyu 
said late thursday that no progress was made in talks between 
intermediaries of the two sides he said the rebels would not 
compromise on their demand that doe resign before a formal 
ceasefire can be reached 
the rebels led by former doe aide charles taylor advanced to 
the fringes of monrovia before their advance was halted taylor 
accuses does government of corruption inefficiency and human 
rights abuses 
doe has agreed not to seek reelection but has so far refused to 
leave the country he has a force of 500 israelitrained troops 
defending his heavily fortified residence in monrovia 
random killings have been reported on both sides as the 
insurgency has degenerated into tribal warfare most rebels come 
from the gio and mano tribes while government supporters are 
mostly krahns and mandingos doe is a krahn 
hundreds of people are streaming out of the city in the 
direction of sierra leone taylors forces have opened the highway 
from the surrounded capital to the sierra leone border to allow 
refugees to flee military sources reported 
most of monrovia has been without power for two weeks and water 
supplies have been cut residents have been forced to collect rain 
water and forage for food as supplies dwindle and soldiers loot 
what is left 
doe took power in a violent 1980 coup that ousted the 
incumbents descendants of american immigrants who historically 
monopolized power and discriminated against indigenous liberians 
liberia was founded in the 19th century by freed slaves from the 
united states

the earthquake that struck the main 
philippines island of luzon caught president corazon aquinos 
government illprepared for disaster and dramatized her 
administrations organizational shortcomings 
three days after the quake which measured 77 on the richter 
scale the government has no comprehensive picture of the extent of 
damage and casualties 
relief operations appear centered in areas such as baguio where 
media focused its attention 
the immediate task is the rescue and feeding of survivors 
said the newspaper malaya three days after the earthquake the 
abject failure of the government on this score is appalling 
even in baguio a lack of coordination among government agencies 
was clear 
the office of civil defense counted 82 people dead in baguio 
110 miles to the north chief of staff gen renato de villa said 91 
were killed and the red cross estimated 118 dead 
poor communications forced local officials to use private radio 
and television stations to alert manila of the devastation and 
appeal for help 
today rep simeon garcia told radio station dzmm that about 100 
motorists stranded by the quake were at his home in nueva ecija 
province waiting for help promised by the army days ago but as yet 
unreceived 
clearly if we hope to reduce the number of deaths and the 
extent of the damage wrought by natural calamities we as a nation 
must give priority to disaster monitoring prediction and 
preparedness the philippine daily inquirer said today 
problems of communication and coordination emerged within 
moments of the mondays quake when mrs aquino dispatched 
officials to survey the damage in manila and ordered the military 
to ferry stranded commuters 
few military trucks appeared on the streets and tens of 
thousands of commuters wound up walking home 
that typified the governments reaction to the crisis good 
intentions but neither the resources nor the organization to 
implement them 
the temblor struck about a half hour before government offices 
normally close for the day most state employees simply went home 
early fearing another quake 
soon afterward the presidential press office announced that the 
government was studying the extent of damage 
it was only after commercial radio stations broadcast damage 
reports from their provincial affiliates that the government began 
to respond 
first reports focused on cabanatuan city 60 miles north of 
manila where a sixstory school collapsed trapping hundreds of 
students and teachers 
on tuesday mrs aquino flew to the city for her first view of 
the relief operations reporters who traveled with her said she was 
angry over what she saw 
whos in charge aides quoted her as asking local officials 
the rescue operation is so slow why 
only after returning from cabanatuan did she declare a state 
of calamity in affected provinces on wednesday she hurredly 
added la union province to the list after radio and television 
stations broadcast first reports of massive destruction there 
the government maintains a system of regional disaster 
coordinating councils which are supposed to marshal the nations 
resources to cope with calamities 
but the regional committees lack money equipment 
communications and trained rescue personnel cabanatuan mayor 
honorato perez used commercial radio stations to beg manila for 
cranes jackhammers and trained rescuers 
the government sent troops to cabanatuan but they were no 
better trained in rescue operations than the civilian volunteers 
in baguio where the temblor damaged the airport runway and cut 
land routes into the city stocks of emergency supplies and 
equipment were insufficient to mount an effective relief operation 
even if local authorities were better equipped the highly 
centralized government structure tends to inhibit grassroots 
initiatives the simplest request often turns into a bureaucratic 
nightmare 
for example as the philippines appealed to the world for help 
the office of the president produced implementing guidelines 
for receiving foreign donations 
interested overseas donors or their local representatives are 
to submit written offers to the presidential management staff once 
notified of the governments acceptance the donors are to submit a 
bill of lading or airway bill for clearance by the presidential 
management staff which in turn transmits all necessary documents 
to the bureau of customs the bureau of customs initiates the 
processing of import documents and releases the donation to the 
office of the president finally the office of the president turns 
over the donations to the designated recipient agency or 
organization 
such disorderly responses are sadly routine nearly every time 
disaster strikes 
during typhoons comprehensive reports of damage and casualties 
often take days or even weeks to reach manila delaying the 
shipment of food medicine and supplies to the victims 
the lack of coordination seems all the more surprising because 
an average of 20 typhoons strike the philippines annually some 
routinely kill hundreds 
from the moment the quake struck until this very 
moment we have had to play it by ear and improvise said the 
manila times many of the hundreds of people killed in this 
latest disaster could have been spared if only we had all taken to 
heart the deadly serious business of disaster preparedness

an appeals court has thrown out the 
convictions of four people sentenced to life in prison two years 
ago for a 1980 bombing that killed 85 people at bolognas train 
station 
it said after 15 days of deliberation that defendants valerio 
fioravanti his wife francesca mambro massimiliano fachini and 
sergio picciafuoco had not committed the crime 
staterun raitv described wednesdays verdict as a shock 
the aug 2 1980 bombing was one of the worst terrorist actions in 
europe 
the court also reversed the convictions for slander of licio 
gelli former grandmaster of the secret propaganda due p2 
masonic lodge and financier francesco pazienza sentenced to 10 
years in prison in the first trial 
prosecutors described the bologna attack as a neofascist plot 
to undermine italys democracy and the four convicted of planting 
the bomb as rightwing terrorists 
p2 allegedly backed rightwing terrorism as a means of throwing 
the country into confusion to pave the way for an eventual rightist 
dictatorship 
the slander charges were based on a 1981 incident when 
explosives similar to those kind used at bologna were found on a 
train at bolognas station prosecutors claimed gelli and pazienza 
misled investigators by claiming the explosives were linked to 
other people

the remains of former bulgarian leader 
georgi dimitrov revered as national hero during communist rule 
have been removed from a downtown mausoleum and cremated the state 
news agency bta reported 
it said wednesday that the cremation took place in the presence 
of relatives suggesting the procedure took place overnight to 
avoid publicity 
despite longtime official veneration dimitrov has become 
increasingly unpopular particularly in sofia where the 
noncommunist opposition union of democratic forces emerged as 
clear winner in last months multiparty elections 
the mausoleum that had held dimitrovs remains has been guarded 
around the clock by two soldiers in traditional balkanstyle dress 
uniform equipped with bayonettopped rifles 
a leading figure in the international communist movement 
dimitrov was acquitted in a trial in late 1933 in which he was 
charged with complicity in the fire that destroyed the german 
reichstag parliament building 
historians say the arson was a nazi provocation 
in 1946 dimitrov became leader of the bulgarian communist party 
and also headed the government until his death in 1949 
under dimitrov noncommunist opposition parties were either 
disbanded or merged in a communistdominated mass organization

moscows decision to drop its objection to 
nato membership for a reunited germany likely will put eastwest 
arms control negotiations back on track administration officials 
and private arms control experts say 
defense secretary dick cheney told reporters wednesday that 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs concession on german 
participation in the north atlantic treaty organization removed 
the last roadblock to clinching two landmark arms control 
agreements 
cheney referred to 23nation negotiations to sharply reduce the 
number of conventional arms tanks troops and aircraft in 
europe and to ussoviet talks on slashing strategic or 
longrange nuclear missiles by onethird 
the conventional arms negotiations have been bogged down for 
months by several key disputes including nato resistance to a 
soviet demand that the west german government of chancellor helmut 
kohl accept a numerical limit on its armed forces 
kohl had said his country must not be singled out for such 
limits but at his summit with gorbachev on monday kohl agreed 
that a united germany would have no more than 370000 troops in its 
army 45 percent fewer than the present combined strength of the 
east and west germanys armed forces 
in return gorbachev withdrew his objections to permitting a 
united germany in nato whose leaders pledged at a meeting in 
london on july 6 to relax their military readiness and reduce their 
reliance on nuclear arms 
settlement of the german troop strength question is likely to 
give new life to the eastwest conventional arms negotiations under 
way in vienna arms control analysts said wednesday 
it definitely helps said david shorr associate director of 
the british american security information council a research group 
based in washington and london 
shorr said the kohlgorbachev deal made it increasingly likely 
that the vienna negotiators will meet their unofficial deadline of 
completing a treaty in time for a 35nation summit to be held in 
paris on nov 19 to ratify a new political relationship among the 
united states the soviet union canada and all of europe 
some obstacles to a conventional forces agreement are yet to be 
worked out they include 
whether a limit should be placed on individual nations shares 
of the total number of troops allowed in europe 
which kinds of aircraft should be counted in the military 
equipment limits 
under what circumstances a country would be allowed to convert 
military equipment to civilian use 
how often each country would have to permit inspections of 
conventional arms on its soil 
the kohlgorbachev agreement appeared to have little direct 
application to the ussoviet strategic arms reduction talks to 
reduce longrange nuclear missile arsenals although cheney 
mentioned start in saying arms agreements were now more likely 
cheney did not elaborate on this point but analysts said they 
believed resolution of the last remaining major political obstacle 
to german reunification would make it easier for washington and 
moscow to resolve their start disagreements 
the national security bureaucracies in both countries have 
been preoccupied with these questions of german reunification 
said dunbar lockwood who studies start issues for the private arms 
control association now they can start thinking about arms 
control again 
three major issues remain unresolved in the start talks which 
gorbachev and president bush have said they hope to complete by the 
end of this year the stickiest issue is how far the soviets will 
be allowed to go in modernizing their ss18 intercontinental 
ballistic missiles which form the backbone of the soviet nuclear 
arsenal 
the two other unresolved matters are limits on the soviet 
backfire bomber and soviet efforts to restrict us sales of 
strategic nuclear systems to britain

the collapse of prosoviet regimes in eastern 
europe and the impending union of the two germanys gave president 
mikhail s gorbachev little choice but to abandon his opposition to 
the new germanys membership in nato 
i dont think he had any bargaining chips left once east 
germany collapsed said adam ulam a professor at harvard 
university it was obvious that he would have to accept anything 
that was offered 
what west german chancellor helmut kohl offered was 3 billion 
in credits to ease an increasingly desperate soviet debt problem 
plus continued german support for western aid to the soviet union 
gorbachevs aboutface on the issue of german membership in nato 
also came after he won promises that germany would cut its armed 
forces and that the atlantic alliance would adjust its policies to 
the shrinking soviet threat 
we got what we wanted too it was a stepbystep process 
with concessions on both sides a senior soviet diplomat said 
a senior western diplomat who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity said gorbachev got what he needed in london and from 
kohl 
both diplomats were referring to statement issued after a recent 
north atlantic treaty organization meeting in london that the 
western alliance was shifting from a military to a political 
alliance as requested by the kremlin and to an agreement by kohl 
to reduce the german armed forces 
soviet media however still have not reported in detail 
gorbachevs meeting with kohl on monday when the soviet leader 
dropped months of ardent opposition to german membership in nato 
the soviet union lost 20 million people during world war ii and 
memories of the nazi invasion still are bitter 
in his meeting with gorbachev kohl agreed that in the next 
three or four years the united german army will be cut to 370000 
troops the two germanys now have about 600000 men under arms 
480000 of them in the west 
kohl and gorbachev also agreed 
to begin negotiations on the complete withdrawal of soviet 
soldiers from what is now east germany the approximately 380000 
soldiers should be withdrawn in three to four years they said 
that no nato forces will be stationed in what is now east 
germany as long as soviet forces are there german soldiers not 
integrated into the nato command may be stationed there as soon as 
unification is completed 
the rights of the four victorious world war ii powers 
france the united states britain and the soviet union will 
cease immediately upon unification but western forces may remain 
in berlin as long as soviet soldiers stay in any part of the 
country 
poland which had sought guarantees that germany would not seek 
to regain land that once was german but has been polish since the 
war this week said it was satisified with the arrangement 
ulam reached by telephone in cambridge mass said he would 
be surprised if the soviets did not have their forces out of 
germany within a year shortly after the expected unification of 
germany 
most soviet troops in eastern europe are stationed in east 
germany and have been in a precarious position since the communist 
government in poland fell and the hardline east german regime 
collapsed last year 
the soviet union where people can wait a decade or more for 
housing will have a difficult time absorbing the returning 
soldiers and their families 
kohl has agreed to foot part of the bill for keeping soviet 
troops in east germany moscowbased diplomats said but pressure 
is expected to mount to use the money for the civilian economy 
kohl along with president francois mitterrand of france also 
has been pushing for western aid to support gorbachevs reform 
efforts 
president bush has balked at the french and german proposal 
urging the allies to wait until the soviets move more decisively 
from a planned to a market economy 
western diplomats in moscow say bush wants the international 
monetary fund to impose on the soviets the same type of stringent 
economic conditions it would on needy developing nations 
that way it would be an economic condition and not a 
political condition said a western diplomat 
gorbachev might find that formula convenient as well 
he has given in on almost everything said ulam his 
political skills are great but they consist largely of being able 
to swim with the current

the senate ethics committee is calling on the 
full senate to denounce sen dave durenberger who is agreeing to 
pay up to 124000 in restitution for his financial misconduct 
the minnesota republican said he would repay the money as a 
tangible sign of my regret 
the committee unanimously approved a resolution wednesday saying 
that durenberger knowingly and willingly violated senate rules 
through financial dealings that were unequivocally unethical 
leaders of the senate say they hope to put the recommendations 
to a vote by the time congress leaves for its august recess 
senate historians say that denouncing or censuring a colleague 
is the most serious disciplinary action senators can take short of 
expulsion 
the committee said durenberger should reimburse the senate 
29050 plus interest for improper payments on his minneapolis 
condominium and give to charity about 95000 that he collected in 
excess speaking fees that amount would be reduced by whatever 
taxes he has already paid on the income 
durenberger has incurred more than 500000 in legal fees 
the panel referred its findings without making any 
recommendations to senate republicans who could strip durenberger 
of any positions of party responsibility 
the findings also will go to federal agencies including the 
justice department and federal election commission 
of all the thousands of words that have been written or spoken 
during 23 months of investigation news coverage and commentary 
only three are appropriate today i am sorry durenberger said in 
a brief statement after committee leaders announced their 
recommendation 
i accept the committees direction to make restitution as a 
tangible sign of my regret and continuing commitment to the people 
of minnesota he said 
durenbergers popularity has plummeted in minnesota according 
to opinion polls but he has said he will not resign he does not 
face reelection until 1994 
state democratic chairman todd otis called on durenberger to 
resign saying he had brought a black cloud to minnesota 
politics 
the ethics committee found the following violations which it 
said brought the senate into dishonor and disrepute 
a book contract with piranha press that durenberger used to 
collect 100000 in speaking fees over the senates limits on 
honoraria 
real estate transactions involving his minneapolis condominium 
so he could obtain reimbursement from the senate for staying there 
his failure to report the receipt of travel expenses in 
connection with his bookpromotion appearances and trips to the 
boston area where he made speeches to coincide with visits to his 
marriage counselor 
his discussions about the condominium with the trustee of his 
blind trust 
acceptance of free limousine service in violation of senate 
gift limits 
conversion of a 5000 campaign contribution to personal use 
the committees vice chairman sen warren rudman rnh told 
reporters that the panel found a pattern of misconduct in his book 
and condominium deals taken in their totality the committee 
decided unanimously that they merited regretfully this severe 
punishment rudman said 
although the matters were referred to the fec and justice 
department rudman said there was no finding of criminality 
anywhere in the report 
rudman and committee chairman howell heflin dala said they 
intentionally did not recommend any specific action to republican 
senators 
that is not a proper matter for the ethics committee that is 
a republican party matter rudman said they can read they can 
look at the sanction 
the committees report should go to the senate in seven to 10 
days 
the panel still has before it a series of loans that durenberger 
received from a st paul minn bank at favorable terms during the 
1980s but rudman said he did not expect the panel to pursue the 
matter 
the committee has been embroiled in a dispute with the minnesota 
commerce department over records of an investigation of the 
commercial state bank durenberger and bank officials have denied 
he received special treatment

all children with severe measles should take 
vitamin a supplements to sharply reduce the risk of complications 
and death a study published today concludes 
measles kills about 2 million children worldwide each year and 
leaves many more blind or afflicted with lung disease 
the research conducted in south africa found that the vitamin 
reduced the death rate by more than half and the duration of 
pneumonia diarrhea and hospitalization by about onethird 
the results indicate a remarkable protective effect of vitamin 
a in severe measles the doctors wrote 
earlier research has turned up circumstantial evidence that the 
vitamin helps as a result the world health organization three 
years ago recommended that young measles victims take vitamin 
supplements anywhere that vitamin a deficiency is common or that 
more than 1 percent of measles cases are fatal 
the study published in todays new england journal of medicine 
was conducted by drs gregory d hussey and max klein of the 
university of cape town 
the study randomly assigned 120 milligrams of vitamin a or 
identicallooking placeboes to 189 children who were hospitalized 
because of measles complicated by pneumonia diarrhea or croup 
of the 12 children who died 10 were taking placeboes 
all children with severe measles should be given vitamin a 
supplements whether or not they are thought to have a nutritional 
deficiency the doctors wrote

the five men and a woman members of the 701st military 
intelligence brigade at augsburg west germany were arrested in 
this pensacola suburb over the weekend they are being held at fort 
benning ga pending a counterintelligence investigation 
all six held topsecret security clearances and were 
intelligence analysts assigned to intercepting identifying and 
exploiting foreign communications padilla said 
maj joe padilla an army spokesman at the pentagon wednesday 
retracted an earlier statement that the six were members of a group 
known as the end of the world 
there is no group as far as we can tell padilla said 
the term end of the world was written on doodles found in 
the room of one of the soldiers in germany padilla said he said 
he didnt know why they left germany or anything about their 
religious beliefs 
said grant i dont want to talk down to anyone about anyone 
elses religious beliefs but they said if they werent on the 
beach in pensacola they wouldnt go to heaven 
he said he sold the them a van july 7 in morristown near

annette eccleston 22 whose hometown was unknown 
the army has yet to file any charges against the six but 
padilla said he doubted they would be going back to their unit in 
germany he said they are accused of being absent without

nonpolluting 300mileanhour magnetic 
levitating trains could be whisking passengers between some us 
cities before the end of the 1990s the federal railroad 
administrator predicts 
the country may be entering a new era in ground transportation 
with projects already beginning in california nevada and florida 
said gilbert e carmichael who heads the federal railroad 
administration 
several other areas also are looking into magnetic levitation or 
highspeed rail he said 
carmichael in an interview wednesday discussed an fra report 
completed this week that said magnetically levitated trains are 
feasible for the united states even without significant federal 
funding 
no magnetic train yet carries paying passengers anywhere in the 
world but carmichael said he recently rode on a 19mile test 
system in west germany 
you feel it levitate and then you feel it swoosh you along 
without any vibration carmichael said cows were grazing 
underneath when we passed over and they didnt even look up 
because the trains float on a powerful magnetic field there is 
no friction or wear and far less energy is consumed it takes about 
as much electricity to run the german system as to aircondition 
it carmichael said 
fares would be about 20 percent below air fares and on some 
shorter routes 40 percent lower the administrator said 
the report said the united states which started and then 
abandoned the maglev technology two decades ago still could 
create a better system than those being tested in west germany and 
japan the system is intended as an alternative to shortdistance 
air travel 
carmichael said he expects at least two maglev routes to be in 
operation before the end of the decade along with two or three 
highspeed rail systems 
but he said the decision must be made whether to invest 1 
billion to develop a new us system to get into a joint venture 
with a foreign system that already is well along or simply to buy 
either the german or japanese products 
maglev technologies are in competition with highspeed rail 
which is a fast steelonsteel system and with swedish tilting 
trains that allow faster service on existing tracks without 
passengers feeling the curves 
carmichael said all of the systems can be used along with 
tiltrotor aircraft in a multimodal approach to preventing 
transportation gridlock next century 
the fra study said any heavily traveled route of 100 to 500 
miles holds potential for the magnetic system 
a system of up to 2600 miles could be built for about 55 
billion with taxfree bonds and no public financing assuming 
rightsofway are available at little or no cost the report said 
an advisory panel to the senate committee on environment and 
public works recommended a year ago that the government allocate 
750 million over six years to develop test and demonstrate 
several maglev routes 
the federal budget so far calls for only 12 million to further 
study the potential for highspeed trains 
but there are signs of growing support from industry 
on monday a partnership headed by bechtel international inc of 
san francisco put up 500000 for the right to bid on a 5 billion 
maglev train between southern california and las vegas planners 
hope to have the train running in seven years 
business and government leaders in pittsburgh are moving to make 
the city a technological and manufacturing base for the 
germandeveloped maglev system while developing a 19mile 
demonstration run between downtown pittsburgh and the citys 
international airport 
another privately funded project in florida is planning to build 
a 14mile german system by 1994 to link orlando airport to disney 
world and other nearby resorts 
carmichael said at least two companies are bidding to develop a 
highspeed rail system in texas to link houston and dallas 
the fras report envisions five maglev systems that eventually 
could be tied together 
they include a giant web in the northeast running from boston to 
richmond va and going as far west as minneapolis and st louis 
in the south the floating trains would zip from nashville down 
to miami and from charlotte across to birmingham 
the californianevada system eventually would link reno 
sacramento san francisco and san diego to the already planned los 
angeleslas vegas line 
a northwest system would tie portland to seattle and the 
dallashouston line would connect to san antonio and austin

president bushs decision to end recognition 
of rebels battling cambodias vietnamesebacked government and 
open talks with vietnam instead is being welcomed in congress 
but some lawmakers say it doesnt go far enough 
us policy requires overhaul and intensive effort not 
tinkering and fleeting attention senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine said wednesday he called past policy a dismal 
failure 
sen david boren dokla chairman of the senate intelligence 
committee called for an end to covert us aid to cambodias rebel 
coalition 
secretary of state james a baker iii announced wednesday in 
paris that the united states would withdraw its support for the 
threeparty coalition that is fighting the vietnameseinstalled 
phnom penh government 
that coalition includes the khmer rouge which was responsible 
for more than 1 million deaths during its reign in cambodia in the 
1970s 
baker also said the united states would begin a dialogue with 
vietnam about the need for a political solution to cambodias civil 
war and would allow ussponsored humanitarian programs 
including 5 million in aid for children to go forward inside 
cambodia 
the moves were seen as adjustments to a new reality in cambodia 
where a potential takeover by the brutal khmer rouge has become a 
larger worry than fears of encroachment by neighboring communist 
vietnam 
but in a letter to mitchell baker also said it is more 
important than ever to provide us materiel support for the 
noncommunist resistance who should not be undercut just as they 
seek to provide the only noncommunist alternative in free 
elections 
the united states now provides 7 million openly to the 
resistance for nonlethal supplies and an additional 13 million a 
year in covert military aid for the coalition according to 
intelligence sources 
both payments are under attack in congress because while the 
aid ostensibly supports the coalition faction of prince norodom 
sihanouk critics say it at least indirectly helps the khmer rouge 
which is the countrys strongest military force 
several opponents of us policy said continuing the aid was 
inconsistent with other moves by the administration 
the administration has eliminated the rationale for their 
policy of support for the noncommunist resistance but on the 
other hand has increased its resolve to provide assistance thats 
a contradiction said rep chester atkins dmass 
citing reports that the khmer rouge is gaining ground on the 
battlefield mitchell said there is simply no excuse to delay 
additional action that would go beyond bakers announcement 
among actions mitchell sought was direct us talks with the 
phnom penh government of hun sen rather than his vietnamese 
sponsors in hanoi who are in turn supported by the soviet union 
and he said bush should be more willing to apply pressure to 
china the chief supporter of the khmer rouge and to do so 
publicly the chinese leadership must be made to understand that 
it stands entirely alone in support of genocidal forces he said 
boren did not directly refer to the covert military aid program 
that goes through his intelligence committee but he said that all 
us support for the resistance should be handled openly 
any future debate on our policy toward cambodia should be in 
the foreign relations committee not in the intelligence 
committee which meets behind closed doors boren said 
the intelligence panel voted june 28 to cut off the covert aid 
program beginning oct 1 
boren said he assumed the policy shift is a signal that the 
administration would no longer be seeking any aid that could be 
even indirectly helpful to the khmer rouge that will require the 
administration to shift its budget request to support humanitarian 
programs and democracybuilding moves he said 
under us pressure the united nations has awarded a seat to 
the cambodian resistance coalition and denied formal recognition to 
hun sen 
baker said the united states also was changing its policy toward 
the cambodian un seat

american voters are concerned about childrens 
issues and would be willing to support candidates and increased 
funding of programs to help them according to a survey released 
today 
however the study said that translating voter concern into 
action has been lacking because public knowledge has yet to catch 
up to the reality of childrens lives 
a betterinformed public may provide greater political 
momentum for enhanced public programs for children said the 
study titled kids clout americans attitudes on childrens 
issues 
the study published by the national association of childrens 
hospitals and related institutions discusses how concern for 
children can influence voting behavior 
the association found 60 percent of americans believe the 
quality of childrens lives has become worse over the past five 
years and more than one american in four believes that it has 
become much worse 
sixtynine percent or twothirds recognized that 20 percent or 
more children have no health insurance but only 11 percent could 
differentiate medicaid from medicare as the government health 
program that serves poor children 
however when the confusion was cleared up support for this 
program medicaid ranks near the top of many americans spending 
priorities with 58 percent ranking it at 6 or higher on a scale 
of one to 10 with 10 being the highest priority 
the study showed americans also would be willing to pay 
increased taxes to pay for health insurance for poor children 
a majority 59 percent would be willing to have their taxes 
raised the 100 per year it is estimated to cost to give all poor 
children health insurance said the study 
further 67 percent said they would be more likely to vote for 
a candidate who supported increased spending for childrens 
programs even if it meant an increase in their taxes 
both men and women favored more overall spending on childrens 
programs but parents are more likely than nonparents to support 
increased spending on childrens health 
the study was the result of a june 917 telephone survey of 
1000 adults commissioned by the association the margin of error 
was plus or minus 31 percentage points

the rejoining of east and west germany will 
mean some changes for us agricultural exporters an agriculture 
department trade expert says 
east germany has imported up to onefourth of its annual grain 
needs said steven yoder of the departments foreign agricultural 
service part of that has been us corn and durum wheat for pasta 
and sometimes some oilseeds 
but when east germany is united with west germany and becomes a 
part of the european economic community were likely to lose 
those grain markets regardless of what happens to east german 
grain production yoder said 
yoder recently visited both east and west germany for a 
firsthand look at farm production and markets he was us 
agricultural attache in east germany during 198084 
the other thing weve got to do is establish a strong presence 
for us farm and food products in the east german marketplace 
before our competitors get it all sewn up he said 
yoder said traders from west germany and other western european 
countries are moving into the market in a big way with consumer 
food products 
the west germans or course have a language bond with the east 
yoder noted some have lived in east germany and can go back to 
renew contacts 
sure the market is not without risk yoder said there 
are no guarantees in such an unsettled situation however there 
are a lot of opportunities up for grabs too 
the main thing he added is that us traders cant sit back 
and wait for everything relating to newtomarket food products to 
jell 
yoders remarks were in the forthcoming august issue of 
agexporter magazine published by the usda agency 
according to department export records about 745 million 
worth of us agricultural commodities mostly grain were exported 
to east germany in calendar 1989 sales to west germany by 
comparison were about 1 billion 
yoder noted that east germany is a small country with about 16 
million people but has many needs west germanys population 
is around 61 million 
for example he said the east german diet has always been 
largely a meatandpotatoesandbread affair milk and milk 
products including cheese also are available although not up to 
the quality expected in the west 
but supplies of fruits and vegetables are much less than 
desired and theres a wideopen market for highvalue processed 
products ranging from ketchup to ice cream

exports of us farm products declined 
seasonally in may to an estimated 326 billion but were still 
running ahead of a year earlier according to agriculture 
department analysts 
the may export estimate which was down 145 million from april 
dropped as the result of lower values for dairy products wheat 
rice grain sorghum animal feeds soybeans and cotton 
a monthly report by the departments economic research service 
said wednesday that those declines more than offset increases in 
may for corn barley live animals meat vegetable oils and 
horticultural products 
for the first eight months of the fiscal year that began last 
oct 1 however export values totaled about 285 billion up 2 
percent from the comparable period in 198889 
corn exports in may rose to 54 million metric tons valued at 
667 million the soviet union was the largest market taking 
almost 15 million tons with japan second at 12 million tons 
other major corn markets in may included mexico south korea and 
taiwan 
wheat exports dropped for the second consecutive month to 19 
million tons valued at about 294 million shipments to the soviet 
union declined sharply to 288000 tons ranking third behind china 
and japan 
soybean exports in may plummeted 48 percent in volume from april 
to 621000 tons valued at 148 million that was the lowest monthly 
volume since last september but officials said soybean shipments 
generally drop off in the second half of the fiscal year 
cotton shipments fell 20 percent in may to 128000 tons 
following a 26 percent drop in april the report said however the 
export value increased to 1628 per ton from 1573 in april 
the increase in the average cotton price was attributed to 
increased exports of higherpriced longstaple pima cotton 
declining shipments to china taiwan thailand indonesia and 
the european economic community more than offset increases to 
japan south korea hong kong and egypt the report said

the united states is changing the system for 
granting asylum to foreigners a move that might increase the 
number of requests it approves and remove political bias from the 
procedure 
the regulations will ensure that those who seek the 
protection of this country encounter a fair and sensitive legal 
process attorney general dick thornburgh said in announcing the 
reform on wednesday 
foreigners seeking asylum in the united states must be able to 
prove that if they are returned to their homeland they are likely 
to face persecution based on their political views their race or 
religion 
asylum requests currently are handled at immigration and 
naturalization service district offices by examiners who handle 
many kinds of immigration and visa applications under the new 
policy effective oct 1 asylum requests will be handled by 
specialists in washington 
the ins will designate 70 to 90 examiners who will be trained in 
international law and in conditions existing around the world so 
they may better decide upon asylum requests commissioner gene 
mcnary said at a news conference 
he said the ins also will open a documentation center that will 
have updated reports on conditions in various countries for 
examiners to use as reference 
supporters of the change say that by having its own 
documentation center the ins will rely less on the state 
department and thus may increase the number of asylum requests it 
approves 
the state department has infused the asylum process with 
foreign policy considerations and the ins has been unable to rise 
above its law enforcement ethos in order to examine the claims 
fairly said arthur c helton head of the refugee project of the 
lawyers committee for human rights 
the documentation center will draw on information about 
political conditions in foreign countries from a variety of 
sources including amnesty international and other human rights 
groups helton said 
the new procedures probably will mean more asylum applications 
will be approved he predicted 
mcnary said the number of asylum requests had increased from 
19000 in 1986 to a projected 65000 for 1990 of those requests 
28 percent are approved on the average every year he said 
about 85 percent of those seeking asylum in the united states 
are from latin america most of the remainder are from asia and 
ireland 
mcnary said the ins did not know if the new system would 
increase or lower the approval rate it will be a more accurate 
adjudication he said 
the system will cost between 7 million and 9 million a year 
and will be paid for mostly from fees the ins collects on various 
applications

it was not immediately clear whether she would be extradited to 
the united states 
tarita cheyenne brando a native of these south pacific islands 
is the daughter of brando and his current wife tarita teriipia 
the tahitian actress who played his love interest in the 1962

savings and loan defaulters could no longer 
protect their assets from government seizure by transferring them 
to a spouse or filing for bankruptcy under a proposal by house 
democrats 
unveiling the latest package in a flurry of proposals to answer 
mounting public discontent over the need for new taxes to address 
sampl losses democratic leaders said wednesday they also want a 
bipartisan commission to search out the root causes of the crisis 
they said their legislation would target people like bill l 
walters a former business associate of president bushs son neil 
walters defaulted on 106 million in sampl loans and then purchased a 
19 million home in newport bay calif through a trust in his 
wifes name 
there are no laws on the books that prevent that son of a gun 
from leading a fat life while the taxpayers are spending hundreds 
and hundreds of thousands of dollars because he got the money 
said rep charles schumer dny the author of the new proposal 
speaker thomas s foley dwash said schumers package would 
be included in an anticrime bill he plans to bring to the house 
floor next week 
meanwhile the resolution trust corp established by congress 
last year to manage the thrift bailout said it has referred about 
half of the 454 sampls seized by the government to the justice 
department for suspected criminal misconduct 
james dudine the rtcs chief investigator said wednesday his 
agency estimates that 80 percent of those cases involve fraud and 
insider dealing and warrant major criminal investigations 
walters according to government records defaulted on a total 
of 106 million in six loans from the collapsed silverado banking 
savings and loan association of denver 
as a director of silverado neil bush voted to approve all of 
the loans to walters after walters invested 150000 in bushs oil 
exploration company and extended a 175 million line of credit to 
the presidents son bush has denied any impropriety 
the 12member bipartisan study commission proposed by house 
democrats would be structured along the lines of the kerner 
commission established after inner city riots in detroit los 
angeles washington new york and other cities in 1968 
while the justice department has opposed an independent 
commission schumer voiced optimism that the administration might 
go along with the idea to defuse the current wave of electionyear 
sniping by democrats and republicans blaming each other for the sampl 
crisis 
people want answers and the atmosphere in congress has gotten 
kind of rancorous he said a commission could look into it and 
really get the answers to what happened this is a big enough 
crisis like civil rights and the problems of the inner cities 
were to deserve that kind of thing 
the democratic bill also would make the concealment of an sampls 
assets a federal offense and rewrite tax laws so that a defendant 
in a civil suit could not write off courtordered restitutions as 
an income tax deduction and it would prohibit banking executives 
from giving themselves socalled golden parachutes when they 
leave or change their jobs 
the senate toughened sampl sanctions as part of a crime bill it 
passed last week it voted to establish lifetime sentences for 
sampl kingpins convicted of fraud in cases where the government 
is left covering millions of dollars in losses of federally insured 
deposits 
the house bill creates new criminal offenses for concealing 
assets from government regulators or obstructing their 
investigations but leaves untouched the current maximum sentence of 
30 years for sampl fraud 
we tried to be as tough as possible without going off the deep 
end just for show said schumer predicting the package will win 
strong bipartisan support

scientists are closing in on the tiny bit of 
genetic code that makes a man a man and a woman a woman 
in a report published today a british team announced the 
discovery of a gene they call sexdetermining region y and said 
it may be the longsought sex trigger 
if biology works the way many scientists believe a single gene 
rules sexual development in the womb when an embryo inherits this 
gene from its parents it grows to be a boy when it doesnt it 
becomes a girl 
the search for this gene has been the subject of intense 
international competition between scientists a team from the 
imperial cancer research fund in london took the latest step 
but their chief rival a group from the whitehead institute in 
cambridge mass speculates that two or more genes lie at the 
heart of the differences between the sexes 
in 1987 whiteheads dr david page announced the discovery of a 
gene he called zfy he and many others believed it probably was the 
sex trigger but last december the london group proved that zfy 
was not the crucial gene at least not by itself 
in the british journal nature the london team said today their 
gene which they call sry for short is proposed to be a 
candidate for the elusive testisdetermining gene 
the evidence is good so far but i wouldnt stick my neck out 
until we have the rest of the data in said dr andrew sinclair 
the lead author of the report 
if pages scenario is correct his gene and the london groups 
discovery could turn out to be partners in triggering sexual 
differences like page the london group pinpointed its gene by a 
process of elimination 
everyone is born with 46 strings of genes called chromosomes 
two of these called x and y are the sex chromosomes women have 
two xs while men have an x and a y scientists reason that the 
gene that makes men different from women must be located someplace 
on the y 
scientists have concentrated on apparent exceptions to the rule 
socalled xx males to all outward appearances these people 
usually are physically normal men but their cells contain the 
double xs of women through a genetic mixup one of their xs 
contains a tiny fragment of y enough to make them men 
the london group narrowed the search to a narrow stretch of the 
y chromosome in which they have located one gene they cite several 
reasons to think that this is indeed the longsought sex gene 
while men have the gene women do not possess anything like it 
the gene actively makes a protein in mens sex organs but not 
in other parts of the body 
other kinds of male mammals have similar genes 
in mice the gene is turned on at precisely the moment in 
development when sexual differences appear 
critics of this work point out that some of the xx males who 
carry just the newly discovered gene have some but not all male 
sexual features to be completely male they argue that people need 
at least one more gene perhaps pages zfy 
this is a very important piece of work there is no doubt 
about that page said its just a question of whether we 
really know the number of genes on the y that are involved in sex 
determination 
adds dr robert erickson of the university of michigan my 
hunch is that it takes zfy to finish the job off 
dr peter goodfellow senior scientist of the london group said 
he is openminded about this genetics puzzle while the critics may 
be right he said another possible explanation is that his sry gene 
is the true sex trigger but it didnt work properly in the 
partially masculinized people he studied 
to settle the question the london team says two more pieces of 
research will be necessary one will be to check xy females women 
who appear genetically to be men to see if they are missing sry 
the other will be to implant the gene into female mouse embryos to 
see if this makes them become males

about 11000 refugees have found a haven at 
the voice of america radio station in liberia but despite fighting 
in the area the transmitter still relays the us governments 
programs to africa 
should the facility be damaged by fighting voa will lose about 
40 percent of its broadcasts to africa especially to the eastern 
and southern parts of the continent voa deputy director robert 
coonrod said wednesday 
the area around the facility near the town of careysburg about 
20 miles from the capital monrovia fell to the rebels last month 
in fighting against the troops of president samuel doe 
the station relays 20 hours of voa programs in swahili english 
french and portuguese each day the programs are usually 
transmitted by satellite to monrovia and then by cable to 
careysburg 
but with the recent failure of the earth station in monrovia 
coonrod said the broadcasts are now sent to careysburg by 
shortwave radio from the united states 
in recent weeks fighting has broken out around the station 
between the forces of charles taylor a former government official 
seeking to topple doe and renegades who broke away from taylors 
army 
coonrod said the station has been run by 100 liberians since the 
last of the american staff was evacuated about four weeks ago 
theyre doing a remarkable job keeping it going under 
incredible circumstances said coonrod were amazed 
he said the technicians are performing basic maintenance jobs on 
the transmitter getting instructions by shortwave radio from their 
boss in monrovia which is still under government control 
taylor has been sending refugees to the voa facility because he 
considers it a neutral site and also because the station has its 
own water sources that the refugees are using coonrod said 
the refugees are camping out on the grounds of the station 
which is located on a 2000acre jungle clearing and two liberian 
doctors are treating the ill and injured he said 
the voa buildings have been secured with metal bars on the 
windows but the staff has instructions to abandon the facility and 
save themselves if fighting spreads to the grounds of the facility 
coonrod said

the house ways and means committee is 
demanding that the beijing government improve its human rights 
policies before the united states renews special trade privileges 
for another year 
however the committee which originates all trade legislation 
in congress rejected an effort to withdraw the mostfavorednation 
trade benefits that president bush extended to china last month 
those benefits guarantee the lowest tariffs available on goods 
imported into the united states 
our object ought to be to improve human rights in china not 
to cut off trade rep donald pease dohio said wednesday in 
arguing successfully for his bill which the committee approved by 
voice vote 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the committee 
supported peases bill we are all outraged by human rights 
atrocities taking place in china but revoking trade benefits 
would be counterproductive he said 
rep richard schulze rpa made several unsuccessful attempts 
to toughen the bill 
despite the massacre of protesters in beijings tianamen square 
in june 1989 and other human rights violations the resolution 
says you get one more year to do a little better schulze said 
we have said we are going to turn our backs on it that the 
almighty dollar is much more important 
rep sander levin dmich described peases bill as an 
attempt to create enough common ground that the president and 
congress can stand on it together anything tougher almost 
certainly would be vetoed he said 
in granting the trade benefit this year bush had to consider 
only chinas emigration policy and was allowed by law to waive any 
concerns about it in the national interest the bill would not 
affect the designation for the next 12 months 
before renewing mostfavorednation status next year the bill 
would require the president to consider whether the beijing 
government has made significant progress in several areas they 
include 
terminating martial law 
accounting for citizens who were arrested as a result of 
nonviolent expression of political beliefs during the uprising that 
led to the tianamen square massacre 
easing restrictions on freedom of the press 
ceasing harassment of chinese citizens in the united states 
the president also would have to consider how denial of the 
trade benefit would affect hong kong the british crown colony that 
borders china 
some members quarreled with the significant progress phrase 
in the bill 
if you shoot 1000 people instead of 5000 have you made 
progress asked rep marty russo dill 
bipartisan legislation in the senate would withdraw 
mostfavorednation status outright on grounds the beijing 
government continues to engage in torture use of forced labor 
denial of emigration and suppression of domestic dissent as well 
as support of khmer rouge forces in cambodia 
almost all nations except developing countries whose exports 
are allowed tarifffree treatment have been given 
mostfavorednation status 
exceptions include cuba and vietnam

presidentelect alberto fujimori has named as 
his prime minister a former centerright cabinet minister the 
strongest signal yet that he is indeed embracing the tough 
marketoriented reforms he once eschewed 
fujimori on wednesday night named exagriculture minister juan 
carlos hurtado miller to be his prime minister and economics 
minister 
the presidentelect who takes over from centerleft president 
alan garcia on july 28 said hurtado miller would announce the rest 
of the cabinet this afternoon 
the appointment came two days after two of fujimoris top 
economic advisers resigned the two had supported a gradual 
economic adjustment program 
before the june 10 election fujimori sharply criticized the 
type of marketoriented economic shock therapy advocated by his 
opponent novelist mario vargas llosa 
but on subsequent visits to the united states and japan to seek 
loans fujimori was told drastic reform such as ending price 
subsidies and selling off unprofitable stateowned industry was 
needed in order to qualify for international credit 
fujimori has said one of his top priorities is to mend relations 
with international lenders 
the announcement came in a hastily called press conference held 
at a lima military base where fujimori has been meeting with 
advisers for the last week to choose a cabinet theyve been 
meeting at the base for security reasons 
a decadeold insurgency by maoistinspired shining path rebels 
has plagued a series of peruvian administrations though mostly 
centered in the countryside the rebels have in the past year or so 
tried to move their struggle into the capital 
hurtado miller who resigned wednesday from the centerright 
popular action party is a former bank president and served as 
agriculture minister under former president fernando belaunde terry 
from 1983 to 1985 
hurtado miller like fujimori is an agricultural engineer who 
also holds a masters degree in economics from iowa state 
university and masters in public policy and management from harvard 
fujimori said the priorities of his cabinet will be centered 
in the pacifying peru ending bureaucratic corruption cleaning up 
the economy promoting a fair policy of economic stabilization and 
the reinsertion of peru in the international financial community 
following meetings last month with heads of the international 
monetary fund the world bank and the interamerican development 
bank he promised to dismantle populist price subsidy programs and 
exchange rate controls imposed by presdident garcia 
those lending agencies cut off credit to peru after garcia 
stopped payments on the countrys 20 billion foreign debt 
fujimori said his cabinet would be made of leaders representing 
a broad spectrum of political parties but he gave no indication 
wednesday night who his ministers would be

a presidential decision to deploy the first 
phase of the strategic defense initiative in 1993 would be 
premature and fraught with high risk congressional 
investigators say 
citing design problems caused by the introduction of the 
brilliant pebbles concept of orbiting interceptors and detailed 
tests that wont be completed in time the general accounting 
office on wednesday recommended a delay in deployment of the 
antimissile system 
the report by congress watchdog agency is certain to affect 
debate over the level of spending on sdi commonly known as star 
wars the senate armed services committee in approving a 289 
billion fiscal 1991 defense bill cut 1 billion from president 
bushs 47 billion budget request for the program 
the house armed services committee which will craft its version 
of the bill later this month must slash a total of 24 billion 
from bushs overall budget of 307 billion to conform to house 
instructions a deep cut in sdi is expected 
in the report the gao said brilliant pebbles had 
drastically changed the systems design leaving it in a state of 
flux 
in january the pentagon incorporated the brilliant pebbles 
concept into phase 1 the technology involves several thousand 
interceptors that would orbit the earth to seek and destroy a 
target by smashing into it at high speeds 
the gao also said that detailed tests planned by the strategic 
defense initiative organization a defense department agency that 
oversees star wars wont be completed before the scheduled 
executive decision on deployment 
based on those problems the gao said it doesnt believe the sdi 
organization will be able to give the president enough 
information to support a 1993 decision to deploy phase 1 
the pentagon plans to spend between 69 billion and 87 billion 
to develop and deploy the first phase of sdi designed to protect 
the united states from a soviet nuclear ballistic missile attack 
defense secretary dick cheney has said the goal of phase 1 was 
to destroy half the soviet unions ss18 nuclear warheads 1540 
of the 3080 currently deployed and 40 percent of its other 
warheads launched in an initial strike against the united states 
the first phase involves seven highly integrated elements two 
spacebased sensors a spacebased weapon two groundbased 
sensors a groundbased weapon and a command and control system 
that would manage the other elements 
sdi officials believe they can support a decision to deploy 
phase 1 with less information but say it will be done at increased 
risk the gao said 
in a statement the sdi organization said its goals are to 
conduct a vigorous research and technology program that would 
be the basis for an informed decision by the president the agency 
said it would have no official comment on the report until the gao 
formally released it in early august 
rep john conyers dmich chairman of the house government 
operations committee said successful deployment depends on a 
sound stable design plan 
gaos report shows that no such plan exists because of the 
radical changes made recently by the inclusion of brilliant pebbles 
into the design caution and skepticism are appropriate when 
congress looks toward funding the completion of phase 1 said 
conyers who requested the report 
the gao noted the absence of scrutiny the pentagon envisioned 
for the program the defense acquisition board didnt conduct its 
scheduled 1989 review and has not assessed the affect of brilliant 
pebbles on the design and tests 
the lack of effective agency oversight has contributed to the 
failure of other automated weapons systems none of which matches 
the scale and technological complexity of phase 1 the gao said 
consequently any executive decision in 1993 to deploy phase 1 
would be premature and fraught with high risk 
the gao recommended that cheney advise president bush to defer a 
decision to deploy any element of the phase 1 system until the sdi 
organization has stabilized the design and shown the systems 
effectiveness through testing

a national research council report says a plan 
for an underground dump for highlevel nuclear waste is bound to 
fail because it requires an assurance of safety that science 
cant guarantee 
the report said a us policy requiring the department of energy 
to build a deep underground nuclear dump that is absolutely assured 
of being safe for 10000 years is a scientific and engineering 
impossibility 
a policy that promises to anticipate every conceivable 
problem or assumes that science will shortly provide all the 
answers is bound to fail the study said 
it notes that the 10000year requirement covers a period that 
is as long as all of recorded human history 
the study said federal law should give doe more flexibility to 
allow for uncertainties found while building such a large project 
that has never before been attempted 
however melinda kassen a lawyer for the environmental defense 
fund said her organization and other environmental groups believe 
the standards now in place should be enforced and that a policy 
demanding firm evidence of safety is the correct approach 
there is wisdom we believe in trying to assure up front that 
youre not going to have contamination or catastrophe down the 
road ms kassen said in a telephone interview before putting 
nuclear waste in the ground you ought to show that the system is 
going to work 
the national research council study said the effect of current 
laws is that doe managers feel required to do things perfectly 
the first time while preparing an underground depository for 
highlevel radioactive wastes the report said federal experts are 
not given the flexibility to find ways to cope with unexpected 
geological features or to incorporate new scientific knowledge 
this rigid approach the study said creates a scientific 
trap by encouraging the public to expect absolute certainty 
about the safety of the repository for 10000 years and encouraging 
doe program managers to pretend that they can provide it 
engineers are unable to anticipate all of the potential 
problems that might arise in trying to site build and operate a 
repository the report said nor can science prove that a 
repository will be absolutely safe 
the doe has studied a number of candidate sites for underground 
nuclear waste storage 
in 1987 congress designated a site at yucca mountain in nevada 
for detailed study if the site meets standards established by the 
law it could be licensed as the first underground repository for 
thousands of tons of highlevel radioactive waste created annually 
by nuclear power plants 
congress in 1982 assigned doe to design and operate an 
underground depository the law says the site must licensed by the 
nuclear regulatory commission and meet environmental protection 
agency standards that limit release of radiation to levels that 
would cause fewer than 1000 deaths over 10000 years 
this perfect knowledge approach is unrealistic given the 
inherent uncertainties of this unprecedented undertaking and it 
runs the risk of encountering showstopping problems and delays 
that could lead to further deterioration of public and scientific 
trust the national research council said in its report 
requiring predictions of safety so far into the future the 
study said stretches the limits of geology groundwater 
chemistry and other sciences 
as a consequence the resulting estimates are uncertain to 
some degree and they will remain uncertain no matter how much 
additional information is gathered the report said 
the american people the study said should understand such 
uncertainties 
the public has been told too often that absolute guarantees 
can be provided but most citizens watching the human frailties of 
their governments and technologists know better the report said 
a realistic and attainable goal is to assure the public that 
the likelihood of serious unforeseen events is minimal and that 
the consequences of such events will be limited 
the national research council is an agency of the national 
academy of sciences a private organization chartered by congress 
to advise the federal government on scientific matters

us industry will be allowed to share 
technology developed in nuclear weapons laboratories as part of a 
growing governmentprivate sector partnership energy secretary 
james watkins says 
without the ability to manufacture highquality goods america 
is out of the competition watkins said as he signed two 
technologytransfer agreements with business consortia on wednesday 
the initiatives follow enactment last year of legislation 
encouraging such exchanges 
japan and a number of european countries are way ahead of us 
in government encouragement of private industry said sen carl 
levin dmich these agreements will unlock technology now in the 
hands of the government and make this country more 
competitive 
the energy departments weapons program consists of 17 
laboratories production facilities and test sites in 12 states it 
has over 100 billion in assets and a yearly research and 
development budget of about 3 billion 
the program is one of a handful in government that advance 
technology from the basic research stage all the way to product 
application it has generated some of the worlds most 
sophisticated manufacturing equipment machine tools control and 
measurement systems and quality assurance methods watkins said 
one agreement commits the energy department to share information 
with the national center for manufacturing sciences a nonprofit 
consortium based in ann arbor mich it represents more than 100 
companies 
taxpayers have invested 100 billion in americas national 
labs and production complexes over the years and they represent 
one of the worlds great treasure houses of technology and 
manufacturing knowhow said ed miller president of the center 
under the second agreement a consortium of 10 companies plus 
universities and the energy department will conduct research on 
specialty metals at the sandia national laboratories of 
albuquerque nm 
specialty metals are combinations of metals and alloys or other 
materials such as ceramics that are designed to meet strict 
qualitycontrol standards for highly complex products they are 
used in aircraft satellites nuclearpower reactors and highspeed 
drills 
the sandia lab will give industry and university researchers 
access to the only 310kilowatt electronbeam melting furnace of 
its size in the nation available for pure research 
the agreement with the center in ann arbor will boost research 
into advanced robotics techniques for manufacturing pollution 
cleanup technology and highspeed machine technology miller said 
some of the centers member companies already are working with 
the lawrence livermore national laboratory in california to develop 
a grade of aluminum that could revolutionize automobile 
production through more precise engineering miller said 
youre talking about multibilliondollar impacts to the 
productivity and quality of products he said people with the 
biggest companies in the united states general motors ford 
have already visited the laboratories and have said theyll use 
this technology if they can get access to it

authorities have arrested a fugitive student 
leader of last years crushed prodemocracy movement later set up 
an underground organization to agitate for reforms the students 
university confirmed today 
a student source meanwhile said a second protest leader had 
been placed in solitary confinement for trying to organize a hunger 
strike among prisoners 
an official at the student affairs office of the beijing 
economics institute contacted by telephone confirmed unofficial 
reports that fugitive student zhai weimin had been arrested and 
jailed but said she had no details she did not give her name 
zhai is the fourth beijing student known to have been arrested 
without publicity in the past three months even as the government 
tries to ease foreign criticism by announcing large prisoner 
releases 
the other three were students at beijing university suspected of 
involvement in underground activities 
the student source who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear 
of official punishment said zhai was placed in beijings qincheng 
prison for political prisoners in may 
that was just three months after zhai held a secret conference 
in beijing of his underground democratic front for the salvation of 
china participants in the conference told foreign journalists at 
the time that more than 60 people took part 
the front was one of several small underground groups 
established across china to agitate for reform after communist 
authorities ordered an army attack on studentled demonstrators in 
beijing on june 34 1989 ending seven weeks of massive 
prodemocracy protests hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed 
zhai 22 from central chinas henan province was a student at 
the beijing economics institute when the student protest movement 
began in april 1989 he quickly became one of its leaders 
after the army attack the government issued a list of 21 
mostwanted student protest leaders zhai no 6 on the list 
already was in hiding 
another protester on that list liu gang who has been jailed 
since june 1989 was moved to solitary confinement at qincheng 
prison in may the student source said 
he said liu had tried to organize fellow prisoners in a hunger 
strike on june 4 to commemorate the slain protesters 
liu 29 had been working at a research institute when the 
protests began but quickly joined the students 
the student source also said two more fugitives on the list of 
21 wang zhixin of the china university of political science and 
law and wang youcai of beijing university were in prison he did 
not know when they were arrested 
both universities said they had no information on the two 
students police have refused to comment on arrests 
eight students from the list of 21 were previously known to be 
arrested the arrests of zhai and the two wangs would bring that to 
11 two students on the list who were arrested last summer have 
since been released five on the list have fled abroad and the 
whereabouts of five are not known 
the government has said that 355 people who are still being 
investigated remain jailed in beijing in connection with the 
prodemocracy movement 
it has not released figures for people charged and awaiting 
trial or already tried and sentenced 
chinese sources say several intellectuals have received 
sentences of eight to 10 years in prison 
shanghai mayor zhu rongji visiting the united states to drum up 
foreign investments said last week in washington that fewer than 
10 people are still being detained in his city in connection with 
the protests 
no figures have been issued for the rest of the country but 
thousands are known to have been arrested nationwide the 
government has announced the release of a total of 881 prisoners in 
beijing and shanghai 
chinas policy since the winter has been to try to wrap up as 
many cases as possible releasing those it considers lesser 
offenders beginning prosecution of alleged ringleaders and sending 
abroad some of the most famous dissidents astrophysicist fang 
lizhi and folk singer hou dejian

ousted hardline communist leader todor 
zhivkov seeking to head off a possible trial on charges he abused 
power has asked to speak before parliament about his rule 
lawmakers agreed wednesday to allow the 78yearold zhivkov to 
address a session but did not set a date 
zhivkov is ready to stand before the grand national assembly 
and tell the bulgarian people the truth about his 35 years in 
power rumen vodenicharov head of the association for the defense 
of human rights told parliament 
zhivkov in the message read by vodenicharov also appealed to 
the assembly to stop the official probe into his past he has been 
under investigation for alleged abuses of power and 
misappropriation of state property he has also been accused of 
fomenting ethnic unrest 
zhivkov was ousted in november by reform communists he has 
since been under virtual house arrest or in the hospital 
along with erich honecker of east germany zhivkov is the only 
surviving ousted eastern european hardline leader to face possible 
prosecution it is doubtful that the ailing 77yearold honecker 
would ever be brought to trial 
earlier this month the chief prosecutors office announced that 
it expected to complete its preliminary investigation of zhivkov 
this week the prosecutor would then have a month to decide whether 
to put zhivkov on trial and if so set a date for the proceedings 
zhivkov was the author of socalled bulgarization or 
persecution and forced assimilation of the nations 15 million 
ethnic turks and other native bulgarian muslims 
after his ouster he was accused of corruption when it was 
revealed he had maintained at least 30 holiday and hunting retreats 
throughout this poor balkan nation of 9 million people 
zhivkovs oftenviolent forced assimilation policy banned moslem 
religious practices and required ethnic turks and moslems to 
forsake their own names and take bulgarian ones 
it was overturned by the reformed communists who deposed him 
at wednesdays session the assemblys newly elected chairman 
nikolai todorov proposed appointing a commission to investigate 
allegations of irregularities in last months multiparty elections 
the first free elections in bulgaria in 58 years 
he also proposed establishing a commission to work out new rules 
of parliamentary procedure and making personnel changes in the 
supreme court and other courts 
in last months elections the ruling socialist party formerly 
the communists won 211 seats for a majority in the 400member 
parliament the main opposition coalition the union of democratic 
forces took 144 seats 
while foreign observers could not confirm initial allegations of 
widespread manipulations the central electoral commission received 
a list of complaints about local irregularities in the balloting 
the parliament must also choose a new national president to 
replace petar mladenov a socialist who resigned earlier this 
month under public pressure after a videotape was released in which 
he was heard to call for the use of tanks against antigovernment 
demonstrators in december tanks were not used 
it was not clear when the parliament would vote for a new 
president

the father of a leukemiastricken boy says hell 
appeal a judges refusal to force the childs twin halfsiblings to 
be tested as possible bonemarrow donors 
tamas bosze says a bonemarrow transplant is the only hope for 
saving the life of his 12yearold son jeanpierre 
bosze sought a court order after the 3yearold twins mother 
nancy curran his former girlfriend objected to the blood tests 
tests doctors say family members have a better chance of being 
compatible donors than strangers 
the predicament of jeanpierre boszes son by another woman 
evokes sympathy from all whove heard the story cook county 
circuit judge monica reynolds said in a written ruling 
but the judge said an order forcing the twins to submit to a 
blood test and possibly to a bone marrow harvesting at a later date 
would be an invasion of their constitutional rights of privacy 
to subject a healthy child to bodily intrusions against the 
will of the custodial parent in order to attempt to save a diseased 
child is not a duty the courts can impose upon a child or 
anyone else the judge wrote 
bosze said he was disappointed but would appeal 
this is not over he said 
ms currans attorney beverly pekala said her client felt 
vindicated by the judges decision but remains fearful that the 
tests would endanger her twins lives ms curran was not in court 
dr jong j kwon jeanpierres physician argued that the 
potential to save the boys life outweighs the slight risks 
including pain possible anemia or infection involved in testing 
and then extracting bone marrow 
jeanpierres parents and other family members were found to be 
incompatible donors kwon said the boy diagnosed with leukemia in 
1989 is not improving and he must undergo several doses of 
chemotherapy a week 
kwon said he is trying to keep the boys spirits up 
i told him that transplantation has the best chance but even 
if the twins are not the donor we can still look for some other 
volunteer donor kwon said we cannot say there is no hope

the children ranging in age from 6 months to 22 months have 
been diagnosed with neuroblastoma a cancer of the adrenal glands 
and sympathetic nervous system that occurs primarily in children 
under age 10 the sympathetic nervous system controls some 
automatic body functions 
state health experts are studying medical records and the 
incidence of cancer in taylorville a city of 11000 people about 
210 miles southwest of chicago 
the childrens parents and others in the community suspect the 
cancer cluster is linked to an abandoned factory site that was 
contaminated with coal tar the affected children all live within 
three miles of the site 
its too much to be a coincidence said brenda may whose 
7monthold daughter erika was diagnosed with neuroblastoma soon 
after birth and underwent successful surgery to remove a tumor 
a second child 22monthold zachary donaldson has been 
declared cured 6monthold chad hryhorysak is undergoing 
chemotherapy 
symptoms include weight loss body aches paleness and 
irritability in some cases tumors cause diarrhea and high blood 
pressure the condition can be fatal if left untreated but is 
usually caught in time 
residents have formed the taylorville awareness group to press 
for government investigation of the cancer cluster 
at a town meeting on the issue wednesday night state 
toxicologist tom long told residents they shouldnt blame the 
abandoned factory yet 
it is right and good for you to be concerned about the cancer 
and your environment long said however at this stage of the 
game its not right or productive to link the two 
about half of the 50 residents at the meeting signed a petition 
asking the federal centers for disease control in atlanta to 
investigate state health officials said their own investigation 
would suffice 
before the meeting mrs may said that while she was pregnant 
with erika she often took her two older daughters to play in a 
park next to the former site of a central illinois public service 
co plant that made coal gas for street lights the plant shut down 
in 1932 
thomas hornshaw who assesses toxicchemical sites for the state 
environmental protection agency said 9000 cubic yards of coal tar 
and contaminated soil were removed from the site in 1988 
although the site is no longer contaminated residents could 
have been exposed before and during the cleanup he said 
studies have linked coal tar to lung and skin cancer but not 
specifically to neuroblastoma health officials said 
mrs may said she and other parents of cancerstricken children 
are resented by some residents who fear their town will be labeled 
a cancer hazard 
but they havent stayed up all night and watched a heart 
monitor to make sure their baby is still alive she said 
in the united states neuroblastoma occurs in about nine of 
every million live births every year according to the us centers 
for disease control fewer than 500 babies are born here every year 
about 500 cases are reported each year across the country and 
the prognosis is good if the cancer is diagnosed before age 2 
researchers dont know exactly what causes neuroblastoma but 
heredity plays a role and a virus or environmental factors might be 
involved said dr holly howe chief epidemiologist for the 
illinois department of public health

the army is reaffirming plans to ship several 
hundred tons of chemical weapons from storage sites in west germany 
to a pacific atoll for destruction in incinerators now being tested 
to meet federal environmental requirements the army had 
considered several alternatives including leaving the chemical 
weapons in germany or moving them to the united states for 
destruction at incinerators now on the drawing boards 
in announcing its decision wednesday to stick to its original 
plan for destroying the chemical agents on johnston island the 
army said the operation is expected to have minimal public 
health safety and environmental effects on johnson island and 
the pacific area the island is about 700 miles southwest of hawaii 
the army began testing the 240 million johnston atoll chemical 
agent disposal system on june 30 it halted the tests on the same 
day after encountering what army officials called minor problems 
testing resumed last weekend 
the plant is expected to start fullscale operations in 1992 
congress ordered the army in 1985 to destroy its arsenal of 
older chemical weapons including those in west germany by 1997 
the size of the stockpile is classified but is believed to be about 
30000 tons 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev agreed 
at their meeting in washington in early june to reduce their 
nations stockpiles of chemical weapons by 80 percent over the next 
decade

the labor department is looking into the 
possibility that its june unemployment report was leaked to traders 
in financial markets by a news service 
spokesman bob zachariasiewicz said wednesday that the matter 
involves a monthly report released july 6 on unemployment in june 
he said the departments action was not a formal investigation 
but a study of a report that the information had been leaked early 
and caused a fluctuation in market activity 
we had no way of telling that the market fluctuation was 
caused by a premature release of the information zachariasiewicz 
said 
just before the figures release one trader on the chicago 
board of trade began selling bond futures heavily according to a 
report wednesday by dow jones the selling spree could have been 
the result of a lucky guess or could indicate a premature leak the 
service said 
when the report is released each month news organizations are 
given copies at 8 am on the condition that they not be released 
until 830 am markets can rise or fall based on this information 
and its release even a minute prematurely has drawn the 
departments ire in the past 
zachariasiewicz declined to say which news organization was 
being reviewed but another labor department source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said it was a japanese service

an army officer charged with a 
coverup in the slayings of six jesuit educators their housekeeper 
and her daughter denies he ordered the burning of documents in the 
case 
im innocent lt col carlos camilio hernandez told 
reporters wednesday after asking a judge to postpone his hearing 
until a new defense lawyer is named 
i trust in god justice and my innocence since i didnt order 
the burning of any books he said 
hernandez is charged with destroying logs that may have 
contained evidence implicating nine army men including the former 
military school director col guillermo benavides in the november 
massacre 
the brutal slayings and sluggish investigation have prompted 
lawmakers in washington which backs the rightwing government of 
president alfredo cristiani with millions of dollars in aid to 
call for a funding cut 
hernandez lawyer carlos castellon resigned from the case 
wednesday claiming he had been threatened 
a prosecution lawyer said the log books are key evidence in 
the investigation because they show departures of army officers 
charged with leaving the military academy to kill the jesuits on 
nov 16 
the killings took place on the catholic university campus on the 
fifth day of the biggest guerrilla offensive in 10 years of 
salvadoran civil war 
cristiani and the army high command immediately blamed the 
killings on the guerrilla farabundo marti national liberation front 
but us army maj erick buckland told superiors that salvadoran 
col carlos armando aviles told him col benavides ordered the 
massacre 
aviles later denied saying he knew who took part in the killings 
judge ricardo zamora has told the salvadoran foreign ministry to 
ask the us embassys permission for buckland to provide further 
testimony 
the investigations have led to the arrest of benavides 
hernandez two colonels two lieutenants and four enlisted men 
benavides is the highest ranking official of the salvadoran army 
ever accused of human rights violations in the history of the civil 
war no officer has been convicted on that charge 
the evidence against benavides to date consists of testimony by 
other army men charged in the case under salvadoran law such 
testimony cannot be admitted as legal proof

dr karl menninger who pushed psychiatry 
into the american mainstream and for more than six decades strove 
for the compassionate treatment of the mentally ill has died at 
age 96 
the pioneer died of abdominal cancer at stormontvail regional 
medical center on wednesday just four days before his birthday 
if psychoanalysis was born in vienna the child of sigmund 
freud it grew strong on the kansas prairie under the guidance of 
menninger friends and associates said he nurtured psychiatry into 
a medical speciality 
he was one of the first american psychiatrists to integrate 
psychoanalytic theory into his practice said dr elissa benedek 
president of the american psychiatric association 
menninger was once hailed by the association as the nations 
greatest living psychiatrist a hottempered excitable 
maverick he jolted popular thought with his theories on crime 
prisons and child abuse 
menninger grew up in topeka and attended harvard medical school 
he interned at boston psychopathic hospital returning to topeka in 
1919 
in 1925 he and his father charles and brother william 
converted a 13room farmhouse into a clinic which later became the 
renowned menninger with the largest training program in the world 
for psychiatrists 
my chief purpose in the beginning was to show you could treat 
insane people menninger once recalled everybody thought 
they were untreatable but i said they were being treated every 
day we demonstrated you could treat people in a better way 
menninger applied freudian principles to people who were 
mentally ill but not psychotic said philip holzman professor of 
psychology at harvard university before that such people were not 
considered worthy of treatment he said 
he entered psychiatry at a time when psychiatry was defining 
itself holzman said 
dr gertrude ticho who worked at the menninger for 18 years and 
is now in private practice in washington said menninger was one of 
the first psychiatrists to create an environment for psychiatric 
patients based on compassion and treatment 
menningers oncerevolutionary approaches to mental illness 
became standard as psychiatrists trained at menninger established 
their own practices ticho said 
in a sense he was a victim of his own success she said 
he trained at menninger so many people who went out and set up 
comparable clinics 
in 1930 menninger published the human mind which still is 
used as a textbook in 1938 he came out with man against 
himself a seminal volume that examines patterns of 
selfdestructive behavior 
menningers other books including love against hate the 
crime of punishment and what ever became of sin also drew a 
wide readership outside of psychiatry 
dr menninger brought psychiatry to the average person 
widening public understanding and acceptance of psychiatry as an 
agent of healing and help benedek said he wrote and spoke in 
the language of the average american making mental illnesses more 
understandable and less feared 
menninger also explored the relationship between the mind and 
the body between mental health and physical wellbeing 
menninger was perhaps the foremost pioneer in refuting the 
notion of two separate systems one body the other mind in human 
beings said longtime friend norman cousins who has written 
about on health for the layman 
he advanced the concept of a singular system in which both 
mind and body were constituent parts said cousins who teaches 
at the university of california medical school 
crime and reform dominated menningers thinking in later years 
he moved to chicago in 1966 serving as a consultant on prison 
affairs and helping set up a mental health center in downtown 
chicago he moved back to topeka in 1974 
psychiatrists attribute reforms in mental hospitals to 
menninger under his guidance topeka state hospital became a 
national model for state hospitals across the country holzman said 
compassionate care of the mentally ill is the thing that 
stands out with menninger said cousins who first met menninger 
in the late 1930s all you have to do is visit a lot of mental 
hospitals to realize we have not arrived at that form of 
treatment

an electricians manslaughter conviction 
for work that caused a fire and killed a 12yearold has 
implications for other electricians nationwide industry officials 
say 
richard e salz faced sentencing friday after a jury last month 
found him guilty of improperly installing a baseboard heating unit 
in the east haven conn home where the boy died 
i think the individual salz deserves what happens but to 
put the rest of my trade in jeopardy of manslaughter is asking a 
lot lou acampora president of the connecticut electrical 
contractors association said wednesday 
this sets a bad precedent it puts a lot of good electricians 
in jeopardy for making a mistake he said 
phil simmons executive director of the park ridge illbased 
international association of electrical contractors said i hope 
it has a sobering effect and that people realize they will be held 
responsible for their actions 
simmons said he knows of no other case in which an electrician 
was charged with manslaughter for a death resulting from electrical 
work he has done 
lawrence acquarulo an assistant state building inspector who 
testified at salzs trial said the electrician should have known 
his work was a fire hazard 
this was not just john q public making an honest mistake 
he said 
salz 49 from east haven faces a maximum prison term of 10 
years 
the boy burton gorman iii died of smoke inhalation in the fire 
dec 26 1988 at his grandparents home 
salz failed to get a permit for the work ignored the 
manufacturers instructions for installing the heater in the homes 
basement and committed more than a dozen electrical code 
violations acquarulo said 
salz connected the 120volt unit to a 240volt circuit box 
doubling the amount of heat that was supposed to come from the 
heater acquarulo said the unit overheated and ignited wall 
paneling investigators said 
salzs license as a contractor was revoked in july 1989 but the 
state electrical work examining board gave him a journeymans 
license allowing him to work under supervision

gov michael s dukakis who bragged about the 
massachusetts miracle during his failed presidential bid has 
signed a bill taxing myriad services to infuse the state with 
needed cash 
dukakis signed the bill wednesday behind closed doors this is 
not something to celebrate he said later 
taxes are like medicine he said nobody likes to 
prescribe them nobody likes to take them but taxes are part of 
what will be required to regain fiscal health in the state 
the measure raises state income and gasoline taxes and extends 
the 5 percent sales tax to hundreds of business services that are 
now exempt the new law is expected to generate 12 billion this 
fiscal year and an additional 18 billion next fiscal year 
state officials said residents will start feeling the effects of 
the law at the gasoline pump within 10 days and will start seeing a 
bigger bite out of their paychecks as early as three weeks 
opponents argued the state constitution forbids some of the 
sales taxes on services but the state supreme judicial court 
supported the concept in an advisory opinion tuesday 
the huge tax boost marks another chapter in the upanddown 
fortunes of dukakis and massachusetts two years ago dukakis was 
preparing to accept the democratic nomination for the presidency as 
he bragged about the massachusetts miracle 
but since then the economy has soured revenue has shrunk and 
state government has run up a deficit of more than 1 billion for 
last fiscal year massachusetts bond ratings have plummeted to the 
lowest in the country 
the only miracle that i can see is that working men and women 
up to this time have been able to keep their heads above water 
said house minority leader steven pierce the republican candidate 
for governor he said he will file legislation to repeal the tax 
package 
dukakis is not running for reelection

hopes faded today for hundreds of 
people missing and believed trapped under rubble three days after a 
devastating earthquake on the main philippines island of luzon the 
official death toll neared 500 
mondays quake which registered 77 on the richter scale 
toppled buildings and triggered landslides across a wide area north 
of the capital 
rescuers said there could be 250 more dead in the ruins of a 
school in cabanatuan city two flattened hotels in baguio and in 
this citys factory district where search operations have not 
begun 
that does not include others who may be in cars buses and 
trucks reported buried in landslides or hurled into ravines 
elsewhere on luzon in the temblor 
as many as 30000 people fled on foot from this mountain resort 
north of manila heading for the lowlands along a highway blocked 
by landslides an official said 
all roads to the city had been cut off iin the quake and 
authorities hoped to blast through remaining mudslides and open one 
today 
figures compiled by the office of civil defense and the red 
cross showed at least 490 people were killed and 1000 injured in 
the quake officials said two americans were among the dead and 
five were missing 
manila television stations reported that hundreds of thousands 
of people in central luzon lacked electricity drinking water and 
food and many were camped along highways for fear of aftershocks 
president corazon aquino ordered price controls on rice pork 
and other commodities in short supply throughout the affected area 
but survivors complained of pricegouging and food shortages 
especially hardhit was baguio 110 miles north of manila where 
1500 americans live officials said scores of people were believed 
trapped in eight hotels that were severely damaged 
american rescuers today said they halted search operations at 
the nevada hotel in baguio after recovering the bodies of richard 
finley an official of the us agency for international 
development and the wife of former education minister jaime laya 
both had been attending a usaid conference officials said about 
20 filipinos working for usaid were missing and feared dead in the 
hotel 
us officials said an american woman was killed but her name 
was withheld pending notification of kin 
the rescue effort at the nevada is over said john 
mitchell a fireman from miami fla who was among americans sent 
by the us government for the rescue effort nobodys alive in 
there 
mario sayocha a miner who volunteered to search through the 
hyatt said he was not optimistic the stench is terrible 
inside he said it can turn your stomach 
in manila highway secretary fiorello estuar said clearing 
operations along the road to baguio were hampered because 20000 to 
30000 people were using the highway to walk to the lowlands of la 
union province 
there were no estimates of the economic impact of the quake on 
the countrys struggling economy preliminary estimates ran more 
than 1 billion because many buildings hotels bridges and 
highways were destroyed 
in manila rep rolando andaya chairman of the house 
appropriations committee said he would propose a twoyear 
suspension of payments on the countrys 26 billion foreign debt to 
free funds for reconstruction 
the house resumes sessions monday after the summer recess and 
andaya said he expected the resolution to pass easily 
scores of workers were believed missing in factories of the 
baguio export processing zone where a building caught fire during 
the quake search efforts have not begun there because the plant 
was still smoldering 
in cabanatuan 60 miles north of manila british technicians 
using sensor devices found no signs of life today in the rubble of 
the sixstory philippine christian college 
hundreds of students and teachers were trapped when the building 
collapsed rescuers found 137 survivors and 60 dead in cabanatuan 
british rescuers said sensors indicated about 25 bodies remained 
buried there 
local officials told manila radio stations that numerous other 
victims were probably buried in landslides near baguio and 
elsewhere in the northern mountains 
in la union and tarlac provinces thousands of people slept in 
cars and in their yards because of damage to their homes and fears 
of another quake huge fissures of up to a halfmile cut highways 
throughout the area 
thousands remained camped in baguio city parks many with only 
umbrellas for shelter in the frequent thunderstorms 
we will just walk one woman said its dangerous on the 
road because of the landslides but it would be much safer than 
staying indoors

the coast guard absolved exxon corp of major 
blame in an oil spill in a new york harbor waterway last january 
but said workers who ignored an alarm added to the extent of the 
spill 
according to a report released wednesday a crack in an 
underwater pipeline caused the jan 1 leak of 567000 gallons of 
heating oil into the busy ship channel between staten island and 
new jersey 
the leak was not discovered immediately because a computerized 
leak detection system failed to shut off the oil flow and workers 
at the refinery disregarded alarms that oil was leaking the report 
said 
the report also concluded that dredging equipment probably 
dented the 12inch underwater pipeline which runs about 67 miles 
from a refinery to a terminal on the new jersey side of the arthur 
kill waterway 
exxon spokesmen did not immediately return calls 
federal and state grand juries in new jersey are still 
investigating the spill it was the first in a series of mishaps 
that have plagued the arthur kill and the adjacent kill van kull 
this year polluting the waters and shorelines endangering 
wildlife and disrupting ship traffic 
the exxon refinery was the scene of another spill wednesday a 
barge leaving the refinery at linden nj struck a docked barge 
and spilled about 37000 gallons of home heating oil into the 
arthur kill 
coast guard officials said the spill posed little risk to the 
environment they said hot weather would speed evaporation and the 
cleanup

a state campaign featuring those perky 
yellow happy faces on lapel pins has some state workers frowning 
the workers are complaining theyre being forced to wear the 
pins with the message yes we can over gov william donald 
schaefers name 
william h bolander director of council 92 of the american 
federation of state county and municipal employees said workers 
dislike the buttons because they think its a subtle way to 
endorse the governor in an election year 
some he said claim they were threatened with discipline 
including suspension if they refused to wear them 
state officials have denied that 
robert b sivert director of facilities management for the 
department of general services said wednesday that his july 6 
memorandum telling workers to wear the pins was a request not an 
order 
if they choose not to wear the buttons there is no 
disciplinary action thats going to be taken sivert said 
the campaign is aimed at encouraging all 70000 state employees 
to treat the public with kindness courtesy and concern 
were just talking about reminding employees that theyre 
important in the lives of others and that they make a difference 
i resent even the implication that theres any kind of 
relationship between a political campaign and this promotion 
said samantha k weiner a public relations consultant to the state 
department of personnel and the creator of the campaign 
asked why the governors name is on all the promotions 
materials weiner said because he is a maryland state employee 
and is representative of the promotional campaign

the south african government 
and the african national congress are close to an agreement that 
would pave the way for constitutional talks on ending 
whiteminority rule a report said today 
the star newspaper citing government officials said the two 
sides appeared to be on the verge of resolving problems that had 
been blocking talks including an anc demand for release of 
political prisoners 
the report which came a day after anc leader nelson mandela 
returned from a triumphant 14nation tour said mandela and 
president fw de klerk were likely to meet within days 
the star an englishlanguage newspaper has been supportive of 
de klerks reform efforts 
on his arrival at johannesburgs international airport on 
wednesday mandela said the world was behind the fight to end 
apartheid in south africa and that whiteminority government could 
not last much longer 
we return home full of hope for the future of our 
country mandela told cheering supporters the world is with 
us in wishing for the speediest resolution to the countrys 
problems 
government officials said today no date had been set for a 
meeting between mandela and de klerk but they expected contacts 
fairly soon 
mandela said he was optimistic the anc and the government were 
moving toward an agreement to end apartheid and give blacks 
political rights having held their firstever meeting in may the 
government and anc are trying to clear the way for fullscale talks 
they are one with us in demanding the end of apartheid now 
mandela said but he ruled out any concessions on the ancs refusal 
to end its armed struggle and accept a ceasefire for which the 
anc has set various conditions 
the conditions include the release of hundreds of prisoners the 
anc says are political internees 
the agreement between the government and ourselves is as soon 
as the government has removed the obstacles to negotiations 
then we would be prepared to consider the suspension of 
hostilities he told an airport news conference 
mandela and his aides said the anc had gained major political 
support on their sixweek tour of north america europe and africa 
but they gave few details mandela was lauded and idolized in the 
united states where vast crowds turned out to cheer him 
the anc said mandelas return from neighboring mozambique was 
delayed several hours after it received anonymous threats against 
its leaders and its offices 
anc officials said they received a message by facsimile mail 
saying july 18 1990 the last day of freedom for the anc inside 
the republic of south africa 
the message also claimed there were bombs on mandelas flight 
and at the airport scores of heavilyarmed police guarded the 
airport and searched for bombs but reported finding nothing 
rightwing white extremists who oppose plans to end apartheid 
have claimed responsibility for a series of bombings in recent 
weeks 
mandela looking tired was greeted by about 200 supporters and 
relatives on his 72nd birthday it was his first birthday in 
freedom after 27 years in prison for fighting the whiteminority 
government 
the supporters sang happy birthday dear leader and chanted 
anc 
asked how he was feeling on his birthday mandela who came down 
with a mild case of pnuemonia last week said i feel like a boy 
of 36 and the present i would like to have is votes for all 
mandela said if the government embraces major reforms the anc 
might be willing to consider asking that international economic 
sanctions on south africa be eased before a new constitution is 
negotiated 
his statement was in contrast to his strong demands on his 
overseas tour for no relaxation in sanctions 
mandela appeared more authoritative and commanding after his 
tour he was crisp with reporters and tartly declined to answer 
several questions in contrast to his more easygoing style in the 
past 
as part of reforms by de klerk mandela was released from jail 
in february and the anc and other antiapartheid groups were 
legalized de klerk has promised to end apartheid and share 
political power with the black majority

democracy easily won the may 27 election but the government has 
given no indication that it will hand over power or free ms suu 
kyi from house arrest 
witnesses said the youths shouted antigovernment slogans as 
they marched to the martyrs mausoleum hoisting the banner of ms 
suu kyis party 
the number of soldiers around her house has been increased in 
recent days western diplomats contacted in rangoon from thailand 
said

chinas foreign minister left today for saudi 
arabia where diplomats said the two nations would announce the 
establishment of diplomatic relations over the weekend 
winning recognition from saudi arabia would be a diplomatic 
triumph for beijing which has seen a sharp drop in exchanges with 
western nations since it used its army to crush prodemocracy 
demonstrations in june of 1989 
china has diplomatic relations with most other arab nations 
including the conservative states of oman kuwait and qatar it has 
been eager to establish formal ties with saudi arabia with which 
it already has trade links 
trade between saudi arabia and china totaled 319 million in 
1989 china exported 249 million in goods mainly textiles light 
industrial products and food and imported 70 million worth of 
goods including chemical fertilizer wheat and steel 
the official xinhua news agency reported without explanation 
foreign minister qian qichens departure for saudi arabia today it 
said he would also visit cyprus morocco and algeria 
diplomats in the saudi capital riyadh said the establishing of 
ties would be announced at a ceremony on saturday or sunday the 
diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity 
there has been a flurry of recent contact between the two 
countries including a visit to beijing last week by saudi prince 
bandar bin sultan 
the first indication that a change in sinosaudi relations was 
in the works came in 1988 when it was disclosed that beijing had 
sold intermediaterange ballistic missiles to saudi arabia 
the granting of saudi recognition to beijing would be a blow to 
the rival nationalist government in taiwan saudi arabia is one of 
only 28 nations that recognizes taiwan most of the others are 
smaller nations in africa and latin america 
indonesia this month announced plans to normalize relations with 
china after a 23year suspension 
the taiwan government has apparently been advised of saudi 
intentions 
a nationalist official said wednesday that saudi arabias king 
fahd had sent word of his plan to make certain adjustments in 
riyadhs relations with taiwan and the mainland 
the nationalist official vice foreign minister chen chienjen 
refused to disclose the exact contents of the letter but it was 
believed to express saudi arabias plan to switch recognition 
the nationalists lost a civil war on the mainland in 1949 and 
fled to the island province of taiwan but continue to maintain 
that they are chinas legitimate rulers

a judge has dismissed federal charges against 
a woman who investigators call the high priestess of a drug cult 
that sacrificed 15 people but she remains in jail facing state 
charges her lawyer says 
federal criminal court judge bernardo tirado dismissed charges 
of homicide resisting arrest and causing injuries to others that 
were filed against sara maria aldrete villareal 25 a former 
honors student at texas southmost college in brownsville her 
attorney horacio moyar quintanilla said wednesday 
she also had faced a fourth federal charge of criminal 
association the judge ruled that ms aldrete who has been jailed 
since her arrest in may 1989 would not have to face any further 
penalties regarding that charge which carries a sentence of six 
months to six years in prison moyar said 
court officials were not available for comment late wednesday on 
the judges ruling 
on tuesday federal prosecutors had recommended dropping the 
charges of homicide resisting arrest and causing injuries to 
others 
the federal charges stem from the may 6 shootout in mexico city 
in which ms aldrete and four other cult members were arrested and 
the cults alleged ringleader adolfo de jesus constanzo and his 
bodyguard were shot to death 
prosecutors said ms aldrete and constanzo and other cult 
members had made a pact to kill each other rather than face arrest 
they said she encouraged a fellow cult member to shoot constanzo 
and his bodyguard as police closed in on their hideout 
the judges ruling clears the way for ms aldrete to be 
transferred from a federal prison in mexico city to a state prison 
in matamoros moyar said in a telephone interview with the 
associated press 
she is expected to go on trial next week in matamoros where she 
faces tamulipas state charges including homicide drug trafficking 
and secretly burying people moyar said mexico does not have the 
death penalty she faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison 
moyar said he would fight transfering ms aldrete to the 
matamoros prison because he feared for his clients safety 
she doesnt want to go he said its dangerous there 
there are problems with the families of victims 
he also said he would seek to get the state charges dropped 
ms aldrete has maintained her innocence and denied that she had 
anything to do with the ritual slayings of 15 people including 
mark kilroy a 21yearold university of texas student whose 
mutilated body was found buried at a ranch near matamoros across 
the border from brownsville texas in april 1989 
mexican investigators have described ms aldrete as a witch 
involved in a mexican drug cult that made human sacrifices 
authorities say constanzo had overseen the ritual killings of 
the 15 men and boys at the ranch near matamoros in april telling 
members of his drug trafficking ring the deaths would give them 
spiritual protection from police police say ms aldrete took part 
in at least one of the ritual killings selecting the victim and 
supervising his murder

tour operators smarting from a drop in 
business have accused the united states of discouraging tourism in 
an effort to pressure kenyas oneparty government to adopt 
political reforms 
a us official denied the allegation which stems from state 
departments advice to americans on july 10 to postpone all 
nonessential travel to the east african nation following riots 
that left at least 28 people dead 
sam mwaura chairman of the kenya tour operators association 
told the government in a letter that it is our considered opinion 
that tourism is now being used to put pressure to bear on the 
government to achieve certain political objectives 
kenyan politicians have accused the united states and embassy 
officials in nairobi of backing advocates of multiparty politics in 
the oneparty state 
tourism is kenyas top foreign currency earner bringing the 
country 240 million in 1989 last year 713800 tourists mainly 
from europe visited kenya many of the tourists visit the nations 
game preserves 
in his letter mwaura urged the ministry of tourism and wildlife 
to seek ways of persuading the state department to withdraw its 
travel advisory 
mwaura wrote the letter tuesday a day after association 
executives met us embassy officials on the issue 
an embassy spokesman denied the united states was pressuring the 
kenya government 
the state department issues travel advisories to help american 
citizens make intelligent decisions they are not a political 
weapon 
the state department revised the advisory today but advised 
americans to excercise caution when visiting kenya 
mwaura said the state departments warning also had led to 
cancellations of bookings from several european countries and 
australia he said a similar but fairly mild warning by the 
british government had also contributed to those cancellations 
mwaura said one local company which he did not identify was 
losing 100000 daily in canceled bookings from the united states 
the us criticism of kenyas government was stepped up ealier 
this month when kenya detained without trial or charge seven 
advocates of multipary politics those detained indefinitely 
include two former cabinet ministers and the son of a former vice 
president

high school and college students now receive as part of the

results to a trump hot line from june 8 through june 10 showed 
that 5640 of 7802 calls came from two phone numbers at great 
american insurance co a subsidiary of lindners american 
financial corp 
lindner would not comment the newspaper said but a spokeswoman 
for him said the calls were made because lindner and others at the 
company admire trumps entrepreneurial spirit 
the newspaper said it studied phone records generated by airdata 
inc a callin service company because of some apparent

calls poured in ninetythree percent of those calls were 
protrump the newspaper said

sponsors of a bill to combat job bias fresh 
from victory in the senate say they would welcome a compromise to 
ease white house concern that the plan could lead to hiring quotas 
well continue to consider any proposals from the president 
sen edward m kennedy dmass the chief sponsor said wednesday 
night after the senate approved the measure 6534 but were not 
going to sacrifice the essential principles of this legislation 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater traveling with 
president bush in anaheim calif said the administration was 
disappointed by the outcome of the senates vote 
well work to change it in the house fitzwater said we 
still want a bill we can sign 
fitzwater later issued a statement saying that the president 
wants a bill that ends discrimination not one that starts a quota 
system 
in san antonio vice president dan quayle told reporters today 
the administration is not going to have a quota bill crammed down 
its throat disguised as a civil rights bill this is a quota bill 
pure and simple 
the bill is the top legislative priority of the civil rights 
movement it would effectively overturn five supreme court 
decisions on job discrimination handed down last year 
while kennedy said he would welcome the presidents support 
he also said the margin of victory suggested that it would be 
possible to override a veto if bush refused to sign 
ten republicans joined 55 democrats in propelling the measure 
through the senate while 34 gop senators voted against the bill 
the house judiciary committee is expected to start work within 
days on its version of the legislation whose provisions range from 
a ban on racial harassment in the workplace to punitive damages for 
victims of the worst kinds of employment discrimination 
the sharpest clashes however have come over a provision that 
would make it easier to challenge employment practices whose 
negative effects fall disproportionately on minority groups 
the supreme courts decision last year in a case involving a 
salmon cannery in alaska said such practices do not violate the law 
unless those filing suit can show they were not prompted by 
business necessity 
the bill would require the companies challenged in such suits to 
prove that the practices in question were justified by business 
necessity the provision is similar to the law as it was before the 
high court decision 
the administration some republican senators and business groups 
contend that the bills definition of business necessity combined 
with possible punitive damages that would frighten lawyers would 
lead to quotas 
sen pete wilson rcalif told the senate that corporate 
lawyers would look for ways to insulate their companies from the 
danger of such suits and tell executives better make certain 
that your percentage of the workforce matches the percentage of 
available applicants 
kennedy maintained throughout the debate that the bill would not 
lead to quotas he said experience before the supreme courts 
decision proved it 
the false hue and cry of quotas is a disservice to the 
president of the united states a disreputable tactic by those who 
dont care about civil rights for women and minorities kennedy 
said 
but he negotiated with white house chief of staff john sununu 
for weeks in an effort to alleviate administration concerns the 
last bargaining session broke up at midnight tuesday 
even then bush sent three republican senators from the white 
house to capitol hill on wednesday morning with a fresh proposal 
it failed to galvanize sufficient support 
sen john c danforth rmo said the hangup remained the 
definition of business necessity he said every combination 
of words has been tried 
we are now proceeding on the road to a certain veto 
danforth said this is a bill that can do a lot of good for a lot 
of people and it is going nowhere 
tempers frayed on the senate floor wednesday night republican 
leader bob dole rkan said he had never before voted against 
civil rights legislation but that this measure was being rammed 
down my throat 
he made it clear he was still upset that democratic sponsors won 
a time limit on debate before it began which gave republicans 
little time to present amendments 
in retaliation dole used a tactical move to bar moderate 
democrats from attaching some politically sensitive amendments they 
had wanted including a cap on punitive damages that had been 
sought as a way of easing concerns among small businesses

iraqs parliament has approved a plan to 
make saddam hussein the president for life and scrap planned 
elections iraqs official news agency reported today 
saddam has been tightening his grip on power while establishing 
himself as one of the arab worlds most ruthless rulers 
the 250member assembly dominated by saddams baath party 
approved the presidentforlife proposal at a threeday session on 
planned constitutional changes according to the official iraqi 
news agency monitored in nicosia 
the session ended wednesday but it was not clear from the 
report whether the measures were binding or the vote final no 
details were provided about the proposals 
saddam 54 had promised political reforms including a 
multiparty system and a free press following the august 1988 
ceasefire in the eightyear war with iran but todays report said 
lawmakers had altered a proposal that would have provided for 
iraqs first elections since it became a republic in 1958 
saddam had said he would run in the election whose date had 
never been set but no one had come forth to challenge him 
under the current constitution the president is elected by the 
10member revolutionary command council composed of senior 
officials of the baath party 
the current constitution was drawn up in 1968 when the party 
seized power in a coup saddam has ruled with an iron fist since 
july 1979 when he took over as president from gen ahmed al bakr 
a final draft of the new constitution is to be drawn up by the 
baath party and the 10man revolutionary command council headed by 
saddam 
saddam exercises neartotal rule over iraqs 17 million people 
through his vast security apparatus the inner circle of iraqs 
leadership is packed with saddams relatives by blood or marriage 
from his extended clan from takrit in northern iraq 
the baath party is ostensibly socialist and panarab but is now 
virtually devoid of any ideology beyond saddams policies 
saddam has turned his reign into a personality cult that has 
reached the realms of nearmythology photos and posters of him are 
everywhere it is a capital offense to insult him publicly 
iraqi dissident sources have claimed in recent weeks that as 
many as 40 senior military figures including a cousin of saddam 
have been arrested and probably executed in saddams latest purge 
there has been no independent confirmation of the reports 
since the ceasefire in the war with iran saddam has revived 
his ambitions to become the paramount leader of the arab world and 
has built up an arsenal of longrange missiles and chemical weapons 
that has drawn denunciations from the west and israel 
he has also taken a belligerent stand against violators of 
production quotas set by the organization of petroleu exporting 
nations 
this week saddam threatened to retaliate against kuwait and the 
united arab emirates with force for violating production quotas 
saying they were responsible for driving down prices and costing 
iraq 14 billion in lost revenues in the last year 
saddam accused quota violators of stabbing iraq in the back 
with a poisoned dagger

angry noncommunist cambodian 
guerrillas say the withdrawal of us recognition though intended 
to spur a peaceful settlement could force them closer to china and 
strengthen the khmer rouge 
china indicated today that it had no intention of joining the 
united states in changing who it recognizes and would continue 
aiding the khmer rouge the strongest fighting force in the 
threeparty resistance coalition 
cambodias government along with its vietnamese backers 
welcomed the us move but indonesia and thailand said it would 
not weaken the khmer rouge 
cambodia described the us action as paving the way for 
achievement of an early political settlement the nations 
official spk news agency said 
in wasington sen david boren dokla chairman of the senate 
intelligence committee called for an end to covert us aid to 
cambodias rebel coalition 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said wednesday 
that there is simply no excuse to delay additional action that 
would go beyond the bush administration announcement 
but resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk called the us 
move an act of very serious injustice and appealed to all 
governments to keep washington from trying to strip the coalition 
of cambodias seat in the united nations 
the coalition will now be more firm and fierce in their 
determination to continue to resist he said in a statement from 
north koreas capital pyongyang where he lives part of the year 
vietnam invaded cambodia in 1978 ending a fouryear reign of 
terror by a khmer rouge government that tried to force a radical 
agrarian commune on the population killing hundreds of thousands 
of people 
the government it installed has been battling insurgents for 11 
years the war has widened in recent months with the khmer rouge 
scoring victories 
reflecting fears of a khmer rouge takeover the bush 
administration announced wednesday that it was withdrawing 
recognition of the resistance coalition and opening a dialogue with 
vietnam on resolving the war 
vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach said his country 
was ready to negotiate with concerned countries on cambodia 
the official vietnam news agency reported today the cambodian 
governments spk news agency reported the us move without comment 
today 
cambodian peace talks have foundered with the guerrilla 
coalition rejecting the wish of the hanoibacked government of 
prime minister hun sen to remain in power during a transitional 
period before elections 
the guerrillas want to share power or have the united nations 
assume authority and sihanouk and the head of the third rebel 
faction former prime minister son sann have refused to abandon 
the khmer rouge 
they say the khmer rouge would only fight on if left out of a 
settlement 
sihanouk said the us move will only perpetuate the rule of a 
government that is a creature and creation of vietnam 
the vietnamese claim they withdrew all their troops in 
september but there is evidence vietnamese soldiers remain and are 
supporting government forces against the rebels 
in beijing today foreign ministry spokesman jin guihua said all 
cambodian factions must be included in any politicial settlement 
so long as vietnam does not withdraw all its troops from 
cambodia genuinely china will continue to support the cambodian 
people in their resistance against the foreign invaders he told 
a news conference 
jin did not specificially mention chinese aid to the communist 
khmer rouge but china is known to be their main weapons supplier 
he refused to answer questions about whether the us change in 
policy would prompt beijing to increase aid to the khmer rouge 
there was no immediate indication of whether washington intends 
to cut its nonlethal and covert military aid to the noncommunist 
factions 
a thai analyst involved in the aid program said the us 
decision will affect the khmer rouge politically but not militarily 
and might push them to concentrate on a military solution the 
official spoke on condition of anonymity 
indonesias foreign minister ali alatas said in jakarta that 
the six southeast asian countries involved in the cambodia peace 
process had been informed in advance of the us move but were 
doubtful it would lead to peace 
the khmer rouges 30000member army is reported to have struck 
in virtually every province in cambodia in an unprecedented 
escalation of the war attacking five provincial capitals in the 
south north and west in recent weeks

the government said today it has evidence 
about cocaine use by one of marion barrys security guards a city 
police officer who was the leadoff witness for the defense in the 
mayors drug and perjury trial 
assistant us attorney judith retchin said she wants to 
question police sgt james stays a member of the mayors security 
detail about his involvement with cocaine and mr barry her 
comments came in court with the jury out of the room 
us district court judge thomas penfield jackson said legal 
counsel should be appointed for stays and that prosecutors could 
question the security officer about the alleged drug use 
barry attorney r kenneth mundy said prosecutors should not be 
allowed to question stays about alleged drug use but the judge 
overruled mundys objection 
the defense had called stays as its first witness before his 
testimony was interrupted the 29year police veteran contradicted 
minor points in the testimony of two government witnesses 
the witness has used cocaine on an occasion within the statute 
of limitations said retchin after her crossexamination of stays 
and after the jury had been sent out of the courtroom 
the issue of stays alleged cocaine use came up after he 
testified that he knew willie davis government witnesses have 
testified that davis used cocaine with the mayor 
davis a former aide to birmingham ala mayor richard 
arrington has not been called to testify in the case 
after stays told the court he knew davis retchin asked him if 
he had told another security officer that davis provides mr 
barry with cocaine 
me replied stays no 
the jury was then sent out of the courtroom so that retchin and 
mundy could argue about further questioning of stays 
earlier the judge denied the last of the defenses motions for 
acquittal including the one stemming from an fbi sting operation 
in which the mayor was videotaped smoking crack cocaine 
in addition to the charge stemming from the sting jackson let 
stand a conspiracy charge and two cocaine possession charges one 
wednesday he rejected motions for acquittal on the other 10 
charges drug and perjury charges against the mayor 
barrys lawyers had said he was entrapped in the videotaped 
sting operation they also said the government had failed to prove 
there was a single conspiracy involving the mayor and that 
witnesses had failed to substantiate the dates of the two cocaine 
possession charges 
the judge said court rulings did not support barrys position on 
the entrapment question 
jackson also said there were a series of interlocking 
conspiracies with barry at the hub he said the courts give leeway 
to the government by not requiring it in all cases to prove precise 
dates on which crimes were committed 
the prosecution ended its case wednesday with testimony from a 
city police detective that barry made more than 2000 calls on his 
car phone to people who supplied him with drugs 
the detective said the calls were made in a fouryear span 
starting in 1986 
in 4 weeks of testimony 10 prosecution witnesses testified 
that barry snorted cocaine and smoked crack opium and marijuana 
about 200 times from 1983 to this year 
barry has pleaded innocent to the single conspiracy charge 10 
counts of cocaine possession and three felony charges of lying to a 
federal grand jury

the food and drug administration said today it 
is holding up applications for approval of generic drugs tested by 
a pittsburgh lab whose work has been found by the agency to be 
flawed 
pending applications based on the testing of biodecision 
laboratories inc were put on hold while the fda continues its 
review of the results of an inspection of the lab said fda 
spokesman jeff nesbit 
the fdas inspection in which 13 studies conducted by the lab 
on candidate generic drugs were reviewed found that all but two 
violated fda regulations or fell short of accepted laboratory 
practice 
the findings of the inspection conducted last october through 
january were released earlier this week biodecision is one of the 
nations largest independent testing labs 
the studies were to determine whether the candidate generic drug 
worked the same as the patented drug for which it would be sold as 
a substitute a generic drug must be shown to be bioequivalent 
to a namebrand drug before it can win fda approval 
nesbit said seven of the 11 drugs in which biodecisions studies 
were flawed are not currently being sold the remaining four are 
antibiotics for which a broad potency range is acceptable 
nesbit said he did not know how many generic drug applications 
were being held up 
biodecision president robert lecher was quoted in the pittsburgh 
press as saying the laboratory has confirmed the findings of the 11 
tests questioned by the fda 
lecher said the reevaluations were part of the labs efforts to 
work with the fda to correct problems found in the inspection the 
lab has corrected all but one of the deficiencies cited in the 
inspection he said

environmental protection 
increasing numbers of italian women have been joining the police 
forces in recent years but the armed forces have remained closed 
to them elsewhere in europe women have joined the military in 
many countries 
the bill would open up the italian services to women as 
volunteers and offer careers to them as officers and 
noncommissioned officers but would exclude them from combat roles 
the bill must go before the full senate and then to the chamber 
of deputies

sixyearold vanessa moretti left her dying father 
in the car along a busy highway and dashed away for help 
she ran a mile along a guard rail falling and scratching her 
arms on branches desperately seeking aid from scores of 
vacationbound travelers speeding past no one stopped 
the little girls case has startled italians and prompted some 
columnists to speculate about whether their country is losing its 
soul as it accumulates ever greater wealth 
we have begun to show the cold glacial face that even a few 
years ago we reproached other richer countries for having 
columnist sabino acquaviva said in the milanbased daily corriere 
della sera 
the incident last saturday drew particular outrage because it 
occurred along the sun highway near the western coast that 
thousands of italians were traveling for the start of their 
vacations 
several newspapers said vacationers were so intent on reaching 
the beach they ignored a desperate child on the side of the highway 
the weekend of mass exodus of the big departure of the army 
of vacationers opened with a tragedy made even more bitter by an 
incredible cynicism the turinbased la stampa said 
the little girl finally succeeded in stopping a motorist who 
alerted highway police 
but it was too late to save her father 34yearold marco 
moretti who had died of a heart attack while driving his daughter 
to the beach at monte argentario in central italy 
the beautiful country doesnt exist anymore the days of 
spaghetti and guitars of courtesy and sweetness are over 
acquaviva wrote 
because we have inculcated in people the philosophy of 
wellbeing we have created egoists consumers people who 
ultimately are alone and unhappy 
the case reflected the unease felt by some italians over the 
changes in their country as it has become wealthy during eight 
years of uninterrupted economic growth 
italians who lived in poverty just four decades ago have enjoyed 
a consumer boom donning designer clothes buying bigger cars and 
taking exotic vacations in places like indonesia and mauritius 
in real terms italians spent three times as much in 1988 for 
television sets and other recreational equipment as they did in 
1971 according to the government statistics institute istat 
some people have expressed concern that italians have become 
selfish and indifferent to others as they have grown wealthier 
the average citizen ever more frequently lives involved in 
and absorbed by his own problems interests and affairs immersed 
almost exclusively in his own world the respected romebased 
thinktank censis said in a report released last december

a federal grand jury subpoenaed campaign 
records for all 124 state representatives in connection with an fbi 
sting in which lawmakers were allegedly offered cash for votes 
according to legislators and media reports today 
a lobbyist allegedly paid cash to about 30 lawmakers in exchange 
for votes on an unidentified issue the greenville news and wbtwtv 
in florence reported citing unidentified sources 
an attorney who said he was approached by several lawmakers 
because of the probe said in the alleged sting operation a fake 
lobbyist offered money to lawmakers in exchange for legislative 
favors the attorney requested anonymity 
the house ethics committee received the subpoena wednesday for 
the financial disclosure forms for all house members going back to 
1988 said the committees chairman rep pat harris 
us attorney bart daniel refused to comment on the subpoenas 
we can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any federal 
grand jury investigation daniel said wednesday night 
several lawmakers including one senator said they were 
individually served subpoenas many said they were surprised and 
puzzled by the order 
house speaker bob sheheen said that two house members told him 
fbi agents that visited the lawmakers wanted to know if cash 
contributions were made to their campaigns 
they wanted to know whether those contributions were deposited 
in their camapaign accounts sheheen said 
the investigation apparently involves possible violations of the 
hobbs act a federal anticorruption law that prohibits 
legislators acceptance of money or gifts in return for promised 
performance said an attorney who spoke on conditin of anonymity

federal railroad officials are predicting a 
new era in ground transportation where trains that zip over a 
magnetic field at 300 mph can compete with air travel 
at least two magnetic levitation trains or maglevs will be 
running in the united states before the end of the 1990s federal 
railroad administrator gilbert e carmichael predicted his agency 
this week released a report on the technology 
in addition carmichael said two or three highspeed rail 
steelonsteel systems could be built 
the report said magnetically levitated trains that float along 
at threeeighths of an inch or more from a magnetized rail are 
feasible for the united states even without significant federal 
funding 
with planning for such systems moving ahead in california 
nevada florida texas and pennsylvania carmichael said it is 
still possible for the us to take the lead in a technology on 
which the germans and japanese already have each spent 1 billion 
to develop 
the german and japanese systems operate differently than that 
proposed for the us with the japanese train riding several 
inches above a stronger magnetic field 
the fiscal 1992 federal budget so far includes 12 million to 
study highspeed trains 
congress failed to act last year on a senate committee study 
that recommended 750 million over six years to develop a us 
maglev technology 
but there are signs of growing private interest in magnetic 
trains 
on monday a partnership headed by bechtel international inc 
of san francisco put up 500000 for the right to bid on a 5 
billion maglev train between southern california and las vegas 
planners hope to have the train running in seven years 
business and government leaders in pittsburgh are moving to 
make the city a technological and manufacturing base for the 
germandeveloped system while developing a 19mile demonstration 
run between downtown pittsburgh and the citys airport 
a privately funded project in florida is planning to build a 
14mile german system by 1994 to link orlando airport to disney 
world and other nearby resorts 
at least two companies are bidding to develop a highspeed 
rail system in texas to link houston and dallas 
magnetic trains do not yet carries paying passengers anywhere in 
the world but the carmichael described a recent ride on a 19mile 
test system in west germany 
you feel it levitate and then you feel it swoosh you along 
without any vibration carmichael said cows were grazing 
underneath when we passed over and they didnt even look up 
because the trains float on a powerful magnetic field there is 
no friction or wear and far less energy is consumed it takes about 
as much electricity to run the german system as to aircondition it 
carmichael said and the only pollution comes from producing the 
electricity 
usual fares would be about 20 percent below air fares and 40 
percent lower on some shorter routes carmichael said in some 
cases trips between major city centers would be faster than by 
plane since downtown stations would be used 
the report said the united states started and then abandoned the 
maglev technology two decades ago and now faces the prospect of 
buying guideways and trains from west germany or japan 
maglev technologies are in competition with highspeed rail 
which is a fast train that runs on special tracks and with swedish 
tilting trains that allow faster service on existing tracks without 
passengers feeling the curves 
the maglev system is expensive about 30 million a mile on 
routes that could carry trains simultaneously in both directions 
but the fra report said costs could be offset by savings in highway 
and airport construction pollution control reduced travel delays 
and in the increased commerce the system would attract

the captain of united flight 232 said 
today his reunion with the survivors of the cartwheeling crash has 
been very emotional and he reluctantly accepts being called a hero 
more than 100 of the 184 survivors were attending a daylong 
reunion one year after the july 19 1989 crash that killed 112 
people several relatives of the dead were expected at an afternoon 
prayer service 
to be able to talk it out and to talk it through with them 
its been very fulfilling united air lines capt al c haynes 
said at a news conference 
haynes said there were no heroes among the crew that guided the 
crippled dc10 jetliner to the sioux gateway airport but he said 
some people needed to look up to the crew as part of their healing 
if we are serving some kind of function by being called 
heroes so be it haynes said id like to think that any other 
welltrained crew would have responded as we did 
several passengers arriving late wednesday sought out haynes 
who managed to fly the plane after its flight controls were severed 
by an engine explosion the jumbo jet cartwheeled in flames on 
landing at sioux gateway airport 
haynes said today he would not ever get over the crash but 
im well through it im well on to other things 
i think about it every day but ive never had nightmares 
haynes said i dont dwell on it 
several survivors and relatives of the victims visited the 
airport wednesday some left flowers at the perimeter 
some survivors attending the reunion flew for the first time 
since the tragedy 
you could feel the plane heat up with emotion as we came in 
for a landing said becky larson who flew with crash survivors 
on a united air lines flight from denver late wednesday 
a lot of people said they hadnt flown since the crash and 
some of them wouldnt look out the window but i did i wanted to 
see it from the air said ms larson a united flight attendant 
who saw the crash from the ground and was among the first rescuers 
on the scene 
survivor mark michaelson of cincinnati said flying isnt routine 
anymore 
takeoffs are difficult landings are difficult turbulence is 
especially difficult he said every once in a while when you 
are in the clouds for an extended period of time and cant see 
where you are going you get anxiety attacks 
michaelson survived the crash with his wife lori and their 
daughter sabrina mrs michaelson since has campaigned for 
mandatory child safety seats on commercial flights sabrina then 
1 was thrown from her mothers arms in the crash 
passengers and their families have been arriving all week for 
the anniversary said linda phillips who is coordinating the event 
for the local chamber of commerce 
phillips estimated 160 passengers and their families and a few 
relatives of those killed planned to join the reunion at their own 
expense 
phillips said sioux city residents are proud of their rescue 
efforts but that the reunion was not designed as a pat on the back 
for the home crowd 
were doing it because we feel it needs to be done she 
said they were coming back here at the anniversary whether we 
did anything or not 
emergency personnel had practiced responding to a nearly 
identical calamity two years before the crash after the crash 
residents offered food transportation and even their homes to the 
survivors and hundreds lined up to give blood without anyone 
putting out a call to do so 
there are no heroes said shirley brown assistant city 
manager the people genuinely believe that they just did their 
jobs that day they did them well they were coordinated and they 
had rehearsed but they simply did what they had practiced

high schoolers who beam sexually charged 
stares at classmates or exchange snippets of intimate gossip could 
fall afoul of new guidelines to curb sexual harassment among 
students 
the rules are designed to make school a more comfortable place 
the principal said thursday 
we had an idea that we should have a clear statement in our 
student handbook about sexual harassment said ilene levitt 
principal of the amherstpelham regional high school 
i think in 1970 people would have turned up their eyebrows 
this is 1990 and i think students understand 
jason bray incoming senior class vice president said some may 
laugh at the handbooks detailed offenses but he thinks it was a 
good idea 
sexual harassment at the high school generally takes the form of 
little things said bray 17 but hearty flirting by a macho 
man can be upsetting he said especially to girls that arent 
popular and dont know these people im sure it made them very 
uneasy 
another incoming senior 17yearold jennifer emery said she 
was surprised about the policy because she had never considered 
sexual harassment a problem at the school 
plenty of people have given me strange looks and said strange 
things to me but its all been a joke she said 
at the national association of secondary school principals 
spokeswoman maryellen parker said she had not heard of a high 
school having a similar policy but it is an issue the association 
has promoted for some time 
sexual harassment is a widespread problem but it receives 
little attention from administrators or teachers so its good to 
see that there are policies that are beginning to occur its long 
overdue parker said in a telephone interview from reston va 
the policy which has been approved in principle by school 
officials lists several behaviors that would qualify as sexual 
harassment among them staring or leering with sexual overtones 
spreading sexual gossip making unwanted sexual comments exerting 
pressure for sexual activity and making unwanted physical contact 
of a sexual nature 
the guidelines will be printed in student handbooks this fall 
pending a few changes in language that do not affect the substance 
of the draft said school committee chairwoman joan hanson 
its something that several people have felt for a long 
time hanson said times have changed 
while the focus is on students the guidelines also point out 
that sexual advances from adults at the school are not appropriate 
possible punishment includes a parent conference apology to the 
victim detention suspension expulsion and in cases of physical 
assault referral to police levitt said 
the school probably will rely most heavily on the first two 
avenues she said 
levitt said it may be hard to make a determination on reports of 
leers and gossip but at the very least there will have been 
discussion of the problem 
we have a sense of humor too she said theres certainly 
sexual behavior thats appropriate among adolescents we certainly 
arent puritans

two congressional proposals introduced 
thursday call for the united states to stop all aid to kenya until 
the african nation frees political prisoners and implements 
democratic freedoms 
americans should not send these tax dollars to a government 
that denies its citizens their basic rights said sen edward m 
kennedy dmass who authored senate legislation 
a companion measure was introduced in the house of 
representatives by tom lantos a california democrat 
neither chamber is expected to act before september after a 
summer recess 
congressional democrats have criticized kenyan president daniel 
arap moi but the decision to propose the aid cut follows rioting 
that began july 7 after police using clubs and tear gas dispersed a 
crowd attempting to hold a prodemocracy rally in nairobi 
twenty eight people were killed in the four days of disturbance 
and seven democracy advocates including two former government 
officials were detained without trial 
amnesty international said thursday that it had learned of the 
arrest of eight additional government critics since then the 
londonbased human rights organization warned about the alarming 
deterioration of the rule of law in kenya and the harsh 
conditions under which political prisoners are held 
kenya is the largest recipient of us aid to subsaharan 
africa this year it was scheduled to receive 46 million 
including 11 million in military assistance for next year the 
bush administration has asked congress to give kenya 42 million 
16 million of which is for the military 
but sen paul simon dill chairman of the senate subcommittee 
on africa said he had frozen some 13 million of this years aid 
he said kenyas president daniel arap moi was heavily dependent 
on foreign aid and loans which comprise 27 percent of his 
governments annual budget 
the only language he moi understands is that of aid said 
gibson kuria a prominent dissident who sought refuge last month in 
the us embassy in nairobi and was allowed to leave the country 
kuria said moi was in a panic because of growing pressure to 
legalize political parties 
a letter from coretta scott king jesse jackson and other 
prominent blacks made public during the news conference calls on 
the administration to cut all aid to mois government 
kenya has been a us favorite in africa for many years 
eschewing socialism even when its neighbors embraced it and 
providing a stable buffer against soviet influence in east africa 
moi contends multiparty democracy is unsuitable for kenya and 
other african countries because it could lead to tribal wars kenya 
did have opposition parties after it gained independence in 1963 
and until moi who took power in 1978 amended the constitution in 
1982

khmer rouge guerrillas have 
seized large areas deep inside cambodia in recent months and say 
they will fight as long as needed if they are shut out of a 
political settlement 
a recent fiveweek 450mile trip through the countrys north by 
this reporter found the khmer rouge have strong chinese support and 
have stockpiled caches of weapons ammunition and funds in case 
foreign aid is cut 
the united states announced wednesday it was withdrawing 
recognition of the guerrilla coalition dominated by the communist 
khmer rouge the coalition also includes the noncommunist forces 
of prince norodom sihanouk and son sann 
the us move was prompted by fears of a return to power of the 
khmer rouge the communist group killed hundreds of thousands of 
people in forced agrarian reform in the 1970s until vietnam invaded 
and installed a new government in early 1979 
the 30000man khmer rouge army already controls hundreds of 
villages in the countrys south west and north and it operates in 
virtually all parts of the country 
in their jungle command posts senior khmer rouge commanders 
said recently they were stepping up the fight to force the 
vietnamesebacked government into political concessions 
the khmer rouge have everything they want from china they 
dont need any more guns or money said col khan savoeun a 
commander of sihanouks army 
us support for the noncommunists is very important 
psychologically for the noncommunist resistance but it means 
nothing for the khmer rouge 
ta pok a khmer rouge brigade commander in this northwestern 
province said he listened to the voice of america and radio free 
asia for news on peace and hoped for progress but he said the 
guerrillas cannot wait around for documents to be signed 
the vietnamese will only listen to strength and if they dont 
listen they will lose everything ta pok said our strategy is 
to isolate kompong speu battambang and kompong thom but we 
already have most of kompong speu and kompong thom we are doing 
very very well 
the guerrillas have seized large quantities of weapons in recent 
fighting dozens of hidden jungle bases are full of ammunition and 
captured heavy weapons were seen in the north 
the chinese aid is channeled through the thai border but as the 
guerrillas push deeper into the country they rely on the hidden 
caches and food from recently seized villages 
thousands of soldiers and civilian supporters were seen moving 
freely through newly seized areas 
heavy fighting between khmer rouge and government troops holed 
up at several key forward outposts defending siem riep city was 
heard every day the guerrillas mined roads attacked supply 
convoys and overran government artillery bases 
we are winning more easily than we expected there is nothing 
that can stop us said khmer rouge division commander mit lot in 
charge of areas around the ancient temples of angkor wat in siem 
reap province 
if cambodian prime minister hun sen is not flexible we will 
fight and for sure we will win he said 
the guerrillas appear to have substantial popular support many 
villagers say the khmer rouge are not forcing them to fight and 
pay those who help carry ammunition and supplies the guerrillas 
also pay a high price for rice 
however some villagers said they were afraid to refuse 
guerrilla requests for help 
as part of preparations in case foreign aid is cut the khmer 
rouge have seized large gemmining areas in the south and collect 
more than half a million dollars monthly in taxes from miners said 
western intelligence analysts in bangkok 
in the north they have created a sophisticated logging 
operation and trucks full of teakwood head toward markets in 
thailand daily from vast forests under their control 
the guerrillas now have a network of thousands of miles of roads 
snaking from areas under their control to new front lines deep in 
the interior dozens of chinesesupplied trucks and jeeps were seen 
ferrying ammunition to the guerrillas attacking positions around 
siem riep and angkor wat 
bulldozers were clearing new paths in the jungles 
a year ago we used porters to take supplies to the 
frontlines said khmer rouge commander ta pok now we have 
trucks which can go anywhere 
som narin a sihanouk army commander said the khmer rouge had 
such firm control over the area near angkor wat they didnt even 
need to carry guns this is now khmer rouge cambodia he said 
tens of thousands of civilians who have lived in isolated jungle 
camps run by the khmer rouge along the thai border since 1979 have 
moved to newly seized towns and villages in cambodia 
but while analysts agree the khmer rouge army is superior to the 
government and the other guerrilla groups there are signs they 
have difficulties gaining wider support as they move from jungle 
outposts to more populated areas 
in many areas villagers did not readily offer food and 
information although they did not do anything to oppose the khmer 
rouge

when karen yee wanted to tell her 
uncles she was safe after a devastating earthquake she turned to 
the local radio station in baguio to get the message through 
when red cross official richard gordon needed to confer with 
authorities in quakedamaged cabanatuan he did so in a telephone 
patch provided by another radio station which aired the 
consultations live 
in the aftermath of mondays earthquake which left about 500 
people dead radio and television stations not only reported the 
news 
they helped rescuers and worried relatives circumvent poor 
communications and served as a spur to a clumsy unresponsive 
bureaucracy 
broadcasters directed rescuers to areas of destruction relayed 
messages to family members separated by the disaster and solicited 
relief goods 
it was the radio stations which were coordinating rescue 
efforts broacasting the need for blood blankets medicines 
earthmoving equipment columnist luis beltran wrote in the 
manila standard government departments went to them for guidance 
on what to send where to send 
after the quake struck provincial affiliates of the major 
networks broadcast the first reports of destruction at that time 
president corazon aquinos staff said only that it was studying 
the extent of the disaster 
provincial officials unable to get through to manila by 
telephone broadcast appeals to the capital for assistance over 
private stations 
radio and television reporters traveled through the affected 
area and briefed government officials about which towns and cities 
were in urgent need of help 
they served as effective alternatives to government agencies 
whose addiction to routine has robbed them of the power of 
initiative and the ability to respond quickly former labor 
minister blas ople wrote in the manila bulletin 
as the extent of the disaster became clearer managements of 
stations dzrh dzmm dzbb dzxl and others discontinued regular 
programming for roundtheclock quake coverage 
we shifted to publicservice priority programming because we 
feel that that is the need of the present time said maria 
asuncion lanuza program coordinator of dzbb i think we are 
complementing the government 
faced with severe communications problems government officials 
turned to radio stations as an effective means of relaying 
instructions 
late monday gordon the red cross official who also serves as 
mayor of olongapo telephoned dzmm and asked the station to report 
that he and a us rescue team were heading to cabanatuan to help 
search for students trapped in a school building 
while gordon was on the telephone the station patched his call 
through to the cabanatuan mayor in a conversation broadcast live 
the two discussed what equipment and supplies were needed 
the quake also isolated baguio a mountain resort 110 miles 
north of manila by cutting off telephone service damaging the 
airport and triggering landslides that closed all roads 
ordinary people turned to the radio to relay messages to their 
loved ones in baguio radio stations set up an outdoor office 
along the main street where people could tape brief messages that 
were broadcast nationwide by affiliate stations 
relatives in manila in turn aired appeals to family members in 
quakeaffected areas 
in one message miss yee said from baguio that she and her 
mother were safe but daddy hasnt come yet the message was 
directed primarily at her fathers brothers in pampanga province 
in manila a weeping linda pineda made an appeal over dzrh to 
her three children studying in baguio 
if you are safe my children please go to reporters and tell 
them you are fine she sobbed 
i dont know where you are children she added but it 
would reassure me if you send word through reporters

the justice department was unable to pursue a 
fraud claim against the maker of the b2 bomber because the 
government had known northrop corps cost system was essentially 
a farce according to a document 
rep john dingell dmich on wednesday disclosed portions of a 
september 1988 justice department memorandum that found northrop 
submitted false cost and scheduling data to the air force on the 
b2 program the disclosure came in a letter to defense secretary 
dick cheney 
while certain of the allegations concerning program 
deficiencies are essentially accurate the air force has known of 
these facts for some time but has chosen to take no remedial 
action the memo said so there is no fraud case to be made 
officials of the air force defense department and northrop 
corp said they were aware of dingells letter but had no 
immediate comment 
the government has invested more than 25 billion to build the 
radarevading aircraft scrutiny of aircraft production however 
has been limited because the program was classified until last year 
the justice department said in the memo that the defense 
contract audit agency had only two auditors assigned to northrop to 
oversee the operation during that time it said the companys 
cost schedule control system which measures potential cost 
overruns and schedule delays produced false information 
northrops cost schedule control system is essentially a 
farce the memo said 
dingell chairman of the house energy and commerce subcommittee 
on oversight and investigations asked cheney to assemble an 
independent court of inquiry that would report to congress by 
aug 24 
it is clear that in the air forces zeal to protect the 
funding for the b2 program they have ignored or tolerated major 
infractions by northrop to the detriment of the taxpayers 
dingell said in the letter to cheney 
faced with a diminished soviet threat and an increasing budget 
deficit cheney in april cut the production number of the 
batwinged aircraft from 132 to 75 but congressional opposition to 
the plane remains with lawmakers highly critical of the cost of 
860 million per plane 
the senate armed services committee approving a 289 billion 
defense bill last week agreed to cheneys request for two planes 
in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 at a cost of nearly 5 billion 
for the aircraft and other expenses 
amendments to kill the program are expected when the full senate 
takes up the bill 
the house armed services committee begins crafting its version 
of the defense bill later this month and attempts to terminate the 
b2 program in the full house remain strong

calling parole and prison officials 
bleeding hearts a judge has thrown the book at a drug 
trafficker caught dealing in cocaine after serving only a portion 
of a previous sentence 
some idiot in the prison system thought you were rehabilitated 
after three years us district judge g kendall sharp declared 
in ordering robert zingarell back to prison 
zingarell 49 had appeared before the judge in 1984 after being 
convicted of selling 400 pounds of marijuana and 22 pounds of 
cocaine sharp imposed what he thought was a harsh sentence 10 
years 
zingarell was back in court wednesday and the judge took the 
occasion to blast the us parole commission and the us bureau of 
prisons on the way they choose to release drug dealers 
he then lambasted zingarell who served 3 years in prison 
before being paroled he gave zingarell another 10 years in prison 
despite a guilty plea and his cooperation with prosecutors 
if they had put him away like i did the first time he 
wouldnt have been out dealing cocaine again sharp told a 
reporter later 
they are a bunch of bleeding hearts making room for new 
inmates by cutting other people loose i understand their problem 
but it undermines my ability to give what is an appropriate 
sentence 
they ought to ship them to an isolated island in the pacific 
and if they want to escape let them try 
assistant us attorney cynthia hawkins told sharp of 
zingarells cooperation in an investigation against some 
codefendants federal guidelines called for zingarell to face up 
to eight years in prison ms hawkins recommended he receive no 
more than 6 years but sharp departed from the guidelines and 
recommendation in his 10year sentence 
zingarells attorney mark omara said sharp improperly 
enhanced both the seriousness of his clients crime and the range 
of the sentence 
i dont think he did it right and i know mr zingarell will 
appeal omara said

fallen baseball hero pete rose was sentenced 
today to five months in prison and fined 50000 for cheating on 
his taxes 
i have no excuses because its all my fault the former 
manager of the cincinnati reds baseball team said i lost my 
dignity i lost my self respect and i almost lost a lot of dear 
friends 
rose was sentenced for failing to report more than 354000 in 
income from baseball memorabilia sales autograph appearances and 
the gambling for which he was banned from professional baseball 
us district judge s arthur spiegel also ordered rose to spend 
three months in a halfway house after the prison term and perform 
1000 hours of community service with innercity youths he could 
have sentenced rose to six years in prison and a 500000 fine 
spiegel repeatedly referred to roses standing as a baseball 
hero but said he had to ignore roses fame in considering 
punishment 
today we are not dealing with the legend he said 
the 49yearold rose blames his troubles on a gambling disorder 
for which hes getting treatment he first denied having a gambling 
problem when friends told investigators he bet on cincinnati reds 
games while managing the team 
he still denies betting on baseball but accepted a lifetime ban 
from the sport last august he is eligible next month to apply for 
reinstatement to baseball but has indicated he will not do so 
rose limping from a knee injury showed no visible reaction 
when he was sentenced but earlier roses voice broke as he told 
the judge he was sorry 
your honor id like to say im very sorry very shameful to 
be here today in front of you rose said 
his voice faltered again when he told the judge how his 
5yearold son had told his wife that his daddy is a jailbird 
spiegel allowed rose to remain free until aug 10 so that he 
may have surgery on his injured knee then he is expected to report 
to a federal prison in ashland ky 
spiegel praised roses accomplishments on the baseball field 
but said he had to impose a jail sentence out of fairness 
foremost we must recognize that there are two people here 
pete rose the living legend the alltime hit leader and the idol 
of millions and pete rose the individual who appears today 
convicted of two counts of cheating on his taxes spiegel said 
today we are not dealing with the legend 
roses tax problems began to surface when baseball investigator 
john dowd started looking into his betting habits in early 1989 a 
federal grand jury was convened in cincinnati to see whether rose 
reported all of his income 
rose agreed to plead guilty april 20 to two counts of failing to 
report income federal prosecutors agreed not to pursue further 
charges 
rose admitted he hid 354968 in income from 1984 to 1987 he 
has repaid the internal revenue service 366042 as part of the 
plea agreement 
two of roses reputed gambling associates former roommate 
thomas gioiosa and bookmaker ronald peters were sentenced last 
year on drug and tax charges 
peters received a twoyear term for tax evasion and cocaine 
distribution peters claimed he accepted roses bets including 
bets on reds games rose admitted gioiosa placed his bets with 
bookmakers 
gioiosa was sentenced to a fiveyear term for transporting 
cocaine and five months on two tax counts

mikhail s gorbachevs 79yearold mother only 
recently got a new color television to replace her old 
blackandwhite set still bakes her own bread and complains her 
son never visits 
in an unusually revealing story about the family of a soviet 
leader the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda reported thursday that 
the only privilege given to maria pantelyevna gorbachev are the kgb 
agents who provide security down the road from her small house in 
the southern russian village of privolnoye 
the kgb is there not so much to guard her from the many 
journalists who find their way to the farming village where 
gorbachev was born but to keep ordinary citizens from pestering 
her with petitions for her son the newspaper said 
until recently the private lives of communist party leaders and 
their families rarely appeared in the staterun media but under 
gorbachevs policy of greater openness or glasnost many 
restrictions have been lifted although the western media have 
reported on gorbachevs roots and his family such things are new 
to soviet readers 
thursdays frontpage article titled home of the president 
was complete with an old photograph of a young plump gorbachev 
reclining in a field wearing a jaunty beret 
gorbachevs widowed mother the newspaper said still does the 
chores around the house and bakes her own bread even though a 
collective farm bakery was built several years ago to feed the 
villages 3000 people 
a new paint job on her house and the color tv that recently 
replaced the old rekord model blackandwhite set have not 
cost the state or the party one kopeck wrote komsomolskaya 
pravda correspondent o shapovalov 
not long ago a rumor spread that mrs gorbachev was moving to 
moscow and selling her house the newspaper said 
residents of privolnoye were ready to make inquiries about 
buying her house but she told nikolai dorokhov her neighbor and 
secretary of the party organization of the collective farm 
i have already lived in moscow i dont see my son here and i 
wouldnt see him there he leaves home at 6 am and returns late 
in the evening i will not go anywhere 
gorbachev last visited his birthplace 3 years ago the 
newspaper reported and while he was there spent only 40 minutes 
inside his house and another 40 minutes talking to villagers 
earlier this week he met with west german chancellor helmut 
kohl in nearby stavropol where he began his communist party work 
in 1955 but he apparently didnt visit his mother in privolnoye 
alla georgievna zavalikhina ideology secretary of the party 
committee in nearby krasnogvardeisky usually accompanies 
journalists who visit privolnoye and complained to the newspaper 
about the manners of soviet reporters 
foreign correspondents are more tactful at least no one who 
was warned beforehand tried to get into her house mrs 
zavalikhina said 
its more difficult to explain to ours one soviet tv crew 
wanted to interview her for a popular show by any means she 
added 
isnt it clear that it isnt decent to bother an elderly 
woman even if this woman is not the presidents mother 
the newspaper reported that although there is a small gorbachev 
display at the party offices in stavropol privolnoye has no 
museums or plaques to mark its historic significance by 
presidential request 
all this is to the chagrin of venyamin a lutsenko director of 
a small party museum in in krasnogvardeisky 12 miles away he told 
the newspaper hed really like to have the pen that gorbachev and 
former president reagan used in 1987 to sign the treaty to destroy 
mediumrange nuclear weapons 
thus the only monument in privolnoye is the roadblock manned by 
the kgb agents who according to the newspaper tell citizens 
trying to pass along their petitions to use the mailbox

media reports from hong kong and washington that 
ousted communist party leader zhao ziyang is being rehabilitated 
drew flustered claims of ignorance thursday from a foreign ministry 
spokesman 
i havent seen such a report jin guihua said at the 
ministrys weekly news conference i advise you not to believe 
this kind of rumors too easily 
after the news conference worried he might be misunderstood 
the normally unflappable jin told reporters in flustered english 
i must say that the conditions of zhao ziyang i dont know i 
dont know his present status i dont know so dont misquote me 
what i want to advise you there are so many rumors the 
honest advice i give you is not to believe there are too many 
rumors rumors are rampant be careful thats all 
jin refused to deny the reports outright however the official 
xinhua news agency later quoted an unidentified foreign ministry 
official as saying the reports were a groundless rumor and that 
zhao was still being investigated jin made no such statement at 
the news conference 
the hong kongbased south china morning post on tuesday quoted 
an unidentified us official as saying senior leader deng xiaoping 
was planning to send zhao on an inspection mission throughout 
china the paper said the information came from members of a 
delegation of chinese mayors touring us cities 
the los angeles times quoted an unidentified us official in 
washington as saying that zhao already was making an inspection 
trip 
giving zhao such an assignment would be tantamount to 
rehabilitating him and would signal a reassessment at the highest 
party levels of the handling of last years studentled 
demonstrations for democracy 
that in turn would reflect a major realignment of forces at the 
top of the party one year after ideological hardliners prevailed 
with their position that pressure for democratic reform must be 
quashed at all costs 
zhao was ousted last year as party general secretary for 
allegedly supporting the demonstrations and opposing the army 
attack that crushed them the party central committee accused him 
of splitting the party a serious offense and official media 
reports accused his aides of plotting a virtual coup on his behalf 
officials say his case is still under investigation indicating 
he has powerful supporters one is believed to be deng himself who 
brought zhao to beijing in 1980 to help carry out his marketstyle 
economic reforms 
zhao was an enthusiastic economic reformer but was not an 
advocate of sweeping political changes shortly before his ouster 
however he visited the demonstrating students in tiananmen square 
and expressed sympathy for them 
there have been subtle signals recently of political jostling 
behind the scenes analyzing the signals has become a preoccupation 
among beijing intellectuals many believe the signals reflect 
growing strength in the reformist camp 
zhao meanwhile is widely believed to be living at in a small 
walled compound in central beijing 
also thursday the beijing economics institute confirmed 
unofficial reports that fugitive student leader zhai weimin had 
been arrested and jailed a university official contacted by 
telephone said she had no details and did not give her name 
zhai 22 is the fourth beijing student known to have been 
arrested without publicity in the past three months even as the 
government tries to ease foreign criticism by announcing large 
prisoner releases 
the other three were students at beijing university suspected of 
involvement in underground activities 
in february zhai held a secret conference in beijing of his 
underground reform group the democratic front for the salvation of 
china participants in the conference told foreign journalists at 
the time that more than 60 people took part

a proposal to sell the organs of dead welfare 
recipients has prompted such outrage that some people fear it will 
undermine other plans to solve a serious organ donor crisis 
milwaukee county board supervisor t anthony zielinski made the 
proposal in an effort to reduce the countys burial expenses but a 
flood of criticism persuaded him to drop the plan and it now has 
no chance of passage 
still some observers are worried that the political backlash 
from zielinskis plan will doom other proposals to help relieve 
donor organ shortages 
one such proposal would have allowed welfare recipients to sign 
forms permitting the county to donate their organs after death 
that plan is now likely to be scuttled according to jeff aiken a 
spokesman for the milwaukee county social services department 
there is a desperate need for organs this was one way to make 
welfare recipients aware of the need for organ transplant aikin 
said 
zielinski had proposed selling the organs whether or not the 
welfare recipients had granted permission 
if they cant help society while theyre alive maybe they can 
help it while theyre dead he said after introducing the 
proposal in may 
he said the organs could be sold to hospitals or organ donor 
networks although it is not clear whether they would be willing to 
purchase the organs all organs now are donated 
critics including colleagues of zielinski and advocates for the 
poor said his plan would rob the poor of dignity even in death 
i dont think we ought to start selling poor peoples organs 
just because they died on welfare supervisor elizabeth 
coggsjones said 
zielinski 29 dropped the idea after initial criticism then he 
renewed anger a short time later when he suggested wisconsin 
legalize donor organ sales which now violate the state 
constitution 
he also proposed that the county cremate rather than bury dead 
welfare recipients to save money 
he has since apologized for both plans and changed his position 
he also said he doesnt support the proposal to ask welfare 
recipients if they would like to become organ donors 
im opposed to asking welfare recipients that question im 
opposed to cremating them if they dont state a choice they should 
be buried it should be the preference of the individual whatever 
they want zielinski said 
elizabeth bolt organ procurement director for milwaukees 
froedtert memorial hospital said despite the serious need for more 
donor organs she understood why zielinskis proposals met 
opposition 
theres a very strong feeling that this should be voluntary 
we talk about the gift of life the gift of organ donations ms 
bolt said wednesday 
like aiken she said she believed the response to zielinskis 
proposals could doom other efforts to encourage organ donations by 
welfare recipients

five cubans who entered the residence of a 
czechoslovak diplomat in havana to seek asylum left the building 
today wearing masks and were taken away in a cuban police vehicle 
a news agency reported 
the brief report from havana by mexicos official news agency 
notimex quoted unidentified journalists it did not say whether the 
cubans had acted voluntarily or explain why they were wearing the 
masks 
the four cuban men and one woman took refuge in the residence of 
the charge daffaires jan doemoek last week they were among 
small groups of cuban asylumseekers who began entering embassies 
in havana eight days ago 
their departure came as spain and cuba exchanged barbs over the 
flight of asylumseekers to the spanish embassy in havana madrid 
recalled its ambassador after cuban police seized one of the 
refugees sent more guards to the compound and suspended 25 
million in grants to cuba 
the european commissioner for latin american relations abel 
matutes of spain said through a spokesman today in brussels that 
three symbolic aid projects about to be undertaken by the ec 
with cuba would not go ahead 
at least 13 cubans have reportedly holed up in embassies or 
residences of spain czechoslovakia and italy 
the embassy standoffs have drawn wide publicity because similar 
situations in east german embassies last year helped precipitate 
the fall of that nations hardline communist government albania 
which like cuba has refused to adopt westernstyle reforms also 
recently allowed hundreds of people who occupied embassies in its 
capital tirana to leave for new lives in the west 
state radio and television in cuba today gave extensive coverage 
to the trial of 11 human rights activists who were convicted in 
havana of crimes against the state the official cuban news agency 
prensa latina said 
the coverage featured the prosecutor accusing us officials in 
havana of instigating the activists the dispatch from havana 
said 
prosecutor sara nieves said officials at the us interests 
section had provided logistical support and orientation to the 
members of prohuman rights youth who were convicted on wednesday 
according to prensa latina she said the united states was using 
the group to foment economic chaos and carry out terrorist acts 
the activists were given sentences ranging from 15 years in 
prison to three years of house arrest for counterrevolutionary 
crimes such as terrorism and rebellion 
the dispatch said the defendants had planned to steal explosives 
to blow up the national library and the cuban institute of radio 
and television 
nieves also accused the defendants of contact with other western 
diplomatic missions and with venezuelan diplomats prensa latina 
said 
the dispatch monitored in mexico city said nieves described 
prohuman rights youth as the armed wing of the outlawed prohuman 
rights party 
spain said it has recalled ambassador antonio serrano de haro 
for consultations it accused cuba of words removed from the 
customary niceties of international coexistence 
the tensions broke into the open earlier in the day when spains 
foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez suggested to 
reporters that leader fidel castro knew his regime would crumble if 
he opened the door to all cubans who want to leave cuba a former 
spanish colony has 11 million residents 
the situation in havana is very nervous due to cubas 
isolation from the world and because of the extremely serious 
economic problems there fernandez ordonez told spanish national 
radio no one wants a catastrophe there what is needed is a 
peaceful transition to democracy 
cuba retaliated later in the day issuing its own statement 
saying spain had violated cuban and international law by harboring 
asylumseekers it said in a statement that it would never yield to 
pressure or blackmail by people seeking to leave the caribbean 
island prensa latina reported 
the cuban statement also accused spains foreign minister of 
suffering from an attack of historical amnesia displaying a 
scandalous lack of education about international law and being 
morally disqualified from commenting on cuban human rights 
cuba was a spanish colony from the 16th century to 1898 
castros government has portrayed the asylumseekers as 
antisocial elements 
also wednesday madrid sent a special security squad to havana 
cubas capital to reinforce security at the spanish embassy 
cuban police entered the grounds of the spanish embassy on 
friday in pursuit of a young cuban asylumseeker and arrested him 
three other cubans were reportedly inside the embassy and a fourth 
arrived wednesday according to the spanish news agency efe 
on tuesday cuban police arrested a man in the us diplomatic 
post in havana both spain and the united states protested the 
incidents 
the cuban refugee crisis has attracted attention in part because 
it is reminiscent of the east german refugees who sought passage to 
the west at embassies in eastern europe last year their exodus 
helped precipitate the fall of east germanys rigid communist 
government 
albania which like cuba has refused to adopt democratic 
reforms just last week allowed hundreds of people who had entered 
embassies in its capital to leave for new lives in the west

three republican presidents who 
followed richard nixon into office today praised him as a man who 
made the world a safer place 
thousands turned out on a sweltering day for the dedication of 
nixons presidential libary and hear speeches from president bush 
and former presidents ronald reagan and gerald ford 
nixon was the nations 37th president and only one to resign 
from office 
nothing we have ever seen matches this moment to be welcomed 
home so warmly on this day nixon said on behalf of himself and 
his wife pat 
bush paid tribute to nixon as a true architect of peace 
fords and reagans speeches were laced with humor and fond 
remembrances 
you dick nixon have the gratitude of men and women 
everywhere who cherish peace with liberty said ford 
i do not think it is an exaggeration to say that the world is 
a better place a safer place because of richard nixon reagan 
said 
in a glowing tribute bush said richard nixon was the 
quintessence of middle america a leader who presided over the 
nation during times perhaps as tumultuous as any since 
lincolns 
richard nixon helped change the course not only of america but 
of the entire world said bush he said nixons pathbreaking 
trip to china in 1972 revolutionized the world and recalled 
that it was nixon who signed the first agreement with the soviets 
to limit strategic nuclear arms 
among those at the dedication were former secretary of state 
henry kissinger and other nixon administration officials and 
nixons daughters julie nixon eisenhower and tricia nixon and 
their husbands 
tourists also turned out for the event wearing sandals shorts 
and carrying beach chairs thousands waited outside the nixon 
library at dawn paying 15 to park and shelling out another 15 
for presidential tshirts 
police said 15000 people were at the gates when they opened 
after dawn its a very historic event especially with four 
presidents here said margaret gavras 29 of huntington beach 
who arrived wednesday night and parked her motor home at a church 
jimmy carter was the only living former president and the only 
democrat among them not attending the opening he had a previous 
commitment said carrie harmon spokeswoman for the carter 
presidential center in atlanta she would not elaborate 
nixon and his wife visited the 21 million library wednesday for 
the first time and viewed restoration of the house where he was 
born a handful of tourists applauded him and some girl scouts 
handed mrs nixon a bouquet 
as a young boy in yorba linda i never thought of being the 
president of the united states nixon says on a tape recording to 
be played for visitors to the 900squarefoot home my goal was 
to become a railroad engineer 
many of the furnishings in the house were there when he was born 
jan 9 1913 including the bed he was born in and the quilt that 
covered it 
he was 9 when his parents moved to whittier where nixon made 
his first successful run for congress in 1946 library displays 
follow his career from there to the senate in 1950 the vice 
presidency in 1952 and the presidency in 1968 
the watergate scandal culminated in nixons resignation on aug 
9 1974 the resignation also is treated in library displays 
visitors to the library can hear crucial white house tapes of 
conversations nixon had about watergate with administration 
officials recordings that lost nixon the political support he 
needed to survive calls for his impeachment 
if anything the opening of the library and the birthplace 
will draw more attention to watergate because that is what most of 
those who are covering the event for the media are most interested 
in nixon told the los angeles times 
over time as their interest fades and if the public 
continues to visit the museum i would think that all the events 
covered will be seen in a more objective perspective nixon said 
in a written response to the newspapers questions 
on wednesday nixon met with some former officials of his 
administration who gathered for the dedication 
ive never been concerned about his place in history said 
bruce whelihan who worked in the nixon white house press office 
i always knew it would happen it was just a matter of time 
said former speechwriter kenneth khachigian 
san clemente which nixon put on the map as his western white 
house had been the planned site of the library there was even a 
ceremonial groundbreaking but the project got caught in red tape 
nixon eventually withdrew his permission and was delighted when 
yorba linda offered a home 
the library will simply be a museum for a year until papers from 
before and after nixons presidency are brought here and made 
available to scholars 
nixons presidential papers were impounded by congress and are 
in a government warehouse in alexandria va some 15 million of 
the white house documents will be recorded on digital disks for use 
by scholars at the library 
by nixons choice his library will get neither federal money 
nor secret service protection he contributed 2 million to the 
library 
admission is 395 for adults

a plan to provide us support for emerging 
eastern european democracies became tangled in a political dispute 
thursday as senate foreign relations committee democrats approved 
an aid package despite a republican boycott 
the democratcontrolled panel voted 100 with all nine 
republican members absent to send the 535 million bill to the 
full senate the measure would give president bush a long menu of 
ideas for advancing economic reform in the former warsaw pact 
nations including technical assistance for the soviet union 
the committees senior republican sen jesse helms of north 
carolina said in a letter to sen claiborne pell dri who 
chairs the panel that the feeling of comity has collapsed 
during work on the east europe aid bill 
helms complained that the measure was being rushed into action 
without time for republicans to review it and his aides said the 
bush administration had an extensive list of concerns about the 
measures overall cost and its specific provisions 
unlike foreign aid legislation passed last year in which us 
help was limited to poland and hungary the measure approved 
thursday makes assistance available to any eastern european country 
that bush believes needs help on its road to democratic and 
economic reform 
the bill makes available 535 million for the programs in the 
year that begins oct 1 well in excess of the 300 million bush 
had sought and an increase from the 489 million already approved 
by the house 
pell said the measure would provide an expanded american role 
in the effort to transform eastern europe by helping us 
businesses invest in the countries promoting trade and development 
and encouraging educational and cultural exchanges 
the bill contains 100 million for environmental housing and 
medical assistance it also includes 70 million for the first us 
payment to start up the european bank for reconstruction and 
development an institution set up to encourage east europes 
emergence into the economic mainstream 
but the committees hourlong meeting included almost no 
discussion of the 114page bill members instead defended their 
procedures in bringing it up for action insisting that republicans 
had no cause to boycott the session 
sen joseph biden ddel said he had already made numerous 
changes to accommodate bush administration concerns after meeting 
july 11 with deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger this 
is what the administration wanted biden said 
but in a letter dated tuesday eagleburger told biden that even 
with the changes the administration still prefers the house version 
of the bill 
biden said he was not prepared to sit twiddling our thumbs 
while eastern european economies are in a desperate need of help 
i would at least hope people would show up and take a position 
on the bill rather than boycotting the committees meeting he 
said 
if one party has to govern lets govern said sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny and the democrats voted

president bush today paid tribute to 
richard m nixon as a true architect of peace whose troubled 
presidency helped change the course of the world 
in a glowing tribute at the dedication of the nixon library 
bush said richard nixon was the quintessence of middle america 
a leader who presided over the nation during times perhaps as 
tumultuous as any since lincolns 
ronald reagan and gerald ford joined bush and nixon with their 
wives at the rare gathering of four american presidents for 
ceremonies opening the 21 million library and museum on the site 
of the farmhouse where nixon was born 
speaking to a crowd of thousands on a sweltering hot morning 
bush made only a passing reference to watergate the scandal that 
forced nixon to resign 
sixteen years ago as chairman of the republican national 
committee bush wrote an anguished letter urging nixon to resign 
rather than fight impeachment nixon announced his resignation the 
next day aug 8 1974 
bush said visitors to the nixon library will learn that more 
people voted for richard nixon as president than any other man in 
history 
noting nixons eight books bush said he had an 
intellectuals complexity 
richard nixon was the quintessence of middle america and 
touched deep chords of response in millions of her citizens said 
bush he said nixon invoked a silent majority to support his 
policies during his turbulent years in office 
richard nixon helped change the course not only of america but 
of the entire world said bush he said nixons pathbreaking 
trip to china in 1972 revolutionized the world and recalled 
that it was nixon who signed the first agreement with the soviets 
to limit strategic nuclear arms 
richard nixon endured much in his quest for peace with honor 
in vietnam he knew that true peace means the triumph of freedom 
not merely the absence of war said bush the 41st president 
today as the movement toward democracy sweeps our globe you 
can take real pride that history will say of you here was a true 
architect of peace said bush 
bush also paid tribute to former first lady patricia nixon 
saying she ranks among the most admired women of postwar 
america 
after bush introduced nixon the former president said this 
is the first time ive ever been introduced by the president of the 
united states 
nixon said that in all his world travels nothing we have ever 
seen matches this moment to be welcomed home again so warmly 
jimmy carter the only democrat to occupy the white house since 
nixons presidency was the only living president not at the 
ceremony he had business elsewhere 
im very pleased to be going to this dedication bush told 
reporters wednesday as he flew west with nixons daughter tricia 
cox her husband and son as guests aboard air force one 
it was the first gathering of four presidents since nixon 
carter ford and reagan met at the white house in 1981 after the 
assassination of egyptian president anwar sadat 
reagan at 79 is the oldest of the group both nixon and ford 
are 77 bush is 66 
bushs ties with nixon go back to the early 1960s a decade 
before watergate when bush was a politically ambitious harris 
county republican chairman looking to the former vice president for 
help 
nixon stumped in texas for bush in his unsuccessful race for 
senate in 1964 then again at the kickoff of bushs successful 1966 
run for a house seat from houston 
in his autobiography looking forward bush wrote that he 
was mentioned as a possible running mate for nixon in 1968 after 
passing the texan over for spiro agnew nixon told him i really 
couldnt pick a oneterm congressman 
after bush lost a second senate race in 1970 nixon tapped him 
as ambassador to the united nations and three years later 
recruited him as republican national chairman 
bush stepped into the party job as the watergate scandal was 
erupting over the white house eventually ensnaring nixon for 
ordering a coverup of republican operatives breakin at 
democratic party headquarters in 1972 nixons final months in 
office were a political nightmare bush wrote 
at the end he said he was afraid nixon would bring the party 
down with him if he stayed in office to fight impeachment 
on aug 7 1974 bush wrote the embattled president 
it is my considered judgment that you should now resign i 
now feel that resignation is best for the country best for this 
president 
bush conferred with nixon last fall after the former president 
returned from a visit to china

a radio station wants to give president 
bushs preppy wardrobe the boot during his visit and instead spur 
the chap on to wearing cowboy clothes 
an offhand comment by a denver radio talk show host that bushs 
clothes dont fit the frontier image started the search for the 
perfect if imaginary presidential cowboy wardrobe 
steve kelley of koaam denvers alltalk radio station which 
can be heard in cheyenne noted on the air wednesday that bush 
looks a little too preppy for the west at least as far as were 
concerned 
the result of listeners suggestions and kelleys calls to 
denverarea western clothing stores to find the most outlandish 
duds on the market is a wardrobe that runs the gamut of western 
flash and trash 
the list includes a western shirt complete with rhinestone 
snaps a silverinlaid motherofpearl bolo tie which at 45 bucks 
is not too cheap chaps and ostrichskin cowboy boots the 
boots kelley found run 499 a pair 
like most western getups the presidents makebelieve western 
gear will be capped by a belt buckle of grand proportions 
we wanted to find one that was manholesized because after 
all he is the president but the best we could do was 
dishsized kelley said 
the hardest item to locate was a pair of chaps suggesting to 
kelley that there might be a dearth of real cowboys 
to his amazement the talk show host said he received a call 
from a woman claiming to be from the white house who said the 
president wants to bring some spurs back from his trip out west 
bush was scheduled to be in cheyenne and southeast wyoming for a 
few hours on friday and was planning to do some fishing in addition 
to making a speech marking the states centennial as well as 
frontier days a 92yearold rodeo and western festival 
kelley says he plans to be in cheyenne for the presidential 
visit and will try to come up with a western gift even if he cant

count nikolai tolstoy said thursday he will 
abandon his appeal against a libel award because he cannot afford 
to post a deposit required by the court of appeal 
tolstoy had sought to overturn the record award of 27 million 
to lord aldington whom tolstoy had accused of war crimes during 
world war ii 
three judges of the court of appeal ruled thursday that 
tolstoys appeal had little chance of success and that if he 
wished to proceed he must depost 226000 within 14 days as 
security for aldingtons costs 
i cannot possibly raise that kind of money within 14 days so 
this is the end of the legal road said tolstoy author of the 
book victims of yalta and a descendant of the russian author 
leo tolstoy 
tolstoy wrote a pamphlet that accused aldington of arranging to 
hand over 70000 cossacks and antititoist yugoslavs to their 
communist enemies knowing they faced torture or death aldington 
was brigadier general staff in the eighth army v corps in southern 
austria at the close of world war ii 
lord justice beldam one of the three justices hearing the case 
said tolstoys interpretation of documents lacked in many 
instances the intellectual objectivity and reasoned impartiality 
upon which his reputation is based 
that he failed to convince the jury of the charges against 
lord aldington was amply demonstrated by its unprecedented and 
enormous award beldam said 
the appeal judges refused tolstoy permission to appeal to the 
house of lords they also ordered him to pay the estimated 39800 
costs of the court of appeal hearings

with minorityowned farms disappearing three 
times as fast as whiteowned farms a coalition of religious and 
farm groups called thursday for congressional action to reverse the 
trend 
the coalition joined by about 25 black farmers from across the 
south urged passage of legislation sponsored by sen wyche fowler 
jr dga and rep mike espy dmiss to help minority farmers 
stay in business and provide opportunities for minority youth to 
enter farming 
fowler said the situation has worsened since 1982 when the 
civil rights commission reported that the number of blackowned 
farms in the united states had declined by 94 percent since 1920 
while the commission found that black farms were disappearing 
25 times as fast as whiteowned farms a new study this year by 
the washingtonbased rural coalition found that between 1982 and 
1987 the rate of decline of black farms was 36 times that of 
white farms 
between 1978 and 1987 the study found the number of 
blackowned farms declined 23 percent while the number of 
whiteowned farms dropped by only 66 percent of the nearly 10000 
blackowned farms that were lost during the decade 92 percent were 
in the south 
minority farmers are being plowed under espy said 
and we think that through the policies of usda and the farmers 
home administration theyre being left for weeds 
espy charged that the federal farm credit system has been 
insensitive to the financial needs of minority farmers he said the 
switch in federal farm policy during the 1980s from loans to loan 
guarantees was particularly harmful because many commercial banks 
wont make loans to minority farmers even with government 
guarantees 
espy and fowler said they hope to incorporate their minority 
farmers rights act into the 1990 farm bill which will set the 
nations farm policy for the next five years the senate opened 
debate on its version of the farm bill thursday 
the espyfowler bill would establish policies in the department 
of agriculture to end discrimination in the awarding of federal 
farm benefits create an affirmative action program within the 
department and establish an appeals process for discrimination

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan may 
have offered just the ingredient the administration needs to reach 
a budget deal with congress but ultimately it could poison the 
economy 
one problem is that jittery investors are reading greenspans 
pledge to lower interest rates in exchange for a budget agreement 
as a sign that the fed chief is caving in to political pressure and 
abandoning the fight against inflation 
many economists recalling the experience of the 1960s fear 
that the outcome of all the economic tinkering will be rising 
inflation and weaker growth the worst of all possible worlds and 
a prescription for the very recession the administration wants to 
avoid 
financial markets which normally rally on the promise of lower 
interest rates went into a funk after greenspans wednesday 
promise investors worried about his motivations in discussing 
lower interest rates on a day when the government was reporting a 
worrisome jump in consumer inflation 
the federal reserve as the protector of the nations money 
supply and key defender against inflation is supposed to be above 
the political fray but the timing of greenspans comments raised 
questions about whether the fed chief is now worrying more about 
his possible reappointment by president bush next year than he is 
about keeping inflation under control 
the bush administration has recently intensified its pressure on 
the greenspan fed to relent and lower interest rates the federal 
reserve had been resisting those entreaties contending that a dose 
of high interest rates was needed to slow the economy and thus 
bring inflation under control 
then suddenly last week greenspan took the unusual step of 
announcing fed intentions in advance saying that the central bank 
planned to ease credit slightly to offset overly cautious lending 
practices by the nations banks just a month ago greenspan had 
said he could not detect any broadbased tightening by lenders 
on friday the fed did ease moving to push a key interest rate 
the federal funds rate down to 8 percent it had been at 825 
percent since december 
then this week in his twiceayear appearance before congress to 
explain the feds monetary policy greenspan held out the promise 
of further interest rate declines should congress and the 
administration agree to major substantive credible cuts in the 
budget deficit 
greenspans words were hailed by the administration which wants 
fed participation in any budget deal with congress their fear is 
that the 50 billion to 60 billion in spending cuts and tax 
increases being contemplated to lower the budget deficit would take 
a lot of momentum out of an economy that is already sputtering 
along at nearrecession levels 
the economy as measured by the gross national product grew at 
a subpar 19 percent annual rate in the first three months of 1990 
and by some measurements of employment as many as 16 states are in 
a virtual recession at present 
the administration sought and got greenspans assurance that he 
would loosen monetary policy to offset the huge drop in spending 
power that would come from a deficit deal lower interest rates by 
this reasoning would give a boost to the economy by encouraging 
more business and consumer borrowing 
but what has economists concerned is that the weak growth is 
occurring at a time when inflationary pressures are rising the 
labor department reported wednesday that consumer prices shot up 
05 percent in june and have been rising at an annual rate of 59 
percent so far this year the worst price performance since former 
fed chairman paul volcker was fighting doubledigit rates at the 
beginning of the 1980s 
some economists worry that the nation may be on the verge of 
another bout of stagflation the term coined in the 1970s to 
describe a combination of slow economic growth rising prices and 
rising unemployment 
in such instances the feds ability to lower interest rates to 
boost economic growth is constrained by the need to battle 
inflation 
in addition the financial markets looking at the inflation 
numbers may resist and demand even higher interestrate premiums 
for their investments 
also policies even at the powerful federal reserve work with 
uncertain lag times and the ability to finetune monetary policy 
which is controlled by the fed and budgetary policy controlled by 
congress and the administration has not often been successful 
before 
veteran fed watchers say the last time there was an attempt at a 
coordinated hike in tax revenues and cut in interest rates came 
more than two decades ago 
president lyndon johnson pressured thenfed chairman william 
mcchesney martin to lower interest rates to offset the effects of a 
10 percent tax surchage congress enacted in 1968 to pay for the 
vietnam war 
the tax increase was not enough to offset the stimulative 
effects of the interest rate cuts thus sending inflation 
ratcheting upward and laying the groundwork for a recession which 
began at the end of 1969 ending the nations longest economic 
recovery at just over nine years 
the current recovery which is in its eighth year may be headed 
for the same fate 
there is a parallel between martins situation and greenspans 
situation said david jones chief economist at aubrey g lanston 
amp co who has written two books on fed policy if you make a 
deal with politicians there is always the danger that you will end 
up with the worst of both possible worlds you will get higher 
inflation and lower growth

a rare rabbit found only in the florida 
keys and named after playboy magazine founder hugh hefner was added 
to the federal endangered species list government biologists said 
thursday 
only about 200 of the lower keys marsh rabbits are believed to 
live on a few islands of the archipelago that extends from the 
southern tip of florida 
the animal is the only rabbit among the 1000 creatures on the 
endangered species list said us fish amp wildlife service 
biologist michael bentzien 
but it joins 16 other animals from the islands including the 
key deer already classified as endangered which is not 
surprising said washingtonbased fish amp wildlife biologist jay 
sheppard 
theres only a small amount of habitat left sheppard said 
and for almost all animals found on islands and isolated for a 
period of a time the rule of thumb is a lower fertility rate 
the dark brown marshdwelling rabbits were only identified as a 
separate spcecies in 1980 thanks to the work of the private 
conservation agency and its president james lazell 
he in turn was financed by the playboy foundation and in 
gratitude the rabbits latin name is sylvilagus palustris hefneri 
after hefner 
the marsh rabbits name was entered in the federal register on 
june 21 and the protection goes into effect saturday 30 days 
later said sheppard 
the designation means that no development project funded or 
authorized by the federal government may threaten the rabbits 
habitat and no one may shoot trap or harass the animals said 
sheppard 
the rabbit is not the only florida animal to make the list as of 
saturday 
the littleknown squirrel chimney cave shrimp which lives only 
in an underground sinkhole in alachua county west of gainesville 
also has won that protection 
the unpigmented inchlong shrimp resembles the grass shrimp 
often found along florida rivers but lacks eyes because of its 
underground existence

by the end of the year thousands of mcdonnell 
douglas employees in cities such as long beach calif and st 
louis will be out of work victims of the us victory in the cold 
war 
turning swords into plowshares is not painless rep 
nicholas mavroules dmass said thursday just four days after 
mcdonnell douglas the nations largest military contractor 
announced it was laying off 17000 employees 
mavroules and several other house democrats have crafted 
legislation to assist communities businesses and workers who will 
be hard hit by the certain cuts in defense spending 
the legislation formally known as the economic stabilization 
adjustment and defense industry conversion act of 1990 is the 
product of repeated attempts in congress to produce a 
financialassistance package 
the collapse of the warsaw pact as a military alliance and 
demands at home to reduce military spending gave impetus to the 
legislation mavroules who chairs the house armed services 
subcommittee on investigations held a hearing on the package 
thursday 
the legislation calls for using 200 million from the defense 
budget for retraining workers helping companies switch from 
military to commercial production and providing grants to 
communities among other provisions 
existing economicdevelopment programs such as the defense 
departments office of economic adjustment would be expanded to 
handle the money with the presidents economic stabilization and 
adjustment council providing the oversight 
democrats believe the legislation must be approved this year 
congress tends to react to a crisis rather than planning 
ahead said rep mary rose oakar dohio who testified before 
the armed services panel and then oversaw her own subcommittees 
approval of a section of the economic conversion legislation 
oakar chairs the house banking finance and urban affairs 
subcommittee on economic stabilization 
mavroules said recent estimates from the bush administration 
indicate that the nation has 34 million people working in the 
defense industry about 30000 have been laid off this year and the 
number will likely grow as military spending decreases 
president bush has proposed spending 307 billion on defense in 
the fiscal year beginning oct 1 but the senate armed services 
committee has approved 289 billion the house armed services 
committee is scheduled to craft a bill beginning next week based on 
a budget of 283 billion 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo whose 
constituents will be affected by the mcdonnell douglas layoffs 
criticized the administration for rejecting the concept of economic 
assistance 
secretary of defense richard cheney said and i quote we 
have enough to do just figuring out how to cut the defense budget 
we are not spending lots of time thinking about conversion 
gephardt said that assessment was irresponsible unfair and 
naive 
sen timothy wirth dcolo who also testified before the 
panel said there was little enthusiasm for the economicassistance 
plan in the senate where lawmakers feel uneasy about singling out 
defense when other industries are also facing severe problems 
dr robert m rauner director of the defense departments 
office of economic adjustment said the administration opposes the 
house legislation because it duplicates existing efforts and would 
be costly 
the existing economic adjustment program is comprehensive and 
coordinated rauner said it is tailored to help meet local 
needs

east germany checked the pulse of its economy 
thursday and released a grim diagnosis industrial production has 
plunged and at least 9 percent of its workers have lost all or part 
of their wages 
industrial production fell by 15 percent in june and half a 
million workers have had their hours and salaries slashed since 
july 1 when the nation became a free market and merged its economy 
with west germanys 
the figures follow by one day the governments estimate that up 
to 40000 east germans have been thrown out of work weekly since 
the economic merger 
as it lurches through its first weeks of the free market east 
german lawmakers debated thursday how to pull the country through 
its final months as a nation 
the country is facing a 386 billion deficit in the budget for 
the second half of the year the budget will be the countrys last 
before east germany unites with west germany in december 
while lawmakers debated the budget about 2500 uniformed police 
officers gathered in front of the parliament building to demand 
higher wages to cope with rising food costs 
penalize the guilty not us read a banner carried by the 
demonstrators who hooted and jeered when interior minister 
petermichael diestel told the group the country has no money 
labor minister regine hildebrandt told a news conference that 
about 500000 east german workers have had their hours and wages 
slashed since july 1 
the workers normally would have been laid off but are being 
kept in their factories under a 12 billion program financed by 
west germany 
under the program workers who normally would be targeted for 
layoffs are being paid about 60 percent of their salaries to remain 
in the factories where they are to receive training for other jobs 
on wednesday the government announced that unemployment was at 
223876 in midjune about 27 percent of the 8 million east german 
workers that was up from 30000 jobless in march 
together the number of workers who have either lost their jobs 
or are in the subsidized jobs program is at least 724000 or about 
9 percent of the workforce 
however the actual jobless figure is likely much higher than 
the most recent figures from midjune the government estimated 
wednesday that 30000 to 40000 workers have been thrown out of 
work each week this month 
the government statistics office announced thursday that 
industrial production was down 151 percent in june from the same 
time a year earlier and down 73 percent during the first six 
months of this year compared with the same period last year 
economists say unemployment could reach 3 million within a year 
as uncompetitive east german companies go bankrupt unable to make 
the adjustment from a centrally planned economy to a free market 
on tuesday the government said 2400 of the countrys 8000 
companies 30 percent were unable to pay their bills 
arno donda statistics office chief also said that living costs 
for east germans rose 121 percent in june compared with june 1989 
like the industrial production figure that statistic was 
recorded before the july 1 economic merger when east germanys 
borders were opened to western products prices for basic 
necessities skyrocketed and east german enterprises felt the full 
brunt of western competition 
the east german parliament failed to iron out a feud over 
whether to merge with west germany a day before allgerman 
elections expected on dec 2 or immediately after the vote 
east german lawmakers will meet in a special session on sunday 
and are expected to decide on a date then 
also thursday in a gesture of good will poland removed the 
last stretch of barbed wire on its side of the border with east

democratic house leaders on thursday dismissed 
a private groups charges that they are blocking action on campaign 
finance reform because they are addicted to the current system 
rep al swift chairman of the the elections subcommittee and a 
task force on campaign finance reform said the democrats intend to 
send a proposal to the floor as soon as they work out conflicts 
among themselves 
we cant do it to the timetable of advocates outside the 
institution who say we want it by noon tuesday he said 
public citizen a consumer advocacy group founded in 1971 by 
ralph nader said eight house leaders with direct influence on the 
reform process received an average of 337233 each from political 
action committees in 1988 61 percent of all their campaign 
contributions the group called that a gross conflict of 
interest 
the eight lawmakers examined in the report were house speaker 
thomas s foley dwash majority leader dick gephardt dmo 
majority whip bill gray dpa steny hoyer of maryland and vic 
fazio of california the chairman and vice chairman of the 
democratic caucus chief deputy whip david bonior dmich beryl 
anthony of arkansas chairman of the democratic congressional 
campaign committee and swift dwash 
public citizen said a larger group of 148 democratic house 
leaders including deputy whips and chairmen of committees and 
subcommittees received average pac contributions of 198161 each 
in 1988 52 percent of their warchests 
by contrast the group said republican challengers averaged 
11586 each only 11 percent of their funds 
joan claybrook president of public citizen said the democrats 
seem intent on killing campaign reform legislation this year 
perhaps one of the reasons is that they are addicted to pac funds 
and to the current system 
jeff biggs a foley spokesman said the leadership wants very 
much to have a bill on the floor this year and discussions are 
continuing the suggestion that somehow this has all ground to a 
halt is not true he said 
the house and the senate have been unable so far to agree on a 
bipartisan approach to campaign finance reform proposals in both 
chambers are in flux 
the public citizen report said pacs migrate to legislative 
decisionmakers and pac dollars are very easy to raise it is 
little surprise then that the leadership is endorsing pac reform 
which would do little more than codify the status quo 
the group said that plan proposed by swift would restrict pacs 
with fewer contributors but permit those with many small 
contributors to continue business as usual in addition public 
citizen said the plan puts no aggregate cap on pac receipts and 
does not provide for public financing 
a swift aide however said the final bill is expected to 
restrict pac contributions to a certain percentage or dollar amount 
of a candidates warchest 
swift said pacs are the one area in which public citizens 
concerns have not yet been met he said the group has praised two 
other elements of his proposal closing a loophole that permits 
virtually unlimited spending by parties and voluntary overall 
spending limits with incentives to comply 
positive reinforcement is not one of the tools they use very 
often swift said of the nader group these arent ivory tower 
boys these are people who know how to fight in the street they 
are trying to twist our arm as hard as they can

japan will free up a fiveyear 54 billion loan 
package to china that was frozen after last years bloody crackdown 
on prodemocracy demonstrators the japanese embassy said thursday 
former japanese foreign minister hiroshi mitsuzuka told chinas 
foreign minister qian qichen that the first payment of 405 
million would be made in september followed by another of the same 
amount in february 
japans deputy foreign minister hisashi owada had told qian 
earlier this week that japan planned to gradually resume lending 
but thursdays announcement was the first indication of the 
timetable for china recieving the funds 
the loan package is for 42 projects involving railways 
telecommunications ports power plants airports fertilizer 
plants highways and sewage systems 
freezing the loan package was part of japans sanctions against 
china after the army attack on prodemocracy protestors in june of 
1989 
the seven industrialized powers in an economic summit in 
houston last week decided to maintain economic sanctions imposed 
against china after it killed hundreds perhaps thousands of 
unarmed civilians in crushing a popular democracy movement 
but the summit leaders gave japan tacit approval to resume 
lending which japan says is in the interest of regional stability

red cross rescuers dodged sniper fire 
thursday to remove 11 bloated bodies from a hilltop village in 
south lebanon where proiranian militiamen and syrianbacked rivals 
have fought for four days 
police said two people were killed and five wounded in the 
fighting thursday that raised the casualty toll to 66 people 
killed and 223 wounded since monday when the battles erupted just 
north of israels selfdesignated security zone 
the international committee of the red cross said the 
fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god and the more secular 
amal agreed to observe a brief humanitarian truce thursday 
afternoon to allow the rescuers into iqlim altuffah or apple 
province 
but when the convoy of five lebanese red cross ambulances and 
two red cross cars rolled into jarjou shells rained on the 
embattled hilltop village and the rescuers pulled out emptyhanded 
police said 
an hour later the fighting ebbed into sporadic sniper fire and 
the rescuers wearing masks because of the heavy stench of death 
entered jarjou again 
they wrapped 11 bodies in plastic bags and piled them in the 
ambulances the fighting suddenly escalated and the rescuers sped 
out in the ambulances leaving behind four corpses 
by midafternoon the rugged mountains above sidon provincial 
capital of south lebanon were shaking with artillery and rocket 
blasts it was unclear when the rescuers will be able to bring out 
the remaining bodies 
amal and hezbollah gunners battled with howitzers mortars and 
multibarreled rocketlaunchers caught in the middle were 
palestine liberation organization guerrillas manning a 4milelong 
buffer between amal and hezbollah 
the 600strong plo force had deployed tuesday to end the 
intershiite bloodbath on wednesday six guerrillas were wounded 
when hezbollah fired at their positions one of the victims died in 
hospital thursday police said 
there were no casualties among the guerrillas in thursdays 
duels 
amal and hezbollah have been fighting on and off for three years 
for mastery of the 12 million shiites who make up lebanons 
largest sect 
more than 1100 people have been killed and nearly 3400 wounded 
in the inconclusive showdown 
the hostilities in the south appeared to be spreading slowly to 
the capital beirut where reprisal kidnappings were reported 
during the night 
police said masked gunmen from amal and hezbollah raided houses 
in west and south beirut and abducted at least 40 people belonging 
to the rival groups 
militiamen of the two parties also took to the streets before 
dawn as tension heightened but they fled when syrian troops in 
charge of security in the capitals moslem sector moved in to 
prevent gunplay 
beiruts independent newspaper annahar said the plo has lifted 
an ultimatum for hezbollah to withdraw from jarjou plo chief 
yasser arafats representative in south lebanon zeid webe said 
wednesday that if hezbollah did not withdraw in 24 hours it will 
be evicted 
hezbollah in a statement warned of grave consequences 
resulting from the unjustified palestinian expansion in south 
lebanon 
the plo disengagement force is drawn mainly from arafats 
mainstream fatah faction it intervened to prevent hezbollah from 
seizing nabatiyeh the main shiite town in the central sector of 
south lebanon or thrusting west toward the mediterranean 
hezbollah needs the sea outlet to bring in supplies from iran

california congressmen on thursday praised a 
proposed swap of federal land near los angeles to entertainer bob 
hope for potential parkland acreage despite complaints the deal was 
ramrodded through the national park service 
i too dislike seeing a career park service official 
overruled by a political appointee rep anthony c beilenson 
dcalif testified at a house subcommittee hearing into federal 
land trades but that shouldnt be used as a reason to oppose the 
trade 
even rep george a miller dcalif long a critic of federal 
land trade practices said the deal has its good points 
the deal would involve the trade of 59 acres of federal land 
near los angeles for 5600 acres in the santa monica mountains 
national recreation area key to the deal is a 2300acre tract 
known as jordan ranch owned by hope 
hope wants to build houses and a pga tour golf course on the 
property which the national park service has previously said it 
wants to acquire in order to make the site easily accessible to 
the ventura freeway hope needs to build a road through federal 
land 
the proposed trade would give hope 59 acres of park service land 
so he could build the road in exchange he would give the park 
service 864 acres from a parcel he owns and sell at bargain prices 
or give the remaining 4772 acre he owns on four parcels to a state 
land conservancy 
beilenson rep howard l berman dcalif and other supporters 
say the proposed acquisition the largest single parkland 
acquisition in southern california in two decades probably would 
not be accomplished otherwise because of the soaring real estate 
market and the lack of federal acquisition dollars 
they say the deal would protect wildlife including eagles and 
mountain lions native oaks and provide a corridor for wildlife to 
roam from the mountains to the pacific coast 
the congressmen testified at a hearing of the house government 
operations subcommittee on environment chaired by rep mike synar 
dokla the hearing is the second in a series by the subcommittee 
on the federal practice of acquiring desired federal lands through 
exchanges rather than purchases the practice began more widespread 
during the reagan administration 
miller and others contend public interests are inadequately 
protected because the deals are done in secret critics say also 
that the interior department risks being fleeced by sophisticated 
developers because of a lack of safeguards assuring trades are fair 
critics of this particular deal including sen alan cranston 
dcalif say the park service should not be promoting private land 
development interests especially since the park service wanted the 
jordan ranch land 
synar tried to demonstrate that department employees had 
originally opposed the deal three years ago only to be overruled 
by a political appointee william p horn assistant secretary for 
fish wildlife and parks

vice president dan quayle said thursday the 
president will veto a senatepassed bill to combat job bias unless 
it is purged of provisions the administration contends invite 
hiring quotas house sponsors left the door open to modest changes 
the administration is not going to have a quota bill crammed 
down its throat disguised as a civil rights bill quayle said the 
morning after the senate passed the bill 
house judiciary committee chairman jack brooks dtexas said he 
believed there were enough votes on the house floor to pass the 
bill without changes even if the administration was still 
screaming about quotas 
but he and other democrats suggested the bill could be altered 
one democratic sponsor don edwards of california said were 
going to listen respectfully to any administration proposals 
were going to be discussing one or two items that might make 
them feel a little better 
republicans suggested that democratic willingness to dicker over 
the provisions could signal concern about the chances of overriding 
a bush veto 
its obvious that 34 votes are enough to sustain a veto 
said rep james sensenbrenner rwis speaking of the senate 
margin 
democratic leaders said the bill which tops the civil rights 
movements congressional list most likely would clear its final 
committee hurdle in the house on tuesday without changes 
but house speaker thomas foley dwash said it most likely 
would not reach the house floor until september because of a logjam 
of bills awaiting action 
the bill would effectively overturn five supreme court decisions 
last year that civil rights leaders see as setbacks for their 
movement 
provisions range from banning racial discrimination in the 
workplace to allowing victims to seek punitive damages in the most 
severe discrimination cases 
the sharpest clashes surround a provision that would make it 
easier to challenge hiring practices at companies where the work 
force does not mirror the ethnic makeup of the local labor pool 
until last year it was up to employers who were challenged to 
justify their hiring practices on the basis of business necessity 
a high court ruling last year put the burden of proof on those who 
file the suits to show the hiring motive was other than business 
necessity 
the bill would again put the burden on employers 
the administration maintains that the businessnecessity 
language along with damages provisions would attract lawsuits and 
spur employers to adopt their own unofficial hiring quotas as a 
defensive measure to keep out of court 
bush has said repeatedly that he wants legislation to combat 
discrimination in the workplace but will not sign a bill that would 
lead to hiring quotas 
quayle meeting with reporters in san antonio texas said major 
surgery would be needed before bush could sign the legislation 
passed wednesday night by the senate 
he said there would be enough votes to sustain a veto if the 
measure arrives on the presidents desk in unaltered form 
brooks the democratic chairman of the house judiciary 
committee said he expected the panel to approve the bill without 
any changes on tuesday but left the door open to negotiations 
they havent worked out any compromise with me or with mr 
edwards brooks said i want it written down i want to take a 
look at their suggestions 
senate sponsor edward m kennedy dmass said wednesday night 
he was encouraged by the 65 votes the measure received two short 
of the number needed to override but rep henry j hyde rill 
said he doubted that it would be easy to switch the votes of two 
senators 
hyde also said he believed that senate passage of the measure 
guaranteed that employer groups will start lobbying and do so 
with a vengeance

the explosion thursday at the basf chemical 
plant shattered windows up to four blocks away and sent a cloud of 
black smoke drifting over xavier university where classes were 
called off for the day 
it caused a momentary panic in the residential neighborhood near 
the plant 
i was sitting in my living room talking on the telephone and 
it blew me right out of my chair i thought somebody threw a 
bomb said dorothy douglas who lives about a quarter mile from 
the building 
i heard a big boom and thought a car had hit the building 
then i looked up and glass was falling every which way said 
dilsey freeman a barber at the curtis styles unlimited shop 
two little kids were running past and they were cut by the 
glass and they were bleeding 
flames engulfed the fourstory brick basf building which 
covered most of a city block dozens of workers at the plant were 
injured 
dan delaney who works near the plant said he saw a huge ball 
of fire and smoke out his office window 
shortly thereafter everybody was running down the street out 
of the building to get out sort of in a panic just getting out of 
there as fast as they could delaney said 
the explosion knocked out electrical power and broke windows on 
the xavier campus about four blocks from the explosion site said 
xavier spokesman charlie carey 
it shook the building carey said it knocked out power 
immediately 
smoke from the explosion drifted over campus for about an hour 
before it began to dissipate he said 
carey said the campus was cleared of students and staff and 
remaining afternoon and night classes were canceled exams 
scheduled for thursday night were rescheduled for friday night

russian federation president boris n yeltsin who 
won popular support by denouncing the privileges enjoyed by the 
ruling elite has abolished those luxuries for the republics 
officials tass reported thursday 
the decree did not appear to apply to thousands of highranking 
officials of the national government and communist party who live 
and work in moscow which is both the capital of the soviet union 
and the russian federation the largest of the 15 soviet republics 
the decree from the presidium of the russian parliament that was 
signed by yeltsin abolished all kinds and forms of privileges to 
officials in the russian federation as of aug 1 saying they 
violate social justice the official news agency reported 
abolished were privileges on power on unearned payments on 
undeserved benefits and on undeserved and unearned comfortable 
working and living conditions of organizations enterprises 
offices and workers of the apparatus of state organs 
it said that as of aug 1 all legislative acts resolutions 
instructions and regulations directly or indirectly ensuring 
privileges to officials no matter what posts they hold will 
be considered invalid 
special food and clothing stores sleek black limousines fancy 
homes and highquality medical care for the government and party 
elite have generated massive public resentment in a country where 
there are shortages of housing food and consumer goods 
yeltsin built his election campaign to the national parliament 
on the issue last year and was extremely popular because of it 
there was no explanation why the 2dayold decree which was 
signed tuesday was released only by tass on thursday the russian 
parliament said in the document the mass media had 10 days to 
publish it 
in february soviet president mikhail s gorbachev took some 
action against the privileged elite by deciding the countrys 
current and former leaders excepting himself and premier nikolai 
i ryzhkov were no longer entitled to luxuries such as country 
houses 
many retired members of the communist party politburo some in 
their 90s were ordered to move out they also lost the right to 
their household workers cars and special government food stores 
under public pressure gorbachev last year reluctantly agreed to 
endorse an attack on the privileges given the soviet elite 
many of the soviet elites country houses known as dachas are 
believed to feature tennis courts private swimming pools and 
fountains on the outskirts of moscow they are surrounded by 
fences and guards

the defense department still believes the 
tiltrotor v22 osprey assault transport aircraft isnt worth 
buying despite conclusions of a study showing longterm cost 
advantages over helicopters a top official said thursday 
david chu assistant defense secretary for program analysis and 
evaluation told the senate appropriations defense subcommittee 
that the study by the institute for defense analyses assumes the 
department will have more money to purchase assault transports than 
it will actually have 
that extra money would buy more assault transport capability 
than the marine corps primary user of the v22 for attacking 
defended beaches would need chu said 
the department must figure out how to accomplish its most 
important missions perhaps less well than would be possible with 
more resources while still achieving substantial savings he 
said 
the alternative helicopter forces perhaps in smaller numbers 
at lower investment and operating costs can perform the 
higherpriority dod missions at acceptable levels 
the institutes study acknowledged the higher initial cost of 
the v22 and said that would be offset by lower operating costs 
chu however said those savings in operating costs are dubious 
and would accrue gradually over many years to the extent that they 
occur at all 
as an example he said the institute assumed one helicopter the 
ch47m could be used only 17 hours per day but army data on a 
related model the ch47d suggest availability of four hours per 
day 
moreover the ida study assumes we can change operational 
practices to play to the v22s major strengths but downplays the 
advantages of the larger helicopters in the alternative forces 
chu said 
chu said the ospreys would cost about 37 billion more during 
fiscal years 1991 through 1997 than secretary of the navy h 
lawrence garrett iii recommended be spent on medium airlift 
released three weeks ago the institutes study was ballyhooed 
by congressional backers of the aircraft which received no 
production money for the current year after defense secretary dick 
cheney said he wanted to kill it 
congress ordered the study but the pentagon chose the 
institute a nonprofit group with close ties to the pentagon to 
perform it 
cheney has cited the case of the osprey as illustrating the 
difficulty of killing any program even when many in congress cry 
for smaller defense budgets 
with its twin endofwing propellers pointed up the osprey can 
take off like a helicopter and then can rotate the propellers to 
point forward and fly like a plane faster and farther than 
helicopters 
its prime contractors are boeing helicopters a suburban 
philadelphia division of boeing co and bell helicopter textron of 
fort worth texas 
the senate armed services committee has authorized 238 million 
in osprey research and development money for the new fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 that money would have to be made available in an 
appropriations bill and backers hope to get production funds as 
well

milk prices at the farm declined last winter 
but regained some of their lost ground during the spring that also 
pushed up consumer prices an agriculture department report said 
thursday 
however continued substantial growth in milk production and 
reductions in probably swollen user inventories of nonfat dry milk 
likely will limit further advances in milk and dairy product 
prices the report said 
milk production was up more than 2 percent during the apriljune 
quarter from yearearlier levels the number of cows held about 
steady but milk output per cow was up 
high farm milk prices since 1989 spurred the expansion 
although financial caution and forage concerns have restrained 
growth the report said 
milk production in the second half of 1990 probably will rise 
about 3 percent from a year earlier the report said that would 
raise total 1990 milk output by about 2 percent from last year 
if wholesale prices hold relatively steady for the rest of 1990 
analysts said the average price increase for farm milk prices may 
be in the range of 3 percent to 5 percent for the entire year 
the overall retail prices of dairy products including milk 
cheese butter and other products were up about 10 percent from a 
year earlier during the second quarter as widening price spreads 
between producers and consumers more than matched the increase in 
farm milk prices 
retail prices during the rest of 1990 likely will remain near 
recent levels and the increases from 1989 are expected to average 
8 percent to 10 percent for the year the report said

presidency in 1974 since then the nixons have moved to a large 
estate in new jersey there too neighbors seldom see her

a majority of farmers would support changes in 
federal law to help protect the nations environment a survey by a 
national conservation group said thursday 
officials of the american farmland trust said the survey 
provided strong evidence that farmers are more supportive of 
environmentally sound farming practices than their washington 
lobbyists admit 
the survey results were released as the senate began debate on 
the 1990 farm bill a complex measure that will guide us farm 
programs and policy for the next five years 
in recent months the aft said much of the debate about farm 
bill amendments has centered on alleged farmer resistance to 
changes in federal law to help clean up the environment including 
reduced use of chemicals and fertilizers 
according to the survey more than 70 percent of about 1000 
farmers interviewed in 22 states were interested in participating 
in a federal costsharing program that would reduce contamination 
of water through the adoption of new farm management practices 
further the aft said majorities of these farmers approve of 
pesticide and fertilizer use plans that would help farmers 
economize on the use of these materials 
ralph grossi president of aft a nonprofit washingtonbased 
membership organization said he gave house and senate agriculture 
committees high marks for their efforts to protect wetlands and set 
the right course on water quality planning and flexible cropland 
use 
but he added i give them very low marks on longterm soil 
protection promotion of environmentally sustainable farming and 
protection of farmland from urban encroachment 
the survey and its analysis was conducted for aft by a team at 
northern illinois university it was based on about 1000 
interviews from a data base of 1435 said spokesman david dyer 
the survey was said to have a margin error of approximately 5 
percent 
the data base was selected randomly from 42860 producers of six 
major federally supported commodities corn wheat rice cotton 
peanuts and milk in 100 counties of 22 states 
dyer said the survey was designed to reflect national attitudes 
it did not show state breakdowns 
the states where the survey was conducted are alabama arkansas 
california georgia iowa illinois indiana kansas louisiana 
michigan minnesota missouri montana north dakota nebraska new 
york ohio oklahoma pennsylvania texas washington and wisconsin

bright yellow happyface pins emblazoned 
with the governors name are part of a public service campaign 
officials say but some state employees complain the buttons are 
for his reelection campaign 
the lapel buttons which also feature the slogan yes we 
can are part of a campaign organized by gov william donald 
schaefers office to encourage marylands 70000 state employees to 
offer the public service with a smile 
some state employees complained that they were being used in an 
election year 
it certainly did appear that it was politically motivated 
william bolander executive director of the state chapter of the 
american federation of state county and municipal employees said 
thursday 
bolander said he was not blaming the democratic governor who 
may not have had anything to do with putting his name on the pins 
bolander said he also supports the campaign to improve service 
to the public 
its just the way you go about it he said you could get 
that message across without having the governors name attached to 
everything 
this has absolutely no political overtones whatsoever 
schaefer press secretary paul schurick said angrily i am deeply 
insulted by anyone who questions the motives of a campaign to 
improve public service 
schaefer said he wasnt worried about the complaints because 
only the press is upset about the buttons 
its not a campaign gimmick but an attempt to make state 
employees better public servants he said 
just putting a button on theres nothing wrong with 
that schaefer said 
schurick said having schaefers name on the button is in keeping 
with the policy he has followed for 19 years as mayor of baltimore 
and governor 
the governor has made a career out of don schaefer he is 
wellknown for highprofile campaigns of all kinds with his name 
attached schurick said 
the governor cannot stop being governor just because its an 
election year he said 
most of the complaints came from employees of the department of 
general services who were told in a july 6 memo all dgs 
employees are to wear their yes we can buttons during working 
hours 
robert b silver who wrote the memo said it was a request not 
an order 
if they choose not to wear the buttons there is no 
disciplinary action thats going to be taken he said 
william seth shepard who is seeking the republican nomination 
for governor said incumbents such as schaefer should show 
selfrestraint in putting their names on billboards buttons 
and other paraphernalia purportedly promoting the state 
fred griisser a real estate agent and gun control foe trying to 
upset schaefer in the democratic primary said it was 
inappropriate for state workers to be told to wear the buttons 
it obviously looks like they are expected to promote him for 
the office he said

despite el salvadors intention to prod peace 
talks past the sticky subject of an armed forces overhaul leftist 
rebels say they will insist on a purge of officers they allege are 
responsible for human rights abuses 
the two sides meet friday in costa rica for a third round of 
unmediated peace talks that began in venezuela in may 
guerrilla leaders say they are preparing a major offensive 
perhaps on the scale of novembers push if the new talks make no 
progress 
the farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln has 
fought usbacked governments since 1979 the war has killed an 
estimated 72000 people 
there is a sector of the armed forces that must pay the bill 
for so much oppression imposed on the country guerrilla 
commander schafik handal the chief rebel negotiator said in an 
interview with the associated press at the rebels mexico city 
office 
handal rejected the governments call to a ceasefire while 
negotiations proceed 
first there must be agreements on how to demilitarize 
salvadoran society if we halt military pressure recalcitrant 
elements would feel free to embark on a bloodbath like that of the 
early 1980s he said 
during those years troops and militarylinked death squads 
summarily executed about 30000 suspected leftists according to 
international rights groups no officer has been convicted or tried 
for such a crime 
the us congress which has financed the government war effort 
intends to reduce and condition military aid for the 1991 financial 
year which begins in october draft legislation makes disbursement 
of some funds dependent on progress in peace talks and on 
successful prosecution of the army men responsible for novembers 
massacre of six jesuit priesteducators 
some legislators echoed the guerrillas demand for a purge sen 
christopher dodd dconn said this week about 50 upperechelon 
officers should be removed he predicted that the war would go on 
for years in the absence of drastic military reform 
fifty seems to us a low number said handal major guerrilla 
leaders have mentioned the figure 200 when estimating how many 
officers should be purged 
we do not reject the idea of purifying our institution the 
armed forces like any other insitution is subject to evolution to 
improvement said gen humberto larios the defense minister in 
a recent interview but he insisted the military must do the 
weedingout 
we are purifying ourselves he said 
handal replied if larios maintains that the army is being 
constantly purified and nevertheless it continues to play the 
role of repressor then its obvious that purification is not 
enough to clean it up it should be abolished flatout which is 
our conclusion 
the fmln proposes that accords on gradual demilitarization 
which would include its own disappearance as a fighting force 
conclude with abolishment of the armed forces 
the rebels point to costa rica which abolished its army in 1949 
and is the only central american nation to enjoy in recent decades 
a stable and functioning democracy 
a civilianled police force would ensure law and order in a 
demilitarized el salvador according to the fmln proposal 
larios and other military chiefs bristle at idea of their 
institution disappearing 
the continued existence of the armed forces is not a subject 
of discussion president alfredo cristiani said after last 
months fiveday round of talks in mexico 
that session dealt almost exclusively with the military and 
produced no argeement 
the agenda worked out in venezuela also includes rights 
judicial electoral and constitutional reform and means of 
international verification of compliance with eventual accords 
cristiani says prospects for agreement on those points are good 
the guerrillas say accords on other issues would be moot in the 
absence of agreement on military overhaul

also arrested was roy hatch 42 who lived with scholl a third 
man salvatore ditrapani 43 was arrested at his home in hazlet 
nj 
new york city district attorney robert m morgenthau issued a 
statement saying the three men pocketed liability insurance 
premiums for several major new york law and accounting firms 
starting in 1986 
officers also executed search warrants at local banks where they 
believed scholl rented safe deposit boxes according to thomas 
jackson supervising investigator for the morgenthaus office 
jackson one of the arresting officers said scholls 20room 
house purchased in 1986 for 680000 was filled with antique 
furniture and artwork

reportedly held sunday for a local hospital 
scholl was an accomplished tenor and most of his society 
contacts involved music he performed in may at the annual 
champagne and strings benefit for the academy of childrens 
music in fort washington pa 
the grand larceny complaint alleged the three men used the money 
they took from the premiums to buy homes securities 
automobiles paintings rare books antiques and other items 
hatchs attorney glen a zeitz described the case in court as 
a dispute over commissions the two defendants led into the 
courtroom in handcuffs wouldnt speak with reporters 
according to the district attorneys statement several 
companies sought insurance through minet international which is 
based in montreal and the united kingdom 
minet put together a group of insurance underwriters including 
american international underwriters where scholl worked from 1986 
to 1988 and transatlantic reinsurance co where ditrapani worked 
scholl and ditrapani allegedly instructed minet to pay premiums 
to an intermediary the international reinsurance brokerage 
operation which was controlled by hatch 
scholl and ditrapani wrote policies for the coverage but never 
filed them with their companies according to morgenthau instead 
they split up the premiums with hatch 
scholl and hatch were arraigned wednesday before judge benjamin 
crahalla in lower providence township each was ordered held in 
montgomery county prison in lieu of 5 million bail on a fugitive

only four states in the nation do not have 
grassroots organizations opposed to smoking and three of those 
states are linked to the nasty habit through the tobacco industry 
the government reported thursday 
hawaii kentucky mississippi and south carolina are the only 
states without such antismoking groups said the report by the 
federal centers for disease control 
kentucky and south carolina are leading tobacco producers noted 
tom novotny of the cdcs office on smoking and health mississippi 
also grows a small amount of tobacco 
the cdcs annual behavioral risk factor survey earlier this 
month showed kentucky to be the state with the highest number of 
smokers thirtyfour percent of the adult respondents to the study 
in kentucky said they were smokers 
the tobacco issue is something else in kentucky said 
phyllis skonicki manager of the health promotion branch for the 
kentucky department of health services were one of the largest 
growing states in the nation from the smallest farm to the 
largest youre going to find some tobacco 
in the united states 29 percent of the adults age 18 and older 
smoke according to the cdcs latest statistics 
the antismoking coalitions are made up of community volunteers 
sometimes aided by public health workers their growing number 
represents an increasing level of concern in the government and 
among people not strictly in the health field said novotny who 
prepared the report 
it just shows a strong sort of grassroots institutionalized 
effort to take on the problem of tobacco use he said theres 
been a general shift in the social attitude smoking no longer is 
seen as socially acceptable its continually identified as the 
major cause of preventable death in this country 
a total of 390000 people in the united states died from 
smokingrelated illnesses in 1985 the last year for which 
statistics are available novotny said it will undoubtedly be 
more than that when the figures are updated we know lung cancer 
has increased since then 
restrictions on smoking in public places have grown with concern 
about the health hazards involved with smoking he said 
colorado established the first grassroots antismoking 
coalition in 1963 the cdc said most of the other states formed 
coalitions after 1984

most american employers are worried about a 
shortage of skilled workers but few have made job training for new 
employees a priority according to a study delivered to congress 
thursday 
a majority of 645 employers who were surveyed said they thought 
there was already a labor shortage in america or one on the way 
according to a study called workforce 2000 competing in a 
sellers market is corporate america prepared 
employers are specifically concerned about a potential shortfall 
of socalled knowledge workers who are professionals or have 
technical skills said the study conducted by towers perrin a 
management consultant firm 
those knowledge workers are also sometimes called gold 
collar employees because demand for them is expected to be so 
great that they will be able to name their own salaries and the 
conditions of their employment the study said those workers 
include people in such fields as electronics computers and 
communications who have technical skills 
whether or not knowledge workers will have such bargaining 
power our survey companies are clearly worried about hiring these 
important employees especially over the next five years the 
study said 
however the study said most companies are still using 
traditional solutions for recruitment or helping employees learn 
and improve skills rather than trying novel approaches 
for instance 78 percent of the firms use the traditional 
process of reimbursing employees for the costs of tuition while 
just 8 percent have their own remedial training program the study 
said 
the most common reason for rejecting potential job candidates 
was inadequate writing or verbal skills the study said but few 
firms had made training a priority 
twothirds of the firms surveyed spent less than 2000 a year 
on training for entrylevel hires and many companies spend nothing 
at all the study said 
about half of the survey respondents reported hiring more than 
150 entrylevel workers a year of those new hires about 28 
percent end up quitting or being fired within their first year 
usually because of an unacceptable job performance the study said 
the high cost of turnover notwithstanding most companies do 
not appear to be devoting significant financial resources to 
training said the study 
about 5 percent of the employers spent more than 5000 annually 
in classroom and onthejob training for new employees in their 
first year 
the study was delivered at a senate labor task force hearing on 
the workforce and workplace readiness 
sen barbara mikulski dmd who chairs the task force said 
the study reveals that most companies run their businesses like 
we were still in the 1950s

prosecutors accused one of marion barrys 
security guards of using cocaine thursday interrupting the guards 
testimony as the leadoff defense witness in the mayors drug and 
perjury trial 
prosecutors also suggested that the guard washington police 
officer james stays had told another policeman the name of a barry 
drug supplier 
stays denied he had made such a statement then the jury was 
sent out of the room before prosecutors made the druguse 
allegation in remarks to us district court judge thomas penfield 
jackson 
jackson rejecting defense objections ruled that stays could be 
questioned about using cocaine but suspended proceedings to allow 
him to consult with a lawyer 
after a lunch recess stays twice denied using drugs when 
retchin asked about the subject on further questioning from barry 
attorney robert mance stays also denied talking to the other 
officer about a drug supplier 
outside the courtroom barry accused the prosecution of 
satanic dirtlike tactics 
the surprise developments came as assistant us attorney judith 
retchin began crossexamining stays a member of the elite 
24member security detail that accompanies barry to all his public 
and private functions all members are police officers 
the jury heard only this exchange on the subject 
retchin did you tell detective goodwine another security 
officer that willie davis supplied mr barry with cocaine 
stays me no 
after jurors were sent out of the courtroom retchin told the 
judge the government has evidence that this witness has used 
cocaine 
the issue came up after stays testified he knew willie davis a 
man whom government witnesses have testified used cocaine with 
barry 
davis a former aide to birmingham ala mayor richard 
arrington has not been called to testify in the case 
after a 30minute recess jackson ruled over the protests of 
barry attorney r kenneth mundy that retchin could pursue her line 
of questioning 
i deem miss retchins crossexamination of mr stays to be 
related to the credibility of the witness jackson said the 
defense has asked prosecution witnesses at great length about 
their prior drug use 
mundy argued that stays had no knowledge of barry drug use and 
had not told other security officers the name of anyone supplying 
drugs to the mayor 
stays at one point had demanded to take a urinalysis test to 
determine whether he used drugs when asked about it by other police 
detectives working on barrys case the mayors attorney said 
he is anxious to come in here and answer and lay any 
rumors to rest mundy said 
officers from the internal affairs division have informed me 
he stays was not willing to take a urinalysis retchin 
retorted there has been testimony under oath before the grand 
jury of mr stays own drug use 
when she resumed her questioning of stays retchin asked whether 
he had used drugs at a private home in kettering md or in a 
suite at a washington hotel where barry and others were present 
stays answered no to each query defense lawyer mance said outside 
court that barry had told him he had never used drugs with any 
defense witnesses 
later officer warren goodwine a former member of barrys 
security force said under crossexamination that he told police 
investigators he tried to stay out of mr barrys activities as 
much as possible 
under further questioning from mance goodwine said he had not 
meant to suggest he suspected that the mayor used drugs 
if i said that i felt the mayor was entitled to some 
privacy goodwine testified 
he was not asked about the question concerning what stays might 
have told him about a barry drug supplier 
earlier thursday stays had contradicted minor points in the 
testimony of a key government witness 
stays a 29year police veteran said that he never babysat the 
children of rasheeda moore and never delivered money to her 
moore the governments star witness had testified that stays 
looked after her children on one occasion while she and the mayor 
used drugs she also told the court that stays had delivered to her 
a package from the mayor that contained money for drugs 
before the defense began making its case thursday jackson 
denied motions to acquit barry of four of the 14 charges against 
him on wednesday he rejected a similar effort with regard to the 
other 10 counts the mayor faces 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy count and 
three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his alleged 
drug use

a panel of experts recommended the food and 
drug administration turn down an application to market the nations 
first home bloodcollection kit for aids antibody testing 
the fdas blood products advisory committee on wednesday voted 
31 against approval of the proposal by university hospital 
laboratories corp of bethesda md 
with the companys test kit an individual would use a lancet to 
draw a small sample of blood which would be collected on special 
filter paper and send the sample anonymously to a laboratory where 
it would be tested the individual would receive the results by 
telephone 
panel members echoed the fdas concerns about the safety of 
people drawing their own blood and the validity of tests obtained 
through this system said dr jay s epstein chief of the 
retrovirology laboratory in fdas center for biologics evaluation 
and research 
the experts also were concerned about the adequacy of telephone 
counseling for individuals who test positive for antibodies to the 
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome he said 
the fda is also concerned whether anonymous aidsrelated testing 
is in the public interest since public health workers would be 
unable to follow up on counseling for individuals who tested 
positive 
epstein said on thursday the fda would complete its review of 
university hospital laboratories application by aug 8 
the fda began accepting applications for aids home test kits 
last spring after officials said they would reconsider their 
opposition to home bloodcollection kits for aidsrelated testing 
university hospital laboratories application was the first 
received epstein said but he could not say how many others if 
any have been received since then 
at the time dr paul parkman director of the center for 
biologics evaluation and research said officials were persuaded to 
rethink their opposition because of medical advances in treatment 
that could slow progression of the disease in its early stages 
other considerations included technical advances that for 
example have shown accurate test results could be obtained using a 
blood sample prepared and transported on a filter paper 
university hospital laboratories had filed a lawsuit seeking to 
force the fda to accept its application which had been filed in 
december 1987 
the lawsuit was settled april 10 but fda officials said the 
lawsuit had no effect on its decision to begin accepting 
applications 
epstein said the advisory committees recommendation affected 
only university health laboratories application

rules 
the federal communications commission inspections carried out

programming rules w

determine how well stations are complying and lead to more 
voluntary compliance

worth philadelphia portland ore and san francisco the fcc 
said the stations were chosen because of their diverse locations 
and because they serve large areas

wealthy americans and texans would bear a 
greater burden of the savings and loan bailout under separate bills 
filed in congress thursday 
rep joseph p kennedy ii dmass backed by consumer advocate 
ralph nader argued that wealthy investors used federal protection 
for up to 100000 in deposits to reap substantial interest income 
now that scores of sampls have gone under poor and middle class 
taxpayers are unfairly being asked to pay he said 
kennedy proposed legislation that would raise 100 billion in 
bailout costs over five years by imposing three new taxes a 75 
percent surtax on interest dividends and capital gains for 
individuals reporting income more than 100000 per year a 5 
percent surtax on corporations earning more than 75000 per year 
and elimination of an inheritance tax provision that forgives taxes 
on appreciated capital gains at death 
the bailout represents nothing less than the single largest 
transfer of wealth from the working class to the wealthy in the 
history of america kennedy said at a capitol hill news 
conference the working people of america must not be made to pay 
for a party that they were not invited to 
the northeastmidwest congressional coalition proposed 
legislation that would shift the burden of the bailout 
geographically rather than based on income the coalition bill 
would remove federal deposit insurance benefits from 
stateregulated sampls or require state taxpayers to bear a heftier 
share of the bailout 
in some instances backers say deregulation at the state level 
led to lending and investment abuses at sampls if states caused the 
problem the coalition argues federal taxpayers shouldnt be 
forced to pay all of the bailout 
as it currently stands the bill would only affect texas 
according to keith laughlin who drafted the bill of the 57 
billion in bailout costs to date 209 billion is attributable to 
statechartered banks in texas if all the sampls in question seek to 
retain federal deposit insurance the state would pay an extra 28 
billion toward the bailout

new fighting between ethnic kirghiz and uzbeks in 
soviet central asia has increased the death toll to 212 and 
incidents of sadistic cruelty have taken place state media 
reported thursday 
the newspaper rabochaya tribuna said about 1200 people have 
been hospitalized from violence since early june 
on wednesday 204 people had been reported killed in the 
fighting which broke out june 4 in western kirghizia in a land 
dispute between the ethnic groups both largely sunni moslems who 
speak turkish dialects 
tass said thursday reports are still coming in of fights 
arson and pogroms passing cars are being stoned barricades are 
being built 
tensions had eased during 40 days of mourning for those killed 
in the june fighting but violence flared again this week when that 
period ended 
most of the fighting has raged in osh this weeks violence shut 
down industrial enterprises and snarled public transport interfax 
news service said in nearby uzgen which is predominantly uzbek 
residents demand that soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov go to the 
region it said 
soviet authorities bolstered security troops in the region by 
sending col gen yuri shatalin commander of interior ministry 
troops there tass said 
the unrest has caused an estimated 68 million in damage and 
left more than 400 people missing and possibly dead rabochaya 
tribuna said earlier soviet media had reported 800 people were 
missing in the area 
the newspaper said security police have been informed of 65 to 
80 burials that have yet to be investigated it said there have 
been cases of sadistic cruelty but gave no specifics 
of the 212 dead at least 132 are uzbeks and 47 are kirghiz the 
paper said it did not give the nationalities of the other victims 
in reporting on causes of the bloodshed rabochaya tribuna said 
unemployment has tripled in the region the past five years 
reaching 47000 by the time violence broke out 
many of the jobless are youths who no longer want to live in 
rural areas and have flooded cities and towns looking for housing

a new lithuanian law conscripting young men into 
the service of the secessionist republic rather than the national 
army further clouds an already gloomy draft outlook for the soviet 
armed forces 
the lithuanian law passed wednesday does not create a separate 
army it requires instead a year of mandatory civic service or 
military training for men aged 19 to 26 said simas ardziunas a 
representative of the parliaments information bureau 
results of the annual spring draft for the soviet armed forces 
read like a barometer of regional dissent about half or fewer 
conscripts reported for duty in the secessionist baltic republics 
and the troubled southern republics of georgia and armenia had even 
lower rates 
only 336 percent of draftage lithuanian men reported as 
required this year for the red army compared to 916 percent last 
year the soviet army newspaper red star reported last week 
the rates in latvia were 907 percent last year and 542 percent 
this year and estonia 795 percent last year and 402 percent 
this year 
the worst rate was in armenia 75 percent influenced by a law 
passed by the republic requiring young men to remain there to 
continue repair work from the december 1988 earthquake 
red star quoted lt gen n tergrigoryants as complaining about 
laws passed by republics restricting military service outside their 
borders 
he said 6500 young men did not report for service last year 
numbers for this year are not yet known he said 
the article did not disclose the total number of draftees an 
armed forces spokesman said all inquiries should be directed by 
letter through the ministry of foreign affars 
the soviet armed forces contain about 51 million people 
according to the international institute for strategic studies in 
london 
the kremlin had no immediate reaction to the new lithuanian law 
passed by the republics supreme council parliament on a 6816 
vote with 22 abstentions 
ardziunas said the legislation would not go into effect until 
the government issues a directive on details of service no 
barracks or camps yet exist for the force and the law says 
nothing about any weapons he said 
youths in the force would be available for border service and in 
case of natural disasters he said 
thousands of soviet troops remain in lithuania although the 
republic declared its independence from the soviet union on march 
11 lithuania then became embroiled in a dispute with mikhail s 
gorbachev and he imposed an economic embargo to force it into line 
on june 29 the lithuanian supreme council approved a moratorium 
on the declaration to take effect when talks with soviet officials 
begin on independence soviet officials immediately began lifting 
the embargo

the former executive director of the 
montana republican party has accused the organization its 
chairwoman and a national gop committee of breaking federal 
racketeering laws 
the allegations involved the handling of political money during 
the 1988 campaigns 
terry merica made the allegations in a complaint filed in us 
district court on wednesday it amends a lawsuit he and his wife 
neida filed in december 
the complaint alleges that the state gop chairwoman barbara 
campbell and the national republican senatorial committee committed 
wire and mail fraud by illegally funneling money into the campaigns 
of sen conrad burns and gov stan stephens 
burns at the time a county commissioner in billings upset 
democratic incumbent sen john melcher in the november election 
stephens defeated former democratic gov tom judge in the race for 
governor 
the complaint says the defendants used a series of letters and 
money transfers in the spring and summer of 1988 to defraud the 
citizens of montana and the united states 
the original lawsuit alleged the mericas were fired in late 1988 
for questioning whether financial dealings between the state 
republican party and the national committee violated state and 
federal election laws 
neida merica was an administrative secretary for the state gop 
wednesdays complaint contends there were additional violations 
of the federal racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act 
charles erdmann attorney for the montana gop said the new 
contentions may reflect mericas concern that the original suit 
will be dismissed 
this may be nothing more than an attempt to bolster their 
complaint he said 
he would not comment on specifics saying he had not seen the 
new complaint but he questioned the timing of its filing the 
state gop convention began thursday in billings with president 
bush scheduled to appear in the evening on behalf of lt gov allen 
kolstad who is challenging democratic incumbent sen max baucus 
the timing of this would make you think this is politically 
motivated campbell said thursday 
james goetz the mericas attorney said the timing was 
coincidence 
the national republican senatorial committee which helps 
organize campaigns of gop senate candidates had no immediate 
comment on the new allegations 
the complaint alleges the defendants committed mail and wire 
fraud by not legally reporting as much as 200000 in campaign 
contributions in 1988 
it cites several instances of questionable handling of campaign 
financing it alleges that 
the national committee conducted a voter identification project 
in montana but gave results only to the burns and stephens 
campaigns the cost of the project was never reported as a 
contribution to the campaigns and the expense exceeded the federal 
limit on what such committees can give to a candidate 
the national committee transferred thousands of dollars through 
the montana gops accounts to help pay for a direct mailing by a 
texas company for the burns campaign in violation of federal 
election laws 
between aug 8 1988 and nov 16 1988 the national committee 
shifted 178145 into the montana gops account the money 
transfers prompted a nov 8 memo from ward shanahan the state 
partys lawyer to gop headquarters warning that the national 
committee was using the montana republican party for financial 
shenanigans 
in october 1988 the republican governors association gave 
8000 to the montana gop with a letter from executive director 
michele davis saying the money should be reported as coming from 
the republican national committee

a measles epidemic in washington state was spread 
in large part by unvaccinated immigrants who brought the virus from 
mexico federal health officials said thursday 
at least 26 percent of the 266 measles cases reported in 
washington state so far this year were acquired in mexico or were 
linked to cases acquired there the centers for disease control 
said in its weekly report 
last year 15 percent of all cases reported in the state were 
linked to mexico it said nationwide 3 percent of the 17850 
measles cases reported last year were acquired outside the united 
states it said 
across the country measles continue to be spread in medical 
settings especially hospital emergency rooms because cases often 
are not diagnosed and isolated promptly and because many medical 
workers are not immune the cdc said 
in the first 26 weeks of 1990 nearly five times more cases were 
diagnosed in washington than during all of 1989 when 55 measles 
cases were reported state health officials said the outbreak is 
the largest since 1979 
nearly half of the cases occurred among unvaccinated people the 
cdc said 
of those unvaccinated more than half were hispanics who 
account for 4 percent of the states population of 45 million and 
are its largest ethnic minority the states hispanic population 
increased by about 39 percent from 1980 to 1988 the cdc said 
detailed data available for 218 of the 266 cases showed that 97 
of them were hispanics the cdc said of those 97 cases mexican 
citizens working in washington accounted for 72 percent and 
hispanic us citizens made up 28 percent 
the state department of health spent 11 million for 76000 
doses of measles vaccine this spring said barbara baker 
washingtons immunization director 
vaccination clinics were publicized in spanish and english on 
radio and television in newspapers and by sound trucks in hispanic 
neighborhoods she said

the state department accused leftist rebels in 
el salvador on thursday of engaging in a campaign of violence and 
said they should change tactics in the interests of reaching a 
peace settlement 
deputy spokesman richard boucher said the insurgents have 
carried out a series of brutal assassinations directed at 
salvadoran military personnel and their families 
the purpose of this violence seems to be to polarize the 
situation further and to elicit a reaction from extremists on the 
right boucher said 
as examples boucher cited the recent murders of a salvadoran 
offduty officer and of an army major who was on his way to law 
school 
he said the rebels also are preparing for a military offensive 
he added that ongoing peace talks with the government can only 
succeed if both parties negotiate seriously and honestly 
with talks set to resume friday in costa rica boucher said the 
insurgents should put aside its tractics of assassination and 
violence and go to the table committed to a just peace

richard nixon a political outcast no 
more basked thursday in the praise of three other men who held 
americas highest office during a ceremony where the word watergate 
was mentioned only once 
that mention almost in passing came from george bush 
the president and former presidents gerald ford and ronald 
reagan along with their wives joined to give the new nixon 
library and birthplace a festive sendoff it was an occasion as 
red white and blue as the thousands of balloons that were released 
at the end of the 2hour ceremony 
never before have four presidents of the united states shared 
the same speaking platform although nixon ford and jimmy carter 
were together at a reception given in the white house by reagan 
before the three flew to egyptian president anwar sadats funeral 
in 1981 
bush said that visitors for years to come will learn of nixons 
six crises the title of his first book and the seventh 
crisis watergate 
none of the other speakers mentioned the scandal that drove 
nixon from office in 1974 
for nixon it was a major milestone in his relentless drive for 
acceptance the man who was elected with the most votes in history 
had been shunned by fellow republicans at their national 
conventions and only in recent years has been invited to their 
functions 
this is a very special day for all of us he told a crowd of 
more than 10000 nothing we have ever seen matches this moment 
to be welcomed so warmly 
bush led the tributes to the 37th president 
to occupy this office is to feel a kinship with these and 
other presidents he said each of whom in his own way sought 
to do right and thus achieve good each wondered i suspect 
how they could be worthy of god and man 
bush who as chairman of the republican party in 1974 urged 
nixon to resign urged visitors to the 21 million library to 
look at richard nixon the man 
nixon said bush was the quintessence of middle america who 
touched a cord with millions of citizens 
he loved americas good quiet decent people he spoke for 
them he felt deeply on their behalf 
ford who served out nixons term began his speech with mr 
president mr president mr president if i overlooked a 
president will he please stand up 
he told nixon this day is a celebration richly deserved by 
you and by pat 
reagan said the world is a better place a safer place 
because of richard nixon 
the library adjacent to the 900footsquare house where nixon 
was born 77 years ago tells the story of nixons life from his 
boyhood through the political offices he held congressman 
senator vice president and president the exhibits also include a 
treatment of watergate the scandal that was nixons undoing 
the audience in 90degree heat outdoors was said by library 
spokesman fred gorell to number 40000 police however estimated 
the crowd at 10000plus 
most of the crowd was on the suburban streets surrounding the 
spacious library grounds 25 miles southeast of downtown los 
angeles within the building there were 2400 seats for invited 
visitors and bleacher space for 1400 
many stalwarts from the nixon administration showed up former 
secretaries of state henry kissinger and william rogers were in the 
audience as was alexander haig nixons chief of staff in the 
final year and william simon nixons secretary of the treasury 
some protesters showed up and two were ejected outside on yorba 
linda boulevard people waved signs saying hes still tricky 
dick and richard repent 
evangelist billy graham an old nixon friend and frequent guest 
in the nixon white house spoke in his opening prayer of the 
upheavals and uncertainties through which the world passed during 
the nixon era 
simon chairman of the foundation that built the library with 
21 million in private funds also touched on the controversies 
that surrounded nixon throughout his 25year political career 
despite all of that as well as the unrelenting hostility from 
the national media president nixon managed to lead america out of 
the vietnam war and bring back our pows 
before the ceremony in the cool of the library nixon was asked 
how he felt 
i feel as good as the rest of them look nixon said pointing 
to his fellow presidents 
nixon toured the library wednesday for the first time and was 
asked how he liked it 
what ive seen of it ive been impressed but im not the best 
judge he conceded im going to let these three be the judge 
and jury im glad to be in the hands of this jury 
ford already has a library in michigan reagan will open his in 
simi valley 60 miles to the northwest of nixons next february 
and plans already are under way for one to house bushs papers and 
artifacts 
nixons library is more of a museum since it houses none of 
nixons papers next year if plans are followed the library will 
get nixons archives from his congressional and vice presidential 
days and those that followed his presidency but the real 
presidential papers 42 million pages of documents are in a 
warehouse in alexandria va 
the nixon papers were seized by congress after he left office to 
prevent him from destroying any watergate documents 
millions of pages have been opened for perusal by scholars and 
the library will play tapes of 33 conversations that nixon recorded 
secretly but nearly 4000 hours more of tapes as well as 15000 
important documents have been withheld from the public through 
actions by nixons lawyers 
at thursdays ceremony the wives of the four presidents shared 
the stage pat nixon who has been nearly a recluse for 16 years 
got the loudest applause 
reagan characteristically had a quip about the man who was 
being honored 
much has been written and said about richard nixon said 
reagan some of it has even been true it will come as no 
surprise to anyone here that there will always be a good deal of 
debate about richard nixon

federal telephone regulators are warning 
foreign phone companies that if they dont stop padding charges for 
international calls the united states will take unilateral action 
to lower prices 
the federal communications commission says us phone customers 
may have paid as much as 1 billion too much for international 
calls in 1988 due to outmoded contracts that allow overseas phone 
companies to charge inflated prices for handling the other end of 
international calls 
not only does the practice hurt individual pocketbooks it adds 
greatly to the us trade deficit because far more calls go out of 
the united states than come in 
us phone companies paid out 2 billion more in 1988 than they 
took in from foreign phone companies according to the fcc which 
last thursday threatened to limit what american phone companies can 
pay to overseas carriers 
the fcc says roughly half of the 2 billion deficit represented 
an overpayment by us consumers to foreign telephone companies 
that have refused to keep prices in line with costreducing 
advances in technology such as direct dialing 
the fcc proposed to ease restrictions on how american telephone 
amp telegraph and other us longdistance companies such as mci and 
us sprint negotiate accounting rates with foreign companies 
these accounting rates determine how the two sides divvy up the 
charges consumers pay for international calls 
competition gives us companies an incentive to lower prices 
but foreign phone companies which typically are state owned dont 
face competitive pressures 
their accounting rates may be based on the cost of 
operatorassisted international calling and not reflect the lower 
costs of todays ubiquitous directdialing 
west germany for instance has not lowered its accounting rate 
since 1983 us phone companies still pay half of 156 a minute 
or 78 cents a minute to the germans for completing calls to west 
germany 
atampt and its rivals charge between 620 and 1158 for a 
10minute call from the united states to west germany depending on 
when and how the call is made but a german caller gets hit with a 
flat 1907 for the same call 
if atampt charges 62 cents a minute it loses money it makes up 
such losses however by collecting 78 cents a minute for 
completing calls from west germany to the united states 
but the inflated 156 accounting rate keeps prices high and 
customers foot the bill 
foreign governments argue that the us payments represent 
muchneeded dollars that not only subsidize local phone systems but 
also help pay for schools or imported goods 
thomas luciano deputy director for international settlements at 
atampt said wednesday that 65 percent of the us out payment goes 
to developing countries we recognize we need to be sensitive to 
the concerns of some of the foreign telephone companies were 
dealing with 
but luciano argued that if foreign nations lower their rates 
theyll more than make up the lost revenue in increased volume of 
calling both in and out of their countries lower rates also will 
boost foreign economic development he said 
luciano said atampt which has about 89 percent of the us 
overseas phone market succeeded in lowering international 
accounting rates with more than 70 nations in 1989 but he said he 
welcomed the fccs impetus 
we have already been expressing the deep concerns of the us 
government including the fcc as part of our negotiations 
luciano said 
south korea he said has reduced its accounting rate steadily 
from 236 a minute to 210 a minute and japan dropped its rates 
in 1985 from 235 to 175 a minute sweden has cut its accounting 
rate in half he added

president wojciech jaruzelski once 
polands communist leader and now for many poles the symbol of that 
disgraced regime marked his first anniversary in office thursday 
by saying he was prepared to resign 
jaruzelski in the rare appearance on national television said 
he would not take a position in the public debate on how long he 
should stay in office 
i think it would be better if others made the statements 
said the former communist party leader he assumed his new office 
as president on july 19 1989 
i dont consider myself anointed just performing a service 
for the nation and for the country said 67yearold jaruzelski 
and the moment recognized as proper for a change of the president 
will be treated by me with full understanding 
jaruzelski was elected president for a sixyear term last year 
during a joint meeting of the new freely elected senate and the 
partially democratically elected sejm or lower house 
although the office makes him commanderinchief of the armed 
forces and gives him the power to veto legislation jaruzelski uses 
his prerogatives sparingly 
the more powerful position of prime minister is held by tadeusz 
mazowiecki a former activist in the solidarity labor movement 
solidarity controls the government 
even though jaruzelski was resented for imposing martial law 
against solidarity in 1981 many members of parliament believed he 
could help assure smooth relations with the soviet union and the 
rest of eastern europe polands neighbors were still hardline 
communist as this country pioneered the east blocs transition to 
democracy 
many poles view jaruzelski as an anachronistic vestige of the 
old communist system now that the soviet union has accepted east 
bloc changes and communist rule has ended in neighboring 
czechoslovakia and east germany 
advocates of solidarity leader lech walesa want walesa installed 
as president this fall by parliament 
jaruzelskis two longtime loyalists in the cabinet interior 
minister gen czeslaw kiszczak and defense minister gen florian 
siwicki resigned at mazowieckis request on july 6

chiquita brands international is 
severing talks with a union whose threeweekold strike has 
crippled banana exports to the united states officials of the 
cincinnatibased company said thursday 
honduras president rafael leonardo callejas said the strike 
has caused more than 45 million in economic losses to his central 
american country 
chiquita formerly united fruit accounts for 60 percent of 
honduran banana exports of 50 million boxes a year san 
franciscobased castle amp cooke exports the other 40 percent 
the rigid position of the union has kept talks stalled for the 
past two weeks said chiquitas general manager karl f koch in 
a prepared statement 
the 10000 workers struck june 25 to demand the first increase 
in six years in their pay now averaging 1532 a day they want a 
58 percent increase 
the last offer by chiquita brands was to approve a salary 
raise of 1433 percent which was immediately rejected by the 
union said union president rene ayestas he called the companys 
previous offers humiliating 
for his part koch said the companys original optimism has 
turned to frustration at finding that the union still maintains its 
original position 
president callejas earlier sent a presidential mediation team to 
try to solve the impasse 
i believe we will reach a negotiated end to the strike this 
weekend although the present situation is tense and difficult 
the president said 
the walkout initially was joined by 30000 other workers in the 
health postal and industrial fields but those workers returned to 
their jobs after 10 days

let the children come to me and do not hinder 
them jesus said for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven 
that special blessedness of the young taught in christianity and 
the concern for them expressed in sacred writings of other 
religions are to be shared next week in a special forum 
a variety of religious leaders christians moslems jews 
hindus sikhs shintoists zoroastrians and others are to meet 
july 2527 at princeton theological seminary in new jersey on 
behalf of children around the world 
religious leaders that do not normally come together about 
anything are coming together in the cause of children said 
william p thompson chairman of the conference steering committee 
all the major religions have in their traditions a concern for 
children he said in an interview their plight is getting 
worse in the world today 
thompson associate secretary general of the world conference on 
religion and peace which is sponsoring the meeting in cooperation 
with the united nations childrens fund added when children are 
exploited were sowing the seeds of our own destruction 
in many ways and places thats now happening he said citing 
impoverished conditions in which kids are being pushed out to 
live on the streets and the rising proportion of children among 
the worlds homeless and refugees 
thompson longtime us presbyterian leader said that we want 
to maximize attention of religion leaders to the problem of 
children and bring that thinking to the forefront of public 
awareness 
the threeday meeting involving 100 religious leaders from 40 
countries and representing 10 major religions is expected to adopt 
a declaration for children and an action program for protecting 
their development 
being held as a precursor to the world summit for children 
at the united nations sept 2930 the interreligious meeting seeks 
both to stir concern for children in religious ranks and also 
actions by governments 
defending the rights of children is one of the significant 
ways of working for future peace thompson said noting that 
recent striking changes in eastern europe have meant great 
progress in that cause 
but we still have to work at building sufficient justice for 
peace to last he said including more equitable economic 
conditions and help for the underprivileged 
there are dauntless problems still before us he said 
thompson 71 chief executive of the united presbyterian church 
for 18 years and a member of the governing boards of the nationa 
council of churches and world council of churches fills his 
interreligious peace post without pay 
the sacred writings of all of the great religions commit 
themselves to peace he said 
some people now and in the past have supported wars in the name 
of religion but the teachings of those faiths themselves 
invariably oppose war and advocate peace he said 
to blame religion as the cause of conflict which often is 
done by antireligionists overlooks the facts of the religions 
themselves which in their basic beliefs commit themselves to 
peace thompson said 
secularists think were at each throat he added but he 
maintained such judgments were drawn from deviations from religious 
principles not adherence to them 
however he said there are extremists in every religion who fan 
the flames of conflict who see no truth in any faith but their own 
and who try to maximize their political power to control others 
in doing so such a person may be hypocritical in not stating 
accurately what he knows to be a fact about his religion or he may 
be uninformed about what its religious teachings really are 
thompson said 
in view of human motives to seek power and be prideful he 
said some use religion as a cloak behind which to hide their 
real motives using religious symbols to annimate followers in 
conflicts and gain power 
asked about regional conflicts such as those between roman 
catholics and protestants in ireland moslems and jews in the 
middle east buddhists and hindus in sri lanka or moslems and 
christians in the sudan he said 
these most always are between ethnic groups identified by 
their religions the disputes often are based on ethniceconomic 
differences rather than religious motivation as the names suggest 
in many cases he said the conflicts have complex roots in the 
past involving rivalry over power territories or economic status 
with hostilities extended into the present under religious labels 
thompson a kansasreared lawyer who was a us army captain in 
world war ii and a warcrimes prosecutor said war is connected 
to sin to defections from the principles of all major faiths 
it happens because of errant human nature not fidelity to 
religions he said

a federal judge who was asked to intervene 
in a bitter dispute over chippewa indian gambling in wisconsin has 
ruled that tribes that do not have gaming compacts with the state 
cannot operate casinos 
us district judge barbara crabb on wednesday denied a request 
from two chippewa bands seeking an injunction prohibiting the state 
from closing down reservation casinos that opened in the last year 
mrs crabb ruled such casino operations are and will remain 
illegal until the tribe and state negotiate and enact federally 
required gaming agreements 
but she also declared that the state which threatened to 
prosecute the tribe doesnt have authority to close down the 
operations she said that authority rests with the us attorneys 
office 
jerry maulson gaming manager for the lac du flambeau chippewa 
band that filed the lawsuit said the tribe won its argument that 
the state doesnt have jurisdiction to prosecute gambling issues on 
reservations but lost on the ruling that indian gambling was 
illegal without a gaming compact 
its sort of like a doubleedged sword maulson said 
us attorney patrick j fiedler in madison said he would 
consult with justice department officials before deciding whether 
to close any reservation casinos in wisconsin 
he said previous advice from washington indicated it was more 
sensible to rely on state prosecutors although it was believed 
the state and federal governments had concurrent jurisdiction 
the yearlong dispute in wisconsin began last fall when the 
state and its dozen indian tribes failed to reaching gambling 
regulation pacts by october as required by the us indian gambling 
regulatory act passed by congress in 1988 the government has since 
extended the deadline until next may 
the negotiations broke off late last year and tensions were 
worsened when the states top law official attorney general donald 
hanaway issued an advisory opinion in february that casino 
gambling was illegal in wisconsin 
the opinion led several local prosecutors to warn tribes they 
would raid and close down the several reservation casinos that had 
begun operations in the last year 
most of the tribes closed their reservations voluntarily but 
two bands of chippewas sued asking mrs crabb to stop the state 
from enforcing state gambling laws on the reservations 
mrs crabb denied the request saying the tribes could avoid 
prosecution by the government by not sponsoring casino operations 
until the required gaming compacts are enacted 
the ruling came a day after interior secretary manuel lujan 
announced guidelines that would allow tribes to buy nonreservation 
land to open bingo parlors and other gaming establishments 
under the guidelines such purchases would have to be approved 
by the governor of the state lujan said 
the guidelines also bar tribes from buying outofstate land for 
gambling sites the interior department will seek input from tribes 
before putting the guidelines in effect

a year after they tumbled out of the 
smokechoked fuselage of a shattered jumbo jet into a hot corn 
field survivors of united flight 232 returned thursday to give 
prayers of thanks and sympathy 
a memorial service forced into an airport hangar by heavy 
rains coincided with the moment a year ago when the plane tumbled 
in flames while attempting an emergency landing 
many cried quietly as the rev gregory clapper a united 
methodist minister from le mars led the assembled survivors and 
families of victims in part of the 23rd psalm some survivors 
described feelings of guilt 
when air national guard jets roared off to form a missing 
man formation some clasped hands over ears and held clenched 
fists to their mouths 
its been an emotional roller coaster for all of us but even 
so the remembering has been an important part of the healing 
process said united capt al c haynes who led the crew of the 
dc10 in guiding the plane to the airport where it cartwheeled 
while attempting an emergency landing 
haynes told the crowd of several hundred it was important for 
all involved to deal with the painful memories of the crash 
somehow we must find a way to take them away from our present 
and make them part of the past haynes said 
many survivors said returning to site of the crash helped them 
deal with tragedy 
i wanted my boys to know that sioux city is a place where 
normal things happen that its a place of mending as well as 
catastrophe said brownell bailey of bowmar colo 
baileys wife francie was one of 112 people who died when the 
plane crashed after an engine broke apart severing a hydraulic 
system that controlled the plane there were 296 people aboard the 
july 19 1989 crash 
survivors and their families plus sioux city rescuers were 
allowed to walk around the crash site thursday 
i have a lot of memories of some pretty gruesome things and 
we both feel guilty that we walked away unharmed while so many 
others didnt said sharon bayless who with her husband brad 
of littleton colo escaped with minor injuries 
i knew it would be hard to come back she said 
but her husband said a visit to the airport was important 
i want to see it without bodies and luggage and airplane parts 
strewn all over he said 
the baylesses said one of their first priorities was to thank 
the rescuers 
i suppose its the old midwest cliche but theres a lot to be 
said about the way the people of sioux city pitched in to help im 
not sure that would have happened if this crash occurred somewhere 
else bayless said 
many of the survivors sought out haynes to thank him for the job 
the crew did in guiding the crippled airliner to the airport 
despite survivors thanks and praise haynes insisted there were 
no heroes in the cockpit but he said some people needed to look up 
to the crew as part of their healing 
if we are serving some kind of function by being called 
heroes so be it haynes said id like to think that any other 
welltrained crew would have responded as we did 
roman s popielak a crash survivor also from littleton said he 
returned so i could close the books 
this is not opening wounds for me it depends on your strength 
or makeup i prefer to deal with my problems myself other people 
may need to lean on others and may feel more vulnerable popielak 
said 
adriene badis 41 of durham nc his wife and two children 
survived the crash but they were separated for three hours 
i told my older son eric 7 that his brother and mother had 
died he said when he found them alive i was numb elated 
there are no adjectives 
lori michaelson used the reunion to put pressure on congress to 
require child restraints on airliners currently small children 
are permitted to sit on their parents laps 
ms michaelsons 11monthold daughter sabrina ripped from 
her grasp during the crash was saved by another passenger the 
passenger jerry schemmel of denver heard her cries and pulled her 
from the wreckage 
lets have something positive come out of this crash she 
said 
my actions have been overblown said schemmel who appeared 
with ms michaelson in one of numerous news conferences at briar 
cliff college 
youd be surprised youd do the same thing i didnt run 
through a wall of fire to get her god was looking over us i 
didnt do anything spectacular i just reacted he said

the sunrunner a studentbuilt solar car that 
runs on the power of a hair dryer hummed across the finish 
line thursday to win a floridatodetroit race by 32 sunpowered 
vehicles 
western washington universitys viking xx was first to finish 
but the university of michigans sunrunner had the best elapsed 
time in the 11day 1641mile competition 72 hours 50 minutes 
and 47 seconds its average speed was 225 mph 
this is about as good as engineering can get said michigan 
team member bill kaliardos its an exciting way to display solar 
energy and its applications 
the sunrunner triumphed despite its first mechanical delay a 
10minute stop thursday to repair a drive chain 
western washingtons entry was second in the early unofficial 
standings and the university of marylands pride of maryland came 
in third 
the vehicles completed the final 84mile leg of the race under 
strong sun and with temperatures in the 80s the flat lightweight 
vehicles finished with faint whines and hums rather than the 
booming exhausts and smoking tires of their internalcombustion 
cousins 
the sunrunner just over 3 feet high but 19 feet long and 66 
feet wide and other cars were designed to expose the maximum area 
of solar cells to the sun and run on minimum power in the 
sunrunners case 15 horsepower 
were trying to run the car on the power of a hair dryer 
said susan fancy a 27yearold mechanical engineering student who 
was the sunrunners project manager 
the gm sunrayce usa which began july 9 at disney world in lake 
buena vista fla was sponsored by general motors corp the us 
department of energy and the society of automotive engineers 
gm plans to send the top three finishers to australias world 
solar challenge a 2000mile race across the australian outback 
from darwin to adelaide it starts nov 11 
were going to take our car back and start preparing it to go 
to australia said bill lingenfelter 23 a western washington 
university industrial technology student and the viking xx team 
captain 
lingenfelter said some 35 people worked for about 18 months on 
the viking xx 
one thing that i really like its all studentdesigned and 
studentbuilt said lingenfelter of the car which was featured 
on the cover of popular science last august 
one of only three twopassenger vehicles in the race the 
pontoonlike vehicle had two fishbowlshaped cockpits facing each 
other its very radical lingenfelter said 
gm held a parade of the finishers and another banquet for the 
racers who were treated to a lobster dinner in mason on the eve of 
the final race day 
the star ii from small crowder college in missouri showed that 
small could be beautiful finishing first in wednesdays 190mile 
leg from greenville ohio to mason 
crowder finished fifth overall edging out such engineering 
powerhouses as mit in sixth place and stanford in seventh in 
fourth place was the solar eagle of california state universitylos

bickering prevailed thursday as white house 
officials and congressional leaders spent their first budget 
bargaining session in more than a week fighting over recent 
partisan statements by both sides 
we simply had to kind of yammer at each other said 
negotiator sen bob packwood rore 
the squabbling came as negotiators hit a lull in their efforts 
to find enough tax increases and spending cuts to lop 50 billion 
off next years federal deficit 
last week senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said 
he would demand higher income tax rates for the wealthy if 
president bush continues to seek a capital gains tax reduction 
democrats argue that the rich would be the main beneficiaries of a 
reduction 
wednesday house republicans voted informally to oppose any 
deficitreduction deal that includes tax increases of any kind 
they also accused mitchell of hindering the search for a budget 
deal 
on thursday rep mickey edwards rokla blistered mitchell 
and the democrats again claiming they go to bed at night worried 
that there might be something they havent taxed yet 
but house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif said 
that at thursdays session republican leaders promised to try do 
what democrats have demanded deliver the votes of at least half of 
congress gop lawmakers for whatever budget deal emerges 
they reassured us that provided we reach an agreement theyll 
work to do that panetta said 
participants said no substantive ground was covered as full 
negotiating teams from both sides met for the first time since july 
11 the 2hour session illustrated how politically sensitive a 
task the budget bargainers have 
theres a lot of concern that you cant work what are very 
difficult issues and have grenades thrown in one direction or the 
other said panetta hopefully the summit will get back on 
track 
the negotiators plan to meet again monday and meet with bush 
that evening

prosecuted the official cuban news agency prensa latina and the 
czechoslovak state news agency ctk reported

allowed to go home and no legal proceeding will be started against 
them ctk said 
at least eight other asylumseekers remained on diplomatic 
grounds thursday four in the spanish embassy and four in the 
residence of the italian ambassador who is not in cuba 
small bands of cubans seeking asylum began taking refuge at 
diplomatic missions eight days ago 
prensa latina said thursdays surrender was negotiated with a 
cuban foreign ministry official and a representative of the 
czechoslovak embassy 
hours before they gave up their refuge the asylumseekers vowed 
to stand fast notimex said 
we have decided to stay here at least as long as the food 
holds out one yelled to reporters outside the building notimex 
said quoting unidentified journalists

havana thursday to reinforce security at pragues diplomatic 
missions in cuba spain also reinforced security at its missions in

prince norodom sihanouk on thursday 
criticized a cutback in us support for his guerrilla coalition 
saying that would only make it more firm and fierce in battling 
the cambodian government 
china indicated it would continue its crucial aid to the khmer 
rouge while some of the coalitions other allies in southeast asia 
said they doubted the us shift would promote a peaceful 
settlement 
cambodias government along with its vietnamese backers 
welcomed the us move wednesday to withdraw recognition of the 
resistance coalition and open a dialogue with vietnam on resolving 
the 11yearold civil war 
britain also praised the us decision and said it also opposes 
the cambodian resistance alliance dominated by the fanatical khmer 
rouge having cambodias seat at the united nations 
the us decision reflected fears of a resurgence of the 
communist khmer rouge which killed or starved to death hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians in slave labor camps and in rural villages 
during their 197578 rule vietnam invaded in late 1978 and 
installed the current government 
some analysts say the us move could open the way for 
diplomatic relations between the united states and vietnam 
estranged since the end of the vietnam war in april 1975 
the soviet vice minister of foreign affairs igor rogachev said 
southeast asia could not achieve real stability without normal 
diplomatic ties between the united states and vietnam and cambodia 
for the moment there isnt normalization but we hope there 
soon will be he said in paris 
sihanouk a noncommunist who leads the threeparty resistance 
coalition said the us move was an act of very serious 
injustice 
the coalition now will be more firm and fierce in their 
determination to continue to resist he said in a statement from 
north koreas capital of pyongyang where he lives part of the year 
it will only keep alive a government in cambodia that is a 
creature and creation of vietnam he said 
phnom penhs official spk news agency quoted a foreign ministry 
spokesman welcoming the us shift as paving the way for 
achievement of an early political settlement 
the official vietnam news agency quoted vietnams foreign 
minister nguyen co thach as applauding the us move 
thach said hanoi wanted an early fair and equitable solution 
and is ready to negotiate with concerned countries on the 
cambodia issue 
some guerrilla leaders said the us shift could force them 
closer to china and strengthen the khmer rouge 
prince norodom ranariddh son of sihanouk and commander of his 
army said wednesday that if the united states suspends its 7 
million in annual aid to the noncommunist guerrillas china has 
promised to double that amount 
to cut off the noncommunist resistance you will strengthen 
the khmer rouge he said 
peace talks have foundered the guerrillas reject phnom penhs 
wish to retain power in the period leading to elections 
the guerrillas want to share power or have the united nations 
assume authority sihanouk and the head of the third guerrilla 
group former prime minister son sann have refused phnom penhs 
demand they abandon the khmer rouge 
they say the group would only fight on if excluded from a 
settlement 
in beijing thursday foreign ministry spokesman jin guihua said 
all cambodian factions must be included in any political settlement 
so long as vietnam does not withdraw all its troops from 
cambodia genuinely china will continue to support the cambodian 
people in their resistance against the foreign invaders he told 
a news conference 
thailand also has not indicated it will decrease its sanctuary 
logistical and other support to the guerrillas 
the us shift will not affect the khmer rouge militarily and 
might push them to concentrate on a military solution said a 
thai official involved in the aid program who spoke on condition 
he not be named 
the khmer rouges 30000member army is reported to have struck 
in virtually every province in cambodia attacking five provincial 
capitals in recent weeks

more than 10000 people thursday 
demanded the resignation of president ion iliescu during a 
demonstration in this western city that gave birth to romanias 
anticommunist revolution 
the protesters who equated iliescu with communism also called 
on his government to step down and urged the release of a jailed 
activist 
in a main square of timisoara the demonstrators accused iliescu 
and his government of a new form of totalitarian rule they cheered 
down with communism and down with iliescu 
iliescu a former communist official won free elections in may 
but opponents demanded he step down because of his hardline past 
he has repeatedly said he favors democracy and a freemarket 
economy 
timisoara is the transylvania city where street protests touched 
off a revolution in december against communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu he and his wife elena were executed dec 25 under orders 
of a revolutionary tribunal 
in an open letter to the government the demonstrators thursday 
also urged the release of marian munteanu the leader of a 53day 
roundtheclock opposition rally broken up by police last month 
munteanu was later badly beaten by rampaging miners answering an 
iliescu call for help against antigovernment rioters she was 
arrested on suspicion of involvement in the riots 
earlier thursday iliescu promised university students he would 
contact the prosecutor general about munteanu 
but he told students seeking munteanus release that it is the 
task of justice to take a decision in the case the state rompres 
news agency said 
munteanus detention ignited a mass protest july 13 when 20000 
demonstrators marched in bucharest to demand his release it was 
the largest rally since the december revolution 
the world community harshly criticized iliescu for the miners 
rampage and the united states and other western nations cut off 
all nonhumanitarian aid to romania 
on wednesday premier petre roman told french president francois 
mitterrand that it is possible that marian munteanu will be set 
free roman was visiting france 
the open letter from thursdays demonstrators also asked the 
government to cast light on what happened to securitate 
ceausescus feared secret police as well as the dictators hard 
currency accounts and the funds of the communist party

bad weather hindered rescuers looking for 42 
climbers killed in an avalanche in the pamir mountains in central 
asia tass said thursday it said the toll could mount if the snow 
had engulfed other unregistered groups 
an earthquake last friday set off the avalanche that hit the 
base camp of a sovietswiss expedition at 16000 feet more than 
twothirds up lenin peak 1800 miles southeast of moscow 
about 55 to 60 people were at the camp at the time including 
bulgarian and east german climbers and soviet tourists the soviet 
news agency said 
victims included 23 members of the leningrad climbing team four 
climbers from israel six from czechoslovakia two from switzerland 
and one from spain 
the search which is being conducted despite very cold 
weather the snow storm and gusting winds is very risky tass 
quoted the newspaper sovetsky sport as reporting 
the avalanche sent the climbers who were in the camp at the 
moment of the catastrophe tumbling down into deep fissures and 
covered them with snow it said the earthquake centered in 
afghanistan caused a huge slab of ice to split from a glacier 
which in turn started the colossal avalanche engulfing the 
camp with more than 40 mountaineers 
three climbers were found alive and two of them were 
hospitalized 
konstantin leonov chief of the tadzhik mountaineering rescue 
service told tass the camp has existed for more than 10 years and 
was considered to a considerable extent safe however absolute

the bush administration suppressed a 
government report that offered ways to reduce significantly the 
timber job losses that would result from protection of the rare 
northern spotted owl two northwest lawmakers charged thursday 
reps peter defazio dore and jolene unsoeld dwash gsaid 
the may 1 report was leaked to them by a source in the 
administration 
the white house declined comment a spokesman for interior 
secretary manuel lujan jr said the report was an internal document 
that never was intended for release 
they are just playing partisan politics said the spokesman 
steve goldstein 
the report prepared by the forest service an arm of ther 
agriculture department and the bureau of land management part of 
the interior department outlines ways to save as many as 21000 
timber jobs by among other things adding new restrictions on log 
exports and boosting spending on forest service programs defazio 
said 
he said it was prepared for release at the same time the two 
agencies projected that one controversial plan to save the owl 
would cut timber harvests in the region by nearly 50 percent and 
cost the region more than 28000 jobs by the end of the decade 
each nesting pair of owls needs large areas of undisturbed 
oldgrowth forest to survive the fish and wildlife service last 
month classified the owl as an endangered species which means the 
government must come up with a protection plan 
the bush administration has not drafted complete plans but has 
said it expects 1000 timber jobs in the northwest will be lost 
bush has said he wants to balance the needs of timber communities 
against owl protection 
this report has been suppressed by the administration 
defazio said during a hastily called news conference at his office 
i find it absolutely outrageous that the administration on may 
1 could give on us onehalf of the equation that is they dropped 
on us the job impacts the fear of loss of livelihood that came to 
so many thousands of people in the pacific northwest 
defazio said forest service workers have told him of the report 
and have been urging him to obtain a copy of it for several weeks 
but he said administrators denied it existed 
goldstein declined comment on the allegation that administration 
officials denied the document existed i cant speak to that i 
dont know who they talked to he said

the minnesota supreme court overturned a 
700000 damage award to a man who sued the states two largest 
daily newspapers for revealing his identity after he was promised 
anonymity 
in a 42 decision to be filed friday the states highest court 
said the saint paul pioneer press and the star tribune of 
minneapolis could not be held liable for breaking reporters 
promises of confidentiality to dan cohen in 1982 
the ruling which one attorney called a major victory for 
news organizations upheld a state appeals court panels dismissal 
of cohens claim of fraudulent misrepresentation but reversed that 
courts ruling allowing his breachofcontract claim 
to impose a contract theory on this arrangement puts an 
unwarranted legal rigidity on a special ethical relationship 
precluding necessary consideration of factors underlying that 
ethical relationship associate justice john simonett wrote for 
the majority 
the court also said enforcement of the promise of 
confidentiality under a doctrine that implies a legal contract 
where none exists in fact would violate the newspapers first 
amendment rights 
cohens attorney elliot rothenberg said thursday the case will 
be appealed to the us supreme court 
this case isnt over by a long shot rothenberg said 
its a very important case one with farreaching 
implications he said the issue is to what extent do 
newspapers and the media have a constitutional right to violate 
promises to which everyone else in society would be held liable 
attorneys for the associated press which filed the only 
friendofthecourt brief in the case said cohens trial court 
victory had produced a spate of similar lawsuits around the country 
the latest decision is the first definitive opinion by a 
supreme court of a state directly addressing the issues in 
cohens case and one in which the news media can take 
considerable comfort said attorney dick winfield of the rogers 
and wells law firm in new york the aps general counsel 
louise sommers also of rogers and wells said the ruling was a 
major victory for the news media 
the newspapers and the ap were able to convince the supreme 
court that the first amendment mattered in a case like this where 
a source who had grounds to sue for conventional libel chose to 
mask it as a breachofcontract suit she said 
the case stemmed from a 1982 incident in which cohen gave 
reporters copies of court documents showing that marlene johnson 
then seeking her first term as lieutenant governor had been 
convicted of shoplifting 12 years earlier 
johnsons conviction was vacated in 1971 with no sentence she 
was elected as democratic gov rudy perpichs running mate in 1982 
reelected in 1986 and is running with perpich this year 
cohen who was doing public relations work for 1982 republican 
gubernatorial candidate wheelock whitney provided information 
about johnson on condition he not be identified 
reporters for the newspapers gave him that assurance but 
editors decided to name cohen as their source of the documents 
editors testified that they named cohen because they felt the 
public had a right to know the information came from the whitney 
campaign 
reporters for the ap and wccotv also promised cohen anonymity 
and received the documents the ap published the story and honored 
its promise while the television station did not run the story 
cohen claimed in his lawsuit that he lost his advertising agency 
job after the newspapers breached an oral contract to keep his name 
out of the story 
in rejecting cohens argument that contract law should apply to 
his case the supreme court majority said we are not persuaded 
that in the special milieu of media newsgathering a source and a 
reporter ordinarily believe they are engaged in making a legally 
binding contract 
they are not thinking in terms of offers and acceptances in 
any commercial or business sense the majority said the 
parties understand that the reporters promise of anonymity is 
given as a moral commitment but a moral obligation alone will not 
support a contract 
in addressing whether a promise of confidentiality might 
otherwise be enforceable the court said it had to balance the 
constitutional rights of a free press against the commonlaw 
interest of protecting a promise of anonymity 
of critical significance in this case is the fact that the 
promise of anonymity arises in the classic first amendment context 
of the quintessential public debate in our democratic society 
namely a political source involved in a political campaign the 
court said 
the potentiality for civil damages for promises made in this 
context chills public debate a debate which cohen willingly 
entered albeit hoping to do so on his own terms in this context 
and considering the nature of the political story involved it 
seems to us that the law best leaves the parties here to their 
trust in each other 
in his dissent associate justice lawrence yetka said the result 
of the majority opinion was to carve out yet another special 
privilege in favor of the press that is denied other citizens 
associate justice glenn kelley who joined yetkas dissent said 
the decision serves to inhibit rather than to promote the 
objectives of the first amendment by drying up potential sources 
of information on public matters 
chief justice peter popovich took no part in the decision 
saint paul pioneer press attorney paul hannah said the courts 
majority recognized the difficulties editors and reporters face in 
making decisions about what voters are going to know about the 
candidates and campaigns 
star tribune executive editor joel r kramer said in a statement 
for release friday that the newspaper was especially pleased that 
the court has ruled that the decision to publish true facts 
relating to the activities of a political source in a political 
campaign is one that is protected by the first amendment 
the court following its policy allowed attorneys in the case 
to be contacted thursday but forbade contacts with parties in the 
case until friday

the government said thursday that reporters for 
the asian wall street journal and the far eastern economic review 
would be barred from covering the asiapacific economic conference 
the threeday conference which begins july 29 will discuss the 
economic course of the asiapacific region representatives of the 
united states canada australia new zealand south korea japan 
brunei indonesia malaysia thailand philippines and singapore 
are attending 
the government has been at odds with the journal and the review 
a weekly magazine for several years over alleged interference in 
the domestic politics of this island citystate both are published 
in hong kong by dow jones amp co of the united states 
dow jones in a statement thursday from new york said that for 
reasons that are unclear it appears singapore is extending its 
longasserted right to restrict coverage of singapore for 
singaporean readers and restrict coverage of international 
economic meetings for all asians 
dow jones fears that the governments actions against the 
review and asian journal are therefore entirely coercive or 
punitive the statement said 
in 1987 the government required the journal to reduce its daily 
circulation here to about 500 copies from 5000 the review was 
ordered to cut its circulation to 400500 copies a week from 10000 
but the magazine refused to continue selling in singapore 
the dow jones statement also noted that singapore has given 
reporters for the us edition of the journal and for apdow jones 
permission to attend the conference 
apdow jones is a joint venture of the associated press and dow 
jones 
on wednesday the government introduced a bill in parliament 
that would require foreign newspapers wishing to circulate in 
singapore to get permission annually

neighborhood merchants are cheering but 
advocates for the homeless have cried foul over a newlyenforced 
policy to hose down the sidewalks around new york citys main bus 
station throughout the day 
the policy is aimed at keeping the homeless and their bodily 
wastes off the pavement around the port authority bus terminal 
which has become a magnet for those without shelter 
the sidewalks are being hosed down every couple of hours for 16 
hours starting at 6 am 
i think its the greatest idea in the world and i started 
doing it too said vincent dimino owner of the seabreeze fish 
market on ninth avenue across from the terminal and president of 
the 40th street merchants association 
between the urination and everything else they put out on 
the street we have to keep it clean and thats the only way we 
can dimino said thursday 
but mary brosnahan director of the coalition for the homeless 
said she felt utter frustration because of the policy 
weve shoved them off the platforms weve kicked them off the 
trains and now we are literally flushing them off our sidewalks 
brosnahan said 
i dont know how to get the message across the shell game 
doesnt work 
the summertime policy has been in effect two years but wasnt 
enforced until june 1 because of water restrictions according to a 
port authority spokeswoman lynn tierney 
tierney said the port authority of new york and new jersey has 
been in the forefront of providing social services for the 
homeless over the past 10 years including providing a dropin 
center across the street from the bus terminal 
were in a constant struggle to balance the rights and 
expectations of the 200000 people that commute through this 
facility every day with the needs of the homeless population that 
have made this facility their home she said 
the homeless had to be moved from the sidewalks along with 
their wastes for health and safety reasons she said adding that 
a concrete stairway had to be replaced because of accumulated 
wastes 
weve had situations at times where people had built entire 
towns out of cardboard along the 41st street side of the 
building tierney said 
one problem with the policy has cropped up water was seeping 
into the newly renovated locker room of port authority police but 
caulking will be put in to stop the seepage

sixteen years after urging president 
nixon to resign president bush praised the nations 37th chief 
executive thursday and urged fellow americans to look at richard 
nixon the man 
bush standing with nixon and former presidents reagan and ford 
made only passing reference to the watergate scandal that wrecked 
nixons presidency noting only that it was nixons seventh 
crisis 
nixon who wrote a book called six crises served in 
tumultuous times he said 
bush speaking at the dedication of the nixon presidential 
library and birthplace focused on nixons foreign policy 
achievements and other successes he said richard nixon helped 
change the course not only of america but of the entire world 
he cited nixons trip to china and his peace efforts in the 
middle east and he said who can forget how in moscow richard 
nixon signed the first agreement to limit strategic nuclear arms 
giving new hope to the world for a lasting peace 
bush credited nixon with working for returning power to the 
people with revenue sharing and other programs to shift powers to 
state and local governments he also hailed nixons environmental 
initiatives and his decision to end the military draft 
at the outdoor ceremony in 90degree heat bush said that he 
would say to visitors to the nations 10th presidential library 
due to open on friday look at richard nixon the man 
a beaming nixon said this is the first time ive ever been 
introduced by the president of the united states 
after the dedication the four presidents had lunch together 
the first time that has happened former president carter was 
invited but declined 
bush as chairman of the republican national committee wrote a 
letter to nixon on aug 7 1974 saying his resignation would be 
best for the country 
nixon resigned two days later 
before the library ceremony bush attended a private 
fundraising reception in anaheim calif that was expected to 
raise 300000 for the california republican party 
after the dedication ceremony and lunch at the presidential 
museum bush flew to boise idaho to bolster the senate campaign 
of rep larry craig 
in boise bush called on the democraticled congress to break the 
impasse over budget negotiations 
noting that i did my part by reversing his 1988 no new 
taxes pledge bush told a gop fundraiser for republican senate 
candidate larry craig now its their turn 
i have said ill negotiate without preconditions bush said 
in prepared remarks and i will 
he called the congressional budget process clumsy and 
illogical and at worst cynical and chaotic in short a metaphor 
for whats wrong with washington today 
bushs ties with nixon go back to the early 1960s nixon stumped 
in texas for bush in his unsuccessful race for senate in 1964 and 
also appeared at the kickoff of bushs successful 1966 run for a 
house seat from houston 
nixon passed over bush in picking spiro agnew as his running 
mate in 1968 but in 1970 he tapped the texan as un ambassador 
and three years later recruiting him as republican national 
chairman 
in that office bush finally wrote to the thenpresident it 
is my considered judgment that you should now resign i now 
feel that resignation is best for the country best for this 
president 
bush as president has consulted several times with nixon 
at one point thursday he joked that nixons dog while he was 
vice president checkers was millies role model millie is 
the bush familys pet spaniel

on his famous yellow legal pads and as a man who like his 
favorite author tolstoy admired the dignity of manual labor 
he also praised nixons wife pat as a mirror of americas 
heart and love

the manslaughter conviction of an 
electrician whose faulty work caused a fatal fire has left other 
electricians worried that honest mistakes could lead to criminal 
prosecution 
richard e salz 49 of east haven was convicted june 1 and 
faces sentencing friday in superior court for seconddegree 
manslaughter in the fire death of a 12yearold boy he faces a 
maximum sentence of 10 years in prison 
phil simmons executive director of the park ridge illbased 
international association of electrical contractors said he knew 
of no other case in which an electrician has been charged with 
manslaughter for a death resulting from his work 
the boy burton gorman iii died of smoke inhalation in a dec 
28 1988 house fire caused by a baseboard heating unit that salz 
had improperly installed the month before 
besides failing to get a permit for the work salz ignored the 
manufacturers instructions for installing the heater and committed 
more than a dozen electrical code violations witnesses at his 
trial said 
salz connected the 120volt heater to a 240volt circuit box 
doubling the amount of heat that was supposed to come from the 
heater witnesses said when the unit overheated it ignited the 
wall paneling 
lou acampora president of the connecticut electrical 
contractors association said that while salz had shown a total 
disregard for safety the conviction set a bad precedent 
it puts a lot of good electricians in jeopardy for making a 
mistake said acampora who said the heads of trade groups in 
neighboring new york also had expressed concern about the ruling 
the case also has drawn the attention of electricians in other 
parts of the country said simmons a former chief electrical 
inspector for the state of washington 
i hope it has a sobering effect and that people realize they 
will be held responsible for their actions he said 
authorities involved in the prosecution said the fears of a 
precedent are unfounded they say salz who at one time worked as a 
parttime electrical inspector was charged only because he 
recklessly took actions he should have known would cause a fire 
hazard 
this was not just john q public making an honest mistake 
said lawrence acquarulo an assistant state building inspector who 
testified at salzs jury trial 
salzs license as a contractor was revoked in july 1989 but the 
state electrical work examining board this spring gave him a 
journeymans license allowing him to work under supervision

president bush told civic leaders involved 
in fighting drugs that he thinks the tide is turning in the 
national war against illegal narcotics 
bush spent 45 minutes before a political fundraiser for 
republican senate candidate larry craig in a roundtable discussion 
on drugs with mayor dirk kempthorne and nine others 
there are some signs that create a sense of optimism said 
bush citing surveys that indicate cocaine use is down among high 
school seniors 
i dont want to sound euphoric about it he said but 
were making some headway 
kempthorne told bush boise is not immune from the drug 
scourge we have our tragedy as well as our triumphs 
but he and other local leaders portrayed a city that has the 
police educators drug treatment experts and ordinary citizens 
pulling together 
john southworth 52 a recovered cocaine addict who is now a 
licensed drug abuse counselor told bush his personal tale of 
recovery 
myself i was allowed to manipulate the criminal justice with 
seven duis driving under the influence and received no 
alcoholdrug evaluation no treatment or any education he said 
i ended up going to harder drugs i started up with marijuana and 
ended up freebasing and selling cocaine 
finally he got help and went into recovery 7 years ago 
southworth said 
education doesnt work alone treatment doesnt work alone 
and law enforcement doesnt work alone he said we must fight 
this problem together 
bush appeared intrigued by the mans personal tale and asked if 
he found drugs readily available 
they were for me birds of a feather flock together said 
southworth there was no problem for a coke addict to find coke 
is that supply still as readily available would you reckon 
bush asked 
ive been sober for 7 years and i dont hang out with those 
people anymore southworth said evoking laughter 
but police chief james carvino said you can get drugs if 
youre looking to get drugs carvino also said the federal war on 
drugs has driven drug entrepreneurs to move their business to 
smaller cities 
greg bower the ada county prosecutor praised the work of a 
narcotics task force operating under a 200000 federal grant and 
urged bush to keep up that support 
drug traffickers are afraid of the federal government theyre 
afraid of federal prosecutors and federal mandatory minimum 
sentences bower said 
bush said the war on drugs is not going to be won through 
mandated federal programs but community efforts like the one 
boise is mounting 
kempthorne the mayor assured him that city hall is ready to 
join your white house in the fight 
bush came to idaho after attending the dedication of richard m 
nixons presidential library in yorba linda calif he was leaving 
later thursday for billings mont

a confessed killer who was 
acquitted because of a typing error in a police report will not be 
retried 
palm beach circuit judge marvin mounts on wednesday dismissed a 
firstdegree murder charge against frank mr lucky mars ending 
years of legal wrangling over the case 
in 1983 mars confessed to murdering a friend but was acquitted 
because the time of death listed in a legal document submitted as 
evidence was off by 12 hours 
the document said mars shot willie berry between 5 oclock 
pm january 29 1983 and 1259 am january 30 1983 
the entry should have read 1259 pm 
testimony presented by prosecutors showed that berry could not 
have been killed until after 130 am when he left a party with 
mars to buy cigarettes 
when prosecutors sought to retry the case with corrected 
documents the defense cited doublejeopardy objections and mounts 
agreed 
the case was appealed to the florida supreme court and the 11th 
us circuit court of appeals which in march upheld mounts 
decision 
he dismissed the charge wednesday 
you cant let your personal beliefs make your ruling he 
said the ruling must be based on the law 
mars attorneys hailed the decision as a simple defense of a 
basic constitutional right the double jeopardy clause of the fifth 
amendment provides that a person cannot be tried twice for the same 
offense 
they were seeking to put my client in the electric chair 
said assistant public defender cherry grant im sorry but if 
youre going to kill someone youd better dot all your is and 
cross all your ts 
mars is scheduled for release in 1991 from glades correctional 
institution where he is imprisoned for violating the terms of 
parole on an earlier conviction

caused by vandalism and looting that occurred after last years 
invasion

a us delegation will go to angola this 
weekend to confer with angolas marxist government about stalled 
peace talks with the countrys usarmed rebels and about efforts 
to feed more than a million hungry angolans the state department 
said thursday 
jeffrey davidow the no 2 official in the departments african 
affairs bureau jim woods of the defense department and two other 
officials will travel to luanda on saturday the department said 
despite the urgency of providing food in both government and 
rebelheld territory international relief efforts have been 
stalled by disagreement between the warring sides over supply 
routes 
several international donors have revoked their pledges because 
of backlogs at angolas ports and pilfering of relief supplies 
the international committee of the red cross leading the relief 
project has decided that airlifts are too expensive and is trying 
to arrange safe passage through land corridors for trucks 
the organization estimates 250000 people are in immediate need 
and hundreds of thousands more are in less dire straits 
angolas government wants the food delivered via port namibe on 
its western coast and from there trucked to government and rebel 
areas 
the unita rebels led by us protege jonas savimbi want the 
food delivered through namibia and botswana which border territory 
it controls in southern angola but the angolan government says it 
is worried weapons could be smuggled to the rebels with the food 
the us team will tell the angolans that the administration 
favors multiple routes for the supplies so that as much food as 
possible gets in said a us official who spoke on condition that 
his name not be used 
it will also urge angola to return to peace talks with the 
rebels which broke off last month in portugal and have not 
resumed said the official

the house ethics committee voted without 
dissent thursday to recommend a reprimand of rep barney frank 
dmass for his relationship with male prostitute stephen gobie 
according to sources familiar with the closeddoor deliberations 
the reprimand would be a more severe sanction against frank than 
democrats on the 12member panel had been advocating 
thats what people in the house were sort of expecting would 
happen said one source 
the committee was concerned not only with franks sexual 
relationship to gobie but with actions he took on gobies behalf 
committee members refused to discuss the case and frank refused 
to comment one member rep larry craig ridaho was back in his 
home state for a visit by president bush and it was not known 
whether he had voted by proxy 
the committee hurriedly left its meeting room after more than 
two hours of discussion members all but ignored reporters waiting 
outside 
the committee is adjourned i have no statement said rep 
julian dixon dcalif the committee chairman 
the committee which has been looking into the frank case for 10 
months scheduled no new meetings 
among matters of concern to the committee were the fact that 
frank wrote favorable letters on his congressional letterhead to 
court officials who were supervising gobies probation on several 
felony convictions he also invoked congressional privilege to 
waive parking tickets incurred by gobie while using franks car 
frank said he only sought to have the tickets waived when gobie 
was using the car for official business 
the recommendation would have to be voted on by the house 
reprimand is a relatively new punishment having been used against 
six members since 1976 and simply consists of a vote to accept the 
committee report 
the committee could have recommended the more severe censure 
used before 1976 in which the member must stand before his 
colleagues as a resolution condemning his behavior is read or it 
could have recommended expulsion which no one expected 
first word of the committees decision was broadcast by cbs and 
nbc in their evening news programs 
the house committees action comes a day after its senate 
counterpart recommended that the senate denounce sen dave 
durenberger rminn for financial misconduct and require him to 
pay 124000 to the senate or to charities as restitution 
the case has been one of the most difficult ever considered by 
the ethics panel because what it dealt with was personal behavior 
rather than official duties conservatives on the 12member panel 
have been holding out for a strong punishment which would involve 
a vote by the full house criticizing franks behavior 
when the case first became public late last summer frank 
admitted that he paid gobie 80 for sex in 1985 and then hired him 
as a housekeeper and driver with personal funds 
he said he fired gobie in august 1987 after learning that gobie 
was running a prostitution ring out of franks capitol hill 
apartment 
frank has repeatedly denied gobies allegation that he was aware 
of the prostitution long before he ended the relationship 
in past cases the committee has voted and not released the 
decision for a day or two dixon touched off speculation that the 
panel may have done just that thursday when he said without being 
asked that he would not comment on any votes the committee may or 
may not have taken but neither dixon nor other members would 
discuss the deliberations 
frank in an interview in his office said he had not received 
word from any committee member on thursdays meeting he declined 
to discuss the committee deliberations and said he had no idea when 
the panel planned to meet again 
i have gotten no word official or unofficial frank said 
the committee made up of six democrats and six republicans had 
been deadlocked on the severity of punishment frank should receive 
democrats reportedly wanted to issue a letter of reproval one of 
the mildest sanctions possible because it would not require a vote 
of the full house on franks conduct republican committee members 
had pushed for a tougher sanction 
rep william dannemeyer rcalif has said he would seek a vote 
to expel frank if the ethics committee sought a lesser sanction 
frank a fiveterm liberal democrat representing a group of 
boston suburbs is one of two acknowledged homosexual members of 
the house he is seeking reelection in a race against republican 
john soto who has never held public office and who was soundly 
defeated two years ago in a bid for state representative in his 
home town

canadas minister of indian affairs said 
thursday that the government is ready to buy a land tract claimed 
as ancestral territory by armed mohawks but told the indians they 
must first lay down their weapons 
earlier in the day an indian spokeswoman demanded the federal 
government provide additional guarantees over a parcel of land that 
municipal leaders want to build a golf course addition on before 
the mohawks would put down their arms 
the standoff centers on a 55acre tract in oka a town 18 miles 
west of montreal where the addition is planned a federal purchase 
or expropriation of the disputed land would block the project 
which the indians oppose 
the indians have barricaded themselves at the site for four 
monthsthe confrontation has left one police officer dead and 
prompted an antiindian backlash it was not clear if the officer 
was shot to death on july 11 by fellow police or indians 
at his news conference thursday in ottawa indian affairs 
minister tom siddon said the federal government is prepared to 
pursue the acquisition of that land to settle the mohawk claim 
he said expropriation could be used by the province if necessary 
he added that ottawa recognizes the inadequacy of the mohawk 
land base at oka as a problem to be resolved the mohawks live in a 
centuriesold community there but it has not been recognized by 
the federal government as a bona fide reservation 
siddon insisted however that the process of land acquisition 
is a very long way down the road 
we wont talk while there are barricades and we wont talk in 
circumstances where firearms are used to provoke negotiations 
siddon told reporters 
his remarks threw some cold water on an announcement earlier in 
the day by a provincial official 
at the earlier news conference in montreal quebecs native 
affairs minister john ciaccia said federal officials have 
approved the purchase or expropriation of the tract of forest 
however he made no mention of the federal demand that the indians 
lay down their weapons before any more talks 
in remarks after ciaccias announcement indian negotiator ellen 
gabriel said that before any land deal several earlier mohawk 
conditions to end the armed standoff must be met 
they include allowing the shipment of food water clothing 
bedding and medical supplies to the indians as well as granting 
entry to independent observers from the united nations or amnesty 
international a human rights group 
the mohawk spokeswoman demanded a 48hour grace period to allow 
any mohawks behind barricades to leave without police interference 
there are demands to be met and were ready to continue as 
long as it takes she said 
solicitor general pierre cadieux at the news conference with 
siddon said if youre asking me my personal opinion there 
should not be any amnesty 
in recent days indian leaders and provincial officials have 
been stepping up pressure for the federal government in ottawa to 
intervene in the dispute 
indian groups across canada rallied to the aid of the mohawks on 
thursday 
indians from the grand rapids reserve near lake winnipeg in the 
central province of manitoba set up a blockade closing a main 
highway 
in ontario province ojibway indians slowed traffic on the 
transcanada highway near georgian bay 
since the shootout mohawks at the kahnawake reservation have 
been demonstrating their sympathy by blocking a bridge between 
montreal and its southern suburbs 
local residents have vented their anger at the bridge blockade 
with protests and racist slurs on tuesday the residents broke 
through police barriers there but stopped when confronted by 100 
officers standing shouldertoshoulder no injuries were reported

explosions ripped through a chemical plant 
thursday killing one person injuring as many as 63 others and 
shattering windows in houses and businesses up to a quartermile 
away authorities said 
the two explosions ignited a fire that took 2 hours to contain 
enough so that firefighters could enter the fourstory brick 
building 
the blast sent fireballs 50 feet into the sky a column of 
thick black smoke poured from the building into the surrounding 
residential neighborhood some of the injured were cut by shattered 
glass at a supermarket 
fire chief bill miller said the plant had accounted for all its 
employees he said up to 63 people were injured area hospitals 
said they were treating 56 people four were critically injured 
about 1000 people were evacuated from houses in the neighboring 
incorporated area of norwood for the night while authorities 
checked for structural damage said norwood safety director darryll 
maxwell he said six homes had been declared uninhabitable 
air tests performed by the ohio environmental protection agency 
around the plant found no toxic gases in the smoke miller said 
about 200 people work at the basf corp plant which makes 
linings for cans and coatings for paper cups the building 
contained about 50 chemicals including explosive solvents and 
varnishes workers at the scene said 
volatile and explosive solvents may have leaked from a mixing 
vat and been ignited by a spark said malcolm adcock an assistant 
health commissioner but he stressed this was merely a hypothesis 
kenneth d diedenhofer a basf production manager said the 
company was investigating the possibility of a pressure buildup 
of chemicals in equipment that was being cleaned 
dan delaney who works near the plant said he saw a huge ball 
of fire and smoke out his office window 
shortly thereafter everybody was running down the street out 
of the building to get out sort of in a panic just getting out of 
there as fast as they could delaney said 
police and firemen are all around fighting the blaze he 
said they just keep getting small explosions and more fireballs 
shooting up in the air 
ken kinderman 29 a materials handler at the factory said he 
was walking out of a locker room in an adjacent building when the 
explosion occurred 
i opened the door and when the explosion hit it threw me back 
through the locker room kinderman said he said he had cuts on 
his back and arms but was not seriously injured 
kinderman said the building where the explosion occurred was 
used for handling solvents and varnishes 
i saw the flames shoot from the other building into mine the 
whole back of my building is gone kinderman said 
windows also were shattered at some houses three blocks away 
whalen identified the dead man as lawrence h krechting 58 an 
employee at the plant 
most of the injured including an 8yearold boy sustained 
minor injuries hospital officials said 
four people were in critical condition at the university of 
cincinnati hospital said spokesman david bracey 
diedenhofer said he was in a lab next door when the explosion 
occurred about 215 pm 
it blew out all the windows the whole resin building was 
engulfed in flames diedenhofer said 
i couldnt get in to help anyone i saw one person hanging on 
to the building i was able to get him off 
windows in homes and storefronts as much as a quarter mile from 
the plant were blown out 
the second blast occurred about 250 pm and it was that blast 
that did most of the apparent damage diedenhofer said 
diedenhofer said about 200 people work at the plant which makes 
linings for cans 
dan lawrence a student at summit country day school more than a 
mile from the blast site said he was working at the school when 
the blast shook his building 
lawrence said he thought an earthquake had struck

the international bar association announced 
thursday it has canceled plans to hold its annual convention in 
nairobi kenya because it cannot guarantee delegates safety 
executive director madeleine may said the association was also 
concerned about the state of human rights and the rule of law in 
kenya following civil disturbances this month 
the convention will instead be held in new york city sept 
1923 she said 
safety of delegates is paramount and following three days of 
serious unrest in nairobi and other central areas from 79 july 
1990 which left some 25 dead and many more injured i and my 
fellow officers feel that such safety cannot be guaranteed ms 
may said in a letter to more than 1000 delegates 
everywhere is now peaceful but we cannot be sure this will be 
the case in september 
another matter of great concern to us is the state of human 
rights and the rule of law in kenya a number of persons are 
detained without being charged including four lawyers at least 
one of whom was arrested when he went to a police station to 
interview his client 
the letter continued many hold the view that by proceeding 
with our conference the iba would be lending support to a regime 
that has suppressed those attempting peacefully to express their 
political views and exercise their internationally recognized human 
rights 
the association founded in 1947 and now with more than 13000 
members describes itself as the largest international forum for 
lawyers 
the human rights organization africa watch issued a news release 
in new york its headquarters saying it applauds the decision 
of the association 
africa watch a division of the private human rights watch that 
monitors abuses around the world said the arrest exile and 
harassment of human rights lawyers makes kenya a singularly 
inappropriate venue for a meeting of such an organization as the 
international bar association

spanishlanguage television stations excluded 
from interviews thursday in which vice president dan quayle 
discussed a job bias bill attacked the action as insensitive and 
demanded explanations 
i just dont understand the reason if they dont want to deal 
with the hispanics then thats pretty stupid said angelica 
figueroa news producer at kvda an affiliate of the 
spanishlanguage network telemundo 
the irony of the thing is he was talking here about a 
discrimination bill passed by the senate said kwex news director 
ed barrera whose station is an affiliate of the spanishlanguage 
univision network telemundos competitor 
a spokesman for quayle who in the interviews discussed his 
opposition to a bias bill passed in the senate wednesday night 
said no station was intentionally left out 
affiliates of abc cbs and nbc were invited to interview quayle 
at a san antonio hotel thursday morning after he spoke with 
newspaper and radio reporters 
two cameras were allowed to tape the interview and were asked to 
share the videotape with others who were present said reporters 
who attended a reporter from the mexican network eco also was 
allowed in after protesting his exclusion reporters said 
barrera said his station had asked before quayles visit about 
covering the event and was not told of the thursday interviews he 
later learned there was a press pool only for the three 
englishlanguage networks and called quayles press office to 
complain 
some guy said thats the way we do it and that was it 
barrera said i think its discrimination 
a quayle spokesman who spoke on condition he not be identified 
said the interview was not open to all news organizations and that 
a limited number of local stations routinely are invited to 
interview quayle when he travels 
ms figueroa said she wouldnt call the action discrimination 
but said it was very insensitive especially in a city of 1 
million people where more than 50 percent are hispanic 
if theyre trying to pick up the vice presidents image it 
was a very dumb thing to do she said 
she and barrera said that even though quayle doesnt answer 
questions in spanish they wanted videotape of him and to be in on 
the interviews 
quayles spokesman said that when kwex asked about press 
coverage of quayle the station was told only the vice presidents 
arrival and departure would be open to all news media he said kwex 
covered quayles arrival and was invited to cover the vice 
presidents motorcade 
the bottom line here is somebodys trying to make something 
out of nothing he said we cant include everybody 
texas republican pary chairman fred meyer said barrera called 
him to complain meyer then called quayles office 
we as a republican party are interested in all the media 
meyer said im sure that the vice president would not want to 
overlook these kinds of things and none of us as republicans do

a report that a police officer tortured a 
drug suspect with a hot iron during questioning has prompted calls 
from the naacp and other community groups thursday for the police 
chief to resign 
the groups urged the us justice department to investigate the 
incident which is already being investigated by the police 
departments internal affairs bureau 
the dayton daily news citing police investigative records 
reported wednesday that officer john gamble last january used the 
iron to scorch david greer three or four times while another 
officer pinned greer faceup to a mattress 
gamble kept asking the 18yearold a question until greer told 
him what he wanted to know after gamble threatened to burn his 
genitals the newspaper said 
greer later pleaded guilty to aggravated drug trafficking and 
was sentenced to three to 15 years in prison 
both greer and gamble are black 
gamble denied burning greer until two other officers 
acknowledged june 7 that it had taken place the daily news said 
gamble made a taperecorded statement to police july 6 
i did it the newspaper quoted gamble as saying im not 
proud of it it happened theres nothing i can do about it now i 
wish it didnt but it did and its time for me to deal with it 
montgomery county prosecutor lee falke announced he had 
appointed a special prosecutor to determine whether criminal 
charges were warranted 
the daily news story triggered calls thursday for the 
resignation of police chief james newby by local chapters of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people the 
southern christian leadership conference and the urban league as 
well as the interdenominational ministerial alliance 
we are outraged and disappointed but not surprised at this 
latest incident of police brutality and the subsequent attempt to 
cover up this brutal act said naacp chapter president jessie 
gooding this highlights the pattern of ongoing police brutality 
and injustice in the dayton police department 
the rev william t head an investigator for the naacp said 
newby is responsible for his officers actions 
finally the community has knowledge that the police are not 
above lying and are not above committing illegal acts said head 
its time for chief newby to step aside 
head who has led efforts to investigate other alleged instances 
of police brutality said the officers race was irrelevant 
hes a policeman head said hes wrong 
newby declined to comment on the call for his resignation 
there was no coverup he said pointing out that the 
investigation was initiated by the police department and that the 
information reported by the newspaper was uncovered by police 
investigators 
newby said that when he first learned of the allegations his 
reaction was somewhere between being sick to my stomach and 
disgust he said he expects to announce some disciplinary action 
friday 
county prosecutor falke said prosecutors first became aware of 
the allegations against gamble last march but were skeptical and 
decided to wait until the police department completed its 
investigation 
my assistant just couldnt believe it falke said

former president daniel ortega said 
thursday the fight wasnt over and more unrest could result if the 
conservative government doesnt stick to accords reached last week 
after a violent sandinista strike 
ortega spoke at a rally celebrating the 11th anniversary of the 
popular insurrection that ended the 45year somoza family 
dictatorship 
the struggle had not concluded he told thousands of people 
at a plaza 
we were able to defend that conquest of the revolution but 
the struggle has not ended with the accord between the 
government and the workers or with those who have extremist 
positions who want to disavow the accords 
ortega was refering to the firing of more than 100 managua 
municipal workers after the strike ended july 11 
broad concessions won by the the strikers included a promise by 
the government of president violeta barrios de chamorro not to fire 
those taking part in the walkout 
clashes during the strike between heavily armed sandinistas and 
government supporters killed at least six people and wounded more 
than 100 
ortega warned government officials to proceed with caution 
because they are provoking more conflicts 
now we have to defend democracy against those who want to 
return to somocism he said adding that extremists within the 
government want to see our heads rolls but if any heads roll it 
will be theirs 
the chamorro government which ended a decade of sandinista rule 
april 25 declared thursday a national holiday but did not hold 
public celebrations 
mrs chamorro accused the sandinistas of trying to restore a 
dictatorship she said in a televised speech wednesday night that 
all nicaraguans had supported the revolution of july 19 1979 
because we all believed that we were breaking the gate of a 
tyranny to enter the promised land of democracy and freedom 
unfortunately the revolution was confiscated by an exclusive 
party with a totalitarian ideology it had kept hidden instead of 
democracy dictatorship rose again like a cadaver 
sandinista supporters shooting machine guns and other weapons 
into the air cruised managua streets at dawn thursday to kick off 
the festivities and shouted the newest sandinista slogan the 
revolution continues not one step back 
in an apparent attempt to draw people away from the sandinista 
rally nicaraguas only tv station governmentrun channel 6 
scheduled backtoback movies all day including batman the 
fly and crocodile dundee 
but neither movies nor rain kept away the crowds estimated by 
reporters at about 40000 half the attendance projected by 
sandinista officials 
last years july 19th sandinista rally drew about 100000 
people but many were government workers compelled to attend or 
risk losing their job 
mrs chamorro said bad nicaraguans want this july 19 not 
to signify democracy but military dictatorship again and asked 
the people to support her 
i want to teach those who only know violence the benefits of 
respecting legal rights and of brotherly love 
managua residents awakened to the sounds of fire from machine 
guns pistols and ak47s in nearly every neighborhood 
the noise smacked of the day 11 years ago when sandinista 
leaders and others who fought dictator anastasio somoza rode 
triumphant into managua to celebrate the secret flight two days 
earlier of the last of the somozas 
chamorro supporters say the president should have taken a 
tougher stance with the strikers and mrs chamorro alluded to that 
in her speech 
it is difficult to educate those who have been fanaticized by 
violence and terror she said we carry an inheritance of 
barbarian aggression that almost destroyed managua in a few hours 
but we must prove to them the value of peace and the 
wellbeing that freedom brings and the greatness we can achieve 
working together as brothers 
mrs chamorro was on the original fivemember sandinista junta 
she is the most prominent of those nicaraguans who backed the 
sandinistas in their early years but became disenchanted

presidents richard von weizsaecker of 
west germany and vaclav havel of czechoslovakia will meet kurt 
waldheim july 26 ending four years of nearisolation for austrias 
head of state officials said wednesday 
waldheim has been barred from entering the united states and 
largely shunned by world diplomats for concealing his wartime 
service in yugoslavia and greece as an intelligence officer with 
the invading army of nazi germany 
the czechoslovak charter 77 human rights movement which was 
instrumental in strengthening the opposition and toppling communist 
rule in czechoslovakia last year called on havel to cancel his 
visit to austria and avoid meeting waldheim the czechoslovak state 
news agency ctk reported 
in an open letter addressed to havel charter 77 representatives 
said that by snubbing waldheim the international community voted 
for truth and ethics ie for those political principles on which 
vaclav havel based his mandate 
the letter asked havel a cofounder of the dissident movement 
established in 1977 to publish the reasons that led him to make 
such a serious step or to reconsider his visit ctk said 
president georgios vassiliou of cyprus met waldheim in early 
july the only western head of state up to now to officially visit 
the austrian president 
weizsaecker and havel will see waldheim the former 
secretarygeneral of the united nations at the opening of the 
annual salzburg festival waldheim spokesman kurt skalnik said 
havels arrival had been in doubt the prague daily lidove 
noviny said wednesday that havel would not make the trip but ctk 
quoted havels press spokesman as saying the president would visit 
salzburg on the agreed date 
in a report issued in february 1987 a world commission of 
historians did not find that waldheim was implicated in world war 
ii crimes but said he must have known about wartime atrocities 
committed by his unit 
waldheim denies any wrongdoing he says charges directed against 
him by the world jewish congress and other international critics 
were aimed at keeping him from being elected president and after 
that failed at forcing him to resign

the 66 billion seabrook nuclear power 
plant went to full power thursday for the first time in the 22year 
history of the project a major battleground in the fight over 
nuclear power 
the reactor reached 1150 megawatts enough power for 1 million 
homes at 952 pm according to plant spokesman ron sher 
reaching full power fulfills the dream we have all worked so 
hard to achieve said edward brown president of new hampshire 
yankee the plants operator 
for plant opponents the milestone was the latest in a rapid 
series of disappointments since the decadelate plant received its 
commercial operating license in march from the nuclear regulatory 
commission 
what theyre doing now is another step in the long process of 
the abuse of power said roy morrison spokesman for the 
antinuclear clamshell alliance its a complete disregard of the 
public safety the plant is unsafe its operating in a place where 
there is no evacuation possible 
the group will distribute leaflets at nearby hampton beach on 
sunday but no other protests were planned said another clamshell 
spokesman sam miller 
more than 3200 people have been arrested in antiseabrook 
protests that began even before ground was broken for the project 
in 1976 
hampton beach a focus for seabrook foes who argue there is no 
way to safely evacuate the area was crowded with beachgoers 
thursday as temperatures climbed into the 90s 
tom mcdermott 28 of lowell mass said he felt plant 
operators had everything pretty much under control or they 
wouldnt be going up to full power i guess im just relying on 
them to take care of it to let us know if somethings wrong 
gloria flanders is a hampton beach regular from amesbury one of 
six massachusetts towns within seabrooks 10mile emergency zone 
she said she comes to the shore on weekdays but will avoid it on 
weekends when crowds are bigger 
a lot of people are paranoid she said im not paranoid 
im just uncomfortable 
cliff moss coowner of the new yorker bed amp breakfast is 
neither an inspector at niagara mohawks nuclear plant in oswego 
ny for six years moss said he has confidence in seabrooks 
safety systems 
so does jack obrien whose gas station is practically in the 
plants back yard 
seabrook has been scrutinized under the biggest microscopes 
for years he said full power shouldve happened eight years 
ago 
public service co shelved a nuclear plant proposal in 1969 but 
three years later proposed seabrook as a twinreactor plant with a 
cost of less than 1 billion construction delays and cost 
increases forced owners to scrap seabrook 2 in the mid1980s and 
pushed lead owner public service into bankruptcy reorganization in 
1988 
as new hampshires governor during the 1980s white house chief 
of staff john sununu played a major role in keeping the project 
alive 
under the plants emergency plans a summertime peak population 
of 247000 would be moved out of the 10mile emergency zone in an 
accident 
critics say thats impossible without an unacceptably high risk 
of exposure to radiation plant supporters and the nrc disagree 
one of the chief opponents is massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis massachusetts has refused to take part in emergency 
planning for its six communities in the emergency zone two of the 
17 new hampshire communities involved kensington and rye also are 
not participating

president roh taewoo called on friday 
for an end to cold war on the korean peninsula and proposed 
unrestricted travel between communist north korea and south korea 
the time has come to end total division roh said in a major 
nationwide radio and television broadcast korea must not remain 
the worlds only land still partitioned by cold war politics 
there was no immediate reaction from north korea acceptance by 
north korea would open the peninsula for the first time since 1945 
and set the stage for national unification 
roh noted in the speech that president kim il sung of north 
korea proposed conditional free travel on jan 1 and said i am 
convinced there will be no obstacle 
roh said south korea would open its border at panmunjom in the 
demilitarized zone for five days as of aug 13 and accept 
breathren from the north without restrictions 
roh said north koreans would be allowed to freely visit any 
place in the south and meet anyone they want he challenged north 
korea to offer the same provisions to south koreans 
he said that in the near future foreigners would be 
permitted to freely travel across the border a move which might 
allow tourists and could be expected to speed up the easing of 
tensions between the koreas 
a tide of openness and reconciliation has torn away the iron 
curtain separating the east and the west and is now shaping a new 
world in which nations are cooperating with each other regardless 
of differences in ideology and political systems he said 
even if north korea cannot agree to mutual exchanges at this 
time for some unavoidable reason we will onesidely open our 
society competely roh declared 
south koreans reacted by welcoming the presidents announcement 
but many doubted totalitarian north korea one of the last 
remaining closed societies would allow its citizens to visit the 
south 
the united national movement for democracy south koreas 
largest dissident group called the border proposal a step 
forward it also demanded the immediate release of political 
prisoners in south korea including a student and pastor jailed for 
travel to north korea 
rohs cabinet will meet saturday to review proceedures for 
allowing travel to take place south korean law now makes it a 
violation of national security to visit north korea without 
government permission which has been rarely given 
the korean peninsula was divided into communist north and 
capitalist south in 1945 at the end of world war ii the two fought 
a bitter threeyear civil and ideological war in the early 1950s 
and have remained hostile 
the fact that compatriots in the south and north are still 
unable to visit each other is a shame on us who are a proud people 
with a rich cultural heritage that has evolved over many 
millenniums such a state of affairs should not continue any 
longer he said 
both north and south korea have talked about free travel but 
have never negotiated it the border has remained tightly closed to 
virtually all travel mail and telephone communication for more 
than four decades 
two weeks ago north korea announced it would open a portion of 
its border for restricted passage within a small border area 
beginning aug 15 
the korean peninsula was freed from 35 years of japanese 
colonial rule on aug 15 1945 and the day is historically 
symbolic to both koreas 
the proposal by both koreas calls for the border to be opened at 
panmunjom the truce village in the demilitarized zone that divides 
the peninsula in half panmunjom about 35 miles north of seoul is 
the site of periodic northsouth talks 
panmunjom is inaccessible to the average korean citizen from 
either side the border between the koreas is the most heavily 
fortified in the world with more than 1 million armed soldiers 
behind concrete bunkers and barbed wire 
the southern half of the panmunjom area is guarded by the 
usled united nations command the command has said that it would 
honor the wishes of the koreans regarding a border opening 
in 1985 the koreas exchanged 151 citizens from both sides for a 
fourday family exchange but the visits were limited to the 
capitals of the two nations 
the two koreas are to sign an agreement july 26 setting a date 
for their first prime ministers talks expected to be held in seoul 
in september 
consider how magnificent and great an age the 21st century 
could be for our people if only the country is unified and the 70 
million korans become one again the president said 
south korea has about 43 million residents while north korea 
has a population of about 22 million people

veterans of the dunkirk evacuation in 
world war ii marked its 50th anniversary on wednesday with a parade 
before queen elizabeth ii but the heat took its toll 
one woman fainted while sitting in the reviewing stand near the 
queen and was taken away by stretcher the parade was held in the 
garrison town of aldershot 35 miles southwest of london 
firstaid was given to about 25 people affected by the 88degree 
temperatures 
some of them thought they were back in the desert again 
said maj gen john carpenter chairman of the dunkirk veterans 
association 
some of those on parade also fought in the desert campaign in 
which british and us armies drove german and italian forces from 
north africa 
to all of you the country owes a great debt of gratitude 
the queen told the 2000 parading veterans some in wheelchairs 
pushed by young paratroopers 
the main anniversary celebrations were held in late may 
climaxing with a ragtag flotilla of 50 vessels making their way 
across the english channel from the french port of dunkirk to 
ramsgate england 
over 10 days in may and june 1940 british dutch french and 
belgian warships and civilian craft evacuated 338000 british 
french and belgian troops from dunkirk which was surrounded after 
the germans broke through across northern france 
those saved amid the bombs and gunfire helped form the nucleus 
of the victorious allied armies which invaded normandy in june 1944 
for morale purposes prime minister sir winston churchill 
ordered the dunkirk defeat to be announced as a deliverance and it 
has since been regarded in britain as something of a miracle 
the queen and her husband prince philip later met some veterans 
after the parade 
what are you all standing around here for the bars open 
said philip gesturing toward a drinks tent

twentythree gray whales that washed up on the 
trinity islands in the gulf of alaska recently probably died of 
natural causes federal officials said 
the national marine fisheries service decision against taking 
tissue samples for tests drew fire from some environmentalists 
critics said the endangered mammals should be tested to see if they 
ingested oil from the exxon valdez oil spill in nearby prince 
william sound 
we have no reason to think at this point that its anything 
other than natural mortality steve zimmerman of the fisheries 
service said tuesday from juneau 
he noted the whales had migrated several thousand miles from 
their feeding area in the bering sea to the mexican coast last 
fall then returned 
any that are physiologically weak are going to have problems 
toward the end of that long migration he said 
he said the number of fatalities was high but the whales could 
have died of old age parasites genetic defects marginal feeding 
and exhaustion among other possibilities 
environmentalists have expressed concern because gray whales 
feed on the oceans bottom where weathered oil would sink and 
accumulate in sediments 
grays are the first ones to get nailed if there are tar balls 
on the bottom said cindy lowry alaska director of greenpeace 
im going to encourage them to take not only tissue samples 
but stomach samples as well this is an endangered species they 
should be taking it seriously thats too many whales dying in the 
same place 
biologists from the fisheries service and the university of 
alaska fairbanks examined 14 of the whales sunday and monday on 
tugidak island about 350 miles south of anchorage 
of the 14 whales on tugidak one apparently was the victim of a 
killer whale they said two apparently had been dead since last 
year and one of the 14 was a calf or yearling

a university professor who questioned the 
existence of nazi gas chambers in a magazine article lost a 
disciplinary hearing wednesday and was suspended from his job for 
one year 
bernard notin will draw only halfsalary during his suspension 
as an economics and law instructor at jean moulin universitylyon 
iii the universitys disciplinary committee ruled 
notin is a leading member of jeanmarie le pens farright 
national front party which favors expelling immigrants from 
france le pen once called the holocaust a detail of history 
this punishment for my ideas that theyve purposely turned 
into caricatures while forgetting about my years of teaching and 
research can only leave a bitter taste in the mouths of free 
men notin said following the committees ruling 
he then asked his fellow citizens to show tolerance toward him 
the decision comes a week after an antiracism group won an 
award of 20000 francs or 3623 as damages against notin in a 
civil complaint based on the same magazine piece 
the article notin wrote for the review economy and society in 
january created a national uproar that led to a clash between the 
university and mayor michel noir who is bitterly opposed to the 
national front 
the mayor threatened to cancel the citys plans to donate a 
building to the university named for a leader of the resistance 
unless notin was fired 
the university initially said notins opinions were protected by 
academic freedom but eventually set in course the process leading 
to the disciplinary hearing 
the mayor of lyon has already given the verdict in advance 
notin said as the hearing began tuesday he has the money he 
buys universities i dont have anything to stand up to that 
notins lawyer gilbert collard said he would appeal the 
verdict and ask that a new hearing be held outside lyon 
notins article said that visiting concentration camps is a 
hardly credible way to prove the gas chambers existed and 
described accounts by holocaust survivors as hearsay 
it outraged jewish leaders students and holocaust survivors in 
march 60 people took over notins classroom and conducted a lesson 
on hitlers extermination program 
fears of an outbreak of antisemitism peaked in may after the 
desecration of a jewish cemetery at carpentras where a recently 
buried corpse was dug up 
no one has accused notin of spreading his ideas in the 
classroom but the article was signed by notin and listed his title 
as a professor at the university 
though his suspension will last only one year university 
faculty members say privately it is unlikely notin will be allowed 
to return under french law it is a crime punishable by fine to 
claim that the holocaust never existed

it should tighten the standard for safe levels of lead in blood 
new research shows that even low levels of lead in the blood 
contribute to childhood learning disabilities and high school

currently the cdcs standard calls for medical intervention and 
environmental controls when someones blood contains 25 or more 
micrograms per deciliter 
the committee recommended continuing the standard for medical

moscows decision to drop its objection to 
nato membership for a reunited germany likely will put eastwest 
arms control negotiations back on track administration officials 
and private arms control experts say 
defense secretary dick cheney told reporters wednesday that 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs concession on german 
participation in the north atlantic treaty organization removed 
the last roadblock to clinching two landmark arms control 
agreements 
cheney referred to 23nation negotiations to sharply reduce the 
number of conventional arms tanks troops and aircraft in 
europe and to ussoviet talks on slashing strategic or 
longrange nuclear missiles by onethird 
the conventional arms negotiations have been bogged down for 
months by several key disputes including nato resistance to a 
soviet demand that the west german government of chancellor helmut 
kohl accept a numerical limit on its armed forces 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
if you were to telephone west german 
chancellor helmut kohl as president bush did the other day it 
would cost between 620 and 1158 for 10 minutes depending on 
how and when you called 
but if someone called you from west germany it would cost them 
1907 for the same call regardless of how or when 
that may sound as though youre getting a good deal but you 
arent 
the federal communications commission says that due to outmoded 
international telephone pricing agreements between us companies 
and their overseas counterparts you may be paying twice what it 
actually costs to place such calls

billy ray the dude schoolteacher is reading to 
his class from a penny dreadful about the old west kid durango 
the dust devils the kid of course is brave strong and quick 
with a gun 
one of his students the fair nettie sighs at the part about a 
terrible band of outlaws from mexico just then such a band 
gallops into her dusty texas town for purposes of robbing a bank 
and killing people 
the fair nettie dashes outside to see all this el diablo the 
gangs handsome ruthless leader rides up and kidnaps her even 
though shes only oh maybe 17 billy ray although from boston 
vows to rescue her 
this buckaroos starts home box offices el diablo a 
shaggy western tale arriving sunday on the paycable service 
it costars anthony edwards as the dude schoolteacher who 
believes the old west cliches and lou gossett as an exsergeant 
from the armys black cavalry the latter now is a gunfighter hired 
to help save nettie 
representing old west reality he sort of instructs the dude in 
how ride a horse he lets the horse drag billy ray when he falls 
off and how to shoot and hit something such as another man with 
a gun 
gunnery protocol he says includes looking at an opponents gun 
hand not his eyes and shooting opponents in the back whenever 
possible 
with a script by a trio that includes john carpenter of 
halloween and the fog fame such assault on western 
verities should be pretty funny well at times the script is 
its early moments include an old codger who smiles at billy ray 
and the fair nettie sarah trigger as they head to school then 
cheerily says beautiful mornin for procreation 
there also is a scruffy townie who after el diablo rides off 
with fair nettie recalls seeing him hanged once but he wouldnt 
die he just hanged there by his neck spittin at the crowd like 
they disgusted him 
there is a lot to be said for such lines likewise the lowlife 
posse gunfighter gossett digs up a man with a store leg an 
indian with whose wife el diablo has consorted and a preacher who 
holds fake hangings with two colleagues in return for donations 
all have varied motives for joining the chase theyre later 
joined by truman feathers joe pantoliano a dusty but prissy 
british author of the kid durango series 
upon meeting billy ray now clad in gun and wooly chaps the 
writer is moved to say i love your outfit 
problem is the el diablo script is in dire need of editing 
when the funny lines and situations arise and there are quite a 
few the authors stretch things out this tends to fritter away the 
funny 
they also dont seem to realize that shock for comic effect 
should be sparingly used as when the dude accidentally shoots and 
kills his horse while trying to ride out of town sure enough it 
happens again later 
and while the show is beautifully photographed director peter 
markle usually moves things along at a snails pace a mortal sin 
for an old west show 
the pace does pick up as the posse approaches and enters mexico 
where el diablo is keeping both his stolen gold and the fair nettie 
in a town ringed by mountains guns go off and bodies fall all over 
the place 
but even with the preceding moments of doom it takes a while 
for the show to get moving markle tends to make the proceedings 
going downright leisurely almost an artfilm edition of blazing 
saddles minus the fine beandinner scene and its ensuing blasts 
of hot air 
still el diablo whose title cad is played by robert 
beltran has some good performances by gossett and andrews the 
supporting players also do fine work particularly pantoliano 
if you have hbo the movie is worth a looksee flaws and all 
but it could and should have been a whole lot funnier

the biggest companies seem to make the biggest 
news in the stock market and for obvious reasons they and their 
products are known to the public and their stocks make up the 
popular averages and indices 
but the biggest companies are not a proxy for the economy as a 
whole as a number of smallbusiness and mediumsize business 
groups feel compelled to point out from time to time 
what happens to the biggest names in corporate america can be 
and often is at variance with what is happening in the rest of the 
economy and evidence of that is contained in the latest dividend 
actions 
many of the biggest companies have been raising dividends the 
smaller companies have tended to stay put with relatively few of 
them taking positive action such as resuming dividends raising 
them and adding extras 
observe the contrast 
in the first half of 1990 cash dividends paid by companies 
making up the standard amp poors 500stock index rose 12 percent 
for the 12 months through june the same companies paid out 56 
percent of profits as dividends 
that latter figure say researchers at wright investors 
service compares with just 49 percent for the past decade and 51 
percent for the period 19501989 
figures of that sort suggest a high level of management 
confidence among the larger companies since companies looking for 
a downturn arent likely to commit themselves to larger payouts 
now enlarge the measurement to 10000 companies among these 
companies which make up the entire sampp universe only 868 took 
positive dividend action in the first six months of the year down 
25 percent from a year earlier 
says wright this is the lowest number of positive dividend 
actions in the first half of any year since 1971 a fact which 
illustrates corporate managements lack of confidence regarding the 
nearterm profit outlook 
the contrast with the bigger companies becomes even sharper on 
further examination 
according to wright the total of 187 dividend cuts and 
omissions in the first half of the year was more than 70 percent 
higher than in the first half of 1989 and the highest sixmonth 
total of unfavorable actions since 1983 
other studies have shown similar disparities between the 
performance and expectations of smaller and larger companies 
in contrast to a longterm trend for example the performance 
of smallcompany stocks has lagged behind that of bigger companies 
since 1983 casting much doubt about the veracity of the socalled 
smallstock effect 
smallcompany stocks according to that theory have a tendency 
to outperform larger companies one factor being that good small 
companies have the ability to grow at a faster rate than 
ponderously large operations 
other factors enter the picture as well smallcompany stocks 
are often run by the original entrepreneur who understands the 
company and demands nothing but the best and unexamined by 
analysts smallcompany stocks are more likely to be undervalued 
their prices exploding when they are finally discovered 
in recent months some analysts say they are seeing signs of a 
recovery by the smaller stocks but if dividend actions are an 
indicator similar signs are hardly evident among the larger stocks 
the dividend yield on the sampp 500 stock index recently was 33 
percent or well below its longterm average yield of 42 percent 
such figures suggest that bigcompany stocks might be overpriced

kuwaitis are debating how to pursue democracy four 
years after the ruling family closed the westernstyle parliament 
and press 
some feel the choice for the emirate where oil provides one of 
the worlds highest per capita incomes is between reviving the old 
system and developing an islamic brand of democracy 
the government and dissidents have traded accusations of blame 
for setbacks to the democratic institutions but dissident leader 
ahmed alsaadoun said our loyalty to our leader the emir is 
undiminished by our unrelenting struggle for democracy 
security authorities have tried to cast an undue tinge of 
rebellion on our movement saadoun speaker of the dissolved 
parliament said in an interview riot police ruthlessly 
dispersed peaceful rallies closed our diwaniyas and arrested 
parliament deputies 
diwaniyas are informal gatherings at the homes prominent 
citizens to discuss current issues the government declared the 
diwaniyas of former deputies illegal at one point and ordered them 
closed 
dissidents and witnesses said police used clubs and tear gas to 
disperse prodemocracy demonstrators they said some members of the 
former parliament were beaten up and 15 were arrested 
the respected institution of diwaniya has been badly abused 
sheik salem alsabah the interior minister told reporters the 
diwaniya became a platform of diatribe and antigovernment 
agitation we had to put an end to that 
about 30 of the 50 former deputies under saadoun lead a 
prodemocracy movement that has broad support among wealthy 
merchants in the persian gulf emirate 
native kuwaitis are the largest minority in our own country 
and with the population structure being infested with all kinds of 
hostile and begrudging elements we desperately need national unity 
today more than ever before said mohammed alqadiri a close 
aide of saadoun 
fewer than 40 percent of the emirates 18 million people are 
kuwaitis about 30 percent of the residents are shiite moslems 
some of whom sympathize with the islamic revolution in nearby iran 
kuwait once had the arab worlds only free press and freely 
elected parliament both of which were eyed with suspicion by 
neighboring saudi arabia and other conservative regimes in the gulf 
region 
when the iraniraq war began in 1980 the government decided 
democracy was a luxury no persian gulf nation could afford 
proiranian shiites spread terror in kuwait with bombings and made 
a daring attempt to kill the emir 
relations between kuwait and iran have improved since a 
ceasefire halted the war in 1988 and foreign minister ali akbar 
velayati of iran visited recently 
several times during the war the press and parliament 
embarrassed the government with accusations of corruption and open 
debates of subversion and foreign policy 
criticism of the government became increasingly harsh after the 
unofficial souk almanakh stock market collapsed in 1982 the press 
also blamed the government for the crash which was worthless 
postdated checks totaling 97 billion 
deputies claimed the government had allowed influential people 
close to the ruling sabah family to borrow speculation money from 
banks without collateral 
that prompted the emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah to 
suspend the national assembly in 1986 and censor the press 
the emir acted on his constitutional authority when he 
dissolved parliament but the constitutional stipulation that 
elections for a new parliament be held within 60 days was 
ignored saadoun said 
on july 9 sheik jaber ordered the detainees freed and 
introduced a transitional legislature dissidents rejected as 
unconstitutional jaber said the 75member national council would 
pave the way for a parliament within four years 
he ordered the council of 50 elected and 25 appointed members to 
create controls to avert the acrimony that precipitated two 
suspensions of parliament in a decade 
saadoun and other activists expressed fear the government would 
amend the constitution to curtail the powers of parliament 
this rape of democracy cannot be tolerated he said all 
nonconstitutional action including the current national council 
must be abolished without delay 
the emir has spoken of eventual return to a desired 
parliament which was widely interpreted as return to a 
westernstyle body 
several activists believe however that jaber might opt for an 
islamictype shura consultative council rather than a genuine 
legislature which would please theocratic saudi arabia and other 
conservative arab states

the economy is in shambles after 15 years 
of civil war and president elias hrawi has gone on the road 
seeking at least 20 billion in foreign aid to rescue it 
one safeguard against total economic collapse is lebanons gold 
reserves of about 32 billion but falling gold prices have cost 
the treasury about 500 million in the past 18 months the national 
debt is estimated at 23 billion 
onethird of the bullion is stored at fort knox ky and the 
rest in underground central bank vaults in moslem west beirut 
foreign currency reserves held by the central bank virtually 
the only state institution that still functions have declined to 
650 million from 1 billion in december heavy fighting early this 
year drove down the lebanese pound and the bank sold some reserves 
to support the currency 
hrawi has been touring arab capitals in search of financial aid 
and a threemember arab league committee entrusted with ending the 
war is trying to raise 2 billion for lebanon 
premier salim hoss an economist and former banker said 2 
billion would be barely enough to reconstruct the 
infrastructure of an economy that once was the most flourishing 
in the middle east 
lebanese economists estimate reconstruction will cost at least 
21 billion but many put the figure higher 
citizens of lebanon are believed to have about 30 billion in 
assets outside the country bankers believe an end to the 
christianmoslem war which has cost an estimated 150000 lives 
since 1975 would bring much of it back 
a settlement remains elusive despite a peace plan mediated by 
the arab league and endorsed by lebanons parliament and the 
election of hrawi in october to implement it 
the long war has devastated the lebanese pound it was 25 to 
the dollar 15 years ago but hit 690 to the dollar in june 
all the several dozen banks in beirut speculate on the volatile 
lebanese money market they buy pounds if they believe things will 
improve even for a short time and dollars when they expect bad 
news 
even the central bank plays the market it uses the profits to 
finance the budget because government revenues have virtually 
disappeared 
revenue from customs levies collapsed when militias took over 
ports operating them illegally and even built their own ports 
the cost to the treasury is about 200 million a year 
prices are soaring in a country that imports at least 85 percent 
of its necessities precise statistics are rare but economists and 
bankers estimate the annual inflation rate at 400 percent 
the general federation of labor unions which represents 250000 
workers puts unemployment at 47 percent and says most people with 
jobs must moonlight to make ends meet 
lebanon has no social welfare system so the unemployed rely on 
working relatives leave the country resort to crime or join 
militias 
fierce fighting in the past 18 months between christians and 
syrians and between rival christian forces have taken a terrible 
economic toll 
artillery battles destroyed or damaged hundreds of factories an 
shops a un report in june said fighting between christians that 
began jan 30 had caused damage totaling 500 million 
unprecedented damage to electricity water and 
telecommunications systems has directly affected 15 million people 
seriously affecting all social and economic life it said 
last month economist marwan iskandar predicted economic and 
social catastrophe unless effective action was taken in the next 
few months 
iskandar writing in the independent annahar daily urged the 
government to sell its gold reserves and invest the money in 
european government bonds to bring in about 350 million a year 
he said government spending should be limited to that amount and 
such stateowned utilities as power plants water oil refineries 
and communications systems should be sold to private investors 
finance minister ali khalil noted that four years ago the 
parliament forbade the sale of bullion because we feared that 
replacing gold with foreign currencies would open the door wide to 
government spending 
beirut was the middle easts banking capital before the war 
bustling with western tycoons and arab oil sheiks 
when the israeli army invaded in 1982 billions of dollars in 
arab assets held in lebanon fled to europe even now most of the 
several dozen lebanese banks keep up to 90 percent of their assets 
liquid 
lebanons economy has been cushioned by aid from arab and other 
countries and by large amounts of money given the militias by 
foreign backers including syria libya iraq iran israel and the 
palestine liberation organization 
economists estimated there are 80000 armed irregulars in 
lebanon 
another source of invisible income is the trade in opium and 
hashish grown in the syriancontrolled bekaa valley of east 
lebanon which earns about 200 million a year for the growers

joe slovo lionized by blacks 
and vilified by whites is a lifelong revolutionary who leads one 
of the few communist movements still in ascendancy 
slovo the mildmannered white lawyer was on the african national 
congress team that met with the white national party government in 
talks between south africas two most powerful political forces 
the other joe slovo who angers whites and is an idol to young 
blacks is general secretary of the south african communist party 
and former head of the anc guerrilla campaign 
by marking me out as enemy no 1 he said in an interview 
the government has endeared me in the hearts of most people in 
this country at 64 slovo looks more like a favorite uncle than 
a leader of revolution 
he is goodhumored engaging and slightly rumpled with bushy 
eyebrows thick glasses that slide down his nose a full head of 
gray hair and a gravel voice from heavy smoking 
slovo fled south africa in 1963 and returned in april wearing a 
dark blue suit loud floral tie cherry red socks and a wide smile 
as i was saying before i was so rudely interrupted 27 years 
ago he said at an airport news conference we are really on 
our way 
nelson mandela said slovo was the primary african national 
congress speaker on most major issues discussed with the government 
in may slovo probably will play a similar role in any future 
negotiations on ending apartheid 
however easygoing the exterior he is a dedicated revolutionary 
who became a communist party member at age 15 slovos parents 
immigrated from lithuania 
he does not apologize for his years as leader of an anc bombing 
and sabotage campaign that caused hundreds of deaths and injuries 
mostly to blacks 
his wife and fellow communist ruth first was killed by a 
parcel bomb in neighboring mozambique in 1982 slovo says that 
south african agents were responsible and that he also has been a 
target 
what sustained me was the certainty that i would come back 
slovo said of his long exile i never doubted that for one 
moment 
in 1987 he gave up leadership of the ancs armed wing to 
concentrate on the communist party he remains on the anc 
policymaking body the national executive committee 
the anc and south african communist party have been allies since 
the 1920s and slovo is one of several people who holds posts in 
both 
an angry reader wrote in the citizen a conservative newspaper 
he and his ilk have destroyed the peace of south africa red joe 
should never have come back 
former president pw botha cited the governments decision to 
allow slovos return as one reason he quit the national party after 
more than 50 years 
at rallies in black townships chants of viva nelson mandela 
viva often are followed by cries of viva joe slovo viva 
the red flag of the communist party invaribly hangs beside the 
green gold and black of the anc at such rallies 
south africa seems to be one of the last places on earth where 
the display of the hammer and sickle at public rallies still evokes 
cheers herman nickel a former us ambassador to south africa 
wrote in the wall street journal 
many blacks equate apartheid with capitalism and are drawn to 
the socialist economics of the communist party but young blacks in 
particular have little formal understanding of either system 
the south african communist party was founded in 1921 and banned 
in 1950 secrecy about policies and membership makes its strength 
hard to measure but its key role in the anc is unquestioned and 
the communists also are considered influential in the trade union 
movement 
president fw de klerk legalized the party in february along 
with other antiapartheid groups slovo said he remains convinced 
socialism can succeed in south africa despite the collapse of 
communist governments in eastern europe 
perhaps the reason they changed their names and their 
leadership and their policies is because they have a past to be 
ashamed of he said of the east european communists i dont 
think we have 
nonetheless the south african communists have moderated their 
positions after decades of loyalty to the soviet unions communist 
party 
slovo calls for a multiparty democracy and says transition from 
capitalism to a socialist state would be a longterm process 
pursued peacefully 
many white south africans still suspect the worst of the 
communists however 
ken owen editor of financial daily business day wrote 
behind the smiling mask lies an organization that thrives on 
secrecy totalitarian driven by fascist instincts undemocratic 
manipulative

president alan garcia will leave office 
saturday in disgrace having presided over the most disastrous 
economic decline in perus 169year history but he may be back 
many politicians and analysts think he plans to seek the 
presidency again in 1995 after sitting out a term because peruvian 
presidents cannot serve consecutive terms 
alan garcia is a firstrate politician said independent 
congressman alfredo barnechea a former ally hes a man full of 
political resources and talents 
barnechea is skeptical of garcias chances however because of 
the liberal freemarket revolution spreading over the world 
garcia has entered a hard rock disco singing boleros from the 
1950s said barnechea who quit the presidents centerleft 
aprista party and is allied with the more conservative democratic 
front at some point the people are going to realize this 
when he took office five years ago garcia was 36 years old 
6foot3 with a baby face the youngest president on the continent 
some called him the john f kennedy of latin america because of 
his youth and the hope his populism inspired 
his waist has thickened since 1985 and his speeches draw more 
jeers than applause one pundit described him as less the kennedy 
of the region than the elvis presley 
garcias most publicized actions were limiting payments on the 
foreign debt to 10 percent of foreign earnings then stopping all 
payments he used the money to finance a dramatic shortlived 
economic expansion 
as the boom slowed the government was plagued by labor strife 
leftist insurgencies and an elephantine bureaucracy that gobbled up 
intis the peruvian currency as fast as they were printed 
garcias popularity plummeted 
during his term inflation totaled 2 million percent and 10000 
people were killed in a spreading guerrilla war 
fourfifths of peruvian workers do not have steady jobs the 
nation owes 20 billion abroad and is isolated from international 
lenders 
on two occasions garcia fended off coup threats by the 
military at one point in 1988 he did not leave the government 
palace for 34 straight days and offered his resignation to vice 
president luis alberto sanchez who was 88 years old and blind 
sanchez refused it 
an understanding of the aprista party is necessary to any 
assessment of garcias potential appeal and chances of a comback 
barnechea said 
it is officially called apra for american popular revolutionary 
alliance and was founded in 1924 as a noncommunist alternative to 
the antiimperialist left and antielitist middle class 
the party won elections in 1962 but the military prevented it 
from taking power in 1985 garcia became the first aprista 
president 
apra became perus bestorganized party during 61 years of 
opposition with its own flag and anthem many of those years were 
spent underground with the party leaders in exile 
barnechea described apra as a complex institution that had 
lost its sense of political identity 
like all mythologies it exists at a distance from reality 
he said the victory or failure of its deeds have no relation to 
the rise or fall in the faith of its followers 
he said the partys 20 percent of the vote in the first round of 
the 1990 presidential election came mostly from party diehards and 
its perfectly conceivable garcia believes this to be a good 
start for a presidential campaign in 1995 
garcia regained his stride and some of his popularity in the 
1990 campaign although aprista candidate luis alva castro was 
eliminated in the first round the president remained a factor in 
the runoff between centrist alberto fujimori and novelist mario 
vargas llosa a champion of free markets 
he used the government newspaper and television station as well 
as pagina libre a new lima newspaper in which he is said to hold a 
major share to attack vargas llosas economic shock proposals 
fujimori won the june 10 election in a landslide and garcia 
quickly claimed the victory 
mr fujimori represents the negation of everything the other 
candidate stood for he said the voters said no to liberalism 
no to the right im totally identified with the feeling behind 
that vote 
since the election fujimori has slowly warmed to the idea of an 
economic shock and has begun mending fences with foreign lenders 
the new president has said he will dismantle garcias price subsidy 
programs and controls on currency exchange rates 
the shift by fujimori leaves garcia an opening to lead the 
opposition which analysts say would help his chances in 1995 if 
the new government falters 
alberto fujimori shouldnt forget his commitment and 
responsibility is first with perus poor majority said an 
unsigned editorial in pagina libre that many believe garcia wrote 
political commentator fernando rospigliosi wrote of garcia in 
the news magazine caretas between being the head of the 
opposition or an ally with the government theres no doubt which 
role he would prefer

for two ugly weeks boxings dirty laundry 
filled a manhattan courtroom promoters discussing their lies 
lawyers flinging charges and countercharges the heavyweight 
champion of the world reduced to mere verbal sparring 
when it ended this past week with a negotiated peace las vegas 
hotel casino owner steve wynn stepped into the sunshine of a 
downtown sidewalk and proclaimed the whole exercise beneficial to 
business 
i hope so i hope so wynn replied when asked if the legal 
shenanigans would help hype the upcoming james buster 
douglasevander holyfield fight which may itself visit the 
courtroom before it reaches the ring 
this will be the biggest betting fight since haglerleonard 
said wynn cutting quickly to the one thing that turns boxings 
bitterest enemies into fast friends money 
as don king an expert on boxings scheming and scamming has 
said again and again and again only in america 
buster hates don busters manager hates don don is afraid of 
steve buster thinks dons a liar don thinks busters breaking a 
contract which means of course that all four are now partners in 
promoting busters next fight after holyfield 
wynns elation was over an agreement that could pit douglas 
against holyfield on oct 25 in the first heavyweight title fight 
since feb 10 eight months of lawyers instead of lefts juries 
instead of jabs 
douglas has spent more time on the witness stand 40 minutes 
than he has in the ring none since his upset knockout of 
exchamp mike tyson 
its a horrible shame that buster douglas reign is 
characterized by repeated lawsuits said kathy duva of main event 
monitor promotions this whole thing has been a sin 
duvas company handles holyfield and they intend to hold 
douglas to a sept 21 fight date to which both sides agreed before 
the douglasking legal battle main event joined in the 
interminable litigation by asking a judge to order that the fight 
take place as originally scheduled 
this follows the us district court trial in a suit brought by 
king against douglas lowlights of the case included 
kings description of the heavyweight champion as a hot 
dogandbeer fighter when he came on people went to the 
refreshment stand 
king and fellow promoter bob arums bizarre excuses for their 
mendacious behavior according to don i wouldnt call it lying 
thats just my style as for arum he pleaded hyperbole 
hyperbole is not lying hyperbole is exaggeration 
wynn who will be kings copromoter for douglas first fight 
after holyfield was ominously characterized by his spikyhaired 
soontobe business partner as someone everyones afraid of 
arum boasted that his description of wbc president jose 
sulaiman and wba president gilberto mendoza as two little 
noriegas was one of my better lines 
arum also told the jury what constituted peace in the boxing 
world just a single lawsuit pending between himself and king 
do you know how many times don king and i have sued each other 
over the past 10 years arum asked weve done dastardly things 
to each other we wouldnt do to other people 
arum who spent most of the last decade going after kings 
throat appeared as a witness on his exadversarys behalf 
things were so strange in the courtroom that us district judge 
robert w sweet who presided over the trial told attorneys for 
both sides i wouldnt want to be a juror in this case for 
anything 
one exasperated lawyer worn out by attempts to crossexamine 
king told sweet mr kings perception of what is being asked 
often differs from reality 
sometimes thats a problem the judge acknowledged 
but all the problems were worked out as they always are so 
that everybody can make a buck forgive and forget until next 
time 
the issue was emotional the problem started in tokyo but 
once we got together and worked things out it went away wynn 
explained after the settlement 
translation king and donald trump received several million 
dollars just to walk away douglas will make his money again in the 
ring benefiting his manager wynn and wynns las vegas hotel 
casino 
after the settlement king announced hed finally give douglas a 
promised 100000 bonus for defeating tyson im a man of my 
word king said in the hallway outside the courtroom ignoring 
the smirks of reporters 
king also invited all the jurors to his next fight promotion 
the sept 22 atlantic city bout between tyson and alex stewart the 
panelists appeared amazed by the greed backstabbing and chicanery 
theyd heard about in court 
one of the jurors talking with douglas manager john johnson 
after the settlement summed it up best 
in boxing it doesnt seem you can listen to what anybody 
says gabrielle mellett told johnson who nodded in agreement 
what they say isnt really what they mean

unemployment is hitting rural areas harder 
these days partly because so many communities now depend less on 
farming and more on other types of jobs according to a report 
released saturday 
the economic policy institute report said that in the 1980s a 
proportionately larger number of rural workers were laid off 
compared to their urban counterparts 
between 1981 and 1984 approximately 63 million workers were 
displaced from fulltime wage and salary jobs the report said 
of these 16 million or 26 percent resided in rural areas 
higher than the rural share of total employment 21 percent 
rural workers also experienced longer periods of unemployment 
and were more likely to be forced into new jobs at lower pay than 
their old ones 
the report job displacement and the rural worker said 
rural economies have grown away from a reliance on agriculture and 
have become more dependent on manufacturing and service industries 
thus it said rural workers are more vulnerable to shifts that 
result in widespread job loss from layoffs and plant closings 
the studys author michael podgursky of the university of 
massachusetts said rural workers have a harder time recovering 
from economic dislocation both earnings and employment prospects 
for rural workers diminished in the 1980s 
permanent job loss from layoffs and plant closings is 
occurring more frequently in rural areas and the effect is much 
more severe podgursky said rural americans are at a distinct 
disadvantage in the labor market the economic infrastructure of 
rural regions just cannot absorb large numbers of unemployed 
workers 
for example the study said about 15 percent of rural displaced 
workers remained unemployed after losing their jobs compared with 
10 percent for jobless city workers 
also displaced rural workers were 50 percent more likely to 
experience a severe loss of earnings a pay cut of more than 25 
percent than city workers 
loss of group health insurance is another major problem for 
displaced rural workers the report said only 65 percent were able 
to obtain new health care insurance compared with 74 percent for 
urban workers 
the economic policy institute is a nonprofit nonpartisan 
economic research organization founded in 1986 and supported by 
grants from foundations unions corporations and individuals 
rural development is an old struggle it has involved virtually 
every chamber of commerce main street business and industry for 
generations 
there have been repeated moves in congress to assist rural 
development ranging from public works and tax incentives to 
expanded credit programs and outright grants 
both the house and senate have approved rural development bills 
differences between the two have yet to be settled by conference 
negotiations 
the senate version includes a 300 million revolving fund for 
new businesses satellite education and health communications 
systems the house bill would establish state review panels to set 
priorities on how federal money should be used 
but federal spending cuts and budget considerations are putting 
the squeeze on all programs 
earlier this month the white house announced a new presidents 
council on rural america to advise on how the federal government 
can improve its rural economic development policy 
councils committees or task forces have been common through the 
years and often their recommendations are limited by the 
availability of funds 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter was asked after the white 
house announcement about recommendations made by previous rural 
development advisers including a plan announced by president bush 
in january 
some of their recommendations are either in the process of 
being implemented or are under consideration within the 
department he said 
yeutter added that he thought there has been a lot more 
rhetoric than performance in rural development through the years 
weve been talking about rural development in the department of 
agriculture and in this country for the last 20 years but not 
accomplishing very much 
the report by the economic policy institute reinforces other 
studies that have shown rural america to be on the short end of the 
nations economic and social scale 
for example the center of budget and policy priorities reported 
that 33 percent of the working poor live in rural areas although 
only 23 percent of the us population lives there 
most of the rural poor who are not elderly disabled or sick 
are people who work but earn too little to escape poverty the 
center said in a report last october

while it makes a handy slogan in a campaign 
year the balanced budget amendment wouldnt have put a dent in the 
deficit any time soon if ever 
curbing deficits will require tough politically painful 
decisions on spending and taxes item by item by contrast theres 
no political downside to a vote in favor of amending the 
constitution in the name of balanced federal budgets 
so a house majority voted for the amendment falling just seven 
short of the twothirds margin it takes to approve a proposed 
change in the constitution a day later the house overwhelmingly 
approved a bill to require that government revenues and 
expenditures be equal beginning in the next budget year 
that too is political symbolism because it probably wont 
pass the senate and couldnt be enforced even if it became law but 
it gave house members another opportunity to record votes in favor 
of balanced budgets after the constitutional amendment was turned 
down on tuesday 
measures like those have been argued for years sometimes 
approved then forgotten or waived nearly 400 times in a decade 
in the case of a measure that was supposed to curb spending 
the only restraint that counts is the one that has the heat on 
now the grammrudman budget control law that will force drastic 
automatic spending cuts in the middle of the fall campaign unless 
congress and the white house come to terms on sharp reductions in 
the projected deficit now forecast at a swollen 1688 billion 
that law too has been eased and probably will be again as part 
of any 1990 settlement 
the problem is that deficits are made up of hundreds of 
decisions not one judgment that can be reversed with a single 
stroke no constitutional amendment is going to balance the budget 
any more than a constitutional amendment stopped people from 
drinking liquor 
habits persist no matter what is written into the constitution 
and deficits have been habitual the pattern in 50 of the past 58 
years the rule in 20 of the past 21 
every spending program has a constituency of interests and 
individuals voters who benefit while the cost is spread among 
all the taxpayers or added to the national debt the congressman 
who votes for spending targeted at his constituents can and does 
follow up with speeches denouncing deficits 
eight years ago ronald reagan pushed a balanced budget 
amendment as an antidote to his own administrations budget which 
forecast a record deficit reagan and now president bush have 
been seeking approval ever since although neither has sent 
congress a balanced budget 
in 1982 the senate controlled by republicans approved the 
amendment 69 to 31 the house turned it down 46 votes short of the 
required twothirds majority 
the senate came within a vote of reviving the balanced budget 
amendment in 1986 narrowly rejecting a democratic version that 
measure is up again but house rejection forecloses congressional 
approval of an amendment this year were one to be approved it 
would go to the states for ratification 
the near miss in the house this time reflects the frustration 
the dilemma and the political discomfort of deficits that have 
swollen the national debt to 31 trillion and counting 
the version the house rejected would have required presidents to 
propose balanced budgets each year with congress and the 
administration then agreeing on anticipated revenues and spending 
no more unless threefifths of the members of each house vote to do 
so 
that certainly would make deficit votes more difficult but it 
comes with variables loopholes and no enforcement terms and it 
orders an outcome not a solution one opponent rep jack brooks 
dtexas chairman of the judiciary committee said it would mean no 
more than a bumper sticker 
while they argued about the impact of an amendment sponsors and 
opponents agreed in their setpiece debate that congress lacks the 
political will and the courage to cope with the deficit 
an advocate said the only people who would have been hurt by a 
balanced budget amendment including a provision making it more 
difficult to impose new taxes would be thousands of lobbyists who 
want taxes raised so they can get more money appropriated for the 
interests they represent 
but lobbyists dont vote on taxes or on appropriations members 
of congress do that

the words almost shout off the wall of what used 
to be a 19th century mercantile shipping supply house in the now 
fashionable section of manhattan called tribeca 
its my body its not pepsis body its not nancy reagans 
body its not congresss body my body is paid for in full by 
me my body is mine says the defiant handpainted script 
these are the thoughts and ideas of karen finley one of four 
performance artists denied fellowship grants in june by the 
national endowment for the arts the rejections triggered a 
firestorm of protests from arts groups across the country as well 
as support for the nea decision by conservative critics in congress 
and various religious groups 
the four were turned down for fellowships by nea chairman john 
frohnmayer and its advisory board the national council on the 
arts despite unanimous recommendations by a peer panel fourteen 
performance artists did receive grants ranging from 5000 to 
11250 
performance art first flourished in the mid1970s primarily in 
the new york and los angeles art worlds it used theater dance 
music and the visual arts to make its points works were staged 
everywhere from theaters to the streets artists could use 
everything from elaborate props and costumes to none at all 
anything went and usually did 
the other rejected artists are holly hughes of new york john 
fleck of los angeles and tim miller of santa monica calif but so 
far finley has received the most publicity 
finleys installation at franklin furnace an organization 
founded in 1976 to present visual works as well as performance art 
includes two long essays painted on the walls of the gallery both 
essays deal with violence against women specifically rape and 
abortion the language is frank often violent and crude 
the four artists denied grants are all in their 30s all have 
received federal money in the past and all are appealing their 
rejections three of the artists are homosexual and celebrate their 
sexuality in their work 
some like finley use nudity in performance much has been made 
in the media of finleys performance piece we keep our victims 
ready in which she dances nude and smears her body with 
chocolate to show the degradation of women 
i am being punished because i am a morally concerned artist 
finley said during a recent emotional press conference at the 
public theater 
finley 34 was raised in evanston ill where her mother was a 
civil rights activist and her father sold appliances and worked as 
a jazz drummer she grew up on the rhetoric of the 1960s being 
particularly moved by the speeches of martin luther king and john 
kennedy 
i have made a commitment in creating work that addresses 
social concerns said finley who when she isnt touring lives 
with her husband in nyack ny north of new york city much of 
my work deals with victims in our society and i use the language of 
how society treats these victims women people living with aids 
minorities gays and lesbians the homeless and the victims of 
child abuse incest and violent crimes 
hughes work is sexual but she uses humor too to make 
political statements the 35yearold performer is from saginaw 
mich where she grew up in a middleclass republican household 
hughes came to new york to be a painter but ended up in 
performance art acting out her own pieces in small downtown and 
east village clubs 
she calls her work storytelling and her bestknown 
monologue is titled world without end written in honor of her 
mother who died in 1987 
its about my mother telling me the facts of life hughes 
said in an interview the piece is informational i realized it 
was amazingly in contrast to a lot of stories i had heard from 
friends of mine whose mothers gave them absolutely no sexual 
information it was a very positive experience in the piece i say 
it was a gift the best thing my mother ever did for me she had a 
certain pride in her body that was really wonderful 
john fleck calls himself a pop culture commentator but hes an 
actor as well for the last six months ive been doing other 
peoples work he says to me im doing theater 
fleck moved to california from cleveland 18 years ago at age 21 
to attend the los angeles branch of the american academy of 
dramatic arts he studied there for three years 
ever since then ive been doing every workshop imaginable 
he says i also type 110 words per minute thats how i also 
supported myself 
there also were small parts in the mainstream of show business 
three lines in an episode of cheers a spot on hooperman 
various commercials a short moment on screen with bernadette 
peters in the clint eastwood film pink cadillac 
fleck started doing his own work about eight years ago in los 
angeles rock n roll clubs id get up and sing and dance and 
kind of rip my clothes off he said laughing you know you 
have to do a lot to keep those hedonists attention so to speak 
he started doing more theatrical pieces about five years ago 
i have a 3octave voice so id play all the male and females 
roles he said my early pieces had a lot to do with sexual 
ambiguity the split between the male and female sides of myself 
and the conflict created by them not being able to accept one 
another 
tim millers monologues also deal with his sexuality 
my performances draw from stories and points of view from my 
own life said the 31yearold miller originally from whittier 
calif a lot of it explores my identity as a gay person theres 
a lot of political content in the material 
miller also is an aids activist and his work reflects his 
frustration and anger with the federal government for what he says 
is its slow response to the aids crisis but there is humor in his 
work too 
i talk about sex but no more than eddie murphy and probably 
quite a bit less he said miller has just returned from an 
extended crosscountry tour playing everywhere from high schools 
to art museums he also worked with malcolm boyd an openly gay 
episcopal priest and author of are you running with me jesus 
in what miller calls performance art sermons done in a 
california church on easter sunday 
all four artists are receiving more offers to work than they 
have gotten in the past finleys performance in new york at 
lincoln centers serious fun festival this wednesday quickly sold 
out and a second performance was added 
still the notoriety has had its affect on them 
its horrible in a way hughes said artists want 
attention but its not the kind of attention you want its not 
coming from someone saying wow shes the most fabulous thing 
since canned ham people are coming to see me because they wonder 
is she really as terrible as they say or is she really 
pornographic it has become sort of a freak show

so you say what will happen when they 
lock four men and four women inside this fancy fish bowl for two 
years and watch em grow alfalfa sprouts and rice 
how indeed are eight biospherians going to fare testing 
the completely sealed compound with five adjacent but contrasting 
environments called biomes as well as an intensive agricultural 
complex to duplicate the earths ecology 
how are they going to react in shepherding 3800 species of 
plants and animals that will provide food and air while all wastes 
are recycled within biosphere ii 
and in getting along with each other 
exceedingly well according to predictions 
its unlikely all agree that any of the eight crew members to 
be selected later this year from among 14 candidates in this 30 
million private experiment will go bonkers withdrawal or 
confrontation under stress are unlikely all say 
theyre so highly motivated in the first place i would not be 
surprised to see the whole thing go through without a hitch 
personnelwise said robert b bechtel an environmental 
psychologist at the university of arizona 
my guess would be that they would probably have somewhat fewer 
problems than you would normally encounter in the classical 
isolation experience said mary connors a psychologist and 
division staff member at the national aeronautics and space 
administrations ames research center near sunnyvale calif who 
until recently was acting chief of its crew research and space 
human factors branch they just have more options 
the biospherians will be physically separated from the outside 
world or biosphere i but they will not be isolated said john 
rummel a life sciences physician at nasa nor are they likely to 
suffer sensory deprivation or claustrophobia in the main compound 
which measures 2 acres 
theyll have the latest gadgets from video teleconferencing and 
worldwide phone contact to television vcrs and computers in their 
plush apartment complex and officelaboratory area 
and they will have unusual options if they want to get away from 
each other the biospherians will be able to stargaze from their 
own rain forest or ocean beach 
experiments in longterm situations where small groups of people 
live in harsh climatic or environmental extremes such as the in 
antarctica or underwater usually are viewed in terms of 
isolation confinement deprivation and risk connors said 
but crew members will be allowed to leave through air locks if 
health or extreme family emergencies necessitate eliminating the 
sense of risk she said 
roy walford a pathologist nutrition specialist and the only 
physician seeking one of the eight slots says he thinks the 
biggest problem may be overwork 
a community and rural health family practitioner associated with 
the university of arizona who has developed a close relationship 
with the candidates will be among those watching from the outside 
walford and biosphere spokeswoman kathleen dyhr also hoping to 
make the crew said each candidate has worked on the project for at 
least three years 
ms dyhr said the selection process uses no psychological 
testing rather such factors as ability to work together 
problemsolving skills willingness to accept other views and 
professionalism are keys and by selecting for some of those 
factors you can relieve a lot of interpersonal tensions 
connors and bechtel said the strong job focus crosswork 
training and the fact that the potential crew members have worked 
and spent significant time together all are highly advantageous 
creativity spontaneity withdrawal unexpected irritability 
eating patterns and general health will be watched but the best 
sensors likely will be the crew members themselves 
most say the crew will develop its own equilibrium once 
closed life gets under way 
but will that lead to romantic relationships to interludes 
under the waterfall or in the huge basements beneath the complex 
will the crew be celibate 
views range from who cares to unlikely to probable 
mine has always been that its unlikely because i think 
people tend to act as crews when they get in an experience that is 
prolonged connors said 
i would suspect that they would get into a familial 
relationship rather than a couples relationship more like 
siblings act she said 
bechtel said how could you avoid it but on the other hand 
theyre in a fish bowl 
lets just put it this way ms dyhr said theres nothing 
really that a corporation can do about what their employees do 
after 5 oclock we live in a free country and for the most part 
people do whatever they want to do 
but what if two people fall in love is marriage by 
teleconferencing possible 
given the fact that various members of the clergy have shown 
themselves to be innovative and agreeable to doing marriages under 
very unusual circumstances im sure that they could find a way to 
do it ms dyhr said 
on the other extreme the psychologists say literature on 
confinement and isolation studies shows few examples of violence 
the biospheres purpose is not to test interpersonal 
relations but to test whether they can reproduce the earths 
atmosphere by a mixture of plants animals and bacteria bechtel 
said 
bechtel thinks the biggest problem will be whether seals around 
the glass panels covering the gigantic geodesic dome stay under 
wide ranges of heat and cold 
he and connors also said most studies of crews including 
mixedsex groups in environments far harsher and smaller than the 
biospherians are likely to encounter have shown them to be highly 
motivated energetic and willing to put up with almost anything for 
the sake of the project and the teams success 
bechtel said the public has a misconception that putting eight 
people together will mean all kinds of interesting things can 
happen 
rather he said theyre really caretakers theyre really out 
there to tend the plants and animals its a kind of farming 
adventure

the nissan pickup with the george bush bumper 
sticker has become a regular sight out front the softspoken 
bespectacled alabama pediatricianturnedpolitico is learning his 
way around 
and four months after taking over as director of the centers for 
disease control william l roper has set about charting his course 
for his 5000employee agency 
even if pressed he wont predict the next big breakthroughs in 
public health but he is willing to talk about public health his 
field before entering the world of the federal government and his 
three personal priorities for the cdc the governments lead public 
health agency 
soon after coming to cdc roper outlined those priorities in 
three speeches 
one is strengthening the nations publichealth infrastructure 
although he jokes that discussions of infrastructure are among 
the worlds leading insomnia cures 
the second is emphasizing prevention 
one of the real challenges is that it requires to a great 
extent motivating individual people to take actions that they do 
not see an immediate benefit from such as stopping smoking or 
eating right he said in a recent interview 
ropers third priority and perhaps his most important is 
promoting childrens health not surprising for a pediatrician 
we have not done nearly as much as we could do to improve the 
health of children in america roper said we have focused 
resources and attention dominantly on illnesses affecting middle 
aged and senior citizens and i think its time we did the same for 
children 
its not that childrens health is worse today than it was 
five years 10 years 20 years ago its just that its not nearly 
as good as it can be 
while setting his priorities roper hopes to forge a new 
identity for the cdc itself a sevencenter agency 
cdcs niche is epidemiology the tracking and prevention of 
disease as opposed to some of the more tangible things that our 
sister agency nih national institutes of health does when they 
unveil a breakthrough treatment for some illness roper explained 
in a variety of ways im trying to give cdc an identity for 
itself he added 
the cdc prides itself on its alliances with state and local 
health officials prevention programs developed in atlanta are 
passed on to state officials and then to local health clinics 
the most important thing for us to do is to develop the 
information and the strategies that others can use said roper a 
former alabama county health official we at the federal 
government level are at least two steps removed from where the 
action really is 
roper says he intends to be a strong crusader against smoking 
which kills an estimated 1000 americans each day while his boss 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan has yet to 
directly condemn federal tobacco subsidies roper says flatly that 
its incongruous to pay farmers to grow a cancercausing crop 
but you know how that gets stopped he asked its not 
cdc its congress if congress wanted to change this they 
could 
however he concedes one of our audiences is the us 
congress i have a role to play there in persuading them to take 
action 
roper describes himself as a strongly committed federalist 
set on seeing that enough federal money goes through the states to 
the local health departments 
but roper administrator of the health care financing 
administration before joining the bush administration as a science 
issues specialist is well aware that times are tough for many 
federal programs 
the federal budget is in real difficulty he said id be 
kidding myself if i said all ive got to do is raise my hand and 
well have a gusher of money we have to sell people on the 
worthiness of cdc programs 
but he added i wouldnt have taken this job if i didnt see 
my way clear to some successes on the budget front 
still financing of federal health programs has been a major 
concern of cdcs critics and it will continue to be under roper 
at least for a while 
we know that ropers a political guy said mark harrington 
a member of the treatment and data committee at the advocacy group 
actup aids committee to unleash power 
actup has accused the cdc of limiting aids casecounting 
measures refusing to recognize legitimate cases and minimizing the 
perceived problem in order to limit the governments expenditures 
on the disease 
were worried that rather than taking a medical look at the 
epidemiology theyll keep on playing that political game 
harrington said but its really too early to accuse him roper 
of that

close relatives of insulindependent diabetics 
should take a blood test that reveals high risk of getting the 
disease but only if they will consider entering a research study 
the american diabetes association says 
the public should avoid the test an association official says 
the associations statement covers siblings parents and 
children of insulindependent diabetics about 1 million americans 
have this form of the disease which usually strikes in childhood 
or adolescence 
people with insulindependent diabetes must take daily insulin 
injections 
in recent years scientists have developed several screening 
tests to point out people at high risk of developing 
insulindependent diabetes 
the new statement was adopted in june at the associations 
annual meeting it is the associations first acknowledgement that 
insulindependent diabetes can be predicted said richard kahn 
chief scientific and medical officer 
the association statement discourages screening that is 
unrelated to research studies it recommends screening of close 
relatives of insulindependent diabetics but only if those found 
to be at heightened risk are referred to institutions doing 
research into prevention or some other aspect of the disease the 
statement says 
without such a followup screening is an expensive exercise 
that doesnt get one anywhere said dr jay skyler chairman of 
the task force that developed the policy 
an initial screening test which is being offered commercially 
for about 300 can indicate a heightened risk of developing 
diabetes but not say when the disease will appear skyler said 
a positive result creates an enormous amount of anxiety on the 
part of family members he said so maybe its better not to 
know unless the screened person will consider participating in 
research which may prevent the disease from appearing skyler said 
scientists are itching to go with largescale studies of 
possible preventive therapies kahn said such experiments which 
may start within six months are aimed at suppressing the immune 
systems attack on insulinproducing cells of the pancreas he said 
the initial screening test looks for proteins called antibodies 
in the blood that indicate the body has begun attacking the 
insulinproducing cells called islet cells 
such antibodies are present in the blood of 80 percent to 90 
percent of people with insulindependent diabetes at the time of 
diagnosis and most of them also have the antibodies for several 
years before diagnosis skyler said 
while perhaps one in 20 close relatives will show those 
antibodies the rate for the general population is about one in 
1000 he said 
the association discourages using the test for the general 
population because that yield is low because the tests predictive 
value outside of close relatives is not firmly established and 
because the test requires extensive followup procedures to better 
assess a persons risk he said 
the followup tests include a search for antibodies that attack 
insulin and a test of how well the pancreas secretes insulin in 
response to sugar 
studies suggest that combined results of these tests can 
indicate relatives who are virtually certain to develop 
insulindependent diabetes within five years kahn said

chaos is making its way into the american 
kitchen 
the scientific concept of chaos known to experts as fractal 
geometry is being researched by food manufacturing specialists 
seeking ways to make or improve instant foods 
fractals describe the geometry of rugged surfaces including 
everything from coastlines to trees to instant hot cocoa mix 
the relationship between fractals and instant foods brought a 
university of puerto rico chemical engineer to the institute of 
food technologists annual conference recently at the anaheim 
convention center 
gustavo v barbosacanovas outlined to the convention his latest 
study that applies fractal geometry to food processing 
my approach uses powdered foods and studies how the food 
changes shape after exposure to vibrations from packing and 
shipping barbosa said in a telephone interview 
applying fractal analysis to food processing was first suggested 
in 1985 by food scientists micha peleg and md normand at the 
university of massachusetts 
they made the process feasible by determining the geometry of 
instant coffee with a scanning electron microscope barbosa said 
particle contour images were then automatically converted into 
digital numbers for computer analysis 
barbosa used instant coffee particles because he wanted to 
research how their ruggedness was affected by vibrations from 
packing and shipping 
as vibration or attrition occurs food products break down 
and decrease serving size 
food manufacturers are interested in maintaining larger 
particles in the food because the larger the particle remains the 
better its instant properties he said 
barbosas analysis technique may lead to improvements in a 
number of foods such as instant dry milk orange juice or 
applesauce and some powdered cheeses it may also work on the crumb 
structure of bread but this hasnt been shown yet barbosa said 
if a coffee lover has a choice between an instant coffee that 
dissolves immediately and another that takes two minutes to stir 
he will surely pick the more instant brand barbosa said 
agglomerated foods are more rugged because they are fabricated 
and are shaped into particles called fines fines are placed in 
a moist atmosphere where they stick to one another forming 
bridges barbosa said 
by contrast regular particles such as starches and sugars 
dont lend themselves to the technique 
barbosa said the science behind chaos proliferated in 
professional papers in the 1970s as use of personal computers 
increased scientists found more ways to measure and calculate the 
nearly endless formulas to describe complex surfaces 
fractals comes from the latin word fractus meaning fragment 
fractal geometry was introduced in 1977 by scientist benoit 
mandelbrot barbosa said 
the 25000member institute of food technologists is a 
professional society devoted to the discovery of new and existing 
knowledge to improve the worlds foods its members come from 
academic industrial and government organizations

most people know that protein is essential but there are many 
misconceptions about how much the body needs and what are the best 
sources 
take this trueorfalse quiz to see if you know the facts 
1 most americans eat more than enough protein 
2 proteins that come from animals contain all the essential 
amino acids the body needs 
3 as adults age they require less protein 
4 highprotein diets are not recommended for the obese 
5 red meats are better protein sources than poultry or fish 
6 athletes need significantly more protein than nonathletes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
answers 
1 true most americans consume double their requirement for 
protein for example the rda for a 130pound woman is easily met 
by eating three ounces of lean meat one slice of bread onehalf 
cup of cottage cheese and 1 cup of milk 
2 true animal proteins are considered complete meaning 
that they contain the needed amounts of the nine essential amino 
acids your body must get from food vegetables are not complete 
sources of protein they lack essential amino acids or do not 
contain them in sufficient quantities to meet your bodys needs 
only by combining complementary vegetables on the same day eg 
rice and beans can you receive a complete protein source 
3 false current thinking is that the rda for protein remains 
the same on a weight basis throughout adulthood some investigators 
think that because of changes in the bodys efficiency in using 
protein the elderly might require more however since calorie 
needs decrease as we age it is wise for the elderly to select 
lowfat sources of protein 
4 false highprotein lowcarbohydrate very lowcalorie 
diets can be effective for weight loss in obese people those who 
are approximately 25 percent or more above their normal weight 
range after an initial water loss significant amounts of fat are 
also lost however these diets can be hazardous and are 
recommended only for heart disease or adultonset diabetes and 
they should always be undertaken with medical supervision 
5 false red meats tend to be higher in fat so the percentage 
of protein on an ounceforounce basis is lower than in fish or 
poultry 
6 false although an athlete may need slightly more protein 
during the initial stages of training or competition that need is 
not very great since most americans already consume more than 
enough protein chances are the increased need has already been met 
by a normal diet

david hirsch left bismarck before dawn and 
headed for canada on a beetle run 
he should be back with a cooler full of 5000 flea beetles 
eating leafy spurge 
the strange odyssey is part of the steppedup battle against the 
weed considered one of north dakotas most persistent pests 
hirsch works for the animal and plant health inspection service 
of the us department of agriculture which is importing the 
beetles in the hope they will ravage the spurge infesting 12 
million acres across the state 
north dakota has north americas worst infestation of the tall 
weed with greenyellow flowers that was brought over from europe in 
the 19th century said peter harris an entomologist with canadas 
department of agriculture at a research station in regina 
saskatchewan he is considered the dean of biological control of 
leafy spurge hes also in charge of the beetles hirsch is picking 
up 
the adult bugs hirsch brings back will lay eggs in north dakota 
soil this summer the eggs will hatch this fall and the larvae 
will hibernate and next spring eat spurge root systems before 
they become adults 
after several years tests in canada show that up to 90 percent 
of a spurge stand could be eliminated harris said 
the state will spend about 460000 on spraying leafy spurge 
over the next two years mostly in a costshare program with 
counties

as incestuous marriages become more 
common in the united states scientists are unprepared to offer 
counseling about the likelihood of genetic disorders a university 
of michigan researcher said 
id been brought up to believe that inbreeding was pretty 
nasty said alan bittles a geneticist who has spent 10 years 
researching interfamily marriages in pakistan and india we never 
consider that in other parts of the world its perfectly normal to 
marry a cousin 
bittles said he has determined that 500 million people worldwide 
are married to relatives typically uncles and nieces or first or 
second cousins 
all those have got to be rockbottom low estimates because 
were missing information from so many parts of the world he 
said 
and as people move to the united states and other western 
nations traditions follow 
although there are fewer genetic disorders among children born 
to married family members than westerners believe scientists have 
made few studies of those problems and have little information 
about them he said 
inherited disorders include some blood diseases protein 
deficiencies spina bifida cleft palates and hip and heart 
deformities 
if parents from the same family marry and seek genetic 
counseling doctors can give only occurrence rates derived from 
general population studies bittles said 
we may be giving wrong advice he said we would be 
hardpressed in this community to tell them what their risks are 
bittles a fulbright fellow in the university of michigan 
population studies center is a geneticist from kings college in 
london he is one of only a few researchers studying intermarriage

the first nest ever reported in washington 
of a bird called a marbled murrelet has been found in oldgrowth 
hemlock cheering ornithologists and stirring new questions about 
logging of oldgrowth forests 
thats really exciting news said jim pissot executive 
director of the audubon society of washington 
he said it will strengthen the societys drive to see the chubby 
little shorebird listed as threatened by the us fish and wildlife 
service 
the bird is fairly common elsewhere and little is known about 
its nesting habits but the audubon petition filed in january 
1988 contends mounting biological evidence shows logging of 
coastal oldgrowth forests threatens the birds nesting habitat 
logging of millions of acres of public oldgrowth forest in 
washington oregon and california already is threatened since the 
fish and wildlife service declared the northern spotted owl a 
threatened species the owl nests in oldgrowth forest 
federal officials are working out a management plan to protect 
the owl and still take into account the affect on timber 
communities officials say reductions proposed in a federal 
scientific report could mean the loss of more than 20000 jobs over 
the next decade 
the murrelet nest containing one chick was found last week by 
state department of wildlife researcher tom hamers roughly 25 miles 
inland from port susan in snohomish county department spokesman 
john pierce said wednesday 
its parents apparently visit the nest only at dawn and dusk to 
feed the chick he said 
i cant tell you how exciting this is although weve had egg 
fragments turned in and fledglings found in the forest this is the 
first nest found after years and years of searching he said 
pierce said the only other marbled murrelet nest found this year 
was in oregons siuslaw national forest 
little is known about the nesting behavior of the brown and 
white robinsize murrelet according to a recent study by the 
state department of wildlife 
ornithologists have searched for its nests throughout its 
range from central california to the bering sea and from kamchatka 
soviet union to northern japan yet only 13 nests have been 
found said the study written by lora l leschner and eric b 
cummins 
the nests that have been found and recent discoveries of 
marbled murrelets at inland locations in oregon and california 
indicate that the species may be traveling inland to nest in 
oldgrowth forests leschner and cummins wrote 
the harvest of the last of the oldgrowth forests in coastal 
washington oregon and california and the increased harvest of 
oldgrowth in british columbia and alaska could pose a serious 
threat to marbled murrelet populations they said 
rick johnson associate northwest representative of the sierra 
club said the nest discovery shows how little we really know 
about the ancient forest ecosystem and in this case points to yet 
another species that is probably dependent on the forests for 
survival it means we have an even greater need to know

the revco drugstore chain was an ignominious 
groundbreaker in 1988 when it became the first company to file for 
bankruptcy court protection after a billiondollar takeover 
financed with junk bonds 
now another precedent could be emerging from the tangled mess of 
revco ds inc an examiner appointed by the bankruptcy court said 
this week the companys creditors may have grounds to sue 
shareholders investment bankers and other parties to recover 
losses caused by the 1986 leveraged buyout 
the report by examiner barry l zaretsky will only be used as an 
advisory opinion by the judge overseeing revcos reorganization 
but the opinion if it eventually finds its way into the law could 
have a chilling effect on other companies and other takeovers 
in his report zaretsky said that under the laws of michigan 
where revco is incorporated creditors might be able to sue because 
of the socalled fraudulent conveyance of the company 
the conveyance occurred when shareholders sold the company to 
the managementled investor group that engineered the 15 billion 
lbo 
a fraudulent conveyance is a transaction made without fair 
consideration if the debtor is rendered insolvent or is left with 
unreasonably small capital said zaretsky a professor at 
brooklyn law school in new york 
zaretsky admits litigation is no panacea for those waiting to 
paid but considering the rash of failed takeovers during the past 
year the prospect of a new avenue of redress for a firms 
creditors is nonetheless appealing 
in considering who might be liable to revco creditors zaretsky 
notes that investment bankers and others who helped arrange the 
buyout were paid 80 million in fees an amount he called grossly 
disproportionate to the benefit if any received by revco 
if investment firms could be held liable for the failed buyouts 
they arrange they might worry more about the ultimate success of 
the deals than with the fees they stood to make 
zaretsky stressed in his report that his conclusions were 
tentative and based on an asyet uncompleted examination of revcos 
problems 
but he said he has found a basis for proving the financial 
elements of a fraudulent conveyance and that revco was left 
with insufficient capital to conduct its business 
he also found evidence the leveraged buyout rendered revco 
insolvent 
in reaching his conclusions the examiner cited among other 
factors the impact on revcos business of loan agreements reached 
in the buyout process 
zaretsky also found fault with financial forecasts used by 
proponents of the buyout 
reasonable projections based on the same assumptions as those 
used in projections made available to the examiner would have shown 
that revco was left with insufficient capital to satisfy its then 
known obligations he said 
zaretskys findings were filed with the us bankruptcy court in 
akron ohio which is handling the revco case revco headquartered 
in twinsburg ohio filed for protection from its creditors after 
it missed an interest payment on 700 million in junk bonds used to 
finance the lbo 
zaretsky admits he has raised more questions than he has answers 
for calling remedies for creditors under a fraudulent conveyance 
suit largely virgin territory he said he would do further 
research before making recommendations on just who should pay and 
how 
however he said the courts could fashion an equitable remedy 
which would allow unsecured general creditors to be paid in full 
with interest at the expense of the parties who contributed to the 
fraudulent conveyance 
several times in his report zaretsky stated that negotiations 
between revco and its creditors would be a better means of 
resolving the situation although the talks have been bogged down 
for some time the examiner advised the court to bring in a 
mediator to hasten the processs 
if a reorganization plan for the company is not in the offing by 
november when statutes of limitations in the case are about to 
expire zaretsky warned he is likely to recommend the 
commencement of fraudulent conveyance litigation as well as suits 
on several other grounds 
it is possible he is raising the specter of a lawsuit as a way 
to get the parties off the dime zaretsky warned that if new 
litigation is spawned it will be a long process with uncertain 
results and it may take a further toll on revcos business

the securities and exchange commission says it 
supports new restrictions on the multibilliondollar business of 
advising people how to invest their money but says it could do 
more with more money 
sec commissioner mary l schapiro told a house panel wednesday 
that the commission now favors legislation requiring tougher sec 
registration requirements rather than farming out responsibility to 
an independent selfregulating organization 
she said the sec believed direct sec regulation of investment 
advisers is preferable to selfregulation 
last year the sec submitted legislation that would give 
investment adviser oversight to a selfregulatory organization such 
as the national association of securities dealers which oversees 
the overthecounter market 
but in testimony before the finance subcommittee of the house 
energy and commerce committee ms schapiro said the sec 
relunctantly lent its support to industry selfregulation because 
it didnt have the money to adequately police the industry and 
didnt think it was going to get more money soon 
she called for increasing registration fees investment advisers 
pay the sec and earmarking the money for enforcement the sec now 
does not keep any of the money it collects in fees but must turn 
it over to the treasury department for general government spending 
rep rick boucher dva a member of the subcommittee has 
submitted a bill that would require anyone offering investment 
advice for pay to register with the sec whether they call 
themselves an investment adviser or a financial planner 
they would be required to provide clients with accurate 
information the bill also would give customers the right to sue 
for damages when they lose money because of violations of the law 
bouchers bill would not increase sec fees however 
the bill also would continue the exemption from registration now 
in effect for banks as well as lawyers accountants and other 
professionals who give investment advice only as a sideline 
ms schapiro said she had no problem with that but others did 
mary a malgoire of the national association of personal 
financial advisors a professional association of planners that 
earn only fees not commissions opposed the exemptions for 
lawyers and accountants 
she said such professionals if not registered with sec would 
not be subject to financial planning oversight from state licensing 
boards 
outside the hearing room ms schapiro told reporters the sec 
currently spends 57 million annualy on registering and reviewing 
investment advisers 
to do everything recommended in a general accounting office 
report on investment adviser regulation she said the agency would 
have to spend an additional 17 million 
in a report issued monday the gao the accounting arm of 
congress warned that investors may be lulled into a false sense of 
security because investment advisers must register with the sec 
although the agency does not evaluate adviser competence 
the gao study noted that since 1980 the number of investment 
advisers has tripled to about 14000 while assets they manage have 
increased from 440 billion 10 years ago to about 46 trillion 
today 
the gao also found the sec was behind in reviewing registered 
advisers when advisers are reviewed usually only inadequate 
disclosure or recordkeeping problems are uncovered and the sec 
does little to ensure that deficiencies are corrected the report 
said 
sec oversight provides investors little assurance that the 
information they receive from advisers is accurate or that advisers 
operate in accordance with the law according to the gao study 
the gao recommended that the sec inspect all newly registered 
advisers within a year and periodically thereafter 
the sec however noted that to implement the reports 
recommendations would require tripling the 53person staff now 
devoted to investment adviser review 
ms schapiro began her testimony by defending the secs track 
record and noting the gao report said virtually all of its 
important recommendations for a more effective adviser regulatory 
program could only be implemented in the commissioner were given 
significant additional resources

the makers of dilantin epilepsy 
medication knew the drug could cause birth defects in pregnant 
women but failed to warn doctors a superior court jury ruled 
the jury on wednesday ordered parke davis co to pay 20 million 
to michael and brian keenan who were born mentally retarded in 
july 1978 after their mother took the medication while pregnant 
parke davis knew or should have know about the propensity of 
the drugs to cause these defects but failed to warn the medical 
community and in fact suppressed the information said max 
wistow the familys lawyer 
the boys now 12 live with their parents in seekonk mass he 
said their father richard is a construction worker and their 
mother sandra is a teaching assistant he said she no longer 
takes the medication 
he described the children as mildly retarded but said there 
was doubt they would ever be able to live independently most of 
their damage is mental but the boys also have some facial 
deformity he said 
we were able to show that in the medical literature through 
the world there was evidence that dilantin caused birth defects 
wistow said parke davis had access to this information and 
indeed had it and wasnt passing it on to physicians through 
package inserts 
joseph kelly the attorney for parke davis could not be reached 
for comment late wednesday telephone calls were not answered at 
his home or office 
he argued during the trial that there was a great deal of 
controversy over whether the drug caused birth defects and that the 
benefits of the medication outweighed any risks according to 
wistow the company also maintained the warnings were adequate 
wistow said 
the lawsuit also named pawtucket memorial hospital as a 
defendant claiming it had some knowledge of the potential danger 
and failed to convey it but the jury exonerated the hospital 
the jury deliberated for almost three days before returning to 
judge john p bourciers chamber it awarded 2 million in 
compensatory damages and 49 million in putative damages to each 
child it also ordered 6 million in interest on the compensatory 
damage awards 
the keenans have a 15yearold daughter who is healthy wistow 
said 
obviously after eight weeks we are gratified to see the jury 
accepted our position said wistow

a long island woman is suing the makers 
of the antidepressant drug prozac for 150 million claiming the 
drug caused her to mutilate her own body and to attempt suicide 
rhonda hala of shirley charged in her suit that the 
manufacturer eli lilly amp co of indianapolis failed to warn users 
that prozac could cause an obsession with death and violence 
there are about 15 million people in the united states on 
prozac with 650000 prescriptions written each month an eli lilly 
spokeswoman marie abbot said the company is not removing prozac 
from the market and said it has not been shown that the drug causes 
suicidal thoughts 
mrs hala began taking prozac in 1988 after a spinal disc 
procedure and withdrawal from painkillers left her depressed 
within two weeks she said her thoughts turned to suicide 
during her 18 months on prozac she slashed her arms legs and 
stomach with razor blades and dug scissors and screws into her 
flesh about 150 times she said 
i thought i had someone elses brain in my body said mrs 
hala 40 a school secretary 
she tried six times to kill herself requiring hospitalization 
four times her husband and two teenage children were afraid to 
leave her alone 
it was as if i was possessed said mrs hala i was always 
a happy up person but i became obsessed with selfmutilation 
as her mental state deteriorated her psychiatrist doubled her 
dose of prozac it was not until he read an article in the american 
journal of psychiatry that he immediately took mrs hala off the 
drug and her life returned to normal 
in the february article dr martin teicher of harvard 
university and his colleagues reported that six patients had 
developed violent suicidal thoughts within weeks of taking prozac 
officials at eli lilly and the federal food and drug 
administration which approved prozac in 1988 acknowledge 
nationwide reports of serious adverse effects from the drug 
including suicidal ideation 
but they said it may be impossible to determine if the drug 
directly caused the suicidal thoughts or if they were the result 
of the patients mental depressed state 
the idea that prozac is a killer drug is a little bit silly 
said psychiatrist dr jerrold rosenbaum chief of the 
psychopharmacology unit at massachusetts general hospital in 
boston and associate professor at harvard university 
the bottom line is that prozac is no wonder drug it has no 
extravagant claims attached to it but it has helped a lot of 
people suffering from depression appreciate the benefits of life 
rosenbaum said 
prozacs known side effects include nausea a rash agitation 
and jittery nerves 
in the last year various prozac support groups have been formed 
by former users of the drug to publicize their claims of side 
effects 
this is a terrible drug said sharyn digeronimo a selden 
resident who founded prozac survivors support group in new york 
digeronimo said she receives calls from prozac patients who 
report of loosing control or judgement while on the drug some were 
prescribed prozac to help them stop smoking or loose weight 
abbot the eli lilly spokeswoman declined comment on the 
litigation but acknowledged the company revised its package 
literature on prozac last may 
the update listed adverse effects reported to the company since 
prozac went on the market including suicidal ideation or 
thoughts associated with the drug 
suicidal thoughts are unfortunately common among depressive 
patients abbot said it is important to note that there has 
been no causeeffect relationship established between prozac and 
the reports of suicidal ideation 
dr paul leber director of the fdas neuropharmocological 
products department said the agency has been monitoring the 
reports of suicidal or homicidal thoughts 
we have taken a good hard look and havent found anything 
that leads us to believe that prozac causes suicidal thoughts 
said leber

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan says 
he is ready to support a big deficitreduction package by lowering 
interest rates but some private economists wonder whether that 
means the fed is giving up its battle to control inflation 
greenspan told congress on wednesday that a major cut in the 
budget deficit is unquestionably the right thing to do he said 
the central bank stands ready to counteract any adverse impact that 
would occur from implementing a 50 billion package of spending 
cuts and tax increases at a time when economic growth is very weak 
the administration which has been pressuring the fed for months 
to reduce interest rates immediately welcomed greenspans comments 
as very supportive of president bushs efforts to get a budget 
agreement with congress 
however some private economists expressed concern that 
greenspans statements coming on a day when the government 
reported a worrisome 05 percent increase in consumer prices in 
june would spook financial markets by signaling that the fed was 
no longer concerned about controlling inflation 
greenspan apparently has decided that it is more important to 
keep the economy out of a recession than it is to fight 
inflation said michael evans head of a washington forecasting 
firm 
evans said greenspans decision to relent in the feds inflation 
battle with prices still rising at an uncomfortable clip would turn 
out to be a mistake and require even higher interest rates later to 
bring inflation under control 
it is bad for the economy it will make inflation worse and in 
the long run that could lead to the very recession he is trying to 
avoid evans said 
however other economists said greenspan was trying to walk a 
difficult line between being supportive of deficitcutting efforts 
while still maintaining vigilance against inflation 
greenspan is walking a tightrope said david wyss an 
economist with drimcgraw hill inc inflation is not going away 
but the fed clearly wants to support the budget negotiations 
for his part greenspan tempered his pledge of support for a 
budget accord by insisting that the budget package would have to 
offer a credible package of deficit cuts 
he also insisted there was no danger that the nation was about 
to topple into a recession and therefore the central bank had no 
plans for an immediate followup on the small dose of credit easing 
taken last friday 
at that time the fed supplied enough additional cash to the 
banking system to push a key interest rate the federal funds rate 
down from 825 percent to 8 percent the first decline since last 
december 
the drop in this rate which banks charge each other for 
overnight loans triggered a big rally on wall street pushing the 
stock market to record highs as investors expressed hope that 
further rate declines would be forthcoming 
greenspan in his testimony wednesday confirmed that the fed had 
eased slightly last week he said the action was taken to offset 
the effects of banks becoming overly cautious in making loans 
based on his comments many analysts predicted that the fed 
would push the federal funds rate down by another 025 percentage 
point perhaps by labor day if congress and the administration have 
agreed on the outlines of a deficitcutting package by then 
for his part greenspan told members of the senate banking 
committee i can only offer the assurance that the federal 
reserve will act as it has in the past to endeavor to keep the 
economic expansion on track 
his statements came as part of his midyear report on the state 
of the economy 
in its economic outlook the fed said it expected the economy to 
grow at a modest rate of between 175 percent and 25 percent in 
1991 lower than the administrations forecast monday of 29 
percent growth 
in assessing current developments greenspan said the country 
had an economy which is not on the edge of either falling apart 
into a recession or about to take on highly inflationary 
characteristics

the federal trade commission says health 
warnings on alcohol advertisements could help curb drinking 
problems but its not endorsing a bill to require the labels 
janet d steiger ftc chairwoman told a house panel wednesday 
that requiring advertising warnings like the labels now required 
on alcohol cans and bottles can be an effective component of a 
multifaceted effort against alcohol abuse 
the beer and alcohol industry is waging a strong fight against 
legislation sponsored by rep joseph kennedy dmass and sen 
albert gore dtenn that would require five rotating health 
warnings on beer wine and liquor ads including television 
commercials 
steiger said the evidence is inconclusive whether 
advertising encourages alcohol consumption 
the decision whether to require the proposed rotating health 
warnings in alcohol advertisements is a question of public policy 
that is most appropriately decided by the united states congress 
she said 
kennedy told a hearing of the house energy and commerce 
subcommittee on transportation tourism and hazardous materials 
that beer and other alcoholic beverage ads glamorize drinking and 
are aimed at young people 
rep jim slattery dkan criticized the beer industry for 
aiming its advertising at young people to make his point he 
displayed a magazine ad for bud lite beer featuring the brands dog 
mascot sporting sunglasses and a guitar beneath the headline 
play that funky music spuds boy 
somebody has got to put pressure on the industry to be more 
responsible slattery said 
steiger responded that the ftc was assessing whether beer 
producers were violating federal laws including the prohibition on 
unfair and deceptive advertising but she refused to reveal what 
might come of that investigation or any private conversations 
between the ftc and the industry 
alcohol beverage producers spend more than 2 billion a year on 
advertising and promotion in the united states according to ftc 
figures 
the bill would require five rotating warnings with messages that 
drinking during pregnancy may cause birth defects that drinking 
and driving is dangerous that drinking may become addictive and 
that its illegal to buy alcohol for people younger than 21 
opposing the bill james c sanders president of the beer 
institute told the panel in written testimony that advertising 
doesnt cause alcohol abuse and that warnings may be 
counterproductive he said the brewing industry is trying to fight 
alcohol abuse with advertising that urges responsible drinking 
tony debevc of chalet debonne vineyards in ohio representing 
the association of american vintners said the warnings would 
impose a burden on small wineries that rely on promotional displays 
and brochures for both large and small producers he said the 
warning on ads will have the effect of reducing consumption and 
thus income

president bush and congressional leaders say 
they will continue their longrunning effort to reach a budget 
deal despite a high hurdle house republicans have flung in their 
path 
bush and leaders of the house and senate met privately wednesday 
for 90 minutes at the white house both sides said they had made no 
significant progress in their hunt for 50 billion worth of 
spending cuts and tax increases for next year 
but they said they would meet again monday and that other 
meetings between white house staff and lawmakers would be held over 
the next few days 
a lot of work still to be done bush told reporters 
afterward 
earlier wednesday rebellious house republicans voted informally 
to oppose any new taxes as part of a deficitreduction package 
participants in the closeddoor meeting said the nonbinding 
resolution passed by a 21 margin 
this put them in awkward counterpoint to bush who last month 
abandoned his 1988 campaign pledge to reject increased levies but 
gop lawmakers insisted their beef was with democrats who they 
accused of repeatedly opposing efforts to rein federal spending 
today we sent a message to congressional democrats that if 
they want to raise taxes they can do it without us said rep 
richard armey rtexas who sponsored the resolution 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said lawmakers and bush 
had agreed that the republican vote would not halt the budget 
summit which has been under way for more than two months 
our decision is to go forward and attempt to reach an 
agreement foley told reporters we will not be derailed in our 
effort to reach an agreement 
the democrats reiterated their demand that any budget package 
written by negotiators must be approved by a majority of both 
parties in the house and senate 
the gop resolution singled out senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine for special vilification 
mitchell has abandoned the summit goals and emerged as a 
consistent roadblock to real spending cuts or growth incentives 
and has championed tax increases at every turn the document said 
congressional officials speaking on condition they not be 
identified said armey inserted the clause after reading his 
original draft which did not mention mitchell to white house 
chief of staff john sununu 
sununu said the resolution should attack mitchell the sources 
said last week the majority leader said he would reject a cut in 
the capital gains tax unless income tax rates on the wealthy are 
increased bush is a staunch advocate of reducing the levy on 
capital gains profits from the sale of investments 
mitchell had little to say about his mention in the gop 
resolution 
saying he was quoting abraham lincoln he said but for the 
honor i would decline 
attending the white house meeting were bush foley sununu 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo senate minority 
leader bob dole rkan house minority leader robert michel 
rill white house budget director richard darman and treasury 
secretary nicholas brady 
on monday the white house estimated that the budget gap in 
fiscal 1991 which starts oct 1 will reach 1688 billion and 
tens of billions more if the counts of the savings and loan rescue 
are counted 
the grammrudman law sets a shortfall target for next year of 
64 billion the law will trigger automatic spending cuts of more 
than 100 billion unless a budget pact is reached 
lawmakers from the two parties have been meeting separately 
since last week trying to put together packages of spending cuts 
and tax increases that could be advanced at the talks as offers

a teamsters union threat to call a 
nationwide strike against united parcel service of america inc 
marks the second round of difficult contract negotiations between 
the two sides in less than a decade 
the union said it may strike if a new threeyear contract isnt 
approved by july 31 the day the old threeyear pact expires a ups 
spokesman said wednesday 
we have been informed by the union leadership that if it is 
rejected that is their intent said the spokesman ken sternad 
we think weve made a very good offer 
sternad said 140000 to 150000 parttime and fulltime ups 
employees are teamsters members the company employs 230000 
workers 
repeated calls to the teamsters union office in washington 
dc and the local office were not returned 
when the deadline passed during national negotiations in 1982 
and talks were extended ups informed its customers that it would 
stop picking up packages said paul r schlesinger an analyst with 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp in new york 
it was in essence a lockout the teamsters quickly got 
rightthinking and there was a settlement schlesinger said 
he said a strike wasnt likely partly because both sides would 
have too much to lose 
the teamsters have the ability to hurt ups badly ups has the 
ability to take the teamsters out completely he said adding 
that there are more teamsters at ups than at any other company 
ballots were mailed during the weekend so union members could 
vote on the proposed contract sternad said 
he said the proposal calls for higher wages improved benefits 
and better working conditions adding that the union members are 
already the highest paid of any teamsters in the country 
ups is the worlds no 1 package delivery service it made 28 
billion deliveries last year for a record 124 billion in revenue 
there has never been a national strike against ups which has 
had a national teamsters contract since 1979 but scattered work 
stoppages have occurred sternad said 
the last and biggest one was in 1976 when 18000 workers in 15 
northeastern states walked out for 13 weeks 
the proposed contract would raise the wages for the average ups 
fulltime driver to 18 an hour within two years sternad said ups 
drivers now make an average of 1610 per hour he said 
parttime workers mostly package handlers and truck loaders 
currently start at 8 or 9 an hour under the proposed contract 
their wages would go up 150 an hour he said 
company contributions for health benefits and employees 
pensions currently at 8300 a year for fulltime workers would 
increase to 10500 by the end of the three years sternad said 
for parttime workers the rate would increase by 105 an hour 
the proposal also offers a onetime bonus to be paid within the 
first month of ratification of 1000 to fulltimers and 500 to 
parttimers he said 
if the workers were to strike customers could turn to the us 
postal service federal express roadway package system and other 
package delivery companies analysts said but opinions were mixed 
as to whether those services could handle upss business 
ups handles 10 million pieces a day schlesinger said 
theres no way 10 million packages a day are going to be handled 
by the competitors 
however kevin murphy an analyst with morgan stanley amp co in 
new york said other package delivery services would be able to 
pick up the slack 
the world could live without united parcel it wouldnt live 
as well but it could live without them murphy said 
tony robertson an analyst with alex brown amp sons inc of 
baltimore said in the event of a strike ups would lose some 
business to its competitors but not much 
my guess is a certain percentage of air customers and ground 
customers would never come back robertson said i think any 
sort of disruption is going to cost ups some market share 
sternad said no decision has been made about whether ups would 
hire replacement workers if the union was to strike

chicagos mercantile exchange and board of trade 
have urged other exchanges to join them in endorsing a panels 
recommendation for expanded use of trading halts to curb market 
volatility 
the merc and the board of trade on wednesday jointly proposed 
revising their circuit breakers and procedures on stock index 
futures 
circuit breakers halt trading when certain triggers are reached 
they are usually keyed to movement in the dow jones industrial 
average 
the revised circuit breakers modify existing price limits on 
both the merc and the board of trade which since 1988 have been 
set in coordination with the new york stock exchange the nyse 
calculates its circuit breakers based on the dow jones industrial 
average 
in june an 18member new york stock exchange panel proposed 
halting trading for an hour when the dow moves up or down 100 
points from the previous days close 90 minutes when it moves 200 
points and two hours when it moves 300 points 
the longer halts are designed to give market participants more 
time to react 
the merc and the board of trade also endorsed a recommendation 
calling on other securities securities options and futures 
exchanges to adopt these coordinated circuit breakers 
the new york panel was formed after the 190point plunge by the 
dow on oct 13 1989 
the proposed revised circuit breakers need final approval of the 
commodities futures trading commission and are conditional on 
acceptance of the longer halts by the nyse and other exchanges 
in the meantime the merc and the board of trade will maintain 
their daily stock index futures price limits

stc plc the parent company of britains biggest 
computer maker today said it was negotiating the sale of a 
majority stake in its computer arm to japans leading computer 
manufacturer fujitsu ltd 
such a stake in the subsidiary international computers ltd or 
icl would give fujitsu a major foothold in europe ahead of the 
creation of the single european market in 1992 while offering icl 
security for the future analysts said 
stc formerly known as standard telephones and cables confirmed 
the negotiations after fujitsu president tadashi sekizawa said 
earlier in tokyo that his company was considering purchasing an 
interest in icl but that nothing has been decided yet 
newspaper reports in britain and japan have said fujitsu would 
acquire 50 percent to 60 percent of icls equity for about 650 
million pounds or about 12 billion 
icl is worth about 12 billion pounds or 22 billion analysts 
estimate 
there have been rumors for a year about a possible equity tie 
between icl and fujitsu which already have technology links 
london analysts said 
but analysts said they were surprised that stc might sell a 
controlling stake to the japanese company such a deal could 
inflame nationalist sentiment which frequently meets foreign bids 
in britain 
this is a significant event said andrew harrington an 
analyst at the london investment firm barclays de zoete wedd ltd 
icl is the most profitable computer company of its kind in 
europe analysts said it makes mainframe computers mostly for the 
british market 
fujitsus major activity in europe is selling semiconductor 
computer chips although it makes office computers in spain and 
semiconductors in ireland it has marketing and development arms in 
britain west germany and the netherlands 
icl uses fujitsus computer chips and disks given those ties 
fujitsu is the only company that could take control of icl said an 
analyst who requested anonymity 
they are the brains in icls mainframe computers she said 
technologically they are vital to the future of icl 
stc chairman alan walsh said earlier this year that his company 
was looking for a partner to help carry the burden of heavy 
research and development costs associated with the rapidly changing 
computer industry 
icls operating profit increased 13 percent to 146 million 
pounds or 266 million from 129 million pounds or 235 million 
last year its sales were up 18 percent to 161 billion pounds 
29 billion from 136 billion pounds or 25 billion stc said 
aftertax profit figures were not available 
despite icls healthy 1989 performance stc issued a profit 
warning in june the parent company said it anticipated a sluggish 
market due to launch costs of new icl products and key customers 
deferring capital purchases

east german industrial production plunged by 
15 percent in june and half a million workers have had their hours 
and wages slashed in the past two weeks the government said today 
more than 700000 workers now have either lost their jobs or 
faced sharp cuts in their salaries because of the countrys quick 
move to a free market the government said 
lawmakers debated how to keep financing the country until 
unification with west germany as more than 2000 uniformed police 
officers demonstrated outside the parliament to demand better wages 
about 500000 east german workers have had their hours reduced 
since july 1 when the nation merged its economy with west 
germanys in a step to full unification said east germanys labor 
minister regine hildebrandt 
under a program financed by west germany workers who normally 
would be targeted for layoffs are being paid about 60 percent of 
their salaries to remain in the factories where they are to 
receive training for other jobs 
on wednesday the government announced that unemployment was at 
223876 about 27 percent of the 8 million east german workers 
that was up from 30000 jobless in march 
together the number of workers who have either lost their jobs 
or are in the subsidized jobs program is nearly 724000 or about 9 
percent of the work force 
the government statistics office announced today that production 
was down 151 percent in june from the same time a year earlier 
and down 73 percent during the first six months of this year 
compared with the same period last year 
economists say unemployment could reach 3 million within a year 
as uncompetitive east german companies go bankrupt unable to make 
the adjustment from a centrally planned ecomomy to a free market 
on tuesday the government said 2400 of the countrys 8000 
companies 30 percent are unable to pay their bills 
the two germanys joined their economies and monetary systems on 
july 1 and are expected to merge into one nation by the end of the 
year 
arno donda statistics office chief also said that living costs 
for east germans rose 121 percent in june compared to june 1989 
the figure does not cover the economic union that began july 1 
when east germanys borders were opened to western products and 
many prices for basic necessities skyrocketed 
about 2500 east german police demonstrated in front of the 
parliament building to demand job security and better wages to keep 
up with higher living costs they also said they need more money 
for their expanded duties including dealing with rising crime 
the east berlin newspaper berliner zeitung reported today that 
crime has risen since east germany threw off its communist 
government last fall embraced democracy and opened its borders to 
the west 
about 130000 robberies breakins and larcenies were reported 
from january to june a 62 percent increase from the same period 
in the previous year

supporters of federal crop insurance for 
farmers are looking for ways to save the program despite 
elimination of its funding for fiscal 1991 by the house 
rep glenn english dokla assailed the chairman of the house 
appropriations committee for cutting the programs money from the 
5035 billion agriculture spending bill that the house approved 
33586 wednesday 
he said the action by rep jamie whitten dmiss posed a 
direct threat to the economic well being of farmers of this 
nation 
but neither english who chairs the house agriculture 
subcommittee studying ways to improve crop insurance nor any other 
proponents tried to amend the bill on the floor 
agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas said 
he thought farmers would get the wrong signal from the bill 
crop insurance has become a tool of the new farming era 
said de la garza he said many farmers cant get loans to do their 
planting without the insurance 
rep edward madigan rill ranking republican on the 
agriculture committee said crop insurance would be saved somehow 
in the farm bill we can do something to offset what whitten 
has done he said it would be easier than to fight with him on 
the floor 
he also indicated that the appropriations bill might be adjusted 
by the senate to reinstate crop insurance 
the appropriations committee cut the amount available to the 
crop insurance program by 337 million and instructed the 
agriculture department not to sell any new policies after sept 10 
a total 262 million was appropriated for phaseout costs and to 
make payments on policies that are being written now and until the 
cutoff date 
the bush administration also opposes the program and has said 
601 million would be needed in 1991 to operate at the current 
level spending for 1990 has been 400 million 
the alternative to crop insurance is straightout disaster 
payments which congress has regularly made when multistate 
weather problems cause extensive crop losses 
only about 40 percent of the eligible farmers are participating 
in the insurance program farmers who dont buy it say its premiums 
are too high yields are inadequate and price forecasting for 
certain crops by insurance companies is inaccurate 
insurance policies can be purchased through private companies or 
the federal government thirty percent of all costs are paid for by 
the government 
whitten objected to the program as unsuccessful and costly 
we have a long record of trying to work out an actuarially 
sound crop insuranc program he said i dont know if that can 
be done or not the big money goes to those engaged in the 
insurance business 
whittens stronginterest in agriculture and his 41year tenure 
as chairman of the agriculture appropriations subcommittee has made 
him a powerful force in american farming whose wishes are not 
easily challenged 
five efforts to cut his bills spending across the board were 
defeated debate over one of them offered by republicans to rib 
the democrats degenerated into partisan accusations about the 
federal deficit 
rep robert walker rpa sought an amendment to cut 1990 frm 
the bill after four others that would have skimmed 2 percent to 95 
percent from all programs covered by the legislation were defeated 
minority whip newt gingrich rga acknowledged that the walker 
amendment was a joke offered in reaction to house defeat tuesday of 
a constitutional amendment to balance the budget 
walker said if in 1990 we can cut 1990 then next year we 
can muster the courage to go to 1991 
the comments led rep david obey dwis to charge that the 
republicans caused the deficit problems 
when poor old beleaguered jimmy carter left office the 
national debt was 932 billion said obey the national debt 
today is 338 trillion it has been tripled because this congress 
gutlessly and spinelessly followed the policies of the reagan 
administration and its successor 
the overall agriculture appropriation for fiscal 1991 which 
begins oct 1 is 52 billion more than this years funding but 
865 million less than requested by the administration 
i just cant understand the efforts to cut said whitten 
i get asked about the balanced budget i advise that i believe in 
the balanced budget but not at the expense of sound programs that 
are absolutely essential to the wellbeing of the american people 
the measure provides money for the agriculture department 
administrative operations research projects price supports rural 
development domestic food assistance and international programs 
the bill also funds the food and drug administration and commodity 
futures trading commission

among its aerospace technology companies its systems segment

percent to 1383 million or 153 per share on revenue of 39 
billion for the first half of 1989 income was 1226 million or

the united auto workers union will press 
automakers for better jobprotection guarantees than they agreed to 
in 1987 uaw president owen bieber says 
since the current agreements with the big three were signed two 
of the companies have halted production at six assembly plants 
putting about 17000 people out of work 
those closings what the companies call indefinite idlings 
are among the reasons the union has tapped job security as its no 
1 priority in this summers negotiations with general motors corp 
ford motor co and chrysler corp 
as talks opened this morning at ford company vice president 
peter pestillo reached across the bargaining table with two fingers 
bandaged to shake hands with bieber 
pestillo pleaded with the 6foot5 250pound bieber to squeeze 
lightly explaining his dog was hit by a car and the animal bit 
pestillo when he went to its aid he didnt say how the dog was 
before reporters were ushered from the room to allow talks to begin 
talks started wednesday at gm and get under way friday at 
chrysler 
the contracts cover more than 450000 active workers and nearly 
as many retirees 
all three contracts expire at midnight sept 14 its the first 
time thats happened in 11 years 
besides job security the union will seek recalls for laid off 
workers wage and pension improvements more accountability from 
management and a linking of executives bonus payments to 
profitsharing awards for hourly workers 
the companies are expected to press for increased flexibility in 
work assignments and a variety of costreduction issues including 
healthcare which is likely to take up a good deal of bargaining 
time 
after a brief preliminary meeting between the full company and 
union bargaining committees at the gm building on wednesday bieber 
sharply criticized the huge automaker for performing the cynical 
semantic maneuver represented by the term idling plants 
we told the corporation that disappointment is far too mild a 
word to describe our feelings about how they perceived their job 
security commitments they made to us three years ago he said 
gms chief negotiator vice president alfred warren jr 
declined to get into a discussion about specific issues likely to 
command time at the main bargaining table or in smaller 
issueoriented subcommittees 
however he referred frequently to gms need to cut costs 
especially in its component operations 
we must find innovative and costeffective ways to become more 
competitive in component manufacturing he said 
gm has about 40 percent of its 280000 active uawcovered 
employees working in component plants which make for example 
airconditioning systems radios and transmissions gm makes more 
of the components that go into its cars and trucks than do ford or 
chrysler and it sells components to other manufacturers 
warren declined to say how gm thought it could become more 
competitive with other component manufacturers but said 
competition dictated that it must 
each of the big three have said the age of their work forces at 
an average of about 42 years coupled with uawnegotiated 
healthcare provisions boost the price of each car 
warren said company provided healthcare benefits add 622 to 
the cost of every car and truck gm sells such costs for japanese 
companies making vehicles in the united states with an average 
worker age of younger than 30 are between 50 and 100 
one of the most emotional issues on the uaw side of the talks is 
costofliving protection for retirees 
at a demonstration outside the gm building on wednesday about 
2000 protesters sought a contract provision linking pension 
payments to inflation 
such a proposal the company and union have said could cost 
billions of dollars perhaps more than the rest of a contract 
combined 
its more likely that the two sides can reach agreements on 
lumpsum payments to retirees rather than tying pension boosts to 
increases in the inflation rate

american telephone amp telegraph co today 
reported its secondquarter earnings fell 64 percent due to lower 
equipment sales and unexpectedly high startup costs for the 
companys new credit card 
atampt warned of an expected drop in earnings in an unusual 
announcement three weeks ago but it did not say how much it would 
be 
atampt said it earned 657 million or 60 cents a share in the 
quarter ended june 30 down from 699 million or 65 cents a share 
in the same quarter of 1989 
revenue also fell to 903 billion from 926 billion in the 
same quarter of last year 
the company said the disappointing results were due mostly to 
slower sales of corporate telephone systems data communications 
gear and equipment sold to the federal government as well as 
unexpectedly high costs for processing applications for its 
universal card which combines a mastercard or visa with telephone 
charging privileges 
atampt blamed the lower equipment sales on a sluggish economy 
while it said the universal card proved far more popular than it 
expected 
it also said its longdistance revenue was down in the quarter 
due to less favorable access charge settlements with local phone 
companies and customer shifts to lowercost atampt services 
we still expect 1990 to be better than 1989 a record earnings 
year said chairman robert e allen these results do not alter 
our confidence in our direction or our future prospects 
for the first six months of the year atampt earned 1325 
billion or 122 per share up from 1293 billion or 120 a 
share revenue totaled 179 billion virtually unchanged from the 
same period of 1989 
atampts announcement last month of expected lower earnings sent 
its stock price tumbling atampt is the nations most widely held 
stock 
in early trading today atampt shares were off 25 cents at 3687

if argentina placed a classified 
ad heres how it might look buyers wanted for used planes 
trains roads power plants and a phone company for information 
contact president carlos menem 
dozens of inefficient businesses industries and monopolies 
created by the government or nationalized decades ago are now up 
for grabs in what amounts to a largescale closeout sale theyre 
worth many billions of dollars 
in late june the government peddled a majority stake in the 
telephone company entel leased more than 6000 miles of federal 
highways and granted foreign companies access to potentially rich 
oil fields other items on the forsale agenda range from radio 
stations to gambling casinos 
under menem the reformminded leader who took office a year 
ago the staterun bureacracy that has dominated argentinas 
economy since the 1940s is redefining its role and stepping back 
the main reason is that the once prosperous south american 
nation is undergoing recession high unemployment and tripledigit 
inflation all at the same time its foreign debt of 66 billion is 
thirdhighest in the developing world the government is bankrupt 
argentina is not well argentina is broken menem said when 
inaugurated last july at this historic time begins the 
reconstruction 
as he said little about it in his campaign few argentines 
suspected menem had in mind selling companies taken over by his 
partys founder juan domingo peron beginning in the 1940s 
but menem concluded the entities that once were an economic 
engine had become an anchor which he is trying to cut loose 
oil production stagnated in the 1980s because the state company 
ypf lacked money and technology promising areas were never 
explored potentially an exporter argentina barely produces enough 
for domestic needs 
onethird of the state highway system of 14670 miles is in 
marginal shape or worse government assessments show private 
studies say half the roads need basic repairs 
forty percent of the locomotives are out of service at any given 
time the state train company ferrocarriles argentinos admits 
nearly half the track is so worn that train engineers creep over it 
slowly to avoid derailment 
argentines wait years to get a new telephone line only to find 
its impossible to call another city because of jammed circuits 
within buenos aires calls frequently are misdirected callers 
often cannot hear each other and sometimes they dont get a dial 
tone the system is in collapse said entel director maria 
julia alsogaray 
by all accounts staterun companies are poorly managed 
overstaffed and strangled in bureaucracy and petty corruption 
strikers often shut them down 
fares go uncollected on state trains employees of the state 
water and electricity companies get service at a discount 
politicians receive free tickets on the state airline 
the 13 biggest staterun companies which ring up huge debts 
among themselves lost nearly 4 billion in 1989 enough to pay off 
a sizable chunk of foreign debt 
buenos aires once known as one of the loveliest and most 
sophisticated capitals is getting a reputation for third world 
deprivation the city of 10 million rationed energy last year when 
drought shriveled production at alreadyoverburdened hydroelectric 
complexes 
among other problems labor unions are intransigent courts are 
too overworked to adequately enforce contracts and markets are so 
volatile that currency and interest rates seesaw daily 
so who would want to buy argentinas companies surprisingly 
bidders abound 
bell atlantic corp of the united states and telefonica of spain 
bought a controlling stake of entel by offering 214 million cash 
and 5 billion in debt securities they hope new investment and 
tighter accounting will pay off the government will sell the 
balance of the company later this year 
about 50 argentine and foreign companies agreed to improve 
nearly 6200 miles of federal highways in return for the right to 
charge tolls 
the state carrier aerolineas argentinas fetched 260 million

sharply lower sales during the past 
three months cut hasbro incs secondquarter profit nearly 52 
percent from the comparable period a year earlier the company 
reported today 
the pawtucketbased toy maker earned 87 million or 15 cents 
per share from april through june this year compared to 181 
million or 31 cents per share during the same three months of 
1989 
that was because of dismal revenue of about 2773 million 
during this years second quarter down 78 percent from the year 
earliers 3013 million 
some expenses also rose this year contributing to the poor 
results those expenses included such things as research and 
product development the cost of sales and distribution and 
administration 
hasbro blamed the poor performance on slow domestic sales 
while our european units are enjoying continued strong levels of 
revenues and earnings both in us dollars and their local 
currencies our domestic units have not fared as well alan g 
hassenfeld chairman and chief executive officer said in a 
statement 
the company is banking on improvements during the third quarter 
primarily because of the planned introductions of two new products 
those are dolls based on the pop music group new kids on the block 
and on performers affiliated with the world wrestling federation 
if anticipated improvements in customer order trends in the 
second half of the year occur and there is a positive response to 
new promotionsl products being shipped in the third quarter we 
believe 1990 fullyear results will approximate those of 1989 
hassenfeld said 
for the first six months of this year earnings plummetted 236 
percent to 282 million or 48 cents per share from 369 
million or 63 cents per share that was based on revenue of 5784 
million for the first half of this year compared to 5897 million 
last year 
hasbros announcement of its poor performance comes on the heels 
of a lawsuit filed in us district court in which a shareholder 
complained that the company hid its declining sales to prop up its 
stock price 
frederic braunschweiger who filed his suit in providence said 
hasbro executives knew that orders from retailers were down from 
1989 and that the companys market share was dropping quickly but 
did not acknowledge that publicly until hassenfeld told the dow 
jones new service in an interview late last month 
if hasbro had disclosed its problems earlier investors would 
not have bought hasbro stock at the artificially inflated prices 
that they did braunschweiger charged in court documents

unisys corp today reported its 
secondquarter profit plunged and that it had a net loss per common 
share after paying preferred stock dividends 
the nations thirdlargest computer company blamed the results 
in part on weak domestic sales

mainframe computers the company said 
unisys stock was up 12 cents a share at 1275 this morning in 
new york stock exchange trading 
unisys said its worldwide orders posted a slight gain in the

series sales particularly abroad unisys said 
james a unruh unisys president and chief executive officer 
said the company was making gradual but steady progress in 
improving its business operations and financial structure 
the company reduced its debt by 265 million in the quarter

reducing its debt by 600 million to 800 million during 1990 
for the first six months of the year unisys said it earned 86 
million on revenue of 48 billion compared with a loss of 251 
million on virtually identical revenue a year ago the company

the typical cucumber is so caked with wax 
you could add a wick and almost call it a candle 
but its waxed foods that catch the eye of even the savviest 
shopper who will meticulously pick through produce for that 
picturepretty item leaving the duller but perhaps healthier 
alternative behind 
the wax itself isnt harmful what concerns people are 
pesticides and fungicides found in the wax 
some businesses have capitalized on this fear developing scrub 
products they claim will remove waxes and other chemicals from the 
surface of fruits and vegetables 
i was cleaning my produce at the kitchen sink using water when 
it dawned on me that if im going to invest my time washing i 
should at least be doing a thorough job said steve abo 
president of a los angeles company that markets a produce wash in 
spray bottles 
many consumers know that apples like cucumbers get much of 
their luster from wax what they may not realize is how many fresh 
produce items are coated with wax oranges grapefruits avocados 
bananas beets watermelons pineapples eggplants peaches 
peppers squash garlic onion potatoes tomatoes and turnips 
even if there is no sheen a fruit or vegetable could still be 
covered wax is now applied in such a thin film that its hard to 
tell just by looking about 10000 apples can be coated with a 
single ounce 
the wax replaces natural coatings removed by scrubs and 
detergent washes between picking and packing it keeps food from 
losing moisture and spoiling 
whats troubling is that fungicides some considered possible 
causes of cancer are encased in the wax said beth kaufman of the 
washingtonbased center for science in the public interest 
consumers look for the prettiest vegetable or fruit which is 
usually waxed kaufman said consumers have to let producers 
know theyre more concerned about the food than just how it looks 
abo who grew up on avocado and lemon farms in california and 
arizona said his product removes chemicals that dont wash off 
with water alone he wont disclose whats in his spray except to 
say the ingredients are nontoxic 
another company bio scrub industries near albany ny is 
planning to market a veggy fruit scrub brush which claims to 
remove surface wax soil chemicals and pesticides 
the product is a softbristle brush that emits a liquid 
containing purified water and cleaning agents it will be sold 
through mailorder catalogs and cost 845 per threepack said 
company president mark sterman 
consumer groups are skeptical the center for science in the 
public interest for example said the ingredients in these washes 
look suspiciously like those in ordinary dishwashing detergent 
were not convinced that specialty scrubs are any better than 
plain old detergent and they can cost up to eight times more 
said lisa lefferts a staff scientist at the center 
lefferts questioned whether these products will even remove wax 
as many claim 
abo a biochemist said he understands the centers position 
i think their angle is that theres a lot of entrepreneurs 
putting detergent in bottles diluting it and selling it he said 
the food and drug administration says fungicides approved for 
use with waxes are safe within certain limits 
but among those approved by the fda is benomyl considered a 
possible carcinogen in humans also included is orthophenylphenol 
an immunesystem suppressant and sodium orthophenyl phenate 
another possible carcinogen 
foodcoloring agents may be added a common practice for florida 
oranges which are often picked green some waxes are made with 
animal lard 
critics question the safety of fungicides particularly in 
combination with wax which keeps them bound to food 
while there is no reason to believe that waxes pose a health 
risk to humans there is reason to be concerned about the 
pesticides that are often mixed with waxes a number of fungicides 
that are added to waxes have been shown to cause increased risk of 
some diseases including cancer says the wax coverup a 
report issued this spring by the center for science in the public 
interest 
for more than 50 years federal law has required that shipping 
cartons and store labels disclose when wax is used another federal 
law adopted in the 1950s also requires disclosure of postharvest 
pesticides 
critics say these laws arent strictly followed and in some 
cases are ignored because the federal government relies on state 
inspectors to enforce them but some states are enacting their own 
tough labeling laws 
maine requires food retailers to post signs informing consumers 
that its produce may have been treated with chemicals the new 
hampshire legislature has passed a bill requiring labeling of 
produce coated with wax similar legislation is pending in 
illinois tennessee and new york 
efforts for tighter enforcement have upset growers however the 
united fresh fruit and vegetable association for example said 
labeling waxed produce is nearly impossible 
the group said different shipments of the same item which may 
be coated with different wax ingredients are often mixed together 
on supermarket shelves the association which represents producers 
nationwide said keeping the differently treated items separate is 
difficult 
health experts say consumers should scrub produce to remove 
residues and coatings the fresh fruit and vegetable association 
recommends using a vegetable brush hot water and detergent 
removing the peel will reduce exposure to wax and fungicide 
coatings but its a tradeoff since the peel contains fiber which 
may help reduce the risk of cancer 
health experts say organic fruits and vegetables are grown and 
treated without the use of synthetic chemicals and wax coatings are 
not applied

ralston purina co on thursday reported a 9 
percent quarterly profit gain reflecting lower costs for pet and 
human food ingredients combined with higher sales of cereals and 
strength in baked goods 
the company earned 924 million or 155 a share in its third 
quarter up from 838 million or 127 a share in the 
corresponding 1989 quarter 
for the three months ended june 30 the st louisbased company 
had sales of 171 billion up 5 percent from 162 billion for the 
same 1989 period 
company spokesman pat farrell said the increase stemmed largely 
from lower ingredient costs for pet and human foods higher sales 
of cereal and bigger profits in baked goods 
ralston purina is a leading maker of pet food and cereal the 
company also makes eveready and energizer batteries and owns 
continetal baking co which makes such wellknown products as 
wonder bread and hostess twinkies 
farrell said profits declined at eveready battery in the third 
quarter primarily because of lower sales and heavy discounting 
the company also noted in the second quarter report that it was 
increasing its stock repurchase program 
in march the company announced a plan to buy up to 2 million 
shares of its common stock and now says its authorized to buy an 
additional 521000 shares 
for the first nine months of the year the company reported 
income of 3143 million or 508 a share compared with 3773 
million or 575 a share for the same period a year earlier 
the decrease was a result of the absence of profits from the 
discontinued van camp seafood operations which ralston sold last 
year 
sales for the first nine months were 531 billion up from 
489 billion for the same period last year

a financially strapped commodity brokerage headed 
by chicago board of trade chairman karsten mahlmann said today it 
has tentatively accepted an investors offer to buy a substantial 
stake in the company 
the brokerage stotler and co also confirmed that it had 
brought itself into compliance with the federal governments 
minimum capital requirements 
the developments mean stotler could avert a cashflow crisis and 
will avoid restrictions on its brokerage operations while sparing 
mahlmann further embarrassment 
stotlers parent company chicagobased stotler group inc made 
the announcements in a onepage statement stotler and co an 
oldline graintrading firm is stotler groups principal 
subsidiary 
stotler group did not identify the prospective investor or the 
size of the stake the party would buy in the parent company 
the statement said the offer was subject to approval by the 
investors board of directors the offer would terminate if such 
approval is not granted by 11 am edt monday stotler group said 
stotler group confirmed wednesdays board of trade announcement 
that it had brought itself into compliance with the minimum capital 
requirements of the commodity futures trading commission 
in a threeparagraph statement released late wednesday the 
board of trade said stotler had given the exchange a plan last week 
for meeting a cftc requirement that futures brokerages maintain in 
a separate account liquid assets equal to 4 percent of customer 
funds 
the exchange believes the firm has achieved the requisite 
capital requirements the exchange said 
they have at all times during this period had more than enough 
in segregated liquid assets to cover all customer segregated fund 
obligations and the exchange is continuing to monitor the 
compliance status of stotler and all other member firms the 
statement concluded 
board of trade spokesman michael oconnell said he could not 
elaborate on the statement 
officials at stotler and its parent company stotler group inc 
did not return telephone calls 
the exchange ordered stotler on monday to boost its capital to 
the required level by the close of business wednesday or face 
restrictions on its trading activities 
the parent company said stotler would try to meet the capital 
requirement by both reducing the size of its business and seeking 
outside financial help without which it said stotler might have 
trouble meeting its debt obligations 
the exchange can force a brokerage out of the business of 
trading for customers if the capital level falls below 4 percent of 
customer funds 
stotler groups stock which trades on the american stock 
exchange closed unchanged at 562 wednesday 
stotlers capital problems are seen as a major embarrassment to 
mahlmann now in his fourth consecutive oneyear term as chairman 
of the worlds largest commodity futures exchange 
mahlmann has said he has not been involved in stotlers 
daytoday operations for several years 
people in the commodities business said wednesday that some of 
stotlers customers were liquidating their accounts wednesday and 
others were transferring to other brokerages but they couldnt 
provide specifics 
we dont see any of that on the floor because its all done in 
the back offices but it is going on said john frazier director 
of agricultural trading for gerald inc a commodity brokerage 
stotler one of the countrys 10 largest commodity brokerages 
is an oldline firm with its roots in the grain business the 
company also trades financial futures which have outstripped 
agricultural commodities in trading volume in recent years

there certainly are indications of progress there said 
lawrence eckenfelder an analyst with prudentialbache securities

that included 2000 layoffs consolidation of branch offices and 
departure from some business lines further reductions are expected

businesses of the lehman management co division to a subsidiary of 
salomon inc and a 9 million gain from the sale of a 50 percent 
interest in panagora asset management inc to nippon life insurance 
co 
shearson last month announced it was splitting into two 
divisions dropping the hutton name which it added after the 1988

claims by western commercial banks 
expanded by 98 percent on eastern europe last year and by 184 
percent on the soviet union according to a new survey released 
thursday 
the bank of international settlements survey said the banks 
claims including loans plus accrued interest on eastern europe 
went up by 33 billion during the julydecember period to 96 
billion following a 53 billion increase in the first half 
claims on the soviet union stood at 432 billion at the end of 
the year rising by 19 billion in the second half after 
increasing by 48 billion in the first half undisbursed credit 
commitments also continued to expand 
at the same time the soviet union drew down its deposits with 
the reporting western banks by 13 billion according to the 
survey 
the other major eastern european borrowers during the second 
half of 1989 were east germany at 800 million and czechoslovakia 
at 700 million claims on east germany totaled 17 billion and on 
czechoslovakia were 54 billion at the end of the year claims on 
hungary totaled 119 billion up 100 million and were 10 
billion on poland down 200 million 
lending to third world countries excluding opec members 
dropped by 92 billion to 3056 billion of these claims on 
latin american countries declined by 77 billion to 1761 
billion including a 33 billion decline in claims on brazil and a 
2 billion drop in claims on argentina 
the declines occurred in spite of the accumulation of interest 
arrears by these two countries and in the case of argentina an 
increase in claims on private nonbank entities the survey said 
the reduction in claims on brazil appears to have resulted partly 
from informal buybacks of official debt at secondary market 
discounts 
claims on mexico fell by 15 billion to 597 billion and 
claims on chile dropped 1 billion to 93 billion the survey said 
colombia borrowed 300 million after signing a new lending 
accord with creditor banks bringing total claims on that country 
to 63 billion 
claims on members of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries went up by 19 billion to 1015 billion including a 2 
billion increase for iraq and rises of 400 million each for 
algeria and iran

japans biggest computer maker fujitsu ltd is 
negotiating to buy a controlling stake in international computers 
ltd britains leading computer manufacturer icls parent said 
thursday 
a majority interest in icl likely to cost more than 1 billion 
would give fujitsu a bigger foothold in the european community 
before the trade bloc dismantles its internal trade barriers in 
1992 it also could offer icl security for the future analysts 
said 
a tieup has been expected for months but analysts said they 
were surprised that the parent company stc plc might sell control 
of icl to fujitsu 
icl is a major supplier of computer hardware to the ministry of 
defense and other government departments the idea of selling 
control to a foreign company has raised concerns about british jobs 
and national security 
lawmaker lewis moonie who serves as the opposition labor 
partys spokesman on technology matters said we are deeply 
concerned about the implications for the british computers 
industry for jobs and research 
larry broke national officer of the manufacturing science and 
finance workers union said on bbc radio we are probably going 
to witness the demise of britains last mainframe computer 
manufacturer 
broke said he would rather see british companies join european 
partners to create a strong european computer industry 
stc formerly known as standard telephones and cables confirmed 
the negotiations after fujitsu president tadashi sekizawa said 
earlier thursday in tokyo that his company was considering 
purchasing an interest in icl no decisions have yet been made he 
said 
newspapers in britain and japan have reported that fujitsu is to 
acquire 50 to 60 percent of icl for about 650 million pounds or 
12 billion at current exchange rates 
icl has a value of about 22 billion analysts estimate it 
employs 22000 people and is europes most profitable mainframe 
computer maker they said 
its operating profit increased 13 percent to about 266 million 
on an 18 percent gain in sales to 29 billion last year 
but stc has warned that this years performance might be 
adversely affected by launch costs of new icl products and key 
customers deferrals of capital purchases 
stcs shares rose the equivalent of 44 cents to 511 a share on 
londons stock exchange 
fujitsus major activity in europe is selling semiconductor 
computer chips although it makes office computers in spain and 
semiconductors in ireland it has marketing and development arms in 
britain west germany the netherlands and elsewhere 
rumors have circulated for about a year about a possible equity 
tie between icl and fujitsu which already have technology links 
under a 10year agreement signed in 1981 icl uses fujitsus 
computer chips and disks 
stc chairman alan walsh said earlier this year that his company 
was looking for a partner to help carry the burden of heavy 
research and development costs in the rapidly changing computer 
industry 
given the existing ties fujitsu was the only company that could 
take control of icl according to one london analyst who requested 
anonymity 
technologically they are vital to the future of icl she 
said

a commodities brokerage headed by chicago board 
of trade chairman karsten mahlmann may have found its financial 
savior according to an announcement thursday by the firms parent 
company 
stotler group inc said it had accepted an unidentified 
investors conditional offer to purchase a substantial equity 
interest in stotler group 
a onepage statement identifed neither the prospective investor 
nor the size of the stake it has offered to buy 
mahlmann is managing partner of stotler groups principal 
subsidiary stotler and co a large oldline trading company 
that recently ran afoul of the federal governments minimum capital 
requirements 
chicagobased stotler group a publicly traded company 
confirmed in the announcement that stotler and co had brought 
itself into compliance with the capital requirements 
the developments mean stotler could avert a cashflow crisis and 
will avoid restrictions on its brokerage operations while sparing 
mahlmann further embarrassment 
the statement said the offer announced thursday was subject to 
approval by the investors board of directors the deal will die if 
such approval is not granted by 11 am edt monday stotler group 
said 
stotler group confirmed wednesdays board of trade announcement 
that it had brought itself into compliance with a commodity futures 
trading commission rule requiring futures brokerages to maintain in 
a separate account liquid assets equal to 4 percent of customer 
funds 
on wednesday after a deadline set by the board of trade had 
passed the exchange released a statement saying it believes the 
firm has achieved the requisite capital requirements 
the exchange had ordered stotler to boost its capital or face 
restrictions on its trading activities the exchange can force a 
brokerage out of the business of trading for customers if its 
capital level falls below 4 percent of customer funds 
stotlers plan for bringing its capital level into compliance 
included trimming it customer base and finding an investor 
stotler group had said that without new capital from an outside 
source it might have trouble meeting its debt obligations 
stotler is one of the countrys 10 largest commodity brokerages 
with its roots in the grain business the company also trades 
financial futures which have outstripped agricultural commodities 
in trading volume in recent years

ford motor co indicated thursday it 
probably wouldnt eliminate plant overtime that the united auto 
workers claims is straining employees 
owen bieber president of the uaw said after opening contract 
talks with the automaker that ford was using extensive overtime so 
it could employ fewer hourly workers 
fords practice of running some of its plants at aboverated 
capacity is its relentless effort to squeeze out costs bieber 
said at a news conference after a ceremonial opening handshake with 
ford vice president peter pestillo 
uaw talks opened wednesday with general motors corp and begin 
friday at chrysler corp the three contracts expire at midnight 
sept 14 
at one point during the current threeyear contract with the 
uaw ford was running as much as 20 percent over factory capacity 
in order to deal with surging car and truck demand sales since 
then have weakened 
the union has complained that physical and psychological burdens 
on employees can result from such overwork extensive overtime also 
indicates the companys hourly work force is too small bieber said 
but uaw negotiators will have to negotiate the overtime issue 
gingerly many ford workers have become accustomed to regular 
overtime in their paychecks 
pestillo said ford would like to eliminate overtime in the 
plants but probably wont do it 
the big three are trying to prevent further erosion of their 
share of the us vehicle market to japanese companies they also 
are concerned about federal government mandates for better gas 
mileage and safety 
ford shut no plants during its current contract instead cutting 
back on overtime to reduce production 
when uaw signed the current gm contract in 1987 it touted 
jobprotection provisions allowing the automaker to close a plant 
only when sales of its products tumbled 
but gm stopped production at four plants saying they were 
indefinitely idled chrysler used the same contract provision 
to shut down two assembly plants a total of 17000 hourly jobs 
were lost 
ford last closed an assembly plant since 1983 when it shut its 
san jose calif car and truck plant during the boom years of the 
mid1980s ford paid overtime to keep the cars and trucks rolling 
out of existing plants 
the average wage for an assembly worker at the big three is just 
less than 15 an hour before overtime or benefits 
in addition to curbing overtime and protecting current jobs the 
union will seek higher wage and improved pensions more management 
accountability and protection of healthcare benefits 
the companies will be looking for more flexibility in work rules 
and scheduling and ways to hold down soaring health costs

soybean futures prices closed mostly higher 
thursday on the chicago board of trade while grain futures ended 
mostly lower reflecting nearperfect weather for crop development 
and wheat harvesting 
trading activity was slow 
support for soybeans stemmed from reports that the soviet union 
bought 330000 metric tons of soybean meal from argentina using 
west german marks said john frazier director of agricultural 
trading with gerald inc in chicago 
the reported purchase quieted speculation that the soviets would 
be unable to get financing for more grain purchases 
a weather pattern of mild temperatures and occasional showers is 
expected to continue through next week in the nations midsection 
those conditions could bring the winter wheat harvest to its 
abundant conclusion and help move the corn crop through its 
critical pollination phase without incident 
the weather is just about perfect and the market perceives 
that frazier said 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 4 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in july at 297 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to 4 cents lower with july at 267 a bushel oats were 
cent to 1 cents lower with july at 117 a bushel soybeans 
were 1 cent lower to 3 cents higher with july at 602 a bushel

a former citibank vice president whose job was 
to safeguard assets was sentenced thursday to eight years in prison 
for embezzling securities worth 25 million from the banks vault 
of the five 5 million certificates stolen four were recovered 
when the defendant mario rios pinochet tried to negotiate them 
three days after the jan 25 theft prosecutors said 
the fifth certificate which matured in february was never 
recovered 
pinochet 48 of weston conn claims to be a distant relative 
of former chilean dictator augusto pinochet 
he was convicted in may by a manhattan federal court jury of 
four felony counts stemming from the embezzlement 
pinochet was fired by citibank after his feb 1 arrest he 
maintains his innocence and plans an appeal 
even if it takes me 50 years i am going to prove i am 
innocent he told us district judge robert ward 
wards sentence of eight years fell in the middle range of the 
punishment allowed by federal sentencing guidelines the judge said 
he considered the seriousness of the charges and pinochets lack of 
remorse 
there is no question that his position allowed him to commit 
the crime ward said 
pinochet was a vice president in charge of a risk management 
team that investigated discrepancies in the handling of 
multimilliondollar securities held by citibank 
bank employees testified at trial that the bearer securities 
disappeared while pinochet was conducting a count of commercial 
paper in the banks vault under the guise of trying to improve 
procedures to safeguard assets 
then in what ward described as a james bond scenario he 
arranged the delivery of four of the certificates to the stamford 
conn office of paine webber inc in an envelope taped to the 
inside of a chilean newspaper 
according to trial evidence pinochet said he received the 
certificates from a courier in chile on behalf of three principals 
who turned out to be fictitious 
he instructed a broker at paine webber to wire the proceeds to 
an account in bermuda but the transaction was never completed 
because the broker discovered that the securities had been reported 
missing by citibank 
ward also imposed three years probation but ordered no fine 
because pinochet who is married with three children has no money 
the judge said pinochet would have to pay restitution if 
citibank is held responsible for the missing 5 million certificate 
during the years of his imprisonment and probation 
pinochet who has been in jail since his arrest was denied a 
request to be freed pending his appeal

declining equipment sales and unexpectedly high startup costs for 
the companys new credit card 
american telephone amp telegraph co warned of an expected drop in 
earnings in an unusual announcement three weeks ago but it did not 
say how steep it would be 
that announcement sent atampts stock price tumbling atampt is the 
nations most widely held stock 
but the market had little reaction to the actual profit decline 
which was within the expectations of industry analysts atampt shares 
rose 37 cents to close at 3750 on the new york stock exchange 
atampt said it earned 657 million or 60 cents a share in the 
quarter ended june 30 down from 699 million or 65 cents a share 
in the same quarter of 1989 
revenue fell to 903 billion from 926 billion a year earlier 
it was the phone companys first quarterly earnings drop since 
december 1988 when atampt lost 334 billion that loss the 
companys first ever resulted from a 672 billion charge it took 
against earnings to pay for a modernization program 
for the first six months of the year atampt earned 133 billion 
or 122 per share up from 129 billion or 120 a share 
revenue totaled 179 billion virtually unchanged from the same 
period of 1989 
atampt said the disappointing results last quarter were due mostly 
to slower sales of corporate telephone systems data communications 
gear and equipment sold to the federal government the company also 
blamed unexpectedly high costs for processing applications for its 
universal card which combines a mastercard or visa with telephone 
charge privileges 
the new yorkbased company blamed the 2 percent drop in 
equipment sales on a sluggish economy it said the introduction of 
the universal card in march produced twice the expected number of 
applications 
atampt also said its longdistance revenue was down 18 percent in 
the quarter due to less favorable access charge settlements with 
local phone companies and customer shifts to lowercost atampt 
services however the volume of longdistance calls rose 7 percent 
industry analysts said the fact longdistance volume rose while 
revenue declined pointed to the increasingly competitive nature of 
the long distance phone business 
atampt has been shifting its business customers to contracts that 
save them money to keep them from fleeing to competitors but it 
has come at a price in terms of what has happened to revenue 
growth said charles nichols who follows atampt for 
prudentialbache securities inc 
nichols said the secondquarter results also demonstrate how 
closely atampts fortunes are tied to the economy as economic growth 
slumps businesses spend less on phone systems and computers such 
as those sold by atampt 
in addition he said the pace of growth in longdistance volume 
has been slowing as the economy weakens 
despite the secondquarter problems atampt said it stood by its 
forecast that earnings for all of 1990 would exceed its record 1989 
earnings of 27 billion 
these results do not alter our confidence in our direction or 
our future prospects chairman robert e allen said in a news 
release 
gregory sawers an analyst at the investment firm sanford c 
bernstein amp co said it is difficult to predict earnings for atampt 
and other phone companies 
this is really virgin territory for investors in the sense 
theres never been a truly competitive long distance industry in 
this country he said 
that uncertainty was demonstrated earlier this week when united 
telecommunications inc parent of no 3 long distance company us 
sprint reported a 55 percent drop in its secondquarter earnings 
the news took industry analysts by surprise and sent the companys 
stock price sliding 
also this week no 2 mci communications corp said its 
secondquarter earnings rose 20 percent from a year earlier

a major waste disposal company thursday 
unveiled a program to allow new york communities to choose whether 
they want landfills or recycling centers rather than letting the 
state decide for them 
were asking that communities become our partners not just in 
developing a site but in locating a site browningferris 
industries inc chairman william ruckelshaus said 
bfi based in houston said its community partnership plan was 
limited for now to new york state the company said new york was 
selected because it needs landfills and because the process of 
opening new landfills has stopped 
only three new landfills have opened in new york since 1986 
while hundreds have closed and hundreds more are under order to 
close bfi spokesman gary brotherton said no landfill sites are 
selected in advance under bfis plan 
we believe it is up to the community to decide whether or not 
they want such a facility ruckelshaus said if they decide 
theyd like to go forward with a site wed like to participate 
ruckelshaus who twice headed the federal environmental 
protection agency and was an acting director of the fbi said if 
communities decide they dont want a landfill in their area bfi 
wont request permission from the statees solid waste management plan 
to expand 
landfill capacity to complement recycling and incineration

a double hull creates a ship within a ship it 
is two layers of steel separated by a gap of air around the sides 
and bottom of an oil tanker as an extra layer of protection 
environmental groups in a letter to a congressional committee 
this month said requiring doublehull tankers was the single 
most important step congress can take to prevent oil spills 
a compromise is pending in congress to have two hulls on new 
tankers and to retrofit or phase out singlehulled tankers within 
20 years the house originally wanted a 15year timetable while the 
senate asked for more study 
a double hull is not a beall or endall but weve got to 
build redundancy into the system said clifton curtis president 
of the oceanic society 
curtis called the compromise a signficant victory but he 
added we are sorely displeased with the fact that the retrofit 
schedule is not more rapid 
advocates of double hulls say they would limit the impact of oil 
spills if a tanker runs aground because a reef or manmade object 
would have to gash both layers to spill oil 
a coast guard study of 30 tanker groundings between 1969 and 
1973 said 96 percent of the spills would have been averted if the 
vessels had double hulls 
a double hull would not have prevented the exxon valdez spill 
but some studies say less crude oil would have fouled prince 
william sound in the nations worst oil spill 
double hulls are an extra margin of safety to prevent or 
minimize marine accidents said us coast guard commandant j 
william kime 
but critics say double hulls also may have drawbacks water can 
rush in between layers of the steel and make a ship settle lower 
thereby leaking more oil there are also fears explosive vapors 
could gather between the gaps 
double hulls are also more expensive it would have cost 10 
percent to 15 percent more to build a double hull on the 125 
million exxon valdez its damaged hull was repaired with 3000 tons 
of new steel but it still doesnt have a double hull 
retrofitting the 153 us tankers at 30 million each would cost 
46 billion the same work on 900 foreignflagged tankers could be 
as high as 10 billion industry officials said 
but the oil industry believes the debate is misdirected 
if an airplane crashes into a mountain we dont build planes 
that can withstand the impact we try to find out why and prevent 
it from happening again said sean connaughton of the american 
petroleum institute 
if we have ships running into underwater mountains we end up 
with people calling for ships that can withstand that type of 
collision connaughton said 
meanwhile some companies arent waiting for congress 
houstonbased conoco inc ordered two doublehull tankers in 
april and said it would order doublehull ships in the future 
norways statoil the largest producer of north sea crude oil 
said in june that it was ordering five new tankers two with double 
hulls and three with double or partial double bottoms

a small local energy company plans to introduce 
horizontal oil drilling to the soviet union when it begins 
developing two oil fields in western sibera 
anglosuisse whose 10 employees specialize in international oil 
exploration projects will use horizontal drilling both on existing 
wells and on the 400 additional wells the company plans to drill 
throughout the 250000 acres that compose the tagrinskoye and west 
varyeganskoye fields the company recently reached a development 
agreement with a soviet cooperative 
gilles labbe company president said the 5050 joint venture 
will mark the first known soviet foray into the popular drilling 
technology already credited with reviving previously dead oil 
fields in texas oklahoma and wyoming the houston chronicle 
reported thursday 
horizontally drilled wells begin as conventional vertical 
wells once deep underground they are gradually turned at a 
90degree angle enabling the drill bit to travel horizontally 
across hydrocarbon reserves rather than simply piercing them from 
above 
the development project is expected to produce as much as 800 
million barrels of oil over its 25year life officials said 
there are a tremendous number of prospects here said bob 
bryngelson president of mer engineering a houston firm working as 
a subcontractor on the anglosuisse venture its just like the 
middle east but its cold 
anglosuisse will split the cost of the 100 million project 
with the varyegan oil and gas association a soviet state oil 
company 
varyegan is providing the energy infrastructure for the project 
including electricity pipelines and roadway systems anglosuisse 
will contribute the engineering work and the drilling technology 
labbe said the company will begin soliciting investors for the 
venture later this year 
the costs and the profits will be split by the two partners 
anglosuisse began negotiating terms of the venture in march 
after being introduced to the soviet association through contacts 
in burma a contract was signed last month and work is scheduled to 
begin next january 
the anglosuisse venture is similar to dozens of other 
cooperative arrangements under negotiation between the soviet 
government and us energy companies 
many of those projects have been slow to materialize bogged 
down by overburdened bureaucracies in both the united states and 
the soviet union

frozen pork belly futures prices plummeted the 2centsapound 
permitted daily limit for the second straight day thursday on the 
chicago mercantile exchange reflecting burdensome supplies and 
slack demand for bacon 
on other commodity markets livestock futures ended mostly 
lower energy futures were mixed grains and soybeans were mixed 
and precious metals retreated 
frozen pork bellies settled 2 cents lower across the board with 
the contract for delivery in july at 4650 cents a pound and the 
more heavily traded august contract at 4442 cents a pound 
weak consumer demand for bacon which is made from pork bellies 
has weighed on the market for several weeks the situation has been 
reflected in the narrowing gap between prices of fresh bellies on 
the cash market and frozen bellies on the futures market 
belly futures normally are priced about 5 cents below cash 
bellies in midsummer creating an incentive for belly slicers to 
take bellies out of cold storage to meet the traditional summer 
surge in bacon demand said thomas morgan president of sterling 
research corp in arlington heights ill 
but so far this month bacon demand has been so weak and 
supplies of fresh bellies so ample that cash prices have dropped 
below futures on thursday fresh bellies sold for as low as 43 
cents a pound compared with the low of 4442 cents for the august 
futures contract 
the demand is slow enough that theyre barely using the fresh 
bellies so theres no incentive for them to pull the bellies out 
of the freezer said paul georgy president of the futures 
brokerage allendale inc in crystal lake ill 
georgy said the market may get some direction from the monthly 
agriculture department cold storage report which will be released 
after fridays close 
in livestock trading in chicago live cattle futures settled 13 
cent lower to 05 cent higher with august at 7615 cents a pound 
feeder cattle were unchanged to 35 cent lower with august at 8732 
cents a pound live hogs were 38 cent to 92 cent lower with july 
at 6357 cents a pound 
nearterm energy futures rose on the new york mercantile 
exchange in reaction to plans by operators of the alaska pipeline 
to reduce its output of crude oil by about 600000 barrels per day 
a 30 percent cut unless the company negotiates some other 
agreement to address pollution concerns 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents lower to 44 
cents higher with august at 1899 a barrel heating oil was 15 
cent lower to 27 cent higher with august at 5638 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 05 cent lower to 49 cent higher with august 
at 6307 cents a gallon 
soybean futures ended mostly higher in slow trading on the 
chicago board of trade while grain futures ended mostly lower 
reflecting nearperfect weather for crop development and wheat 
harvesting 
support for soybeans stemmed from reports that the soviet union 
bought 330000 metric tons of soybean meal from argentina using 
west german marks said john frazier director of agricultural 
trading with gerald inc in chicago 
the reported purchase quieted speculation that the soviets would 
be unable to get financing for more grain purchases 
wheat futures settled cent to 3 cents lower with july at 
297 a bushel corn was unchanged to 3 cents lower with july at 
268 a bushel oats were cent to 1 cents lower with july at 
117 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent lower to 3 cents higher with 
july at 602 a bushel 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold futures finished 20 cents 
to 60 cents lower with august at 36210 a troy ounce silver was 
33 cents to 5 cents lower with july at 4851 a troy ounce

percent drop in secondquarter earnings thursday saying high 
interest rates have hurt its major markets 
the supplier of construction and industrial materials said 
earnings for the quarter ended june 30 totaled 39 million or 92 
cents per share vs 54 million or 128 per share during the 
yearearlier period 
secondquarter sales totaled 771 million vs 721 million the 
1990 figures unlike those of 1989 include results from fiberglas 
canada 
these results reflect weakness in our major markets including 
new housing construction pleasure boats and automobiles said 
william w boeschenstein chairman and chief executive officer 
they are all being hurt by continued high interest rates and 
cautious consumer buying 
owenscorning said most areas of its construction products 
business were down during the quarter thanks to declining new 
housing and commercial construction but sales of insulation and 
roofing products for home improvements and remodeling held steady 
sales for the companys industrial materials group were up 
slightly during the quarter because of the addition of the results 
from fiberglas canada however owenscorning said demand for 
industrial materials appeared to be weakening in north america and 
in europe 
for the first six months owenscorning said earnings totaled 
71 million or 168 per share compared with 89 million or 
210 per share during the first six months of 1989 sales totaled

houghton mifflin co posted a 95 percent rise in 
second quarter earnings but the publisher said thursday its third 
quarter performance will be crucial to making the year a success 
earnings for the quarter that ended june 30 were 115 million 
or 81 cents a share compared with 105 million or 74 cents a 
share a year earlier 
net sales of 1225 million were recorded for the second 
quarter a rise of 11 percent over last years 1104 million 
houghton mifflin best known as a publisher of textbooks 
reported a loss for the first half of the year of 554000 or 4 
cents a share that compared with a loss of 749000 or 5 cents a 
share for the same period in 1989 
the results for the first six months of 1990 included a 
nonrecurring net gain of 4 million or 17 cents a share after 
taxes the company said 
firsthalf sales rose 8 percent to 1663 million from 1540 
million a year earlier 
the firsthalf results were in line with our 1990 business 
plans which call for increased revenues and income for the full 
year nader darehshori chairman and chief executive officer 
said in a prepared statement 
however school and college textbook sales in the third 
quarter will be key to fullyear results because a large proportion 
of those materials are ordered for the beginning of the new school 
year darehshori said 
stephen jaeger senior vice president and chief financial 
officer of the firm said a first quarter loss was to blame for the 
halfyear loss 
in the first quarter of the year our seasonal loss was larger 
than it had been historically jaeger said in an interview the 
first quarter in the publishing business is always one of little 
gain while fixed costs must still be paid he said 
that loss was right in line with our expectations for the 
period he said 
houghton mifflin gets about 80 percent of its income from 
textbooks the rest comes from general interest books 
sales in the companys general publishing section rose 33 
percent in the second quarter educational publishing sales rose 8 
percent and sales of elementary and secondary school texts made a 
strong showing as well due in large part because some states 
placed orders earlier than expected 
secondquarter expenses included an increase in the costs of 
developing new textbooks

securities and exchange commission chairman 
richard c breeden wound up defending rival regulator wendy gramm 
thursday to a senate panel questioning white house commitment to 
legislation that would shift regulatory control of stock index 
futures 
breeden also suggested a cap on the deposit insurance system and 
said a tax on stock transactions could hurt the markets 
but the senate banking committee hearing on modernizing 
financial institutions shifted to pending legislation on stock 
index futures as several panel members expressed doubts that the 
administration was really behind the bill 
sen timothy wirth dcolo said it looked like a cynical 
political exercise by the administration to support the bill 
and then when it doesnt pass and i think right now its 
looking very shaky up here they can say we told you so its 
just like the sampl scandal now its the congress fault 
despite officials claims that the bill must pass there hasnt 
been much lobbying by top administration officials noted sen 
donald w riegle dmich 
there is not a fullcourt press going on said riegle 
chairman of the committee in terms of an allout effort to get 
this accomplished im not seeing that 
the legislation would strip the commodity futures trading 
commission of authority over stock index futures and transfer it to 
the sec 
stock index futures often used in program trading strategies by 
large institutional investors such as pension funds allow 
investors to trade on the movement of a basket of stocks without 
having to buy the underlying stocks 
breeden and treasury secretary nicholas brady say the sec should 
have control over stock index futures to curb extreme volatility 
but wendy gramm the cftc chairman as well as futures exchanges 
and cftc supporters on congressional agriculture committees claim 
the jurisdiction switch isnt necessary and in fact would hurt the 
futures markets 
when wirth questioned how gramm a presidential appointee 
could be at odds with administration policy breeden found himself 
in the unusual position of defending his sometimeadversary 
one should not undercut the ability of the head of an 
independent agency to express disagreement breeden said 
asked about a possible tax on securities transactions that white 
house budget experts have reportedly been kicking around breeden 
said i think we have to be extraordinarily careful in creating 
taxes on capital formation 
we have to be very careful that we do not take steps which 
drive trade from our shores he said 
outside the hearing room breeden said he has not been privy to 
white house budget talks and does not know if a transaction tax is 
still on the table 
he also declined to speculate on the fate of the stock index 
futures bill although he said he was encouraged by the number of 
senators at the hearing who expressed a need for reform 
in his testimony breeden outlined possible reforms of deposit 
insurance which many fear could be subject to losses similar to 
those incurred in the multibillion dollar savings and loan bailout 
he suggested a possible cap on deposit insurance which now 
guarantees deposits of up to 100000 in every account 
breeden said the cap could limit the amount of deposits insured 
in each account or limit the number of accounts an individual can 
have insured 
he also suggested a system in which consumers would determine 
how much deposit insurance they want and pay accordingly much like 
life insurance 
i think most taxpayers are showing signs of being irate at 
having to pay for the losses the savings and loans incurred i 
think there will be very strong public support for trimming deposit 
insurance so that the thrift nightmare cannot be repeated 
breeden told reporters

unisys corp reported thursday a 78 
percent drop in second quarter profit while revenues dipped 4 
percent 
the nations thirdlargest computer company said it earned 118 
million in the quarter down from 536 million in the second 
quarter of 1989 unisys officials blamed the results partly on weak 
domestic sales 
revenue for the quarter totaled 247 billion down from 257 
billion for the same period last year 
after paying 269 million in preferred stock dividends the 
company lost 151 million in the quarter or 9 cents per share 
analysts said unisys officials are making slow but steady 
progress in turning around the company and predicted improvement 
it was obviously a disappointment but i think think theyll 
show results a dollar or so by the end of the year said 
william h gorman an analyst for provident national bank in 
philadelphia he said benefits from last years reorganization and 
work force cuts wouldnt start to show up until the last half of 
the year 
standard amp poors corp said thursday it had put unisys senior 
and subordinated debt and preferred stock on its creditwatch list 
with negative implications the ratings agency said it is concerned 
about unisyss ability to improve profitability and revenues over 
the long term 
unisys said its worldwide orders posted a slight gain in the 
quarter as defense orders rebounded from depressed levels a year 
earlier gains in international commercial orders were offset by 
continued weakness in us orders 
our us business remains weak and our international business 
while still growing is not as robust as a year ago said james 
a unruh president and chief executive officer 
unisys also reduced its debt by 265 million in the quarter and 
unruh said the company made significant progress toward a goal of 
reducing debt by 600 million to 800 million this year

housing construction fell for a fifth straight 
month in june hitting its lowest level since the last recession 
the commerce department said wednesday 
analysts said the 23 percent decrease in housing starts last 
month offered disturbing evidence of continued weakness in the 
overall economy especially in the housing industry 
theres still a stranglehold of weak growth as demonstrated 
by the housing report said allen sinai chief economist at the 
boston co 
analysts said the housing industry had been battered by high 
interest rates lower income growth and a deterioration in consumer 
confidence 
however they said the slump may be showing signs of bottoming 
out they noted that mortgage rates which shot up from 
middecember to early may have been falling since that time 
giving hope that potential buyers will be attracted back to the 
market 
also in one bit of good news in the new report the government 
said applications for building permits rose in june for the first 
time since january the 39 percent increase pushed permit 
applications to an annual rate of 111 million units 
what has happened here is weve hit a plateau weve been 
able to hang on to a little bit of a ridge on the cliff where we 
were falling down said martin regalia chief economist for the 
national council of savings institutions 
in june new homes and apartments were built at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 118 million units the government said 
last months decline followed decreases of 09 percent in may 
69 percent in april 122 percent in march and 51 percent in 
february 
it marked the first time housing construction has fallen for 
five months in a row since a string of declines from july through 
november in 1981 it pushed the level of building activity to its 
lowest point since october 1982 
analysts said they do not expect building activity to rebound 
significantly until a large backlog of unsold homes is worked down 
the bush administration fearful of the adverse impact that high 
interest rates were having on the economy has been pushing the 
federal reserve to loosen its grip on credit the fed made a small 
move in that direction last week 
for june construction of singlefamily homes edged down a 
slight 01 percent to an annual rate of 892000 units construction 
of multifamily units fell 87 percent to an annual rate of 285000 
units 
all geographic areas of the country except the south suffered 
declines 
the weakness was led by a big 109 percent drop in the 
northeast while housing starts fell 101 percent in the west and 
92 percent in the midwest the south had an 87 percent jump to an 
annual rate of 532000 units

mack trucks inc reported a 63 million 
loss in the second quarter thursday and gained a second suitor 
navistar international corp 
the interest from navistar came two weeks after renault 
vehicules industriels which owns 446 percent of mack stock 
announced it wanted to acquire the allentownbased truck maker in a 
buyout of 6 a share the french automaker said it would spend 98 
million for the mack stock 
navistar spokesman bill greenhill said the chicagobased truck 
maker has requested additional information from mack to determine 
whether to make an offer and at what price 
navistar told renault it would probably take about 10 days to 
complete its review and make a decision 
in a letter to mack navistar said it would not proceed with the 
offer without macks approval and a decision by the renault group 
to sell greenhill said 
in a statement issued by renault the company said it has told 
macks board it has no interest in selling its stake in the truck 
maker renaults offer is due to expire at midnight aug 8 
macks net loss of 633 million for the second quarter or 
213 per common share compared to a net loss of 196 million or 
66 cents per common share for the same period last year 
the company reported net sales of 4009 million in the second 
quarter down 23 percent from the same period in 1989 when net 
sales were 51885 million 
in a further complication of macks financial situation mack 
financial corp has been trying to extend a 350 million revolving 
credit agreement with chemical bank that matures friday 
company spokesman james santanasto said thursday no extension 
had been granted but negotiations were continuing 
the secondquarter losses were due largely to significant drops 
in sales and gross margin levels the company said 
also affecting the results was 217 million added to the 
warranty program which the company said needed a boost in its 
reserves because of continued unfavorable experience 
the second quarter results have caused mack to violate the terms 
of a 148 million credit agreement with citibank na and the new 
york branch of credit lyonnais 
the violation if not waived would permit the banks to 
accelerate payment on the outstanding principal 
mack pointing to renaults offer has requested a waiver until 
dec 31 santanasto said thursday the discussions were continuing

iraqs parliament has proposed that 
president saddam hussein be president for life the official iraqi 
news agency said thursday 
the 250member assembly which has been dominated by the 
governing baath party for the last two decades on wednesday ended 
a special threeday session to debate the new constitution 
ina said the assembly proposed changing a new draft constitution 
that said presidential elections should be held for the first time 
since iraq became a republic in 1958 with the head of state 
serving an eightyear term 
saddam 54 has said he will run in the election but so far 
there has been no mention of any challengers 
that was part of a package of political reforms including a 
multiparty system and a free press saddam promised following the 
august 1988 ceasefire in iraqs eightyear war with iran 
these were widely seen as being little more than a nod toward 
democracy with saddam staying firmly entrenched in power in this 
middle east nation of 17 million people 
saddam has been in absolute control since july 1979 when he 
took over as president from gen ahmed al bakr he served as vice 
president under bakr for 10 years and in effect became the 
strongman of the baathist regime 
ina said the assembly proposed other changes in the draft 
constitution but only mentioned the proposal to make saddam 
president for life 
under the present constitution the president is elected by the 
revolutionary command council composed of senior baath figures 
it will replace the current constitution drawn up in 1968 when 
the baath party seized power in a coup iraqs estimated 8 million 
eligible voters will decide on the new constitution in a nationwide 
referendum later this year 
if saddam is elected president for life presumably by the 
revolutionary command council it will consolidate his rule over 
iraq through his vast security apparatus 
the inner circle of the leadership is packed with saddams 
relatives by blood or marriage from his extended clan from takrit 
in northern iraq 
during the persian gulf war saddam made his power absolute by 
imposing tight personal control of the 1 millionstrong military 
and the baath party ostensibly socialist and panarab but now 
almost devoid of ideology beyond saddams policies 
he has turned his hold on power into a personality cult photos 
and posters of saddam are everywhere it is a capital offense to 
insult him publicly 
iraqi dissident sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
have claimed in recent weeks that up to 40 senior military figures 
including a cousin of saddam were arrested and probably executed 
in saddams latest purge 
there has been no independent confirmation of the reports 
since the ceasefire saddam has revived his ambitions to become 
the paramount leader of the arab world and has built up an arsenal 
of longrange missiles and chemical weapons that has drawn 
denunciations from the west and israel 
the presidentforlife move was reported after saddam earlier 
this week accused kuwait and the united arab emirates of violating 
their opec oil production quotas and threatened to retaliate with 
force if necessary 
he blamed them for an oil glut that drove down prices that he 
claimed has cost iraq 14 billion in lost revenue in the last year

documents released last week by federal regulators indicate bush 
voted to approve the in loans to walters 
walters one of silverados preferred shareholders and one of 
its biggest borrowers said he would try to pay back the money

diligently with my lenders restructuring staying alive for 
another day so that i can pay every dime back if i can he said
