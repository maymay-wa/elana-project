crack troops staged mock assaults at 
the presidential palace to simulate a rescue of president corazon 
aquino from an ambush wednesday while mrs aquino warned extremists 
against trying to topple her government 
mrs aquino gave her warning during the third anniversary 
celebration of her elite presidential security group at the 
presidential grounds 
in her speech mrs aquino cited the role of her security unit in 
thwarting the aug 28 1987 coup attempt the most serious of at 
least six attempts against her government 
the failed coup led by renegade lt col gregorio honasan left 
about 53 people dead and over 300 others seriously wounded mrs 
aquinos son benigno iii was injured and three of his security 
guards were killed 
the august 28 coup failed because the presidential security 
group increased to an intolerable level the price the enemies of 
freedom would have to pay to take power in this country mrs 
aquino said there would be no casual walk into the seat of power 
for them the way would be littered with their shattered ambitions 
their dead and our heroes 
honasan was captured in december 1987 but escaped the following 
april and has been in hiding since rumors swept the capital last 
week that he was recruiting followers for a new attempt 
mrs aquino said the ability of her security men to withstand 
attacks had stalled several other attempts against her 
during one exercise an eightman security team staged a mock 
assault on a building they charged from an armored personnel 
carrier and entered the ground floor of a building supposedly seized 
by renegade soldiers 
in another hooded members of an assault team stormed a bus which 
the scenario said had been taken over by terrorists team members 
used wooden ladders to scale the side of the bus smashed the 
windows with axes and pointed weapons inside 
a third exercise simulated an ambush on mrs aquinos limousine 
troops simulated firing at the terrorists while loyal troops sped 
the car to a helipad where a woman pretending to be the president 
was helicoptered to safety

about 35 people marched monday in support 
of the three animal rights activists who have spent the past week 
atop a 160foot crane to protest construction of a new university 
animal research facility 
university of california officials said they planned to seek jail 
terms and fines for the crane sitters if they continue to defy 
orders to come down and estimated the protest was costing the 
school 30000 a day 
the three protesters offered sunday to come down if the 
university dropped all charges against them but school officials 
refused 
if we cave in to this kind of behavior to people who behave 
like terrorists then were subject to this kind of behavior at 
every turn said assistant chancellor john cummins were going 
to wait them out theyll get tired and theyll come down 
jonnie vermont who climbed down from the crane friday told 
supporters if theyre the university going to pay hardball 
were going to play hardball 
a protester identified only as lee climbed the crane sunday with 
the use of a mountainclimbing harness blowing kisses and eating an 
orange while dangling from a 20foot rope 
the protesters originally numbered six when they climbed the 
crane last tuesday four climbed down but one went back with a 
backpack of food and water saturday since saturday campus police 
have occupied the cab of the crane 
we have no illusions that we are going to halt construction of 
the facility for good said todd paterson who came down from the 
crane after more than 84 hours but we have been able to draw 
attention to the issue and to let people know how dangerous this 
would be 
animal rights activists contend the lab will be used to conduct 
cruel and unnecessary experiments on animals is located dangerously 
close to an earthquake fault and could release toxic material into 
the environment 
a counterprotest was held across the street from mondays 
demonstration 
animal researchers are as humane as anyone and we make sure 
the animals are not mistreated and abused thats all their own 
fantasies university physiology professor charles nicoll of the 
coalition for animals and animal research said at the 
counterdemonstration 
the university won a court ruling friday that ordered a halt to 
the protest attorneys plan to return to court tuesday to seek 
30day jail terms or 500 fines for protesters who resist 
university spokesman ray colvig said there were no plans to try 
to storm the crane and forcibly remove demonstrators because of the 
potential danger 
howard lichtig a castro valley attorney representing the 
demonstrators said the university was being unreasonable 
the university has foreclosed negotiations he said

rescinded an order banning five conservative clubs at the school 
from renting meeting rooms and vending tables at the campus center 
a spokeswoman said monday 
however the campus republican club and an affiliate of a 
cambridgebased marxist group the spartacist league remain under 
the ban because of a brawl between members of those groups at the

a student was injured in the fight which was the second 
confrontation between the groups in a month the head of the school 
buildings departemnt is investigating the incident

student groups because they were suspected of renting rooms for the 
republican club in defiance of the ban 
the school lifted the ban against the other groups on friday 
hopkins said the office of student affairs felt the ban wasnt the 
most appropriate way to handle the situation 
an attorney for the republican club said he believed the ban was 
a violation of the clubs right of free speech and assembly and that 
he was speaking with university attorneys about lifting it

chinas barring of its bestknown dissident from a 
banquet given by president bush dramatizes the growing tension 
between authorities and intellectuals clamoring for a voice in 
modernization 
it also illustrates how chinas desire to build bridges to the 
outside world clashes with its authoritarian tradition 
the deployment of an estimated 100 police to stop fang lizhi from 
making it to bushs banquet sunday could only have been ordered by 
the highest level of leadership the communist party central 
committee or even senior leader deng xiaoping 
deng has particular reason to dislike fang the 53yearold 
astrophysicist recently sent him a letter calling for the release of 
political prisoners especially wei jingsheng who has been jailed 
since 1979 for criticizing deng 
fang has beome a hero to many intellectuals especially students 
because he dares say that economic and scientific progress is 
impossible without freedom of expression 
despite chinas increased prosperity under deng intellectuals 
have become increasingly disaffected because they believe china 
cannot ever catch up to developed countries unless the government 
allows more open exchanges of ideas 
fangs harassment he had been invited by bush appears a 
signal that the leadership is fumbling for a policy toward the 
troublesome intellectuals it contradicts recent signs that a 
gradual liberalization might be permitted 
a twoyear freeze followed the last burst of dissident activity 
but a new ferment of intellectual debate emerged late last year in 
the arts and among social scientists 
growing numbers of informal discussion groups have popped up in 
the cities and artists have held daring new exhibits of nudes and 
avantgarde paintings 
scholarly journals have published searching essays on chinas 
national character its recent past and new interpretations of 
socialism 
no action has been taken against any of the government critics 
but top officials have expressed displeasure with the clamor 
they have stressed in recent speeches the need for social order 
a message they reiterated in strong language in meetings with bush 
fangs treatment supports the view that chinas conservatives 
have gained the upper hand over reformists led by party general 
secretary zhao ziyang 
most evidence for this comes in the economic field where since 
september the government has reimposed a wide range of controls over 
the economy that had been lifted during a decadelong effort to 
stimulate growth 
chinese leaders do not support fangs premise that free debate 
across all fields is necessary for economic modernization they have 
indicated support for some limited debate on the best solutions for 
chinas current economic woes doubtless in hopes that someone will 
come up with a good idea 
but generally they regard public debate as destabilizing and a 
possible threat to their hold on power 
few intellectuals believe that the police action against fang 
heralds the start of a fullblown campaign against liberalism such 
as has recurred regularly since the communists came to power in 1949 
but they say the move is troubling if only because of its 
apparent clumsiness coming during a us presidential visit that was 
supposed to celebrate the two countrys 10 years of friendly 
relations 
it was crazy stupid said fangs wife li shuxian 
fang said he would not be silenced and predicted more and more 
intellectuals will speak the truth 
the confrontation between the government and scholars may come to 
a head on may 4 the 70th anniversary of the start a major 
intellectual movement for democracy scientific thought and 
nationalism 
beijing university students already have begun a countdown

the opposition crumbled and the legislature 
declared the bizcochito the official cookie of new mexico 
the controversy wasnt over whether the light sugary confection 
should be the state cookie but how to spell it the tug of war 
continued until the final vote monday in the house of 
representatives as it concurred with the spelling preferred by the 
senate 
the bill now goes to gov garrey carruthers whose preference is 
unknown 
ever since the bill was introduced there was a disagreement over 
whether the cookie should be spelled bizcochito or 
biscochito 
legislation introduced several weeks ago by rep edward sandoval 
would have made the biscochito the official cookie 
but spanishlanguage purists insisted the proper spelling was 
with a z 
legislators seesawed on the spelling finally approving 
bizcochito 
sandoval was neutral he said he had reviewed several cookbooks 
and three had it one way and three had it the other 
added rep ramon huerta it matters not a bit how its spelled 
what matters is the pronunciation

a special task force of manufacturers airline 
operators and regulatory agencies is expected to recommend tuesday 
that mandatory modifications be made on aging boeing jetliners 
the group will make its findings public at a news conference 
after meeting to put the final touches on its recommendations 
the special committee known as the aging transport working 
group was created as part of a 150member group to study the 
fitness of older transport aircraft 
for the past nine months it has examined the maintenance and 
repair records of boeing 747s 737s and 727s and scores of 
manufacturers service orders and government directives affecting 
the planes 
the group has studied the various methods used for aircraft 
inspection as well as the possible need to intensify the inspection 
process or to make modifications to the aircraft themselves 
in some cases the group is expected to recommend that areas 
which previously were allowed to be inspected for possible problems 
should now be permanently modified to correct any defect 
the task forces recommendations if adopted by the federal 
aviation administration which has representatives on the panel 
would be a departure from a system that relied primarily on 
inspection orders and mandatory repairs when needed 
the average age of the worlds 8800 passenger airliners is about 
13 years with half the planes in many major us fleets well over 
15 years old according to avmark an appraisal and consulting firm 
the recommendations came four days after a hole ripped open in 
united air lines oldest 747 sending nine passengers hurling to 
their deaths 17 minutes after takeoff from honolulu but 
investigators in that incident said they found no signs of metal 
fatigue that is often a factor in damage to older airliners and were 
focusing on the possibility of a faulty cargo door

wanted new industry 5000 reward 
so say printed enticements distributed by leaders of this feisty 
little north texas town of 9000 near the sparkling waters of possum 
kingdom lake 
graham wants new business and industry and is willing to pay 
someone for finding it 
whos eligible for the bounty practically everyone bordello 
operators need not apply 
the graham industrial association and the graham chamber of 
commerce will confidentially and professionally follow up on your 
suggestion the wanted posters proclaim 
if your recommended company successfully locates in graham and 
provides at least 10 new jobs for a least six months you will 
receive a 5000 check for providing us with the contact person 
graham is neither the first nor the last city to woo new industry 
with incentives and innovative schemes but the reward program does 
have a fresh touch 
greeds the word that comes readily to mind but the graham 
covenant as author robert ludlum would call it really is just a 
cash inducement to help rescue a small texas town stricken by the 
oil slump 
we will give 5000 to anybody and everybody who can provide us 
with a lead that results in a new industry or business coming to 
graham mayor ed hinson tells anyone wholl listen 
we want to get the attention of all graham citizens clerks 
truck drivers gas station attendants and give them the chance to 
do something for graham and help themselves in the process 
but hinson and city manager larry fields who concocted the 
scheme at a board meeting of coffee drinkers stress that anyone 
can win the bounty 
the graham covenant maintains that the city can offer available 
manufacturing warehousing distribution office space acreage for 
new construction utilities a productive labor force and for new 
employees a quality of life that features abundant hunting and 
fishing opportunities 
deer turkey quail duck and dove lure hunters from the 
dallasfort worth area 100 miles to the east and the bass fishing 
at possum kingdom while spotty is among the best in texas 
thats what drew me to this part of the country said fields 
theyre catching some big bass down there now including a couple 
of 13 pounders 
but bass and birds aside these folks are deadly serious which 
they demonstrated by hiring an executive director in february to 
orchestrate the joint chamberindustrial association program 
their choice was eh sheffield an east texas native with an 
impressive record of attracting industry in dallas suburbs 
in both lancaster and lewisville he was involved extensively 
in expanding and locating new industry for those communities said 
glyn gilliam president of the industrial association 
he brings a wealth of experience to the newly created position 
having served for more than 30 years in chamber management and 
economic and tourist development 
sheffield said he welcomes the opportunity and is up to the 
challenge which may be formidable 
were going to put him to the test out here said wayne 
pruett publisher of the graham leader the towns twiceweekly 
newspaper we didnt come up with this money for fun and games 
thats not to say the graham covenant escaped without a bit of 
frivolity since the most frequent recommendation concerns the 
oldest profession 
theres been a lot of inquiries about a cathouse for graham 
but that doesnt qualify fields said with a grin 
hinson said at least three legitimate proposals were being 
pursued but he could not discuss them out of fairness to the bounty 
hunters involved 
oil and gas is the no 1 industry in young county and carlisle 
memory products with 500 workers is the towns leading employer 
graham has several vacant buildings but actually has survived the 
economic downturn better than most similarsize texas cities 
in the champagne days of abundant highpriced oil graham was a 
model of country prosperity and to a certain extent it still is 
said the mayor 
grahams unique if somebody has a good idea he can raise a 
lot of money locally 
including 5000 up front

the us cotton stockpile is outgrowing demand 
from domestic textile mills as well as from overseas markets 
according to an agriculture department report 
cotton exports in 198889 are forecast at 69 million bales down 
from 762 million bales last year 
aggressive pricing by major foreign exporters and heavy 
movement of us cotton under government price support loan have 
been largely responsible for the decline the report said monday 
when a farmer obtains a price support loan for cotton or another 
commodity it cannot be sold until the loan is repaid often when 
market prices are low a farmer will not repay the loan and forfeit 
the commodity to the government 
despite a number of adjustments in the loan program to make us 
cotton more competitive in the world market prices still remain 
above those of foreign competitors the report said 
meanwhile cotton use by us textile mills reached 76 million 
bales in 198788 the most in 15 years but this seasons mill use 
is expected to drop to 69 million bales 
reduced denim demand and consumer preference for more 
finecount yarn products are lowering mill use the report said 
as a result us cotton stockpiles which were less than 58 
million bales last aug 1 are expected to climb to 92 million by 
this aug 1 the beginning of the 198990 cotton marketing year

president bushs choice to head the new 
veterans affairs department faces questioning about why he tipped 
off the south korean embassy 12 years ago that a korean agent was 
about to defect to the united states 
edward j derwinski initially denied that the tip had come from 
him only acknowledging it in 1983 in testimony before the senate 
foreign relations committee that testimony was unpublished but it 
was uncovered in the national archives last month by the los angeles 
times 
derwinski a former illinois congressman and recent state 
department official was due before the senate veterans affairs 
committee today for a closeddoor hearing the committee plans to 
continue considering his nomination in open session on wednesday 
during a 1978 investigation of the korean case derwinski denied 
that the tip came from him and declined to answer a grand jurys 
questions about the episode 
in 1977 the defector sohn ho young and his family were 
spirited away from his new jersey home by the fbi just a half hour 
before the arrival of agents of the korean central intelligence 
agency for whom he worked 
derwinski at the time was a member of a house committee 
investigating the koreagate affair involving bribes by south 
korea to members of congress 
in a recent interview derwinski talked about the koreagate 
episode it was dumb of me thats easy to say now its 
hindsight i didnt have hindsight then 
derwinski a vigorous defender of the korean government at the 
time said that when he learned the koreagate committee was planning 
to call sohn as a witness he told the embassy another pr blow is 
headed your way i didnt know his name rank or serial number 
i thought the committee spotlighting him was uncalled for i 
thought the committee by its grandstanding was damaging uskorean 
relations derwinski said 
derwinski said that in his recent courtesy calls on members of 
the senate veterans affairs committee he found that basically 
they understand if they put themselves in my shoes 
derwinski acknowledged tipping off the koreans in foreign 
relations committee testimony in 1983 when he was nominated to be 
counselor to the state department a job he won after the redrawing 
of his illinois congressional district caused him to lose the house 
seat he had held for 24 years 
he later became an undersecretary for security assistance the 
post he held when chosen by president bush to head the new cabinet 
department 
the department will be created on march 15 out of the veterans 
administration a change long sought by veterans groups 
in a speech monday to the largest such group the american 
legion derwinski warned against unrealistic expectations from the 
change in status we realize that with the budget problems facing 
this administration were not going to be the priority group he 
said 
though medical officers of the va have testified that their 108 
billion budget for this year is 600 million to 1 billion short of 
what is needed derwinski said after his speech that he did not 
think he could get additional money this year

the discovery could be ready for 
launch as early as next week but a highpriority military rocket 
liftoff could bump the shuttle flight at least two days officials 
said 
a decision on a shuttle launch date will be made friday at the 
conclusion of a flight readiness review 
on monday thomas utsman deputy director of the kennedy space 
center said the center was ready for the discovery flight but his 
statement did not give a launch date 
other officials said the launch target date of march 9 has not 
changed 
sources however said the air force has scheduled a military 
launch about that time and that it would have priority over a 
shuttle launch for national security reasons 
the national aeronautics and space administration relies heavily 
on air force tracking facilities for a shuttle flight air force 
officials reportedly told space agency officials monday they could 
not support a discovery launch before march 11 later if the 
military launch is delayed on a daybyday basis 
the nature of the military launch was not disclosed but there 
are two flights being readied the first submarine launch of the new 
trident 2 intercontinental range missile and a delta rocket carrying 
a payload for the strategic defense initiative or star wars 
missile defense system 
the conflict will have to be resolved at the thursdayfriday 
flight readiness review during which toplevel nasa managers will 
examine all aspects of the shuttle mission 
the discovery launch had been scheduled for feb 23 but was 
postponed after two tiny cracks were discovered in an oxygen 
turbopump in one of atlantis main engines following a flight by 
that shuttle in december 
because discoverys three turbopumps went through the same 
manufacturing process nasa decided to replace them delaying the 
mission 
five astronauts commanded by veteran shuttle flier mike coats 
are to deploy a large communications satellite and conduct medical 
and technological experiments during discoverys planned five days 
in orbit

president bushs fastpaced asian trip provided 
a daily dose of telegenic photo opportunities but few clues about 
his brand of foreign policy other than that it will tone down 
americas approach on human rights 
it seemed bushs purpose in more than 18000 miles of travel was 
simply to touch base with other leaders and reaffirm friendly 
relations 
there was no sign of any new initiatives 
over five days bush zipped through tokyo beijing and seoul 
pumping hands and posing for pictures with more than 20 foreign 
leaders in dramatic settings 
the only time bush stood still was during a threehour appearance 
at the funeral of emperor hirohito 
not everything came off quite as planned the white house script 
did not call for the trip to vie for attention with the drama at 
home over john towers troubled nomination as secretary of defense 
and there was a diplomatic slap in beijing where chinese 
authorities prevented the countrys top dissident from attending 
bushs banquet 
at the very moment that bush was declaring the chineseamerican 
relationship vital to the security interests of the united states 
and was toasting the future of uschina relations a future 
filled with achievement good fortune and peace the chinese were 
taking a step that they must have known would be seen as insulting 
but the next day bush restricted himself to a muted expression of 
regret regret not outrage over the chinese refusal to let 
fang lizhi meet with him 
to rub it in the chinese through their foreign ministry 
spokesman gave bush a public lecture on human rights telling him 
in effect not to raise the subject 
human rights was not discussed white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater reported later a day later fitzwater reversed 
himself and said human rights were discussed privately in china by 
bush but he couldnt say with whom 
fitzwater said bush believes that quiet diplomacy is the 
appropriate course for raising human rights in china 
that was a sharp contrast with former president ronald reagan 
who highlighted human rights problems in communist nations and 
always made the subject the very first topic of discussion in 
dealings with the soviet union 
right from the outset bush was thrown on the defensive in tokyo 
about tower 
world leaders who were ushered in for 20minute meetings with the 
new american president saw him peppered with embarrassing questions 
about the man he wants to run the pentagon 
the tower issue followed bush to beijing to seoul and back to 
washington where today the president was calling senators in 
onebyone to ask for their support 
for all of bushs activity in asia there was no sign of progress 
on nagging trade frictions particularly with japan and south korea 
members of south koreas national assembly applauded warmly when 
bush pledged not to remove the 42000 american troops in that 
country 
but those same legislators sat stonily silent when he repeated 
the us complaint that seoul needs to do more to reduce trade 
barriers 
in tokyo bush met with leaders of jordan egypt and israel in 
what the white house said was part of the search for peace in the 
region 
afterward bush said there were new opportunities in the 
middle east but there was no sign that the united states was ready 
to step in and try to capitalize on them 
the white house was sensitive about suggestions that it is going 
slowly and having trouble getting its act together 
the worst thing you could do the most foolish thing you could 
do is to try and enact foreign policy in a period of time measured 
in days or even a few weeks after having been inaugurated said 
white house chief of staff john sununu 
even if it were sound policy he said it probably would 
have been perceived as doing something rashly and quickly without 
consultation 
the other side of the coin is that bush risks losing the 
opportunity afforded a new administration for change and innovation 
in the first days of its life already it seems to be settling down 
to business as usual from the reagan administration and the 
honeymoon with congress seems to be evaporating

a 44yearold rightist was sentenced to 20 months in 
prison today for mailing a revolver and bullet to prime minister 
noboru takeshita to discourage him from running in party elections 
a court official said 
hideki kashima head of a rightist organization in takamatsu 
southwestern japan was guilty of trying to sway the democratic 
structure by forcing through his own political stance the tokyo 
district court said in handing down its verdict 
kashima was accused of mailing a parcel containing the firearms 
and a leaflet criticizing takeshita as a moneyoriented 
politician to his office in downtown tokyo in september 1987 
he was later arrested after investigators found his 
organizations address on a separate letter sent earlier to 
takeshitas office 
kashima demanded that takeshita then secretarygeneral of the 
governing liberal democratic party not run for party president in 
japan the winner of the governing partys presidency also becomes 
the prime minister 
takeshita who became prime minister in october 1987 has 
recently been plagued by a widening stockprofiteering scandal which 
has toppled several ranking members in his administration

the supreme court is using an illinois case to 
study an unusual criminal justice question whether a white 
defendant is ever treated unfairly when prosecutors exclude blacks 
from the jury 
the court said monday it will decide if a chicagoarea white man 
who was sentenced to 85 years in prison after his conviction by an 
allwhite jury for rape kidnapping and armed robbery should get a 
new trial 
the decision expected sometime next year might not affect a 
significant number of cases but it could limit further the 
traditionally broad power of prosecutors to eliminate prospective 
jurors from trials by using socalled peremptory challenges 
peremptory challenges allow disqualification of jurors without 
explanation 
the appeal contends the challenges violated a 1986 supreme court 
ruling forbidding the use of racial criteria and denied the 
defendant a jury representing a crosssection of the community 
in other matters monday the court 
agreed to take a new look at how far communities may go in 
regulating sexually oriented businesses by judging the validity of a 
dallas licensing ordinance 
the justices said they will decide whether the dallas ordinance 
which among other things bars anyone convicted of certain crimes 
from operating a sexually oriented business violates freespeech 
rights 
refused to revive an affirmative action program in south bend 
ind that called for hiring more blacks and hispanics as 
firefighters and police officers 
but in a related case from vallejo calif the justices rejected 
reverse discrimination arguments by a white firefighter denied a 
promotion that went to a black man with a slightly lower test score 
in the california case the court left intact a ruling that 
upheld the black mans promotion to help achieve better racial 
balance within the citys fire department 
turned down the appeal of bernhard goetz who in 1984 shot four 
young men he said were going to rob him on a new york city subway 
the justices let stand goetzs conviction for illegally possessing a 
gun and the oneyear prison sentence and 5000 fine it drew 
in the chicago case daniel holland is contesting his criminal 
conviction on grounds that prosecutors used two of their 12 
automatic challenges to exclude the only black potential jurors 
prosecutors denied that the two disqualifications were racially 
motivated 
the high court in 1986 barred prosecutors from ever disqualifying 
potential jurors based on their race but that equalprotection 
ruling involved a black defendant and jurors of his race 
the illinois supreme court ruled that a white man such as holland 
lacks the legal standing to challenge the exclusion of blacks from 
his jury 
in addition to raising the equalprotection argument handled in 
the 1986 supreme court decision hollands appeal says the exclusion 
of blacks violated his sixth amendment right to a jury representing 
a fair crosssection of the community 
the court in past rulings have applied that right in cases of 
racial bias in the selection of pools of potential jurors but has 
not yet applied it to particular juries picked 
holland was convicted in the may 4 1980 rape and kidnapping of 
a des plaines ill teenager

the earthquake that killed 25000 people in 
armenia pushed last years earthquakerelated death toll worldwide 
to the highest level since 1976 when a chinese earthquake killed at 
least 10 times as many the us geological survey reports 
the estimated earthquake death toll in 1988 includes an 
additional 2000 or more people who died in other earthquakes around 
the world the survey reported monday 
although the annual average death toll for earthquakes is about 
10000 in 1987 only 1100 lives were lost 
in addition to the deaths some 13000 people were injured and 
more than a halfmillion were left homeless in the armenian 
earthquake which had a magnitude of 68 on the richter scale the 
death toll of 25000 is the most recent reported by the soviets the 
exact toll in unknown 
the main shock was followed within minutes by a second measuring 
58 on the richter scale which estimates the energy released by an 
earthquake an earthquake of 50 can cause considerable damage and 
the strength rises by 10 times for each whole number on the scale 
many of the deaths in armenia were blamed on collapsing 
buildings as the earthquake rattled concrete structures until they 
fell to the ground according to subsequent analyses 
another recent earthquake in the soviet union claiming about 
1000 lives struck in soviet central asia that one occurred in 
january however and so does not count in the 1988 toll 
last years second most deadly earthquake occurred aug 20 on the 
nepalindia border killing 1000 that earthquake measuring 66 on 
the richter scale destroyed thousands of homes and injured many 
people 
on nov 6 an earthquake measuring 73 on the scale claimed 730 
lives and injured about 4000 people on the border between burma and 
china the geological survey reported 
and on the indiaburma border three deaths were reported in an 
aug 6 earthquake that caused landslides 
the survey said it recorded 61 significant earthquakes last year 
15 fewer than the year before an earthquake is considered 
significant if it has a magnitude of 65 on the richter scale 
earthquakes of lesser magnitude are included if they cause 
casualties or considerable damage 
three significant earthquakes were recorded in the united states 
last year including the strongest shock of the year that 
earthquake measured at 76 occurred march 6 in the gulf of alaska 
and resulted in only minor damage 
the only us earthquake death last year occured when someone 
suffered a heart attack after an earthquake measuring 48 in 
whittier calif in february the other significant us earthquake 
occurred dec 3 in pasadena calif it was measured at 46 on the 
scale and caused some injuries and property damage 
an earthquake centered in eastern canada on nov 25 was felt 
widely across that country and in the northeastern united states as 
far south as washington the survey reported it had a magnitude of 
57 earthquakes in the eastern part of north america tend to be 
felt over larger areas than earthquakes of similar strength in the 
west 
europe recorded three earthquake deaths last year when one rated 
at 30 killed a group of miners in czechoslovakia on sept 2 
in addition an earthquake rated at 58 caused several injuries in 
albania on jan 9 
injuries were also reported from two offshore earthquakes one in 
the ionian sea near greece oct 16 and another near the azores 
islands nov 21 
in africa eight people working in a gold mine in south africa 
died jan 5 in an earthquake rated at 52 
and japan usually very seismically active recorded only one 
significant earthquake last year the survey reported that 
earthquake measured 54 and resulted in 10 injuries and minor damage 
in the tokyo area

the wave of bankruptcies and foreclosures that 
engulfed thousands of financially troubled farmers during the 
mid1980s has left millions of acres in the hands of bankers 
insurance companies and other lenders says an agriculture 
department report 
but the situation is slowly improving according to the 
departments economic research service as of mid1988 about 793 
million acres of farm property valued at 329 billion were held by 
the primary lending groups down from a peak of 898 million acres 
and 359 billion on dec 30 1987 
the groups include the cooperative farm credit system commercial 
banks farmers home administration and life insurance companies 
lenders acquired much of the property through farm bankruptcies 
foreclosures or transfer of deed in lieu of foreclosure 
the drop in lenders property holdings reflects an improving 
farm economy and rising land values the report said earlier 
fears that lenders would dump acquired farmland on already weak land 
markets now appear unfounded the drought last year probably had 
little net effect on lenders holdings 
one of the reports authors economist jerome stam said monday 
that he believed the decline in property holdings has continued but 
that he had no idea what the figures might show by mid1989 
im not going out on a limb on that one he said but i 
would like to think it would keep on going down 
others who worked on the report include agency economists gregory 
gajewski and steven koenig 
life insurance companies hold the most farmland 4125000 acres 
as of june 30 1988 valued at more than 152 billion the 
companies surpassed the farm credit system or fcs in mid1987 as 
the largest holder of farm property 
the holdings of the other major groups as of june 30 1988 
included fcs 1438405 acres and a value of 7061 million 
commercial banks 882300 acres and 428 million fmha 1487845 
acres and 6286 million 
holdings by the fcs peaked at the end of 1986 at 27 million 
acres worth about 1 billion 
most fcs institutions which include federal land banks have 
been pursuing a more aggressive land sales strategy than the life 
insurance companies the report said 
the four groups of lenders accounted for about 78 percent of the 
767 billion in farm real estate debt excluding household debt as 
of dec 31 1988 the remaining 22 percent was held by individuals 
and others including many who sold farms on contract or took a 
mortgage as part of the sales agreement 
department economists said little is known about acquired or 
reverted property held by this group 
comparatively current farmland holdings are small compared with 
those during the great depression at the end of 1937 the top 
lenders held about 28 million acres compared with less than 9 
million acres on dec 31 1987 
however the runup in holdings during the 1980s took only a few 
years the report said the depression holdings grew throughout 
the 1920s and 1930s 
could sales of surplus farm property including land and 
buildings be large enough to depress farmland prices 
at the 1987 peak lender holdings were equal to only 07 percent 
of the total 550 billion value at that time and represented only 
09 percent of the roughly 1 billion acres in farms 
but looked at another way the lenderheld property is larger in 
terms of annual farmland sales in the first quarter of 1987 lender 
holdings were equivalent to about 24 percent of annual sales in 
terms of acreage and nearly 20 percent in terms of value 
lender holdings are large enough to overshadow other influences 
on land prices the report said but sales of holdings have not 
depressed prices because lenders do not sell all their holdings in 
one year 
the life insurance companies with their large holdings 
generally have been slow to sell and attempts by the fmha an 
agency of the agriculture department have been hampered by congress 
and the courts nevertheless the report added the potential impact 
of lender holdings is relatively greater in some regions

the agriculture department says china has been 
authorized to buy an additional 2 million metric tons of us wheat 
at subsidized prices 
acting undersecretary richard w goldberg said monday the wheat 
will be available to china under the departments export enhancement 
program or eep a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 
367 bushels of wheat 
under eep arrangement private exporters can sell us 
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition 
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
the subsidies have ranged from less than 20 to more than 40 per 
ton of wheat or in the range of 54 cents to 109 per bushel 
under previous eep authorizations china has bought more than 74 
million tons of wheat for delivery in 198889 only 10000 tons 
remained in the previous authorization issued on dec 30 
china is the biggest foreign customer of american wheat farmers 
this year and also expected to be the worlds largest single 
importer of wheat in 198889 
according to usda projections china may import about 15 million 
tons of wheat from all foreign sources while the soviet union is 
expected to import 13 million tons 
the soviets as of feb 23 had bought about 3 million tons of 
wheat from the united states compared with the 74 million tons by 
china all the 198889 us wheat sales to the soviet union and 
china have been subsidized

from school problems and sex education to the 
hot issue of choice school board presidents disagree frequently 
with the public that elected them according to a survey released 
today 
the attitude gaps were uncovered by the private national center 
for education information in a survey of school board presidents 
across the united states 
these people really do start out being representative of the 
public said center director emily feistritzer a veteran 
education analyst but the longer people have been on school 
boards the more coopted they are by the system and the more 
resistant to any changes in it 
the survey found that 97 percent of school board presidents are 
white 71 percent are male and 68 percent have never held any job 
in an education system nearly half are in their 40s 94 percent are 
married and almost twothirds have children still at home they are 
better educated make more money and are more conservative 
politically than the average american 
generally school board presidents who have been members of their 
boards for short times were found to want changes in numerous areas 
of education those who have been on their boards 10 years or more 
26 percent of the total are more resistant to changes the 
survey found 
among the surveys most unexpected discoveries was the gap 
between school board presidents and the public on public school 
choice the concept of letting parents select which local school 
their child attends 
a 1987 gallup poll found that 71 percent of the public believes 
parents should be able to send their children to the school of their 
choice only 36 percent of school board presidents said parents 
should be able to make that decision 51 percent said no and 13 
percent said they didnt know 
the majority feel such a system would create inequities and 
logistical nightmares according to feistritzer 
they are very informed about choice and they are diametrically 
opposed to it feistritzer said with this kind of opposition 
the likelihood that choice will be a fait accompli in the next few 
years is not very high 
another area in which school board presidents diverged from 
public opinion was in rating school problems in a 1988 gallup poll 
asked about the biggest problems faced by schools 32 percent of the 
general public cited drug use and 19 percent said lack of discipline 
by contrast only 10 percent of the board presidents picked drug 
use and 4 percent lack of discipline but 61 percent of them said 
lack of proper financial support for the school system was a major 
problem 
when asked to rate their own schools 79 percent of the school 
board presidents gave them an a or a b nearly twice as generous as 
the 40 percent of the public that gave their local schools an a or b 
in a gallup poll last spring 
but the board presidents agreed with the public that nationally 
us schools are not doing too well only 33 percent gave them an a 
or a b grade they also reflected prevailing public views in their 
strong support for paying teachers on the basis of performance and 
requiring them to pass competency tests before they can teach 
the school board presidents went afield again in the area of sex 
education with 80 percent favoring elementary school instruction in 
grades 48 compared to only 55 percent of the general public in a 
spring 1987 gallup poll 
there are 40 million students enrolled in public schools in more 
than 15000 school districts across the country 
the feistritzer survey was based on questionnaires completed by 
1217 school board presidents or chairmen responses were weighted 
to reflect all districts and the results had a margin of error of 3 
percentage points

a private group says it will sue the 
environmental protection agency to make it tighten its pesticide 
standards because current allowable levels in fruits and vegetables 
pose a risk to preschool children 
the group the natural resources defense council said in a 
report released monday that current standards fail to account for 
the high amounts of fruits and vegetables children eat in proportion 
to their weight 
the studys findings were reported last week after a summary of 
the twoyear study became public the group examined risks from the 
use of eight cancercausing pesticides on 27 fruits and vegetables 
while no lawsuit has yet been filed al meyerhoff a lawyer for 
the council said the group plans to take the matter to court 
arguing that the epa has failed to protect the public health of all 
citizens 
when the agency sets supposedly safe levels of pesticides in 
food they ignore children meyerhoff said in an interview 
the epa has challenged the findings of the study 
john moore acting deputy adminstrator said last week the epa 
analysis on allowable toxicity levels of fruits and vegetables 
already considers that children often consume large amounts of such 
foods 
the health threat to children also was disputed monday by 
representatives of the processed food industry fruit and vegetable 
industry and chemical industry as well as some physicians 
the national food processors association said it routinely 
conducts tests for pesticide residues in processed foods and has 
always found them virtually nonexistent in packaged foods and far 
below allowable levels in the few cases when detected 
the group said that a recent examination of 17843 samples of 
processed fruits and vegetables showed 92 percent with no detectable 
pesticide residues it said another test of apple products showed 
with the exception of one sample with a lowlevel amount no trace 
of the carcinogenic growthregulator daminozide 
but robin whyatt an author of the council study said the 
groups findings suggest a health risk to children she said the 
findings are based on comparing government data showing consumption 
of fruits and vegetables by preschool children and residue levels 
that have been documented on such food products 
the report said as many as 5500 to 6200 children among the 
current preschool population may eventualy get cancer solely as a 
result of their exposure before 6 years of age this represents a 
chance of 5 children in 20000 getting cancer from such exposure 
250 times greater than the one in a million considered allowable by 
the epa in its risk analysis for the entire population 
john mccarthy vice president of the national agricultural 
chemicals association called the nrdc study misleading and said it 
was based on a worstcase scenario that does not represent real 
world experience 
the chemicals in question have been widely used for more than 
25 years yet available data show that the incidence of cancers that 
could be attributed to overexposure to chemicals in the food supply 
is not increasing mccarthy said

three tribal leaders told a senate panel that 
the bureau of indian affairs still has a role to play despite 
charges of neglect and corruption aired in a series of hearings 
if your car quits running you dont discard it you fix it 
john taylor chief of the eastern band of cherokee told a special 
investigative unit of the senate select committee on indian affairs 
on monday 
the tribal leaders were asked at the conclusion of the round of 
hearings whether the bureau should be abolished 
taylor whose tribe lives in the mountains of north carolina 
said he is proud of his tribes economic selfsufficiency but he 
doesnt think all tribes could survive without the bia we can 
make the bia accountable he said 
the bureau came under heavy criticism as the committee looked 
into contracting fraud and child abuse on indian reservations and 
organized crime infiltration into legal indian gambling operations 
such as bingo 
bia witnesses who testified since the hearings began jan 30 
generally showed little knowledge of the problems or admitted 
failing to act quickly when abuse was revealed 
ivan l sidney chairman of the hopi tribe in arizona said he 
believes the bia will someday be unnecessary whether it be next 
year 10 years 20 years 
but he said as the tribes work toward total sovereignty they 
must continue to work with the federal government 
our relationship is with the federal government not with the 
states sidney said i believe a special assistant to the 
president will assist us in the effort to minimize the bias role 
last week the three senators who comprise the special committee 
asked president bush to put a staff person in the white house in 
charge of indian affairs there has been no response yet 
i think there needs to be a presence because of our 
relationship with the us government said john washakie chief 
of the shoshone and arapho tribes in wyoming but he said it could 
be minimized 
in closing the session sen dennis deconcini dariz who 
chairs the committee called the hearings on child sexual abuse a 
case study on the shortcomings of the bia and the ihs indian health 
service 
the bia has been grossly negligent in protecting the resource 
that american indians care about most deeply their families 
deconcini said 
deconcini said that he and his fellow committee members sens 
thomas daschle dsd and john mccain rariz agree that 
increased accountability is the key to strengthening indian 
selfdetermination 
william ragsdale acting head of the bureau of indian affairs 
told the committee he is sending a letter of apology from the 
department of interior to the hopi tribe and any others whose 
children were sexually abused by bia employees 
ragsdale said monday that the insensitivity of some school 
officials to parents whose children had been molested was 
inexcusable 
i started my career in the indian bureau as a school teacher 
said ragsdale it is difficult for me to understand why our system 
totally broke down 
ragsdale said that part of the breakdown in the bia school system 
could be blamed on congress he referred to a law which changed the 
organizational structure of the bia and required that the 115 or 
120 bia schools across the country report directly to washington 
thats too much of a span of control for anyone to handle he 
said 
deconcini said that over the next few months the special 
committee will continue its probe into other aspects of indian 
affairs including natural resource management the indian health 
service management trust funds indian education and hud indian 
housing programs

the technician who runs the electronically 
complex sound systems for rock n roll bands is a creative artist 
with first amendment protections according to arguments before the 
us supreme court 
at issue is a requirement in new york city that it supply those 
technicians for central parks naumburg bandshell 
the city has required performers to use a citysupplied sound 
system and technician since 1986 to control sound levels inside the 
parks designated quiet zones and make sure that noise doesnt 
bleed out into surrounding neighborhoods 
but attorney william kunstler told the high court on monday i 
think this is a curb on creativity this is an attempt to regulate 
free expression 
the flamboyant attorney who has made a career defending radicals 
and other unpopular cases is representing a promoter called rock 
against racism which has sponsored rock concerts in the naumburg 
bandshell since 1979 
kunstler argued that the sound technician who controls the 
volume of the instruments and the balance among the sounds is an 
intrinsic artistic part of a band 
to replace a rock groups own mixer as a means of controlling the 
sound level is akin to the citys deciding to replace the conductor 
of the new york philharmonic with the music director of the chicago 
symphony orchestra he contended 
they want to put georg solti in for zubin mehta thats what 
theyre saying kunstler told the justices 
but a city lawyer argued that rock against racism had not 
originally made the argument that the sound person was an artistic 
part of the band and said the cityhired sound technician had been 
used by 50 to 60 performers at the bandshell in 1986 without a 
problem 
every group was satisfied said leonard j koerner chief 
assistant corporation counsel koerner also argued that it has 
proven unworkable to have a city technician control volume while a 
band technician works the sound mix 
some things happen in the heat of battle that dont follow a 
neat and orderly pattern he said 
rock against racism challenged the citys bandshell rules in 
april 1986 the promoter lost its case at the district court level 
in april 1987 but it won an appeal in a federal circuit court in 
june 1988 the city appealed to the supreme court 
in its ruling last june the appeals court found that the citys 
approach violates performers freedom of expression but city 
officials called the ruling unrealistic and hinted it might even 
cause a riot if it leaves officials with no choice other than 
pulling the plug on a concert that got too loud 
a supreme court ruling is expected sometime before july

longdistance telephone callers in airports 
hospitals hotels and other public places will be getting more 
information on whose service theyre using and how much it will 
cost but no price break 
the federal communications commission on monday ordered five 
companies that provide socalled alternative operator service to 
provide more consumer information the fcc also told those companies 
they must not block callers from using other longdistance carriers 
the fcc said 
however the fcc decided not to regulate alternative operator 
service rates which have caused numerous complaints from those 
making collect or credit card calls who sometimes get a big surprise 
when they receive their bill later at home 
the fcc action was in response to a complaint filed by two 
consumer groups telecommunications research and action center and 
consumer action against central corp international telecharge 
inc national telephone services inc payline systems inc and 
telesphere network inc 
providers of alternative operator services typically lease lines 
from a longdistance carrier and then provide their own operators to 
connect callers with that longdistance company businesses that use 
the alternative operator services for their pay phones get a 
commission from each call 
gerald brock chief of the fccs common carrier bureau said the 
fcc had ordered the companies to 
provide information on or near the telephone that an operator 
call will go through a certain company and indicate how to contact 
that company for rate information 
make their operators identify what company they are with and 
then give callers an opportunity to hang up without any charge 
refrain from call blocking in which a hotel for example will 
place all its longdistance calls through a particular operator the 
alternative operator services companies cannot prevent callers from 
using atampt for example if they choose to do so 
brock said an industry panel also will be asked how to solve the 
problem of call splashing in which an alternative operator 
services provider uses an operator in denver for example to handle 
a call from los angeles to new york if the caller decides not to 
use that operator the operator will hand off the call to another 
longdistance operator in denver and the caller will get a bill for 
a call from denver to new york instead of los angeles to new york 
but brock said the commission would allow the marketplace to set 
rates 
we believe that we are not the appropriate ones to limit the 
consumer options brock said so long as the consumers have a 
choice then we assume that they will choose the carrier that is of 
most value to them given the combination of service characteristics 
and prices charged a consumer who believes that an aos 
companys rates are too high should use a different carrier 
brock said mondays ruling is separate from a recent decision by 
a federal judge that owners of buildings where public phones are 
located must choose by april 1 which company will provide 
longdistance service

the government has decided to make it easier 
for lowincome people to qualify for subsidized telephone service 
the federal communications commission decided monday that 
lowincome applicants for subsidized telephone service no longer 
will have to show theyve had no phone for the previous three months 
or that theyve received no federal phone aid for two years 
the fcc said those requirements for link up america aid were 
denying service to 15 percent of all applicants 
the yearold federal assistance plan is designed to encourage 
lowincome households to get telephone service by helping pay for 
installation 
qualifying households may receive up to 30 to help defray such 
costs 
gerald brock chief of the fccs common carrier bureau said 
there were 385000 people in 37 states the district of columbia and 
puerto rico in the program 
brock said the commission decided to loosen the requirements when 
it was shown it would not cost the government very much 
we are finding that it has been an effective program but it has 
not been so well used that the financial requirements were 
overwhelming brock told reporters

the food and drug administration has issued 
standards for expectorants in nonprescription coughcold medicines 
that allow only one proven active ingredient to remain on the market 
guaifenesin was the only ingredient found by the fda to be safe 
and effective in increasing sputum or phlegm volume and making it 
easier to cough up 
it is the most widely used active ingredient used in expectorants 
and is contained in the major brands of coughcold medicines the 
fda said 
about 20 other expectorant ingredients were found not to be 
useful and products using these ingredients will have to be 
reformulated or taken off the market within one year the fda said 
eight products listed in the handbook of nonprescription drugs would 
fall into this category 
among the 20 ingredients are ammonium chloride a plant extract

boeing is telling 747 operators to check cargo 
doors like the one that ripped off a jumbo jet out of honolulu but 
federal authorities say they have no plans to rush mandatory cargo 
lock improvements 
airlines still have up to 16 months to strengthen cargo door 
locks even though boeing first recommended the change in august 
1987 after a door popped open on a pan am 747 
investigators of the incident friday that sent nine united air 
lines flight 811 passengers to their deaths over the pacific ocean 
were homing in on the possibility of a malfunctioning cargo door 
the accident left a 10by20foot hole in the side of the 
18yearold aircraft 
boeing on sunday sent notices to 747 operators around the world 
to recheck their planes cargo doors although spokesman david 
jimenez said this did not imply any conclusion as to the cause of 
the honolulu incident 
lee dickinson a national transportion safety board investigator 
said various electrical problems were reported in december and the 
jumbo jets door had to be closed manually in january a seal on 
the cargo door was repaired he said dickinson refused to speculate 
on the seriousness of the door repairs but said it is proper to 
close this door manually 
the federal aviation administration ordered prompt inspections 
and any necesssary repairs of the doors on older usregistered 
747s last july but it gave airlines either 18 months or two years 
to strengthen undamaged cargo locks depending on the type of lock 
on each airliner 
first of all weve got to find out what happened before 
considering any revisions in the order faa spokesman fred farrar 
said 
flight data and cockpit voice recorders arrived at the national 
transportation safety board in washington on monday for analysis and 
transcription 
the recorders contain data from sensors throughout the aircraft 
voices and other noises that might add to information about the 
incident 
matthew finucane air safety director for the association of 
flight attendants said the union thinks the faa as a general 
rule is too generous in the time frames for its mandatory safety 
reforms 
despite the lack of federal urgency united and at least one 
other airline were stepping up inspections of the cargo door locks 
others said they already had made the changes ordered by the faa 
united officials said mechanics had inspected all the fleets 31 
747s and found no cargo door defects nonetheless the airline was 
assigning mechanics to check the doors before each flight 
the change had not yet been made on the united 747 used on flight 
811 before fridays incident airline officials said 
northwest airlines began precautionary inspections of cargo doors 
on sunday said spokesman bob gibbons and intends to complete them 
on the 26 affected planes by tonight improved locks had earlier 
been installed on 15 other jumbo jets he said 
pan am said through spokesman jeffrey kriendler that it was in 
full compliance with the order for its 35 jumbo jets before the 
accident 
trans world airlines had already modified cargo door systems on 
all 19 of its jumbo jets said spokesman don morrison but on 
saturday he said the airline ordered beefed up surveillance of 
the cargo door area for all twa flights using 747s 
the july order required prompt inspections of locks after a pan 
am jets front cargo door opened slightly during a march 1987 
flight causing no damage or injuries 
boeing had recommended the alterations in service bulletins dated 
aug 27 1987 and april 14 1988 
the possibility of a cargo door failure raises a problem the us 
aviation industry thought it had licked years ago and one that is 
separate from recent concern over aging aircraft and terrorist bombs 
although recent cargo door problems have not been given urgency 
by the faa earlier cargo door incidents were more serious and led 
to a series of faa orders and industry changes 
when a turkish air dc10 crashed near paris in 1974 killing 346 
people investigators determined that the loss of the cargo door 
caused sudden depressurization buckling the floor of the aircraft 
and snapping control cables 
since then floors have been strengthened and other design 
changes made in both the dc10s manufactured by mcdonnell douglas 
and in boeing 747s

irans parliament voted today to give 
britain a week to alter its reaction to ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeinis death decree against author salman rushdie or ties will 
be severed the government news agency said 
in an earlier dispatch the official islamic republic news agency 
said parliament had voted to break diplomatic ties with britain 
which last week recalled its diplomats from tehran to protest 
khomeinis death sentence 
britain also asked irans envoys to leave london 
khomeini on feb 14 ordered moslems to seek out and kill rushdie 
for his novel the satanic verses many moslems consider the book 
blasphemous 
fourteen other western nations including west germany have 
withdrawn their top diplomats from iran in the furor over khomeinis 
death decree 
irna monitored in nicosia said nearly all of the 201 
deputies present in the 270member majlis or parliament voted fore 
the measure standing and cheering and praising the prophet mohammed 
and his descendants 
to become law the bill must be approved by the council of 
guardians a group of six islamic religious leaders and six lawyers 
that irna said would likely convene today to consider the measure 
britain and iran all but broke ties after an iranian diplomat was 
arrested on shoplifting charges in britain in may 1987 and a british 
diplomat was detained and beaten in retaliation 
they restored ties late last year with britain reopening its 
embassy building in december for the first time in eight years 
khomeini said last week that the policy of restoring irans 
contacts with the west pursued by the moderates in the government 
was a mistake because the west was constantly hatching plots against 
iran

attackers raided a sinhalese village of 
rice farmers in eastern sri lanka shooting or hacking to death at 
least 32 people nine of them children officials said today 
police and military officials blamed the attack on a separatist 
tamil guerrilla group but a spokesman for the group denied 
responsibility 
the target of monday nights attack was the village of welikande 
in the polonnaruwa district about 100 miles northeast of colombo 
according to the police who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a military official in colombo said the bodies of 19 men four 
women and nine children were found he said most of the victims 
were hacked to death but some of the men were shot he said two 
village men were also missing 
the police blamed the attack on the liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam the most powerful of the tamil separatist groups that have 
been waging a bloody campaign of guerrilla warfare and massacres 
since 1983 
the ethnic struggle against the sinhalese majority of this island 
off the southern tip of india has claimed more than 8500 lives 
the welikande attack was the third massacre this month blamed on 
the tigers in northeastern sri lanka at least 75 people died in the 
three attacks 
on feb 11 in dutuwewa 36 sinhalese were shot and stabbed to 
death on feb 22 at sinhapura seven sinhalese were killed 
the tigers information office in london denied the first two 
attacks were the work of their people in telexes to colombo 
newspapers the tigers blamed the dutuwewa and sinhapura raids on 
quislings of the indian government trying to discredit the 
tigers 
a tiger leader telephoned the associated press on monday to deny 
his men were behind the welikande killings speaking of all three 
attacks he said these killings are being done by armed groups 
who want to discredit our just struggle on behalf of the tamil 
people 
speaking on condition of anonymity he added they are being 
done to give the indian occupationary forces and the sri lankan army 
and police a right to kill tamils he did not elaborate 
an indian peacekeeping force has been deployed in sri lanka since 
the summer of 1987 in an effort to disarm the tigers 
a former tamil rebel leader from a rival group claimed the tigers 
were on a headlinehunting exercise 
vartharaja perumal now chief minister of the northeastern 
administrative council said the tigers had been badly mauled by 
indian troops and were showing off their fangs by killing innocent 
sinhalese 
perumal used to be the leader of the eelam peoples revolutionary 
liberation front which once fought alongside the tigers but now 
says it has surrendered its arms in an effort to enter the political 
mainstream 
he is in colombo this week to press his demands for the 
government to embark on a promised rehabilitation project for the 
predominantly tamil northeast 
tamils who are mostly hindus comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 
16 million people and say they are discriminated against in jobs and 
education by the sinhalese majority that dominates the government 
and military 
sinhalese who are mostly buddhists account for 75 percent of 
the population there also is a small moslem minority and an even 
smaller christian community

environmentalists workers and lawmakers 
welcomed an agreement to clean up the nations most contaminated 
nuclear weapons production site but said they would have to fight 
for the billions of dollars needed to do the job 
state and federal officials at a washington dc signing 
ceremony monday said the landmark agreement will provide a clear 
road map for cleaning up the 570squaremile hanford nuclear 
reservation and serve as a model for other energy department weapons 
plants 
its an amiable agreement which is long overdue said mike 
fox head of the hanford family a group of about 300 hanford 
workers relatives and supporters 
under the agreement the department has promised to seek 28 
billion for the cleanup over five years but the appropriation has 
yet to be endorsed by the bush administrations office of management 
and budget and submitted to congress for approval 
after five years the agreement calls for the state and the 
energy department to come up with additional requests to finance 
continued cleanup which the department estimates could cost 57 
billion 
the cost means we need to win 19 billion per year in this 
era of budget deficitfighting in order for this agreement to clean 
up hanford within 30 years said gerald pollett who has been 
lobbying for a cleanup on behalf of heart of america northwest 
we are still going to have to fight for these funds said 
rep les aucoin dore a member of the house appropriations 
committee 
key provisions of the 300page agreement include 
an accelerated program for cleaning up hanford over 30 years 
rather than 50 years as originally envisioned 
specific cleanup milestones with fines against the energy 
department of up to 10000 a week if it fails to meet the goals 
clear delineation of duties between the state the energy 
department and the federal environmental protection agency 
justice department agreement to allow enforcement through 
lawsuits filed by the state or private parties 
the federal government also agreed to provide the state with 29 
million during the next three years to pay for monitoring 
the agreement followed more than a year of negotiations and state 
threats to go to court if the talks failed 
the energy department released documents estimating that 5 
billion cubic yards of hazardous solid and liquid wastes both 
radioactive and toxic have been dumped at hanford which straddles

a consortium of businesses and research 
institutions hopes a visit to albuquerque will be like life on 
another planet for some space engineers and scientists in the 1990s 
the national aeronautics and space administration is expected to 
decide by 1992 whether to recommend lunar colonization or a manned 
mission to mars in the early 21st century 
in preparation los alamos national laboratory the university of 
new mexico the air force the army corps of engineers and several 
new mexico businesses are proposing the nations first 
extraterrestrial environment simulator in albuquerque at an 
estimated cost of about 55 million 
this fits right in with lovelace medical center in 
albuquerque picking the mercury astronauts los alamos spokesman 
jeff schwartz said in a telephone interview monday new mexico has 
been at the frontier of the space age since there was a space age 
members of the consortium met here monday with nasa officials to 
discuss the project called the center for extraterrestrial 
engineering and construction or cetec talks were expected to 
continue all week 
steve howe a program coordinator in los alamos energy and 
technology initiatives office said its possible to have cetec 
operating in 1 to two years he estimated a sixyear cost of about 
55 million 
thats less than a million a year he said 
about 65 scientists engineers contractors and government 
officials attended mondays session howe said 
he said the basic configuration of cetec would be a couple of 
tanks doing teleoperated or robotic experiments vacuum tanks 
that would simulate the conditions on the moon where theres no 
atmosphere 
he said experiments would address several key questions 
how do you dig how do you drill how do you lay foundations 
can you make concrete out of the soil can you make structural glass 
out of the soil can you extract oxygen from the soil to manufacture 
fuel 
consortium members would put up about 2 million worth of 
equipment land and expertise he said noting that the air force 
already has the 60footlong 16footdiameter steel vacuum tubes 
needed for the project at kirtland air force base in albuquerque 
we are ready to contribute that if nasa comes in and says were 
ready to go howe said 
he said rock formations in minnesota and iceland closely match 
lunar composition and would be imported for the experiments 
jerry leigh senior technical adviser for unms new mexico 
engineering research institute said the university is prepared to 
donate land in its academic research park south of kirtland howe 
said the site would be 2 to 5 acres and unms land offer is a 
selling point to nasa 
he said the nasa has been encouraging 
they clearly have other proposals and to that extent they are 
neutral but we feel were kind of aware of nasas position and 
theyre providing very good input as to where the national space 
program may be going

us troops today blocked south korean 
dissidents who were trying to reach the panmunjom border truce site 
to organize unsanctioned reunification talks with representatives of 
communist north korea 
culture and information minister choe byungyul warned in a 
statement that the government will be compelled to take 
countermeasures should the dissidents try to meet with north 
korean officials at the border 
he did not elaborate 
the 30 dissidents blocked today were trying to get to nearby 
panmunjom to arrange a pannational congress for wednesday the 
radical united national democratic movement of korea or 
chonminnyon had stated its intention to hold such a meeting 
wednesday at panmunjom with 10 delegates from each side 
the us troops who help guard the area held back the dissidents 
who tried to force their way through one gate at the site and rush a 
second gate until south korean police removed the protesters a 
us military spokesman said 
the american soldiers who help guard the panmunjom border site 
are among 42000 washington has in south korea under a mutual 
defense pact 
the democratic movement embracing about 200 radical groups in 
the south proposed the wednesday meeting in january and north 
koreas committee for the peaceful unification of the fatherland 
accepted it feb 15 
choe the chief government spokesman said the government wants 
to make it clear that it will never tolerate the arbitrary attempts 
by chonminnyon or any other organization to contact north korea 
without consulting the authorities on an important issue like 
unification of the two koreas 
he said attempts to call a pannational congress at this 
juncture would in no way serve to improve southnorth relations and 
would only lead the north koreans to misjudge the situation 
north and south korea have been holding talks on trying to 
improve relations the north has been demanding a halt to annual 
ussouth korean military exercises before agreeing to further 
progress 
choe also said chonminnyons attempts to work with the north 
korean committee an affiliate of the north korean communist party 
to convene a pannational congress would only encourage the norths 
strategy of causing chaos in the south 
chonminnyon which takes an antigovernment antius stand 
maintains that the government has no right to monopolize 
interkorean dialogue it charges that the government is not 
sincerely interested in seeking unification with the north through 
dialogue 
panmunjom is a restricted area inside the demilitarized zone that 
separates the capitalist south from the north the two koreas were 
divided in 1945 at the end of world war ii

the philippine government has sold for 37 
million a manhattan condominium said to have been owned by deposed 
president ferdinand marcos and it is seeking buyers for two other 
properties 
the sevenbedroom apartment on the 43rd floor of the olympic 
towers a glass tower next to st patricks cathedral on fifth 
avenue was sold monday to an unidentified buyer said teresa roxas 
spokeswoman for the philippine commission on good government 
the property was surrendered to the philippine government in 1986 
by a marcos associate antonio floirendo as part of a deal to avoid 
prosecution 
the condominium was among holdings allegedly purchased with some 
of the 10 billion that the philippine government claims marcos and 
his associates stole from the nations treasury before he was ousted 
and fled to hawaii in 1986 
marcos wife imelda has pleaded innocent in new york to federal 
racketeering charges and is free on 5 million bail lawyers have

some need help in tracking down 
missing spouses others appeal for government benefits and they 
come to president corazon aquino as their court of last resort 
every year thousands of ordinary filipinos turn to mrs aquino 
as they did to her predecessors for help with the mundane problems 
of life and in sidestepping a bloated cumbersome bureaucracy and 
ineffectual local government 
they might not be the sort of problems that would involve the 
white house 
but in a paternalistic society tradition demands that the boss 
take care of subordinates the president is not only expected to 
wrestle with complex issues of statecraft but also unravel red tape 
and intercede on behalf of the average filipino 
with a historical background of colonialism and a succession of 
governorsgeneral in spanish and american times the datus native 
chiefs and sultans before that the filipino has been oriented to a 
strong oneman leadership as the source of all solutions wrote 
commentator luis beltran in the manila standard 
ricardo galing director of the presidential office of public 
assistance said his department processed more than 30000 requests 
for assistance in 1987 the last year when complete records were 
available 
the office was established in the 1950s and maintains a staff of 
about 100 people to help with citizen complaints 
galing said some of the appeals come from town mayors village 
officials and even congressmen seeking help from constituents but 
most come from ordinary people he said 
about 80 percent of those who come here to ask the government 
for help are our brothers and sisters in the depressed areas of the 
country galing said 
he said the most common requests involve applications for 
government jobs medical assistance or resolving rental labor and 
property disputes 
a few seek help in marital disputes or tracking down spouses who 
went abroad for work and disappeared he said there were no figures 
on how many problems had been resolved to the satisfaction of the 
applicant 
sometimes we just refer walkins to the proper government 
office and call ahead to say that soandso is on his way and to 
help them galing said sometimes we have to refer the problem 
in writing for a response 
others put their problems directly to mrs aquino in her weekly 
radio broadcast ask the president which the government radio 
network carries every sunday night 
the governments philippine information agency solicits and 
screens the questions mrs aquino answers about a dozen of them 
every week but sometimes short of what the supplicants had hoped 
for 
one caller alberto tangapa of cagayan de oro appealed recently 
for a government job so he could overcome the injustices our 
family had suffered due to the cruel society to which we belong 
please submit your application to the department of labor 
mrs aquino replied if you are qualified and if there are 
available positions you may be hired 
during another recent broadcast a resident of rizal province 
complained that his neighbors fence was blocking the pathway to his 
home 
the mayor knows what they are doing is illegal but they wont 
stop it he complained what can we do 
before i give a rightful answer to your problem i first want 
to know all the details mrs aquino responded she ordered the 
land management bureau to look into the dispute

more than half the states may be barred 
beginning wednesday from burying hazardous waste in south carolina 
unless they supply information on their own disposal laws officials 
say 
gov carroll campbell who set the march 1 deadline in january 
said states would have to certify that they had no impediments to 
disposal within their borders or that the repeal of such 
impediments was imminent to be allowed to continue sending their 
waste to south carolina 
the order affects south carolinas gsx landfill which holds 
close to a billion pounds of hazardous waste about 70 percent from 
out of state some 33 states puerto rico and the district of 
columbia used the facility in 1987 
state environmental officials sent letters to all 50 states and 
puerto rico informing them of campbells order by monday 
afternoon only 23 states had responded 
our policy has to be flexible enough to work with a state that 
is genuinely moving to eliminate prohibitions campbell said 
monday but he said i look for us to reach a point where there 
will be some states that will be cut off 
campbell said he hoped to see regional agreements that eliminated 
impediments to waste treatment or burial and arrangements where one 
state might handle a material that another state doesnt 
the question is do you have a fair load sharing thats the 
kind of fairness were looking for in this area he said 
nine states north carolina florida massachusetts rhode 
island pennsylvania new jersey kentucky louisiana and kansas 
accounted for about 40 percent of the waste going to gsx officials 
said 
hartsill truesdale head of the department of health and 
environmental controls hazardous waste divison would not say which 
states had replied 
gsx is one of only two commercial hazardous waste landfills in 
the southeast and accepts roughly 135000 tons of chemical garbage 
annually the other landfill is in alabama

israeli warplanes today bombed and 
rocketed the chouf mountains southeast of beirut and police said 
two palestinian guerrillas were killed and 33 people were injured 
including 26 children 
a police spokesman said the casualties were reported in the 
village of ainab 10 miles southeast of beirut he said the dead 
guerrillas were members of naif hawatmehs democratic front for the 
liberation of palestine a marxist plo faction 
the spokesman who cannot be named under police regulations said 
the children were wounded by shrapnel and flying glass in ainabs 
elementary school about 200 yards from the base of the guerrilla 
group 
he said a rocket fired by one of six israeli jets slammed into an 
empty lot about 25 yards south of the school 
the police spokesman said the jets also strafed bases belonging 
to syrianbacked guerrilla factions near the druse villages of 
shemlan aitat and bayssour those targets are about eight miles 
southeast of beirut 
democratic front spokesman suheil natour said the groups base in 
ainab took several direct hits 
he said the front stresses its determination to step up the 
struggle and military strikes against israeli occupation forces 
us state department spokesman charles redman said monday that 
democratic front raids have a negative impact on the dialogue 
between washington and the palestine liberation organization 
the six israeli fighterbombers staged at least three bomb and 
rocket attacks in 30 minutes police said 
an israeli military spokesman said in jerusalem that the raid was 
directed against a command headquarters of the democratic front and 
that all the jets returned safely after destroying their targets 
palestinian druse and shiite moslem militia gunners fired 
antiaircraft guns at the raiding planes from positions in the 
mountains and around beirut international airport but no hits were 
reported police said 
air traffic was brought to a standstill at the airport during the 
raid israels third on lebanon this year the police spokesman said 
the israeli said the air raids target was used as headquarters 
for guerrillas and as a point for organizing and launching attacks 
against israel and against israeli targets in israels 
selfproclaimed security zone in south lebanon 
the air strike coincided with the 20th anniversary of the 
establishment of the democratic front which lost three guerrillas 
in a confrontation with israeliallied militiamen in south lebanon 
on thursday 
an israeli foreign ministry official said thursdays attack was 
another example of the inability of the plo to fulfill its 
declared statement of stopping terror 
plo chief yasser arafat denounced terrorism during a meeting of 
the palestine national council in november the plo maintains the 
denunciation does not cover guerrilla attacks against israeli 
military targets 
at least 128 people were killed and 356 wounded in 25 israeli air 
raids on lebanon last year

the doctor who wrote a letter attesting that john 
tower shows no signs of alcoholism says he didnt know it would be 
used in a public campaign to rescue the former senators nomination 
as defense secretary 
dr warren lichliter said he learned from reporters sunday that 
tower had read a portion of the letter in tv interviews 
the letter said an examination after towers recent colon surgery 
showed no evidence at all of alcoholic impairment or alcoholism 
lichliter who is on the staff of dallas baylor university 
medical center is not towers primary physician he said he 
prepared the letter because dr rd dignan who removed a benign 
lump from towers colon in january was out of town when towers 
staff called and he routinely takes calls in dignans absence 
lichliter said he spoke sunday with dignan and dignan backs the 
letter 100 percent 
dignan issued a statement earlier this month saying tests 
indicated no abnormalities within organ systems that might be 
involved with alcohol abuse 
calls to both doctors offices monday were referred to steve 
habgood baylor university medical center spokesman 
both have indicated that their previous statements stand as 
is habgood said 
tower a republican former senator from texas pledged to swear 
off alcohol if approved as defense secretary 
allegations of a drinking problem were among the factors cited 
when the democratcontrolled senate armed services committee voted 
119 along party lines thursday to recommend that the full senate

as a fire break officials said

the fire burn itself out said jim whitson state forestry officer

their original demands are met including abandonment of planned 
changes in the constitution 
the government imposed emergency measures in kosovo province on 
monday

kosovos slav minority occupied their pits to protest the

konrad lorenz the austrian scientist who 
won a nobel prize for his pioneering studies of human and animal 
behavior has died at age 85 
the austrian academy of sciences said today that lorenz died 
monday night at his home at altenburg about 30 miles northeast of 
vienna the austria press agency said he died of kidney failure 
lorenz was the countrys most famous scientist he held 
doctorates in medicine zoology and psychology 
in 1973 his studies on the organization of individual and group 
behavior patterns won him the nobel prize in medicine together with 
karl von frisch and nikolaas tinbergen 
lorenz turned to research in animal behavior shortly after 
obtaining his medical degree he had become an animal lover as a 
child collecting a variety of animals at his expansive boyhood home 
outside vienna 
the collection included fish dogs monkeys insects and 
especially ducks and geese 
his first important findings concerned the social life of birds 
those studies convinced him that many aspects of the birds behavior 
were innate and instinctive rather than learned 
his views were controversial and they became even more 
controversial when he suggested that such instinctive behavior might 
be important in humans too 
one of his best known findings was that young animals will at 
some time in their lives become strongly attached to their 
biological mothers a process known as imprinting 
he showed that the process could be altered however by 
demonstrating that mallard ducklings would happily follow a human 
who greeted them shortly after birth and imitated a mothers 
quacking 
born in vienna on nov 7 1903 the son of a surgeon lorenz was 
awarded his first doctorate in medicine at age 25 further studies 
in zoology and psychology followed in vienna and new york 
culminating in a 1933 doctorate based on his research on the 
behavior of birds 
in 1939 lorenz was given a chair in psychology at the 
prestigious immanuel kant university in koenigsberg then a german 
town and today the soviet port of kaliningrad 
his tenure there and publications during that time led in later 
years to allegations that lorenz was a nazi sympathizer 
when accepting the nobel prize he apologized for a 1940 
publication judged to reflect nazi views of science saying that 
many highly decent scientists hoped like i did for a short time 
for good from national socialism and many quickly turned away from 
it with the same horror as i 
after world war ii lorenz returned to vienna where he lectured 
at the university and published dozens of books 
one of his most controversial publications was the 1966 study 
on aggression in which he asserted that aggressive impulses are 
to some degree innate drawing on analogies between human and animal 
behavior 
later bestselling books included the eight deadly sins of 
civilized humanity a plea against overpopulation and 
environmental destruction and the decay of the humane a gloomy 
look at mankinds future that sold 390000 copies

drug abuse among high school seniors continued 
to decline last year and reached its lowest level since 1975 a 
national survey released today showed 
the national high school seniors survey found a significant drop 
in cocaine use for the second year in a row as well as a decrease in 
use of crack cocaine and continuation of the gradual decline in use 
of marijuana 
we can safely say that these decreases suggest that high school 
seniors are hearing the messages about cocaines dangers and are 
avoiding drug use in general said charles r schuster director 
of the national institute on drug abuse sponsor of the survey 
however drug abuse in our youth still remains a major public 
health problem he said noting that one of every eight high 
school seniors tries cocaine before graduation and one of every two 
seniors has used an illegal drug at least once 
the survey which has been conducted by the university of 
michigans institute for social research every year since 1975 
found that the proportion of high school seniors who reported having 
ever used an illegal drug dropped to 539 percent in 1988 that is 
the lowest level recorded since the survey began when the rate was 
552 percent 
while the use of marijuana has been declining since a peak of 
277 percent in the high school class of 1979 the level reported 
for last year 214 percent remains higher than the rate of 19 
percent reported in the first year of the survey 
the proportion of seniors who have used cocaine at least once 
dropped from 15 percent in 1987 to 12 percent in 1988 and the 
proportion who said they had used cocaine at least once in the last 
30 days dropped from 43 percent in 1987 to 34 percent in 1988 
the survey also showed that 40 percent of those who had tried 
cocaine also have used crack a cheap and highly addictive form of 
cocaine however the proportion of those who said they had used 
crack at least once dropped from 56 percent in 1987 to 48 percent 
last year 
some 16300 high school seniors from 135 schools nationwide were 
questioned for the survey

a racially divided boston school committee has 
adopted a plan allowing parents to choose the schools their children 
attend but blacks vowed to fight it charging it will mean 
resegregation of the citys schools 
the nine whites on the committee voted for the plan monday night 
the four blacks voted against and one of them john obryant said 
were going to end up where we were in court 
opponents said it may resegregate schools supporters said 
resegregation is not an issue because less than 25 percent of the 
systems 55000 students are white 
us district judge w arthur garrity jr ordered bostons 
schools desegregated in 1974 resulting in many students being bused 
outside their neighborhoods to achieve racial balance the busing 
resulted in violent protests by whites 
garrity relinquished control over the nations oldest school 
system in 1985 but the busing plan has remained in effect 
the new plan divides the city into three zones each designed to 
include people of all backgrounds 
parents will be given a choice of schools within the zone in 
which they live and will get their choice unless it causes 
overcrowding or upsets a schools racial balance 
the plan calls for all schools to reflect the racial breakdown in 
its zone 
black members of the school committee threatened to file a 
federal lawsuit to block the plan 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
the main plaintiff in the 1974 desegregation case said the plan 
does not ensure that schools will improve 
louis elisa vice president of the boston chapter of the naacp 
called the plan the moral equivalent of a cheap coat of paint on 
an old rusted brokendown car of segregation 
the car cannot move forward and the paint will not last he 
said 
school committeeman daniel burke said this plan is no panacea 
but its a start charles willie a consultant hired by mayor 
raymond l flynn to draft a student assignment plan said it is 
light years ahead of what we have now 
the plan becomes effective in september for students entering 
kindergarten through grade 6 and the following september for other 
students 
the original busing order was prompted by a lawsuit filed by 
black parents garrity had found that the school committee was 
operating an unconstitutional segregated system with black 
students often going to inferior schools

drought poses a serious threat for california 
and the next month or two could be crucial to the states water 
picture the national weather service reported today 
the snowpack in california is well below normal posing the 
potential for significant water supply problems in the state this 
summer said dr michael d hudlow director of hydrology for the 
weather service 
the potential for drought also exists in the missouri valley in 
the boston and new york metropolitan areas and in the delaware river 
basin hudlow said 
on the other hand saturated soils pose the danger of severe 
flooding in the ohio and mississippi valleys he warned 
in addition there is a danger of snowmelt flooding in the 
northernmost portions of north dakota wisconsin and minnesota the 
upper peninsula of michigan and in northernmost new york and new 
england hudlow said 
but the spring flood and water supply report from the weather 
service singled out california as the region for the greatest 
concern because of the low mountain snowpack the source of the 
majority of the states water supply 
a continued drought in california this summer would bring the 
state its third consecutive dry year hudlow said that has not 
occurred before in this century 
there was some good news included in the report however with 
the 30 and 90day forecasts giving california a slightly above 
normal chance of precipitation in the coming months

the tennessee supreme court has outlawed 
charity bingo dealing a setback to churches veterans organizations 
and other groups 
the high court monday said that the state constitution bars the 
legislature from authorizing lotteries and that bingo for charity 
or any other reason is a lottery 
state sen steve cohen said he will push a bill to let voters 
remove the section of the constitution 
charitable bingo first was authorized in 1973 the supreme court 
said 
secretary of state gentry crowell began a crackdown in 1987 on 
what he contended were violations of bingo regulations citing a 
study that concluded only about 2 percent of the 447 million taken 
in in 1986 could be traced to charity 
i wouldnt anticipate that there will be enforcement at this 
point nashville district attorney torry johnson said of teh 
ruling 
i think it will take some time for the state attorney generals 
office to review the opinion and recommend what steps must be 
taken

local governments may be forced to pay monetary 
damages to people whose rights are violated by inadequately trained 
public employees the supreme court ruled unanimously today 
ruling in a case from canton ohio the justices said cities and 
towns may be held legally accountable if the inadequate training 
stemmed from governmental deliberate indifference 
in an opinion by justice byron r white the court said the 
inadequate training also must be closely related to the ultimate 
injury suffered before local governments can be forced to pay 
damages 
the ruling although a potential threat to municipal treasuries 
nationwide might not result in numerous successful lawsuits 
white said the court was imposing a stringent standard for those 
filing such suits because any lesser standard would open local 
governments to unprecedented liability and saddle federal courts 
with an endless exercise of secondguessing municipal 
employeetraining programs 
past supreme court decisions had made clear that a muchused 
federal civil rights law could not be used to sue a local government 
every time one of its employees violated someones rights the court 
previously had ruled that the local government is not liable unless 
the injury stemmed from some unconstitutional official policy 
but in todays ruling the court for the first time ruled that a 
local governments valid official policy can be challenged 
successfully in court if the policy is subverted by inadequate 
training 
the decision is a setback but not a final defeat for canton 
officials who sought to kill a lawsuit by a woman who says police 
violated her rights by failing to get needed medical attention for 
her after she was arrested for speeding 
geraldine harris sued canton over an april 26 1978 incident in 
which she was stopped for speeding while driving her teenage 
daughter to school 
police said they placed mrs harris into a patrol wagon after the 
52yearold woman became uncontrollably upset and uncooperative 
when she arrived at the police station mrs harris was lying on the 
wagons floor 
she repeatedly slumped to the stationhouse floor during a stay of 
30 or 40 minutes but police officers did not call for medical help 
saying they believed mrs harris was merely excited and would calm 
down if left alone and permitted to see her family 
when family members arrived they arranged to have mrs harris 
taken by ambulance to a hospital there she was diagnosed as 
suffering from stress reaction anxiety and depression 
she was hospitalized for a week and received subsequent 
outpatient treatment for the next year 
the harris family sued the city in federal court and a jury 
awarded mrs harris 200000 after deciding that she unreasonably 
had been denied medical attention by police 
the presiding judge told jurors that the city could be held 
liable even if the official city policy was to seek medical 
attention for those persons in custody who require it 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals although ordering a new 
trial in mrs harris case ruled that canton could be liable for 
monetary damages because its police officers were not trained 
adequately to summon medical help in such cases 
todays ruling returned mrs harris case to the 6th circuit 
court which can now order a new trial or dismiss the suit 
a second vote to send the case back to the appeals court was 
63 justices sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m 
kennedy said mrs harris suit should be dismissed 
applying the deliberate indifference test oconnor wrote for 
the three there is no evidence in the record indicating that the 
city of canton has been deliberately indifferent to the 
constitutional rights of pretrial detainees 
in the courts main opinion white wrote there are limited 
circumstances in which an allegation of a failure to train can be 
the basis for liability under federal civil rights law 
only where a municipalitys failure to train its employees in a 
relevant respect evidences a deliberate indifference to the rights 
of its inhabitants can such a shortcoming be properly thought of as 
a city policy or custom that is actionable white added 
merely negligent conduct by government policy makers and 
enforcers is not enough to hold the government accountable for 
monetary damages white said 
in other action the court 
said railroads and airlines may penalize strikers by giving 
their jobs to employees with less seniority who stay on the job or 
return to work before the strike ends 
in a 63 ruling which was a victory for trans world airlines 
justice sandra day oconnor said that such a policy of encouraging 
prestrike workers to remain on the job during the strike or to 
abandon the strike and return to work before all vacancies were 
filled is a legitimate exercise of twas peaceful economic 
power 
made it easier for the us government to turn over tax 
information to a foreign government 
the 90 ruling allows canadian officials to see financial records 
of two canadian citizens with bank accounts in washington state 
reinstated a convicted florida murderers death sentence 
saying he should have been barred from mounting a successful 
constitutional attack in federal courts 
by a 54 vote the court ruled that aubrey adams jr forfeited 
his right to challenge his sentence in federal court on grounds he 
failed to raise in state court 
adams was convicted of strangling an 8yearold girl in ocala 11 
years ago 
the cityliability case is canton vs harris 861088

spent much of their time beating the five security guards despite 
younis instructions that they stop the slades said 
ajam testified that one of the hijackers not younis pointed to 
one of the bound marshals and asked one of the female passengers 
which one do you want us to kill first 
do you want us to kill the one with the red shirt first 
ajam said the hijacker asked the female passenger 
she said no dont kill anybody testified ajam who was 
sitting one seat in front of the woman 
the hijacker apparently showing off also told the young 
woman that weve hijacked three airplanes this is our third we 
always go into palestinian camps and plant bombs ive been in a lot 
of fighting ive killed lots of people ajam said 
federal marshals acting under orders from us district judge 
aubrey e robinson jr asked media artists not to sketch ajam 
apparently in order to protect him from possible reprisal 
william l slade now 22 said the hijackers members of the 
lebanons amal militia a shiite moslem group hung pictures of amal 
leader nabih berri and iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on 
one of the aircraft walls 
william slade testifed that the hijackers pushed the sky marshals 
down in the main aisle beat them kicked them dropped bayonets on 
their backs and burned them with cigarettes 
younis came out of the cockpit several times ordered the other 
hijackers to stop abusing the marshals and returned to the front 
at which point the beatings resumed both slades testified 
younis 30 has pleaded innocent to a sixcount indictment 
the trial in us district court is a test of a 1984 law in which 
the united states asserts longarm jurisdiction over cases 
involving americans taken hostage overseas slade and his son were 
the only two americans among the approximately 70 passengers and 
crew members 
more than two years after the hijacking on sept 13 1987 
younis was lured to a yacht in international waters off the coast of 
cyprus in the mediterranean sea with the promise of a narcotics deal 
and a party according to evidence presented before the trial 
defense lawyer francis d carter said in his opening argument to 
the jury that younis had given fbi agents a confession while he was 
seasick and suffering without medical attention after the agents 
had broken both his wrists 
a federal appeals court has ruled that the confession may be used 
as evidence but carter told jurors you will have to determine 
whether the statement that my client gave to the fbi was voluntary 
or involuntary 
carter argued that during the hijacking his client was acting 
under orders from amal and that the incident involved a political 
dispute among arabs and was not aimed at the united states 
no passenger received so much of an injury that could be 
covered by a bandaid he said 
the hijackers tried to fly the plane to tunis to read a statement 
complaining about palestinians in lebanon but tunisian authorities 
denied it permission to land and the aircraft returned to beirut 
where the hostages eventually were released 
slade testified that as he and his son were led off the plane 
they saw two hijackers planting explosives 
they were putting hand grenades into the seats said slade 
younis was standing at the foot of the aircraft stairs shaking 
hands with the passengers as they left and headed toward an airport 
bus 
asked why he shook hands with younis william slade said 
i shook his hand because i was afraid that if i had not shaken 
his hand he might have taken offense and done something bad to me 
the prosecution produced as evidence a videotape of the last 
minutes of the hijacking in which younis was standing at the foot 
of the aircraft stairs reading a statement in arabic 
the videotape later showed an explosion at the front of the 
jetliner

the supreme court today reinstated a convicted 
florida murderers death sentence saying he should have been barred 
from mounting a successful constitutional attack in federal courts 
by a 54 vote the court ruled that aubrey adams jr forfeited 
the right to challenge his sentence in federal court on an issue he 
had failed to raise in state appellate courts 
adams was convicted of strangling 8yearold trisa gail thornley 
in ocala 11 years ago 
his conviction and death sentence were upheld three times by the 
florida supreme court before being overturned by a federal appeals 
court 
adams sought federal court review of his case in early 1986 
arguing for the first time that the trial judges instructions 
misled jurors about their role in determining what punishment adams 
should receive 
under florida law a jury recommends life or death for convicted 
murderers in capital cases the presiding judge is free to follow or 
disregard the recommendation 
the judge in adams case told jurors about that aspect of the 
states capitalsentencing law adding the final decision as to 
what punishment shall be imposed rests solely upon the judge of this 
court 
adams argued successfully before the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals that the judges instructions ran afoul of a 1985 supreme 
court decision in which the justices said a death sentence is 
invalid if a jury is misled about its role in determining whether 
the defendant actuall will die 
in the 1985 decision the justices reversed a mississippi 
murderers death sentence because a prosecutor told jurors their 
decision would be reviewed automatically by an appeals court 
writing for the court today justice byron r white said the 11th 
circuit court never should have reached the merits of adams appeal 
white said adams failure to raise the juryinstruction issue in 
his state court appeals precluded him from raising it in a socalled 
habeas corpus appeal in federal court 
the ground for challenging the trial judges instructions 
that they were objectionable under state law was a necessary 
element of the subsequently available claim arising from the 1985 
decision in the mississippi case white said 
his opinion was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
justices harry a blackmun william j brennan thurgood marshall 
and john paul stevens dissented 
the case is dugger vs adams 87121

the supreme court today made it easier for the 
us government to turn over tax information and financial records 
to a foreign government 
the 90 ruling allows canadian officials to see financial records 
of two canadian citizens with bank accounts in washington state 
the supreme court said a federal law aimed at protecting 
potential criminal defendants who also are being investigated by the 
internal revenue service does not apply to tax probes by foreign 
governments 
the canadian department of national revenue that nations 
equivalent of the irs sought records of philip stuart and mons 
kapoor 
both canadian citizens have accounts with the northwestern 
commercial bank in bellingham wash 
the canadian officials said they are investigating the tax 
liability of the two men for 1980 1981 and 1982 
the officials sought the help of the us government under a 1942 
treaty between the two nations the irs issued summonses to the bank 
in 1984 
stuart and kapoor then asked a us federal judge to block the 
summonses the judge declined but the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals ruled in their favor in 1987 
the appeals court said the bank records must be withheld unless 
us officials state that the canadian tax investigation has not 
reached a stage analogous to one in this country in which the irs 
would refer the case to the justice department for criminal 
prosecution 
us government officials said the ruling could hinder us 
treaty obligations and impair the ability of us investigators to 
obtain foreign financial records 
the justice department said tax treaties with 31 foreign 
governments and also exchanges of information under other agreements 
with caribbean basin nations would be affected 
the supreme court today said the federal law barring an irs 
summons when a tax investigation has been referred to the justice 
department does not apply to foreign tax probes 
justice william j brennan writing for the court said the law 
is intended to safeguard rights of the accused by retaining the 
grand jury as a principal tool of criminal prosecution the law also 
is aimed at assuring that criminal defendants will not be forced 
before trial to divulge information to prosecutors in violation of 
their rights 
but brennan said those safeguards are not relevant when the 
investigation takes place in a foreign country 
none of the countries with whom the united states has tax 
treaties providing for exchanges of information employ grand juries 
and canada has ceased to use them brennan said 
also he said the procedures in foreign countries requiring 
targets of investigations to reveal information are considerably 
different than in the united states 
the concerns that prompted congress to pass the law protecting 
suspects rights are therefore not present when the irs issues 
summonses at the request of most foreign governments conducting 
investigations into possible violations of their own tax laws 
brennan said 
so long as the summons meets statutory requirements and is 
issued in good faith compliance is required whether or not the 
canadian tax investigation is directed toward criminal prosecution 
under canadian law he said 
the case is us vs stuart 871064

leftist rebels said today they 
would participate in peace talks with the government but that the 
negotiations must be in san salvador in full view of the people 
they also said the agenda must be broader than the one proposed 
sunday night president jose napoleon duarte 
salvador samayoa a rebel chief now in mexico read the 
guerrillas response during a broadcast on radio ysu in san salvador 
duarte proposed that peace talks begin today in guatemala and 
coincide with a threemonth ceasefire he also proposed that the 
march 19 presidential election be postponed until april 30 
the leader of the rightist party that controls the legislature 
rejected the proposals monday 
the communique by the guerrilla group the farabundo marti 
national liberation front said the talks should be begin march 4 
at the headquarters of the roman catholic archdiocese in san 
salvador 
if both sides agreed to a ceasefire the talks should be held 
among and in full view of the people the communique read by 
samayoa said 
it also said the rebels rejected duartes election date of april 
30 and that his government must state beforehand that it would 
discuss postponing the balloting until september 
the rebels said negotiations must include their demand that the 
governments armed forces be reduced from 56000 men to the 12000 
level of a decade ago before the civil war began another issue 
that must be addressed is prosecution of military officers 
implicated in gross human rights violations they said 
the insurgents gave duarte 48 hours to respond 
on monday ricardo alvarenga a leader of the republican 
nationalist alliance and president of the legislative assembly told 
a news conference that the election date is set and it must be 
fulfilled it is not by altering the constitutional order that 
problems are resolved 
the rightist alliance known as arena controls the unicameral 
assembly and is favored to win the presidency from duartes 
christian democrats it has adamantly rejected any postponement of 
the vote 
washington hailed duartes proposal as presenting the most 
significant opportunity ever for peace in el salvador the united 
states has been backing the government in a 9yearold civil war 
that has claimed more than 70000 lives 
meanwhile the rebels continued their attacks 
the armed forces press office said today that a rebel attack on 
the 6th infantry brigade headquarters in usulutan province 68 miles 
east of the capital wounded three soldiers and a civilian 
in the town of berlin 70 miles east of san salvador in usulutan 
two police officers and four civilians were injured when police 
tried to deactivate an explosive device 
the military also said that three rebels died attacking a 
military position at nueva concepcion 42 miles northeast of the 
capital in chalatenango province rebel radio said 28 soldiers were 
killed or wounded but the military denied the claim 
the rebels said last month that they would participate in the 
election and respect its outcome if the vote were postponed at least 
four months that was seen as a major turnabout by the marxistled 
rebels who have condemned the five previous national elections this 
decade as shams 
duarte suggested sunday that constitutional problems with 
delaying the election could be resolved either through an accord 
involving the three branches of government or by a plebiscite 
he had originally rejected the guerrilla proposal saying 
postponement of the election past march 31 would be unconstitutional 
he did not explain sunday why april 30 could be considered a 
legal date the constitution says elections must be held at least 
two months before the end of the incumbents term 
duartes term expires june 1 the 63yearold president who is 
suffering from terminal liver cancer is expected to survive until 
then 
alvarenga noted that the legislature must analyze duartes 
plebiscite proposal but said he opposed it 
why have a plebiscite the presidential election is a 
plebiscite a consultation of the popular will and it must be 
carried out as scheduled he said

a derailed train that exploded and burned 
jumped the tracks again today while authorities were moving it 
forcing another evacuation just hours after 2000 people were 
allowed back in their homes 
one tanker which carried butane derailed in the center of town 
as officials were moving the train at walking speed to canton 
where the cargo was to be put on undamaged cars csx transportation 
spokesman lloyd lewis said 
the tanker punctured but there was no fire eleven homes and 
three businesses were evacuated officials said the number of 
people evacuated was not immediately known city buses stood by to 
carry evacuees 
the tanker car had 20000 to 25000 gallons of butane but none 
spilled lewis said 
about 2000 people had returned to their homes early today 
ending a twoday evacuation 
a crew from csx transportation which operated the train had 
righted seven tanker cars and were moving them when the second 
derailment occurred 
an eighth car continued to burn but fire chief george romanski 
said it had exhausted most of its fuel and no longer posed a serious 
danger a ninth car was also left at the scene 
the burning car was within yards of a bf goodrich chemical 
plant that houses butadiene a petroleum derivative that can produce 
hazardous smoke if it burns smoke from the burning train posed no 
environmental threat mayor don plusquellic said 
the regional bus system which had been unable to operate monday 
because the bus garage is near the derailed train was back in 
service early today that meant schools which had been closed 
monday could reopen 
homes and businesses within a half mile of the accident were 
evacuated about an hour after the train derailed on the goodrich 
grounds sunday night the train was on a willard ohiotoakron run 
and was not scheduled to stop at goodrich csx officials said 
twentyone cars of the 45car train derailed but only two caught 
fire and one of those was extinguished quickly 
no one was seriously injured more than a dozen people were 
treated at area hospitals many of them complaining of sore throats 
and nausea from the smoke officials said 
most evacuees had found shelter with friends and relatives by 
monday about 350 spent the night at kenmore high school where the 
red cross provided cots blankets food and other needs 
im used to the comforts of home i dont like this at all 
said bill lewis 25 who spent both nights at the high school with 
his wife and three children i didnt think it was going to be an 
allnight affair 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio flew from washington to akron to 
discuss the accident with city officials on monday he said 
railroads should be prohibited from carrying hazardous materials 
through populated areas or near chemical plants 
it just doesnt make good sense metzenbaum said 
gov richard celeste also said national legislation may be needed 
to deal with the problem 
the us district court in columbus ruled last year that 
railroads are not subject to a 1988 state law regulating the 
shipment of hazardous materials

president bush plunged into an uphill campaign 
to salvage his nomination of john tower as defense secretary today 
with a series of private meetings intended to sway senators to vote 
for confirmation 
but the nomination suffered another setback when republican sen 
larry pressler of south dakota announced he was very much leaning 
against confirmation and urged tower to withdraw before a vote 
i think that he may very well be doing him bush a favor in 
this case said pressler who said he was fearful that tower would 
not be capable of cleaning up the pentagon procurement system if 
confirmed 
presslers comments were the most public indication to date that 
republican support for tower and the president might not be firm 
in the senate 
with democrats holding a 5545 majority in the senate 
republicans can illafford any defections from their own ranks if 
bush is to prevail in the first highstakes political showdown of 
his 5weekold presidency 
vice president dan quayle entered the fray telling reporters at 
a hastily called news conference at the entrance to the senate 
subway that the white house is engaged in an all out drive to 
remove obstacles to the confirmation of john tower 
he said he believes tower himself already has removed a serious 
obstacle through his pledge of abstinence 
quayle said he believes that when the vote is taken all 45 
republican senators including pressler will vote for tower 
we are still searching for five democrats and ill make the 
51st vote in favor of john tower said quayle whose role as 
senate president empowers him to cast tiebreaking votes 
well take the votes anyway we can get them he said adding 
that senators should not vote against tower simply because he may 
have stepped on a lot of toes during his service as a direct 
tough competitive chairman of the senate armed services committee 
bush invited several democrats to the white house for a series of 
oneonone meetings today to discuss the nomination 
the first guest senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
did not talk with reporters as he left the white house but said 
later he would announce his own position by days end 
sen james exon dneb said last thursday he expected mitchell 
would oppose the nomination which has failed thus far to attract 
the public support of any democratic senator 
with the full senate prepared to take up the nomination this 
week bush rejoined the battle monday night after returning to the 
capital from the far east he told reporters on air force one i 
havent wavered one iota and i dont intend to 
democrats have been largely unimpressed with towers pledge to 
swear off alcohol if he is confirmed saying they are concerned with 
the issue of his judgment in general and his past links with 
military contractors bush wants to change their minds 
in addition to mitchell bush had individual meetings scheduled 
with sen john warner rva the ranking gop member of the senate 
armed services committee and at least five democrats whose votes 
will be crucial if the former texas senator is to be confirmed they 
are sens charles robb dva lloyd bentsen dtexas bennett 
johnston dla dennis deconcini dariz and bill bradley dnj 
were going to work real hard said white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater were going to talk to a lot of people 
and ask them to keep an open mind and to read the fbi report and to 
talk to john tower 
when bush was asked whether towers nodrinking pledge would 
help he shrugged his shoulders and said i dont know asked if 
towers cause will prvail he replied time will tell i dont 
have any predictions 
following a white house meeting monday night senate republican 
leader bob dole rkan said there was no talk of pulling the plug 
on towers nomination there wasnt any plug mentioned he said 
senators are using the time before formal debate opens on 
wednesday to troop into a guarded capitol hearing room to read a 
confidential fbi report on the former texas senators drinking 
habits alleged womanizing and the extensive and lucrative links 
he forged to military contractors after retiring from the senate 
four years ago 
pressler interviewed today on cbs this morning said ive 
said im leaning very much against him and probably will vote 
against him its based on a strong feeling that john tower is 
very much a part of the problem he comes out of the very group 
that that in my view has made the contractor problem over there 
however sen arlen specter rpa told cbs he leaned toward 
supporting tower adding it is not a supreme court appointment 
tower would serve at the pleasure of the president he could fire 
him at any time if john tower were to drink become inebriated 
under current circumstances it would be known everywhere in the 
world virtually instantaneously 
sen bob graham dfla considered by some a swing vote said on 
nbcs today show the problem was a pattern of bad judgment 
bad judgment including drinking in the 1970s placing himself in a 
compromising position in geneva in the mid1980s and his association 
with the defense industry in the late 1980s 
that pattern raises a question as to whether this man is fit to 
be secretary of defense graham said i spent two hours last 
night studying the fbi files and i have to say the more i know 
about john tower and his background the less i am inclined to 
believe that he should be secretary of defense 
there is something of greater significance than towers 
pledge said sen donald riegle dmich sen tower made 
representations in the armed services committee of not using alcohol 
in certain time periods and that turned out not to be true 
the fact he needed to make that pledge was a doubleedged 
sword said exon of nebraska who said that as recently as two 
weeks ago the white house and tower did not acknowledge tower ever 
had a drinking problem 
yet on sunday in a move to allay fears john made that 
pledge exon said it seems to me it might be interpreted as 
meaning he wants this job too badly 
its like marrying someone who says trust me ill reform 
said sen paul simon dill the experience with people who have 
problems with drink is that these pledges get broken much too 
easily 
but many republicans said towers highvisibility promise before 
a television audience of millions would not be broken 
john towers a man of his word said sen jesse helms rnc 
if he says he wont drink he wont drink 
we have to accept it totally said sen alan simpson rwyo 
he is an honorable man ive never seen john tower break a 
promise 
but would towers pledge change any votes 
it may be it wont affect any said sen trent lott rmiss 
it may be it will affect one it may be that one will be the 
difference 
the democraticcontrolled senate armed services committee voted 
119 along party lines last thursday to recommend the full senate 
reject the nomination

citing threats of violence the school of the art 
institute of chicago has indefinitely closed an exhibit featuring an 
american flag on the floor 
school officials met on monday with representatives of veterans 
groups who requested that the show not reopen unless the flag is 
off the floor but no accord was reached said gene connell one of 
the veterans at the meeting 
felice dublon the schools director of student affairs said 
monday the show will remain closed as long as there are concerns 
about the safety of students 
there were various threats made including threats of physical 
violence to students it was simply a matter of security tony 
jones president the school said through a spokeswoman 
the exhibit was part of a show that displayed works by 66 
minority artists 
last year during an exhibit of student art at the school black 
aldermen stormed in to take down a portrait of the late harold 
washington the citys first black mayor who was depicted in 
lingerie 
dred scott tyler the student artist whose work challenges the 
reverence accorded the us flag said the controversy reinforces 
his claim that the flag means different things to different people 
as tyler appeared outside the school monday to read a statement 
about 60 students shouted first amendment and freedom of 
speech 
tyler wearing dark sunglasses and a black beret said his work 
represents the hope and aspirations of many oppressed minorities 
both here and internationally 
tyler cited the flags worn on cavalry uniforms during the 
suppression of american indians and the flag on the atomic bomb 
dropped on hiroshima 
about 60 veterans many carrying small american flags also 
gathered outside the school to protest the exhibit the veterans 
some of whom had lost limbs labeled the artists work a 
desecration unpatriotic and illegal 
the school of the art institute says it was advised by police 
that the exhibit is legal although trampling or otherwise 
desecrating the flag is a crime 
in the exhibit titled what is the proper way to display the 
american flag the flag lies on the floor beneath a montage that 
includes photographs of flagdraped coffins and a picture of south 
koreans burning the us flag 
visitors are invited to comment in a ledger on a shelf the 
veterans complain that most people will step on the flag to do so 
asked about the outcry from veterans tyler said i feel 
basically theyre trying to enforce patriotism in this country 
i think that is outrageous 
amvets state coordinator robert heppinger disagreed 
all we ask is a little respect for our banner that led us in 
the war to maintain the freedoms that these people are taking 
advantage of heppinger said the flag should be respected at 
all times

a priest who offered 100 for every handgun turned 
in at his church has been stung by a political gadfly who exchanged 
a cheap pistol to help pay for an assault rifle 
the rev marshall gourley said 14 guns had been surrendered at 
our lady of guadalupe catholic church as of late monday in response 
to the offer announced during mass on sunday 
robin heid a 35yearold private investigator and freelance 
writer exchanged a 5yearold gun then went before a waiting tv 
crew to say he would use the 100 as a down payment on an ar15 the 
civilian version of an m16 assault rifle 
this is a capitalist country when you have a chance to make a 
good deal you make it heid said 
he said the 22caliber revolver he exchanged was worth no more 
than 40 
the priest who presided over the funerals of two gunshot victims 
in the past month called the move a betrayal of his effort to 
remove as many guns as possible from the streets of denver im 
disappointed in him he said 
the bounty came from a 2000 donation from a parishioner who 
requested that the cash be used for something worthwhile other than 
church repairs or the annual budget gourley said

school boards often are rubber stamps for 
district superintendents instead of reflecting the communities they 
are supposed to represent concludes a firsttime survey of board 
presidents released tuesday 
the findings based on questionnaires completed by 1217 school 
board presidents show large gaps between the board presidents and 
the public on issues ranging from school ratings and problems to sex 
education and parental choice 
fully 81 percent of the board presidents said they were greatly 
influenced by their superintendent compared to 4 percent who 
reported being greatly influenced by the pta and 3 percent by 
individual parents the longer they are board members the more 
resistant they are to change the survey found 
the study shows that people come in energetic and interested in 
reform but very quickly they are discouraged or its just easier 
to go along with the ride said emily feistritzer an education 
analyst and director of the private national center for education 
information 
the widest opinion gap came in the area of public school choice 
a concept championed by president bush and supported by 71 percent 
of the public in a 1987 gallup poll but only 36 percent of the 
school board presidents said parents should have the right to select 
which local school their child attends 51 percent were opposed 
other areas of difference with the public 
a 1988 gallup poll found the public considered drug use and lack 
of discipline the two most serious problems faced by schools school 
board presidents overwhelmingly cited lack of proper financial 
support as their schools biggest problem 
eighty percent of the school board presidents favored sex 
education in grades 48 but only 55 percent of the public felt that 
way in a spring 1987 gallup poll 
forty percent of the public graded their local schools a or b in 
a gallup poll last year a full 79 percent of school board 
presidents gave their own schools an a or b even while agreeing 
with the public that nationally schools arent doing too well 
the board presidents did reflect prevailing public views in their 
strong support for paying teachers on the basis of performance and 
requiring them to pass competency tests before they can teach 
asked what would improve education 84 percent said requiring 
students to perform at grade level to attain promotions the next 
most popular suggestion winning 75 percent was recruiting teachers 
from other career fields 
twothirds of the board presidents also favored giving individual 
schools greater flexibility in determining what and how students are 
taught and in deciding how the school will operate only onethird 
however said teachers should have greater authority in running 
schools 
the survey found that 97 percent of school board presidents are 
white 71 percent are male and 68 percent have never worked in an 
education system nearly half are in their 40s 94 percent are 
married and almost twothirds have children at home the presidents 
are better educated make more money and are more conservative 
politically than the average american 
there are 40 million students enrolled in public schools in more 
than 15000 school districts across the country responses to the 
feistritzer survey were weighted to reflect all districts and the 
results had a margin of error of 3 percentage points

a new york newspaper office and two california bookstores were 
firebombed early today in attacks possibly related to moslem anger 
over the novel the satanic verses officials said 
i cant imagine any other reason why people would be lobbing 
bombs through bookstores said bookstore owner andy ross as he 
helped clean up the damage at his codys books in berkeley calif 
both codys a berkeley landmark near the university of 
california campus and a branch of the waldenbooks chain a block 
away were damaged when bottles filled with a flammable liquid were 
tossed through windows their owners said 
the blaze at the riverdale press in the bronx section of new york 
city heavily damaged the building authorities said no one was 
inside at the time 
witnesses said a station wagon drove by the offices about 440 
am and someone in the car tossed an incendiary device through a 
window police said the firebombing may have been in retaliation 
for an editorial the weekly paper ran last week supporting the right 
to read salman rushdies novel said firefighter tom mctigue 
the novel has sparked violent protests among moslems who consider 
it blasphemous irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini ordered a death 
sentence for rushdie and his publisher 
my guess is that it had something to do with something that was 
printed in the paper riverdale press copublisher richard stein 
said but i dont know what 
mctigue and stein stressed that no motive had been established 
and that there was no definite link to the satanic verses 
i honestly feel it is nothing but speculation stein said 
we have not received any telephone or written threats no one has 
taken credit for this 
stein said the 39yearold community newspaper which has a paid 
circulation of 14000 would print its wednesday edition despite the 
damage 
he said the paper which was a pulitzer prize finalist last year 
for the second time is known for its activism and outspoken 
editorial page but he said he could not recall anything recently 
that could be considered of incendiary import 
in an editorial last week the newspaper criticized bookstores 
that removed the satanic verses from display he said 
i cannot imagine why our paper would be singled out among the 
thousands of newspapers around the country that published similar 
thoughts he said 
in berkeley waldenbooks manager bob gammon wasnt ready to blame 
the firebombing on the furor over rushdies book 
weve had no threats no one claiming to have done it gammon 
said so theres no evidence that it was due to satanic verses 
 
gammon and ross said they had been told by police that the fires 
resulted from a kerosenetype firebomb police would not confirm the 
report but said arson investigators were sent 
we had a broken window and a carpet caught fire gammon said 
ross estimated damage at less than 1000 ross had put out a 
flyer wednesday denouncing the intellectual terrorism that is 
being directed against mr rushdie 
both men said their stores had sold all copies of the novel 
waldenbooks one of the nations largest bookstore chains pulled 
the book off shelves for a week before announcing friday that 
managers could display it at their discretion

more than onethird of chinas city residents saw 
their real incomes decline in 1988 a year of impressive economic 
growth tempered by disturbingly high inflation and serious supply 
shortages 
the state statistics bureau in an annual report announced 
tuesday said per capita income in urban areas was 302 up only 12 
percent from 1987 after deducting price increases 
it said the spending power of 349 percent of urban families 
declined because their incomes failed to keep pace with inflation 
in 1987 20 percent of urban residents reported declines in their 
living standards 
among the hardest hit were government employees on fixed salaries 
and construction workers affected by policies intended to slow down 
the overheated economy bureau spokesman zhang zhongji said at a 
news conference 
in rural areas where more than threefourths of chinas 11 
billion people live per capita income rose 63 percent after 
inflation to 147 
it was a year of joy and worry with many difficulties zhang 
said 
the main worry was the highest rate of inflation in communist 
chinas history retail prices in december were up 267 percent over 
the same month in 1987 the bureau said the prices of meat poultry 
and eggs fresh vegetables and aquatic products were all up by more 
than 30 percent 
among basic materials the general price index for rolled steel 
was up 21 percent copper was up 50 percent and aluminum was up 386 
percent 
zhang said the gross national product rose 112 percent to 374 
billion and national income totaled 312 billion an increase of 
114 percent 
but growth he said was uneven and the gap widened between 
social supply and social demand 
industrial output value shot up 207 percent to 489 billion 
among consumer goods production of color tv sets rose by 528 
percent refrigerators by 844 percent and motor vehicles by 371 
percent 
industries such as coal and steel however showed relatively 
slow growth and 20 percent of enterprises cant operate at full 
strength because of power shortages 
agricultural output value grew only by 32 percent and grain 
production the crucial measure of the nations agricultural health 
declined by 9 million tons to 394 million tons 
zhang said grain output fell about 22 million tons short of need 
and that 40 million people in rural areas are short of food about 
11 million tons was taken from reserves and another 11 million tons 
imported he said 
zhang also said that 14400 investment projects had been 
suspended or cancelled since the government embarked last fall on a 
tough austerity program to cool down economic growth and bring 
inflation under control 
he said that represented about 10 percent of all ongoing projects 
zhang could not give a figure for how many jobs had been lost in 
the building clampdown but estimated that unemployment will rise 
from the current 21 percent of urban workers to about 3 percent by 
the end of 1989 he said there are now 1357 million urban workers 
up 36 million from the end of 1987 
zhang said the austerity program has shown results with the 
retail price index going up only 1 percent in january compared to 
december 
but despite the clampdown on projects in the last quarter of the 
year overall spending in projects under construction rose 12 
percent over the year to 351 billion 
this was mainly because too many unimportant projects were 
started and investments outside the budget increased greatly 
zhang said the problems china faces are more complicated and 
difficult than in 1984 and 1985 when there was a similar 
situation of too rapid growth 
china is saddled with stagnation in grain production four years 
ago it was coming off bumper harvests 
another difference he said is that the government has less 
control over the economy because it has relinquished some authority 
under marketoriented reforms the reforms have also allowed 
enterprises to keep more of their profits and price rises have not 
translated into increased revenues for the state

rioters clashed with national guard 
troops and thieves looted stores in the capital today a day after 
the worst street violence in venezuela in 30 years police estimated 
25 people were killed in caracas alone and more than 1000 arrested 
the violence triggered by bus fare increases began monday and 
spread to at least seven cities and towns it continued for a second 
day today in caracas where sirens wailed as authorities put out 
fires and battled looters in streets filled with shattered glass 
independent reports estimated damage nationwide to be in the 
millions of dollars on some caracas streets virtually every store 
was looted the rioting eased in the early morning hours then 
resumed later in the day as troops moved against thieves carrying 
appliances and furniture from stores 
it is a popular uprising there are riots everywhere they are 
all furious said metropolitan police inspector jose lara 
montilla who commanded a unit armed with shotguns 
all police forces are in a state of emergency i cannot give 
you exact figures but around 25 people have died and no one knows 
how many injured another police official said this morning 
hospitals can no longer cope people just keep coming and 
coming said the police official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the figures were for caracas and outlying areas he said adding 
that information from other parts of the country was not available 
immediately 
army trucks full of troops patrolled some streets in caracas this 
morning while blocks away looters continued to remove goods from 
stores were waiting for orders said a national guardsman 
when asked why they were taking little action 
perhaps the worst violence occurred monday in guarenas a 
shantytown about 12 miles from the capital where the disturbances 
began people there formed human chains and threw rocks at national 
guard troops in armored cars after the soldiers began firing 
birdshot and tear gas at looters 
a 32yearold pregnant woman who was not involved in the rioting 
was shot to death and at least 126 people were wounded said 
journalist igor camacho of the voz de guarenas newspaper 
rioters in the shantytown emptied dozens of stores and 
supermarkets and set at least 14 vehicles ablaze 
officially bus fares were to rise only about 30 percent on 
urban routes for example from the equivalent of about a nickel to 
7 cents 
but transportation minister gustavo rada said today some 
increases have been as high as 50 percent apparently because of 
price gouging by bus drivers 
the increases are part of an economic reform package announced 
last week by the government of president carlos andres perez 
weak oil prices have seriously hurt the economy of venezuela 
which for decades has been one of south americas most stable 
democracies more than 40 percent of venezuelans live in poverty 
perez appealed for calm and said the rioting was 
unjustifiable however opposition leaders called for continued 
protests against the governments economic program 
a woman caught in the crossfire monday as she tried to get home 
complained the looters were criminals taking advantage of what 
started out as a protest 
theyre just criminals robbing burning ive never seen 
anything this bad she said crying 
fires in poor neighborhoods in the hills on the outskirts of the 
city burned through the evening 
residents in san agustin del sur took over the francisco fajardo 
highway the citys main artery on monday they fought a battle 
with police that began with rocks and tear gas and ended with 
gunfire from both sides 
drivers panicked and abandoned their cars on the highway public 
transportation was brought to a standstill 
alex martinez a deputy police commissioner said monday that all 
6000 officers on the caracas police force were called out and that 
at least 100000 people were stranded at work the citys population 
is nearly 4 million 
three guardsmen were hurt by rocks thrown by students in merida 
more than 300 miles southwest of caracas 
its an outright battle between students and the national 
guard said ramon suarez a reporter for the newspaper frontera in 
merida home to the 10000 students of the university of the andes 
tanks patrolled the streets 
students took the state governor orlando guttierez prisoner for 
about an hour monday when he tried to talk to the rioters 
two weeks after perez was inaugurated feb 2 he announced his 
economic austerity package which includes food and gas price 
increases 
the countrys 33 billion foreign debt is the fourthlargest in 
latin america later this week venezuela is to sign a 15 billion 
credit with the international monetary fund 
the last nationwide riots occurred in 1958 when dictator marcos 
perez jimenez was ousted

oliver norths irancontra trial came to a halt 
again today after it was discovered that governmentcensored memos 
by norths contra courier robert owen had already been made public 
norths lawyers immediately moved to dismiss the indictment 
against north saying it was impossible for the former white house 
aide to get a fair trial under federal secrecy procedures 
us district judge gerhard a gesell sent the jurors home 
saying there were unresolved problems concerning the classified 
material he scheduled an afternoon hearing on the matter 
we are dealing with problems inherent in the nature in this 
trial what is classified and what isnt classified said north 
lawyer brendan sullivan he said the matter was so extraordinary 
and so important it affects the ongoing nature of the trial 
the dispute was triggered by a memo by owen which stated the 
name of a high costa rican official former security minister 
benjamin piza owens memo containing pizas name had already been 
turned over in a lawsuit to the christic institute an activist 
group that has been critical of us policy in central america 
however when the same document was introduced at norths trial 
pizas name had been excised by us intelligence officials on 
national security grounds 
the disclosure that the name had been turned over to the 
institute last summer caused gesell to call for the hearing 
we have reached a point where i have to take some testimony 
relating to legal matters he told the jury i did not realize 
this situation confronted me until i arrived at 7 oclock this 
morning 
owen was norths courier to the contra rebels in nicaragua and 
was being crossexamined by sullivan owen was to appear at this 
afternoons hearing 
norths lawyers filed a motion asking that the indictment against 
north be dismissed on the ground of misconduct by the 
prosecution 
they alleged in the motion that the office of independent counsel 
lawrence walsh had known for at least 10 days that all but one of 19 
memos by owen to north introduced in the case had previously been 
turned over to the christic institute 
instead of disclosing this critical fact the ic independent 
counsel hid it and incredibly insisted that the court and the 
defense treat these alreadypublic documents as classified the 
motion said 
sullivan complained that the defense has spent days trying to 
devise means of tiptoeing around information that the ic knew 
all along had already been released to the public 
this misconduct mandates dismissal of the indictment his 
motion said 
ten of the owen memos were censored because of perceived danger 
to national security 
sullivans motion outlined the circumstances under which the 
defense learned after 10 pm tuesday from owens lawyer that the 
uncensored versions of the owen memos had been given to the christic 
institute in the suit 
sullivan asked for the hearing to find out exactly when 
prosecutors knew about this what efforts they made to prevent the 
institute from disclosing them and why the fact of public 
disclosure was withheld from the defense and the court while these 
matters were being hotly litigated 
the defense lawyer said the dispute demonstrates why the law 
dealing with national secrets is unworkable and unconstitutional 
in the north case 
the government is simply unable to manage the classified 
information at issue here in a manner that permits a fair trial 
said the defense motion it asked that gesell consider an earlier 
request by the defense that the classified information procedures 
act be declared unconstitutional 
in court the head of the prosecution team john keker said 
there was knowledge within the independent counsels office 
about the christic institute and the owen memos but keker denied 
trying to mislead the court saying we certainly didnt make a 
representation yesterday that we knew werent correct 
sullivan said it is appalling to me what is happening i 
believe there is a fraud on the defense 
north a retired marine lieutenant colonel and a former national 
security council aide faces 12 felony charges including 
allegations he lied to lawmakers to cover up his secret efforts to 
help the contras when such assistance was banned by congress 
gesell is assigning code names to mask the identities of foreign 
officials and intelligence operatives the government wants kept 
secret 
a cia headquarters official with whom owen met in costa rica was 
assigned the codename cia one during mondays proceedings

immigration officials overnight seized 69 
illegal aliens about to board the same crosscountry flight on which 
79 undocumented immigrants were taken into custoday the night 
before authorities said 
the 69 were trying to board an eastern airlines flight to new 
york by way of atlanta said immigration and naturalization service 
spokesman joe flanders 
he said 54 were from mexico seven from el salvador four from 
colombia and four from guatemala most will be allowed to go home or 
request a deportation hearing he said 
flanders said one man was arrested and may have been the 
principal smuggler 
on monday authorities seized 79 illegal aliens during flight 
80s 535 am stopover in atlanta acting on tips from airline 
sources and someone who often traveled the route and became 
suspicious of fellow passengers 
investigators believe illegal aliens have been aboard the eastern 
overnight flight nearly every day for the past 30 days said tom 
thomas an ins spokesman in atlanta 
thomas said the flight might have been used because no plane 
tranfers are involved and rates might have been cheaper 
theres a commuter who regularly flies from los angeles to 
atlanta who called our office and said hey it seems theres 
an awful lot of hispanic people who fly this flight you might want 
to check into it thomas said 
thomas said some of the aliens indicated they had paid up to 
4000 for a package but authorities dont know what that deal 
included other than air fare from california to new york the 
package could have included living arrangements phony documents and 
a job he added 
on monday the cheapest fares available for the flight were 433 
to 577 including taxes according to a travel agent 
one of the 79 elias quevedogonzalez of pachalun guatemala 
said he borrowed 1400 from neighbors to make the trip so he could 
earn money in the united states to send back to his wife and seven 
children 
about four people in my town have done that and when they came 
back i could see their families were much better off the 
39yearold man said they had better clothes and good food 
thomas said eastern has cooperated fully in the investigation 
we dont in any way connect eastern and dont want to intimate 
that they were even remotely involved at this point he said 
in miami eastern spokeswoman virginia sanchez said all i know 
is that the ins had told us theyd be monitoring a flight this week 
and of course we cooperated with them 
in addition to guatemala the aliens taken off mondays flight 
came from mexico the dominican republic el salvador honduras and 
ecuador thomas said he said they would be transferred to ins 
processing facilities in florida and texas for deportation 
but one of the aliens juan de la cruzrodriguez 34 said he 
would do whatever he could to stay in this country because if i go 
back theyll put me in prison theyll kill me if i dont pay what 
i owe 
de la cruzrodriguez who said he was trying to make money to 
send to his wife and three young sons in the dominican republic 
said a smuggler in mexico helped him and about a dozen others cross 
the border then arranged to have them transported by flatbed truck 
to los angeles 
i always had the image of america having a lot of money and a 
lot of wealth and that i could find work without any problem he 
said 
he said he sold his truck to raise part of the money and gave the 
smuggler almost 1000 holding up a quarter he said thats all 
i have left

interior secretary manual lujan jr said 
tuesday he intends to reverse his predecessors plan to lower 
royalties on coal taken from mines beneath federal lands 
lujan testifying before the interior subcommittee of the house 
appropriations committee also said he would try to get congress to 
raise sharply the 250 per acre fee charged for converting oil 
shale and other mining claims into outright ownership 
but lujan said he found he could not stop a change in the method 
of valuing coal that lowers royalties and it might be nov 1 before 
he could promulgate a new regulation to revoke it 
former secretary donald p hodel had approved proposals to lower 
the royalty on underground coal from 8 percent to 5 percent and to 
exlude state and federal taxes from the value of coal when 
calculating royalties 
while the rate change has not become final lujan said the 
valuation method change takes effect wednesday he said the 
departments lawyers have told him he could not stop that change 
although he intends to try 
lujan said he would begin a study immediately of the change in 
valuation methods and if production and royalty payments increase 
the aim of the change in the first place then of course we 
dont want to rescind the rule 
conceding final defeat in a lawsuit begun in 1920 that the 
government had lost twice in the supreme court hodel issued deeds 
of ownership at 250 an acre to 82000 acres of shale land in 
colorado that the new owners promptly sold at a large profit 
the department resolved to start processing other shale 
applications while it decides on rules for determining the validity 
of the claims a decision that brought much protest in congress 
protest that lujan clearly agreed with 
there are 11 applications and 1592 claims to 241000 acres of 
shale land in colorado utah and wyoming 
i cant tell you im going to deny these groups of claimants 
their rights lujan told the subcommittee i can tell you im 
going to develop red tape or whatever the government does so well 
in a process by which we determine if theyre valid and that is 
going to take at least a year 
during that year he said he would work with congress to raise 
the fee he said department lawyers had told him his idea that the 
fee be pegged to the value of the land could not stand legal 
scrutiny 
he did not mention a specific figure for a new fee except to say 
it should be much higher than 250 an acre a fee that has remained 
unchanged since 1872 
proposed rules for deciding on the validity of claims were sent 
to the office of management and budget in december and department 
spokesman tim locke said lujan had written omb asking that the draft 
be returned so he can put it under his own microscope 
half of all federal royalties are returned to state governments 
with just about all going to wyoming montana colorado utah new 
mexico and north dakota lujan said the states had protested both 
planned changes 
the western organization of resource councils estimated that 
wyoming would lose 11 million a year from the change in valuation 
methods colorado would lose 13 million montana 47 million new 
mexico 650000 north dakota 462000 and utah 710000 
the loss to the federal government would be roughly the same 
188 million a year 
in all the federal government received 153 million in coal 
royalties in fiscal 1987 the last year for which figures are 
complete and an estimated 246 million in 1988 according to 
preliminary estimates 
the reduction in royalty rate from 8 percent to 5 percent for 
underground mines would cost the government 182 million to 202 
million a year if production did not change the department has 
estimated

here at a glance are highlights of actions 
taken tuesday by the supreme court 
 
city liability 
 
local governments may be forced to pay monetary damages to people 
whose rights are violated by inadequately trained public employees 
the supreme court ruled unanimously today 
ruling in a case from canton ohio the justices said cities and 
towns may be held legally accountable if the inadequate training 
stemmed from governmental deliberate indifference 
in an opinion by justice byron r white the court said the 
inadequate training also must be closely related to the ultimate 
injury suffered before local governments can be forced to pay 
damages 
white said the court was imposing a stringent standard for those 
filing such suits because any lesser standard would open local 
governments to unprecedented liability and saddle federal courts 
with an endless exercise of secondguessing municipal 
employeetraining programs 
the case is canton vs harris 861088 
 
strikers 
 
the court said railroads and airlines may penalize strikers by 
giving their jobs to employees with less seniority who stay on the 
job or return to work before the strike ends 
in a 63 ruling which was a victory for trans world airlines 
justice sandra day oconnor said that such a policy of encouraging 
prestrike workers to remain on the job during the strike or to 
abandon the strike and return to work before all vacancies were 
filled is a legitimate exercise of twas peaceful economic 
power 
the case is twa vs flight attendants 87548 
 
tax information 
 
the court made it easier for the us government to turn over tax 
information to a foreign government 
the 90 ruling allows canadian officials to see financial records 
of two canadian citizens with bank accounts in washington state 
the case is us vs stuart 871064 
 
death sentence 
 
the court reinstated a convicted florida murderers death 
sentence saying he should have been barred from mounting a 
successful constitutional attack in federal courts 
by a 54 vote the court ruled that aubrey adams jr forfeited 
his right to challenge his sentence in federal court on grounds he 
failed to raise in state court 
adams was convicted of strangling an 8yearold girl in ocala 11 
years ago 
the case is dugger vs adams 87121

at least three universities are ready for george 
bush to become a former president 
rice university texas aampm university and bushs alma mater yale 
university already have expressed interest in becoming the site of 
his presidential library 
in a typical case funds for construction of a presidential 
library are raised from private sources and an institution such as 
a university provides a site 
rice is certainly interested in the presidential papers and we 
have initiated conversations with the bush administration on the 
matter rice president george rupp said in a statement we are 
continuing to work on the opportunity but no one has made a 
commitment 
rice partisans note that secretary of state james baker a native 
houstonian and a close friend of bushs has begun depositing his 
papers at rices fondren library 
they also note that in 1978 bush was an adjunct professor of 
administrative science at rice teaching a graduatelevel course in 
organization theory based on his experience as an oilman member 
of congress chairman of the republican national committee director 
of the cia and us envoy to china 
bryan jones head of texas aampms political science department 
and a colleague presidential scholar george edwards drafted a 
memorandum urging the university to explore the possibilities of 
gaining the presidential library 
newsweek magazine quoted bush as saying he has already decided 
his presidential papers should go to a texas university that has 
not deterred yale 
im sure yale will be making an effort to persuade the 
president to locate his library here or at least some place near 
here said jack siggins an administrator of yales library 
i believe that possibility has been mentioned to president bush 
in fact before he was president bush by yales president benno

mayor eugene sawyer lacking the monolithic 
support among fellow blacks that twice put harold washington in city 
hall bet his future on blacks voting in todays mayoral primary 
against frontrunner richard m daley 
we must win this race sawyer told a crowd of blacks monday 
night at his last campaign stop a south side church with jesse 
jackson 
ive got to do it for harold 
daley son of the quintessential political boss who ruled chicago 
for more than two decades remained confident in his quest for the 
democratic nomination even though the most recent poll showed his 
lead reduced from 10 points to 7 
from every community daley told a polishamerican womens 
group you see some of the wealthiest people and some of the 
poorest people you see them all reaching out to you 
light snow fell as the polls opened at 6 am but skies cleared 
by midmorning project leap a watchdog group said its observer 
reported as many as 25 late openings among the 1600 to 1700 
polling places more than in the previous seven elections 
sawyer and daley the cook county prosecutor are the top 
candidates in a fourway race the winner advances to the april 4 
general election which was forced by the death 15 months ago of 
washington chicagos first black mayor 
polls have indicated that sawyer would get most of the black vote 
and daley most of the white and hispanic vote 
i think the mayors message has gotten through said sawyers 
campaign spokesman larry horist the black community has pretty 
much decided its not right to abstain from voting and they will 
turn out 
blacks and whites each comprise about 40 percent of the citys 
population and hispanics nearly 20 percent 
the nominee will face the winner of the republican primary 
whites herbert sohn or writein candidate edward vrdolyak and 
thirdparty candidate timothy evans who is black in april 
the winner of the general election will serve the final two years 
of washingtons fouryear term 
the chicago board of election commissioners predicted 68 percent 
of the citys 155 million voters would vote today but thomas 
leach board spokesman lowered that projection to 64 percent based 
on early voting 
elsewhere today three challengers in st petersburg fla are 
trying to unseat mayor robert ulrich in a nonpartisan primary and 
in wichita kan where residents approved a change in the structure 
of city government last november 16 candidates are vying in the 
first mayoral election since 1916 
the chicago campaign has been mostly devoid of the racial 
polarization that marred many previous campaigns yet sawyer knows 
he must get some support from evans backers in order to block daley 
and keep the seat he won during a raucous city council meeting in 
december 1987 one week after washingtons death 
sawyer has received an enormous lift from jackson a chicagoan 
and 1988 democratic presidential candidate who has walked downtown 
streets preached from church pulpits and shaken the hands of 
commuters all with the aim of generating enthusiasm for the acting 
mayor 
during monday nights rally jackson recalled the long struggle 
for black voting rights 
we died too young bled too profusely and lost too many martyrs 
to not vote jackson said we stand tonight on the tombstone of 
the martyrs who paid not with the dollar but their lives for the 
right to vote 
some people however were less than enthused with the choices 
nobodys really said anything about what they can do for the 
city said theresa hood 22 a likely sawyer voter who said 
divisions in the black community since washingtons death have left 
her disillusioned 
it seems like when he died we all forgot what he stood for 
among republicans who havent had a mayor since william hale 
big bill thompson ran city hall and scarface al capone ruled 
the streets the wild card was vrdolyak and his bid to win the gop 
primary through writeins 
but sohn a doctor and the partys endorsed candidate insisted 
he would beat vrdolyak former alderman and exchairman of the local 
democratic party 
vrdolyaks entrance into the race was seen by some as a threat to 
daley 
what we dont know is the effect of vrdolyaks personal 
campaigning in the last few days said william aukstik a daley 
worker who was promoting his candidate in vrdolyaks home ward

the lifetime cost of treating aids patients 
diagnosed with the disease in the fiveyear period beginning in 1988 
is estimated at 243 billion according to a study released tuesday 
the report said that the lifetime treatment cost for a patient 
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome is about 60000 a figure 
that may change as treatment improves 
the report gives these estimates for the numbers of aids patients 
diagnosed in the indicated year and total lifetime medical cost of 
those patients 
1988 39000 aids new cases total lifetime medical treatment 
26 billion 
1989 54000 cases 35 billion 
1990 71000 cases 47 billion 
1991 91000 cases 60 billion 
1992 114000 cases 75 billion 
fred j hellinger an economist at the national center for health 
services research and health care technology assessment and who 
compiled the study said the estimated 60000 lifetime medical cost 
per patient is lower than some earlier estimates because aids 
patients now are spending less time in hospitals and receiving more 
care as outpatients 
hellinger said that research by three insurance organizations 
estimated that about 50000 will be paid by health insurers for 
each aids patient for the study he added 5000 for expenses not 
covered by the insurance companies and another 5000 for the cost 
of azt an antiviral drug approved by the food and drug 
administration in 1987 
the costs of treating an aids victim may fall because treatment 
throughout the nation becomes more effective hellinger said 
but it is also possible that treatment costs may continue to vary 
dramatically across sites and that the approval of new drugs to 
treat aids patients will increase longevity and thereby offset any 
savings realized through more effective treatment 
the studys projections of the numbers of new aids cases is based 
on the 72 percent increase in diagnosed cases during the last two 
months of 1987 and the first six months of 1988 hellinger said the 
study assumed that this trend would continue indefinitely 
hellingers study appeared in inquiry a journal published 
quarterly by the blue cross and blue shield association in chicago

an anonymous caller who said he belonged to a 
group that claims to hold a missing israeli paratrooper threatened 
on tuesday to kill the soldier unless israel releases 1500 
palestinian prisoners 
the anonymous caller told israel radio his group would release a 
cassette to prove they were holding the soldier avi sassportas 
according to radio reporter elihu benon 
he said we are the organization that is holding the soldier 
and we want you to release 1500 prisoners if not the soldier will 
die benon told the associated press 
he said the caller who spoke hebrew with an arab accent read 
from a prepared statement and refused to answer questions he hung 
up after about 15 seconds and did not name the group he claimed to 
represent 
on monday a similar call to the agence france presse news agency 
said a group called the palestinian arab army was holding 
sassportas who disappeared 13 days ago the caller said the group 
was not linked to the plo 
the palestinian arab army was not publicly known before mondays 
call west bank commander amram mitzna told the haaretz daily it has 
been operating since the start of the palestinian uprising but 
later said on radio nothing was known of the group 
on israel radio mitzna said the army was treating tuesdays call 
seriously but did not plan to comply with the demand to release 
prisoners 
the caller did not say which prisoners should be freed army 
figures indicate as many as 9000 palestinians have been jailed in 
connection with the uprising 
sassportas was last seen feb 16 near ashkelon after leaving his 
base in southern israel to hitch a ride home to ashod he was 
wearing his uniform and armed with an m16 assault rifle the area 
is close to the gaza strip 
thousands of people have participated in searches since then 
proof that he was kidnapped by a palestinian group could 
undermine a current shift in public opinion toward negotiations with 
the plo 
army officials said monday the democratic front for the 
liberation of palestine a radical marxist plo faction had claimed 
it abducted sassportas 
israeli warplanes on tuesday bombed and rocketed a base in

a february halfprice sale on fines has 
cleared driving records and perhaps consciences for many 
motorists a judge said tuesday 
traffic judge bill watt estimated that payments increased by a 
third during the monthlong drive to reduce a backlog of more than 
5000 traffic warrants and 3500 parking tickets 
little rock municipal traffic court told violators that they had 
until tuesday to clear their fines for half the amount owed the 
offer covered fines dating from 1986 to january 1989 watt said 
many of the warrants included a charge of failure to appear in 
court which adds 100 to the original penalty 
the cut rate is not costing the city money because many of the 
warrants would be uncollectible without the expense of sending 
officers out to contact the violators watt said 
if we get 1 in revenue off a warrant from someone voluntarily 
surrendering themselves we are not losing 2 which we might not 
get anyway we are gaining 1 he said

overriding opposition from gun owners and the 
city attorney the city council approved a ban on possession and 
sale of assault weapons like those used in a stockton schoolyard 
shooting last month 
the ordinance was approved 72 monday 
council members also empowered police to impound for up to three 
days semiautomatic assault weapons found during patrols the 
ordinance would allow police to determine whether the guns are 
stolen or can be linked to a crime 
police previously could confiscate a gun only during an arrest 
several proposals to ban or restrict assault weapons have been 
introduced in the legislature since last months schoolyard attack 
in which patrick purdy killed five children and wounded 30 people 
with an ak47 rifle before killing himself 
los angeles stockton and compton and santa clara county have 
also passed bans on assault weapons but national rifle association 
members last week asked the state supreme court to overturn the los 
angeles and stockton ordinances 
san diego city attorney john witt argued that his citys 
ordinance would probably be struck down because the state has sole 
authority to legislate firearms 
councilman wes pratt however said the city needs to take such 
weapons out of criminals hands 
now is the time to act and this is a reasonable approach he 
said 
semiautomatic assault weapons fire one round with each squeeze of 
the trigger until the ammunition clip is expended

a movement is under way to preserve the 
home of a black writer whose violent death went unpunished because 
of precivil war legal discrimination 
william johnson a successful barber businessman and diarist is 
considered by historians the most prominent free black man in 
antebellum mississippi 
freed from slavery by his white owner in louisiana johnson built 
a threestory brick home in this blufflined mississippi river town 
in the early 1840s it remained in his family until purchased in 
1976 by a garden club 
what many people do not realize is that natchez had almost half 
of the states entire free black population before the war said 
mimi miller a historic preservation consultant what made johnson 
so important was that he kept a diary that represents the most 
complete and accurate account of a free black man during this period 
of our history 
miller who has worked with the natchez garden club to preserve 
the home said that through johnsons writings historians were 
able to learn that just as in the white society different levels 
of social class existed within the free black society this society 
was separate and distinct from blacks who were slaves 
the diary and other information indicates johnson was accepted 
and respected by the community and when he died in 1851 he 
received a very large obituary but the great and tragic thing is his 
death went unpunished because he was black miller said 
johnson apparently was shot by a man named baylor winn after a 
long dispute over land boundaries 
only blacks witnessed the shooting and under mississippi law at 
the time a black man could not testify against a white man miller 
said winn represented himself as white but prosecutors in hopes of 
allowing the testimony of black witnesses argued he had some black 
ancestry 
natchez was so outraged they had to move his trial to another 
town so winn could get an impartial jury she said the johnson 
family hired an attorney will t martin who later became one of 
mississippis highest ranking confederate generals 
despite martins efforts winn went free 
johnsons house proved to be a historical treasure trove 
containing much more than the 16year diary which was published by 
the louisiana state university press in 1951 
in the attic were nearly 1400 legal and financial documents 
personal and business correspondence volumes of account books and 
old newspapers and sheet music dating from 1793 said margaret moss 
of the natchez garden club 
miller said preservationists hope to use the homes ground floor 
for an exhibit on natchezs black history and restore the living 
quarters upstairs with period furnishings 
in 1987 the legislature authorized the states archives and 
history department to buy restore and administer the home once 
sufficient funds are secured said director elbert hilliard the 
effort will require a 15 million endowment hilliard said 
an advisory committee has been formed to study ways to raise 
money from private sources meanwhile the national trust for 
historic preservation and the jack daniel foundation for preserving 
american landmarks and traditions is working on raising 4000 to 
make immediate repairs

the cargo door that ripped off a boeing 747 over 
the pacific had electrical problems in recent months and a seal on 
the door was repaired in january an investigator said 
for the pilot who safely landed the damaged jetliner capt david 
m cronin the flight was to be his nexttolast before retiring 
and now we will have another reason to celebrate said his 
daughter kelly hart of hawaii 
after nine people were sucked out of the jumbo jet to their 
deaths the 59yearold united airlines pilot managed to turn the 
plane around and land safely in honolulu on only two of the four 
engines 
her father gives all the credit to the heavenly father watching 
over him another daughter karen twiggsmith told the honolulu 
advertiser 
investigators looking into fridays accident have focused on the 
latching mechanism of the cargo door that tore off and left a 
10by20foot hole in the side of the 18yearold plane 
in december electrical problems were reported more than once in 
the airlines maintenance logs and the forward cargo door had to be 
closed manually national transportation safety board investigator 
lee dickinson said late monday 
in january a seal on the cargo door was repaired he said 
dickinson said he did not know whether those incidents required 
reports to the federal aviation administration he also refused to 
characterize the seriousness of the problems 
we dont know whats normal he said but added it is 
proper to close this door manually 
airline spokesman rob doughty also refused to comment on the 
repairs saying he needed to look at the records 
us transportation secretary samuel skinner said monday that 
although preliminary investigation indicates the cargo door opened 
in flight it was too early to speculate on the cause of the 
accident 
the cargo bay door closes down electrically and manually the 
hatch is hinged at the top and has eight latching mechanisms along 
the bottom attached to the planes frame as well as a latching 
mechanism and a hook pin on each side dickinson said 
boeing co on sunday told the operators of 712 boeing 747s 
worldwide to check the cargo doors but boeing spokesman david 
jimenez said the notices were by no means speculating on the 
cause of the accident 
dickinson said mondays inspection revealed the planes oxygen 
system failed after the accident on the new zealandbound flight 
the accident occurred 100 miles south of honolulu at 22000 feet 
but none of the survivors appeared to suffer longterm affects from 
lack of oxygen officials said 
of the 354 people aboard flight 811 27 were treated at 
hospitals mostly for minor injuries caused by flying debris two 
remained hospitalized monday 
a preliminary review of the cockpit voice recorder showed the 
pilot had no warning of the accident and the cockpit crew discussed 
only emergency procedures afterward not a possible cause or 
warning dickinson said 
he refused to quote the recorder but described it as a good 
tape that captured the accident and its aftermath 
united has refused to allow cronin or the rest of the 18member 
crew to talk to reporters about the flight 
twiggsmith said flight 811 to new zealand and australia and the 
return flight were to be her fathers last after 34 years with 
united 
he said to me there were a couple of times i didnt think we 
were going to make it twiggsmith who also lives in hawaii 
told the newspaper im pretty sure he told me he was scared the 
problem of losing altitude of keeping the airplane up scared him 
hart said her father told her i felt like i needed a cold 
beer when describing his feelings as he flew the crippled 
jetliner 
cronins daughters said the retirement party is still scheduled 
for march 11 in hawaii hart said her father who has returned to 
his home in north lake tahoe nev has expanded the guest list 
he wants to invite all the flight attendants who were aboard 
flight 811 hart said

the chairman of the federal communications 
commission said tuesday he will press toward overhaul of atampts 
pricing system despite congressional concern that the plan will 
lead to windfall profits at the expense of consumers 
after three hours of testimony before skeptical members of the 
house telecommunications and finance subcommittee fcc chairman 
dennis patrick said the agency will vote on the rate cap plan 
for interstate services on march 16 he said it would go into effect 
july 1 if approved unless it is blocked by congress 
although committee members agreed atampts rate structure should be 
changed several complained about the fcc plan and one said it could 
make the company an enormous profitmaking machine 
patrick had postponed the fcc vote from jan 30 because of the 
congressional concern but he said he would not delay it further 
the questions asked by the committee were questions that have 
already been discussed he said after the hearing weve made 
several changes to satisfy their concerns and well continue to 
discuss them but the commission will consider the pricing matter on 
the 16th 
the proposal would change the two decadesold rate of return 
regulation that allows american telephone amp telegraph certain 
specified profits beyond its costs 
the new plan what patrick called incentive regulation 
would place a cap on what atampt could charge customers but would 
allow the telecommunications giant to keep any funds after costs as 
profit the plan did not make it through congress last year but 
patrick is moving the changes through the commission by 
administrative action 
patricks plan to press forward leaves congress under a tight 
deadline to act on the complex matter if opponents are to come up 
with an alternative and subcommittee chairman edward markey 
dmass said at this point we dont have a consensus 
patrick told the subcommittee the change would spur efficiency 
and atampts ability to modernize and develop new communications 
technology to the benefit of consumers in both the short and long 
run 
he said an fcc analysis showed the change would save customers 
900 million over four years with 700 million of the savings going 
to residential customers 
but consumer groups contend the incentive would actually be for 
atampt to seek highervolume corporate business while raising rates 
for consumers 
patrick outlined provisions that would limit atampts ability to 
raise or lower rates for various customers and said he would look at 
other safeguards to ensure price changes for less populated regions 
remain within the zone of reasonableness 
but rep rick boucher dva said that despite making a move 
in the right direction the fcc had not done enough to protect 
consumers 
i think they should not go ahead with the vote in view of 
the bipartisan concerns the committee has boucher said id say 
we would have price caps in due course but under this plan atampt 
could be an enormous profit machine 
rep ron wyden doregon suggested the fcc consider requiring 
that consumers share half of all the profits above a certain level 
a proposal patrick said the commission would discuss 
under the plan patrick outlined at the hearing atampt would have 
to cut overall prices by 3 percent over four years 
the plan would also divide atampts services into three baskets 
one group including residential and small business customers for 
example and allow only certain price increases or decreases for 
each service

the economy grew at a lackluster annual rate of 
2 percent in the final three months of 1988 the slowest pace in two 
years reflecting a worsening trade deficit and the lingering 
effects of the summer drought the government said tuesday 
the commerce department said the slowdown in the gross national 
product the total output of goods and services was accompanied by 
a pickup in the inflation rate as food prices and the costs of 
imports both rose 
while the 2 percent overall growth figure was unchanged from an 
initial report a month ago economists labeled the new gnp 
statistics disturbing because of the weakness in trade the speedup 
in inflation and an acceleration of consumer spending 
the shape of the economy looks worse than we thought said 
david wyss senior financial economist for data resources inc of 
lexington mass all the changes were in the wrong direction 
economists were concerned because the new gnp report showed that 
the countrys trade imbalance worsened even more than previously 
estimated during the fourth quarter as imports grew at an annual 
rate of 13 percent swamping a 7 percent gain in exports 
consumer spending rose at a robust 35 percent annual rate too 
fast given current constraints on production resulting from tight 
labor markets and high operating rates economists said the jump in 
consumer spending which went primarily to bigticket items such as 
cars also showed that americans appetite for foreign goods is 
unabated 
the surge in consumption pulled in more imports with the result 
that the deterioration in the trade deficit was worse than 
previously assumed said jerry jasinowski chief economist of the 
national association of manufacturers 
it marked the second consecutive quarter that the gnp trade 
deficit worsened and served to emphasize economists contention that 
americas trade woes are a long way from being solved 
the fourth quarter gnp increase followed a 25 percent 
thirdquarter rise and was the slowest quarterly increase since a 
14 percent rate in the final three months of 1986 
the fourth quarter figure was depressed by the lingering effects 
of last summers drought without the drought effects the economy 
would have expanded at a 31 percent rate 
on the inflation front a gnp price measure that reflects 
changing consumption patterns rose at an annual rate of 53 percent 
in the fourth quarter up from a 47 percent rate of increase in the 
third quarter 
the gnp deflator rose at rates of 34 percent or less over the 
last three years and economists said the spike above 5 percent would 
set off alarm bells at the federal reserve which has already 
embarked on a new round of credit tightening in an effort to control 
inflation 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan in his first 
congressional appearance since the fed boosted its key bank lending 
rate friday repeated the central banks determination to resist 
any pickup in inflation and called on congress and the 
administration to agree on a credible multiyear plan to reduce the 
budget deficit 
in another economic report tuesday the national association of 
realtors said existing singlefamily home sales fell a sharp 74 
percent in january to an annual rate of 363 million units the 
median price of a home rose 32 percent to 91500 
in a third report the commerce department said that the deficit 
in merchandise trade measured on a balance of payments basis 
climbed to 32 billion in the octoberdecember quarter 10 percent 
higher than in the previous quarter 
economists said all the trade statistics show the improvement in 
trade in the first half of 1988 which accounted for much of the 
economys growth last year has stalled and will mean weaker growth 
in 1989 
for all of 1988 the gnp rose by 38 percent the best annual 
performance since a 68 percent rise in 1984 the annual figure was 
unchanged from the initial estimate last month 
the bush administration is counting on strong economic growth of 
32 percent in 1989 to generate higher government revenues and help 
to reduce the budget deficit without a tax increase 
however many private forecasters are looking for a much smaller 
gnp increase this year of around 27 percent contending that 
continued weakness in trade and the feds credittightening will 
constrain growth 
the central bank is attempting to engineer a soft landing in 
which growth slows enough to control inflation but the economy does 
not weaken so much that the country heads into a recession 
but richard rahn chief economist of the us chamber of 
commerce said tuesday that the weak 2 percent gnp rate in the 
fourth quarter showed that the fed was being overzealous in its 
concerns about inflation

the state department confronted the palestine 
liberation organization tuesday over a raid near israels border but 
withheld any judgment on whether chairman yasser arafat had broken 
his pledge renouncing terrorism 
seizing on a plo request for a meeting in tunis the us 
designated contact ambassador robert pelletreau criticized last 
thursdays raid as having a negative impact on the twomonthold 
usplo dialogue and on prospects for israelpalestinian talks 
there is no ambivalence how we feel spokesman charles e 
redman said we dont condone this type of operation 
three guerrillas from the democratic front for the liberation of 
palestine a radical faction of the plo attacked israeli soldiers 
and christian militiamen in southern lebanon about a mile from the 
israeli border they were gunned down without other loss of life 
the israeli government said the guerrillas were attempting to 
infiltrate israel itself 
in a similar incident five guerrillas from two other factions of 
the plo were intercepted and slain in southern lebanon on feb 4 
secretary of state james a baker iii and spokesman redman 
criticized that attack as well baker said on feb 11 that 
actions such as this directed against civilian or military 
targets inside or outside of israel were something that gave us 
trouble 
after the incident the state department said it was conducting an 
investigation israeli ambassador moshe arad charged the attack was 
evidence that arafat had never given up terrorism 
pelletreaus meeting with the plo official hakam ballaoui in 
tunisia was the fifth with the organization since arafat issued 
statements urged on him by the reagan administration in middecember 
renouncing terrorism and accepting israels right to exist 
at the time richard w murphy who was then assistant secretary 
of state for the near east and other senior us officials said the 
new us dialogue with the plo would be suspended if terrorism 
recurred 
asked if either of the two incidents in southern lebanon were 
instances of terrorism redman said we have said from the very 
start there are going to be things that would have to be addressed 
on a casebycase basis thats what we are doing and as we see 
these various cases that arise we are making our views known to the 
plo 
he said pelletreau had given ballaoui the view of the latest raid 
redman issued on monday it was that the plo cannot escape 
responsibility for the attack and that we do not condone this 
type of activity 
redman said the raids and israels attack tuesday on palestinian 
guerrilla positions in the chouf mountains of lebanon underscored a 
need for security arrangements to protect the people of both 
countries 
we deplore the loss of life and needless suffering of innocent 
people on both sides the spokesman said 
lebanese police said two guerrillas were killed and 38 people 
including 26 children were injured in the israeli bombing

tight limits on the nuclear regulatory 
commission budget during the reagan administration seriously hurt 
the agencys search for ways to improve nuclear plant safety the 
commission chairman told congress on tuesday 
lando w zech jr told a house energy and commerce subcommittee 
that since 1984 the agencys budget had declined even as attention 
to safety needs had increased 
the reductions have had a significant impact on our safety 
research program over the years zech said we believe this 
trend must be reversed 
the nrcs current budget is 426 million compared with 466 
million in 1984 
in presenting the commissions request for an 11 percent overall 
budget increase to 475 million for the year beginning oct 1 zech 
said half the extra money was urgently needed to strengthen 
safety programs 
zech told the panel the safety record of the nations 108 fully 
operating nuclear power plants had improved in recent years but 
stressed that more work was needed by regulators as well as plant 
owners to make nuclear power more reliable 
we have not yet achieved excellence across the board in 
nuclear plant operations he said although plant owners are taking 
safety requirements more seriously 
zech said the nrc with a bigger budget for safety programs 
would increase the number of agency staffers assigned as resident 
inspectors at nuclear plants the commission currently has at least 
one such inspector at each plant 
we believed that the nrc resident inspection program has played 
a significant role in improving industry safety performance and that 
the expansion of the program is necessary to achieve further 
improvements zech said 
the commission chairman also said an agency decision was due as 
early as next week on a proposed rule change aimed at speeding up 
licensing for nuclear plants 
the change would allow utilities to get federal approval for a 
construction permit and an operating license before starting the 
project under current rules the nrc does not consider the 
operating license application until after the construction has 
begun as a result utilities in some cases have completed plants 
but been unable to win approval to operate them 
zech called the proposed change an historic ruling although 
he added that he was still reviewing the proposal and had not 
decided whether to vote for it several members of the committee 
told zech they strongly favored the change 
rep bob clement dtenn said the commission should move 
quickly to adopt the streamlined licensing system in order to 
encourage expansion of nuclear power 
without standardization and licensing reform it is very 
unlikely that there will be additional orders of commercial nuclear 
plants clement said no orders have been placed for nuclear 
plants since 1979 the year of the three mile island reactor 
accident in pennsylvania that raised new safety concerns 
zech also told the panel the nrc was preparing to adopt shortly a 
regulation requiring random drug and alcohol testing of employees at 
all nuclear plants

more than a dozen eminent chinese intellectuals on 
tuesday criticized a proposed dam on the yangtze river as an 
illconsidered wasteful project that would serve only as a memorial 
to its builders 
in a move extremely rare in this authoritarian society the 
informal alliance of of writers engineers and former government 
officials held a news conference to issue a book criticizing the 
hydroelectric project 
there is only one yangtze river and it belows to the entire 
nation and all mankind said dai qing a newspaper editor who 
compiled the book of essays mankind should not abuse it 
we have discussed this back and forth for more than 30 years 
and still cannot resolve the problems said 96yearold sun yueqi 
who heads the economic committee of the chinese peoples political 
consultative committee a prestigious but powerless body of 
intellectuals 
when it comes to producing electricity the dam is no good and 
it will destroy river shipping he said 
the government is in the final stages of studying the proposed 
three gorges hyroelectric project which calls for a 610foothigh 
dam in central china where the mighty yangtze passes through 
towering cliffs eulogized by chinese poets for centuries 
the project would generate up to 17000 megawatts of electricity 
cost estimates range from the official one of about 10 billion to 
some critics estimate of 30 billion 
the idea of harnessing energy from the rivers turbulent passage 
through the three gorges in hubei province first was suggested in 
the 1920s it has been considered repeatedly over the years but 
never acted upon because of the huge expense engineering difficulty 
and what critics say would be serious damage to the environment and 
river shipping 
nearly 1 million people would have to be moved to make way for a 
vast new reservoir the area also has been hit by earthquakes in the 
past and some critics say a quake could crack the dam and cause a 
massive disaster 
leading writer zhang jie told the news conference that backers of 
the project have not evaluated it scientifically but look on it as a 
sort of personal monument we dont want to put up a memorial 
plaque that will win much fame but little benefit she said 
premier li peng formerly minister of power is believed to be 
one of its main supporters proponents say the project would help 
solve chinas energy shortage control flooding and make the upper 
reaches of the river accessible to larger ships 
a canadian consortium of government and corporate experts 
concluded after a twoyear study that the project is feasible and 
rejected many of the objections of the critics however the critics 
noted that several companies in the consortium are potential bidders 
for dam contracts 
tuesdays news conference was the first time a group of 
intellectuals dared to band together and express their opposition 
publicly 
ms dai said the debate had to brought out into the open 
ordinary people know that many large projects have a direct 
impact on them individually she said if the project goes well 
it is called government funded but in reality everyone who pays 
taxes pays for it out of his own pocket ordinary people cannot 
afford not to hear all the viewpoints 
li rui who was vice minister of hydroelectric power in the 1950s 
and vice minister of water conservancy in the early 1980s said 
instead of building one massive dam smaller dams should be built on 
tributaries of the yangtze 
wu jing a senior government engineer who came to listen agreed 
wu said that across town several hundred government experts were 
holding one of a series of meetings to discuss the latest official 
feasibility study 
were having competing meetings he chuckled

its treatment of a wellknown dissident

that he regretted the police action against fang us ambassador 
winston lord met later monday with vice foreign minister zhu qizhen 
and repeated the message

remonstrances bell said adding we have said many times that we 
dont always see eyetoeye on many issues

the united states holds china to a lower human rights standard than 
it does the soviet union and said he hoped this would change 
other dissidents have called on the united states and other 
foreign countries to stop investing in china until the communist 
party ceases human rights abuses

whether lawyers may be forced to represent poor 
people in noncriminal federal cases was the subject of a lively 
debate in the supreme court on tuesday 
john a mallard a lawyer from rural iowa who specializes in 
business cases told the justices he did not feel qualified to 
represent prison inmates in a civil rights suit assigned by a judge 
in my estimation i was not competent to provide the services 
required mallard said 
justice john paul stevens said mallard seemed perfectly capable 
of representing himself before the nations highest court even 
though he had no experience there 
you had the exact same experience in federal civil rights 
cases said stevens is that it you dont need the skills up 
here but you did down there 
mallard said he believed the skills are very different to 
elicit testimony before a jury or argue an appeal before the 
supreme court where there are no witnesses to question 
opposing mallard was deputy attorney general gordon allen of 
iowa who said mallard has a responsibility as a lawyer to do his 
share of pro bono work representing the poor without 
compensation 
lawyers have an ethical obligation allen said adding 
when the court calls i answer 
mallard of fairfield iowa was ordered to represent two current 
inmates and a former inmate at the iowa state prison in fort 
madison the inmates said prison guards and officials had filed 
false disciplinary reports against them physically mistreated them 
and endangered their lives by revealing they were informants 
a federal judge picked mallard in 1987 from a list of more than 
100 lawyers compiled by the legal services corp of iowa and that 
states bar association 
in addition to saying he lacked experience in trial work mallard 
said the federal courts do not have power to require an unwilling 
attorney to represent someone in a civil case 
the possible penalties mallard faces for his refusal to take the 
case were not discussed but presumably he could be held in contempt 
and be fined or jailed 
courts routinely assign lawyers to represent indigent defendants 
in criminal cases and the lawyers are paid at taxpayer expense 
generally a fraction of what they would receive normally 
in civil rights cases lawyers are paid expenses and may receive 
a share of any damages won by their clients 
us district judge harold d vietor denied mallards motion to 
be excused from the inmates suit the judge said mallard was 
competent and had litigation experience 
some justices expressed sympathy tuesday for one of mallards key 
points that the federal law authorizing legal help for poor people 
in civil cases says a judge only may request any attorney to 
take the case 
allen said a request is sometimes a demand for example when a 
general in the army issues it 
words have no meaning if we start talking like that shot 
back justice antonin scalia 
scalia said a lieutenant who refuses a generals request may 
forfeit the opportunity for promotion but the justice added that 
does not mean the lieutenant can be courtmartialed for refusing 
the court is expected to announce a decision in mallards appeal 
by july the case is mallard vs us district court 871490

tamils dressed in military uniforms 
raided a village of sinhalese rice paddy farmers and shot stabbed 
and hacked at least 37 people to death survivors and officials said 
tuesday 
at least 10 children and five women were among the victims of 
monday nights attack by the 20 militants in welikande village in 
the polonnaruwa distict about 100 miles northeast of colombo 
a military official in colombo speaking on condition of 
anonymity said soldiers patrolling the area discovered five bodies 
tuesday raising the toll to 37 
we have a total of 37 corpses 22 males five women and 10 
children most of them hacked to death some of the males had 
gunshot injuries the military official said under briefing 
rules he cannot be identified 
police who were contacted by telephone in polonnaruwa town and 
spoke on condition of anonimity blamed the attack on the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam but a tiger leader telephoned the associated 
press and denied his group was responsible 
an official statement by the tigers said we condemn this as an 
act of terrorism 
the tigers are the most powerful of the tamil separatist groups 
that have been waging a bloody separatist war since 1983 the ethnic 
struggle against the island nations sinhalese majority has claimed 
more than 8500 lives 
the welikande attack was the third massacre of sinhalese 
civilians in northeastern sri lanka this month at least 80 people 
were killed in the three attacks 
on feb 11 36 sinhalese were shot and stabbed to death in 
dutuwewa on feb 22 seven sinhalese were killed at sinhapura 
the tigers information office in london denied the first two 
attacks were the work of their people 
indian troops have been deployed in northeastern sri lanka since 
july 1987 when sri lanka signed an agreement with india aimed at 
ending the tamil insurgency tamils were given a limited measure of 
autonomy while indian troops were deputed to disarm militants among 
the tamils 
after initially agreeing to the accord the tigers reneged and 
returned to opposing the sinhalesedominated government 
welikande is in predominantly sinhalese north central province 
near the border with eastern province which has a mixed sinhalese 
tamil and moslem population 
a former militant tamil leaderturnedlegislator said the tigers 
were on a headlinehunting exercise 
the chief minister of the northeastern administrative council 
varatharaja perumal said the tigers had been badly mauled by 
indian troops and were showing off their fangs by killing innocent 
sinhalese 
perumal earlier headed the eelam peoples revolutionary 
liberation front a rebel militia and former ally of the tigers the 
front surrendered its arms and contested provincial elections in an 
effort to politically realise tamil aspirations 
mostly hindu tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
people militants claim they are discriminated against in education 
employment and culture by the predominantly buddhist sinhalese who 
make up 75 percent of the countrys population and control the 
administration and military

the governors of hereford cathedral who 
caused a national uproar by putting a 13thcentury map on the 
auction block said tuesday that the medieval treasure is no longer 
for sale 
the dean and chapter the governing authority of the cathedral 
said several alternate plans had been proposed to raise about 123 
million for repairs and programs 
there are negotiations with a good many people but if any were 
named or mentioned they might withdraw from the package said 
canon leonard moss 
we are at a fairly delicate stage at the moment but we did 
want people to be aware that we are sufficiently confident to feel 
we do not have to press ahead with the auction in june 
the cathedral had hoped to raise 44 million from the sale of 
the map which shows jerusalem at the center of the world and 
hereford on the edge historical events bible stories animals 
plans and 420 cities are shown on a sheet of vellum measuring 65 
inches by 53 inches 
the map known by its latin name mappa mundi was drawn and 
painted by richard of haldingham in 1275 
moss said the controversy had made the map so famous that it 
could no longer be safely displayed in a dark corner of the 
cathedral and a separate building might be required 
emma nicholson a conservative member of parliament said in 
london that the news was a miracle among miracles 
i was appalled at the idea that a national treasure should be 
auctioned at sothebys as if it was a cracked cup and saucer miss 
nicholson said it is a pearl among pearls beyond price 
lord gowrie the chairman of sothebys and an adviser to the 
cathedral said he felt no regret at losing the sale 
i am particularly happy that the conclusion which i personally 
have always been striving for that the mappa mundi will remain in 
hereford has been achieved he said

colorados fourmonth oxygenated fuels program to 
cut carbon monoxide pollution ended tuesday without having created 
the stir that clouded the mandatory programs debut last year 
there just wasnt the attention on it this year since everybody 
had gone through it once said ted hollman senior air pollution 
control specialist for the state health department 
once people found out all the doomsday predictions didnt come 
true they stopped thinking about it he said 
mechanics in the denver area reported few problems as a result of 
the oxygenated fuels although older cars had more trouble than 
newer ones 
as for suppliers john augustine of conoco said the program was 
much smoother this year because we had a lot of lead time we 
had the whole year to know its coming and get the tanks and 
everything ready 
conoco even plans to continue offering an ethanolblended 
gasoline after the program ends and see how the sales go 
augustine said 
state rep tom ratterree a critic of the program mainly because 
it is mandatory said he still believes the fuels are creating 
problems in peoples cars and motorists simply arent aware of the 
cause 
the car may not run but they dont know why ratterree said 
if i were to generate an awareness level out there then people 
would come out of the woodwork again 
the program was in effect along colorados front range from fort 
collins and greeley in the north to colorado springs in the south 
including the denver area 
the oxygenated fuels are actually blends of ordinary gasoline and 
either grain alcohol ethanol or the etherbased mtbe nearly 2 
million cars and trucks ran on the fuels every day hollman said 
at denvers milehigh altitude ordinary fuel burns incompletely 
in engines and the unexpended fuel emitted into the air adds to 
pollution especially during winter months when temperature 
inversions trap the smog highoxygen fuels burn more cleanly 
last year the oxygenated fuels program ran just two months and 
cut carbon monoxide emissions an average 95 percent officials said 
this year the goal was 12 percent the amount of oxygen required 
in the fuels was increased from 15 percent to 2 percent resulting 
in the use of more ethanol hollman said 
preliminary results of the oxygenated fuels program and the 
threemonth better air campaign which ended in january and included 
voluntary nodrive days and voluntary and mandatory woodburning 
bans were expected later this week 
the combined programs last year dropped denver from first to 
seventh place on the environmental protection agencys list of worst 
cities for carbon monoxide pollution 
the rocky mountain oil and gas association a trade association 
for the industry opposes the programs mandatory provisions and 
disputes its environmental benefits 
as far as consumer satisfaction consumers are relatively 
satisfied because there has been a choice of oxygenated fuels

federal budget deficits were decried tuesday as 
fiscal insanity as the nations governors wound up a meeting 
marked by grudging acceptance of a steady drop in federal aid to the 
states 
a fundamental shift has taken place in american government 
gov gerald baliles of virginia chairman of the national governors 
association told a news conference at the end of the groups annual 
midwinter meeting 
the democrat said that a large measure of the responsibility 
for governing this country has shifted from washington down to the 
states 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine told the closing 
session of the conference that the budget crisis was so critical 
the democratic congress and the republican president had to summon 
the resolve to come up with a plan together to reduce the deficit 
mitchell was responding to democratic gov cecil andrus of idaho 
who referred to the fiscal insanity that presently prevails in 
this city and who asked does the congress have the will this 
year to return us to some form of fiscal sanity 
it cannot be done alone by the congress replied mitchell he 
said any progress would require the cooperation of the 
administration 
the maine senator described the budget as a statement of our 
nations priorities and he pointed out to the governors that they 
had approved policy statements that call for increased federal 
spending in a large number of areas 
at the same time he said the governors association also had a 
policy position which calls for meaningful deficit reduction 
mitchell said he had attended a breakfast meeting with president 
bush and that they reaffirmed this morning our commitment to a 
cooperative effort on the budget and other areas 
the governors put off until their summer meeting action on an 
updated position on the the budget deficit 
there are such a lot of unanswered questions about the details 
of the presidents budget its easy to understand why the governors 
are not yet ready to adopt a budget policy position baliles said 
he said the governors had supported past congressional efforts to 
reduce the deficit and we will support congress this year 
among the policy positions adopted by the governors were 
endorsement of selfdetermination for puerto rico 
support of legislation to require uniform poll closing times 
throughout the continental united states 
tougher emissions standards for automobiles and reauthorization 
of the clean air act 
appropriation of 24 billion in federal assistance to the 
states for construction of wastewater treatment plants the proposed 
federal budget would appropriate only half that amount

the owner of a defunct roller skating rink says a 
city law setting age limits at teen dance halls ruined his business 
he sued and now the us supreme court is reviewing the issue as a 
freedom of association case 
the court has never really squarely faced the issue of an 
individuals right to associate for a purely social or cultural 
purpose said daniel sheehan an attorney for rink owner michael 
stanglin 
craig hopkins the assistant city attorney handling the case 
said he believes the justices want to go on record stating that 
freedom of association in social settings is not covered by the 
constitution a ruling that could effect civil rights as well as 
protecting the recreational gathering places restricted to 
teenagers that have sprung up around the country 
the supreme court is to hear the case wednesday 
stanglins twilight skating rink fell under the dance hall law 
because its floor divided with traffic cones had skating and 
dancing sections a city ordinance enacted in 1985 allows only 
youngsters ages 14 to 18 and their parents or guardians in dance 
halls that serve teenagers 
i think the city was wellintentioned with this but they just 
went over the line stanglin said he contends the ordinance 
unfairly singles out dancing establishments while other gathering 
places such as parks or ice cream parlors allow people of any age 
to associate 
that means that a 19yearold guy cannot come in with his 
18yearold girlfriend he said if you had a 13yearold in 
there youre in violation 
when he began complying with the ordinance stanglin said his 
crowd dropped from 800 one week to about 200 the next then less 
than 20 the third week 
it has cost me a considerable amount of financial tragedy 
said stanglin who closed the twilight in 1986 but owns a second 
rink in a dallas suburb 
stanglin sued the city in july 1986 and a trial court ruled 
against him 
in october 1987 a state court of appeals ruled in stanglins 
favor striking down the part of the ordinance dealing with age the 
court said it interfered with young peoples constitutional right to 
associate with whom they please 
it is primarily the responsibility of the parent not the city 
to tell the minor how old his dance partner may be the appeals 
court said the answer lies in supervision not in strict 
segregation by age group 
the texas supreme court declined to hear the case 
the citys request that the us supreme court reinstate the 
ordinance said the potential harm comes from the association with 
persons who may influence the behavior of the children not only at 
the dance hall where supervision exists but also away from the dance 
hall 
hopkins said the ordinance does not limit freedom of association 
if anything it expands it by creating a special category of dance 
halls where teenagers are allowed he said 
the supreme court already has defined freedom of association in 
political and sex discrimination cases in the 1950s the justices 
upheld the right of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people to withhold its membership list from alabama 
authorities 
in 1984 the supreme court ruled that the jaycees could not 
exclude women the court has ruled that civic groups and private 
clubs may only exclude people by sex or religion when it is 
essential to the organizations purposes

the us trade deficit worsened in the final 
three months of the year climbing to 32 billion as both us 
exports and imports hit record levels the government reported 
tuesday 
the commerce department said the deficit from october through 
december swelled by 10 percent from a third quarter deficit of 
2917 billion 
the trade deficit had shown steady improvement through the first 
three quarters of 1988 helping to push the deficit for the entire 
year down to 1265 billion 217 percent below the alltime high of 
16028 billion set in 1987 
while economists were pleased with the big improvement for the 
year they expressed fears that the improvement has now stalled and 
will hold back overall economic growth in 1989 
the trade deficit has stopped improving said david wyss an 
economist with data resources inc of lexington mass we made 
some big gains in exports in 1987 and 1988 but they havent been 
enough to balance our big appetite for imports 
tuesdays trade figures confirmed an improvement already noted in 
the commerce departments monthly merchandise trade reports those 
figures showed the deficit declining to 13734 billion in 1988 
down from 1703 billion in 1987 
the new report which measures trade on a balanceofpayments 
basis has smaller figures because it subtracts shipping costs and 
military sales from the monthly numbers 
another measure of trade contained in the report on the gross 
national product released tuesday also showed a worsening in the 
deficit for the fourth quarter of 1988 unlike the other trade 
figures the gnp report removes the effects of inflation from the 
import and export numbers 
the report on merchandise trade on a balanceofpayments basis 
showed that exports rose 2 billion to a record level of 836 
billion in the fourth quarter while imports climbed 48 billion to 
a record 1157 billion 
the trade deficit with japan also set a record rising by 32 
billion to 155 billion in the fourth quarter 
the largest increase in imports came in autos up 18 billion 
reflecting higher shipments from south korea japan and mexico 
imports of consumer goods including apparel and household goods 
rose by 16 billion 
on the export side shipments of manufactured goods rose 4 
percent while farm shipments fell by 6 percent 
for the year the decline in the deficit to 1265 billion 
reflected a 28 percent surge in export sales and a 9 percent rise in 
imports 
but wyss said he expected little further improvement in 1989 
saying the trade performance will not move off current high levels 
until the dollar weakens further making imports even more expensive 
and us goods more competitive on overseas markets 
nonfarm exports rose 28 percent to 616 billion in 1988 with 
the largest increases in sales of us capital equipment and 
industrial supplies 
agricultural exports shot up 30 percent to 383 billion their 
highest level since 1984 
the largest increases were in sales of corn which were up 19 
billion reflecting higher sales to the soviet union japan and 
taiwan and in wheat which also climbed by 19 billion reflecting 
higher shipments to china and the soviet union 
the farm sales increase reflected in part higher prices caused by 
the severe drought the average price of corn was up 38 percent for 
the year while the price of soybeans rose by 33 percent wheat 
prices were up 20 percent and cotton prices rose 20 percent

the united states and cuba clashed tuesday over the 
first un report on alleged human rights abuse under havanas 
communist government with each side claiming the report backed its 
stand 
cubas deputy foreign minister raoul roa kouri said the report 
categorically denies us charges that cuban authorities torture 
and execute opponents and imprison thousands of political prisoners 
ambassador armando valladares the chief us delegate and a 
former cuban political prisoner said the report indicates that 
civil political economic and social rights are violated in cuba 
every day in a systematic manner almost without exception 
the exchange over the 400page report came during a debate before 
the united nations human rights commission the document was 
compiled by a sixmember un delegation which visited cuba last 
year in response to pressure by the united states to investigate 
alleged human rights abuse in that country 
the report which was released friday included an extensive list 
of alleged human rights violations along with denials by havana it 
also included official statistics on improvement in education and 
health care since that countrys 1959 marxist revolution 
the delegation which was led by alioune sene senegals 
ambassador to the united nations and included diplomats from all 
major regions made no assessments or recommendations in the report 
it did however include questions on constitutional and legal 
matters the group said had not been answered by cuba 
the united states and several western countries urged the groups 
mandate should be extended by the commission 
president bush said monday the report should begin a longterm 
effort to bring about true and lasting changes in the cuban 
governments performance on human rights 
several western speakers including britain west germany 
belgium portugal and spain voiced concern at the cuban human 
rights situation spains mercedes rico said while there was no 
pattern of massive flagrant and systematic violation of human 
rights restrictions of fundamental freedoms were alarming 
but several third world and communist countries made plain they 
were opposed to a new mandate for the group cuba has said that it 
will not accept further scrutiny 
roa kouri said cuba restricted civil rights to protect itself 
against us aggression he said the missions visit to cuba in 
september followed a stepped up us psychological warfare after 
years of very limited results in efforts to destabilize and defeat 
the revolution 
mexicos chief delegate claude heller said any assessment of the 
cuban situation should take into account the particular 
conditions confronting the country since the revolution including 
even death threats against its leaders

defense secretarydesignate john tower says 
hell stop drinking if the senate confirms him to the cabinet but 
experts on alcohol abuse say believe it when you see it 
professionals who deal daily with drinkers rationalizations say 
vows of sobriety are easily made but rarely kept 
im sure he intends every word that he says the question is 
can he do it said marc hertzman professor of psychiatry and 
behavioral sciences at george washington university i think the 
senate would be illadvised to draw conclusions from that vow 
tower whose nomination comes before the senate this week has 
admitted to heavy drinking in the past but in an extraordinary 
television interview on sunday he said he drinks less now and he 
vowed not to drink beverage alcohol of any type or form including 
wine beer or spirits of any kind if he is confirmed to the 
cabinet position 
hertzman denounces the idea that the urge to drink can be 
controlled so easily 
lets assume that only a very small part of what has been 
rumored about the gentleman has any validity to it at all said 
hertzman the notion that he could just stop is about 180 degrees 
counter to anything that anybody knows about the problem of dealing 
with drinking alcohol 
he said that in some cases six months of total abstinence would 
be convincing but with other people it could take two years or 
more or even be a struggle that lasts a lifetime 
if i were a senator i think at the very least i would defer 
his confirmation until he proves that he can go six months said 
the psychiatrist thats a minimum figure to establish that you 
dont need it a year and a half is more like it 
dr william e flynn director of the alcohol and drug abuse 
clinic at georgetown university said that towers sobriety vow 
alone is not persuasive to professionals in the alcohol treatment 
field 
he said if senators have to base their confirmation decision on 
towers drinking history it would be a tough one 
what a corporation would do for an executive in a similar 
situation is decide that there must be an evaluation but thats 
not possible here said flynn one would feel a lot more 
comfortable if you get an evaluation and a clean bill of health 
tower did release a letter from dr warren lichtliter a dallas 
physician who examined the former senator recently in connection 
with a surgical procedure lichtliter said tower had a normal liver 
function and showed no evidence of alcohol withdrawal 
based on these facts it can be stated with relative certainty 
that senator tower shows no evidence at all of alcoholic impairment 
or alcoholism the texas doctor wrote it is my professional 
view that there is little basis for statements made concerning the 
possible impairment by alcohol of his ability to perform his duty as 
secretary of defense 
hertzman scoffs at that reasoning 
thats baloney pure and simple he said the statement he 
said doesnt tell us everything we need to know in order to 
answer the questions that are relevant 
flynn agrees saying the question is would it be possible to 
present these findings from lichtliter and there still be an 
alcohol problem the answer is yes 
tower said that he once drank scotch heavily but gave it up 12 
years ago and essentially has been a wine drinker only at meals 
since then 
all that tells me is that someone shifted their alcohol intake 
from one form to another said flynn 
a glass of wine is roughly equivalent in alcohol content to a 
jigger of scotch said hertzman everything we know about 
alcohol abuse suggests that it doesnt matter in what form you get 
the alcohol what matters is how much alcohol you get

polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski has 
issued a strong warning that he wont let introduction of greater 
freedoms threaten the countrys communist system 
jaruzelski emphasizing that he was addressing army officers 
decried noisy confrontational and anarchyprone pluralism leading 
nowhere according to excerpts of a speech monday to the communist 
party organization for the pomerania army district the excerpts 
were published tuesday 
jaruzelski spoke the same day prime minister mieczyslaw f 
rakowski apologized to the soviet ambassador to poland for student 
demonstrations over the weekend in which officials say students 
desecrated a monument to soviet soldiers 
authorities have been cautiously introducing increased openness 
and freedom in recent weeks but appear anxious about the 
possibility that the liberalization could lead to chaotic strikes or 
demonstrations that could get out of control 
a question appears here about safeguards so that we will not be 
pushed off the road of socialism that is out of the question 
jaruzelski said in the speech to army officers in the northwest city 
of bydgoszcz according to the official pap news agency 
whoever has such an intention let him put it out of his head 
the fact that i state this at just this place at just this time 
also will be a warning he said 
jaruzelski who imposed 1 years of martial law in poland 
beginning dec 13 1981 said the return of social stability has 
made possible the current talks between the government and the 
opposition 
but he said questions were emerging whether the 13th of 
december 1981 and all of our joint tremendous effort to save poland 
will be threatened and lost by the developing situation this is a 
justified question 
since a january decision by the communist party to permit trade 
union pluralism which cleared the way for the talks on making legal 
again the banned trade union solidarity polish reforms have entered 
a profoundly expanded phase he said 
the talks with solidarity leader lech walesa and other opposition 
leaders began feb 6 
now expolitical prisoners routinely sit at negotiating tables 
across from representatives of the authorities who put them in jail 
underground press reporters question government ministers at news 
conferences and the onceforbidden solidarity emblem is seen in 
public places 
the openness has also been accompanied by dozens of small strikes 
and frequent demonstrations by students and other groups 
there can be an enlightened pluralism creative constructive 
and mobilizing national energy jaruzelski said but there can 
also be a noisy confrontational and anarchyprone pluralism leading 
nowhere 
we intend to expand and consolidate the first one but we 
should and we will condemn and fight the latter 
the party leader who is also commanderinchief of the army 
said poland is threatened by a strikeandprotest festival and 
by attempts at creating anarchy in social life 
apparently referring to recent student protests in krakow 
jaruzelski said i have always been and i still am an advocate of 
reacting with patience and understanding to the emotions of young 
people however there are certain limits and they must not be 
exceeded 
he said the police and education ministries should draw 
appropriate conclusions 
jaruzelski criticized as cowardly some previously silent 
critics who are taking advantage of the new liberalized atmosphere 
to attack authorities verbally 
some blows the party has been suffering are below the belt 
he said some methods be it publications statements or 
declarations closely resemble what we had in 1981 before martial 
law when the rats hurriedly abandoned ship 
that ship socialist poland has been unsinkable and so it will 
stay

fifteen years after the fierce battle began to 
desegregate its schools boston appears to be back at square one 
with school board members split along racial lines over plans to 
improve integration 
civil rights leaders said tuesday theyre ready to go back to 
court unless changes are made in a plan that would end courtordered 
busing by allowing parents to shop around for a school of their 
choice 
its a back door into segregation an old tired rusty car with 
a new coat of paint said louis elisa president of the boston 
branch of the naacp if there isnt substantial change in this 
process which is a resegregation of the public schools the naacp 
does not feel compelled to sit on the sidelines and let that 
happen 
supporters of the school assignment plan say the competition 
would spur improvements lure back whites to the system they fled 
during busing and cut long bus rides 
opponents say the plan could open the door to a further exodus of 
white students and that it could not work without more money to 
improve the overall system 
monday night the nine white members of the school committee 
voted for the plan the four black members voted against it 
ellen guiney education adviser to mayor raymond flynn who is 
supporting the plan said city officials hope to work out an 
agreement with the plans foes but are confident the assignment 
plan will withstand any legal challenge 
under the assignment plan the city would be divided into three 
geographical zones and parents would be allowed to choose within the 
zones provided it did not upset racial balance and there is space 
the plan is scheduled to be implemented this fall for students in 
kindergarten through grade 6 other grades would be assigned in 
september 1990 
thomas atkins an attorney who represented black parents in a 
1972 suit demanding that boston schools desegregate said hes not 
surprised that the city still hasnt laid the desegregation issue to 
rest 
boston and the school committee has never been without those 
whose most fervent desire was to return the system to the mode it 
had before the federal court intervened he said 
busing was imposed in boston in 1974 by order of us district 
judge w arthur garrity jr triggering rockthrowing violence and 
white flight boston schools went from a 1972 population of 96000 
students 60 percent of them white to the current 59000 students 
24 percent of them white 
the system is plagued by a perennial budget crunch and a 40 
percent high school dropout rate 
its poor academic reputation is well known boston university 
basketball coach mike jarvis for example said recently that some 
college recruiters told him they dont recruit players from boston 
because they feel they are a poor bet to keep up academically in 
college 
guiney acknowledged that the school system is in trouble but 
said the assignment plan has at least focused attention on its 
problems 
we do know that the education in the boston schools now is 
generally unsatisfactory to everybody she said the problems 
are serious there is consensus that its a system very nearly in 
crisis 
garrity returned some control of the system to the school 
committee in 1985 in 1987 a federal appeals court ruled that 
boston was complying with desegregation orders 
despite the continuing legal battle atkins said there has been 
progress during the past 15 years with desegregated schools and 
more minority faculty members systemwide 
he said the assignment plan prevents students from transferring 
to a new school if that would upset the racial balance but it does 
not address the effect a students departure would have on the first 
school he said in trying to balance bostons schools any risk of 
imbalance cannot be taken 
its like a rubber band so long as you keep it stretched 
between your two hands it maintains its shape but as soon as you 
let go it snaps back he said

most members of a senate panel are shying away 
from a sixnation foreign trip that their chairman says is not a 
junket but will combine work with visits to museums art 
galleries and religious and historical sites 
in a letter dated feb 7 sen daniel inouye dhawaii new 
chairman of the senate appropriations defense subcommittee invited 
17 colleagues to join him on a trip to germany italy turkey 
egypt israel and spain 
far from being a congressional junket this trip will take us 
to areas which i believe we need to visit to understand the 
dimensions of the problems confronting us national security and to 
meet the responsibilities we face as members of the subcommittee on 
defense inouye wrote the associated press obtained a copy of the 
letter 
the trip is scheduled during the senates easter vacation in the 
last two weeks of march 
i also intend to make a special effort to allow time for visits 
to museums art galleries and religious and historical sites in the 
capitals and the countryside of these countries inouye wrote 
such broad tours are crucial to understanding the shared 
values which link the united states to its friends and allies the 
senator said 
the itinerary calls for three nights in munich three in rome 
two in istanbul three in cairo three in jerusalem and one in 
madrid 
the route was designed to allow members to see fracture 
zones of the geopolitical world said inouye whose subcommittee 
oversees spending for the defense department and the cia 
along the way the senators would share easter services with 
american forces aboard a ship in the persian gulf and review 
fundamental changes under way in the middle east peace process 
inouye urged the senators to bring along their wives because of 
certain responsibilities in the areas of protocol and diplomacy 
associated with meetings with heads of state and highlevel 
officials abroad 
congressional spouses travel free with their mates on military 
aircraft but they must pay their own expenses the government picks 
up all expenses for members of congress they receive daily per diem 
at the same rate as us diplomats abroad for example the daily 
rate is 163 in munich and 98 in cairo 
the congressional party will fly on an air force jet to ensure 
that we accomplish the objectives of our trip and to add a measure 
of security inouye said 
so far only sen frank lautenberg dnj has accepted inouyes 
invitation according to an informal head count hes new on the 
committee and he wants to see all the installations said his 
spokesman steven schlein 
sens arlen specter rpa bennett johnston dla and jake 
garn rutah are undecided about whether to go 
at least 13 subcommittee members said they have no plans to go 
most of them citing prior commitments and more pressing business at 
home 
but sen warren rudman rnh isnt going in part because he 
doesnt like being in a large delegation he tends to prefer 
trips that are more focused said his spokesman paul jacobson 
sen ted stevens ralaska said he didnt have problems with the 
trip but wasnt planning to go because i took those trips when i 
was the chairman of the subcommittee sen patrick leahy dvt 
declined because he recently returned from the middle east an aide 
said 
a state department official familiar with the trip speaking on 
condition of anonymity said arrangements such as the exact dates 
are not yet firm 
in the senate foreign trips on behalf of a committee must be 
approved full committee chairman while those on behalf of the full 
senate must have the approval of the chambers majority and minority 
leaders 
inouye has yet to formally request the approval of sen robert 
byrd dwva chairman of the appropriations committee according 
to marsha berry the committee spokeswoman 
byrd also a member of the defense panel will not accompany 
inouye he plans to travel to west virginia thats the only 
traveling hell do in march said tina evans a spokeswoman

a public television station that pioneered closed 
captions for the hearing impaired has developed a new service that 
makes television vivid for the blind 
by tuning a special channel on a stereo television or home video 
recorder the service allows blind people to hear a narrator 
describe the action in a program between pauses in dialogue 
bostons public station wgbh tested the service last year and 
is now seeking funding to make it available to the nations 
estimated 12 million visually impaired people in january 1990 
i never realized when i watched television from a listening 
perspective that i was missing so much kim charlson recalled 
tuesday blind since the age of 11 the 31yearold watertown 
resident was among thousands of visually impaired people across the 
country who tuned in last year to the services trial run 
television is a major means of communiciation in society 
mrs charlson said theres so much on television you tend to 
feel left out when you cant access it i really commend them that 
theyre trying to do it and do it right 
the new development called descriptive video services allows 
people with visual impairment or even sighted people stepping away 
from their television set to follow the action all they need is a 
stereo television set or vcr that can be tuned to the separate audio 
program channel or sap during a musical interlude or breaks in 
dialogue a narrator is heard above the background music 
wgbh enlisted nine other public tv stations to test the service 
from january to july 1988 on the pbs american playhouse drama 
series stations participated in washington dc metropolitan new 
york city and rochester in new york cleveland and bowling green 
ohio milwaukee dallas pensacola fla and lewiston maine 
a viewer tuned to the play lemon sky for example could hear 
as the credits rolled a mountain silhouette in the distance palm 
trees closer a boys bike between a high brown wooden fence in 
the foreground a white mid50s convertible gleaming in the sun its 
top down 
then later after a character spoke his lines he strolls away 
from the car toward the house pausing in the doorway 
i see it as something that can become widely popular and should 
be said john de witt who evaluates hightech aides for the blind 
at the american federation for the blind in new york 
its not a question only of people who are totally blind de 
witt said in a telephone interview there are millions of people 
who have very poor vision and cannot see small details on the 
screen people who are losing their vision at any time of life 
credit for the idea is given to margaret pfanstiehl founder of 
metropolitan washington ear a radio reading service based in silver 
spring md ms pfanstiehl found a way for theaters to offer 
narration for blind people with audio headsets 
it became accessible for television through stereo tv and vcrs 
after establishment of the separate audio program channel about five 
years ago about 10 percent of american homes can tap the audio 
channel now but laurie everett director of descriptive video 
services predicted they will be commonplace before the turn of the 
century 
in a couple of years you wont be able to buy a television that 
isnt stereo she said 
wgbh is trying to raise funds to launch the service nationally 
five hours a week ms everett said needing 300000 to start up 
and another 1 million annually 
it was 15 years ago that wgbh pioneered closed captioning for the 
deaf with a decoding device viewers can see subtitles across the 
screen captioning is now available on 65 percent of all prime time 
tv its used widely by publicly funded tv as well as on commercial 
cable and videotaped films

the stakes are substantial for president bush 
in the john tower confirmation struggle but lawmakers say a defeat 
in his first major political battle may have no major lasting effect 
on his ability to deal effectively with the democratic majorities in 
congress 
a victory would be an unquestioned personal achievement for the 
president particularly after his decision to take command of the 
lobbying battle at a time when towers chances of confirmation as 
defense secretary were in jeopardy 
the president isnt going to rise or fall on the issue said 
sen william armstrong rcolo who is undecided on the tower 
nomination 
i dont think it sets the stage for the next four years 
agreed sen john breaux dla who is leaning against confirmation 
you can read more into it than is warranted agreed sen 
richard shelby dala a conservative southerner opposed to tower 
he said if the nomination fails bush would take a solid lick but 
it is early in the presidency it depends on how resilient he is 
that is not to say the struggle over tower is without cost 
particularly since it has become a partisan struggle with most 
democrats opposed and most republicans in support 
bush is faced with two equally unpleasant alternatives if it 
becomes clear that tower is not going to be confirmed either to 
withdraw the nomination without a vote or to go down fighting 
either way he comes out a loser 
the administration has been functioning without a defense 
secretary for a month it will be weeks more until one can take 
office if tower is rejected 
for their parts senate democrats are wary of the possible costs 
to themselves of sinking towers nomination they had hoped to avoid 
a showdown with the new president until a later date and democrat 
after democrat was eager to point out to reporters on tuesday that 
bushs other cabinet appointees have all been confirmed without a 
single negative vote 
one senior democratic senator speaking anonymously said 
majority leader george mitchell and armed services committee 
chairman sam nunn were worried about the appearance of 
partisanship in dealing with a newly elected president 
the senate armed services committee has devoted practically all 
of its time to the nomination with hearings on defense strategy 
spending procurement reform and other matters been pushed aside 
nunn dga who has spent years nurturing an image as a 
bipartisan leader of the senate on defense issues has found himself 
squarely in the middle of an issue that has become polarized almost 
entirely along party lines 
sen william cohen rmaine says he has not seen passions 
inflamed over an issue such as this one in several years and says 
it will hinder chances of formulating bipartisan defense and foreign 
policy 
democrats and some republicans whisper that jimmy carter was 
illadvised to withdraw ted sorensons nomination as cia director in 
1977 in the face of senate opposition and believe bush would be 
wiser to stand and fight than to cut his losses and signal tower to 
withdraw 
but there are other senators who have publicly or privately 
suggested that bush withdraw the nomination a move that would 
spare them the need to make an extremely tough decision on how to 
vote 
the effect on bushs ability to deal effectively on other issues 
isnt as easy to calculate 
sen james sasser dtenn said i think the president is 
upping the stake substantially i think if tower is defeated it is 
going to diminish his prestige here in congress 
but sasser who is chairman of the senate budget committee and 
thus most likely to become the senator leading the democrats into 
battle with bush says budget concerns are independent of tower 
i think the administration can recover from the tower problem 
if the nomination is defeated but i think the real question is 
whether the tower problem is symptomatic of the failure of the 
administration to get its program and its policies in a coherent and 
convincing way

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
tuesday that president bushs proposed 1990 budget if adopted 
would trigger lower interest rates even if it eventually produced a 
deficit higher than 100 billion 
greenspan told the senate budget committee that bush has proposed 
significant deficit reduction but he also said the chance of 
bringing the deficit under the congressional target of 100 billion 
by the end of fiscal 1990 is really quite small 
i may say i would like to see grammrudmanhollings targets met 
literally but i dont think that is required to bring a 
significant reduction in interest rates he said 
if after the fact the real number is 110 billion or 120 
billion in that vein i would think that would be a major 
improvement which the markets would take very positively the 
federal reserve chairman said 
in his first congressional appearance since the central bank on 
friday escalated its fight against inflation by raising its key bank 
lending rate greenspan said the federal reserve is trying to slow 
economic growth to a pace sustainable without increased inflation 
he told the senators they could help ease strains in the economy 
and trigger lower interest rates with a credible plan to cut the 
deficit from its 1989 level of about 165 billion however he 
warned against resorting to accounting tricks that reduce the 1990 
deficit without the prospect for further substantial cuts 
what cannot have a positive effect is finding some set of 
bookkeeping gimmicks which largely meet grammrudman for fiscal 1990 
and then paper over 91 92 93 he said 
democratic members of the committee tried several times to prod 
greenspan into criticizing the ecnomic assumptions underlying the 
bush budget which forecasts sharply lower interest rates and brisk 
economic growth 
greenspan said he would have been more cautious in his 
projections but also said the differences between the federal 
reserve and administration were within the range of forecasting 
error 
his response drew a rebuke from sen ernest hollings dsc who 
told him you lose your credibility by the platitudes of that bush 
budget really doing anything to the deficit its a sham 
meanwhile treasury secretary nicholas f brady told the house 
budget committee that both the administration and the federal 
reserve have a firm commitment to fighting inflation 
if theres a difference its two people looking at the same 
statistic and coming to a slightly different conclusion brady 
said in an attempt to soften previous criticism of the central bank 
i am already convinced that interest rates will come down 
once congress and the administration agree on a deficitreduction 
package brady said in turn he added such an agreement would 
allow the economic assumptions on which bushs budget are based to 
be met 
at the senate appropriations committee white house budget 
director richard darman came under fire from democrats angry with 
bush for failing to specify the spending levels he would like to see 
for hundreds of programs 
the focus of the criticism was the more than 1000 mostly 
domestic programs that bush has proposed limiting to 136 billion in 
spending next year the same amount as this year democrats have 
complained that bush has not revealed how he would accomplish this 
freeze 
it makes me wonder if the administration is leading us into the 
age of joe isuzu federal budgeting said committee chairman robert 
byrd dwva referring to the transparent liar portrayed in a 
series of television commercials 
darman said that except for areas in which bush had advanced 
specific initiatives the administrations starting point in budget 
negotiations with congress would be support of the proposals made by 
former president reagan 
he also said the administration has given congress hundreds of 
pages of explanatory materials since bush unveiled his spending plan 
on feb 9

prices farmers got for raw products declined 
07 percent from january to february but still averaged 14 percent 
more than a year ago the agriculture department said tuesday 
the departments agricultural statistics board said in its 
preliminary report that lower prices for soybeans lettuce milk and 
corn were mostly responsible for the decline from the january 
average 
higher prices for tomatoes strawberries potatoes and hay partly 
offset the decline in the other commodities 
prices of food grains increased from january to february while 
feed grains and oilseed prices decreased the report said the 
allwheat price moved to the highest level since april of 1981 but 
the average corn and soybean prices dropped from january to 
february 
tomato prices moved up sharply during the month and the february 
average for cattle and calves was the highest since may 1979 
the report also included revisions showing that prices received 
by farmers actually rose 28 percent from december to january 
instead of the 14 percent gain reported a month ago 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter meanwhile told congress 
that the farm economy as a whole is continuing to make real 
progress in recovering from the hard times of the early and mid 
1980s 
last years drought helped reduce supplies of major crops 
including corn soybeans and wheat which has resulted in higher 
prices 
the higher prices have helped maintain a high cash income level 
for those farmers with supplies to sell and for the sector as a 
whole yeutter told the house budget committee 
however he added the drought dealt a severe blow to many 
producers in drought areas who lost much of their crop and who did 
not have prioryear crops to sell it also placed a heavy burden on 
livestock poultry and dairy producers who were faced with higher 
feed costs 
according to the preliminary february price figures based mostly 
on midmonth averages the index for livestock and livestock products 
as a group declined 06 percent from their january average but was 
still up 54 percent from february 1988 
the departments allcrops price index for february was down 14 
percent from january but averaged 27 percent above a year ago 
no new price figures for farm production costs were included in 
the february report those have been confined to quarterly averages 
because of budget cutbacks 
in january however new quarterly figures showed that prices 
paid by farmers to meet expenses were up 12 percent from last fall 
and were 61 percent higher than a year earlier 
although the projections are subject to change usda economists 
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of 48 
billion to 52 billion this year compared with a nearrecord of 57 
billion in 1988 that is the difference between cash receipts and 
cash expenses during the calendar year 
department economists say cash expenses are expected to rise 
moderately in 1989 with expanded crop acreages and costlier 
production items 
food prices in 1988 rose an average of 37 percent usda analysts 
say another increase of 3 percent to 5 percent is likely in 1989 
the report said 
cattle averaged 7070 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally 
up from 7060 in january and 6740 in february 1988 those are 
averages for all types of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 40 per 100 pounds compared with 4090 in 
january and 4580 a year earlier 
corn at 254 a bushel was down from 260 in january but up 
from 183 a year in february 1988 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 403 per bushel compared with 401 in january and 279 
a year earlier 
rice averaged 655 per 100 pounds up from 647 in january 
rice was 937 a year earlier 
soybeans were 723 per bushel compared with 769 in january 
and 596 a year earlier 
upland cotton was reported at 531 cents per pound down from 
539 cents in january and 57 cents in february 1988 
eggs were 621 cents per dozen compared with 639 cents in 
january and 469 cents a year earlier 
milk was 1310 per 100 pounds compared with 1340 in january 
and 1230 a year earlier 
broilers were 352 cents per pound live weight compared with 
353 cents in january and 257 cents a year ago

helicopterriding firefighters dropped incendiary 
bombs along the route of a 10milelong everglades wildfire tuesday 
to corral the spreading blaze and prevent it from damaging nearby 
interstate power lines 
meanwhile state forestry workers battled scores of other brush 
fires around the state including a 4000acre blaze just east of 
naples on floridas southwest coast and a 500acre fire brought 
under control just south of jacksonville 
the largest wildfire was burning sawgrass in the everglades 
moving north along us 27 toward the palm beach county line and 
running parallel to utility transmission lines that were shut down 
again tuesday to avoid blackouts 
firefighters initially tried to enter the swampy grassland in 
allterrain vehicles to pack down the sawgrass and create a 
firebreak but on tuesday flames spread to 6500 acres burning an 
area a mile across and 10 miles in length along us 27 
our people were getting stuck its very wet out there said 
david utley duty officer at the fire weve decided to change 
tactics and use the helicopter to fight fire with fire instead of 
water 
the firefighers dropped small pingpongsize balls filled with 
potassium permanganate and ethylene glycol under the transmission 
lines and along the western edge of the fire florida power amp light 
co shut off power through the wires for four hours during the 
backfire operation 
the balls drop out and when they hit the ground a chain 
reaction starts and they catch on fire in about 45 seconds utley 
said 
the plan is to funnel the fire toward a canal blocking its path 
to the north he said 
the fire which he said was apparently set sometime sunday 
morning did not directly threaten the 500000volt utility lines 
or any inhabited areas and firefighers hoped their new tactics 
would have it under control within 24 hours utley said 
arson also figured in many of the other 65 fires the forestry 
division was fighting monday and tuesday said charles maynard 
spokesman for the agency in tallahassee 
rainfall averaging only a third to a half of normal since the 
fall has made the fires much more dangerous as in 1985 when fires 
burned over 100000 acres around the state and caused a miami 
blackout 
its not as bad as in 1985 but it has the potential for 
getting worse he said we have certainly not had the rainfall 
across the state that we need 
the national weather service was forecasting scattered showers in 
some parts of the state over the next few days but nothing that 
would alleviate the growing fire danger maynard said

a mysterious man linked to the medellin 
cocaine cartel acknowledged he forged millions of dollars in 
greenbacks and passed thousands along the usmexico border a top 
law enforcement official said tuesday 
the man passed at least 100000 worth of the phony money at an 
unidentified bank in el paso texas before he was arrested saturday 
across the border in ciudad juarez officials said 
deputy attorney general javier coello trejo told a news 
conference that mexican and american treasury experts are trying to 
determine where the rest of the nearperfect fakes went 
the us treasury experts we brought in were scared when they 
saw the bills which were in 10 20 and 50 denominations they 
were almost perfect coello said passing a couple of fake 100 
bills to journalists 
coello said the mans identity is still a mystery despite 
extensive questioning he said the suspect had given the names of 
newton peter von gramm and newton peter von shultz among others 
he went under many aliases and he operated in canada for quite 
awhile before coming to mexico coello said adding it is not 
clear if the man is a german canadian or us citizen 
the man was arrested saturday along with eight mexicans when 
federal judicial police received a tip and raided a number of 
clandestine engraving shops police seized at least 11 million 
worth of us bills 
the man came to mexico and hired two people from tlaxcala 
state specialists in printing and set up the engraving shops in 
juarez they did some top work he said holding a fake bill up to 
the light 
we dont know yet how much money was forged we are still 
counting up until today we have counted about 11 million coello 
said 
the nine suspects were flown to mexico city on sunday for further 
questioning and possible indictment forging currency is a federal 
offense in mexico 
coello said the man admitted he was connected to the medellin 
cartel and he had sent a sum of money to colombia through some 
traffickers in monterrey which federal agents are investigating 
we have already advised them and sent the information we have 
to authorities in colombia about that coello said 
the medellin cartel named after the colombian city which is it 
home base is considered the worlds largest cocaine trafficking 
ring 
a source at the attorney generals office who insisted on 
anonymity said the cartel may be running out of dollars as a result 
of a crackdown on money laundering in colombia mexico and the 
united states and may be resorting to fake currency to meet expenses

a house subcommittee approved legislation 
tuesday to require large employers to provide up to 10 weeks of 
unpaid leave for parents to spend with new children 
the measure also would require employers to make 15 weeks leave 
available to workers who need time off to care for a seriously ill 
parent or child 
the bill which cleared the education and labors subcommittee on 
labormanagement relations on a 115 vote is similar to senate 
legislation strongly pushed for the last two years by sen chris 
dodd dconn 
the house bill now goes to the full education and labor 
committee where approval is considered certain 
the dodd bill reached the senate floor for debate last year but 
died for lack of action the full house did not debate its version 
of the legislation last year 
the house bill would apply to employers with 50 or more workers 
for the first three years and to those with 35 or more workers after 
three years 
backers estimate the house measure would cover about 39 percent 
of the us labor force the first three years and 43 percent 
thereafter 
the dodd bill would apply to employers with 20 or more workers 
or about 47 percent of the total workforce 
although employers would not have to pay salary to workers on 
leave business generally opposes the legislation on grounds it 
would be disruptive to planning and because employers would have to 
continue paying any health insurance premiums for the employee on 
leave 
while the senate took the lead last year the informal plan now 
being worked out among proponents for parental leave legislation is 
for the house to go first this year while the senate concentrates on 
child care subsidies 
however democratic leaders in both houses have said their first 
priority on labormanagement issues this year is raising the current 
335 an hour minimum wage 
bills on the minimum wage child care and parental leave all 
received extensive debate last year democratic leaders on both 
sides of the capitol are moving quickly to get bills on the floor 
again this year with only minimal time for rearguing the issues in 
the committees

the district of columbia council in a new 
attack on drugrelated crime in the nations capital voted tuesday 
to bar many teenagers from congregating on street corners and other 
public areas late at night and during the early morning hours 
but it refused to act immediately on mayor marion barry jrs 
proposed emergency city legislation to create a mandatory fiveyear 
prison term for anyone using guns to commit crimes the council 
decided more time is needed to study that proposal 
the council approved a curfew that would bar those under age 18 
from gathering on street corners parks or other public areas 
between 11 pm and 6 am on sunday through thursday and from 
midnight to 6 am on friday and saturday 
parents of a curfew violator would face no penalty in the case of 
a first offense but would pay 100 if there is a second offense 
200 for a third one and 500 for additional violations 
the emergency measure came as the city attempted to slow the pace 
of drugrelated killings police blame about 60 percent of last 
years record 372 killings on drugs so far this year 90 people 
have been slain in the district 36 more than during the matching 
period last year 
however frederick cooke the citys chief attorney said the 
bill may not slow the growth of drugrelated homicides 
the fact of the matter is the average age of the homicide 
victim in the district of columbia is 30 years of age and the 
average age of perpetrators of these homicides is in excess of 18 
years of age cooke said its not going to really address the 
problem significantly 
the council decided to study barry proposal to require fiveyear 
prison terms for people who commit crimes with guns 
the council agreed with its chairman voting to delay action 
until the proposal barry submitted late monday can be examined 
we just need some time to review this matter said council 
chairman david clarke weve had some comments from us attorney 
jay stephens and requests for more time 
clarke has scheduled a briefing from city officials on the bill 
and indicated he could convene a special session to enact the 
legislation perhaps as early as wednesday 
were not going to let these guncarrying thugs dope dealers 
feel that because we have some difficulties in our jail 
population that theres no room barry told a citizens group 
monday night we will find room find places for them to stay in 
jail 
at a news conference earlier barry said the city is starting 
an allout assault on weapons 
barrys proposal would strengthen the penalty in the citys 
misdemeanor gun law which already provides for a maximum punishment 
of one year in jail and a 1000 fine for those caught with 
unregistered weapons 
barrys bill also proposes redefining the citys bail laws so 
that those caught carrying an unregistered weapon selling drugs or 
using a weapon in an assault could be denied release before trial 
barry wants to create a drugfree zone of up to 1000 feet 
from city schools under that bill those caught using or selling 
drugs in those areas would face an additional threeyear jail term 
barry acknowledged that his measures would add still more 
prisoners to the citys jail system which is already operating 
under court orders requiring a reduction in overcrowding inmates 
have been sent to several states to help alleviate that problem

with few exceptions officials and newspapers in the 
far east rated president bushs fastpaced visit a success in 
showing the importance the new us administration puts on relations 
with asian countries 
bush returned to washington on monday night after a fiveday 
swing to japan china and south korea his first overseas trip as 
president asian commentators said it was the first time a new 
president had visited asia before europe and said the trip was 
extraordinary in coming so early in bushs tenure 
the official xinhua news agency in china called it an unusual 
diplomatic initiative and said china looms large in bushs 
foreign policy over the years he has attached importance to 
chinas role in world affairs and cared for the expansion of 
uschina relations 
in tokyo bush met leaders of 20 foreign countries in the swirl 
of funeral diplomacy among dignitaries paying respects to the 
late emperor hirohito his stop in seoul let him reassert the us 
determination to maintain its troop strength in south korea and 
support for democratic reforms and in beijing his presence lent a 
counterbalance to the warming of sinosoviet relations 
his visit clearly indicates the importance the bush 
administration attaches to asia the liberal japanese daily asahi 
shimbun said in an editorial 
bushs talks covered hot spots such as the korean peninsula and 
cambodia as well as the softer issues of trade and human rights 
with a notable flap in beijing when chinese police prevented 
dissident fang lizhi from attending a banquet to which bush had 
invited him 
the chinese while saying bushs visit would enhance sinous 
friendship were angry at what they saw as us interference in 
their affairs 
communist party leader zhao ziyang said the fact that some 
americans support those chinese who are not satisfied with the 
chinese government will be detrimental not only to chinas policial 
stability and the progress of its reforms but also to the sinous 
friendship 
the conservative hong kong daily south china morning post said 
bush had been illadvised to invite fang 
it was a rash and provocative gesture it said in an 
editorial china in turn overreacted foolishly by physically 
ensuring that the outspoken activist was not able to attend 
in thailand the conservative englishlanguage bangkok post said 
the fang incident showed china was as authoritarian now as in the 
1970s when bush served as us envoy to beijing it also showed the 
americans that their road to chinese favor is just as bumpy as 
that of the russians the bangkok post said 
thai government spokesman suvit yodmani said bushs talks with 
other world leaders gave them a good opportunity to reaffirm their 
commitments and promote relations with more countries 
south korean president roh taewoo after talks with bush said 
they would work to resolve various problems resulting from the 
rapid expansion of economic relations between our two countries 
a reference to trade frictions 
roh said he had briefed bush on efforts to reduce tensions with 
north korea that countrys official media sounded a sour note in 
denouncing bushs visit to seoul and demanding that us troops be 
withdrawn from south korea 
the rodong sinmun daily of the ruling north korean workers 
communist party said bushs visit would be marked by aggression 
and treachery between the new master and the new servant 
the liberal australian daily the sydney morning herald said 
bushs trip was a welcome reassurance of the continued us 
commitment to the asiapacific region it suggested that 
washington propose a reversal of the arms buildup in the northern 
pacific and also measures to reduce the risk of regional conflict 
that would test the sincerity of soviet president mikhail 
gorbachevs stated desire to reduce tensions in asia and the 
pacific it would also give the us an edge in the disarmament 
debate in the region and may lead to agreements easing the security 
concerns of japan south korea and china the sydney paper said 
the independent indonesian daily kompas commenting on bushs 
call for progress in removing vietnamese troops from cambodia said 
washington has less at stake in cambodia than china and the soviets 
but still can contribute to the efforts to find a political 
solution to the problem 
japans largest daily the middleoftheroad yomiuri shimbun 
welcomed the us intention to play an active role in asia 
asia is undergoing dynamic economic development the yomiuri 
said it is also in the process of the rearrangement of 
multilateral relations which was set in motion by sinosoviet 
reconciliation the united states must play its part

east the first verdict in a series of weapons sales scandals 
the district court absolved mats lundberg a former marketing 
director of swedish arms manufacturer nobel kemi of charges that he 
sold 1300 tons of explosives worth 12 million to blacklisted 
countries including syria and egypt

war or in areas of conflict 
the court also acquitted karlerik schmitz an independent trader

owned nobel kemi during the 1981 to 1985 period lundberg had been 
accused of making the illegal sales

being used in the iraniraq war sweden last year tightened its 
export regulations

the supreme court in a defeat for unions 
ruled tuesday that railroads and airlines may penalize strikers by 
giving their jobs to employees with less seniority who stay on the 
job or return to work before the strike ends 
the 63 decision was described by the dissenters as inherently 
destructive of the right to strike but defended by the courts 
majority as a lawful exercise of an employers power 
the court ruled that trans world airlines legitimately exercised 
its peaceful economic power when it refused to rehire thousands 
of striking flight attendants after the walkout ended 
many of the jobs went instead to flight attendants who remained 
at work or abandoned the strike to return to work those employees 
are called crossovers for crossing the picket line 
justice sandra day oconnor writing for the court said twa had 
the right to retain crossovers just as it has the power to hire new 
employees to replace striking workers 
that this decision had the effect of encouraging prestrike 
workers to remain on the job during the strike or to abandon the 
strike and return to work before all vacancies were filled was an 
effect of the exercise of twas peaceful economic power she said 
rex hardesty spokesman for the aflcio here expressed regret 
over the ruling but added we have to live it 
mona zeiberg a lawyer for the us chamber of commerce said 
its a positive ruling for business 
the decision was based on an interpretation of the federal 
railway labor act which governs airlines as well as railroads 
while it does not apply directly to other industries oconnor 
said most employers have enjoyed the same power since a 1938 supreme 
court ruling 
she said the court then interpreted the national labor relations 
act to allow employers to give strikers jobs permanently to workers 
who did not honor the strike 
justice william j brennan in a dissenting opinion disputed 
oconnors understanding of the 51yearold ruling 
he said the 1938 decision applied only to workers hired from 
outside the company 
since that ruling he said it has been accepted that an 
employer may hire permanent replacements who need not be 
displaced to make room for returning strikers 
but he said the 1938 decision has not been applied before now to 
members of the striking bargaining unit who have crossed the 
picket lines 
tuesdays ruling is inherently destructive of the right to 
strike as guaranteed by the railway labor act and the national labor 
relations act brennan said 
the case stems from a dispute between twa and the independent 
federation of flight attendants iffa the flight attendants 
threeyear contract expired july 31 1984 and the union called a 
strike on march 7 1986 when negotiations failed 
twa hired more than 2350 new flight attendants and trainees 
after the strike began in addition some 1280 twa flight 
attendants crossed picket lines either at the outset of the walkout 
or as the strike continued for more than two months 
after the strike ended the union filed a federal lawsuit 
charging twa with illegally refusing to reinstate most of the 5000 
striking workers who stayed out the two months 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled in 1987 that striking 
flight attendants were entitled to their old jobs at the expense of 
less senior flight attendants who had crossed the picket lines 
the flight attendants hired during the strike were allowed to 
keep their new jobs and were not affected by that ruling or 
tuesdays decision that reversed the 8th circuit court ruling 
oconnor said preferential treatment for crossovers does not 
violate seniority protections because workers who stayed out on 
strike but were reinstated after the walkout ended retain their 
seniority rights over crossovers with less seniority 
she was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
byron r white john paul stevens antonin scalia and anthony m 
kennedy besides brennan the other dissenters were justices 
thurgood marshall and harry a blackmun 
the supreme court in a 44 ruling a year ago in another case 
stemming from the twa strike held that an airline may be forced to 
continue collecting union dues from workers after its contract with 
the employees has expired 
twa had sought to discontinue the dues checkoff after the strike 
ended the supreme courts tie vote upheld a lower court ruling that 
the airline may not cancel the checkoff provision unless it is 
agreed to in negotiations with the workers

irans parliament voted tuesday to sever 
ties with britain restored to normal just three months ago unless 
it condemns the satanic verses and stops criticizing iran for 
ordering the author killed 
the official islamic republic news agency said the parliament 
gave britain a week to meet the conditions but prime minister 
margaret thatchers government made clear it would not do so 
the british position will not be altered by threats of any 
kind william waldegrave minister of state in the foreign office 
said in london 
mrs thatcher told the house of commons freedom of speech and 
expression are subject only to the laws of this land and will 
remain subject to the rule of law it is absolutely fundamental to 
everything in whic we believe and cannot be interfered with by any 
outside force 
mohammed basti irans charge daffaires said on television 
before leaving britain it is very unfortunate your government has 
taken the lead in making this matter a purely political subject 
salman rushdie 41yearold author of the satanic verses was 
born in bombay india to moslem parents but now is a british 
citizen and does not practice religion actively 
he has been in hiding since feb 14 when iranian patriarch 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini commanded followers to kill him 
khomeini and many other moslems believe rushdies novel blasphemes 
islam and the prophet mohammed 
in its first coment on the controversy the soviet union said the 
kremlin leadership expressed concern 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said eduard a 
shevardnadze the soviet foreign minister discussed the matter for 
two hours with foreign minister ali akbar velayati and president ali 
khamenei during a threeday visit to iran that ended monday 
gerasimov said shevardnadze will raise the issue with secretary 
of state james a baker iii and other foreign ministers at a meeting 
march 7 in vienna 
charles redman the state department spokesman said tuesday in 
washington the united states and britain had urged shevardnadze to 
bring the subject up in tehran 
every civilized nation has an international responsibility to 
state its abhorrence to death threats he said no responsible 
member of the community of nations should let them go unanswered 
irna said the decision by the majlis the iranian parliament was 
endorsed by the council of guardians 12 clerics and laymen who must 
approve legislation 
it said nearly all the 201 deputies attending tuesdays 
session voted for the bill introduced two days ago the majlis has 
270 members but some were absent and the credentials of others have 
not been approved since elections in april and may 
the news agency gave this text of the bill from the date of 
the approval of this law if the british government does not 
officially declare in a maximum period of one week its opposition to 
the unprincipled stand against the world of islam and the islamic 
republic of iran and to the contents of the antiislamic book the 
satanic verses the foreign ministry of the islamic republic of 
iran is obliged to break all bilateral political ties 
deputies stood cheered and praised mohammed and his descendants 
after the vote the report said according to irna the amendment 
giving britain a week to comply with irans demands was proposed by 
more than 100 deputies 
parliament has been dominated since the elections by radical 
factions that do not always agree 
tuesdays debate indicated many members do not fully support 
khomeinis declaration that iran does not need relations with the 
west which he considers decadent and antiislamic or more liberal 
policies following the truce last august in the eightyear war with 
iraq 
britain recalled its five diplomats from tehran and asked irans 
representatives to leave after khomeini passed the death sentence on 
rushdie to which iranian clerics added a reward of 52 million 
its 11 partners in the european economic community were joined by 
norway sweden and canada in withdrawing their top diplomats from 
iran which also recalled its ambassadors to eec nations 
british diplomats returned to tehran in december after a period 
of virtually no representation that began in 1987 with the arrest of 
an iranian diplomat in northern england on shoplifiting charges 
the embassy was closed for nine years and iran had long 
considered britain its secondranking enemy in the west after the 
united states 
tehran radio said in a commentary the majlis vote marked a 
turning point in iranian foreign policy the first time iran took 
the initiative in ending ties 
the islamic republic has demonstrated that it does not want 
relations at any price the radio said the iranian parliaments 
reaction to antiislamic activities is a warning to governments 
which are in any way involved in the struggle against islam and 
moslems 
irna quoted foreign minister velayati who had advocated more 
open relations with other countries as saying before the vote we 
agree with the proposal and in future this will be our stand toward 
any country which attacks islam and islamic sanctities safeguarding 
the interests of islam is not an easy job

a task force of aviation industry and 
government safety experts proposed tuesday that the worlds airlines 
be ordered to do 800 million in work on older boeing 747s 737s and 
727s 
but the task force moving to ensure the safety of an aging 
international airline fleet said none of the proposed repairs was 
urgent and all could be done over several years time 
the group set up the air transport association which represents 
major us airlines asked the federal aviation administration to 
issue a massive airworthiness directive making mandatory 
modifications and replacements recommended in 150 boeing co service 
bulletins 
transportation secretary samuel skinner applauded the proposal 
and said the faa already had begun procedures required to issue the 
massive airworthiness directive called for by the task force 
the faa has jurisdiction over planes flown by us carriers 
regulatory bodies in other countries issue the rules under which 
those nations planes operate 
the transport association estimated that 30 percent to 40 percent 
of the affected planes fall under faa jurisdiction 
the proposed work would apply to more than 1300 boeing aircraft 
worldwide at an average cost of 600000 per plane a boeing 
representative on the task force joined in the unanimous vote to 
make his companys recommendations mandatory 
clyde kizer transport association vice president said the 
proposed repairs and replacements would be tied to the number of 
times an airliner had taken off and landed and its time in the sky 
emphasizing that none of the work was considered pressing kizer 
told a news conference there are no dangerous aircraft out there 
flying right now 
parts affected would include joints fittings outside skin and 
some structural materials kizer said 
what we are suggesting he said is that at some point in 
an aircrafts history it is no longer acceptable just to inspect 
the faa now requires airlines to conduct regular inspections of 
older aircraft and in most cases to make repairs and changes when 
problems are found 
the task force proposal would mandate the replacement of specific 
aircraft parts according to how much a plane had been used rather 
than its chronological age 
kizer said the release of the report which followed nine months 
of work had nothing to do with fridays incident in which nine 
people died after a hole opened in the fuselage of a united airlines 
747 over the pacific ocean 
investigators probing the crash are focusing on the possibility 
of a cargo door problem that could be related to aging kizer said 
the task force proposal covered no work involving cargo doors on 
747s 
the group which also includes international aviation experts and 
us government representatives began its work partly in response 
to an april 1988 incident in which part of the roof of an aloha 
airlines 737 peeled away over hawaii sucking a stewardess to her 
death 
the average age of the worlds 8800 airliners is just over 13 
years according to avmark an aviation appraisal firm its latest 
survey done in july showed the average us airliner in service 
was 1267 years old 
service records of older mcdonnell douglas aircraft such as 
dc10s dc9s and dc8s and aircraft build overseas are also being 
studied by task force committees they are due to make 
recommendations later this year 
ben cosgrove a boeing vice president who was on the task force 
said his company supported the recommendations announced tuesday 
while aging airliners continue to be safe if properly inspected 
and maintained he said we dont want to continue to inspect 
them for potential problems preferring instead that work 
suggested in the bulletins be carried out 
airlines participating in the task force said they did not expect 
immediate major expenses in part because they have already done or 
planned much of the work voluntarily 
we dont anticipate anything over and above what weve already 
planned to do said bob doll a united air lines vice president 
who helped draw up the recommendations 
pan american president thomas g plaskett who did not 
participate in the task force said his airline fully supports the 
proposal unless we do this the us fleet is not going to be big 
enough to meet the demand he said 
he noted that half the worlds airliners are over 20 years old 
while increased air travel and the growing world demand for 
airliners is forcing carriers to wait several years for the delivery 
of new jets

the remainder of the federal government which has not had anybody 
in that job before im sure he is going to meet some

requirement of coming up with a plan and how he intends to go about 
that an understanding of the authority and willingness to exercise 
the authority to implement that plan from a budget standpoint as 
well as a broader administration position standpoint the senator 
said

enforcement officer to make up for his lack of law enforcement 
background does he think he needs someone in one of his two deputy 
spots with background in existing programs education as well as 
treatment 
paul smith an aide to sen orrin g hatch rutah said the 
senator expects the democrats to bring up bennetts lack of law 
enforcement background still he added bennett is going to get 
out of the hearings without major problems it should be smooth 
sailing for him

jamaicas new prime minister michael manley 
has hired a washington lobbying firm neill and company to promote 
us economic aid to his caribbean island a lobbyist for the firm 
said tuesday 
the lobbyist speaking on the condition of anonymity said his 
company has been asked to seek more direct congressional aid for 
jamaica as well as possible loans and guarantees from us 
government institutions 
in addition manley wants the lobbyists to pursue private us 
investment in jamaica the lobbyist said neill and companys other 
clients include pakistan kenya and morocco 
manleys election earlier this month raised some concern in 
washington because of his past socialist policies as prime minister 
from 1972 to 1980 manley forged close ties with cubas fidel castro 
and brought in scores of cuban doctors and technicians 
his successor conservative edward seaga closed cubas embassy 
in kingston and turned to washington 
manley has decided to reopen cubas embassy but has promised the 
united states he will limit the cuban presence in jamaica 
obviously were not in agreement with that policy said a 
state department official also requesting anonymity we feel cuba 
should be isolated in the caribbean but jamaica is a sovereign 
nation and has the right to conduct its diplomacy 
manley is planning an official trip to washington in the spring 
or summer and the white house is trying to work out a meeting with 
president george bush 
we want to get off to a good start with him the state 
department official said 
the united states has given jamaica more than 150 million in 
recent months for reconstruction of the damage from last septembers 
hurricane gilbert jamaica received 476 million in us food and 
development aid in 1988

a highlevel advisory commission created to 
craft a bipartisan solution to the countrys deficit woes ended up 
deadlocked and will issue a report wednesday split virtually along 
party lines according to members of the commission 
the national economic commission will issue a final report 
supported by the seven republicans on the commission and one 
democrat appointed by president bush thomas ashley a former 
congressman from ohio officials said 
the majority report endorses bushs stand against new taxes and 
his proposal to cut the capital gains tax 
the minority democratic report supported by the six members 
appointed by the partys congressional leadership will critize the 
presidents flexible freeze as an insufficient response to the 
critical problem of the deficit but will stop short of endorsing new 
taxes to deal with the deficit officials said 
commission member rep william h gray iii a member of the 
democratic house leadership and a former house budget committee 
chairman blamed partisanship by republicans for the groups failure 
to succeed 
the president didnt want a bipartisan deficiteduction plan 
he said he wanted his own plan the flexible freeze and he 
insisted on it from republican members 
gray said that as a result instead of something bold that 
could have moved us forward we end up leaving it to congress and 
the administration to continue the fight 
the 14member commission was created by congress following the 
october 1987 stock market crash the panels supporters hoped the 
group which was given a march 1 1989 reporting date would be 
able to devise a plan to solve the governments huge budget deficits 
early in the presidential campaign however bush derided the 
panel which had the support of his republican primary opponent 
sen bob dole rkan as nothing but a stalking horse for tax 
increases 
after being elected bush did appoint the final two members to 
the panel ashley and former sen paul laxalt rnev but after 
taking office bush refused to extend the panels reporting deadline 
for six months as some members had hoped he would to give the panel 
more time to reach a consensus 
that decision all but sealed the panels fate and with only a few 
weeks remaining the commission accepted that it would not be able 
to reach a compromise and began preparing separate majority and 
minority reports 
dean kleckner a republican member of the commission said 
tuesday that the majority report would call for reform of the budget 
process through steamlining the congressional budget committee 
granting the president lineitem veto authority of budget bills and 
recommending a constitutional amendment requiring balanced budgets 
he said the report would also recommend adoption of a twoyear 
budget process rather than the annual appropriation cycle now used 
the report reflects the will of taxpayers throughout the 
nation kleckner said in a statement testimony to the 
commission from 85 witnesses and more than 1300 responses from 
private citizens and groups this past 11 months clearly indicated 
opposition to higher taxes and irresponsible spending

rep larry combest rtexas issued a terse 
statement tuesday supporting defensesecretary designate john tower 
but refused to comment on a published report that he told senate 
armed services committee leaders that tower used to drink up to a 
bottle of scotch at a sitting 
an unidentified congressional source told the washington post 
that combests statement about towers drinking habits in the 1970s 
came down on sen sam nunn the committee chairman like a ton of 
bricks and was a factor in nunns opposition to the nomination 
the newspaper reported that combest later gave a different story 
to the fbi saying that tower and a group of friends not tower 
alone had frequently consumed a bottle of scotch 
after meeting with staff and advisers combest who worked for 
thensen tower in the 1970s issued a twosentence statement 
supporting his fellow texan 
as a member of congress i have tremendous respect and full 
confidence in the senator and his abilities to lead this countrys 
armed forces in my judgment john tower will be a superb secretary 
of defense the statement said 
combest spokesman rich adams refused to comment further and said 
combest was not available to speak to reporters 
the washington post reported that combest described for nunn and 
sen john w warner of virginia the ranking republican on the 
committee towers heavy drinking bouts in the 1970s a 
congressional source was quoted as saying that combest told the 
senators that tower would drink as much as a full bottle of scotch 
two or three times a week 
trudi boyd combests administrative assistant told the post 
that combest originally went to nunn and warner to tell them tower 
had ended his previous excessive abuse of alcohol 
boyd also told the post that a group of people drank the 
entire bottle of scotch not tower alone that was the account 
combest gave the fbi following his talk with nunn and warner the 
newspaper said it said that in that account combest said that he 
had only seen tower drunk on two or three occasions 
tower has acknowledged that he drank excessively in the 1970s 
but says he has reduced his intake to wine with dinner on sunday 
he promised to not drink a drop of alcohol if confirmed as defense 
secretary 
combest 43 worked for tower for seven years 19711978 as a 
legislative assistant handling agricultural legislation and policy

reelection in 1984 he was chairman of the senate armed services 
committee from 1981 through 1984

thousands of armenians marched in their capital of 
yerevan on tuesday to mark the first anniversary of ethnic riots in 
neighboring azerbaijan in which at least 26 armenians died local 
sources said 
an editor with armenpress the official armenian news agency put 
the number of marchers at 800000 which would be twothirds of 
yerevans population of 12 million there was no way to verify his 
estimate 
rem ananityan deputy director of armenpress said in a telephone 
interview that demonstrators carrying flowers gathered at a monument 
on a yerevan hillside commemorating victims of the 1915 massacre of 
armenians by turks 
demonstrations are banned in yerevan to reduce ethnic tensions 
but ananityan said military authorities there allowed tuesdays 
demonstration to take place he said no incidents were reported 
riots flared in sumgait azerbaijan on feb 28 1988 weeks 
after armenians began demonstrating for annexation of the 
nagornokarabakh region of azerbaijan where most residents are 
ethnic armenians 
soviet officials say 32 people 26 armenians and six 
azerbaijanis were killed but armenians insist the toll was much 
higher 
further violence broke out in armenia and azerbaijan last june 
july and november with more than 60 people killed in january the 
kremlin imposed direct rule on nagornokarabakh 
in an interview printed tuesday by the military daily krasnaya 
zvezda the kremlins special envoy to nagornokarabakh arkady 
volsky said tension there remains high 
mutual suspicion and mistrust persist while reproaches and 
accusations do not cease volsky told the newspaper according to 
a summary carried by the official tass news agency 
he said more than 200000 people from armenia and azerbaijan fled 
their homes because of the strife 
though populated largely by armenians who are traditionally 
christian nagornokarabakh was turned over by soviet officials in 
1923 to azerbaijan where most residents are moslems

sen sam nunns opposition to defense 
secretarydesignate john tower has focused new attention on a 1964 
incident in which a youthful nunn pleaded guilty to leaving the 
scene of a traffic accident 
the wall street journal in tuesdays editions reprinted a dec 4 
1972 article from the atlanta journal detailing the oct 31 1964 
automobile accident based on nunns account and the official 
accident report 
if the senate is entitled to pass judgment on john towers 
personal history the newspaper said in an editorial accompanying 
the 1972 article then the public is also entitled to know the 
salient facts about those who judge mr tower 
nunn dga is chairman of the senate armed services committee 
which voted 119 last week to reject towers nomination nunn and 
the other 10 democrats on the panel voted against tower 
according to police reports on the 1964 accident nunn had left a 
halloween party in his hometown of perry ga about 245 am when 
he swerved off the road and hit a parked car then drove several 
more blocks before going off the road and down an embankment 
nunn was charged with hit and run and leaving the scene of an 
accident court records show he later forfeited a 11550 bond on 
the single charge of leaving the scene of an accident 
nunn who has based his opposition to towers nomination in part 
on allegations that tower has a drinking problem acknowledged in a 
statement released by his office tuesday that he had too much to 
drink himself on the night of the accident 24 years ago 
that evening i had enough to drink so that both my driving and 
judgment were impaired nunn 50 said in the statement i pled 
guilty to leaving the scene paid my fine apologized to all 
concerned and at the age of 26 learned a valuable lesson which i 
have not forgotten 
nunn repeated that statement later tuesday in interviews with 
atlanta television stations and said he does not believe the 
accident is relevant to the issue of the tower nomination 
the implication is that if i have an automobile accident in 
1964 then im not qualified under the constitution to render advice 
and consent in 1989 nunn said i dont think that logic holds 
i dont know that that is relevant to this but i guess when 
youre in this kind of fight everything is fair game he said

the senate foreign relations committee on 
tuesday urged the bush administration to reassess future aid for 
sudan unless the government of the northern african nation improves 
food deliveries to millions of hungry sudanese 
in a resolution adopted by the panel and referred to the full 
senate the committee said another condition for aid should be 
progress in negotiating a ceasefire with the rebel sudan peoples 
liberation army to end nearly six years of civil war 
the sudanese army last week was reported to have given prime 
minister sadeq mahdi a oneweek ultimatum either to resign or begin 
peace talks with the rebels 
the senate resolution and a similar one being introduced 
thursday in the house also calls on the administration to 
cooperate with the soviet union in pressing the sudanese government 
and the rebels to settle their war 
state department officials say the united states has discussed 
the sudan crisis with the soviets but has not decided on joint 
action 
the resolution calls on president bush to appoint a special envoy 
to deal with sudan 
the bush administration has put special emphasis on resolving the 
sudan problem with secretary of state james baker issuing an urgent 
call several weeks ago to the sudanese government to allow foreign 
relief shipments into famine areas 
the united states and international relief agencies estimate that 
some 2 million southerners are in dire need of food and that more 
than 500000 died in 1988 from hunger 
us officials attribute the obstruction and delays of 
international food deliveries to the fighting to spla and 
government restrictions and to government inefficiency rebel 
leaders have accused the government of withholding food from the 
south as a form of genocide 
the senate resolution called on both the spla and the government 
to refrain from using food as a weapon 
the administration has asked congress for 51 million for sudan 
in fiscal 1990 45 million of it in economic and development aid 
and 6 million for military projects us aid to the sudan has been 
dropping steadily in recent years as the coalition government has 
lost some of its prowestern orientation under the influence of a 
strong faction of moslem fundamentalists

the national assembly took up a bill 
tuesday that would pardon nearly 2000 soldiers of the former somoza 
regime to comply with agreements made at a central american summit 
feb 14 
assembly president carlos nunez said the leftist sandinista 
government also would ask the legislature to pardon 800 jailed 
sandinista army soldiers that appeared aimed at mollifying 
government supporters angered at the proposal to release men who 
served the late president anastasio somoza 
of the 1932 on the list submitted to the assembly tuesday 1688 
are in prison and the rest under house arrest or free on probation 
they were members of the national guard as the army was called 
under somoza whose prous government the sandinistas overthrew in 
july 1979 
passage of the amnesty bill is assured because the sandinistas 
have 61 seats in the 96member assembly to 35 for all opposition 
parties 
release of the political prisoners is stipulated in the 
agreements reached at the summit by president daniel ortega and the 
presidents of el salvador honduras costa rica and guatemala 
they also agreed to draft a plan within 90 days to dismantle 
rebel forces supported by the united states about 10000 rebels or 
contras and 11000 family members live in camps in honduras near 
the nicaraguan border 
in a national assembly debate tuesday before the amnesty bill 
was sent to committee a member said the pardon and release should 
coincide with the end of the contra organization 
otherwise we would be letting out 1000 national guardsmen 
who could quickly form a military force in exchange for a simple 
promise to disarm and relocate the contras said carlos cuadra of 
the opposition marxistleninist popular action movement 
the assembly president one of nine members in the sandinista 
national directorate urged the committee reviewing the bill to 
report by march but did not specify a date neither did he say when 
the request to pardon the 800 jailed sandinistas was expected 
ortega is anxious to comply with the summit agreements because he 
seeks financial aid particularly from the 12nation european 
economic community several ambassadors from eec nations have said 
publicly and privately that further aid depends on increased 
democracy in nicaragua 
foreign minister miguel descoto is attending a meeting of common 
market and latin american foreign ministers in honduras to discuss 
european economic aid to the region 
since washington cut off aid and imposed a trade embargo in 1985 
nicaragua has depended on help from the soviet bloc and western 
europe a new us government report estimates soviet assistance at 
about 500 million a year 
nicaraguas economy is a shambles inflation surpassed 20000 
percent in 1988 and the cost of living increased by 97 percent in 
january a government austerity plan calls 30000 layoffs and 
tighter credit

two bookstores that sold all their copies 
of the satanic verses were damaged by firebombs tuesday and the 
offices of a new york newspaper that recently defended the book were 
wrecked in an explosion 
authorities in both cities said they werent sure the bombings 
had any connection to the controversial novel by salman rushdie but 
the owner of codys books in berkeley said he had little doubt 
i cant imagine any other reason why people would be lobbing 
bombs through bookstores codys or anyones said andy ross 
molotov cocktails were thrown through the windows of codys a 
berkeley institution that helped nurture the free speech movement in 
the 1960s and a berkeley outlet of the waldenbooks chain neither 
store was badly damaged 
a firebomb seriously damaged the offices of the riverdale press 
a weekly newspaper in the bronx that published an editorial last 
week defending the satanic verses 
the novel has outraged moslems throughout the world and prompted 
irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini to issue a death order for 
rushdie and the books publishers 
new york fire marshals said there was street talk that the 
bombing was retaliation for the editorial in the press which has a 
reputation for feistiness and has twice been nominated for pulitzer 
prizes for its editorials 
richard stein copublisher of the 14000circulation weekly 
said he guessed the bombing had something to do with something 
that was printed in the paper but i dont know what 
connecting it to the editorial about rushdie is nothing but 
speculation he said we have not received any telephone or 
written threats no one has taken credit for this 
similarly the manager of the berkeley waldenbooks bob gammon 
said he wasnt ready to attribute the attack on his store to the 
book 
the berkeley bombings were reported to police at 428 am one 
man brett rideout 44 told officers he was sleeping in his van 
outside codys when he heard crashing glass and a car roar away 
a bomb squad detonated one unexploded pipebomb found inside the 
store 
damage at codys was limited to broken glass a few scorched book 
shelves and some damaged books ross said he planned to leave a 
charred end case in place for a while as a reminder of the incident 
at waldenbooks a plate glass window was broken and a large 
circle was burned in the carpet about five feet from the hole 
ross estimated damage to his store at a few thousand dollars 
while a glass repairman at waldenbooks said replacing the broken 
window and glass would run close to 1000 
codys which is on telegraph avenue about a block from peoples 
park is a local landmark original owner fred cody designed the 
store with a corner setback to allow free speech demonstrators in 
the 1960s to speak there without being cited for trespassing on a 
public street 
bookstores throughout the country have been threatened if they 
carry the book but tuesdays bombings were the first in the united 
states since the furor arose over the satanic verses 
ive taken the threats very seriously said ross who said he 
nevertheless wont cancel his order for a new shipment of the 
satanic verses 
gammon said waldenbooks also had no plan to halt its order for 
the book although he might if he received threats or feared for 
public safety the book sold out the day after the khomeinis 
threat he said 
immediately following the threat waldenbooks the nations 
largest bookstore chain ordered the satanic verses removed from 
display nationwide the chain later said the decision on displaying 
the book would be up to individual store managers 
the firebombing of a bookstore is a very serious first 
amendment issue berkeley mayor loni hancock said tuesday we 
will take every step possible to protect and defend the safety and 
constitutional rights of berkeleys booksellers and book customers 
new york mayor edward i koch who went to the scene of the 
newspaper bombing announced a 10000 reward for help in finding 
and convicting the bomber 
stein said the papers insurance adjuster had not yet estimated 
the damage to the building which the press owns the fire 
department described the damage as heavy on the first floor and 
moderate on the second

a district of columbia judge rejected 
dissenting theologian charles currans suit against catholic 
university of america on tuesday ruling the school was within its 
rights in barring him from teaching theology there 
judge frederick weisberg said that in a struggle between academic 
freedom and obedience to pope john paul ii the university may 
choose for itself on which side of that conflict it wants to come 
down 
curran a priest strongly criticized by vatican officials for his 
positions on abortion homosexuality and other matters of sexual 
ethics had argued in court that the school breached his contract by 
removing him from the moral theology courses he had taught for years 
he sought full reinstatement in his lawsuit in superior court 
maintaining the university violated his contract as a tenured 
professor 
in a written decision the judge said it is apparent that this 
dispute is merely a piece of the larger struggle that has been 
raging in catholic higher education for many years that struggle 
seeks to establish the proper role of academic freedom within an 
american catholic university 
curran said he would not appeal 
i have fought for academic freedom at catholic university for 
more than 20 years he said in a statement distributed by his 
lawyers i have lost as far as i am concerned this was the last 
battle 
later in a telephone interview he said i think that catholic 
university was on trial more than i was i think the judge was 
wrong 
university officials said they felt vindicated 
it doesnt surprise me to tell you the truth said the rev 
william byron president of the school this is really what i 
expected because we never breached his contract 
curran who had taught at catholic university since 1965 was 
suspended in early 1987 and was formally told last year that he 
could not return as a theology teacher since his departure he has 
taught as a visiting professor at cornell university and then at the 
university of southern california 
catholic universitys action against him followed a vatican 
declaration that he was no longer suitable or eligible to teach 
catholic theology because of his dissenting views 
curran testified during his sevenday trial in december that 
under principles of academic freedom prevailing at american 
universities a tenured faculty member may be removed from his post 
only if his colleagues believe he is incompetent 
university officials testified that their action was proper under 
the schools special relationship with the vatican 
the catholic church requires theology professors at the school to 
have special authorization called a canonical mission cardinal 
james a hickey chancellor of the school testified the schools 
board of trustees withdrew currans canonical mission last april 
curran contended the canonical mission requirement had fallen 
into disuse in the 1960s when he joined the schools faculty he 
argued that he had never had a canonical mission so it could not be 
taken away curran also said a 1981 church rule making canonical 
missions mandatory did not apply to him because it wasnt in effect 
when he joined the faculty 
hickey said that although the requirement was not spelled out in 
church documents in the 1960s it was implicit 
curran said during the trial he wanted to prove that in the 
last analysis academic freedom itself is for the good of the 
church 
but weisberg said in his ruling what is good for catholic 
university or for the roman catholic church is not a question 
presented and not one the court has either the right or the 
competence to decide the question presented is whether his contract 
gives him the right to teach catholic theology at catholic 
university in the face of a definitive judgment from the holy see 
that he is ineligible to do so 
the court holds today that it does not

sixtynine illegal aliens were arrested as 
they prepared to board the same eastern airlines flight that 
immigration agents had raided on its previous trip snaring 79 
illegal aliens authorities said tuesday 
in the second sweep at los angeles international airport monday 
night agents also nabbed a mexican they described as a principal in 
the alleged smuggling operation the man whom police did not 
identify was arrested for investigation of transporting illegal 
aliens 
the first sweep had been at hartsfield atlanta international 
airport early monday after easterns flight 80 en route to new york 
from los angeles touched down for a stopover 
us immigration and naturalization service officials stressed 
that several independent smugglers may have used easterns flight 80 
and that the group arrested in los angeles was not necessarily 
linked to people seized in atlanta they also said the chief 
smuggling operators remain at large 
we feel like we have a number of individual smugglers who are 
utilizing a rather low airfare to move their aliens away from the 
border from los angeles and on up to the east coast said thomas 
gaines assistant western district director for the ins 
at a news conference at the ins los angeles office gaines 
speculated that the alleged smuggling operation may have gone ahead 
monday despite the arrests in atlanta because the tickets had 
already been bought 
in atlanta the illegal aliens said they paid as much as 4000 
as part of a package deal to help start a new life in new york 
of those seized at the los angeles airports terminal six 54 
were from mexico seven were from el salvador four were from 
colombia and four were from guatemala said los angeles ins acting 
district director donald looney 
ins spokesman joe flanders said most of the people if found to 
be illegal aliens would be given the choice of going home or 
requesting a deportation hearing flanders said some might be held 
as material witnesses 
one alien seized in atlanta juan de la cruzrodriguez 34 said 
he had come to the united states to earn some money to send to his 
wife and three young sons in the dominican republic he told the 
atlanta journal a smuggler in mexico helped him and a dozen others 
cross the border then arranged to have them transported by flatbed 
truck to los angeles 
he said he sold his truck to raise part of the money and gave the 
smuggler almost 1000 holding up a quarter he said thats all 
i have left 
gaines said the arrests at the los angeles airport resulted from 
tips but said the operation was not coordinated with the atlanta 
sweep 
tom thomas a spokesman for the ins in atlanta said thousands of 
illegal aliens may have been shuttled across the country on the 
daily eastern airlines flight from los angeles to new york he said 
flight 80 might have been popular because no transfers were involved 
and rates might have been cheaper 
gaines refused to speculate on how many people may have used the 
flights but said the technique is not new recalling at least one 
sweep in recent years that netted 200 people 
both thomas in atlanta and looney in los angeles said eastern 
airlines was not connected with the investigation

two senators introduced legislation tuesday 
that would ban the use of the mails to distribute athletic 
performanceenhancing steroids 
the use of these potentially lifethreatening drugs is one of 
the most serious problems facing our nation today sen strom 
thurmond rsc said in a statement issued by his office 
the bill cosponsored by sen joseph r biden jr ddel would 
make it a crime punishable by three years in prison to use the 
mails to distribute anabolic steroids drugs used by some athletes 
to enhance performance 
use of the mails to solicit sales of steroids also would become a 
criminal offense under the legislation 
congress last year banned steroid distribution but authorities 
say some dealers particularly in mexico and europe are using the 
mails and telephone solicitation to get steroids to users 
the latest legislation would enable postal inspectors to join the 
battle

two top iranian leaders on tuesday denied 
iranian dissidents were executed after rebels of the iraqibased 
mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors pushed into the country 
last summer 
iranian interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi had been quoted 
earlier as telling the parisbased almostaqbal weekly that all 
those were captured or those who joined them were executed 
they had declared war against the people they killed and 
got killed montashemi was quoted as saying any group or people 
that raises arms and kills people deserves to be executed 
but irans official islamic republic news agency quoted 
montashemi as saying tuesday in tehran that he had not made the 
statements but merely said that a large number of rebels were 
killed when they thrust into western iran in august 
irna quoted mohtashemi as saying the almostaqbal report was a 
product of the reporters imaginings in fact the issue of 
prisoners was not brought up in the interview at all 
in paris iranian parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani denied 
there were mass executions of iranian rebel fighters but said that 
up to 5000 were killed in a battle on the warfront following the 
ceasefire with iraq 
in an interview on french tv rafsanjani said only certain 
jailed opponents had been killed 
we have discovered that certain imprisoned hypocrites in iran 
were in contact with their fighting friends in iraq rafsanjani 
said in reference to the rebels we killed them but there 
certainly were not 1000 any competent jurisdiction can easily

slowly but surely voters filed into serbian hall 
tuesday most of them taking republican ballots in a precinct where 
democrats once were royal and the local prince was an alderman named 
edward vrdolyak 
a republican now vrdolyak has lost two consecutive political 
bids and his comeback effort as a writein candidate for the gop 
mayoral nomination led a chicago tribune editorialist to label him 
the count dracula of chicago politics 
vrdolyak who represented this southeast side ward of heavy 
industry and workingclass neighborhoods for 16 years as a democrat 
launched his latest bid less than a week ago 
and in the neat woodandbrick community hall on the grounds of 
st simeon serbian orthodox church it looked like things were going 
his way 
were going to get several thousand votes thanks to a lot of 
our people supporting me vrdolyak said shaking hands with a few 
supporters at the hall and to those that arent i apologize for 
getting into the race late after they have already made commitments 
but well get em next time 
the 10th ward with its primarily white ethnic constituency has 
been loyal to vrdolyak a former cook county democratic party 
chairman some voters say thats because vrdolyak has been loyal to 
them 
all the mayoral candidates talk about fighting crime and 
promoting education but top democratic contenders richard m daley 
or mayor eugene sawyer cannot get the job done said creita sadzak 
54 who wrote vrdolyak in tuesday 
if eddie gets in then eddie is going to do it she said 
its not fast eddie any more she said referring to the moniker 
hung on vrdolyak for years its ready eddie 
the gop endorsed herbert sohn a doctor and attorney who has made 
three unsuccessful bids for congress 
whichever republican is on the april 4 general election ballot 
the prospects do not look good 
republicans in this traditionally democratic city havent found 
their way into the mayors office since the 1930s 
voting for vrdolyak required writing the words mayor and 
vrdolyak and putting an x in a box which political analysts 
predicted would be too difficult for some people 
vrdolyak who lost his gop bid for circuit court clerk last fall 
countered that the thousands of pieces of instructional literature 
sent to likely backers would help him get enough votes to beat sohn 
vrdolyak cast his own ballot earlier in the day at st simeon 
which sits on a carefully manicured lot among bungelows in the 
shadows of an industrial complex 
one of the first people voters encountered at the hall was gop 
election judge patricia hansen 53 who said she was republican even 
before vrdolyaks switch 
i always said why should i be lost among the many when i can 
stand out among the few she said i was considered a prominent 
republican 
now im lost among the many

drug use among high school seniors last year 
dropped to its lowest level since 1975 said an annual survey 
released tuesday still more than half of all students use an 
illegal drug at least once before graduating 
researchers and health officials said they were particularly 
encouraged by results showing the second straight significant drop 
in cocaine use and the beginnings of a retreat in use of the 
smokeable and highly addictive form of cocaine called crack 
the news is very encouraging said charles r schuster 
director of the national institute on drug abuse which sponsored 
the study but we dont want to imply that the war is won 
the problem is there are still pockets primarily among those 
who have dropped out of high school where drug use remains at very 
high levels he said 
the continued decline in drug use suggests that antidrug 
campaigns educating the young about the hazards of drug use are 
being heard said lloyd johnston a university of michigan social 
psychologist and codirector of the study 
these important successes have been achieved not through supply 
reduction they are due almost entirely to a reduction in demand 
johnston said 
however he said the 15 percent of youth that drop out before 
completing high school present a troublesome issue because the 
crack problem is particularly concentrated in this population 
especially in the inner cities 
some 16300 high school seniors from 135 schools nationwide were 
polled in the survey johnston declined to identify the schools but 
he said they included public and private schools across the 
continental united states 
the survey which has been conducted by the university of 
michigans institute for social research every year since 1975 
found that the proportion of high school seniors who reported having 
ever used an illegal drug dropped from 566 percent in 1987 to 539 
percent in 1988 thats the lowest level recorded since the survey 
began when the rate was 552 percent 
peak illegal drug use occurred in 1981 when 656 percent of 
seniors reported having indulged at least once according to the 
survey 
the proportion of seniors who reported using an illegal drug 
within the previous year dropped from 417 percent in 1987 to 385 
percent in 1988 and the percentage reporting use within the 
previous 30 days dropped from 247 percent to 213 percent in the 
same period the survey showed 
although the use of marijuana has been declining since a peak of 
277 percent in the high school class of 1979 the 214 percent 
reported for last year was higher than the 19 percent reported in 
the first year of the survey 
one of the most striking figures schuster said is the drop 
in daily use of marijuana among seniors down from 11 percent in 
1979 to 27 percent last year 
the proportion of seniors who have used cocaine at least once 
dropped from 15 percent in 1987 to 12 percent in 1988 and the 
proportion who said they had used cocaine at least once in the 
previous 30 days dropped from 43 percent in 1987 to 34 percent in 
1988 
we predicted such a decline in cocaine use would occur once 
young people began to see its use particularly experimental and 
occasional use as more risky and thats what now seems to be 
happening johnston said 
the survey found more than 89 percent of the class of 1988 
disapproved of even experimenting with cocaine up from 80 percent 
in 1986 
one troublesome statistic for researchers was that 40 percent of 
those who had tried cocaine also have used crack however the 
proportion of those who said they had used crack at least once 
dropped from 56 percent in 1987 to 48 percent last year 
besides marijuana and cocaine the survey tracked use of 
hallucinogens heroin sedatives tranquilizers stimulants and 
inhalants as well as alcohol and cigarettes 
alcohol is by far the most widely use of the substances with 
nearly 64 percent of the seniors reporting that they had had a drink 
within the previous 30 days cigarettes were next with nearly 29 
percent having smoked within the previous month and 18 percent 
reporting they were daily smokers 
the survey also showed some regional variations in drug use 
cocaine use was highest in the west 12 percent and the east 9 
percent compared with about 6 percent in the rest of the country 
crack use was also highest in the west 56 percent compared with 
27 percent in the south and about 23 percent in the rest of the 
country 
for most drugs use was higher among boys however use of 
stimulants and tranquilizers was slightly more prevalent among 
girls however

amnesty international on tuesday accused iraq of 
torturing children including some infants to extract information 
or executing them to punish their parents 
in a 33page report entitled children innocent victims of 
political repression the international human rights group said 
children held by iraqi authorities are routinely tortured by 
beatings whippings sexual abuse and electric shock 
it said the aim is often to force them to reveal information 
about their relatives in sum children and young people have 
become the innocent victims of a policy of political repression 
opponents and critics of the government have frequently had to 
pay a price for their activities in terms of the welfare and 
sometimes the lives of their children it said 
amnesty appealed to iraq to stop the reported brutality and said 
it asked the un commission for human rights meeting in geneva to 
investigate 
amnesty also devoted its march newsletter focus which 
became available tuesday to the problem it details the cases of 
iraqi children allegedly mistreated from about 1983 to 1988 
in one case a former political prisoner released in 1985 after 
five months detention at alkarkh security directorate told of the 
abuse of his family in prison 
my mother aged 73 three sisters and three brothers with 
five children aged between five and 13 were arrested and brought in 
front of me then beaten on the soles of their feet the prisoner 
who was not identified was quoted as saying 
amnesty said he added usually they keep children in a separate 
cell next to the mothers or fathers cell and deprive them of milk 
in order to force the parents to confess i saw a 5monthold baby 
screaming in this state 
the human rights group said children have been lined up and 
summarily shot in public and others have been shot to death in 
demonstrations in a series of killings of children by government 
forces 
the fingernails of abd rahman ahmad haji 17 were pulled out 
before his execution in abu ghraib prison in 1985 it said 
other incidents reported by the independent londonbased group 
include 
the repeated breach in spring 1987 of iraqi law prohibiting the 
death penalty in cases involving people under 18 years of age it 
said that among those teenagers killed were a number of supposed 
supporters of the outlawed kurdistan democratic party 
the killing of 15 secondary school and university students in 
spring 1986 in retaliation for an assassination attempt reportedly 
by kurds on a governor in the abril region 
other children have simply disappeared amnesty said 
it said that in 1983 315 children some as young as eight were 
among 8000 male members of the kurdish barzani community who 
disappeared after the communitys forced resettlement 
the government killed about 8000 members of the kurdish minority 
in 1988 according to the us state department it has also been 
accused of a deliberate policy to depopulate kurdish regions with 
poison gas attacks 
kurdish rebels fought the central government for autonomy during 
the eightyear iraqiran war

oliver norths irancontra trial ground to a 
halt and was thrown into confusion tuesday by documents introduced 
in court as classified but made available in uncensored versions to 
a private activist group 
north lawyer brendan sullivan asked the judge to throw out all 12 
criminal charges in the case asserting prosecutors were guilty of 
a fraud on the defense 
us district judge gerhard a gesell said he was not trying to 
look for sanctions against anyone but was concerned about 
getting to the bottom of whats going on regarding the use of 
classified information at the trial 
my concern is whether this presents an example of looseness in 
governmental dealings with this problem of classified information 
the judge said during a lengthy afternoon hearing he wondered aloud 
whether all the pretrial work on rules for handling such information 
would have to be done over 
he said declaring a mistrial and starting over with a new jury 
was out of the question 
the new stumbling block was the discovery that 10 memos 
introduced in the trial with names and other information blacked out 
had long ago been turned over uncensored to the christic institute 
in connection with a lawsuit filed several years ago by the group 
against north and several other people the institute is strongly 
opposed to administration policy in central america 
the memos had been written by robert owen to north during a 
twoyear period when owen acted as a courier between north and 
rebels fighting the government in nicaragua 
with the issue far from settled and creating unforeseen 
implications for other classified material the judge ordered that 
the jury return wednesday morning sullivan had asked for another 
day to argue out of the jurys hearing saying im not sure what 
the rules are 
but gesell said the longer the jury is not in that box the 
more difficult it is to revivify the case i get very very worried 
about hauling citizens into the jury box all the time and not give 
them anything to do 
during the threehour hearing chief trial prosecutor john keker 
disclosed that an interagency intelligence group had decided 
tuesday morning that it would no longer regard the owen memos as 
classified the same group had censored the documents in the first 
place after they had been turned over to christic by thomas 
hylden owens lawyer 
called to the witness stand hylden said that at a conference 
with prosecutors on feb 10 he noticed they were working from a 
censored version of one memo and remarked that his copy was uncut 
and that he had given a copy to the christic institute 
michael bromwich a member of the prosecution team who was at 
that conference said he called in security expert allen stansbury 
who told him he would retrieve christics copy but bromwich said he 
then forgot about the matter until the defense raised it late monday 
night 
stansbury the security director of the independent counsels 
office said he contacted the justice department about the owen 
memos having gone to a litigant in florida which he now knows is 
the christic institute he said he thought of trying to retrieve the 
documents but wanted to check further with justice department 
superiors before doing anything 
bromwich said it was his understanding that a document could be 
classified even though it was in the public domain already 
for 2 12 weeks a jury has been ready to try this case and 
hasnt been able to try it said gesell now i hear we are 
dealing with classified documents that can be classified ex post 
facto 
amid the discussion over government secrets gesell sent the jury 
home early on friday again after the noon recess on monday and at 
the start of the day tuesday 
gesell noted that he had a continuing motion from the defense 
relating to whether or not a fair trial can be given under rules 
set by a law governing disclosure of state secrets at trial 
the government is simply unable to manage the classified 
information at issue here in a manner that permits a fair trial 
sullivan said tuesday in a motion filed with the court 
instead of revealing the critical fact that the memos had 
been made available in uncensored form he said the independent 
counsel hid it and incredibly insisted that the court and the 
defense treat these alreadypublic documents as classified 
although the dispute went to the heart of the secrecy issues 
woven through the fabric of the trial the specific issue was 
mention of the name of a high costa rican official former security 
minister benjamin piza it was blacked out in the court document 
but was on the public record in the christic suit 
later tuesday the christic institute which strongly opposes 
us government policy in central america released the documents 
in the aug 25 1985 memo central to the dispute the fact that it 
concerned a meeting with ben and johnny had been censored in the 
version at the trial to read costa rican officials ben 
apparently was piza johnny apparently john campos the words 
another costa rican official masked a colonel in the civil 
guard col jose ramon mendero quesada 
north a retired marine lieutenant colonel faces 12 felony 
charges including allegations he lied to lawmakers to cover up his 
secret efforts to help the contras when such assistance was banned 
by congress

irish government officials say they will 
boycott the citys st patricks day parade because the grand 
marshal is the local leader of an organization that supports the 
outlawed irish republican army 
parade organizers said the grand marshal was elected by a 
crosssection of the citys large irish community and the 
controversy would not dim their celebration 
irish consulgeneral brian nason said neither he nor the lord 
mayor of cork san franciscos sister city will attend or 
participate in the parade 
it would be like going to a party with the ira nason said of 
standing on the reviewing platform with grand marshal dan mccormick 
on march 12 
for years irish government representatives have turned their 
backs or stepped off the reviewing stand when parade units of irish 
northern aid pass by mccormick is president of the local chapter of 
the irish northern aid a national organization dedicated to 
supporting the ira 
controversy erupted in new york city several years ago when 
michael flannery of irish northern aid served as grand marshal of 
that citys parade the biggest st patricks day parade in the 
united states 
this will be the first year that officials refuse to attend san 
franciscos parade 
despite nasons declaration parade officials are determined to 
carry on with their plans 
i have no intention whatsoever of making any changes said 
parade chairman denis guiney let the parade continue as it is 
i do not like politics in the parade under no circumstances will 
i be a party to the removal of the grand marshal 
similarly a spokeswoman for mayor art agnos said agnos still 
plans to ride in the parade 
as far as i know at this time its on his schedule to do 
said spokeswoman eileen maloney calling nasons boycott serious 
protocol for them but i dont know what it means to us 
generally in san franciscos parades a broad spectrum of 
political opinion is not unusual maloney said 
the irish republican army is an outlawed predominantly roman 
catholic guerrilla group that has been fighting for more than 20 
years to end british rule in northern ireland and unite the 
protestantdominated province with the irish republic but 
protestants in northern ireland who outnumber catholics in the 
region oppose unity with the irish republic which is 
overwhelmingly roman catholic 
mccormick was elected grand marshal by a 2to1 margin by the 
united irish societies a group of about 30 local irish civic and 
cultural organizations 
vivian mcdonagh executive editor of the irishman newspaper an 
independent monthly publication defended mccormick as more than a 
leader of the irish northern aid she noted that he is a member of a 
fife and drum corps and a former plumbers union official who helped 
numerous irish immigrants land jobs

state medicaid will pay for a bonemarrow 
transplant that could save a 6yearold boys life gov judd gregg 
said tuesday as he tried to defuse embarrassing reports that the 
state wouldnt pay 
this is not a new policy gregg said at a statehouse news 
conference called to clarify the states position on paying for 
derek anneses transplant reports to the contrary were the result 
of a communications breakdown he said 
greggs assurances apparently silenced the public outcry but not 
the disagreement that arose when the boys doctor and lawyer were 
told it would take private donations to foot the bill 
boston globe reporter bob hohler said he stood by last sundays 
story that became the subject of talk shows and a donation drive 
hohler said he discussed the case with several state officials 
including health and human services commissioner mary mongan gregg 
spokesman brian grip and state medicaid director phil soule 
none of them said the operation was covered hohler said 
and soule said it wasnt covered and when i asked him who changed 
the rules two years ago to drop coverage he told me i guess i 
did 
but gregg said the globe story was inappropriate in its 
representation of the states position 
speaking directly to hohler at the news conference gregg said 
i cant say that you are correctly reflecting soules comments 
gregg indicated that the confusion might have resulted because 
the state covers indirect costs associated with a transplant but 
not the actual surgery 
ron eskin a new hampshire legal assistance lawyer representing 
the boy said there was no breakdown in communication 
i regard that the governors statement as a total reversal of 
his position and thats great he said im not criticizing the 
governor im just saying were not all crazy out here 
soule was on vacation and could not be reached for comment 
tuesday 
the boy and his mother also could not be reached they were 
concluding a vacation at disneyworld in florida 
doctors say derek who lives with his mother and two brothers in 
nashua on about 800 a month on public assistance needs the 
transplant to stay alive 
about 150000 is needed to pay for the operation 
hospitalization and other expenses according to the globe 
gregg said the state waited until tuesday to go public on the 
matter until we could get all the numbers 
he said the states medicaid money will take care of more than 
100000 for hospitalization and other costs other than the surgery 
the surgery will cost between 10000 and 25000 gregg said 
adding that he and the executive council will use discretionary 
funds to help pay some of that amount

british church leaders on tuesday urged the 
conservative government to adopt a tough policy against south 
africa including an immediate ban on air links 
in a report released tuesday the leaders said britain is 
encouraging south africa to believe change is not urgent 
apartheid will simply reform adapt and survive it said to 
britains policy of mild diplomatic pressure and waiting for 
economic growth 
the report was drawn up by the british council of churches the 
main representative body of christian churches in britain and a 
voluntary organization christian aid 
british exports to south africa official figures show rose by 
nearly 20 percent to 14 billion in the first nine months of last 
year compared with the same period in 1987 
britain is south africas thirdlargest trading partner behind 
japan and west germany 
the report said prime minister margaret thatchers government 
largely stuck to the letter of 15 relatively mild sanctions 
ranging from a longtime ban on arms sales to a voluntary ban on 
promoting tourism but not the spirit 
the message brought home to the south african government is not 
that change is urgently needed but that britain regards these 
measures lightly said the report 
mrs thatcher argues her policy increased british influence for 
change in south africa she says sanctions would hurt south african 
blacks most harden white resistance to change be circumvented and 
cost jobs in britain 
the church report said the british government encouraged trade 
with south africa 
there have been computer and radar sales which could be of use 
to the military it said 
the voluntary ban on the promotion of tourism agreed in 
mid1986 appears to have been carried out only through the dispatch 
of two letters to tourist federations and is not monitored by the 
government 
british airways heavily advertises its south african flights 
including a link to the united states of america which replaces the 
direct flights banned by the us congress

truth said rodney thompson a county commissioner from hollywood 
md it would have ramifications down the road which would be hard 
to swallow 
james ross dover representing hollywood in northeast georgia a 
rural town that dates back to 1807 was agitated by what he called

actually a neighborhood within the city of los angeles 
my hearts aching from the anxiety thats being caused dover 
said lets kindle the fire a little bit hotter because im hot 
mara giulianti mayor of this seaside city of 125000 organized 
the protest after winning a 30day extension on review of 
californias trademark application which was proposed in 1986

my vibes and the nature of the committees questions which he 
said went over old ground

meeting derwinski said im perfectly confident that as a 
result of this meeting my confirmation is coming along nicely i 
dont see anything as a result of this meeting detrimental or 
negative 
derwinskis optimism was shared by the committees senior

consumers didnt like them so rj reynolds 
tobacco co is withdrawing its premier brand smokeless 
cigarettes after five months on market testing 
industry analysts speculated that rjr spent 200 million to 325 
million to develop and launch premier while the aborted national 
rollout of the product would have increased the cost to about 1 
billion 
the company said tuesday in a statement that while smokers are 
very interested in the concept the current product has not achieved 
adequate consumer acceptance 
the two primary areas that the test showed us we have to work 
on is taste and the aroma company spokesman david fishel said 
all i can say for competitive reasons is that we learned a lot in 
the test marketing that we will be able to use later on 
rj reynolds had testmarketed premier in arizona and eastern 
missouri 
theyre terrible theyre nasty theyre beyond nasty mark 
padgett an employee at a 711 store in phoenix said shortly after 
the cigarette hit the market in october 
premier was advertised as the cleaner smoke because the 
company said it substantially reduced certain compounds found in 
the smoke of tobaccoburning cigarettes and virtually eliminated 
cigarette ashes and smoke 
several health organizations including the american medical 
association asked the food and drug admininstration to ban sale of 
the cigarette the ama said premier was a drugdelivery device not 
a cigarette 
the cigarette works by heating instead of burning tobacco 
smokers light a carbon heat source at the cigarettes tip during 
inhalation air is heated by the smoldering carbon and passed over 
an aluminumencased flavor capsule 
we are pleased to see rj reynolds withdrawing premier from 
the market dr james h sammons executive vice president of the 
ama said in a statement tuesday he said the ama would continue to 
pursue its request with the fda which has not issued a ruling yet 
this probably makes that a moot petition said bill grigg a 
spokesman for te fda in washington grigg said fda lawyers would 
have to review the situation 
last year reynolds refused a request from the arizona board of 
pharmacy to voluntarily withdraw the cigarette 
reynolds said tuesday that it had no plans to reintroduce premier 
or a similar product unless we have fully addressed the issues 
raised in the test markets 
fishel said the company had used small groups to test premier 
before moving into the twostate test markets asked if the results 
of the testmarketing differed from the reaction of small groups 
fishel said i think thats a safe statement 
reynolds major cigarette brands are winston salem camel 
vantage doral century more now and ritz

the rightwing likud bloc scored major upsets 
over the leftleaning labor party tuesday in nationwide municipal 
elections billed by likud as a referendum on the arabisraeli 
conflict initial results indicated 
in the key race in jerusalem prolabor mayor teddy kollek was 
reelected to a sixth term but failed to win a majority in the city 
council as religious parties doubled their representation 
throughout the country ultraorthodox parties scored gains 
repeating their success of the november parliamentary elections 
in israels arab sector moslem fundamentalists ousted the 
communist leadership of the secondlargest city umm el fahm 
sparking fears that antiisraeli sentiments are spreading among 
israeli arabs 
palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip were barred 
from entering israel tuesday as an election security measure police 
said in clashes in the occupied lands israeli troops fatally shot 
a 25yearold palestinian and wounded four others according to the 
army and arab doctors 
the death brought to 387 the number of palestinians killed in the 
14monthold uprising seventeen israelis have also been killed 
with about 43 percent of the vote counted likud appeared to have 
won in several labor strongholds including the southern port city 
of ashdod and the city of beer sheba in the negev desert 
about 48 percent of israels 27 million voters went to the 
polls down from 55 percent in 1983 as many israelis spent the 
sunny day on beaches and in parks instead of casting their votes 
at stake were 147 races for local council and mayor in 1983 
labor won in 54 towns compared to 26 taken by likud the remainder 
went to local slates or religious parties 
labor leader shimon peres finance minister appeared 
disappointed there is always a place for soul searching well do 
it after we know the final results he said on israel army radio 
labor leaders had insisted that only local not national issues 
were at stake in the vote but a sweeping defeat would further 
accelerate labors decline as a national political force labor 
once the dominant party in israel has failed to win in the past 
four national elections 
likud minister ronni milo claimed victory for his party and 
suggested that success on the local level further strengthened likud 
on the national level 
maybe this is an indication of where israeli politics are 
going milo minister for environmental protection said on army 
radio 
voters cast two ballots one for mayor and the second for a party 
slate 
in jerusalem kollek won 64 percent of the vote while his one 
jerusalem slate a labor affiliate received about 11 or 12 of 31 
council seats down from 17 in 1983 tv projections said 
religious parties more than doubled their votes from 89 percent 
in 1983 to 196 percent 
kollek reelected to his sixth term said he would try to govern 
with a minority in the council rather than form a coalition 
the results will not help the proper administration of the 
city the 77yearold kollek said on israel television 
kollek lost the majority in the council in part because of the 
boycott by east jerusalems 80000 arab voters traditionally kollek 
supporters fewer than 2 percent of the arabs went to the polls 
compared to 18 percent in 1983 
the boycott was ordered by the proplo leadership of the 
palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip the 
leaders called a general strike tuesday to enforce the order and 
urged palestinians to punish those ignoring the boycott 
i think each one of the over 3000 arabs who has voted is a 
hero and should be given a medal said kollek 
in tel aviv israels secondlargest city mayor shlomo lahat of 
likud won reelection to a fourth term with more than 50 percent of 
the vote religious parties in tel aviv increased their vote from 10 
percent in 1983 to 15 percent 
but lahat vowed that he would not succumb to demands by religious 
parties such as closing places of entertainment on the jewish 
sabbath 
in the port city of haifa a labor stronghold for decades mayor 
arieh gurel won 43 percent to narrowly defeat his likud challenger 
rami dotan 
the victory of the islamic movement in umm el fahm a city of 
more than 20000 in northern israel sparked concern among israeli 
leaders 
the islamic movement is a dangerous movement and this reflects 
what is happening in the middle east said uzi baram labors 
outgoing secretary general 
results from other arab towns were not yet available but in the 
past most have been run by communist or leftwing groups 
about 10000 police civil guardsmen and volunteers were posted 
at polling stations in case of violence 
police reported 152 electionrelated incidents most related to 
improper distribution of campaign material or ballot violations 
twentyfour people were arrested

israeli warplanes struck palestinian bases 
in the chouf mountains southeast of beirut tuesday killing two 
guerrillas and wounding 34 people including 26 children at a nearby 
elementary school police said 
panicked children aged 4 to 10 some with blood streaming down 
their faces ran screaming and sobbing from the school a teacher 
said a blackboard in one classroom still listed tuesdays subject 
for discussion the war 
five of the children were critically hurt when rockets exploded 
within 25 yards of their school only yards from a guerrilla base 
in addition eight other people were wounded in the raid on the 
bases by six fighterbombers 
the guerrilla casualties were members of the democratic front for 
the liberation of palestine a marxist group that is part of the 
palestine liberation organization said a police spokesman who 
cannot be identified under briefing rules 
five of the wounded were militiamen of the leftist druse 
progressive socialist party they were manning a post near ainab a 
mountain village 9 miles southeast of beirut 
the air strike coincided with the fronts 20th anniversary and 
came five days after the guerrilla group lost three fighters in an 
attack on israelibacked militiamen in south lebanon 
the spokesman said the israeli warplanes struck at 1128 am and 
also hit bases belonging to syrianbacked guerrilla factions near 
the druse villages of shemlan aitat and baysour 
the fighterbombers swooped down through clear skies for at least 
three bomb and rocket runs in what an israeli military spokesman in 
jerusalem said was a raid on a headquarters of the front 
palestinian druse and shiite moslem fighters fired antiaircraft 
guns at the raiders from positions in the mountains and around 
beirut airport but no hits were reported 
all our planes returned safely and the targets were 
destroyed the israeli spokesman said 
the children were wounded by shrapnel and glass shards when two 
rockets exploded within 25 yards of ainabs governmentsponsored 
elementary school on the second floor of a twostory house 
in one classroom the youngsters were discussing the war as part 
of tuesdays lesson when the jets screamed in an instructor said 
all of a sudden glass started spraying the room said teacher 
raja jaber who suffered head wounds there was panic everywhere 
the children started screaming as blood streamed down their faces 
one of them cried miss it hurts 
the treeringed guerrilla base a twostory stone house and two 
olivegreen tents took several direct hits 
suheil natour a spokesman for the front told the associated 
press the guerrilla faction will step up military strikes 
against israels occupation forces 
an israeli foreign ministry official said the fronts attack 
thursday was another example of the inability of the plo to 
fulfill its declared statement of stopping terror 
state department spokesman charles e redman said in washington 
that the thursday incident and israels air strike underscored a 
need for security arrangements to protect israelis and lebanese 
we deplore the loss of life and needless suffering of innocent 
people on both sides he said 
the us designated contact with the plo ambassador robert 
pelletreau criticized the thursday raid as having a negative impact 
on the 2monthold usplo dialogue and on prospects for 
israelpalestinian talks 
however redman said the state department is still examining 
whether the thursday raid showed plo chairman yasser arafat broke 
his promise in december not to engage in terrorism which led the 
united states to begin direct meetings with the plo 
the israelis have charged that guerrilla raids launched since 
then have undermined that declaration the plo says arafats 
renunciation of terrorism does not include halting attacks on 
military targets in israel or israelioccupied territory 
the israeli raid was the third on targets in lebanon this year 
by police count at least 128 people were killed and 356 wounded in 
25 israeli air raids on lebanon last year there were no casualties 
reported in the two raids earlier this year 
in beirut rival lebanese military forces on both sides of the 
dividing green line on tuesday reopened a crossing linking the 
christian and moslem sectors that was closed for five years 
pedestrians and motorists streamed across the port crossing which 
zigzags through the warravaged harbor area 
two other crossings in the center of beirut have long been choked 
by traffic and three other gateways in downtown beirut and its 
eastern suburbs remain closed

richard m daley jumped to an early lead tuesday 
as he sought to oust mayor eugene sawyer and capture the democratic 
nomination for the office held by his father for 21 years 
following a campaign that many observers found tame by chicagos 
raucous standards turnout in the primary election was lower than 
expected the chicago board of election commissioners said 
the lower turnout appeared to favor daley since early 
indications from an elections official who declined to be identified 
were that black turnout was running about 10 percentage points 
behind white voting 
daley jumped into the lead in very early returns from 
predominantly white wards on the citys southwest and northwest 
sides with 23 percent of the citys 2911 precincts reporting he 
had 122144 votes or 63 percent to sawyers 69348 votes or 36 
percent three other candidates divided the remaining votes 
the republican primary normally a nonevent in chicago politics 
was turned topsyturvy by former democratic alderman edward 
vrdolyaks lastminute writein campaign with 16 percent of the 
precincts reporting he had 1320 votes or 35 percent to the 
gopendorsed candidate herbert sohns 1748 votes or 47 percent 
but some precincts were not immediately reporting the writein 
votes businessmen william grutzmacher and kenneth hurst each had 9 
percent 
because of the difficulty of counting writein votes the outcome 
of the republican race might not be known before thursday 
adding further to the maneuvering the two primary winners will 
face a third opponent in the general election timothy evans a 
black alderman who is mounting a thirdparty bid on the harold 
washington party ticket 
sawyer needed heavy black turnout in order to duplicate the 
victories of the late harold washigton who became the citys first 
black mayor in 1983 and four years later the first since the elder 
daley to win reelection 
sawyer campaign manager reynard rochon said he was disappointed 
with the turnout 
in the last hour and a half of voting there was a surge in 
sawyer voters rochon said whether or not that surge came up 
high enough to offset the gap in the turnout between the white and 
black votes we dont know 
in both of washingtons primary victories black turnout was 75 
percent and 98 percent of those votes went to the late mayor 
daley 46 a threeterm cook county states attorney was making 
his second bid for the seat once occupied by his father richard j 
daley the legendary bigcity boss who died in office in 1976 
the younger daley lost his 1983 bid in the democratic primary to 
washington who died in office in 1987 
sawyer 54 who had been an alderman for 16 years was appointed 
acting mayor by a bitterly divided council a week after washington 
died 
a daley victory tuesday followed by another in the april 4 
general election would mark the first time a white has ousted a 
black mayor in one of the nations largest cities the winner of the 
general election will serve until 1991 
a newspaper poll a week ago had sawyer gaining on daley but still 
8 percentage points behind daley held a 7 percentage point lead in 
a late poll sponsored by a local newspaper and television station 
thirtyone of the citys 1406 polling places opened late in 
light snow but skies cleared and temperatures climbed into the 20s 
tuesday afternoon a circuit judge ordered the 31 locations to stay 
open an exta hour 
sawyer voted about 9 am near his south side home telling 
reporters im glad its finally over 
vrdolyak 51 voted about the same time at a church in his south 
side ward and daley cast his ballot about an hour later at a 
recreation center a block from his home saying im confident 
about today 
also on the democratic primary ballot were former state 
legislator james taylor 59 sheila jones 38 a disciple of jailed 
political extremist lyndon larouche and alderman lawrence bloom 
who withdrew too late to have his name removed from the ballot

more very young children die from murder than 
from any other category of injurycaused death according to a new 
study by researchers at johns hopkins university 
the study released tuesday says that from the years 1980 to 
1985 a total of 1250 children under one year of age died of 
homicide a finding that stunned researchers who compiled the 
report said anna e waller of the injury prevention center at johns 
hopkins 
the rate of homicide for that age group was very steady across 
each of the six years she said the data probably has always 
been there but nobody has looked at it in just this way before 
murder accounted for 17 percent of all of the injury deaths among 
children in the age group she said the homicide death rate for the 
infants was 568 per 100000 per year fractionally higher than for 
infants killed in vehicle accidents the most common type of injury 
deaths among all other age groups 
we dont have any good explanation said ms waller 
of the 1250 infants murdered onethird were reported to have 
died of what was called child abuse which would include beating 
and battering she said about 11 percent died of suffocation or 
strangulation 3 percent from drowning 3 percent from stabbing and 
about 5 percent from firearms 
ms waller said 65 percent of the murdered infants died of what 
is called neglectabandonment this would include babies left alone 
or neglected with intent to injure or kill 
the balance of the infants died of unspecified or unreported 
homicide causes 
infant homicides were included in a massive study by the hopkins 
group of all types of injury deaths among children 
though there were declines in most categories ms waller said 
suicides among children aged 10 to 14 more than doubled from 1980 to 
1985 
this is the one category where we saw a great increase she 
said it went up each year it is terribly shocking 
suicides in the 10 to 14yearold group increased from a rate of 
76 per 100000 in 1980 to 161 per 100000 in 1985 most killed 
themselves with guns or by hanging 
some of the increase may be due to a greater willingness to 
classify deaths as suicides ms waller said but i dont think 
that is enough of an explanation for the increases that we saw 
the hopkins study found that injuries continue to be the leading 
cause of death among children under age 14 with such traumas 
costing about 10000 childhood lives a year 
as a whole motor vehiclerelated accidents killed the most 
children the report said that 22174 children died in such 
accidents during the six years studied about 37 percent of all 
injuryrelated child deaths 
other major causes of death were drowning house fires 
suffocation accidental shooting falls choking on food or other 
objects poison electrical accidents and farm machinery accidents 
counting all causes the average injury death rate among children 
for the six years was about 193 per 100000 
for ages 1 to 4 injuries accounted for 44 percent of all deaths 
the rate was 51 percent for ages 5 to 9 and 58 percent for ages 10 
to 14 
in 26 states injuries received as a passenger in a motor vehicle 
were the leading cause of death for children 14 and under 
for the same age group house fires were the leading cause of 
injury death in 11 states drowning in 10 states and pedestrian 
accidents in massachusetts new york and rhode island 
in the district of columbia homicide was the the leading cause 
of death among children up to the age of 14 
the study was published in the march issue of the american 
journal of public health

eight people were charged tuesday with running a 
sophisticated drug ring that exported cocaine to italy where it was 
traded for heroin that was shipped to us drug dealers federal 
authorities said 
a lengthy investigation by us italian and canadian law 
enforcement authorities resulted in the arrests on monday at seven 
locations in the city and on long island law enforcement officials 
said 
the investigation centered on an italian crime organization 
called ndrangheta which is similar in structure to the mafia and is 
heavily involved in shipping heroin into the united states said 
assistant us attorney andrew c mccarthy 
the crime group imported heroin into the united states paid for 
with cocaine which was smuggled out of the country and shipped to 
italy where it is in great demand mccarthy said 
the drug barter system to a large extent eliminated the trail 
that would have been left had cash been used to pay for the heroin 
he said 
the defendants allegedly shipped at least some cocaine to italy 
through the mail authorities said 
last thursday two of the defendants charged tuesday allegedly 
mailed a box containing about 14 pounds of cocaine to italy 
however drug agents who learned of the plan through a wiretap 
intercepted the shipment of drugs authorities said 
defendant vincenzo restagno 24 who lives in toronto few there 
a few days earlier from italy with 350000 in italian currency 
which authorities say was brought to the united states and used to 
buy cocaine 
searches and arrests which went late into the night on monday

hes known as the flying archbishop but roger 
mahony insists his new helicopter is a way to take on the citys 
nagging traffic problem not a takeoff of the 1960s television 
series the flying nun 
its part of the southern california scene now traffic is 
really a problem said the archbishop who demonstrated the 
400000 gift tuesday with a spin over parts of the 
8762squaremile archdiocese of los angeles 
mahony 53 who has a helicopter pilots license and about 140 
hours flying time flew the bluestriped turbinepowered mcdonnell 
douglas 500d around van nuys airport for about 15 minutes after a 
news conference 
the 160mph helicopter blessed by the archbishop and sporting a 
st christopher medal on the instrument panel was donated by a 
group of businessmen to enable mahony to better minister to the 
nations most populous roman catholic archdiocese 
the threecounty jurisdiction larger than the nation of israel 
has 275 parishes and nearly 300 schools in rural agricultural areas 
the mojave desert and the urban and suburban sprawl of metropolitan 
los angeles 
if in fact you could guarantee that every day any hour you 
could get on the freeways and really go quickly it would be i think 
a little different situation mahony said 
the helicopter has generated criticism from some advocates for 
the poor who say the money could have been better spent in the 
archdiocese which serves 27 million catholics in los angeles 
ventura and santa barbara counties 
mahony said he accepted it under the strict condition that 
acquisition and operation would not cost the archdiocese anything 
and he blunted the criticism by elaborating on the generosity of the 
donors 
although they do not desire their names to be made public 
nonetheless i must emphasize that each is a major contributor to a 
wide variety of church and community projects most contributing in 
the milliondollar range for our innercity catholic schools 
projects for the homeless hunger programs and many other 
charitable endeavors mahony said 
mahony is seeking landing rights near his downtown residence st 
vibianas cathedral and at a number of catholic high school 
football fields a number of local catholic hospitals already have 
helipads

the armed forces on tuesday 
declared a unilateral halt to military operations involving offense 
and called on leftist rebels to reciprocate 
the armed forces press office said in a statement that the 
ceasefire would begin at midnight tuesday 1 am wednesday est 
and run through june 1 when president jose napoleon duartes term 
in office ends 
it asked the guerrillas to reciprocate to comply with the 
salvadoran peoples desire to peace it did not say whether the 
armed forces would abide by the ceasefire if the guerrillas kept up 
their military attacks 
no immediate response to the announcement came from the rebels 
farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln the government 
had no comment on the announcement 
political party leaders said late tuesday they were still 
studying the move by the armed forces 
the gesture came after the five farabundo marti commanders said 
in a communique that they were willing to discuss peace with duarte 
but rejected the venue and agenda he suggested sunday night 
it said the fmln sees as positive duartes willingness to hold 
talks among the government our front and the political parties 
but it also lamented duartes invariable design to obtain our 
surrender which is unrealistic illogical and impossible 
this design is made very clear by his suggestion of a closed 
agenda that does not take into account our proposals it said 
it was unclear tuesday if the conflicting positions could be 
reconciled both stemmed from a jan 24 guerrilla peace overture 
that called for postponing the presidential election now scheduled 
for march 19 
in addition the executive branch and the oppositioncontrolled 
legislature were at odds over how to respond to the rebels the fmln 
has said lawmakers should be part of any peace talks 
in a separate development the insurgents announced they have 
suspended the use of carbombs in heavily populated areas because of 
the danger to civilians 
duarte had proposed that the government and the rebels each 
declare a threemonth ceasefire beginning tuesday and that peace 
talks start the same day in guatemala 
the rebels rejected the venue saying talks should be among and 
in full view of all salvadorans on saturday and sunday in san 
salvador 
the insurgents also balked at a long unilateral ceasefire they 
said they were ready for a ceasefire during the talks but a lasting 
truce should be part of the negotiations 
duarte said sunday the ceasefire should be in place before 
negotiations begin 
he said the talks would cover the definitive end of the war 
incorporating of the fmln into the political mainstream and rebel 
recognition of the government armed forces as el salvadors only 
legitimate military institution 
the guerrilla agenda reiterated tuesday includes reducing the 
armed forces from their current level of 56000 to the prewar 
strength of 12000 
they also repeated their demand that the three separate police 
forces be disbanded and a single civiliancontrolled police force 
be established 
military officers responsible for gross violations of human 
rights must be tried and punished the guerrillas said 
despite civilian rule the army remains the countrys most 
powerful institution the rebel demands regarding the armed forces 
are considered major perhaps insurmountable stumbling blocks 
a 9yearold civil war has ravaged this massachusettssized 
country of 5 million people an estimated 70000 people have been 
killed and between 500000 and 1 million people displaced 
washington has provided el salvador with more than 35 billion 
in economic and military assistance this decade 
the state department called duartes address the most 
significant opportunity ever for achieving peace 
but prospects for the main guerrilla demand postponing the 
presidential election remained slim the rebels say they would 
participate in and respect the outcome of the vote if it were put 
off several months 
they have boycotted and condemned as sham the previous five 
national elections this decade 
the rightist republican nationalist alliance or arena which 
controls the legislature and is favored to win the presidential 
election has opposed any postponement of the vote 
the legislature has also given no indication it would take part 
in talks with the rebels 
duartes sunday proposal has the support of the united states

350 pm and was expected to arrive in the us energy departments 
dump at hanford wash in about 60 days department spokesman tom 
bauman said 
everything went smoothly and there were no problems bauman 
said 
the vessel and tank were packed in concrete and lifted onto the 
200foot seagoing barge paul bunyan in the ohio river last month 
the trip was delayed until tuesday because of poor weather 
the speed of the barges progress along the route down the ohio 
and mississippi rivers and through the gulf of mexico to the panama 
canal and the pacific ocean also will depend on the weather bauman 
said 
the reactor vessel was hoisted from its underground site at 
shippingport about 30 miles from pittsburgh on dec 14 
the shippingport plant was dedicated by president eisenhower in 
1957 and retired in 1982 after generating 65 billion kilowatthours 
of electricity 
it is the worlds only commercial reactor to be dismantled 
several nuclear plants have been mothballed or entombed 
the government hopes to show that reactors that have outlived 
their usefulness can be dismantled safely and affordably 
federal officials intend to remove all radioactive material so 
the shippingport site can be returned to unrestricted use no 
decision has been made as to how to use the land 
the decommissioning which has lasted five years is expected to 
be completed by 1990 at a cost of about 98 million

the crisis over aging jetliners should mean more 
new orders placed with manufacturers some industry analysts say 
but others ask whether new orders will solve airlines problems 
at this point pouring more orders into the funnel isnt going 
to make more airplanes come out at the bottom wolfgang h 
demisch an aerospace strategist at the new york office of union 
bank of switzerland said tuesday 
the greater risk is that in this rush suppliers will be 
overstretched and cant deliver as quickly as expected demisch 
said already there are components in tight supply and thats not 
going to get much easier 
reacting to the aging aircraft task forces recommendation that 
the federal aviation administration order 800 million in mandatory 
maintenance many analysts predicted the pressure to replace older 
planes would increase 
paul h nisbet of prudentialbache securities inc said airlines 
saw the need to replace planes several years ago as maintenance 
costs began rising and began placing orders accordingly 
i think a lot of orders seen in the last two or three years 
have been for replacement nisbet said before that orders were 
just for traffic growth 
nisbet said that of the 600 to 700 new plane orders he sees in 
each of the next few years as many as 200 to 300 will be to replace 
older planes 
the replacement cycle has begun he said 
boeing cos stock has held firm in the 60 range during the 
latest incident involving a plane it built a united airlines 747 
flying from honolulu to new zealand its forward fuselage ripped 
after takeoff 
nine passengers were sucked from the plane and hurled to their 
deaths investigators have focused on a forward cargo door as a 
likely cause 
george shapiro of salomon brothers inc in new york said 
consumers havent blamed carriers or boeing for the united incident 
the crash of a british midland airways 737 which killed 44 or for 
the aloha airlines 737 which lost part of its cabin in flight 
killing a stewardess 
theres no question boeing is going through a string of 
unfortunate troubles from crashes holes developing in its planes 
in flight and with quality problems on new aircraft he said 
but boeing has more planes out there than any other 
manufacturer and they are getting older shapiro said in an 
interview with the seattle times 
boeing officials have said repeatedly that there is no connection 
between the recent spate of accidents and that their timing is the 
result of coincidence and not quality problems on boeings assembly 
lines 
demisch said manufacturers boeing mcdonnell douglas and airbus 
industrie already face challenges in meeting commitments already 
made all three manufacturers are enjoying a boom in aircraft orders 
for some models orders placed today wont be fulfilled until 
1996 he noted

the government suspended constitutional 
rights on tuesday and imposed a curfew throughout the nation as 
riots over price increases ravaged venezuela for a second day and 
looting spread 
president carlos andres perez appealed on television for an end 
to the incredible tragedywhich according to police estimates 
killed up to 50 people and injured 500 
even as perez spoke gunfire was heard in the streets and rioting 
and looting continued in the worst violence in 30 years of 
democratic rule authorities said thousands were arrested 
in the eastern shantytown of petare battles between police and 
rioters killed 17 people victims were carried down from the hills 
to major avenues to be taken to hospitals while crowds watched said 
witnesses 
civilians and police exchanged gunfire and shop owners took up 
arms to protect their property the education ministry ordered 
school and university classes suspended nationwide 
the curfew was in effect from 8 pm tuesday evening to 6 am 
and beginning wednesday from 6 pm to 6 am 
army patrols in caracas patrolled the empty streets as the curfew 
went into effect gunfire and explosions were heard as soldiers and 
police fought snipers and looters in some neighborhoods in west and 
east caracas 
the capital looked like a ghost town with only ambulances and 
specially authorized vehicles operating army units stood at 
strategic downtown corners rough estimates said up to 10000 troops 
may have been mobilized in caracas 
maracaibo san cristobal valencia maracay and puerto la cruz 
all scenes of rampaging violence earlier were reported calm 
among the rights suspended indefinitely were those guaranteeing 
public gatherings limits on police searches and arrests and 
freedom of expression the last time that happened was 1964 when 
venezuela was plagued by cubanbacked guerrillas 
riots exploded monday over increases in bus fares and gasoline 
prices announced in a recent economic package that included higher 
prices for food and basic items violence began in caracas and 
rapidly spread to other cities 
the measures announced two weeks after perez took office feb 2 
were required before the international monetary fund would grant 
15 billion in badly needed credit venezuela signed a letter of 
intent for the credit on tuesday 
perez said the riots meant the country was risking the 
definitive consolidation of its democratic process this is an 
incredible tragedy dozens have been killed and hundreds 
wounded 
perez said the imf is the only option open to a country which 
has run out of reserves 
venezuelas operating reserves are down to 15 billion 
according to official figures bankers say the true level is closer 
to 200 million to 400 million or barely enough for two weeks of 
imports 
for 30 years one of the most politically stable countries in 
south america venezuelas oilbased economy is now in a deep 
recession inflation is expected to be at least 70 percent this 
year up from 35 percent last year 
on tuesday metropolitan police inspector omar bolivar said the 
riots are much worse than yesterday rioters are betterarmed than 
we are they have rifles pistols revolvers even submachine guns 
out there 
a police commisioner was shot dead by rioters tuesday and 17 
policemen were injured police said 
policemen in caracas fired shotguns and tear gas to disperse 
crowds trying to gather in grocery stores more than 300 shops and

centers in the wealthy neighborhood of san bernardino in a scene one 
tv reporter described as collective madness 
some people brought cars and station wagons to carry things 
away said a reporter for radio caracas television 
officially bus fares were to rise only about 30 percent on 
urban routes for example from the equivalent of about a nickel to 
7 cents but transportation minister gustavo rada said some 
increases were as high as 50 percent apparently because of 
pricegouging by bus drivers 
caracas residents said rising food prices also were to blame 
it was about time something like this happened people finally 
got fed up and came down from the hills to protest said josefina 
vasquez a neighborhood leader 
others called the looters common criminals taking advantage of 
mass confusion

president bushs fullcourt press to salvage 
john towers nomination as defense secretary produced no new 
immediate pledges of support tuesday and senate republicans sought 
to delay a showdown vote until next week 
im working hard at it bush told reporters at a 
picturetaking session during an afternoon cabinet meeting after he 
met privately with a dozen swing democrats and wavering republicans 
im committed 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas speaking to 
reporters after an evening meeting with bush said were going to 
go to the mat he said debate on the nomination would begin 
wednesday afternoon or thursday possibly delaying a vote until next 
week 
i would assume its going to take more than a couple of days 
dole said we need some time to explain our case to the american 
people because i sense a change going on 
dole said the confirmation process so far has not been 
fair to tower 
its our hope we can see the record straight and do a thorough 
debate with our colleagues on the senate floor he said 
sen john warner rva ranking minority member on the senate 
armed services committee said republicans planned a full floor 
debate to persuade americans that bush has the right to his chosen 
nominee 
we cannot let this case stand as an example of whether or not 
power was tried to be wrested from the president of the united 
states by the majority in the senate just for political reasons 
warner said 
before the evening meeting republican sen larry pressler of 
south dakota a wavering senator important to the drive to hold all 
45 senate republicans in line announced he was very much leaning 
against confirmation and urged tower to withdraw before a vote 
i think that he may very well be doing him bush a favor in 
this case said pressler who said he was fearful that tower would 
not be capable of cleaning up the pentagon procurement system if 
confirmed 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters that there 
was no chance whatsoever of the president withdrawing the 
nomination 
were going to fight it out as far as we can weve convinced a 
lot of senators and we hope to convince a lot more said 
fitzwater who refused to specify what senators had been won over 
formal debate on the nomination is scheduled to open wednesday 
and senators are reading a confidential fbi report on the former 
texas senators drinking habits charges of womanizing and lucrative 
consulting contracts with military companies 
although the white house has sought to portray the report as 
clearing tower of damaging allegations democrats have disagreed 
with that assessment 
sen ernest hollings dsc who indicated his opposition to the 
nomination said the report is overwhelming its not a close 
call 
there are names facts absolute statements the words 
crocked bombed excessive drinking sloshing stoned 
comatose too much of that hollings said he said the 
allegations against tower are recent credible and overwhelming 
a draft of the senate armed services committees majority report 
that will be presented to the full senate cited towers personal 
conduct including his excessive use of alcohol and indiscreet 
behavior toward women said congressional sources who requested 
anonymity 
the report also noted that towers practice of advising defense 
contractors on arms control issues shortly after serving as arms 
control negotiator created an appearance of using public office for 
private gain 
in aggregate these concerns led the committee to determine 
that towers personal conduct discretion and judgment did not meet 
the demanding standards of the postion of secretary of defense 
especially in terms of his suitability to serve in the chain of 
command 
a draft of the republican committee members report a copy of 
which was obtained by the associated press said tower is fully 
and ably qualified to serve as the secretary of defense the facts 
are not and cannot be altered by allegation rumor or innuendo 
the republican report also said tower took the ultimate step 
in vowing to abstain from alcohol if confirmed by the senate 
the committee had been scheduled to meet to review both reports 
but warner said the session was canceled so that he and dole could 
meet with bush and tower at the white house 
democrats on the committee still met tuesday night to review the 
two reports 
meanwhile an abcwashington post telephone poll conducted monday 
night showed 52 percent of those surveyed favoring towers 
confirmation a similar poll on feb 9 had shown only 44 percent 
support for the senate confirming tower as defense secretary 
in the latest poll 44 percent said tower should not be 
confirmed down from 46 percent in the feb 9 poll a total of 531 
adult men and women were polled the survey had a margin of error of 
5 percent meaning that if everyone adult in the country had been 
polled the results might be up to 5 percentage points different in 
either direction 
sen joseph lieberman a freshman democrat from connecticut said 
after meeting with bush that he was still undecided but that if 
possible bush should be given the benefit of the doubt on his 
nominations 
sen john breaux dla a swing democrat who met privately with 
bush in the oval office said he was leaning against the nomination 
based on towers drinking habits the former senator has 
acknowledged drinking heavily during the 1970s but says he now has 
only an occasional glass of wine with dinner 
another democrat who went to the white house sen dennis 
deconcini of arizona said he was somewhat more predisposed to vote 
for tower but he too expressed concern over towers drinking 
habits deconcini said a reading of much of the fbi report found 
damaging things in there some outrageous things absurd 
bush said he did not know whether he could win over senators who 
have indicated opposition to tower saying only that i hope so 
but vice president dan quayle said he believed that all 45 gop 
senators including pressler would vote to confirm tower if five 
democrats can be persuaded to vote for tower that would allow 
quayle to cast the decisive tiebreaking vote for the nominee 
well take the votes any way we can get them quayle said 
adding that senators should not vote against tower simply because he 
may have stepped on a lot of toes during his service as a 
direct tough competitive chairman of the senate armed services 
committee 
with tower sitting on his left in the cabinet room the president 
said he had not heard anyone challenge this mans knowledge and 
his ability 
hes the best to do the job that needs to be done bush said 
i dont believe that anybody should be pilloried on the basis of 
unfounded rumor ive known john tower a long time longer than many 
that are criticizing him out there in various walks of life 
senators citing concerns about towers drinking habits as the 
reason for their opposition drew the ire of at least one leading 
republican deputy gop leader alan simpson of wyoming 
there are still a couple that still gallop around with a little 
bit of grape and grain on their breaths what a hypocrisy simpson 
said were not going to sit still and watch this occur this is 
the height of stupidness 
tower sought to allay the fears of his former colleagues issuing 
an extraordinary pledge sunday to abstain from drinking if he is 
confirmed by the senate 
with democrats holding a 5545 majority in the senate 
republicans can illafford any defections from their own ranks if 
bush is to prevail in the first highstakes political showdown of 
his 5weekold presidency 
bush invited several democrats and republicans to the white house 
for a series of oneonone meetings to discuss the nomination 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine who has not 
announced his position did not talk with reporters as he left the 
white house sen james exon dneb has said he expected mitchell 
will oppose the nomination which has failed thus far to attract the 
public support of any democratic senator 
the president held meetings with sens charles robb dva 
christopher dodd dconn lloyd bentsen dtexas bill bradley 
dnj and bennett johnston dla 
tower chaired the panel from 1981 through 1984 the committee 
now controlled by democrats voted 119 along party lines last 
thursday to recommend the full senate reject towers nomination

the directors of the national transplant 
network on tuesday adopted a policy discouraging the use of babies 
who were born without most of their brains but are not yet brain 
dead as organ donors 
however the board of the united network for organ sharing said 
it would be unwise to totally prohibit using anencephalic babies as 
organ donors 
experts and ethicists have been divided for some time over 
whether to transplant the hearts livers and kidneys of anencephalic 
infants into other dying babies for whom there is an extreme 
shortage of organs 
anencephalic infants are born with only part of a brain stem 
which controls respiration because they do have slight brain stem 
activity they are not legally brain dead which is required before 
organs can be removed 
by the time such infants are brain dead their organs often are 
not fit for transplantation because of infection 
half of the 1000 to 2000 anencephalic babies born each year in 
the united states are stillborn the other half generally die within 
one week 
only one anencephalic child has ever had its organs removed for 
transplantation in the united states that case on oct 16 1987 
involved a canadian donor and recipient and was performed at loma 
linda university medical center in california 
the heart recipient a boy who was born the day of the operation 
is at home and doing well said hospital spokeswoman anita rockwell 
loma linda has had a moratorium since august on cases involving 
infants suffering from the incurable birth defect 
anencephalic infants reportedly have been used with family 
consent as organ donors in canada europe and japan 
what the recommendation says is that people for the time 
being approach the use of infants with anencephaly with extreme 
caution that it would not be wise to use any such baby as an organ 
donor until a consensus has been reached about how to pronounce 
death in a newborn art caplan director of the center for 
biomedical ethics at the university of minnesota said in a 
telephone interview from minneapolis 
caplan was part of an ethics committee that recently presented 
the recommendation to the networks 32member board of directors 
the virginiabased network administers the national organ 
procurement and transplantation network 
the board adopted the position during a regular meeting in new 
orleans members include doctors organ procurement officials 
ethicists theologians lawyers and healthcare finance 
administrators 
the board concluded that a moratorium would not be wise because 
it would preclude organ donations by anencephalic infants who are 
brain dead and whose parents strongly desire to donate their childs 
organs said dr jeremiah g turcotte chairman of the ethics 
committee 
the board said further study is needed and could prompt a 
reevaluation of its position 
brian broznick director of the pittsburgh transplant foundation 
said there likely would be enough organs for the 400 to 500 children 
awaiting liver transplants in the united states if anencephalic 
infants were used as donors 
we could probably take care of all those kids and we cant do 
anything about it broznick said its a real sad situation

interviewing on campus and did not allow advertising in campus 
publications said elizabeth norris a spokeswoman for the 
chicagobased magazine some area hotels also prohibited interviews

word out she said adding that sales have been known to increase 
as much as 600 percent in areas featured in an issue 
she said playboy expects to exceed the standard monthly 
circulation of 34 million issues but would not specify how many

richard m daley is short and stocky and on 
occasion stubborn unmistakably his fathers son 
but as he stands within striking distance of the fifthfloor city 
hall office occupied for 21 years by his father the late richard j 
daley he can proudly say he got there the oldfashioned way he 
earned it 
to be sure he has benefited from the name the lucrative 
assignments while he was a young attorney in private practice his 
election to the illinois senate at age 29 and the successful bids 
for three terms as cook countys top prosecutor 
but the 46yearold daley who defeated mayor eugene sawyer in 
tuesdays democratic primary has suffered because of the name as 
well critics have dogged his every step up the political ladder 
suggesting his achievements have been little more than an accident 
of birth 
if his name wasnt richard daley hed be working in the post 
office said rob warden editor of chicago lawyer 
both assessments miss the point said eugene kennedy a loyola 
university professor veteran political analyst and author of 
himself a biography of the elder daley 
there is an old chinese proverb that says in essence grass 
grows short under a big tree and plenty of sons are considered 
failures when measured against their fathers said kennedy 
the truth is theres nobody like his father but rich has 
acquired a confidence in himself and his judgment that resemble the 
father in some ways and hes overcome enough adversity on his own 
the loss of a young son the loss in his first mayoral run in 1983 
to establish a separate identity to start the long climb out from 
under his fathers shadow kennedy said 
the eldest of seven children daley cut his political teeth 
working as an 18yearold page for the illinois delegation to the 
1960 democratic national convention 
twelve years and a law degree later he passed the bar exam 
after a third try daleys political career began in earnest in the 
illinois senate 
he was criticized in his early years labeled his fathers eyes 
and ears 
but daley showed more acumen than many gave him credit for 
forging cautious alliances with reformers opponents of his 
fathers vaunted democratic machine and championing socialwelfare 
legislation affecting nursing homes and abolishing taxes on certain 
foods and medicine 
his fathers death in 1976 several months into a sixth term 
caused an irreparable rift in the political organization the 
longtime mayor had so zealously guarded 
as a result four years later the younger daley ran for cook 
county states attorney as an outsider against alderman edward 
burke the partys endorsed candidate 
daley clobbered burke then twice won reelection as the countys 
top prosecutor along the way he proved himself a savvy campaigner 
able to use his name and his fathers cronies but receptive to new 
ideas and alliances 
that knack he may have gotten from his father 
state sen howard carroll who was a law school friend recalled 
that daley carried a dictionary so he could look up any word he 
didnt know 
and while he was looking up that word hed always look for 
another word he didnt know on the same page so he could learn a new 
word said carroll 
i think he got that from his father

napa county supervisors voted tuesday to seek 
a court order halting a socalled aryan woodstock an outdoor 
concert on private land planned for saturday by white supremacists 
and skinheads 
after an emotional hearing attended by about 150 people the 
board decided to ask county district attorney jerry mautner to seek 
a temporary restraining order blocking the event 
mautners office said the district attorney may seek the order as 
early as wednesday 
tom metzger director of the white aryan resistance told the 
board the event would be on private land and would be by invitation 
only he said some 2000 people have been invited to listen to such 
bands as the boot boys and hammerhead 
the issue he said is simple shall we have freedom of speech 
and assembly or shall we not 
choking back tears golda lerman of napa told the board she lost 
much of her family to the nazi holocaust of world war ii 
i grew up with the legacy you people caused she said 
referring to the concert sponsors i have no aunts no uncles 
i believe in the freedom of speech and the right to assembly 
but not the right to violence against minorities she said 
legal opposition to the concert is based on a rarelyused 1971 
county ordinance requiring a permit for outdoor concerts no permit

the chicago board of trade has levied a 1125 
million fine against a man convicted of devising a scam that 
involved wearing disguises to back out of illfated deals in the 
trading pits 
thompson sanders also was banned for life from the exchange but 
his attorney says hell appeal 
the commodity exchanges decision comes four months after a 
federal judge sentenced sanders to six years in prison and fined him 
300000 for masterminding a scheme that involved disguising a 
trader in a wig and makeup to make illegal transactions in the 
treasury bond pit 
prosecutors said that because of the disguises sanders and three 
others were able to pocket more than 300000 from good trades while 
backing out of losing trades without detection 
the bot fine of 1125 million imposed on sanders is the maximum 
penalty that exchange rules allow for his 15 rule violations 
at the time of his conviction us district judge marvin aspen 
said sanders crimes represented the tip of the iceberg and that 
because of loose regulations the bot was a potential cesspool 
of corruption 
since disclosure last month of the fbi investigation into fraud 
at chicagos futures exchanges the bot has increased the maximum 
fine from 75000 to 250000 per violation the bot also has 
extended the period during which former members could be subject to 
discipline from 30 days to five years 
in addition the exchange said it would spend 1 million to 
improve its computerized surveillance system 
sanders free on 300000 bond has appealed the criminal 
conviction he also will appeal the bot decision on grounds that the 
board does not have jurisdiction over him said his attorney 
stephen senderowitz 
sanders is not a member nor was he at the time he was charged 
in the criminal case or in the exchange disciplinary proceeding 
senderowitz said

experts on treating alcohol abuse have these 
words of advice about defense secretarydesignate john towers 
pledge of abstinence believe it when you see it 
marc hertzman professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at 
george washington university said it is easy and common for heavy 
drinkers to take the pledge but rare for such vows to be kept 
lets assume that only a very small part of what has been 
rumored about the gentleman has any validity to it at all said 
hertzman the notion that he could just stop is about 180 degrees 
counter to anything that anybody knows about the problem of dealing 
with drinking alcohol 
tower whose nomination to become secretary of defense comes 
before the senate this week has admitted to having been a heavy 
drinker in the past but in an extraordinary television interview on 
sunday he vowed not to drink beverage alcohol of any type or 
form including wine beer or spirits of any kind if he is 
confirmed to the cabinet position

president bushs fastpaced asian trip provided 
a daily dose of telegenic photo opportunities but few clues about 
his brand of foreign policy other than that it will tone down 
americas approach on human rights 
it seemed bushs purpose in more than 18000 miles of travel was 
simply to touch base with other leaders and reaffirm friendly 
relations there was no sign of any new initiatives 
over five days bush zipped through tokyo beijing and seoul 
pumping hands and posing for pictures with more than 20 foreign 
leaders in dramatic settings the only time bush stood still was 
during a threehour appearance at the funeral of emperor hirohito 
not everything came off quite as planned the white house script 
did not call for the trip to vie for attention with the drama at

alarms that have wailed in rancho 
secos control room are silent but the problemplagued nuclear 
power plant is in the midst of perhaps its worst crisis just months 
before voters will decide its fate 
utility operators are struggling to convince voters that a 400 
million overhaul following a december 1985 accident made the plant 
safe and efficient 
but rancho seco which restarted last year after a 27month 
shutdown has been idled four times during the past three months by 
mechanical problems the latest shutdown caused by the failure of 
an auxiliary water pump on feb 1 isnt expected to be lifted 
before early march 
critics say the recent performance shows that rancho seco which 
has had more than 100 outages since it opened in 1974 and until 
recently was rated one of the nations 10 worst nuclear plants has 
flunked a probationary measure passed by voters last june the 
measure gave operators a temporary reprieve to fix problems before 
another vote to decide the plants fate the vote is scheduled for

linda ronstadt has sung rock country standards 
and even opera once but she found yet a new style on a recent tour 
singing an evenings worth of songs only in spanish 
even people who didnt understand a word of spanish enjoyed the 
show thanks to ronstadts involved performance the colorful 
staging and the mariachi band and singers who performed with her 
canciones de mi padre songs of my father is also a 
record album that recently won a grammy award as best 
mexicanamerican performance ronstadt sang a selection on the 
nationally televised grammy awards show 
now canciones de mi padre is a television show airing friday 
as part of pbs great performances series 
it was important to structure the show so you wouldnt have to 
understand spanish or anything about mexican culture said 
ronstadt who says she understands every word she sings but doesnt 
speak conversational spanish 
does the television special mark the finale of ronstadts 
mexican phase she says an emphatic no im never going to 
stop doing it its great music theres a huge amount of it i just 
scratched the surface 
mexican music is the first music i ever heard and learned 
mexico provides much of ronstadts heritage at the beginning of 
the tv show she is pictured with her father though he isnt 
identified both he and she were born in tucson she says some 
say that part of arizona was stolen from mexico im one of the ones 
who thinks it was stolen his father was born in mexico my family 
has been ranchers for generations in the sonora desert region 
my greatgreatgrandmother was born in mexico too in the san 
gabriel valley thats now california the us got away with 
california too 
this mexican culture is pretty firmly ensconced out here 
people have a tendency to forget that 
the fact that ronstadt sounds like a german instead of a spanish 
name doesnt mean somebody changed the name the singer says 
mexico is a melting pot like the united states there was a 
migration of french they ruled mexico awhile there was a migration 
of germans when they discovered mining my greatgreatgrandfather 
was a mining engineer from germany he married a mexican woman whose 
family had been there a long time 
mexican music has a lot of longheld notes and falsetto breaks 
i grew up listening to this i learned how to do it ronstadt 
says i used some of it on the end of blue bayou 
ive been fooling around with this music a long time ive been 
figuring out a way i could record it and present it to north 
americans 
first she and her father wrote hasten down the wind which 
she sang mainly in spanish in american pop style what i wanted 
to do was traditional mexican stop fooling around and not make any 
concessions at all to the pop market she said i wanted to do 
it with original arrangements and bands i loved and i did it and 
it worked i thought it was strong enough to bridge the gap 
she says if you listen to country music out of texas theres a 
great similarity it is rural music a lot of vocal tradition is 
shared by american and mexican country music 
and roy rogers cowboy suit the embroidery yoked shirt and 
flared pant legs is mexican a regional style in northern sonora 
people dont know that 
all costumes and stage design are mexican ronstadt says i 
didnt want anything hollywood or broadway i thought what was there 
was so rich it couldnt be improved on 
ronstadt isnt the only singer in her family her fathers 
sister luisa espinel ronstadt who used her first two names 
professionally was a singer dancer and movie actress in the 1920s 
her picture is shown on the tv show 
she died in the 1960s but she used to come and visit she 
taught us how to do the shimmy and play castanets and roll our eyes 
at the boys 
one of ronstadts sisters her brother and his 18yearold 
daughter sing harmony on the tv show 
now ronstadt is making plans to perform a show in los angeles 
where shell sing in three styles rock n roll standards set to 
nelson riddle arrangements and mexican songs that definitely wont 
be a tour she laughs its too expensive i have to have an 
orchestra and two different bands

intended to ease strains between the vatican and 
us catholicism an extraordinary summit meeting convenes next week 
between american archbishops and pope john paul ii 
he calls the concentrated four days of talks a fraternal 
encounter archbishops say they expect a friendly mutually 
cooperative mood 
this isnt shaping up as a confrontation but rather as a 
helpful exchange of views among church leaders looking for ways to 
work together effectively says cardinal joseph bernardin of 
chicago 
several of the earlier tensions have faded but others remain 
such as the handling of dissent from church regulations and the 
status of the bishops national organization itself 
that in a way is perhaps most important says the rev 
thomas j reeske of washington d c whose research has made him a 
leading authority on attitudes of us bishops 
he added in an interview 
the issue is whether episcopal conferences have the right and 
authority to teach and make decisions that have an impact on the 
life of the church in the united states or whether all the 
decisions are to be made in rome 
the trend has been toward centralizing decisions in rome 
differences with the vatican both on approaches to dissent and 
the rights of the bishops national conference showed up only at 
their meeting last november 
the vatican intervened to get them to postpone acting on their 
document doctrinal responsibilities on dealing with dissent 
also the bishops disapproved a vatican draft minimizing the role 
of bishops conferences 
it was returned as unsuitable even as a basis for discussion 
the bishops and the vatican also temporarily differed over makeup 
of the summit meeting itself they in 15 regional sessions last 
fall had elected representatives to attend but the vatican said 
no it wanted only archbishops 
that was another slight of the bishops conferences reese 
said adding their elected representatives would have had some 
kind of mandate but thats not directly the case with the 
archbishops 
twentyone of the 35 us participants in the march 911 vatican 
meeting were appointed by the present pope the agenda says theyll 
have more than 12 hours of open discussion with him and heads of his 
cabinet the curia 
the theme in generalizing vatican terminology is 
evangelization in the context of the culture and society of the 
united states of america with particular emphasis on the role of the 
bishop as teacher of the faith 
the opaque language refers to the impact of christian values on 
society and culture a special concern of the pope examining that 
big picture ought to be a positive thing reese said the 
danger is the talk will just be in the abstract 
reese of woodstock theological center at washingtons georgetown 
university has individually interviewed the countrys archbishops 
for his forthcoming book archbishop inside the power structure 
of the american catholic church to be published in may by harper 
amp row 
he predicted conflict will be minimal at the vatican meeting 
on various matters such as the popes insistence on individual 
confession before first communion and his criticism of a previously 
extensive practice of giving general absolution without confession 
reese said 
the bishops have sort of caved in its no longer a big 
problem on a lot of issues the bishops conference has given up 
its way of doing things basically its doing what the vatican 
wants 
bishops at the vaticans behest banned special services for a 
homosexual organization dignity in many dioceses under vatican 
and other criticism of a document on aids the bishops last spring 
decided to write another one 
other issues also have receded since us bishops first suggested 
the meeting in 1986 when their then president bishop james malone 
of youngstown ohio cited a growing and dangerous disaffection 
from the holy see 
that was at a time of extensive resentment at the vaticans 
curtailing authority of seattles archibishop raymond hunthausen 
since restored 
differences still persist though now partly mollified between 
us catholic educators and vatican proposals for closer church 
supervision over catholic colleges and universities 
of the upcoming meeting the pope has said it will deal with 
impressions both of his 1987 visit to the united states and a 1988 
series bishops visits with the pope 
several bishops say the visits had a mostly positive upbeat 
tone the pope is bullish on the u s church says archbiship john 
l may of st louis president of the national conference of bishops 
however the pope has pressed his insistence on doctrinal 
conformity saying of the us scene 
certain positions on the socalled right to dissent have had 
harmful repercussions on the moral conduct of a number of the 
faithful there is a tendency on the part of some catholics to be 
selective in their adherence to the churchs moral teaching 
the pope also says he wants more systematic efforts on behalf 
of natural family planning more emphasis on the churchs ban on 
contraception widely practiced among us catholics and efforts to 
revive weekly mass attendance now down to an average 52 percent

during his 10year pontificate john paul ii 
has summoned dutch bishops to rome in an attempt to settle a serious 
rift and called brazilian bishops over liberation theology now it 
is the americans turn 
more than 30 us archbishops and two eastern rite metropolitans 
will take part in a special fourday meeting at the vatican march 
811 
the initiative for the meeting came from the americans in 1986 
when relations between the us church and the holy see appeared 
particularly tense but in the end it was the pope who wanted the 
meeting held according to vatican spokesman joaquin navarro 
after the popes visit to the united states in 1987 and a series 
of private talks at the vatican involving american bishops last 
year the us side no longer believed the special meeting was 
necessary navarro said 
but the pope insisted on the idea he said 
while the whole range of issues involving the church in america 
is likely to be discussed the main theme is expected to be the role 
of bishops 
what bishops should be doing out preaching the gospel in a 
secularized society is what i believe the meeting is about said 
one senior vatican official speaking on condition his name not be 
used 
he said the pope does not want bishops to be managers but rather 
ardent proponents of church teaching 
speaking out on unpopular issues may be difficult the official 
said but added that in the popes view if we keep saying that 
youll never get anywhere 
it was the popes concerns about the leadership roles of bishops 
that led him to convene a synod of dutch bishops in 1980 and summon 
21 members of the church hierarchy from brazil the worlds largest 
roman catholic country in 1986 
john paul has also announced a special synod of bishops from 
africa the continent where the church has experienced its most 
rapid growth the date and location must still be fixed 
vatican officials are also not excluding meetings with bishops 
from other countries where there are particular problems or ferment 
such meetings with bishops should be seen as a natural thing 
said navarro 
each country has its special problems he pointed out adding 
theres no prescription for all the countries of the world 
during his pontificate john paul has revived the practice of ad 
limina visits or visits by bishops to the vatican every five years 
that largely fell into disuse under pope paul vi john paul clearly 
likes to deal directly with his prelates to get his message across 
just as he likes to go directly to the people through his 
pilgrimages abroad 
the pope summoned the dutch bishops to rome because the church 
was split into conservative and liberal factions over issues such as 
celibacy and the role of women in the church the meeting was 
classified as a synod a more formal gathering than the brazilian 
and us meetings in that it requires followup action by the 
bishops and the vatican 
while there is no evidence the synod has dampened dissent among 
dutch catholics a series of papal appointments has given the 
conservative factions control of the leadership 
the brazilian church was also divided between progressives and 
conservatives although the leaders generally support liberation 
theology which emphasizes the churchs commitment to the poor the 
vatican has condemned some forms it says resemble marxism and the 
pope told the prelates they should not try to substitute for 
politicians 
the meeting ended with a joint statement by the prelates and the 
vatican stressing the importance of unity and pledging full 
adherence to church teaching 
navarro said the us meeting should not be viewed as 
confrontational and that he didnt expect the pope to review the 
past making a business analogy navarro said john paul would take 
the approach of a corporation head asking his people where do we 
go from here 
the pope delivered his major address of the september 1987 us 
pilgrimage to bishops in los angeles challenging them to crack down 
on catholics who dissent from church teaching he called it a 
grave error to believe that one could differ with church 
teaching and still consider oneself a good catholic 
the vatican has consistently rejected challenges to its teaching 
it recently criticized theologians who question the church ban on 
contraception in an attack apparently directed at 170 
germanspeaking theologians who signed a letter disagreeing with the 
vatican on the issue

bathing beauty photographed from the back will cover extralarge 
billboards in the san francisco and los angeles areas 
my number is 4153913365 and i drink johnnie walker the

the campaign may be expanded to other markets later 
john morrell a marketing executive for johnnie walker said the 
appraoch was designed as a parody of the personal ads and dating 
services 
he said the idea of posting a message on a billboard allows 
outdoor advertising to be something that it hasnt been before

agency said the ads are designed to give the consumer a little 
fun and involve them in our message 
he said that if people start talking about the ads he hopes 
liquor retailers will give johnnie walker more display space 
awareness of the brand will improve and sales will pick up 
morrell said combined sales of johnnie walker black label and red

dewars scotch 
one ad in the companys current campaign features two 
swimsuitclad women running on the beach with the headline he 
loves my mind and he drinks johnny walker the ads have generated 
complaints of sexism and bad taste

the management of a group buying the united 
states shoe corps footwear division for 4225 million says 
dramatic changes are not in store for the cincinnatibased division 
the footwear division will retain its existing management us 
shoes corporate headquarters and distribution facility in the city 
as well as the us shoe name officials said monday 
division president howard platt who will become president and 
chief executive officer of the new shoe company said the 
acquisition by a group headed by merrill lynch capital partners 
inc an affiliate of merrill lynch capital markets inc should not 
result in any job losses among its 8000 employees 
were not planning any reductions in the work force other than 
what occurs through the normal course of business platt said 
the purchase excludes us shoes cincinnatibased lenscrafters 
division which operates retail eyeglass stores and its womens 
apparel retail division based in enfield conn which operates the 
casual corner petite sophisticate and caren charles chains 
these divisions will be retained by the former us shoe which 
said it will choose a new corporate name 
us shoe shares fell 575 monday to close at 20 in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading it was the big boards 
secondmostactive issue 
analysts said the companys announcement failed to live up to 
expectations by some that the entire company would be sold 
although the domestic shoe industry has been hurt in recent years 
by foreign imports us shoes footwear business has positioned 
itself as one of the industrys strongest players through a 
combination of domestic and foreign production he said 
the division operates about 500 retail stores under the hahn and 
bannister store name and through leased departments it owns 20 
womens shoe brands including calvin klein capezio red cross 
selby liz claiborne and pappagallo 
in 1988 the footwear division which operates about 20 
manufacturing and distribution facilities in the us accounted for 
about onethird of us shoes 22 billion in sales and 57 percent 
of the the companys 52 million in profit 
the divisions domestic production represents about 10 percent to 
15 percent of the total us production of moderately priced shoes 
platt said 
platt said the buyout wont mean any slowdown in the divisions 
ongoing modernization program 
he said merrill lynchs offer was the best of several bids 
submitted for the shoe operation he declined to say what other bids 
were submitted 
but each bidder specified that the divisions current management 
remain in place this is a financially led buyout as opposed to a 
managementled buyout he said 
about 35 division executives will be part of the ownership group 
the exact percentage of the company they will own wont be known 
until merrill lynch completes its financing 
merrill lynch has commitments for 160 million of equity and debt 
financing and says it is highly confident it will secure the 
remaining financing through senior bank debt 
completion of the sale is expected in about three months

about whether stock prices were overheated also held back buying 
mike morizumi an analyst at merrill lynchs tokyo office called 
todays fall a technical correction 
investors seem to have used the us discount rate hike as an 
excuse to hold back from buying he said but the discount rate 
hike was well anticipated and its effects have already been 
discounted in share prices 
rather he said there was concern about constantly rising 
stock prices and it was actually an ideal timing for the market to 
make the adjustment

expectations of rising us interest rates 
higher us interest rates make dollardenominated investments 
more attractive to foreign investors 
on friday the us federal reserve raised its discount rate its 
charge for loans to private financial institutions from 65 percent

five former du pont co employees 
threatened to sell secret documents on synthetic fibers to a 
competitor or begin production themselves if the chemical giant 
didnt pay them 10 million authorities said 
four of the five were arrested on extortion charges monday in 
switzerland in a hotel parking lot after they failed to meet with du 
pont officials and an undercover fbi agent where an exchange was to 
take place said fbi agent joseph v corless 
du pont had planned to turn over a bogus 10 million check for 
the documents which deal with the production of lycra the 
companys trade name for spandex fiber used in clothing such as 
swimming suits leotards and pantyhose 
the suspects also were to sign a contract agreeing not to produce 
spandex fiber for five years corless said 
the five had worked at the du pont plant in mercedes argentina 
one of several plants that make spandex du pont was contacted about 
the documents in december four of the five had quit since 
september authorities said 
those arrested were bruno skerianz age unknown raul a 
giordano 36 operations supervisor for lycra production antonio r 
inigo 39 maintenance supervisor for lycra production and maria i 
lorenzo de bianchini 39 secretary of the lycra information office 
authorities said 
corless said ms de bianchini had the most access to the 
documents 
skerianz who worked at the plant about 20 years ago was 
believed to be the ringleader and recruited the others while they 
were working for du pont the others had been du pont employees for 
13 or 14 years 
a warrant was issued for jose m petrosino 44 specialist 
engineer for lycra processing who remained at large 
william carpenter an assistant us attorney said the five have 
been charged with one count each of attempted extortion and if 
convicted face up to 20 years in prison and a 250000 fine 
there are being held by swiss authorities and the united states 
will seek extradition corless said 
corless said the documents were recovered but he admitted there 
were no guarantees that copies had not been made 
considering du pont was willing to pay we hope there are no 
more copies he said we still have a lot of investigating to 
do 
john r malloy du pont spokesman at its wilmington headquarters 
said the information was very valuable and probably would have 
enabled them to set up a competing plant 
after the suspects contacted du pont several meetings were held 
inside and outside the united states and telephone calls were made 
to discuss the documents corless said skerianz met with du pont 
officials in wilmington and offered to sell the company certain 
spandex technology the fbi said 
corless said that skerianz refused to bring the documents to the 
united states but du pont officials examined the approximately 
1000 documents at a meeting in milan italy in january

alarms that have wailed in rancho 
secos control room are silent but the problemplagued nuclear 
power plant is in the midst of perhaps its worst crisis just months 
before voters will decide its fate 
utility operators are struggling to convince voters that a 400 
million overhaul following a december 1985 accident made the plant 
safe and efficient 
but rancho seco which restarted last year after a 27month 
shutdown has been idled four times during the past three months by 
mechanical problems the latest shutdown caused by the failure of 
an auxiliary water pump on feb 1 isnt expected to be lifted 
before early march 
critics say the recent performance shows that rancho seco which 
has had more than 100 outages since it opened in 1974 and until 
recently was rated one of the nations 10 worst nuclear plants has 
flunked a probationary measure passed by voters last june the 
measure gave operators a temporary reprieve to fix problems before 
another vote to decide the plants fate the vote is scheduled for 
june 6 
the current outage and the several experienced over the last 
two months demonstrate that rancho seco has failed its test says 
karl ory of campaign california a group formed by assemblyman tom 
hayden and actress jane fonda other critics include 
environmentalists and some ratepayers who say the plant is too 
costly to operate 
officials at sacramento municipal utility district the operator 
acknowledge that further problems could persuade voters to close the 
plant permanently 
i do not think it recent problems has been fatal but i can 
assure you that if we have a couple more of these it will be 
fatal said joseph firlit the plants chief executive officer 
plant spokesman kerry shearer says rancho seco has won praise 
from the nuclear regulatory commission for improvements since the 
1985 overcooling accident and claims that last years restart was 
one of the smoothest in the industry the nrc acknowledged the 
improvements by taking rancho seco off its list of 10 problem plants 
last december 
the agency had placed rancho seco on the list after the 
overcooling accident the most serious of the many woes that have 
plagued the 913megawatt plant 
federal investigators said a power outage to control room 
instruments and employee errors allowed the reactor vessel to cool 
180 degrees in 24 minutes well beyond the 100degreesperhour 
limit designed to prevent cracking of the steel vessel which could 
drain cooling water and trigger a meltdown 
the vessel didnt fracture but two workers were exposed to 
radiation and the plant vented radioactive steam over sacramento 
valley pastures 25 miles southeast of the capital 
the accident plunged the municipal utility into deficits led to 
the downgrading of its credit rating and led to a hike in rates to 
cover the increased cost of buying electricity from outside 
suppliers several managers were replaced as the utility struggled 
to convince regulators that the plant was safe enough to reopen 
the nrc said managers should have anticipated the accident 
because there had been similar failures of control systems at other 
plants constructed by the builders babcock amp wilcox inc the 
company also designed the three mile island reactor that had the 
nations most serious commerical nuclear accident in march 1979 
two months after rancho seco was restarted it barely survived a 
ballot initiative sponsored by critics to shut it permanently 
instead voters narrowly approved a measure sponsored by the 
utilitys publicly elected board to keep rancho seco open pending 
the second vote 
the measure also requires closure of the plant at any time 
beginning this year if it fails to operate at more than 50 percent 
capacity for four consecutive months that could be difficult for a 
plant thats generated an average of only 40 percent of its intended 
output of electricity since it was built 
the utility said it exceeded 50 percent in january which critics 
deny but theres no debate over february when rancho seco didnt 
generate a watt 
recent evaluations have been mixed a study by the institute of 
nuclear power operations uncovered unsafe working conditions 
management deficiencies equipment failures and inadequate training 
but it praised rancho seco for a reduction of administrative 
burdens and high morale and a positive attitude at all 
levels 
an nrc staff report has recommended a 100000 fine for 
violations from 1983 to 1986 including release of radioactive 
effluents plant officials said they would not oppose the fine and 
noted that the violations predated the overcooling accident and 
subsequent modifications

the federal government should extend the current 
limits on imported steel to avoid more dumping of the metal on us 
markets a leading steel industry executive says 
the current voluntary restraint agreement is to expire at the end 
of september and a fiveyear extension has been recommended to the 
bush administration 
without the renewal president thomas graham of usx corps uss 
division said monday overseas steel producers will invade the us 
market 
theres no doubt that foreign producers will revert to 
largescale dumping of heavily subsidized steel without a 
restraints renewal he said we certainly cant tolerate a return 
to past practices 
in the third quarter of 1984 shortly before the restraints 
began imported steel made up just more than 30 percent of the us 
market 
grahams comments came during the opening day of the weeklong 
annual congress of the society of automotive engineers 
he said the voluntary restraints renewal is essential if the us 
steel industry is to continue its twoyear financial recovery 
we cant afford to become giddy he said two years of 
profitability doesnt offset five years of losses 
graham said the us steel industry earned more than 2 billion 
in 1988 and about 900 million the year before but between 1982 and 
1986 the industry lost 12 billion an average of 24 billion 
annually 
the voluntary restraint agreement which began in 1984 limits 
the amount of imported finished steel to 185 percent of the us 
market among other things the american institute for imported 
steel said steel made overseas and shipped to the united states 
accounts for about 177 percent of the market below the current 
limit 
the imported steel association which supports an elimination of 
the restraints or a twoyear extension instead of five years has 
claimed that the limits reduce supply thereby increasing prices for 
us steel something the domestic steelmakers like 
but graham dismissed that contention 
its not an issue of protectionism he said its an issue 
of legal trading practices 
graham also said uss is prepared to file legal papers if the bush 
administration rejects a voluntary restraints extension 
we need enabling legislation from congress before the bush 
administration has the ability to act he said we see ourselves 
as prudent businessmen 
he declined to say when any legal moves may be taken adding that 
an earlier agreement barred the industry from filing trade 
litigation while a voluntary restraint was in effect

broadest measure of economic health advanced at its slowest pace 
since the final three months of 1986 it grew 38 percent in all of 
1988 
the slowdown in growth was accompanied by a pickup in one 
inflation measure the gnp deflator which measures a changing 
marketbasket of goods rose at an annual rate of 53 percent in the 
last quarter of the year that contrasted to an increase for all of 
1988 of just 34 percent 
the federal reserve last week launched another round of 
credittightening in an attempt to get inflation under control 
however critics contend that given the sluggish growth of the 
economy the higher interest rates are likely to topple the country 
into a recession 
the gnp estimate of 2 percent for the fourth quarter was 
unchanged from a report issued one month ago but the overall number 
masked a number of crosscurrents in different sectors of the 
economy 
consumer spending propelled by a hefty jump in spending for 
bigticket items such as cars rose by 35 percent in the final 
three months of the year almost one full percentage point above the 
previous estimate 
but this increase was offset by a quarterly trade deficit 94 
billion higher than the julyseptember period as a 77 percent jump 
in exports was swamped 13 percent rise in imports 
it marked the second consecutive quarterly widening of the trade 
deficit heightening fears that improvements in the trade gap have 
stalled out 
for the year the gnp rose by 38 percent the best annual 
performance since a 68 percent rise in 1984 the annual figure was 
unchanged from the initial estimate last month 
for 1989 the bush administration is counting on strong economic 
growth of 32 percent to generate higher government revenues and 
help to reduce the budget deficit without the need for a tax 
increase 
however many private forecasters are looking for a much smaller 
gnp increase this year and higher interest rates because of the 
federal reserve boards inflationfighting efforts 
those factors could well doom the bush administrations hopes of 
driving the budget deficit below 100 billion 
the 2 percent gnp increase for the fourth quarter followed a 25 
percent thirdquarter rise and was the slowest quarterly increase 
since a 14 percent rate in the final three months of 1986 
the fourth quarter figure was depressed by the lingering effects 
of last summers severe drought without the drought effects the 
economy would have expanded at a faster 31 percent rate 
the 53 percent rise in the gnp deflator which measures changing 
consumption patterns followed a thirdquarter increase of 47 
percent in the second quarter last year prices shot up at a 55 
percent rate 
there have been a rash of reports in recent weeks showing 
inflation is picking up momentum including government estimates 
that both wholesale and retail prices climbed sharply in january 
those reports triggered the federal reserve last week to tighten 
up further on credit including a boost last friday in the discount 
lending rate for financial institutions the most dramatic signal 
the fed can send of its intentions to push interest rates higher 
the central bank is attempting to engineer a soft landing in 
which growth slows enough to control inflation but the economy does 
not weaken so much that the country heads into a recession 
some economists said they were doubtful that the central bank 
would succeed 
we think the odds are moving towards a recession said david 
wyss an economist with data resources inc a lexington mass 
forecasting firm we are getting to a dangerous stage of the 
economic cycle the fed is trying to slow things down and it is very 
easy for the fed to overdo it 
wyss however said his firm still was not forecasting a 
recession predicting instead that the gnp will expand by 26 
percent this year 
that would be down from a 38 percent gnp growth rate for all of 
1988 the best performance since the economy surged ahead at a 68 
percent pace in 1984 
the bush administration has based its first budget on an 
assumption that the economy will expand by 32 percent this year 
while the higher growth makes it easier on paper for president bush 
to lower the budget deficit without raising taxes many private 
economists scoff at the administrations forecast 
they have also accused the administration of using unrealistic 
interest rate projections especially in light of the drive by the 
fed to tighten credit in an effort to slow borrowing demands 
the national association of business economists released a new 
quarterly survey on monday which pegged 1990 as the most likely year 
the next recession will start 
the economists for some of the countrys largest corporations 
predicted that economic growth for 1989 will slow to an annual rate 
of 27 percent but only one in five expected a recession to begin 
this year but 73 percent of the analysts said the economy will be 
in the soup by the end of 1990 
the business economists feel that this expansion is not at the 
end of its string yet we probably have another year or so to go

of new york

shamrock holdings inc has asked a 
delaware judge to prevent polaroids directors from exercising proxy 
rights on 300 million of preferred stock that polaroid sold last 
month to a friendly investment group 
shamrocks lawyers on monday also asked vice channcellor carolyn 
berger of the delaware chancery court to block the cambridge 
massbased companys 1125 billion stock buyback plan saying it 
would give management an unfair advantage in an imminent proxy 
battle 
berger took both arguments under advisement her rulings could 
have a major impact on the takeover and proxy battle being waged by 
shamrock a radio and television concern based in burbank calif 
polaroid has defended itself against shamrocks hostile 
45ashare takeover bid by offering 50 a share for 22 percent of 
its own stock polaroids offer expires march 20 which ensures that 
shares tendered by that date will be controlled by management at the 
may 9 annual meeting 
shamrock attorney michael rauch contended that polaroids tender 
offer should not be allowed before the meeting at which the 
companys entire board of directors is up for election 
rauch noted that polaroid previously issued close to 10 million 
shares to an employee stock ownership plan and sold more shares to 
corporate partners lp a new york investment group formed to aid 
companies warding off hostile suitors 
polaroid made a shortterm merger impossible by issuing 
stock rauch said now theyve stacked the deck by removing the 
one chance for stockholders to have a say at the annual meeting 
but polaroid attorney frederick schwartz said were performing 
our duty to the stockholders

eastern airlines and its machinists union were in 
federal court trading charges of contract violations as a friday 
strike deadline loomed ever closer 
eastern on monday asked a federal judge for permission to 
subcontract some repairs to catch up on a growing backlog the 
carrier also accused the machinists of engaging in illegal work 
slowdowns and refusing to accept mandatory overtime requests 
us district judge c clyde atkins ordered the machinists to 
prepare their response to the injunction request by today and said 
he would schedule a hearing shortly after listening to their 
testimony 
eastern said monday that 36000 manhours usually are enough to 
service four to six planes but union workers are now taking 97000 
hours increasing their backlog by almost 15 engines above the 
companys operating plan 
the machinists in turn have blamed eastern and frank lorenzo the 
chairman of easterns parent texas air corp for delays in putting 
planes back on line 
mr lorenzo has taken most of the newer aircraft from easterns 
fleet and put them over at continental airlines said union 
spokesman wally haber the ones we have over here are old ones 
that need a lot of work 
at a feb 17 hearing on the same issues atkins ordered the union 
to accept overtime while telling eastern to stop farming out its 
plane repairs eastern claims that the union has violated that 
order and wants to begin contracting out again 
on another front the machinists once again called on president 
bush to create an emergency board empowered to declare a 60day 
coolingoff period when the current one ends at midnight est friday 
we are in favor of a presidential emergency board haber 
said we look forward to putting our case before a third party 
eastern which estimates its losses at 1 million a day has 
opposed the board because it fears another extension will simply 
cost the carrier more money said spokesman robin matell

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
today that interest rates will remain high unless congress and the 
administration do a credible job of cutting the budget deficit 
the budget deficit must be brought down while it is beguiling 
to contemplate the healthy growth of recent years in the context of 
large budget deficits it is fanciful to conclude that these 
deficits have no adverse consequences greenspan told the senate 
budget committee 
allowing deficits to persist courts instability in the near 
term and threatens potentially significant reductions over time in 
the united states standard of living he said in his first 
congressional appearance since the fed boosted its key bank lending 
rate last friday 
the economy according to the feds reading is in danger of 
overheating retail price inflation at an alreadytoohigh 
44percent in 1987 and 1988 could ratchet higher because of tight 
labor markets and strained factory capacity fed officials believe 
greenspan said large budget deficits contribute to the 
inflation problem they tend to put inordinate strains on 
financial markets and they directly fuel excess demand on 
resources 
on friday the fed sent a dramatic signal of its intent to keep 
inflation under control by increasing its discount rate the 
interest charged member banks for shortterm loans from 65 percent 
to 7 percent the highest level in three years 
sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the budget panel called 
the increase an unmistakeable message to the president and the 
congress that we better put our fiscal affairs in order however 
he added i am afraid that the message is simply not being heard 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said the discount rate increase should be a wakeup 
call for both the administration and congress 
the feds antiinflation campaign has put it at odds with the 
bush administration which hopes to keep the deficit under control 
without raising taxes 
higher interest rates by adding to the cost of carrying the 27 
trillion national debt and by eventually slowing the economy make 
that more difficult 
both bushs budget and his plan to rescue the savings and loan 
industry depend on sharply falling interest rates and on saturday 
the president acknowledged i cant say im happy about the rise 
in interest rates 
bush says the threat of inflation is not as severe as the fed 
believes 
weve got a little difference of interpretation at this point 
as to how you read the indicators on inflation he said 
the presidents top economic spokesman treasury secretary 
nicholas f brady issued a statement late friday acknowledging that 
keeping inflation low is essential to sustaining the economic 
expansion but he did not back away from his statement to congress 
last week i dont see as strong evidence of inflation right now 
as does the federal reserve 
the economy according to the feds reading is in danger of 
overheating retail price inflation already at 44 percent in 1987 
and 1988 could ratchet higher because of tight labor markets and 
strained factory capacity fed officials believe 
congress and the president could relieve some of the pressure by 
quickly settling on a credible plan to whittle next years budget 
deficit from the current 165 billion to the 100 billion target of 
the grammrudman law that would lessen what many economists see as 
the inflationary stimulus of deficit spending 
so far that hasnt happened and the entire burden of managing 
the economy has fallen on the feds monetary policy the central 
bank has pushed shortterm interest rates up by 3 percentage points 
over the past year hoping to slow the economy without derailing the 
6yearold expansion 
however higher interest rates on everything from auto loans to 
adjustablerate mortgages inflict pain on american consumers and 
businesses and in response members of congress often complain that 
the independent central bank is squeezing too hard

morton thiokol inc manufacturer of the booster 
rockets which were blamed for the space shuttle challenger explosion 
three years ago says it plans to spin off its specialty chemical 
business from its troubled aerospace operation 
the plan approved by the board of directors and announced on 
monday would split morton thiokol into two companies thiokol inc 
the aerospace concern and morton international inc which would 
include the speciality chemicals airbags and salt businesses 
the transaction is expected to be finalized july 1 pending 
shareholders aproval according to company spokesman tom russell 
under the plan shareholders would receive a taxfree 
distribution of a share of morton international stock for each 
morton thiokol share the company said it believes the stock of both 
new companies will qualify for listing on the new york stock 
exchange 
russell said the planned spinoff had nothing to do with the 
challenger explosion 
morton thiokol manufactured the rocket boosters of the 
challenger which exploded shortly after takeoff on jan 28 1986 
killing the seven crew members investigators have blamed a failure 
in the boosters on the explosion 
morton thiokol has since redesigned the boosters correcting 
joint problems linked to the blast and they have been used 
successfully on two shuttle flights in recent months 
the shuttle program is in very good shape were very confident 
of redesign russell said 
morton thiokol chairman charles s locke said the spinoff will 
allow investors to evaluate better the individual businesses and 
their future outlook enhancing the likelihood that the true value 
of each business will be properly reflected 
wall street also appeared optimsitic about the plan morton 
thiokol rose 350 to 4350 in latemorning trading today on the 
nyse 
locke said the specialty chemicals company is expected to have 
fiscal 1989 assets of 14 billion and sales of 15 billion the 
aerospace business is expected to post 11 billion in sales this 
year and have assets of 800 million he said 
the company said that s jay stewart mortion thiokols president 
and chief operating officer is expected to be elected to those 
posts at morton international ed garrison group vice president for 
aerospace in ogden utah is expected to be elected president and 
chief operating officer of the aerospace company it said 
morton thiokol said special charges anticipated from the spinoff 
will reduce estimated net income to below the range of 340 to 
360 a share 
morton thiokols fiscal 1988 net income totaled 1453 million 
or 304 a share on sales of 232 billion

wild swings in stock prices harm the economy 
speakers said at a conference today while disagreeing on whether 
wall street is part of the solution or part of the problem 
experts at the twoday forum on technology and its role in the 
financial markets are exploring how to give the markets 
computerdriven efficiency without courting computerdriven disaster 
as exchanges move toward 24hour worldwide trading and install 
everfaster computers the experts want to make sure electronic 
trading systems do not overwhelm the people who are supposed to 
control them 
one concern is the wild price swings that have occurred 
periodically in the stock market partly due to computerized trading 
programs that can rapidly buy or sell millions of shares as part of 
speculative strategies 
lawrence h summers a harvard university economist said harmful 
speculation could be reduced by a tax on securities trades 
but louis i margolis a managing director of the wall street 
investment firm salomon brothers inc said a better answer would be 
a return to fixed commissions for brokers 
the proposals came on the second and main day of the forum which 
was sponsored by the annenberg washington program and northwestern 
universitys kellogg graduate school of management 
acknowledging that investors are unlikely to tolerate going back 
to fixed brokerage fees salomons margolis said an alternative 
would be to free brokerage firms from some of their remaining 
constraints 
brokerage firms are hamstrung today unable to stabilize the 
markets by coming in to buy stocks when prices fall steeply 
margolis said 
we are coming along to a liquidity crisis in the stock 
market margolis said 
weve seen the traditional swings between optimism and 
pessimism compressed into very short periods of time he said 
but summers said the best way to deal with the chaotic price 
swings would be to discourage shortterm trading 
the forum featured sessions with federal regulators academics 
and leaders of several major exchanges 
among the observers are representatives of the congressional 
office of technology assessment which is in the middle of its own 
18month study of technologys impact on the financial markets 
this one sounds very much like a condensed version of our own 
study vary coates who is directing the congressional study said 
monday 
technology was partly blamed for the oct 19 1987 stock market 
crash several investigators said the disaster was worsened by 
portfolio insurance a computerized strategy of selling securities 
into a declining market 
some also blamed wild price gyrations during the crash on index 
arbitrage a computerized trading strategy for profiting on price 
gaps between stocks traded in new york and the underlying 
stockindex futures traded in chicago 
more recently though technology has been put forward as a 
solution to the alleged abuses in the chicago trading pits where 
futures and options are traded by chaotic open outcry 
using computers to match buyers and sellers in chicago would 
break the hold of floor traders who are accused of excluding 
outsiders and making private deals that disadvantage customers 
advocates of computerization say 
the problem for reformers is that computerization can challenge 
some politically powerful interests in chicago the floor traders 
and in new york the specialists who make a market in particular 
stocks 
the 1987 stock market crash convinced the exchanges that they 
needed to do a better job of computerizing the unglamorous but 
essential back offices where questioned trades are settled and 
cleared meaning the money and securities change hands 
everyone has concentrated on frontend systems that is the 
execution side of it they have not concentrated that closely on the 
riskmanagement side said john wall an executive vice president 
at the national association of securities dealers 
in the 1987 crash turmoil in the back offices was so great that 
major banks were unwilling to make emergency loans to securities 
firms because they werent confident that adequate collateral 
existed for the loans the crisis ended when the federal reserve 
injected massive reserves into the system and strongarmed the banks 
maybe people at least in the financial sector may have gone 
too far and allowed too much automation without checks and 
balances said paul f glaser chairman of the corporate 
technology committee of citicorp 
nevertheless glaser said he continues to believe that technology 
can reduce risk in the financial markets first of all you cant 
go back he said youve got to deal with it

editors note americas love affair with the robot apparently 
has gone sour orders for the mechanical marvels have been on the 
decline in recent years after reaching a peak in 1984 one reason 
is robots are still pretty dumb and corporations are hesitant to 
invest large amounts of money to develop smarter models 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
scientists in the 1950s proclaimed the robot 
the wave of the future it would free housewives of drudgery and 
fill factories with a tireless steelcollar work force but in many 
ways the wave has been a washout 
robots can paint cars salvage nuclear fuel and even assist in 
brain surgery but theyre still pretty dumb and they are far from 
the science fiction promise of comic books and movies 
robots now are significantly better than 30 years ago but that 
doesnt necessarily mean we are anywhere close to an r2d2 or 
c3po says raj reddy director of the robotics institute at 
carnegie mellon university referring to the robot characters in the 
movie star wars 
orders for americanmade robots have been falling since their 
peak of 501 million in 1984 according to the robotics industries 
association 
experts say automating a factory is more complicated than just 
buying a robot and putting it on the assembly line in addition 
they say some industrial robots are too complicated and prone to 
failure and when they do work they dont always fit in with 
factory operations 
about 33000 robots work in the united states mostly in 
manufacturing with automakers buying at least 40 percent says 
robots association spokesman jeffrey a burnstein 
its not a revolution its an evolution burnstein says 
robots are another new productive technology in the same way that 
computers were 
japan is the worlds leading robot user followed by the united 
states west germany and france 
robots are still dumb reddy says theyre dumb because we 
havent taken the trouble to put the pieces together not because we 
dont know how that takes money and time and effort and we dont 
have the money 
but todays robots can 
see they dont see like humans but they can recognize forms 
and shapes and measure distances through sonar ranging devices and 
lasers 
hear and speak they use computers that recognize thousands of 
words 
smell their sensors can detect smoke or fumes 
move they most often roll on wheels but some models hop on one 
leg and others walk with as many as eight legs ambling like a 
spider on uneven terrain 
touch they can recognize texture and the force of a movement 
such as pressing 
many robots have one or two of these abilities to some degree 
but creating a competent robot that combines most or all of them has 
been difficult 
in addition scientists have found its difficult to match human 
abilities that most people take for granted such as the dexterity 
of a finger or the ability to identify objects 
the rule of thumb is that if you think the job is easy then 
its usually difficult says takeo kanade codirector of the 
carnegie mellon institute the list of things that robots can do 
better than humans is much much shorter than the list of things 
robots cannot 
industrial robots can perform many tedious tasks with precision 
including welding assembling painting packaging and loading yet 
burnstein estimates that less than 5 percent of american companies 
have installed even one robot 
japanese companies which have installed more than twice as many 
robots as american companies have been more willing to invest in 
robots that take years to pay for themselves burnstein says 
robots are very expensive to make and they can do very 
little says hans moravec senior research scientist at carnegie 
mellon its hard to find a job for them that actually pays off 
moravec says the industrial robot is about as smart as an insect 
the robots working on the assembly line today might well be 
compared to spiders he says they do their jobs competently 
but its a narrow job 
industrial robots often shut down when even the slightest thing 
goes wrong forcing humans to their aid says donald michie chief 
scientist of the turing institute of glasgow scotland which 
conducts research into artificial intelligence

michie is trying to develop computers that learn from experience 
a technology that could result in robots that adjust to changing 
circumstances and learn from mistakes 
moravec believes technology will enable robots to have humanlike 
intelligence in about 50 years 
service robots a new breed are moving off the factory floor to 
handle work in hazardous environments help the disabled or just 
sweep floors underwater robots are examining lake bottoms and doing 
risky deepsea work 
doctors at memorial medical center of long beach calif have 
performed more than 35 brain operations with the help of a robot arm 
that guides surgeons as they drill into the skull 
research is under way at carnegie mellon on a sixlegged robot to 
explore the surface of mars in the next decade and on a car that can 
drive itself university researchers also made robots to remove 
radioactive waste from the crippled three mile island nuclear plant 
near harrisburg 
kg engelhardt director of the universitys health and human 
services lab is developing a robotic work station that allows the 
disabled especially those without the use of their hands to work 
in an office the station should be marketed by the end of the year 
selling for less than 50000 she says 
tish pferdehirt 44 a vocational rehabilitation counselor in 
pittsburgh helps test the station with paralyzed legs and only 
limited use of her arms she knows firsthand the benefits of such a 
helpmate 
it does all kinds of things from getting a book off a shelf for 
me to turning off a radio to picking up a file and putting it in 
an inout box she says 
the work station has an arm that turns bends and swivels as ms 
pferdehirt speaks commands into a microphone it fetches things 
looks up telephone numbers and dials the phone 
ms engelhardt hopes to make the robot work on projects 
independently such as shredding paper when she is not there thus 
making it more valuable 
joseph f engelberger has big corporate backers for his service 
robots 
projects in the works at engelbergers transitions research corp 
of danbury conn include development of robots that will sweep or 
scrub floors in airports or supermarkets and fetch drugs for 
pharmacists in mailorder warehouses 
another engelberger robot is helpmate a nurses aide that 
delivers meals to hospital patients and makes other deliveries such 
as taking a urine specimen to a lab 
helpmate designed to use elevators and negotiate hallways as it 
moves by itself on wheels is being tested and engelberger said it 
will go on sale for 40000 by years end 
engelberger hopes to get corporate backing to build his dream 
robot a 50000 household helper that would prepare light meals 
clean house and clear snow but he cant figure out how to teach it 
to make beds 
he estimates it would take up to 14 million and 2 years to 
develop but american companies so far have been unwilling to make 
the initial investment 
engelberger helped pioneer an industrial robot more than 30 years 
ago but the history of the automaton goes back farther 
the whole idea of building a mechanical man is fairly old 
moravec says there were clockwork automatons built by swiss and 
french clocksmiths in the 18th century and 17th century 
the term robotics was coined in 1942 in a science fiction story 
by isaac asimov from the word robot which was coined in 1921 by 
czech playwright karel capek 
in 1954 american inventor george devol filed a patent for a 
programmable robot arm whose movement was controlled by punched 
program cards in 1958 devol and engelberger formed a company to 
build the machines 
their first industrial robot was installed in 1961 in a general 
motors corp plant 
engelberger says visions in the 1950s of a robotfilled world 
fizzled when the promises outran technology 
everything was supposed to become automated he says it 
was all blue sky but the technology wasnt available the 
technology is just becoming available but i have a difficult time 
convincing people we can do it today

senate majority leader george mitchell told 
governors concerned about the budget today that congress and the 
president have got to summon the resolve to achieve significant 
reductions in the federal deficit this year 
facing questioning about the nations fiscal insanity at a 
gathering of the nations governors mitchell dmaine said he had 
just left a meeting with president bush where they reaffirmed this 
morning our commitment to a cooperative effort on the budget and 
other areas 
the situation has reached a stage that is so critical the 
events of recent weeks increases in interest rates threaten us 
with being just consumed with interest payments on the debt that 
weve got to summon the resolve to do it mitchell said 
he addressed the final session of the national governors 
association annual winter meeting which heard from congressional 
leaders and administration officials that they should expect no 
financial help from washington because of the crisis posed by the 
federal deficit 
democratic gov cecil andrus of idaho said the fiscal insanity 
that presently prevails over this city is the overriding problem 
facing each of the governors he asked mitchell what congress would 
do 
the senate leader responded that he believed congress has the 
will to act on the deficit but cannot act without the president he 
said bush has strongly held views in many areas an apparent 
reference to the presidents flat opposition to tax increases 
mitchell said the governors like other americans hold 
conflicting views that complicate a budget answer 
youve got a number of policy statements here governor that 
call for increased federal spending and yet another one that 
calls for meaningful deficit reduction he said referring to the 
policy statements of the bipartisan governors association 
transportation secretary samuel skinner and sen brock adams 
dwash who held that job in the carter administration told the 
governors monday to expect congressional deficit fighters to crowd 
out a traditional source of state revenues by attempting an increase 
in the federal tax on gasoline 
there is significant pressure in the house for such a gas tax 
for deficit reduction as well as the senate skinner said i 
would not assume or take for granted it will not be successful 
the federal government currently levies a 9 cents per gallon tax 
on gasoline and it is often eyed as a source of more money adams 
said that for each penny it is raised 1 billion in revenue is 
collected 
but states levy taxes on fuel for their own transportation 
spending and governors in both parties say any increase in the 
federal tax makes it more difficult for the states to raise their 
own gasoline taxes 
gov james thompson rill said the governors would ask for the 
federal government to promise to turn some of the revenue over to 
the states if the gas tax is increased for transportation needs he 
said he would oppose a gas tax increase for nontransportation 
purposes 
the governors conducted their meeting which began on saturday 
with few displays of partisanship as they sought to hear from 
congressional leaders and top officials of the bush administration 
on the outlook for the budget and what it means for the states 
the message they heard was generally simple dont expect much 
financial help from the federal government because of the budget 
deficit 
senate budget committe chairman james sasser dtenn offered 
that message in a session on sunday and skinner offered the 
administrations version on monday in reference to the governors 
requests for more federal spending on highways bridges and other 
transportation needs 
i see no sentiment whatsoever for a salvation from washington 
for the infrastructure problems of this nation skinner said 
he said the governors should expect a greater share of the burden 
for transportation needs to shift to the states 
governors have been seeking the release of more money from the 
federal highway trust fund and gov henry bellmon rokla said 
wed like to have our slice of that trust fund the sooner the 
better 
but skinner said much of the money on hand is already obligated 
for future spending there is not a potload of money thats 
going to be available for the future he said 
gov neil goldschmidt dore like adams a former transportation 
secretary said transportation needs warrant increased federal 
spending there are really some infrastructure problems in this 
country that are keeping us from being competitive he said

a group of aviation industry and government 
safety experts recommended today 800 million worth of mandatory 
work on older airliners to ensure safety of the nations aging 
airliner fleet 
the unprecedented program if adopted by the federal aviation 
administration would affect more than 1300 early boeing 747 737 
and 727 models at a cost of over 600000 each 
the aging aircraft task forces working group on older boeing 
airliners drew up its final recommendations this morning just prior 
to a news conference releasing the details the air transport 
association which represents major airlines organized the task 
force 
clyde kizer an ata vice president said none of the recommended 
work which would involve planes flown by foreign carriers as well 
as us airlines was considered urgent there are no dangerous 
aircraft out there flying right now he told reporters 
representatives of delta and united who also participated in the 
news conference said much of the work had already been done on 
their airliners and they anticipated no immeidate large expenses 
some other major airlines also have made many of the changes 
recommended by the task force 
widescale modification or replacement of structural material 
fittings and skin are being recommended on the basis of service 
experience said a final draft of the report which follows nine 
months of meetings and examination of more than 700 service 
bulletins issued by boeing 
the recommendations adopt 150 of the bulletins and consolidate 
them into the form of one massive service bulletin to be issued by 
boeing and presented to the faa for possible adoption as an 
airworthiness directive 
the difference in a manufacturers bulletin and an faa 
airworthiness directive is that faa orders are mandatory airliner 
operators will be given varying times to accomplish the changes 
based on the amount of service an aircraft has had 
other groups from the task force are looking at service 
recommendations affecting mcdonnell douglas dc9s dc8s and dc10s 
and airliners manufactured abroad to see what modifications will be 
needed to maintain their safety results of their work are expected 
before the end of the year 
the average age of the nearly 3000 us airliners is about 13 
years with half the planes in many major airlines fleets well over 
15 years old according to avmark an appraisal and consulting firm 
the task force recommendations if adopted by the faa would be a 
departure from a system that has relied primarily on inspection 
orders with repairs made subsequently when needed 
among the 150 participants on the task force are the faa 
representatives of major airlines belonging to the air transport 
association professional airline mechanics organizations foreign 
airlines and regulatory bodies and the national aeronautics and 
space administration 
both boeing and mcdonnell douglas along with several airlines 
and the faa have been examining the problems of the aging 
international airliner fleet but this is the first time government 
and industry have gotten together on such a large scale to tackle 
the issue 
boeing head f a shrontz said in washington last week that his 
companys airliners are built to last forever if properly maintained 
old airliners are rarely scrapped because low aviation fuel 
prices steadily increasing air travel the high cost of new 
airliners and other factors have boosted the demand for old 
airliners and their value 
but airport noise reduction requirements and incidents of holes 
ripping open in fuselages and of wheels and engines falling off of 
older planes are putting increased pressure on airlines to phase out 
their oldest models 
some airline critics have suggested that whole classes of 
airliners be scrapped or that airliners be taken out of service 
after a set number of flying hours or takeoffs and landings 
aviation experts say that the chronological age of an airliner 
has less effect on its overall value and safety than other factors 
such as the number of times its cabin is pressurized and 
depressurized the quality of the airlines maintenance program and 
the environment in which it is flown 
increased concern over aging airliners was prompted by an april 
1988 incident in which the top of the passenger compartment in an 
aloha 737 ripped off over hawaii a stewardess was killed in the 
incident 
the recommendations came four days after a hole ripped open in 
united air lines oldest 747 sending nine passengers hurling to 
their deaths 17 minutes after takeoff from honolulu but 
investigators in that incident said they found no signs of metal 
fatigue that is often a factor in damage to older airliners and were 
focusing on the possibility of a faulty cargo door

general motors corp said tuesday it will spend 
975 million to buy blocks of stock from the howard hughes medical 
institute to settle a dispute stemming from the automakers 1985 
purchase of hughes aircraft co 
the institute a philanthropic organization founded by the late 
billionaire recluse had complained to gm officials that it wasnt 
satisifed with the performance of gms class h common stock 
gm said it would pay 675 million in cash and 300 million in 
notes to buy 35 million shares of the stock which was created to 
help finance the 52 billion purchase of hughes aircraft in june 
1985 
the medical institute now owns 995 million or about 78 percent 
of the outstanding shares of gm class h stock 
the agreement resolves a dispute that went to arbitration late 
last year gm treasurer leon krain refused to disclose the reasons 
for the arbitration which kicked in under terms of the 1985 hughes 
deal 
gm reportedly was seeking a rebate on what it paid for hughes 
because the company lost some defense department contracts it had 
before the purchase was made 
the institute in december complained about light trading of the 
class h stock which made up the bulk of its assets and that the 
price of the shares appeared mainly tied to a 30ashare price 
guarantee 
when hughes aircraft became gm hughes electronics corp the 
automaker promised to pay the institute the difference between 30 a 
share and the average price for class h stock during the last 
quarter of 1989 that provision was canceled by the agreement 
the new agreement calls for a series of stock purchase and sell 
options for gm and the institute from 1991 to 1995 if all are 
exercised the medical institute would hold about 95 million 
shares or 75 percent of the outstanding class h stock 
the agreement requires that the institute hold its class h stock 
until each option deadline passes 
gm chairman roger b smith said the company which has reported 
that it has 68 billion in cash on hand could afford the stock 
purchase plans called for in the agreement he said the agreement 
will provide the institute with cash liquidity it had sought 
bob potter spokesman for the bethesda mdbased medical 
institute said the 675 million in cash go into an investment fund 
the remaining 300 million is to be split between two notes 
money generated from the investment fund will go to a variety of 
projects including medical research potter said in a statement 
institute chairman george thorn said the money will allow better 
planning of research and other capital expenditure programs

president bushs point man on the savings 
and loan crisis urged a group representing smaller banks tuesday to 
enthusiastically support the administrations plan for rescuing the 
thrift industry even though they may have reservations about some 
aspects 
richard c breeden who oversaw drafting of the presidents plan 
told a meeting of the independent bankers association of america 
that quibbling over details of the plan could dangerously delay 
urgently needed action 
the administration has estimated the cost of rescuing insolvent 
or teetering sampls at 90 billion and the weak onethird of the 
industry is losing money at the rate of 40 million a day 
at 40 million a day we shouldnt launch into a sixmonth 
debate breeden told the bankers meeting at the anaheim hilton 
hotel we simply have a huge problem and we simply have to get on 
with it 
the president has proposed spending 399 billion of tax money 
over the next decade to finance the bailout additionally savings 
and loans and to a lesser extent banks would pay more for their 
federal deposit insurance 
members of the independent bankers group which represents 
community banks with assets of 100 million or less have objected 
that higher insurance premiums would place a disproportionate burden 
on them 
they also have complained that the presidents plan does little 
to remedy what they see as inequities between regulation of their 
industry and the credit unions with which they compete 
one aspect of the plan that has drawn little opposition is the 
presidents proposal that federal regulators should rein in what 
many see as overly aggressive management in the thrift industry 
under the bush plan the federal home loan bank board which 
oversees the sampl business would be placed under control of the 
treasury as has long been the case with bank regulation 
critical decisions of the bank board over the last decade 
concerning capital adequacy capital averaging accounting rules 
chartering standards and other areas of thrift supervision do not 
seem to have adequately protected the public marketplace and the 
taxpayers breeden said 
as a result we must instill accountability at the top to help

soybean oil futures prices surged mightily tuesday on the chicago 
board of trade in a late rally apparently incited by technical 
market analyses that signaled buying opportunities despite a serious 
oversupply 
other grain and soybean futures also advanced while precious 
metals energy and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
soybean oil settled 20 cents to 57 cents higher with the contract 
for delivery in march at 2320 for 100 pounds 
the runup in the last 20 minutes of trading surprised analysts 
who had been watching the soybean and soybean meal markets lead the 
grain markets higher for most of the day 
soybean oil had opened lower in reaction to the mornings posting 
of a higherthanexpected number of notices of intent to deliver 
soybean oil against the march contract that initially was seen as 
bearish but prices didnt fall so many traders took it as a signal 
to purchase soybean oil instead 
later in the session some buying began to accumulate and that 
fed on itself and we had a big surge in the end said walter 
spilka a market analyst in new york with smith barney harris upham 
amp co the market put on one of its best performances since the 
summer 
the rally came despite what analysts call overwhelmingly negative 
supplydemand fundamentals for soybean oil with stockpiles up and 
demand relatively sluggish 
its extremely overpriced on world markets said analyst 
cathy leow of thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york 
but analysts agreed the technical signals generated by 
mathematical analysis of the markets recent price movements have 
improved and may have sparked the rally 
soybean and soybean meal futures settled mostly higher paced by 
gains in prices of soybeans to come from this summers crop 
wheat and corn futures were supported by an improving export 
picture including the agriculture departments offer late monday to 
subsidize sales of 2 million metric tons of wheat to china 
the usda said after tuesdays close that it hoped iraq would 
purchase 1 million metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices 
wheat settled unchanged to 3 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in march at 436 a bushel corn was 1 cent to 2 cents 
higher with march at 272 a bushel oats were 4 cents to 5 cents 
higher with march at 204 a bushel soybeans were 5 cents to 10 
cents higher with march at 762 a bushel 
gold futures inched higher while silver declined slightly in 
lackluster trading on new yorks commodity exchange 
gold settled 20 cents to 60 cents higher with april at 39040 a 
troy ounce silver was 21 cents to 39 cents lower with march at 
5824 cents a troy ounce 
crude oil futures gained marginally but refined products ended 
mixed on the new york mercantile exchange 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 9 cents 
higher with april at 1815 a barrel heating oil was 20 cent lower 
to 12 cent higher with march at 5245 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 47 cent lower to 14 cent higher with march at 5081 
cents a gallon 
cattle futures settled mostly higher on the chicago mercantile 
exchange although nearmonth contracts for both live and feeder 
cattle declined on speculative profittaking pork futures were 
narrowly mixed 
live cattle were 10 cent lower to 30 cent higher with april at 
7805 cents a pound feeder cattle were 12 cent lower to 33 cent 
higher with march at 8280 cents a pound live hogs were 08 cent 
lower to 30 cent higher with april at 4372 cents a pound frozen

congress should tax stock trading to discourage 
socially wasteful financial speculation a harvard university 
economist argued in a tuesday speech but a wall street executive 
said such a policy could increase the chance of sharp price declines 
economist lawrence h summers a top economic adviser to the 
democratic presidential campaign of michael dukakis said 
unproductive shortterm trading had helped the financial industry 
grow out of proportion to economic sectors that produce food cars 
and other useful products 
the tax proposal made during a conference on financial market 
technology reflects sentiment against speculation that has been 
gathering strength in washington as well as academic and corporate 
circles he said 
summers said for example that treasury secretary nicholas 
brady a former wall street executive has indicated he was 
committed to reduce incentives that make companies focus on 
quarterly profits to appease shortterm investors and concurrently 
create greater opportunities for speculation 
but louis i margolis a managing director of salomon brothers 
inc said summers proposed tax on stock trades would make sharp 
price declines likelier by reducing the number of investors who 
would be willing to buy a falling stock 
we are coming along to a liquidity crisis in the stock 
market margolis said 
weve seen the traditional swings between optimism and 
pessimism compressed into very short periods of time he said 
the debate came on the second and main day of a forum sponsored 
by the annenberg washington program and northwestern universitys 
kellogg graduate school of management 
in addition to political issues the conference dealt with how to 
manage computers and highspeed communications so that they make the 
markets more efficient without making them vulnerable to cataclysms 
like the october 1987 stock market crash 
the threat of japanese competition accounts for the urgency of 
american efforts to improve the speed and efficiency of the markets 
william brodsky the president of the chicago mercantile exchange 
said in an afternoon session 
japan is probably the most important reason the chicago merc 
has developed a 24hour global electronic trading system in 
cooperation with reuters holdings plc brodsky said 
japan is a competitive threat for us in futures just as they 
are in semiconductors automobiles and other things he said 
the merc intends to preserve its open outcry trading system 
during regular hours even after adopting an electronic system for 
off hours brodsky said in a session following the faceoff between 
summers and his critics 
summers said a tax of 05 percent on stock trades would raise 
about 10 billion a year and would be small enough to discourage 
only the major market players who he said contribute to sharp swings 
in stock prices 
he said bond trading also be could taxed perhaps at a lower 
rate other countries including britain and japan tax transactions 
so a tax would be unlikely to drive business offshore he said 
salomons margolis said a better solution than taxation for 
curbing speculation would be a return to fixed commissions for 
brokers 
he said big wall street houses that traditionally helped 
stabilize markets by absorbing dumped stock are already shrinking 
their brokerage businesses because commissions are too small to be 
worthwhile 
acknowledging that investors would not likely tolerate going back 
to fixed commissions margolis said an alternative would be to free 
brokerage firms from certain current regulatory constraints 
wall street firms should be freed to trade oddsized bundles of 
stocks and to make free use of the chicago stock options market to 
hedge their portfolios margolis said 
princeton university economist sanford grossman also criticized 
the proposed trading tax grossman said it was unfair to single out 
the securities industry for a tax and said there was no evidence 
that the financial markets were excessively volatile

the stock market rose tuesday in what analysts 
described as a reflex response to last weeks sharp decline 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 803 points to 
225839 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
911 up 531 down and 516 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the big board totaled 14743 million 
shares up from 13990 million in mondays session 
its kind of a physical kneejerk pop said larry wachtel 
an analyst for prudentialbache securities inc 
marketwatchers cautioned against attaching undue significance to 
a pair of government economic reports released tuesday since they 
referred to a past period 
the commerce department reported that the economy grew at a 
sluggish annual rate of 2 percent in the final three months of 1988 
as the worst deterioration in the trade deficit in more than two 
years offset unexpected strength in consumer spending 
the trade shortfall climbed to 32 billion in the period as both 
us exports and imports hit record levels 
i wouldnt read too much into this whole thing said michael 
metz an analyst for oppenheimer amp co they stock traders are 
almost looking for an excuse to rally 
despite the news of sluggish growth in the fourth quarter the 
markets underlying anxiety about inflation persists analysts said 
that concern was a big factor in last weeks slide which hammered 
the dow jones average down 7928 points 
wall street sniffed at congressional testimony tuesday by federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan who warned that interest rates will 
remain high unless congress and the administration do a credible job 
of cutting the budget deficit 
the fed chairman has appeared on capitol hill numerous times in 
the past week or so and market participants seem to have grown 
blase about his statements 
they sort of brushed right by that said bob otoole manager 
of overthecounter trading at shearson lehman hutton inc

the store sound system played dont 
worry be happy managers maneuvered via walkietalkie and 
hundreds of workers armed with price tag guns scrambled through a 
closed sears store tuesday to remake the image of the nations 
biggest retailer 
in columbus as elsewhere sears roebuck and co stores closed 
their doors to undergo the nuts and bolts work demanded by the 
companys new retailing strategy for attracting more customers 
by reopening time at noon wednesday workers nationwide were to 
have rolled back prices on 50000 items representing an estimated 
15 billion pieces of merchandise in more than 820 stores in 
addition to changing signs taking inventory and cleaning up 
the worst was the screwdrivers said chris skinner a 
brookhaven high school freshman who spent much of the day repricing 
baby booties and toddlers dresses you had to take them all down 
clean each one by hand then put them all back 
the cash register rings about 3000 times a day in the 
100000squarefoot store but the only sound wednesday was the 
clicking of pricing guns and muffled sounds of store officials 
keeping in touch via 15 walkietalkies 
about 100 high school students worked for 5 an hour to help 
company officials in shirt sleeves and scores of others with the 
changeover 
its the most exciting thing ive ever been involved in in 
sears said bob dumas manager of the northland mall store and a 
30year sears employee 
its no longer that old sea of yellow he said referring to 
sears old yellowwithblacklettering sale signs many new signs 
touting sears new lower pricing policy are red and blue although 
in apparel they are magenta and gray 
at the northland store 700 workers scrambled to the tune of 
dont worry be happy as they marked down items such as a twin 
canopy bed from 26999 to 9900 a diehard automobile battery is 
now 64 instead of 72 and a craftsman power drill is now 3262 
instead of 5999 
sears new strategy meant reductions on 75 percent of its own 
brands and 1000 other brand names it now carries 
i dont think they had any choice they lost their customer 
base said karen sacks an analyst with standard and poors corp 
in new york i think wednesday will be a madhouse at sears but 
will they be able to reeducate their customers not to come in just 
for a sale 
mens department manager marilyn stone said they would 
our customers are aleady asking about the changes she said 
adding that the company has more brands better quality and fewer 
items that are 100 percent polyester 
monroe greenstein analyst with the investment firm bear stearns 
in new york said the strategy paid off in wichita kan where 
sales rose 15 percent when sears tested the idea was last fall 
and sears will invest in an advertising campaign that to not 
hear about it you would practically have to be comatose 
greenstein said 
columbus managers dressed in work clothes distributed 700 rolls 
of pricing gun tape enough to make about 350000 new tags and 
handed out 30000 new signs including some that hang from ceilings 
and those to be placed on bins of hardware 
workers dusted off palm trees that hovered alongside sparkling 
racks of tropical preteen apparel and pulled washers and dryers 
from their places to repaint the walls and changed the price tags on 
lightbulbs 
new displays featured new brands that sears will offer 
display supervisor todd skeie said the displays were looser 
and livelier than they ever have been he said better products 
and being allowed to display items above the cornice on the wall for 
the first time improved the stores looks 
you should always keep up with the times said employee karen 
jackson you dont want to be in the back seat forever

the supreme court in a victory for trans world 
airlines ruled tuesday that railroads and airlines may penalize 
strikers by giving their jobs to employees with less seniority who 
stay on the job or return to work before the strike ends 
in a separate rulings the court also made it easier for the 
united states to turn over tax records to foreign governments 
the twa ruling allows more than 1220 new flight attendants hired 
during a 1986 strike by the independent federation of flight 
attendants to keep their jobs but fails to reinstate more than 2000 
former striking attendants who demanded their jobs back 
justice william j brennan denounced the 63 ruling saying it 
is inherently destructive of the right to strike and that it 
favors socalled crossover workers those who cross picket lines 
but justice sandra day oconnor writing for the majority said 
such a policy of encouraging prestrike workers to remain on the 
job during the strike or to abandon the strike and return to work 
before all vacancies were filled is a legitimate exercise of 
twas peaceful economic power 
the ruling is based on an interpretation of the federal railway 
labor act which also governs airlines 
in the tax case which involved a 1942 tax treaty with canada 
the supreme court granted canadian officials access to the financial 
records of two of its citizens with bank accounts in washington 
state 
in the 90 decision the supreme court said a federal law aimed 
at protecting criminal suspects who also are being investigated by 
the internal revenue service does not apply to tax probes by foreign 
governments 
in 1987 the 9th us court of appeals had blocked an effort by 
the irs to obtain records of philip stuart and mons kapoor on behalf 
of the canadian department of national revenue canadas dnr the 
equivalent of the irs had requested the documents under the tax 
treaty providing for exchange of information between the two nations 
us government officials had criticized the appeals ruling 
saying it could affect us treaty obligations with several foreign 
governments and impair the ability of us investigators to obtain 
foreign financial records 
the twa case stemmed from a dispute between the airline and the 
iffa who called a strike on march 7 1986 after contract 
negotiations broke down the previous contract had expired july 31 
1984 
twa hired the new flight attendants after the strike began in 
addition some 1280 twa flight attendants crossed picket lines 
either at the outset of the walkout or as the strike continued for 
more than two months 
after the strike ended the union filed a federal lawsuit 
charging twa with illegally refusing to reinstate more than 2000 
striking workers 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled in 1987 that striking 
flight attendants were entitled to their old jobs at the expense of 
less senior flight attendants who had crossed the picket lines 
oconnor said that preferential treatment for crossovers does 
not violate seniority protections because workers who stayed out on 
strike but were reinstated after the walkout ended retain their 
seniority rights over crossovers with less seniority

department store chain john wanamaker has 
been ordered to pay 90000 and subject its credit process to future 
review to settle a federal complaint that it discriminated against 
female credit applicants 
the government claimed wanamaker violated the equal credit 
opportunity act by approving or denying credit applications of 
married couples based solely on the credit histories of husbands 
this is the first time that we have brought a case that 
involved a complaint that womenwho had perfectly good credit 
histories but were denied credit because wanamakers only checked 
their husbands ratings said jean noonan the federal trade 
commissions associate director for credit practices 
the agreement was part of a consent decree and other documents 
filed monday in us district court attorneys for the ftc said 
wanamaker had been discriminating against women seeking credit since 
1977 
wanamaker agreed to comply with federal statutes governing equal 
credit opportunity and allow the government to monitor its 
performance for three years 
lawrence mcdade assistant director of the justice departments 
office of consumer litigation said if a husband had a bad credit 
record but his wifes credit history was good credit would be 
denied 
it wasnt based on legitimate objective criteria mcdade 
said it was based on sex 
john wanamaker which is owned by woodward amp lothrop department 
stores of washington runs 15 stores with annual sales of about 410 
million and more than 700000 creditcard holders 
woodward amp lothrop said the ftcs complaint involved credit 
practices at wanamaker that preceded its acquisition of the chain in 
late 1986 
penalties for violations of the equal credit opportunity act can 
run higher than 200000 noonan said the 90000 fine is around 
the middle range 
wanamaker must pay the fine within 10 days it also must report 
to the ftc within 60 days on how it is complying with the equal 
credit opportunity act 
in addition wanamaker must submit to the ftc a random sample of 
up to 2000 credit applications that have been approved rejected or 
withdrawn within the prior 12 months and make available upon 
request all applications filed during the next 25 months

two of the nations biggest 
business groups on tuesday announced they no longer will comply with 
voluntary wage and price guidelines imposed last august to hold down 
inflation 
leaders of the argentine industrial union and the argentine 
chamber of commerce said they withdrew from the official committee 
on prices and supplies because of the governments inability to 
control interest rates that last week neared 40 percent a month 
inflation in january was 89 percent or nearly twice what the 
economy ministry projected a month earlier inflation for february 
was projected to be 10 percent or greater 
todaywe repeat the request for policies that reverse the 
strong recessive process and normalize the financial system in order 
to end interest rates that aredestroying production the 
industrial union said in a communique 
the chamber of commerce withdrawal followed a meeting of its 
executive board chaired by president carlos de la vega 
the socalled spring plan of voluntary price and wage 
guidelines and low increases in the cost of public services was 
implemented seven months ago following a 256 increase in july 
inflation 
organized labor particularly the four millionmember general 
labor confederation complained it was not represented on the price 
committee and that workers were losing purchasing power because 
wages were not keeping pace with price increases 
this week mail carriers teachers train personnel court clerks 
and others threatened to strike if they were not granted wage 
increases above the voluntary guidelines tuesday evening commuter 
train service was suspended by a rush hour wildcat strike 
the spring plan was implemented with an eye to national elections 
on may 14 the ruling radical civic union knew it was unlikely to 
retain control with monthly inflation in the double digits 
the plan initially seemed successful in throttling inflation the 
rate was was 276 percent in august and in single digits beginning 
in october 
but inflation which amounted to 387 percent in 1988 and has 
been tripledigit in 12 of the past 13 years is revivng after 
bottoming out at 57 percent in november it has risen every month 
three weeks ago the economy ministry touched off a 50 percent 
increase in the dollar by announcing it no longer would intervene in 
exchange markets to prop up the austral argentinas national 
currency 
the goal of the policy which exporters said drained revenue 
that legitimitely belonged to them was to hold down import prices 
and thus curb inflation 
that policy cost the central bank 17 billion including 486 
million during the first week of february 
last week the economy ministry made a concession to exporters by 
allowing them to sell a greater percentage of their foreign exchange 
revenue to the central bank at a higher rate though still far less 
than 100 percent at the free rate 
but exporters particularly farmers whose crops and livestock 
account for the biggest share of argentinas exports were 
unsatisfied 
on tuesday the central bank bought dollars from exporters at the 
official rate of 1468 australs per dollar the special rate of 
1835 australs and the free rate of 2810 australs 
members of the public paid 2820 australs per dollar at foreign 
exchange houses 
on feb 3 before the economy ministry measures were announced 
the public rate was 1759 australs stores and supermarkets have 
marked up prices ever since despite government prohibitions

morton thiokol inc stock rose sharply 
tuesday in the wake of the companys announcement that it is 
splitting its aerospace and commercial operations 
the chicagobased company announced monday it planned to return 
the name thiokol corp to its aerospace group and create a new 
specialty chemical airbag and salt company to be called morton 
international inc 
the move is expected to be final july 1 provided the internal 
revenue service rules it will be taxfree and the stockholders 
approve company officials said 
morton thiokol stock rose 225 to close at 4225 in new york 
stock exchange trading tuesday 
industry analysts applauded the companys decision 
im a little surprised but this is a positive move for the 
company and a benefit for shareholders said robert bartels of 
william blair amp co 
bartels said the aerospace business had depressed the price of 
the companys stock 
morton thiokols aerospace group was forced to undertake a 500 
million redesign of the space shuttle booster motor following the 
1986 challenger explosion which was blamed on a faulty booster 
joint 
but bartels said the drag on the stock would exist even without 
the challenger disaster because of the nature of defense work today 
lower spending demanded by congress 
morton thiokol stockholders will receive a shareforshare 
distribution of morton international stock company officials said 
the stock of both companies likely will qualify for listing on the 
new york stock exchange 
the utahbased aerospace group which manufactures the shuttle 
booster motor and other defense propulsion systems was acquired in 
1982 by morton norwich and the merged company was called morton 
thiokol inc 
the action is expected to have little change on the utah 
operation headquartered in ogden said aerospace group president ed 
garrison who will stay on as president and chief operating officer 
of thiokol corp 
indeed he said thiokol plans to bid on a 2 millionplus 
shuttle booster contract that would stretch through the mid1990s 
the company which employs about 7500 workers at its 
manufacturing and testing facility near brigham city is the states 
largest private employer another 500 to 600 workers affiliated with 
the utah operation are based at cape canaveral fla 
the aerospace operation has a total of more than 12000 employees 
morton international plans to maintain a presence in utah 
keeping its salt manufacturing facility at the great salt lake and 
maintaining the ogden plant where 350 people manufacture inflatable 
airbags for automobiles 
but garrison said the aerospace company retains 40 percent of the

sales of existing homes fell 74 percent in 
january the biggest decline in two years as activity returned to 
more normal levels following a december sales spurt a real estate 
trade group reported tuesday 
the national association of realtors said that existing 
singlefamily homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 363 million units in january following a 57 percent rise in 
december to a rate of 392 million 
it was the biggest onemonth drop since a 133 percent drop in 
january 1987 and left the pace of sales at its slowest point since 
july 
analysts however said they were not overly concerned noting 
that the december sales pace had been the fastest sales rate in two 
years even with the january setback sales were still 134 percent 
above where they were in january 1988 
overall januarys activity shows signs of another strong year 
for home sales said ira gribin president of the realtors the 
market is now dominated by the volume of buyers many of whom are 
repeat purchasers in their peak income years 
homes prices continued to rise in january even with the decline 
in sales the median price of a home rose 32 percent to 91500 
john tuccillo chief economist for the realtors said the price 
increase would have been even larger if it had not been for an 
increase in sales volume at the lowend of the price range as buyers 
altered their choices due to rising mortgage rates 
mortgage rates as tracked by a national survey done by the 
federal home loan mortgage corp hit 1078 percent last week with 
many economists expecting them to soon pass 11 percent 
the monthtomonth sales decline was led by a sharp 126 percent 
drop in the south which fell to an annual rate of 131 million 
units 
sales in the west declined by 86 percent to an annual rate of 
640000 units while sales in the midwest fell 59 percent to an 
annual rate of 950000 units 
the northeast was the only region of the country posting a sales 
increase from december to january a 14 percent rise to annual rate 
of 710000 units

lawyers for gaf corp asked a federal judge 
tuesday to dismiss the securities fraud case against the company 
saying federal prosecutors had not proven stock manipulation charges 
the governments case ended with the fact that one of its two 
principal witnesses testified that he didnt think he was 
manipulating stock in union carbide and he still doesnt think so 
defense lawyer max gitter said 
james t melton chief trader at the west coast brokerage firm 
jefferies amp co testified that while he sought to assure that union 
carbide stock closed at a specific price he had not attempted to 
deceive investors 
defense lawyers said stock manipulation charges were unfounded 
because the government had offered no proof gaf had intended to 
induce investors to buy the stock 
melton and broker boyd l jefferies were the governments key 
witnesses in the gaf case the first to be heard by a jury developed 
on information supplied by jailed speculator ivan boesky 
melton testifying under an immunity agreement reached with 
prosecutors backed up jefferies earlier testimony that he sought 
to inflate the stock price of union carbide corp to 22 a share in 
october 1986 
gaf and its vice chairman james t sherwin are charged with 
illegally trying through the stock purchases to raise the carbide 
stock price gaf held 10 million union carbide shares after an 
unsuccessful takeover attempt in november gaf sold 5 million 
shares for 23 each 
gitter said that while gaf naturally wanted to sell its union 
carbide holdings at the highest possible price neither gaf nor 
jefferies amp co did anything illegal in trying to boost the price of 
the shares 
the governments theory of market manipulation is not only 
novel its unsound gitter said there was no distortion of the 
market 
the defense also sought to have us district judge mary johnson 
lowe strike portions of jefferies testimony about melton on the 
grounds that it was hearsay and said the deletions would be so 
great as to require a mistrial 
prosecutors contentested the challenges and said the trial should 
continue lowe said she would consider the defense motion to dismiss 
the case and rule later 
assistant us attorney carl h loewenson jr argued that gaf and 
sherwin directed jefferies to make large purchases of union carbide 
near the close of trading on the new york and pacific stock 
exchanges on oct 29 and oct 30 1986 to push the closing price to 
22 or higher 
he said they entered the market not to make investments but to 
manipulate the price and induce investors to purchase union carbide 
what mr sherwin was interested in was boosting the price at a 
time his company held 10 million shares loewenson said 
the judge however indicated she was not convinced by the 
governments argument and said it would be difficult to determine 
gafs and sherwins motives 
how does one differentiate between the raising of stock prices 
in a legitimate trade in the market from an illegal trade lowe 
asked you cannot xray the mind of a person to determine what he 
is thinking at a particular time 
gaf was named in a 10count indictment handed up last july 
charging the wayne nj chemicals manufacturer with stock 
manipulation securities fraud wire fraud and conspiracy 
an earlier hearing ended in a mistrial in january when lowe found 
that a prosecutor had improperly but unintentionally withheld 
evidence
