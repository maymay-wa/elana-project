in a 24hour diplomatic blitz soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze pressed for peaceful settlement of 
conflicts in africa asia and the middle east 
in between he negotiated details of a strategic arms treaty 
won longsought us trade concessions and sealed a date for the 
next superpower summit 
the softspoken silverhaired soviet georgian has achieved star 
status on the world stage as a troubleshooter par excellence 
he has helped reverse the image of the soviet union as a 
hostile suspicious and nakedly aggressive world power and now 
seeks a role as peacemaker and mediator of disputes in the worlds 
diplomatic hot spots 
keeping a schedule as frenetic as those of his counterpart 
secretary of state james a baker iii and of president bush 
himself shevardnadze announced tuesday night after two days of 
talks with baker in houston that the kremlin would stop arming the 
afghan government that its troops propped up for years 
on wednesday morning before meeting with bush to seal a 
february summit date and work out a program of limited us aid for 
his countrys battered economy shevardnadze sat down for peace 
talks with the anticommunist rebel leader whose forces have been 
at war with the sovietbacked government in angola for 15 years 
and after his white house talks with bush he headed for a 
meeting with israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir who was in 
washington to see the president but agreed to a hastily arranged 
talk with shevardnadze as well 
the soviets clearly are attempting to engage in the industrial 
world as partners rather than enemies said john d steinbruner 
director of foreign policy studies at the brookings institution in 
washington weve been skeptical and reluctant and sort of 
mumbled about it 
now they have something that we need which is approval for 
what were doing in the persian gulf and theyre providing it and 
that gives them an occasion to further their agenda which is to 
overcome their own isolation and try to get out of the problem of 
being the opposing alliance all by themselves steinbruner said 
shevardnadze whose reputation as a mediator and dealmaker is 
not unlike that of baker has developed a relationship with his 
american counterpart that ranges from serious bargaining in search 
of middle ground to joking through interpreters about the 
complexities of their task 
they are fellow southerners who enjoy the outdoors and the most 
difficult challenges posed by their leaders baker has come to call 
shevardnadze his friend 
in a revealing discussion earlier this year on his approach to 
foreign policy shevardnadze lamented that his country poured money 
and resources into southern africa and elsewhere for decades but 
has little to show for it now instead of schools and hospitals he 
said the beneficiaries have guns and bloodshed backwardness and 
poverty 
it was not he said a recod of which one can feel proud but 
it is one that will take years to undo

americas newest national newspaper is edited 
by an exconvict for those who are still behind bars its avowed 
aim to help them stay out when they get out 
the first issue of inside journal a project of watergate figure 
charles colsons prison fellowship organization is in the mail for 
distribution to inmates from california to connecticut 
the eightpage paper beginning as a quarterly with the aim of 
monthly publication by 1992 got generally good marks during a 
sneak preview this week in the chapel of the district of columbias 
suburban lorton reformatory 
one inmate garfield wells who said he had been in another 
prison before lorton asked whether the paper would take on touchy 
issues such as prisoner complaints about the quality of medical 
care and food 
we are going to address difficult issues like that said 
senior editor craig pruitt we are going to do it carefully in 
such a way that we can continue to address those difficult issues 
its not going to be a fluff piece 
some of the dozen or so inmates who took part out of 12000 in 
the prison said they thought more of the writing ought to be done 
by prisoners 
this is a natural think tank a laboratory of men who have had 
nothing but time to think said inmate james leak we prisoners 
are the best observers of the inside of the laboratory 
pruitt told the lorton residents that inmates in a number of 
states gave advice on the papers design and future issues will 
contain inmate contributions 
the second issue will feature a poem by a prisoner in 
pennsylvania he said 
pruitt said he spent more than 15 years in business before being 
convicted of income tax fraud and serving two years in seagoville 
federal prison in texas two years out of my life that i will 
never forget 
the editor has written freelance articles for religious 
publications and worked as a religious broadcaster but is not a 
journalist by background he has a staff of two assisting him and 
says this probably will double in the next six months 
the prison fellowship is an evangelical organization aimed at 
bringing christianity to prison inmates like all of its projects 
the paper is supported by charitable contributions it accepts no 
advertising 
i dont think we would interest many advertisers since 
prisoners dont have any money to buy their products said james 
w jewell the groups senior vice president for communications 
pruitt said articles on christian themes will make up 25 percent 
of the papers content 
we dont want to be overwhelming the reader with that he 
said we are walking the line of our christian beliefs but we 
are also putting out a paper that is not a religious tract 
our primary goal is to provide inmates with resources for life 
in prison and so that once released they will never set foot in 
prison again colson said in a news release on the launching of 
the newspaper 
the former white house aide served seven months in the maxwell 
air force base prison in montgomery ala after pleading guilty to 
obstruction of justice in connection with a case involving pentagon 
papers figure daniel ellsberg 
the newspapers first issue features a frontpage article about 
the conversion of a montana inmate who attends a chapel service 
where colson speaks a piece on pop star stevie wonders visit to a 
maryland prison and a reprint of a story quoting gov james 
blanchard saying michigan will build no more prisons after 1991 
it also offers advice on how to write a letter to a loved one 
and information from the social security administration on benefits 
available to released prisoners 
jewell who has a degree in journalism said all articles for 
the newspaper are reviewed by two advisory boards one of inmates 
and one of correctional officials 
we are editorially independent of any department of 
corrections he said but if the correctional advisory board 
unanimously advised against running an article he said the 
editors might consider pulling it 
we are just fully aware of who our gatekeepers are he said 
the paper wont be very effective if it cant get in 
jewell said the organization distributed 88000 of the papers to 
prisons in alabama california colorado connecticut indiana and 
pennsylvania as well as at lorton 
it eventually aims to reach 300000 prisoners about half of the 
prison population by 1992 
i know from being in prison myself that people will read 
anything they can get their hands on colson said in a telephone 
interview from his reston va office so we figure this will 
have a long shelf life in the prisons it will get passed around

the letters range from lengthy singlespaced 
dissertations to handwritten pleas on flowered stationery but many 
say the same thing please keep our country out of a persian gulf 
war 
im not a liberal im an old rightwing conservative but i 
just dont see the need for a war over therejames abbott said in 
explaining why he sent a 10page opus to every member of the 
colorado congressional delegation plus the democratic leadership of 
the house and senate 
only a special session can have a chance to call off this 
impending holocaust wrote abbott 53 if congress fails to 
act the body bags are coming home tens of thousands of them 
abbott a wheatridge colo geologist in the goldmining 
business told the lawmakers he served in the navy and does not 
oppose war when used as a last resort to protect us interests 
but he added that it is disgusting to watch a phony war 
being created right before our eyes and even more disgusting 
to see congress inaction please try to stop this tragic 
occurrence he wrote 
abbotts letter was among dozens received in the past few weeks 
by the offices of rep patricia schroeder dcolo a senior member 
of the house armed services committee 
a wellknown liberal mrs schroeder is one of 45 house members 
who have filed a suit to try to force president bush to get 
permission from congress before going to war 
other members of the armed services committee with more 
conservative views declined to let a reporter see their gulf mail 
or ask the senders if their letters could be read or their names 
used 
the white house refused to comment either on the volume of 
gulfrelated mail or whether it has tended to be supportive or 
critical 
for the most part mrs schroeders mail reflects the concerns 
of people who disagree with bush and think congress is not doing 
enough to avert bloodshed 
please help keep us out of a war begged a fort collins 
colo retiree who did not want her name disclosed with patience 
and time surely sanctions would succeed why should people be 
killed because someone ran out of patience 
the american people do not want another vietnam nor do they 
want us to police the world this is an arab matter and should be 
left to the arabs involved to reach a decision wrote william m 
mcmechen 35 a chemical engineer from denver 
world war ii veteran trigg a shelton of englewood colo 
wondered why the united states would intervene to protect kuwait 
from iraqi aggression when it did not do the same for iran a decade 
ago 
and if oil rather than a principle is at stake wrote the 
retired mail carrier can we justify all those lost lives for 
about 4 percent of the oil we use here in the united states can we 
manage without that oil better than we can manage without those 
precious lives 
these are hard questions mrs schroeder but they need to be 
asked shelton concluded and they need answers before we get 
into a shooting war 
one correspondent had no such reservations 
the real villain in the gulf is us wrote commodities trader 
gene w edwards 47 of denver we supported iraqs saddam 
hussein during his war with iran now we must deal with the 
monster we created and the only terms must be unconditional 
surrender either we must bomb iraq flat or occupy it 
another man an air force veteran and retired nuclear medicine 
technician sent mrs schroeder a copy of a letter in which he 
asked bush to get better treatment for his son and others serving 
in saudi arabia 
the writer charles r woltz of lakewood colo complained 
about saudi restrictions on the clothing religious observances and 
entertainment of us troops he said his son troy 19 is being 
treated as a dishonored interloper in a country he is trying to 
protect 
if my only son must end the woltz line and give his life for 
our country i believe he and the rest of the troops should be 
accorded a little of the warm fuzzies they deserve woltz wrote

president bush will go to moscow for his 
fourth summit with mikhail s gorbachev in february and is helping 
the soviet leader feed his people with up to 1 billion in credit 
to purchase food 
the deliveries could be on their way within two months even as 
bitter winter deepens the hardships the soviets are experiencing as 
gorbachev tries to lead them from communism to a market economy 
i want perestroika restructuring to succeed bush said 
wednesday as he announced what the white house described as the 
largest initial assistance package the united states has ever 
offered any country 
standing at the presidents side soviet foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze acknowledged his nation is going through rough 
times but he said the soviet people will cope with the 
problems 
the package includes technical help in reforming a stagnant 
transportation system medicines and support in access to 
international lending institutions 
the summit meanwhile was scheduled for feb 1113 in moscow 
even though the nuclear arms reduction treaty that is its projected 
centerpiece is not finished 
bush had vowed not to hold the summit unless the accord was 
ready but a white house official said that did not preclude 
setting a date to meet with gorbachev 
secretary of state james a baker iii who has worked on the 
treaty with shevardnadze in houston and in washington this week 
said a number of technical issues remain unresolved 
these include monitoring of solid rocket and missile assembly 
facilities to guard against breaches in the accord which will cut 
stockpiles of longrange nuclear bombers submarines and missiles 
by about 30 percent 
but bush said im pleased with the great progress weve made 
on start strategic arms reduction talks and hopeful that well be 
ready to sign a treaty in moscow 
in the meantime the president suspended at least until next 
june 16yearold trade restrictions that congress had imposed on 
the soviet union to try to force emigration of jews and other 
minorities 
baker said the us assistance program would include credits for 
500 million to 1 billion in food shipments that is more than 
shevardnadze requested tuesday in their talks in houston said a 
us official who briefed reporters under rules shielding his 
identity 
the soviet union is facing tough times difficult times but i 
believe that this is good reason to act now in order to help the 
soviet union stay the course of democratization and to undertake 
market reforms bush said 
the target for about 40 years of us invective and a massive 
military buildup the soviets lately have been on friendly terms 
with the united states including supporting bushs drive to force 
iraq to reverse its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
but baker told reporters you shouldnt consider any of the 
steps taken toay to be a payoff or payback for cooperation on the 
persian gulf 
one step bush did not take was to recommend the lifting of high 
tariffs against soviet imports but he and baker hinted that may 
come after the soviet parliament makes good on a longstanding 
promise to liberalize its emigration laws already jews and other 
minorities are being permitted to leave the country in record 
numbers 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said bushs decision to 
provide aid was in the american tradition of responding to human 
needs and also could give american farmers a major boost 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo who was 
criticized by the white house nine months ago for recommending the 
kind of steps bush now has taken commented america cannot stand 
on the sidelines as the cold war era ends and the soviet union 
struggles to find its future 
but sen jesse helms rnc said the very moment that 
gorbachev is considered to be the most disliked man in the soviet 
union is scarcely a sensible time to give his government 
credibility and financial support by the american taxpayers 
and sen bill bradley dnj said its a mistake to waive 
the jacksonvanik restrictions in order to allow more subsidies and 
loan guarantees he said such a move puts new burdens on 
american taxpayers and does little if anything to relieve hunger 
in the soviet union

here is a brief look at the operation of the 
jacksonvanik amendment president bush waived some provisions of 
the amendment on wednesday to permit food sales on credit to the 
soviet union 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
jacksonvanik the amendment to the 1974 us trade act 
sponsored by the late sen henry jackson dwash and former rep 
charles vanik dohio prohibits preferential tariffs or access to 
us credits to any nation that denies its citizens the right to 
emigrate 
waiver the law allows a waiver of the amendment if the 
president believes the emigration restrictions have been eased any 
waiver must be renewed every june when congress could restore the 
waiver 
emigration soviet president mikhail gorbachev has lifted 
virtually all restrictions on the emigration of jews from the 
soviet union some 150000 have left for israel over the past year 
but the supreme soviet has not yet passed legislation that would 
anchor gorbachevs emigration reforms in soviet law bush said he 
hoped such legislation would pass soon 
credits bushs waiver gives two government agencies the 
exportimport bank and the commodity credit corp authority to 
guarantee bank loans to back american exports to the soviet union 
in effect to cosign the soviets ious 
the commodity credit corp an agency of the agriculture 
department provides loan guarantees for sales of agricultural 
products while the exportimport bank an independent agency 
provides guarantees for sales of us manufactured goods 
the soviets had agreed to buy about about 12 million tons of 
wheat and about 600000 tons of corn in the final three months of 
this year for cash however us farm groups feared that the 
soviets caught in a cash squeeze because of their failing economy 
would not be able to buy those grains without credit 
most favored nation a waiver of the jacksonvanik amendment 
also is necessary for granting the soviets mostfavorednation 
trade status that would allow soviet exports to the united states 
to qualify for the lowet tariffs granted to any other nation for 
the commodity in question 
soviet products carry tariffs that are as much as 10 times 
higher than the duties levied on similar products from other 
countries 
the soviets will not get the mostfavored tariffs until both 
houses of congress approve a new trade agreement the agreement was 
signed by bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev last june but 
the administration has not yet submitted it to congress for 
approval

mobil oil corp has temporarily suspended its 
search for oil in perus jungle after an attack by leftist rebels 
destroyed a jungle surveying camp it had operated 
the attack this week was the most serious against perus oil 
industry in 10 years of political violence as well as the largest 
ever against a foreign company in peru 
the lima offices of multinational corporations are often the 
target of rebel bombs but damage is usually slight 
perus energy minister fernando sanchez albavera said 
wednesday that new yorkbased mobil would resume its survey 
operations in six to eight months with perus army providing 
protection for the surveyers 
it is very important the contract be respected sanchez told 
a news conference it is an example for investors throughout the 
world 
but a mobil spokesman refused to say when exploration would be 
resumed 
procuban rebels on monday took over mobils survey camp in the 
upper huallaga valley 270 miles northeast of lima 
the rebels from the tupac amaru revolutionary group blew up 
vehicles equipment and buildings and stole a helicopter no one 
was hurt in the camp operated by a mobil subcontractor the 
halliburton geophysical service 
sanchez said the rebels caused 2 to 3 million in damages 
a newspaper with close ties to the tupac amaru group last week 
harshly criticized the mobil operation the paper called the 
exploration contract a swindle and said it allows mobil to 
carry away all the profits 
the upper huallaga is the worlds main source the raw material 
of cocaine hundreds of rebels from both the tupac amaru group and 
the more radical shining path movement operate in the area 
in september 198 mobil signed a contract with the state oil 
company petroperu to explore four lots in the huallaga 
mobil has already spent 15 million to explore the area and the 
contract obliges mobil to spend at least 1075 million 
the roughly 650 halliburton employees at the survey camp were 
left at least temporarily without jobs sanchez said reports from 
the zone said most workers have fled the camp 
the mobil spokesman said that before the attack the company had 
stationed guards at the camp only to deter petty theft he said 
the camp would not reopen until the armed forces agree to protect 
the workers 
peru produces some 132000 barrels of oil per day an oil 
exporter in the mid 1980s peru had to import oil by the end of the 
decade 
between 1981 and 1989 perus proven reserves fell by more than 
half from 8352 to 4059 million barrels but foreign companies 
have shown renewed interest in peru after the government changed 
exploration regulations in 1987

americans who skip todays last ussponsored 
flight from iraq will still be able get american help in leaving 
the middle east nation or neighboring kuwait the state department 
says 
the last planned ussponsored charter was leaving iraq today 
with at least 15 people on board th plane was heading to 
frankfurt germany for a stopover before the americans return to 
the united states 
us officials estimate that about 500 americans most of them 
children with dual citizenship have opted to remain in kuwait or 
iraq 
anyone who decides to leave at a later time can fly out by 
commercial iraqi airliner state department spokesman richard 
boucher said wednesday 
iraqi airways has started twicedaily flights between kuwait 
city and baghdad he said once in iraq officials at the us 
embassy will expedite departures through jordan 
there are ways of getting out of kuwait in the future 
boucher said 
the embassy in occupied kuwait will be closed once we are 
confident that all americans who want to leave kuwait have done 
so boucher added ambassador nathaniel howell and his staff had 
been under siege at the embassy since iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 
about 188 americans have been evacuated from iraq and kuwait 
over the last week they include 70 people who were in hiding 86 
men kept as socalled human shields at strategic sites in iraq 
and 32 private citizens holed up at the embassies in kuwait and 
iraq 
meantime the administration accused iraq of blocking agreement 
on dates for diplomatic talks between the two countries 
iraq has asked that secretary of state james a baker iii visit 
baghdad on jan 12 but the united states said that is too close to 
jan 15 the deadline set by the united nations security council to 
authorize military force if the iraqis have not left kuwait 
president bush proposed a diplomatic exchange including a 
white house meeting with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz as a 
lastditch effort to find a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis 
and iraq accepted the idea 
however boucher said we have offered 15 dates and iraq has 
offered none iraq continues to block agreement on dates 
iraq has suggested that its foreign minister come to washington 
to see bush on dec 17 boucher said the united states would not 
accept that date unless a date had been fixed for bakers trip to 
iraq

i want perestroika restructuring to succeed president 
bush as he announced a 1 billion loan plan to help the soviet 
union deal with food shortages 
 
you shouldnt consider any of the steps taken today to be a 
payoff or payback for cooperation on the persian gulf 
secretary of state james a baker iii as details of ussoviet 
cooperation including a meeting of presidents bush and mikhail s 
gorbachev in moscow in february were announced 
 
the very moment that gorbachev is considered to be the most 
disliked man in the soviet union is scarcely a sensible time to 
give his government credibility and financial support by the 
american taxpayers sen jesse helms rnc

the head of the federal railroad 
administration says the fact no one was killed in the collision of 
an amtrak passenger train and a commuter train in boston proves 
that modern railroad equipment is crashworthy and saves lives 
fra administrator gilbert e carmichael said that is true even 
though 264 people were injured when the passenger train from 
washington derailed and rammed the commuter train in bostons back 
bay station wednesday 
this is a beautiful demonstration of how an accident in the 
railroad industry can shake up a lot of people and injure people 
but also save lives there were no fatalities carmichael said in 
an interview 
this accident was dramatic it was a messy accident 
carmichael said but the trains performed beautifully in 
protecting people the equipment performed as it was designed and 
it is designed to take it 
carmichael noted that only a handful of those injured required 
hospitalization both locomotives derailed and were damaged beyond 
repair he said 
meanwhile investigators for the national transportation safety 
board said they were probing possible similarities between 
wednesdays accident and a 1987 crash in which two commuter trains 
collided in the same boston station 
carmichael said inspectors from his agency also were looking 
into the cause of the derailment and collision 
at this point its a mystery carmichael said adding that 
it may take several days to learn what went wrong 
the fra also subjected the train crews to alcohol and drug 
tests mandatory after all serious rail accidents the results will 
not be available for several days 
in wednesdays accident amtraks night owl passenger train from 
washington smashed into the crowded commuter train during the 
morning rush hour 
amtrak said the night owl apparently derailed on a curve and 
went into the side of the train on an adjacent track 
in the 1987 boston accident an amtrakoperated massachusetts 
bay transportation authority commuter train was standing at the 
platform of the back bay station unloading passengers during 
morning rush hour it was struck from the rear by another 
amtrakoperated commuter train 
that accident injured 110 people 
after an investigation the ntsb concluded that the probable 
cause of the accident was the display of an improper wayside signal 
resulting from an improperly designed signal system 
it also blamed the failure of an engineer to act on a danger 
signal and the failure of amtrak supervisors to follow up on 
reported signal failures 
we will be looking at the 1987 accident and this one to see if 
there are any similarities said safety board spokesman brent n 
bahler 
the board investigates all major transportation accidents in the 
united states pinpoints a probable cause for each and makes 
corrective but nonbinding recommendations 
ntsb officials pointed out that a 1987 board recommendation 
calling for a federal rule requiring installation of a control 
system on mainline tracks to provide for the positive separation of 
all trains has never been implemented 
the recommendation emerged from investigations of several 
serious rail accidents in the last few years including the jan 4 
1987 crash of an amtrak passenger train and conrail freight 
locomotives at chase md near baltimore 
that accident the worst in amtraks history killed 16 people 
and injured 175

downing two warplanes with 
surfacetoair missiles during a 3weekold offensive guerrillas 
have eroded military morale and prompted washington to rush tens of 
millions in aid to the government 
the leftist rebels successful use of sams has also provided 
fodder for government officials determined to gain restoration of 
other military aid that was recently slashed by the us congress 
us sources working with the salvadoran air force speaking 
anonymously said the salvadoran high command wants washington to 
provide moresophisticated cobra attack helicopters to replace 
downed or damaged vietnamera hueys the hueys have been the 
rightwing governments most significant tactical advantage in the 
11yearold civil war 
on nov 23 guerrillas shot down an a37 attack jet in the 
eastern province of usulutan it was the first time in the war the 
rebels had brought down a warplane with a missile 
they did it again dec 4 downing an ac47 in the northern 
province of chalatenango 
rebel ground fire brought down a uh1m helicopter in usulutan on 
nov 26 and a uh1h helicopter near the honduran border on 
wednesday the armed forces said one helicopter gunner was killed 
in the second incident 
rebel commander jorge melendez on the clandestine insurgent 
radio said us protests over the use of missiles are cynical 
and shameless 
he noted it was the united states in supplying nicaraguan 
contra rebels with redeyes during the 1980s that introduced 
sophisticated surfacetoair missiles to the region 
rebel spokesman miguel saenz acknowledged that the farabundo 
marti national liberation front or fmln has acquired sovietmade 
sa7s sa14s and redeyes 
the salvadoran and us governments contend the missiles were 
supplied during the past 13 months by nicaraguan sandinistas 
rebel commanders admit privately that some missiles have been 
provided by their sandinista allies but they also say they have 
bought black market redeyes from demobilized contras 
conversations with air force pilots infantry officers who 
depend on air support and us technicians who work with the air 
force indicate pilot morale is at its lowest point of the war 
theyre scared theyre walking around ilopango with their 
eyebrows up in the middle of their foreheads said one us 
technician imitating a wideeyed fearful face 
an a37 pilot admitted privately were worried he 
described missile evasion tactics being practiced daily over the 
a37s base at the international airport on the pacific coast a 
region normally free of rebel activity 
an infantry lieutenant said his troops went hungry at times and 
were low on ammunition because helicopter pilots feared landing in 
zones where rebel antiaircraft fire was likely 
on tuesday an entire 11man patrol of the elite bracamonte 
infantry battalion surrendered to rebels in chalatenango after 
finding itself surrounded and bereft of air support according to 
rebel and army sources 
on wednesday about 200 soldiers some seriously wounded 
retreated into neighboring honduras after battling with rebels the 
honduran government said 
the us congress in october cut in half the 85 million in 
military aid previously allotted for fiscal 1991 
the reduction was intended to push the armed forces toward a 
negotiated peace settlement the cut was also to express 
displeasure with military stonewalling of the investigation into 
the november 1989 murder by army troops of six jesuit 
priesteducators their housekeeper and her daughter 
on nov 20 the rebels began stepping up the pace of combat in 
what they said was a campaign to force the government into 
concessions at the negotiating table and punish the armed forces 
for human rights abuses 
on friday the state department announced that delivery of 481 
million in military aid was being speeded up in response to the 
serious new escalation in fmln guerrilla offensive actions 
the funds included 106 million left over from last year and 
375 million from the fiscal 1991 account 
the us legislation cutting military aid in half provides for 
restoration of the slashed 425 million if the rebels fail to 
negotiate peace in good faith launches an offensive that threatens 
to topple the government or receives large amounts of lethal 
military eqiupment from abroad 
the introduction of sophisticated armament that clearly comes 
from nicaragua or cuba should be one of the elements the us 
congress will have to examine and because of that we predict that 
god willing the frozen aid will be restored said ernesto 
altschul viceminister of the presidency in an interview

the release handle on an dc9 emergency exit 
wasnt working during a fire that swept the jet after a runway 
collision federal investigators say a newspaper said the failure 
cost two people their lives 
the two a flight attendant and a passenger whose bodies 
reportedly were found in the tail section near the exit were 
among eight people killed in the collision on dec 3 between the 
northwest jet and a northwest boeing 727 
national transportation safety board official john lauber said 
wednesday that investigators found that the handle that pops off 
the tail cone and deploys an emergency slide did not work and that 
the stem of the handle was broken 
the ntsb wouldnt speculate on how the handle became broken 
whether anyone actually tried to operate it or whether the 
equipment was to blame for any deaths 
with the investigation of the dec 3 accident still going on 
ntsb spokesman alan pollock said we cant get into that kind of 
analysis at this time 
however the detroit news citing an unidentified investigator 
reported wednesday that the flight attendant and passenger tried to 
escape through the hatch but died after the release jammed and 
trapped them 
the investigator told the news the bodies of 22year flight 
attendant heidi joost 43 of dearborn and kingsley brown 30 a 
passenger from pittsburgh were found a few feet from the release 
lever 
lauber said the handle was found partially raised from its 
stowed position and the stem of the handle was broken 
the 727 was racing toward takeoff when it struck the taxiing 
dc9 which had turned in front of it the 153 people aboard the 
727 escaped injury 
the ntsb did not interpret the findings and neither can 
northwest the airline said in a statement 
the airline checked the tailcone release mechanisms on all its 
dc9s sunday and monday to ensure ourselves of the dependability 
of those units and we assured ourselves of that said spokesman

gulf so he joined the coast guard 
hes among about 4000 people passing through cape may this year 
for eight weeks in the nations only coast guard recruit training 
center 
thats up from 3500 in 1989 but center commander scott burhoe 
said its unclear if more people have chosen the guard over other 
services because of the possibility of war in the persian gulf

conflict he said 
during the vietnam war the coast guard took in some pretty 
bright people burhoe said 
smeltzer 20 of myrtle beach sc said he had been looking 
for a better job 
i was breaking my back as a ups loader i could have made good 
money there but i wasnt enjoying it he said the persian 
gulf situation distracted me from the other armed services 
recruits are told before they ever get to the center however 
that they might be called on in war burhoe said 
up to 600 activeduty and reserve guardsmen now are serving on 
naval vessels in the persian gulf area a spokesman for the service 
said most are specialists in boarding vessels and looking for 
contraband 
during peacetime the coast guard takes orders from the 
transportation department when congress declares war the guard 
comes under navy jurisdiction 
the 200yearold guards peacetime mission is to protect the 
nations waters and the people and boats plying them 
recruits average 19 or 20 years old but some are as young as 17 
and others are in their mid20s burhoe said about 10 percent are 
women 
during boot camp theyll get short haircuts undergo a battery 
of health exams and physical fitness tests and learn everything 
from tying a square knot and marching in formation to 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation and firing weapons

for the second time in a year usair cargo 
workers have rejected the teamsters efforts to represent them 
in a ballot count announced wednesday by the federal mediation 
board only 2475 of the 7200 airline workers eligible to vote 
backed the teamsters the union needed 3600 votes 
the election was an allornothing event for the teamsters who 
already represented some 2000 usair workers in pittsburgh 
philadelphia buffalo and boston wednesdays loss means those 
workers will no longer be teamster members 
the bulk of usair workers simply didnt bother to vote thereby 
siding with the arlington vabased carrier the mediation board 
said 
in january the teamsters failed at their first effort to 
organize usair workers at 180 airports when as in wednesdays 
election most workers didnt vote 
however the mediation board later ruled that the teamsters 
deserved another try saying the airlines antiunion campaign 
illegally tainted the first election 
even before wednesdays ballot count the teamsters had filed 
charges with the board alleging that usair had illegally interfered 
with their second organizing drive too the board has given the 
teamsters until jan 3 to file additional evidence and usair until 
jan 23 to file its response 
usair spokeswoman susan young said the carrier was confident it 
would be found innocent of any wrongdoing in the second election 
she said that in urging workers not to vote for teamsters 
representation in the latest election the airline tried to show 
that workers dont need a union 
we have good employeemanagement relations we simply felt 
that employees had nothing to gain from teamsters representation 
young said 
the teamsters had no immediate comment according to an official 
who answered the phone at the unions airline division in new york 
after the first election the teamsters had charged that usair 
unfairly interfered with their organizing drive by calling meetings 
with small groups of workers to discuss the unions campaign 
putting up antiteamsters posters urging workers to burn their 
ballots and producing antiteamsters videotapes 
the board agreed with the teamsters clearing the way for 
wednesdays election usair denied any wrongdoing 
the teamsters had represented cargo workers at usair before its 
1989 merger with piedmont airlines whose employees were not 
members of the union 
a year ago the mediation board ordered the first election to 
determine whether workers at usair and former piedmont employees 
would be represented by the teamsters three other unions 
representing pilots flight attendants and mechanics at usair 
gained the right to represent the piedmont workers without 
elections

the export value of us farm products to the 
12nation european community will hold about steady in the fiscal 
year that began oct 1 according to agriculture department 
analysts 
a breakdown of 199091 agricultural export estimate showed 
shipments to the ec at 68 billion compared with 6827 billion 
in the last fiscal year 
in 1991 lower cotton and meat exports are expected to offset 
gains in horticultural and other highvalue products sold to the 
ec said the report released wednesday 
sales to all of western europe including some nonec countries 
was indicated at 73 billion compared with 7319 billion in 
198990 
asia continues to be the dominant regional market for us farm 
products although the total value is expected to drop to 154 
billion from more than 16 billion in each of the two previous 
years 
exports to japan the largest singlecountry foreign market was 
forecast at 81 billion about the same as last year the record 
was 813 billion in fiscal 1989 
although in its longest postwar expansionary period japans 
economic outlook is clouded by higher crude oil prices higher 
interest rates and declining asset values the report said 
higher interest rates could dampen japans capital spending 
which has propelled the current economic boom although japanese 
consumption has remained strong the report said the stock markets 
slide has reduced optimism about japans economy weathering oil 
price increases 
canada is expected to buy 4 billion worth of us agricultural 
products in fiscal 1991 up from 371 billion last year 
but the report said a change in bookkeeping indicates canadian 
imports probably were understated last year meaning there will be 
no expected change in 1991 
the forecast showed the value of commodities headed for the 
soviet union this fiscal year at 2 billion down from more than 
298 billion in 198990 
however that estimate was made before a new 1 billion credit 
arrangement was announced wednesday to help moscow buy more grain 
and other commodities 
looking at china the report said there will be relatively low 
demand for us agricultural products due to the countrys sluggish 
economy a rising budget deficit and two consecutive years of 
extremely successful grain harvests 
overall china is expected to import only about 600 million 
worth of us agricultural products in 199091 down from 909 
million last year which was also down sharply 
reductions in the value of us wheat and most other minor 
agricultural product exports are forecast to more than offset 
increased earnings from cotton cattle hides and poultry 
products the report said 
as a result of the embargo imposed for its invasion of kuwait 
iraq is not expected to have any us agricultural shipments in 
199091 the report said last fiscal year before the aug 2 
invasion exports were about 496 million 
total us agricultural exports in the current fiscal year are 
forecast at 385 billion down from 401 billion in 198990 that 
overall forecast was announced by usda on nov 27 
 
washington ap if the soviet union or anyone else wants to 
buy edible dry beans us producers have had a bumper crop this 
year 
the agriculture departments latest estimate of 1990 production 
is 326 million hundredweight up 38 percent from last year and 70 
percent more than two years ago when drought cut yields in some 
major areas 
department officials said this years output of beans is just 
short of the record harvest in 1981 
a good finish in michigan colorado kansas nebraska new 
york and wyoming boosted the average yield to 1542 pounds per 
acre from 1437 last year they said in a report minnesota and 
north dakota coming out of a drought show productions well above 
the last two years 
navy bean output jumped 57 percent from last year because of 
record yields in michigan and increased acreage harvested in 
minnesota and north dakota the report said great northern bean 
production recovered in nebraska after and short crop last year 
pinto bean production was up 43 percent from 1989 and kidney 
beans gained 38 percent from last year 
bumper crops in michigan and new york more than doubled the 
crop of black turtle soup beans the report said the output of 
pink and small red beans remained strong although both were below 
a year ago the small white bean crop continues to get smaller 
according to the departments november price report the 
allbean price paid to growers averaged 1820 per 100 pounds down 
from 2770 a year earlier

some home buyers will have a harder time 
finding loans next spring because a major governmentsponsored 
mortgage buyer is tightening its standards 
the federal home loan mortgage corp known as freddie mac said 
wednesday that after march 31 it will stop buying two types of 
mortgages adjustablerate loans with less than a 10 percent down 
payment and lowdocumentation loans 
the rule changes come as a growing number of lenders are 
tightening credit terms on a variety of loans creating what some 
borrowers say is a credit crunch 
in addition after jan 2 freddie mac will more closely 
scrutinize its purchases of loans originated by mortgage brokers 
and other third parties working for lenders 
the change on lowdownpayment adjustablerate mortgages will 
pinch firsttime home buyers the most consumer advocates and 
economists say the restriction on lowdocumentation mortgages 
affects mostly buyers moving up to more expensive homes 
many renters especially in highcost areas on the east and west 
coasts can raise only a 5 percent down payment to purchase their 
first home 
housing prices have gone up so much that arms adjustablerate 
mortgages have been about the only tool available to make it 
possible for some people to buy a home said peggy miller of the 
consumer federation of america 
its bad not only for firsttime home buyers she said 
arms offer at least some flexibility in difficult situations for 
moderateincome people 
very clearly its going to mean that there are some folks that 
could have gotten into the market that wont be able to get into 
the market but i dont think its going to stop housing in its 
tracks said economist john a tuccillo of the national 
association of realtors 
more significant he said are the restrictions on thirdparty 
loans as many as one in four mortgages are originated by brokers 
rather than directly by lenders he said the restrictions mean 
fewer brokeroriginated loans will be accepted using streamlined 
procedures 
freddie mac has added additional layers of bureaucracy to the 
mortgage process said james nelson president of the mortgage 
bankers association of america 
as the ultimate source of about one in every four home 
mortgages freddie mac and a sister organization have an enormous 
impact on what types of mortgages lenders are willing to make 
the federal national mortgage association fannie mae will 
continue to finance lowdownpayment adjustable mortgages but two 
months ago it imposed restrictions on lowdocumentation loans 
both types of loans are considered riskier than standard 
mortgages for more than a year freddie mac and fannie mae have 
been pressured by the treasury department to tighten their 
procedures generally 
although both have only limited government backing most 
investors assume they would be bailed out by the government if they 
got into trouble 
freddie mac spokeswoman janice conway said the arm change 
affects a limited number of loans and was a prudent move with real 
estate prices in some areas and the national economy deteriorating 
were doing borrowers a service by helping them to keep their 
homes rather than just getting them nnto the home she said 
however michelle maier an attorney with consumers union said 
freddie mac could have adopted a less onerous approach by requiring 
lenders to exercise more care in making lowdownpayment arms 
rather than excluding them completely 
freddie mac estimates about 25 percent of the loans it is 
purchasing this year will be lowdocumentation mortgages it said 9 
percent of the adjustablerate loans in its portfolio are 
lowdownpayment mortgages 
fannie mae and freddie mac are congressionally chartered but 
stockholderowned companies they purchase loans from banks and 
other lenders retain some and repackage others into securities for 
resale to investors

a record store owner lashed out in 
court with a few fourletter words before being fined 1000 for 
selling 2 live crews as nasty as they wanna be after the album 
was ruled obscene 
before passing sentence wednesday broward county judge paul 
backman asked charles freeman if he had anything to say 
yes your honor id like to say the prosecutors you this 
whole court is out of order freeman said 
the judge said he wouldnt hold the outburst against freeman 
who apologized moments later 
freeman 32 could have been received up to a year in jail on 
the obscenity conviction for selling the recording to an undercover 
deputy he said he should never have been convicted at all 
three members of 2 live crew were acquitted of obscenity in 
october for performing the songs charges against a record store 
owner in texas were dropped earlier this week and an alabama mans 
conviction for selling the album was overturned in february 
2 live crew walked away free a man in texas walked away free 
a man in alabama walked away free freeman said its just 
frustrating 
if youre angry at this entire situation from beginning to 
end as you may well be i would suggest you channel that anger in 
a different direction the judge said suggesting freeman work to 
change the law 
the judge recommended that the fine be donated to a local 
performing arts school 
prosecutor pedro dijols said he was satisfied with the sentence 
defense attorney bruce rogow said he will appeal 
i think the judge recognized what a difficult thing it is to 
determine obscenity rogow said i think he also recognized the 
irony of this case the guys who make the music sing it publicly 
get acquitted but this guy who sells a little cassette tape 
in june a federal judge in fort lauderdale pronounced as 
nasty as they wanna be obscene 
debbie bennett a spokeswoman for 2 live crew leader luther 
campbell did not immediately return calls for comment 
freeman owner of ec records was convicted in october by an 
allwhite jury the defense had argued for a more diverse ethnic 
and economic mix obscenity cases are decided on what jurors 
determine community standards to be

sir ian trethowan the chairman of thames 
television and a former directorgeneral of the british 
broadcasting corp died at age 68 a few hours after thames said he 
was retiring because of ill health 
trethowan who died wednesday night at londons cromwell 
hospital had fought a long battle with motor neurone disease the 
company said 
a former political journalist and deputy editor of independent 
television news he was confined to a wheelchair because of his 
illness which progressively wastes the muscles 
thames one of the companies in britains commercial independent 
television network had announced earlier wednesday that trethowan 
would be succeeded as chairman next month by movie producer lord 
brabourne 
trethowan who began work as a newspaper reporter in york in 
northern england had been chairman of thames since 1987 
thames this year cut its staff from 2000 to 1500 the cut was 
largely due to government insistence that in order to increase 
competition broadcasters should take 25 percent of their programs 
from independent producers apart from areas such as news and 
current affairs 
thames like other commercial tv companies has also been hit by 
a sharp fall in advertising revenues caused by the current economic 
recession 
trethowan held the twin posts of deputy editor and political 
editor of independent television news from 1958 to 1963 and then 
joined the bbc as a commentator 
he became directorgeneral of the bbc in 1977 and held the post 
until 1982 during that time he resolutely defended the bbc 
against criticism by the government of thenprime minister margaret 
thatcher 
government criticism centered on some bbc news coverage of 
sectarian and political strife in northern ireland bbc reporting 
on british intelligence agencies and bbc reporting of the 1982 
falklands war some of which mrs thatchers government charged 
was biased in favor of argentina 
in 1988 mrs thatchers government banned british tv and radio 
from broadcasting interviews with the outlawed irish republican 
army its legal political arm sinn fein and with various protestant 
paramilitary groups in northern ireland 
trethowan was knighted by queen elizabeth ii in 1980 in 
recognition of his services to television journalism 
his first marriage ended in divorce he leaves his second wife

mayor xavier suarez says he regrets the way miami 
handled nelson mandelas visit but black activists say they will 
keep boycotting the city until he apologizes for refusing to honor 
the antiapartheid leader 
if its gotten you to the point where you regret it then why 
dont you just go ahead and say im sorry i apologize we 
screwed up we messed up now till you do that then it is not 
acceptable said the rev victor curry 
city officials refused to honor mandela during visit in june 
because the south african activist had praised fidel castro 
moammar gadhafi and yasser arafat miamis cubanamericans were 
especially upset over mandelas embrace of castro 
words can barely begin to describe the pain i feel over the 
division which has occurred since nelson mandela visited this 
community suarez breaking in long silence on the issue said in 
a statement i search for a formula that adequately expresses my 
regret that the matter was not handled better 
suarez did not use the words apologize or im sorry 
asked later why not he said the problem with that statement is 
that you are admitting that theres things you did that you 
shouldnt have done 
and frankly its very difficult for me to conceive of anything 
that we could have done better and of course we dont want to 
get into the whole symbolic issue of what it means to quoteunquote 
apologize under a demand he said 
the perceived snub of mandela prompted black leaders on july 17 
to start a boycott that has cost the city up to 25 million in 
tourism and convention business getting an apology from city

spending on aerospace weapons and employment 
in the industry are expected to decline further despite the massive 
military buildup in the persian gulf a trade association executive 
says 
but a respectable level of defense activity will remain 
said don fuqua president of the aerospace industries association 
the outlook is les than rosy but not as dismal as some have 
painted it he told the aias annual forecast luncheon wednesday 
aerospace employment has fallen almost 70000 this year to 125 
million by years end and will decline by an additional l30000 
more in 1991 fuqua said he predicted that aerospace sales to the 
defense department will dip to the lowest level since 1982 and 
that 1991 will mark the fourth straight year of declining defense 
business 
it is clear that annual funding will fall considerably below 
current levels fuqua said it is not likely that the middle 
east situation will appreciably change plans for downsizing the 
peacetime military establishment 
fuqua a former member of congress said there is a limit to how 
much the united states can reduce its military force 
it is now apparent to most people that the easing of eastwest 
tensions does not allow us to trade our swords for plowshares he 
said 
iraqi president saddam hussein may have done a major service to 
us security by reminding our nation that there is a lot of 
potential for trouble from sources other than the soviet union 
fuqua said 
the association which represents most of the major companies in 
the aerospace industry said 1990 sales would total a record 1314 
billion a 12 percent increase over the previous year 
he also said 
new orders for aircraft and aerospace systems fell from 164 
billion in 1989 to 136 billion in 1990 the first decline in total 
new orders since 1981 
exports set a record of 368 billion and sales abroad lowered 
the us trade deficit by 26 billion 
commercial transport aircraft sales were above 22 billion and 
the backlog of orders was more than 100 billion as of sept 30 
the industrys profit will rebound from a sharp drop in the 
previous year to a billiondollar gain in 1990 and a total profit 
of 485 billion fuqua said thats well below the average for 
all us manufacturing corporations 
a major question beyond 1991 fuqua said is the health of the 
worlds airlines and their ability to finance the aircraft they 
need to grow and to replace older aircraft 
fuel costs soaring because of the gulf crisis have not been 
offset by fare increases and traffic growth is slowing 
we must assume that the airlines difficulties are for the 
most part temporary and that they will be able to finance their 
aircraft requirements fuqua said

when european community leaders meet this week 
the stubborn and blunt margaret thatcher will be absent for the 
first time in 11 years replaced by a mildmannered man determined 
to avoid confrontation 
john major britains new conservative prime minister has 
pledged to change the combative style but not the substance of 
british policy 
the twoday rome summit which begins on friday is set to 
launch the community on mrs thatchers nightmare a drive led by 
france and germany toward a western europe unified both politcally 
and economically 
we will not be deterred either from saying what we believe to 
be wrong or pressing what we believe to be right by the cry 
that we are insufficiently european major 47 said after 
succeeding mrs thatcher two weeks ago 
but already there are signs that britain is toning down its 
bitter opposition to plans for a single currency and for close 
political ties that could turn the 12nation community into a sort 
of united states of europe 
in a key policy shift this week britain said the community 
should have a formal role in security an idea mrs thatcher found 
unacceptable because it would exclude the united states 
mrs thatcher also vehemently rejected a single currency on 
grounds that it is both impracticable and would diminish national 
sovereignty major talks more carefully about resisting an 
imposed single currency which the 11 other community members 
adopted at the last summit in late october in rome 
mrs thatchers furious denunciation of the idea precipitated 
her downfall her deputy sir geoffrey howe accused her of 
endangering britains national interests and resigned provoking a 
leadership challenge 
major the first british prime minister to grow up after world 
war ii sounds more at ease than 65yearold mrs thatcher with the 
idea of britain closely wedded to a continent dominated by germany 
however new political union proposals put forward last week by 
frances president francois mitterrand and chancellor helmut kohl 
of germany appear as unacceptable to major as they were to mrs 
thatcher 
these include plans for the community to control health and 
social services widening the powers of the 518member european 
parliament now mainly a frum for discussion and drastically 
curtailing the right of veto by individual nations 
majors aides acknowledge his opposition but appear determined 
to avoid isolation we see it as a welcome contribution said 
one senior british official of the frenchgerman plan we see no 
particular reason why there should be any problem 
proeuropeans britons are delighted seeing this weeks summit 
as a new opportunity for britain to get back into a europe of 
compromises and consensus 
still thatcher supporters in the deeply split conservative 
party are deeply suspicious 
we have to make up our minds whether we want to be a 
selfgoverning nation or whether we want to be part of a united 
states of europe you cant fudge this one legislator tony 
favell said in a television interview 
favell resigned in september as majors main parliamentary aide 
in protest after mrs thatcher linked the pound sterling to the 
other major community currencies 
whatever happens mrs thatcher the conservative veteran of 
dozens of lone confrontations who the smaller nations often 
secretly admired but seldom publicly backed will be missed 
they are not going to have the battles and i tell you what 
some of them have been thinking theyre going to have to make some 
of the points ive been making and its not going to be nearly as 
much fun she said before stepping down

a senior pentagon official criticized last 
week in an internal report for ignoring warnings about poor 
mismanagement of the navys 50 billion stealth aircraft program 
says he is resigning 
john a betti undersecretary of defense for acquisition said 
wednesday he would leave effective dec 31 he said he was quitting 
before jan 1 so he would not be covered by new ethics laws that 
place tougher postemployment restrictions on government officials 
bettis resignation letter and defense secretary dick cheneys 
acceptance did not mention the controversy over the navys a12 
avenger the radareluding plane being developed to replace 
carrierbased a6 fighterbombers 
speaking privately two pentagon officials said betti a former 
ford motor co official had been thinking for some time about 
returning to the private sector but that the timing of his decision 
likely was affected by the a12 controversy 
one official said cheneys plans to slash the responsibilities 
of the job which betti has held 16 months also was a factor 
bettis office referred calls to a defense department 
spokeswoman who said she had no information on whether betti 
already had lined up a new job there was no immediate word on 
candidates to replace him 
in a report released last week department inspector general 
susan crawford said betti had been told by a deputy of significant 
problems in the program but failed to report the conclusions to 
cheney and other senior pentagon officials 
instead mr betti relied on general assurances which he 
invited from the contractor and prior navy assurances that the 
a12 development contract would be completed within ceiling 
costs crawfords report said we find mr bettis failure 
especially troubles in view of a prior warning of cost growth 
on the a12 program 
cheney in the wake of crawfords report ordered his top deputy 
to recommend corrective actions including personnel changes if 
necessary 
last week the navy dismissed its top three officials in the 
program including two admirals for failing to disclose serious 
flaws in the aircrafts development 
the a12 is the navys top aircraft priority as the service 
moved to replace aging a6s by the middle of the decade 
cheney told congress in june that the program was on track just 
three weeks later the contractors general dynamics and mcdonnell 
douglas told the navy they could not deliver the first plane on 
time that costs were escalating and that they could not meet some 
performance standards 
the program is now a year behind schedule and 20 percent over 
the planned 47 billion cost 
crawford told congress last week that the us attorney in st 
louis where both mcdonnell douglas and general dynamics are based 
was conducting a criminal investigation of the program 
in a written statement betti said he believed his tenure 
included considerable progress in improving the pentagons 
oftcriticized purchasing system but he also said substantive 
lasting improvements in defense acquisition will not occur 
overnight rather it will be a long slow and arduous process 
requiring patience and constance of purpose 
the a12 controversy was not the first time betti has faced 
criticism 
in july he rejected demands by angry lawmakers that he accept a 
justice department recommendation that northrop corp be barred 
from pentagon business for its criminal conviction on charges it 
faked tests involving nuclear cruise missiles 
at the same time betti acknowledged that he had not reviewed 
evidence from several federal investigations of northrops conduct 
he also admitted he was unaware the military had repeatedly waived 
contract requirements in the cruise missile program even after 
allegations of misconduct arose and a federal prosecutor warned 
that such waivers could harm the governments case

management said after bush signed the executive order now hes 
delivered 
bushs order provides a 41 percent acrosstheboard raise for

area according to opm statistics the number of workers in the new 
york region was not immediately available 
bushs own annual salary remains frozen at 200000 but other 
top officials got hefty pay raises

judiciary are in for a raise associate justices of the supreme 
court will receive 153600 appeals court judges 132700

costofliving adjustment in exchange for forgoing speech 
honoraria the senators passed up the big pay raise but can still 
draw speech fees up to a maximum of about 27500 
house members earned 96600 this year while senators were paid 
98400 
raising the lid on the lawmakers pay also ratchets up the civil 
service pay scales grade 18 civil servants the top scale will be 
paid up to 97317 compared to a current maximum of 78200

the head of the federal mediation and 
conciliation service says he may try again to spur negotiations 
between the new york daily news and its striking unions despite a 
day that brought no movement 
im going to just wait a day or two and see what develops 
bernard e delury said wednesday 
delury spent all day wednesday shuttling between negotiators for 
the daily news and the unions which had agreed to meet with him 
but not with each other asked afterward whether there had been any 
movement on the issues separating both sides delury said its 
been a moving day but bottom line no theyre still quite 
separated in reaching an agreement 
the problem was the nine unions want to bargain as a group and 
the company wants to bargain with them individually delury said 
weve tried to mediate that particular issue all day he 
said 
delury said the unions wanted to discuss their common issues 
namely job security and permanent replacement workers 
theodore kheel a labor lawyer advising the unions said the 
company has hired 800 permanent replacement workers so far some 
2300 workers have been on strike since oct 25 
one hopeful sign from wednesdays session was that both sides 
agreed to be recalled by delury if he exercises that option 
delury said the next session would probably take place in new york 
george mcdonald president of the allied printing trades 
council said he was discouraged that company representatives 
robert ballow and ed gold would not meet with the unions as a 
group 
i think thats outrageous he said its another charade 
on the part of the news and a pure sign they dont want to reach 
any agreement 
asked whether the situation had worsened mcdonald said it 
just hasnt changed 
the daily news representatives declined to meet with reporters 
after wednesdays session 
members of the negotiation teams began arriving at the services 
headquarters shortly after 9 am union representatives entered by 
the front door while management negotiators used a garage entrance 
on tuesday a senate subcommittee held a hearing on the strike 
in new york and the papers parent the tribune co held a board 
meeting in chicago 
after the board meeting publisher james hoge said the daily 
news would continue to publish as long as the tabloid showed 
progress in regaining circulation and advertisers 
there had been speculation that the board of directors would 
decide to close the paper and cut the parent companys losses 
hoge said the daily news circulation had recently increased to 
580000 after the strike began circulation dropped from 109 
million 
hoge has said the newspaper has lost 115 million from 1979 
through last year and that figure could reach 200 million by the 
end of this year 
he said the paper could become profitable if it reaches 
reasonable settlements with the striking unions 
at the new york hearing catholic cardinal john oconnor said he 
supported a proposed bill to block the hiring of permanent 
replacement workers 
oconnor said he feared that if unions are broken or badly 
bent in the daily news strike it would be a severe blow to 
unionism throughout the united states 
the hearing before the senate labor subcommittee on labor and 
human resources was chaired by sen howard metzenbaum dohio 
metzenbaum has introduced legislation that would amend the 
national labor relations act to prohibit the hiring of permanent 
replacements for striking workers the legislation would not 
prohibit the hiring of temporary replacements

a published report today says a troubled 
boston bank used treasury tax deposits to bolster its financial 
position 
the new york times reported that the bank of new england appears 
to have been able to reduce its borrowings from the federal reserve 
from 2 billion to 14 million in april after 18 billion in tax 
payments flowed into the treasurys account at the bank the 
newspaper said 
those tax payments were largely drawn back to the treasury over 
the next three months 
two treasury spokeswomen said wednesday night the bank had 
received no special treatment that they were aware of 
borrowings from the federal reserve available to any bank that 
is a member of the federal reserve system carry a stigma if a bank 
relies on them the fed charges a premium interest rate if those 
loans last more than 30 days 
about 200 banks including the bank of new england are used by 
the treasury to hold excess cash for a few days at a time said 
lenora cross spokeswoman for the office of comptroller of the 
currency this cash earns onequarter point below a money market 
interest rate she said 
these accounts are volatile she said 
when excess cash is put into these banks it is done randomly 
according to the collateral the bank has deposited in advance at 
the regional federal reserve bank a bank that wants more treasury 
deposits can get them automatically by putting up more collateral 
a treasury statement wednesday night said treasury gave no 
special treatment to the bank of new england all treasury funds 
placed with banks are fully collateralized collateral is 
valued at least as conservatively as the fed values collateral 
for its loans to banks 
the statement was read by an official who would not permit use 
of her name she and ms cross said they did not know what 
decisions the bank had made in recent months about depositing 
collateral with the federal reserve bank of boston or why those 
decisions were made 
bank of new england which lost 1 billion last year as a result 
of bad real estate loans increased its treasury accounts at the 
end of the third quarter from 296 million last year to 975 
million this year the newspaper said

jr does not have a listed telephone number

delta air lines is offering its traditional 
winter specials earlier than usual because of slow business in the 
travel industry 
it looks like its happened a little bit earlier now which is 
telling me bookings are a little bit softer than expected 
raymond e neidl an airline analyst with dillon read amp co said 
wednesday 
delta will award a free ticket to any frequent flier who 
completes four round trips or two round trips with plane changes on 
coach fares between dec 15 and march 15 the bonuses are 
redeemable between may 15 and dec 31 1991 
the program also offers passengers firstclass upgrades rather 
than free trips

farmers who lost crops this year to bad 
weather can begin applying for lowinterest loans the farmers home 
administration announced after a week of lobbying by members of 
congress 
fmha spokesman joe oneill said wednesday that the agency would 
begin accepting and processing loan applications immediately but 
that it would be at least two weeks before the loans could actually 
be made 
congress this year rather than approving a direct disaster aid 
package for farmers who lost crops to bad weather voted instead to 
make 600 million available in lowinterest emergency loans 
congress also waived a federal prohibition against emergency 
disaster loans to producers if crop insurance was available 
members of congress say they have been waiting for agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutter to issue regulations implementing the 
waiver so farmers could apply for a loan 
asked if the fmha was responding to congressional pressure 
oneill said the draft of the regulations had already been 
written before we heard of additional capitol hill interest of 
course were trying to get them out as soon as possible since it 
was in the farm bill 
but sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said last week that he had been 
informed by members of yeutters staff that farmers would not 
receive the benefit of the waiver for a month or more 
bentsen complained that farmers were in the process of making 
financing arrangements for next year and that they and their 
bankers are on a cycle of production that is dictated by nature 
not by federal regulations they cannot wait another month not 
even for a cabinet official

two fundraising committees for former house 
speaker jim wright have acknowledged that they accepted an illegal 
contribution from a texas businessman implicated in the savings and 
loan scandal according to the federal election commission 
fec spokesman scott moxley said wednesday that wrights 
principal fundraising committee and his leadership political 
action committee have agreed to pay penalties totaling 1500 to 
settle the case 
wright a fort worth democrat who was house majority leader at 
the time was on his way to haiti wednesday and could not be 
reached for comment a spokesman said 
at issue was wrights use of a chartered airplane that 
crisscrossed texas between june 30 and july 2 1985 to promote a 
cowtown jamboree in fort worth the fundraiser sought to raise 
1 million for wrights principal campaign committee the wright 
appreciation committee and his leadership pac the majority 
congress committee 
under the conciliation agreement the two committees 
acknowledged they accepted an illegal contribution from the owner 
of the plane kenneth c hood and that they failed to disclose the 
receipt of the contribution the committees also acknowledged a 
violation stemming from the way they repaid hood for the use of the 
plane 46 months later moxley said 
wright repaid hood 8050 for the use of the plane in april 
1989 in the midst of a house ethics committee investigation that 
led to his resignation a month later at the time wright said the 
failure to pay the bill was an oversight

driedout christmas trees that used to go 
into the trash are going into louisiana wetlands by the thousands 
to save miles of ecologically sensitive land that is eaten away by 
erosion each year 
last year scientists placed 12000 old christmas trees along 
the lake pontchartrain shoreline in st charles parish 
the project worked so well that it is being expanded across the 
state and 16 of louisianas 19 coastal parishes have agreed to 
institute tree recycling programs said bill good of the state 
department of natural resources 
around the country recycling projects have sprung up involving 
trees that normally are kept in the home for a couple of weeks 
before being tossed into the nations rapidly filling landfills 
in vermont indiana and illinois thousands of old christmas 
trees have been ground up in recent years and used as fertilizer 
for parks gardens and lawns 
on lake pontchartrain environmentalist milton cambre said the 
old trees put there last year have begun to collect sediment and 
spur the growth of vegetation which in turn will act as a buffer 
between the lakes waves and the wetland soil 
louisiana loses 35 to 40 square miles of wetlands a year it has 
40 percent of the nations wetlands and 80 percent of the wetlands 
loss 
scientists say the project also reduces sediment in lakes 
improving water clarity and promoting aquatic vegetation which in 
turn attracts wildlife 
parishes in the tree recycling project are each receiving 
10000 from the state wetlands conservation and restoration fund 
in jefferson parish plans are to collect 13000 trees this year 
for use at 44 sites st tammany parish hopes to collect 4000 
trees for use at one site 
rod emmer of the coalition to restore coastal louisiana said the 
programs give people a way to do their part to preserve the 
environment 
even if you just put your christmas tree out by the street 
for pickup youve done something he said

ecologists and the leftist opposition are 
ridiculing the conservative governments green plan for 
protecting the environment as muddled ecobabble that lacks 
both teeth and funding 
mining and manufacturing industries were generally pleased with 
the program which was announced with fanfare wednesday by 
environment minister robert de cotret 
from our point of view its a fairly good document said 
paul summers of the canadian manufacturing association 
we were concerned there would be some sort of carbon tax or 
environment tax in general said george miller president of the 
mining association of canada it was good they deferred those 
things until they could study them more carefully 
the plan pledges 3 billion through 1996 to clean up and protect 
canadas air water forests soil wildlife and fisheries but as 
critics quickly pointed out not a cent of spending has been 
approved by the cabinet 
it wasnt green and it wasnt a plan said dan mcdermott of 
greenpeace the environmental organization as kai millyard of 
friends of the earth said it would have been a revolutionary 
document if it had been released in 1975 it has no clear goal no 
clear vision 
there were whole sections of it where issues were dealt with 
in an extremely cursory fashion or else tangled in 
incomprehensibility 
canada with an area of 6195192 square miles and fewer than 27 
million people has a great interest in keeping its vast forests 
lakes and arctic region free of pollution 
as with most nations and with a little help from its southern 
neighbor canada is beset with acid rain dying lakes dwindling 
forests and mountains of garbage and industrial waste it must deal 
with the struggle between environment and economic development 
the need for more electric power minerals paper wood against the 
need to preserve the ecology 
as one columnist put it de cotrets plan is like a bottle of 
champagne that has been open for a while the bottle looks 
impressive from the outside and theres something sweet about the 
contents but theres no fizz or pop 
the 173page document lays out eight areas for funding 
850 million for reducing pollutionrelated health problems 
575 million for stabilizing gas emissions 
500 million to aid native and environmental groups 
350 million for forests and farmland 
275 million for federal operations 
175 million to set aside 12 percent of canada as protected 
space 
175 million for emergency preparedness 
100 million for protection of northern ecosystems 
liberal opposition leader herb gray said the plan was just an 
empty shell because not one nickel of that money has been 
approved by cabinet for specific projects listed in the green 
plan 
the toronto star said the government of prime minister brian 
mulroney missed a golden opportunity to increase its sagging 
popularity now at a mere 14 percent in the polls 
the governments green plan is not just a disappointing 
collection of vague promises and recycled plans it is a testament 
to ottawas failure to capitalize on the one issue that unites 
canadians their desire to protect the environment the newspaper 
said in a commentary 
more than one critic noted the plan was long on verbs like 
monitor study assess and analyze and short on 
verbs like implement begin and establish 
this government is not going to take on the fossil fuel 
industry said mcdermott you cant deal with carbon dioxide 
and global warming unless you cut down and phase out fossil fuels 
they are looking to cap co2 emissions not cutting them back 
polls show canadians are serious about preserving their 
environment and are prepared to pay for it through higher taxes and 
prices 
but the industries dont want to hear about changing their 
ways said mcdermott 
for environmentalists tomorrow will be no different than 
yesterday 
none of the agenda items has changed said mcdermott all 
the green plan has done is highlight how bad the situation is

decorate your house with more than a 
strand of holiday lights in this city and your electric bill will 
read 000 
for the fourth consecutive december altamont is paying 90 
percent of its residents electric bills and the city will throw 
in the remaining 10 percent for anyone who enters its annual 
holiday lighting contest 
anybody who hears about it is amazed said helen moll city 
clerk for the farming community of 2400 they dont know how we 
can manage it 
the free electricity became available in 1987 altamont a 
member of a power distribution cooperative with several other 
cities had wanted to drop out because it had found a cheaper 
supplier to keep the cooperative together the other cities agreed 
to pay altamont the 7000 a year the city would have saved 
the money is used to cover the cost of residents december 
lighting bills 
it was an easy way to give a little back to the community when 
the christmas bills came due and to help decorate the city at the 
same time said donald wendling the citys electrical services 
commissioner 
it has also revived a threatened yuletide ritual 
were a small german community with a tradition of christmas 
and it has been a tradition here for years to decorate wendling 
said but when the energy crisis hit in the 70s it kind of died 
off 
the rebates from the cooperative end after next year however 
and wendling said he doesnt know if the discounts will continue 
past 1991 
in the meantime almost everyone in town is lighting up the 
house last year moll said 600 of the citys 800 residential 
customers entered the contest and got the full december discount 
which averaged 55 to 65 
anyone who puts up more than a string of holiday lights is 
eligible 
moll said the decorations have made an impression on 
outoftowners recalling the words of a visitor from chicago he 
told us we had the prettiest town he ever saw

prosecutors have gone 0for3 against reputed 
mafia boss john gotti since 1986 but say they have a charge this 
time that is likely to stick ordering the 1985 hit that lifted the 
dapper don to power 
the case against him includes crystal clear audio tapes and 
a witness who claims gotti boasted about planning the rubout of his 
reputed predecessor as boss of the gambino family big paul 
castellano authorities said 
this is our best effort so far said james m fox head of 
the fbis new york office 
gotti 50 was accused in a racketeering indictment wednesday of 
ordering four murders including castellanos and conspiring to 
kill a fifth person he was also accused of gambling loansharking 
obstruction and tax evasion 
he pleaded innocent with three alleged associates and was 
returned to jail where he was held since his arrest tuesday us 
district judge i leo glasser did not grant bail for gotti and two 
others and set a hearing for monday 
gotti has been indicted three times in recent years on state and 
federal charges and beat the rap each time earning the nickname 
the teflon don 
his lawyer bruce cutler denounced the indictment as a vendetta 
by publicityhungry authorities and denied gotti is involved in 
organized crime 
this is our fourth indictment in five years cutler said in 
arguing for his release on bail your honor they cant convict 
him he shouldnt be doing life on the installment plan 
the reputed mobster a swaggering barrelchested known for his 
custommade doublebreasted suits maintains hes a salesman for a 
plumbing company and a company that sells zippers and hangers to 
the fashion industry 
his real job is boss of the most powerful crime family in this 
country said us attorney andrew j maloney hes a murderer 
hes not a folk hero 
the indictment was the first official attempt to prove gotti was 
near the scene when castellano was shot to death outside a 
steakhouse in december 1985 
it is fair to say we have a witness who places him near the 
site maloney said declining to say how close gotti allegedly 
was 
prosecutors and fbi officials speaking on the condition they not 
be identified told the new york times the witness was a passerby 
not an informer 
some of the previous failures to convict gotti have been blamed 
on murky audio tapes but fox said that wont be a problem this 
time describing them as crystal clear gotti wont be 
pleased when he hears them fox said 
also arrested were frank frankie loc locascio 58 salvatore 
sammy bull gravano 45 and thomas gambino 61 gambino is the 
son of the late carlo gambino the patriach of the crime family 
that bears his name 
to my knowledge this is the first time that we have taken 
down the entire hierarchy of an organizedcrime family the boss 
the underboss the consigliere fox said of gotti locascio and 
gravano respectively 
prosecutors said they would play tapes at mondays bail hearing 
to support their contention that gotti locascio and gravano are a 
threat to witnesses in the case if set free 
a top witness expected to testify in the case is phillip crazy 
phil leonetti a former mafia underboss of philadelphias scarfo 
family who told investigators gotti bragged about planning the 
castellano slaying 
investigators say gotti had his former boss killed because of 
castellanos prohibition punishable by death on gambino family 
involvement in narcotics

the security council has once again 
postponed a vote on a resolution endorsing a middle east peace 
conference this time at the request of the soviet union 
deputy soviet ambassador valentin lozinskiy sought the 
fiveday delay so soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze can 
first confer with plo chairman yasser arafat diplomats said 
shevardnadze who was in washington on wednesday meeting 
separately with israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir and president 
bush will meet arafat on friday in ankara turkey said the 
diplomats who spoke privately 
diplomats said shevardnadze would seek to pressure arafat to 
distance the plo from iraq which has been championing the 
palestinian homeland issue since invading kuwait on aug 2 
iraqi president saddam hussein has sought to link the issue to a 
settlement of the persian gulf crisis 
the united states has thus been struggling to remove from the 
proposed resolution any language endorsing a middle east peace 
conference fearing it would look like a concession to iraq 
the united states is in a diplomatic bind 
israel which the united states has traditionally supported 
opposes any call for a conference but a us veto of such a 
conferenceendorsing resolution could jeopardize the us relations 
with arab members of the coalition arrayed against iraq 
the delay on a vote until monday will give the united states and 
the nonaligned nations on the security council more time to try to 
work out a compromise 
the united states circulated a draft resolution on wednesday in 
which the paragraph endorsing the conference was taken out and put 
in a separate nonbinding statement 
but nonaligned nations on the council rejected the us draft 
the yemeni ambassador a cosponsor of the resolution said 
that has been a suggestion but we have not moved an inch 
us ambassador thomas pickering seemed to despair when asked if 
it was possible to pass any resolution i dont know i have 
hopes that we can we have been seeking for a long time a mutually 
agreeable text in good faith 
the situation became more complicated wednesday when france 
announced it could not support any resolution that did not contain 
the call for a peace conference france did not indicate whether it 
would cast a veto however 
a vote on the resolution has been put off six times in a week 
on wednesday nine of the security councils 15 members including 
the united states voted to postpone four voted against and 
france and china abstained 
the israelis are adamantly opposed to the peace conference 
proposal 
they say they will not accept any imposed settlement and fear a 
peace conference would force them into a landforpeace deal 
with their arab neighbors they say they want bilateral talks with 
their arab adversaries 
saddam says he will withdraw from kuwait only in the context of 
a comprehensive middle east peace conference that would address all 
problems in the region

some viewers complain theres too much trash 
on television channel 59 in suburban pittsburgh has garbage 24 
hours a day 
its the parking lot channel a flickering television image 
recorded by a security camera outside the adelphia cable tv co 
the buildings garbage bin appears to serve as host of the live 
show around the clock regular guests include garbage collectors 
and rows of parked cars 
channel 59 available only to an estimated 5700 adelphia 
subscribers in bethel park was created about six weeks ago after a 
thief took cable gear from trucks parked in the lot adelphia 
operations manager chuck redpath said wednesday 
employees conceived the idea of televising live from the parking 
lot hoping robbers would stay away if they knew a camera was 
watching company managers also figured that if the thieves 
returned police might see them on the new channel 
adelphia cable set up lights to improve the quality of the 
picture and installed a cheap blackandwhite camera then wired 
the camera to the unused channel 
bethel park police though said they dont tune in 
watching the parking lot channel is like watching that thing 
that sells jewelry or whatever said detective ron evans 
referring to a shopping network 
fortyeight other channels with wider appeal reach about 32000 
adelphia subscribers in western pennsylvania the companys channel 
56 for example mind extension university offers telecourses for 
college credit 
then theres public access channel 7 featuring big brush 
painting with one of adelphias qualitycontrol inspectors chuck 
strink 
theres no charge for channel 59 and so far its a small 
matter if nobody watches the unblinking lens of channel 59 seems 
to be doing the job 
as a matter of fact since we started it weve had no problems 
whatsoever redpath said

scientists today reported some of the strongest 
evidence yet that red meat significantly raises the risk of colon 
cancer 
the research found that people who eat beef pork or lamb every 
day are more than twice as likely to get colon cancer as those who 
avoid red meat even those who have meat occasionally raise their 
risk somewhat the study said 
the findings published in todays new england journal of 
medicine came as no surprise to health experts who have been 
urging reduced red meat consumption for years because of its links 
to heart disease and cancer but the new study solidifies beliefs 
about its cancer effects 
moderate red meat intake is certainly better than large 
amounts but its quite possible that no red meat intake is even 
better said dr walter c willett who directed the study at 
brigham and womens hospital in boston 
another nonsurprise in the study of 88751 nurses from 1980 to 
1986 was the finding that switching to fish and chicken helped 
reduce the risk of colon cancer 
that has practical implications because it will be easier for 
people to increase chicken and fish consumption rather than 
becoming strict vegetarians willett said 
colon cancer is the secondleading cancer killer after lung 
cancer an estimated 110000 new cases will be diagnosed in the 
united states this year 
in the study 150 of the women studied got colon cancer 
although all the participants were women the researchers said 
their conclusions probably apply to men too 
the study provides some of the most direct evidence that there 
is likely to be a payoff in cancer risk by reducing our consumption 
of animal fat willett said 
the eating recommendations of major health organizations already 
emphasize cutting down on red meat and other sources of saturated 
fat 
dr peter greenwald of the national cancer institute cautioned 
against interpreting the report to mean people should stop eating 
red meat entirely 
meat has important nutrient value he said the message 
should be to cut down not to cut out 
dr david hurt a nutritionist with the national livestock and 
meat board in chicago said the study is outdated beef is 27 
percent leaner and pork is 31 percent leaner than in 1986 when the 
nurses data were gathered he said 
i dont see how these numbers can relate to todays 
situation he said of the study meat today is not the same as 
it was then 
among the boston researchers findings 
women who ate beef pork or lamb as a main dish every day were 
2 times more likely to get colon cancer than were those who ate it 
less than once a month 
for those who consumed meat less frequently the risk was 
lower for instance women who ate meat between once a month and 
once a week had about 40 percent higher risk than the abstainers 
the risk was about 50 percent higher for those who ate meat two to 
four times a week and 80 percent higher for those who had it five 
or six times 
processed meats and liver also were linked to increased colon 
cancer risk 
women who ate skinless chicken every day had only about half as 
much risk as those who almost never ate chicken 
low consumption of fiber which many health experts believe may 
contribute to colon cancer was not linked with the disease in this 
study none of the participants were high fiber consumers so no 
strong conclusions in this area could be drawn willet said 
diets high in vegetable fats were not linked with cancer 
either neither were whole milk cheese and ice cream which are 
other sources of animal fat 
until now most of the evidence implicating red meat in colon 
cancer came from comparisons of people living in different parts of 
the world in western countries where meat is plentiul the 
disease is up to 10 times more common than in many nations in the 
far east and developing world

parliament has approved a new 
division of powers between the federal government and the countrys 
two regional republics settling a lingering crisis and saving 
national unity 
deputies on wednesday voted 237 to 24 in favor of a 
constitutional amendment handing broad economic powers to the czech 
and slovak republics 
the federal government retains jurisdiction over defense 
foreign policy economic and fiscal strategy 
the decision was a compromise reached after slovak leaders 
threatened to proclaim the sovereignty of slovak law over federal 
legislation if their demands for economic control were not met 
slovakia the countrys eastern and more rural third spent 
centuries under hungarian domination 
many slovaks feel they exchanged hungarian rule for czech 
domination when the two nations who speak very similar languages 
united in 1918 
nationalism and separatism have grown steadily in slovakia since 
communist rule crumbled last year 
after a heated twoday debate deputies decided to exclude the 
controversial issue of ownership of oil pipelines from the 
constitutional amendment passed wednesday leaving the decision to 
parliamentary jurisdiction 
slovak leaders have demanded that two separate shareholding 
companies be appointed to oversee the vital pipeline that connects 
czechoslovakia with its sole supplier of oil the soviet union 
czechs are suspicious that this would give slovaks vital control 
of energy resources flowing to the western czech lands 
late tuesday the czech and slovak regional parliaments reached 
an agreement to set up a single transnational company overseeing 
the pipeline 
the federal parliament retained the right to interfere in energy 
distribution in times of emergency the state news agency ctk 
reported 
the federation also retains the right to decide on nationality 
issues 
following weeks of demonstrations in november the slovak 
government passed legislation allowing the 600000 ethnic 
hungarians in slovakia the use their language in areas where they 
represent more than 20 percent of the population 
settling another controversy the federal parliament also 
honored a demand from the slovaks that the governorship of the 
central bank rotate annually between czechs and slovaks 
parliaments twoday debate opened monday with an unprecedented 
speech by president vaclav havel who asked the legislature to 
grant him broader powers to defuse constitutional crises 
although havel did not spell out what his demands were vice 
premier pavel rychetsky said they might include veto power over the 
parliaments decisions 
the request by the czech president met with strong slovak 
opposition wednesday and may face tough debate in the parliament 
when it is submitted for discussion next week 
havel also urged that a constitutional court be set up and 
referenda allowed to settle future constitutional disputes 
although havels request for extra powers is unpopular with the 
slovaks his forceful intervention apparently spurred parliament to 
solve the crisis that has threatened to tear czechoslovakia apart 
in recent months 
havel is currently on a fourday official visit to spain and 
portugal and returns to prague on friday

the three biggest earthquakes of the past 150 
years near san francisco bay were preceded by unusually frequent 
moderate quakes suggesting a possible means of prediction 
scientists reported today 
in each case the moderate shocks occurred over several years on 
faults near the one that finally produced the major quake 
scientists said 
if the pattern proves predictive scientists may be able to give 
a percentage risk of a major bay area earthquake occuring within a 
span of a few years to a decade study coauthor lynn sykes said in 
a recent interview 
that would be more precise than the 30year interval now 
frequently used he said 
sykes is a professor of geological sciences at columbia 
university in new york and a researcher at columbias 
lamontdoherty geological observatory he and colleague steven 
jaume present their observations in todays issue of the british 
journal nature 
the idea is certainly not new by any means but the studys 
method is a different way of showing a previously recognized 
pattern commented bruce bolt professor of seismology at the 
university of california at berkeley 
the columbia scientists measured prior seismic activity near the 
major quakes by recording seismic moment which is essentially the 
strength of lowfrequency seismic waves given off by earthquakes 
the researchers added up the cumulative seismic moment from 
quakes measuring at least 5 on the richter scale over 35 years 
preceding each of three major quakes 
analysis showed that this total rose sharply in the 11 years 
before the major quake of 1989 in the nine years before a large 
quake in 1906 and in the four years preceding a major quake in 
1868 the fouryear interval is probably too small because too 
little data were available the researchers wrote

president saddam hussein issued an 
amnesty today for iraqis who fled the country during its 198088 
war with iran governmentrun newspapers reported 
diplomats in baghdad said the decree apparently was aimed at 
facilitating the return of thousands of iraqi servicemen who are in 
iran and want to return but fear reprisal for desertion and siding 
with the enemy during the war 
the newspapers said the pardon will include army deserters and 
activists wanted for political crimes committed in iraq before 
their flight 
iraq considers membership of opposition parties and unauthorized 
groups as political crimes 
a decree by the ruling revolution command council and signed by 
saddam said those who want to benefit from the pardon should return 
to iraq within two months but students abroad can stay until they 
finish their studies 
western diplomats say as many as 100000 iraqis deserted the 
army during the iraniraq war many fled to neighboring countries 
including iran 
there was no way to determine what the response might be the 
penalty for desertion in iraq is execution and thousands of the 
iraniraq war deserters were shot after capture often in front of 
their families or military units 
earlier blanket amnesties for kurdish rebels and other political 
dissidents have not attracted many of saddams opponents back to 
iraq

tons of badly needed imported food are languishing 
in soviet ports kgb officials reported today as they cracked down 
on profiteering that they say is contributing to the national food 
shortage 
food stuck in warehouses and ships can be easy prey for corrupt 
workers who can sell to the speculators who capitalize on 
shortages in governmentrun stores maj gen alexander n 
karbainov told a news conference at kgb headquarters 
president mikhail s gorbachev has ordered the kgb and the 
interior ministry to combat profiteering after serious shortages 
hit moscow leningrad and other large cities 
the shortages also are blamed on an inefficient distribution 
system 
karbainov stressed that as far as the kgb can tell all food 
donated by the west has reached those who need it without falling 
into the hands of profiteers 
but the situation appeared quite different for food and other 
goods imported through normal channels according to figures 
released by karbainov and his aides 16 million tons of imported 
goods await unloading or shipment from ports including 11000 tons 
of food 
the situation is much the same for foreign and domestically 
produced food shipped by rail kgb chairman vladimir kryuchkov said 
in an interview published today in the communist party daily 
pravda 
thousands of railway containers laden with important goods 
commodities and machinery are standing idle and unloaded this 
includes freight coming from abroad he said 
in certain areas whole trains are being simply abandoned on 
side tracks in the irkutsk area of siberia the number of such 
abandoned trains now stands at 52 he said 
while food is scarce in big russian cities it is much more 
plentiful in farmers markets throughout the country food supplies 
are much the same as last year in the countryside and most of the 
14 nonrussian republics according to officials and media reports 
karbainov in his news conference sought to temper a speech 
that kryuchkov made tuesday night kryuchkov said unidentified 
foreign powers were giving moral and material support to soviet 
radicals who were in turn exacerbating and taking advantage of 
food shortages for their own political ends 
the nationally televised speech struck a jarring note in light 
of the tons of food being sent to the soviet union by countries 
concerned that the food shortage could spark tumult that would 
jeopardize gorbachevs reforms 
asked whether evidence had been found that any foreign country 
had contributed to the food shortage karbainov replied as to 
the economic aspects there are no such facts 
but he said that there are regions in the country where 
destructive forces are at work and these people make the 
maximum use of shortages for political ends 
asked exactly which political forces were exploiting the food 
shortages he said this will take time to determine

president bush fired education secretary lauro 
cavazos because he did not make enough progress in education an 
area the president named as a high priority for his administration 
white house sources say 
chief of staff john h sununu personally informed cavazos of the 
firing a day before the secretarys departure was announced 
wednesday said one of the sources an administration official who 
insisted on anonymity an education official with ties to the white 
house said cavazos had been given until the end of the month to 
quit 
several possible successors have been suggested with lynne 
cheney chairwoman of the national endowment for the humanities 
singled out as the frontrunner the national conservative 
foundation already has sent bush a letter recommending cheney 
deputy education secretary ted sanders is serving as acting 
secretary and sources said he has been lobbying for the 
nomination 
in his two years as education secretary cavazos was best known 
for promoting the idea of allowing parents to decide which school 
public or private their children will attend with public 
financing 
the first hispanicamerican to head a cabinet department he 
also advocated bilingual education curbing school dropouts and 
improving adult literacy 
sen claiborne pell dri said cavazos commitment to 
educational opportunities for minorities and the poor has been 
without question 
but one of the white house officials speaking only on condition 
of anonymity said cavazos was seen as lacking dynamism and not 
making enough progress in education an area bush designated as a 
high priority 
cavazos was out of town wednesday and let it be known he would 
not be back not even for the kind of personal departure appearance 
that bush made with other top officials who have left his 
administration an official said 
however the secretary was expected to keep a scheduled 
appearance saturday in west virginia 
the resignation announced at a cabinet meeting wednesday is 
effective saturday 
cavazos 63 the fourth person to serve as secretary of 
education gave neither a reason for his resignation nor details 
about his future plans said education department spokeswoman etta 
fielek 
many education officials even his harshest critics said it was 
apparent cavazos received little support from the white house 
the administration secretary cavazos served did not match his 
convictions with deeds that would have carried out the commitments 
implicit in president bushs desire to be an education president 
said robert h atwell president of the american council on 
education 
in that sense the administration was better served by 
secretary cavazos than he was by those in the white house atwell 
said 
richard f rosser president of the national association of 
independent colleges and universities said any crticisms there 
may have been of the secretary for not being more positive or 
forwardthinking would have to involve an examination of the role 
the white house played in either permitting this or not permitting 
this 
cavazos whose father was a cattle foreman at the king ranch in 
texas was president of texas tech when he took over the education 
department in the waning days of the reagan administration bush 
kept him in the job 
cavazos is the third major administration official to resign 
since october labor secretary elizabeth dole quit to join the 
american red cross and william bennett head of the office of 
national drug control policy stepped down and later was named 
chairman of the republican national committee 
keith geiger president of the national education association 
said cavazos proved to be a decent man with the interest of 
americas children at heart 
but albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers and a longtime critic of cavazos said basically it 
would be hard to tell what would have been different if we hadnt 
had a secretary of education at all during this period of time 
besides sanders and cheney others considered to be possible 
successors are former new jersey gov thomas kean rep patricia 
saiki a former schoolteacher who lost her november bid to unseat 
sen daniel akaka dhawaii and rep lynn martin who also has 
been mentioned as a possible successor to mrs dole 
educators already are listing qualities needed for the job 
richard miller executive director of the american association 
of school administrators said we need a person who can go to 
cabinet meetings and not just take marching orders but speak 
convincingly and forcefully at the highest levels of government 
about the educational impact of whatever is proposed 
south carolina gov carroll campbell a republican said i 
look forward to the appointment of a strong dedicated individual 
who shares the presidents commitment to excellence and 
diversity in education flexibility in managing schools and 
education dollars and accountability at all levels for actual 
student performance and results

five us diplomats from kuwait today abandoned their besieged 
embassy and flew to baghdad to join a last batch of americans 
leaving iraq and the occupied emirate aboard a uschartered iraqi 
jet 
officials said the diplomats and 25 other americans aboard the 
boeing 707 that landed in baghdad would be among 94 foreigners 
leaving in the afternoon on an iraqi airways flight to frankfurt 
germany in what was said to be the last charter plane carrying out 
foreign nationals 
us ambassador nathaniel howell barbara bodine the deputy 
chief of mission in kuwait and three other american diplomats from 
kuwait were whisked through the departure lounge and made no 
comment in baghdad 
they are in good spirits and good shape and ready to get back 
to the states and american embassy official said on condition of 
anonymity 
but while iraq was allowing the completion of a blanket hostage 
release announced one week ago it remained at odds with washington 
over when secretary of state james a baker iii can visit baghdad 
for talks on preventing war 
on wednesday the bush administration accused president saddam 
hussein of blocking any agreement the administration says iraqs 
insistence on a jan 12 date for the visit is too close to the jan 
15 deadline a un resolution has set for iraq to relinquish kuwait 
or face possible attack 
there is no disagreement over iraqs foreign minister tariq 
aziz meeting with president bush in washington on monday but the 
united states says it will not receive him unless a date has been 
set for bakers visit 
the bush administration has suggested any time between dec 20 
and jan 3 
also today algerian president chadli bendjedid left baghdad for 
iran after beginning a new arab peace mission the day before during 
talks with saddam 
among those waiting at the baghdad airport for todays flight to 
frankfurt were three families who missed a tuesday flight because 
the kuwaiti wives of americans had to obtain iraqi passports 
officials said 
the embassy had no estimate on the number of americans or other 
passengers who would fly out of the country today on the 
frankfurtbound charter 
state department spokesman richard boucher said in washington on 
wednesday that 15 americans would be aboard the flight 
officials in baghdad said that all others who wished to leave 
kuwait and iraq would do so by regular flights or by ground 
transportation 
in other laststage charter flights 78 japanese arrived in 
tokyo wednesday and 313 mostly british passengers landed in london 
on a chartered iraqi airways jet from baghdad 
iraq had barred thousands of foreigners from travel after its 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait it held hundreds of them mostly 
americans britons and japanese at strategic sites to deter a 
feared attack by usled forces sent to the region in response to 
the invasion 
about 188 americans have been evacuated from iraq and kuwait 
over the last week they include 70 people who were in hiding 86 
men kept as human shields and 32 private citizens who had found 
refuge in us compounds 
us officials estimate that about 500 americans most of them 
children with dual citizenship are remaining 
howell and his colleagues at the us embassy in kuwait defied 
iraqi orders to close in august gradually all but the british and 
americans removed their diplomats as iraq cut off utilities and 
posted soldiers outside the compounds 
britain has joined the united states in deciding to remove its 
remaining diplomats now that the last of both countries citizens 
are leaving kuwait 
britain says its embassy staff will leave in the next week 
on nov 30 a day after the un security council passed the 
useofforce resolution bush proposed the diplomatic exchange as a 
lastditch effort to avoid war 
iraq accepted the idea but boucher complained wednesday that 
baghdad continued to block agreement on dates 
said the state department spokesman we have offered 15 dates 
and iraq has offered none 
he said baker is willing to go to baghdad for a meeting on any 
one of the 15 days between dec 20 and jan 3 because we think 
these meetings are important and because we are serious about 
them

actress theresa saldana said the conviction 
of a scottish drifter for threatening her from prison should 
encourage other crime victims to fight for their rights 
a superior court jury on wednesday convicted arthur jackson 55 
on five felony counts of sending death threats in letters written 
in prison 
jackson was serving time for a knife attack on miss saldana 
outside her west hollywood apartment in 1982 
im absolutely thrilled that hes been found guilty miss 
saldana said outside court the verdicts should encourage crime 
victims to fight long and hard and dont back down when people 
tell you something is impossible 
jackson faces up to 14 years in prison he will be sentenced 
under a previously untested 1986 law barring release of felons who 
continue threatening victims the laws passage stemmed from the 
saldana case sentencing was scheduled for jan 8 
the actress best known for her supporting role in raging 
bull was seated in the front row of the courtroom and let out a 
small cry as the first verdict was read she embraced and kissed 
friends seated on either side of her 
jackson wearing his prison uniform showed no reaction to the 
verdicts 
miss saldana has devoted herself to the case since the stabbing 
attack 
ive been pretty much stigmatized as a victim which is 
understandable she said people have seen me crying on tv 
ive had to put my life ahead of my career 
the actress wept at trial as she told of jacksons death 
threats 
he swore on the ashes of his dead mother and the scars of 
theresa saldana that he would complete his mission of killing me 
she said 
prosecutors said jackson sent seven threatening letters in 1988 
from the state hospital in atascadero about 150 miles northwest of 
los angeles in san luis obispo county 
jackson testified that he attacked miss saldana to fulfill a 
mission to be executed at san quentin state prison 
the defendant is still on this murderous journey that 
began in 1981 in scotland deputy district attorney susan gruber 
said at trial his means for his own execution has been and still 
is the assassination of theresa saldana 
jacksons 14year prison sentence for the stabbing attack was 
halved because of good behavior 
when he finishes serving time for his latest conviction jackson 
will be turned over to the immigration and naturalization service 
for deportation on murder charges pending in great britain

president bush is winning praise from farmers 
and business groups by promising to allow the soviet union up to 
13 billion in loan guarantees to buy us farm products and 
manufactured goods 
citing tough times difficult times facing the soviet 
people bush announced wednesday he was waiving through june 1991 
longstanding trade restrictions that blocked the us government 
from extending credit guarantees to the soviet union 
farm and business groups had lobbied hard for the credit 
guarantees arguing that without them the united states risked 
being shut out of the huge soviet market 
the presidents action will make up to 1 billion in credit 
guarantees available to support the purchase of wheat corn and 
other farm products and extend up to 300 million in government 
guarantees for purchase of us manufactured products 
the guarantees dont mean the united states is extending direct 
aid to the soviets instead the us government will promise to 
repay loans put forward by commercial banks to finance the 
purchases if the soviets default on their obligations 
asked today if us taxpayers would be stuck with the bill if 
the soviets could not repay the loans commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher said i guess eventually thats what would happen 
but he said on nbcs today show we think its worth the 
gamble the soviet union has a remarkably good record over the 
years of paying all their debts and he said the american 
farmer will get some real benefits from this 
farm groups saw the 1 billion proposal as only a first step 
suggesting that up to 3 billion in farm guarantees should be 
considered given the need to unload bumper harvests on world 
markets 
this is a winwin situation said south dakota gov george 
mikelson both the people of the soviet union and the farmers of 
the united states have reason to celebrate 
howard lewis a vice president of the 15000member national 
association of manufacturers calleds bushs decision a first 
step to allow us companies to enter the soviet market on an equal 
basis with those of our trading competitors 
in his announcement wednesday bush outlined a varied economic 
aid package that included technical and medical assistance and 
support for the soviets to affiliate with the international 
monetary fund and world bank as special associates which would 
qualify the soviets to get economic advice in reforming their 
economy but not direct loans 
but the key action taken by the president wednesday was the 
waiver of the jacksonvanik amendment a 1974 law that was imposed 
to penalize the soviet union for restricting the right of jews and 
other minority groups to leave the country 
a presidential waiver of jacksonvanik was necessary for the 
soviets to qualify for the us credit guarantees 
for the past year bush had been insisting that he would not 
waive jacksonvanik until the soviet legislature put into law the 
countrys liberalized emigration policies 
the law has not passed but the administration decided to heed 
the threat of critical food shortages this winter in the soviet 
union the change of heart also reflected a desire to reward 
gorbachev for his support of americas effort to force iraq to 
leave kuwait 
a waiver of the jacksonvanik amendment also is necessary to 
clear the way for the soviets to obtain preferential tariffs on 
soviet products such as vodka and caviar that are sold in the 
united states soviet products now face duties that are up to 10 
times as high as the tariffs imposed on other countries 
while the lower tariffs would normalize trade relations between 
the two nations for the first time in nearly a halfcentury bush 
said he was withholding this economic prize until the emigration 
law was passed 
the administration said the trade agreement bush signed with 
gorbachev in june granting the soviets most favored nation 
trading status would not be forwarded to congress for approval 
until the emigration legislation is passed 
the credit guarantees will be offered by the commodity credit 
corp which supports us farm purchases and the export import 
bank which provides guarantees to back purchases of manufactured 
goods 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said that based on 
expected demand the soviet guarantees of up to 1 billion could be 
extended without reducing support for any other country 
among the us businesses that have expressed interest in 
obtaining credit guarantees are companies such as upjohn which 
hopes to build pharmaceutical plants in the soviet union and 
international business machines which is seeking to sell thousands 
of personal computers to the soviets

more than 400 us and canadian roman catholic 
theologians have accused the vatican of stifling churh reforms 
inhibiting freedom of expression and wrongly restricting the role 
of women 
the theologians in a statement released wednesday also accused 
the vatican of attempting to diminish the role of its bishops and 
churches in favor of more centralized control attacking the rights 
of theologians who criticize the church and hampering the drive for 
christian unity 
the role of the local churches of their bishops and of the 
bishops conferences is being diminished the theologians 
declared in the 2400word statement 
it was distributed to the catholic theological society of 
americas 1400 us and canadian members of the 544 who returned 
it 431 or 79 percent endorsed it 
the document issued on the 25th anniversary of the second 
vatican council of 196265 accused the churchs leadership of 
failing to carry out reforms called for by vatican ii 
instead the theologians said the vatican has treated 
theologians public disagreement with church positions as defiance 
and attempted to restrict their freedom of expression through 
loyalty oaths and professions of faith 
the statement titled do not extinguish the spirit was 
drawn up by a committee headed by the rev john boyle of the 
university of iowa it took its name from an admonition by st 
paul the new testament missionaryapostle 
development of legitimate public roles for women in the church 
is being neglected the theologians said adding that this is 
pointed up by its contrast with the increasing prominence of women 
in most fields 
rather than being viewed as a sign of the times feminism is 
consistently viewed with suspicion they said adding that 
candidates for bishop are screened to insure their unqualified 
opposition to the ordination of women 
concerning efforts for christian unity hopes that were so 
high in the years following the council have been disappointed 
and the vigor of catholic commitment to it seems diminished 
the theologians said 
an authoritarian style of acting and inappropriate 
interventions that do not respect the distinctive traditions of 
churches rekindle fears among orthodox anglicans and 
protestants that acceptance of the papacy would mean the 
destruction of the distinctive traditions of their churches the 
theologians statement said

retail sales fell 01 percent in november the 
first decline in six months the government said today in a report 
containing more evidence of a notsojolly christmas shopping 
season 
even before the commerce departments report major retailers 
had said their sales were off from a year earlier analysts 
attribute the slow sales to fewer jobs and less income and anxiety 
over the persian gulf crisis 
the department said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted 1516 
billion down from 1518 billion in october and the first decline 
since a similar 01 percent drop in may however the revised 02 
percent gain in october was a bit stronger than the 01 percent 
advance originally reported 
automobile sales plummeted 13 percent reversing a steep 14 
percent increase in october but some analysts said much of the 
october activity came from fleet sales excluding the automobile 
category sales inched up 02 percent 
the thanksgiving weekend traditionally is the beginning of the 
holiday shopping season that often sets the tone for the remainder 
of the period because of slack sales many retailers have resorted 
to markdowns and other incentives to lure shoppers 
nevertheless department store sales fell 04 percent in 
november following a 06 percent decline a month earlier

supporters of a government overhaul designed to 
help minorities get elected to city council have asked a federal 
judge to order dallas to hold an election under the new setup 
plaintiffs marvin crenshaw and roy williams filed a motion 
wednesday asking us district judge jerry buchmeyer to schedule 
the election using a districting scheme 
the city has 20 days to respond to the motion 
on saturday voters rejected by 369 votes a measure under which 
14 council members would would be elected from districts and the 
mayor would be elected from the city as a whole the vote was 
45255 in favor and 45624 against 
under the current system instituted in 1975 eight members are 
elected from districts and three others including the mayor are 
elected from the city at large 
though the plan was defeated us district judged jerry 
buchmeyer could institute the same plan or a similar one and call a 
city council election in may the judge indicated he could rule as 
early as january 
supporters said the plan would have helped ease racial 
inequities that make it difficult for minorities to get elected 
opponents said the system would have resegregated dallas 
the city council will meet next week to consider hiring outside 
lawyers to handle the case 
buchmeyer last march invalidated dallas current system he said 
it dilutes the voting strength of minorities who hold two of the 
11 council seats 
crenshaw and williams said saturdays referendum was the citys 
idea and that now they are simply pursuing their suit to improve 
minorities political representation 
this is about equal representation williams said were 
using constitutional law to defend our position and put into place 
a fair and equitable system of government 
the majority of nonminority voters who defeated the 141 setup 
should not be allowed to suppress the rights of minority residents 
crenshaw said

federal investigators say they will look 
into whether a paper mill contributed to the heavy fog blamed for a 
fiery highway pileup that killed 13 people and injured more than 
50 
authorities said tuesdays chainreaction wreck apparently 
started when a truck on interstate 75 slowed because of the fog and 
was rearended by another that crash caused wrecks on both sides 
of the highway involving 83 vehicles 
more than a dozen vehicles caught fire as fuel tanks ruptured 
and a load of organic peroxide carried by a tractortrailor rig 
ignited 
six people remained hospitalized in critical condition 
wednesday 
the stretch of highway is notorious for deadly pockets of fog 
this was a most unusual fog said robert barlett head of a 
national transportation safety board team investigating the crash 
it was very intense and very difficult to see through our 
investigators said this was one of the worst they had ever seen 
ntsb vice chairman susan coughlin said investigators would look 
into whether steam from the bowater southern industries mill near 
the highway contributed to the fog but she emphasized it was too 
early to speculate on the cause of the accident 
bowater spokeswoman astrid sheil said mill officials believe 
natural weather conditions caused tuesdays fog the weather 
conditions with the inversion from the hot air during the day time 
and the cold ground trapped the fog in she said 
a chainreaction crash in the same area in 1978 involved 61 
vehicles and injured 46 people three people were killed and 14 
injured in a 1979 accident involving 18 vehicles 
a study conducted after the 1978 accident concluded that the 
bowater plant appeared to be the primary source of fog in the 
area 
barlett said th ntsb would review safety recommendations it 
made about the highway to the state in 1979 including increased 
patrols and a fogdetection and warning system the state put up 
fogwarning signs with flashing lights in 1980 but barlett said 
only the sign for southbound traffic was on tuesday morning 
wayne davis a civil engineer who directed the study for the 
university of tennessee said paper plants which release large 
amounts of steam routinely cause fog 
if you look around the nation you will always find the 
potential for dense fog around paper plants he said 
ms sheil said mill officials reject the studys findings 
authorities originally reported 15 people killed but lowered 
the figure to 13 on wednesday ntsb officials said the mangled 
condition of the bodies led to the incorrect figure by this 
morning four of the 13 victims had been identified

the federal office of thrift supervision has 
taken its first major enforcement action against auditors accused 
of failing to report lax savings and loan practices 
the ots announced wednesday that coopers amp lybrand one of the 
nations largest accounting firms has agreed to tighten its 
auditing procedures 
experts have said that accountants played an important role in 
the 500 billion savings and loan scandal but until now regulators 
have focused their attention mainly on sampl operators and directors 
the charges against coopers amp lybrand stemmed from its 1986 
audit of silverado banking savings and loan association of denver 
whose board of directors included president bushs son neil the 
collapse of silverado in december 1988 is expected to cost 
taxpayers 1 billion 
ots had accused coopers amp lybrand and arthur l knight who 
headed the firms team that handled the silverado audit of 
accepting an unjustified understatement of silverados 
allowance for loan losses on its 13 billion loan portfolio 
relying on appraisers judgments that were not justified by 
market conditions or by financial statements applying to the 
properties behind the loans 
not following accounting principles 
the loan loss allowance should have been 35 million higher ots 
said 
the auditors did not possess the expertise required to 
properly complete the silverado audit the office asserted in a 
legal brief released with its announcement 
this is a significant case for ots for those who provide 
professional services to insured institutions and for the public 
said timothy ryan director of the office in a written statement 
it says loud and clear that we hold accountants lawyers and 
other professionals accountable for their actions just as we do 
sampl directors and officers 
in its settlement the accounting firm agreed to meet a number 
of auditing requirements over the next five years in addition 
knight agreed not to audit any insured savings institutions 
in todays emotional and supercharged environment coopers amp 
lybrand decided as a prudent business matter not to incur the 
expense aggravation and substantial publicity that would have been 
associated with fighting the office of thrift supervision the 
firms general counsel harris j amhowitz said in a statement 
amhowitzs statement indicated that coopers amp lybrand believed 
its silverado audit was not faulty 
during the relevant 198687 period the firm conducted several 
hundred audits of savings institutions with no indication of any 
endemic audit failures the statement said the general 
accounting offices report to congress regarding audits by various 
accounting firms of failed savings associations expressed no 
criticism of coopers amp lybrands audits 
coopers amp lybrand agreed among other things to ensure that 
employees on sampl audits are competent and to comply with 
accounting principles for those audits 
if coopers amp lybrand had not settled the charges it could have 
been required to participate in a public administrative hearing 
in a separate action ots has charged neil bush with conflict of 
interest in not fully disclosing his business ties with two big 
silverado borrowers the thrift agency is seeking an administrative 
order against bush an oil and gas developer that could lead to 
barring him from the banking and savings industries 
bush 35 has denied any wrongdoing administrative law judge 
daniel j davidson is expected to recommend by jan 2 what 
sanctions if any should be taken against bush 
the presidents son and other former silverado directors as 
well as the thrifts law firm have been charged with negligence in 
a 200 million lawsuit filed in september by the federal deposit 
insurance corp

north korea sharply criticized south 
korea for failing to sign a nonaggression pact at highlevel talks 
today and claimed the seoul government had improperly arrested 
dissidents 
south korea is making fun of the highlevel talks said an 
byong su spokesman for the north korean delegation after todays 
final session of the twoday meeting between the two countries 
prime ministers 
he also charged south korea with making a hostile and 
provocative act against the north by arresting three dissidents 
for unauthorized contacts with north koreans in berlin at the end 
of november 
todays talks the third round since september are the 
highestlevel meetings between the two koreas since the peninsula 
was divided in 1945 and the border tightly sealed the north korean 
delegation returns home friday 
the meeting between north korean premier yon hyong muk and his 
south korean counterpart kang younghoon was held in a tense 
atmosphere created in part by the televised departure of south 
korean president roh taewoo for a fourday state visit to the 
soviet union 
the soviet union is an ally of the communist north which has 
denounced the trip the first since moscow established relations 
with seoul two months ago 
the two premiers failed to sign any agreements during the 
twoday meeting but officials said they tenatively planned to meet 
again on feb 25 through feb 28 in north koreas capital 
pyongyang 
signing a pledge of nonaggression has been the focus of the 
talks 
north korea and south korea fought a threeyear war in the early 
1950s and the border between them is the most heavily fortified 
permanent demarcation in the world 
although both sides have proposed nonaggression pacts south 
korea has insisted any agreement be part of a broader accord 
including exchanges and cooperation to build mutual trust 
south korea was indecisive and waywardsaid an the north 
korean spokesman the nonaggression statement is not a useless 
piece of paper 
north korea has repeatedly demanded the release of all south 
korean dissidents jailed for contacting north koreans in defiance 
of south korean law south korea has accused the north of meddling 
in domestic politics 
we feel sorry the meeting ended without any good results 
said limb dongwon a delegate and south koreas spokesman he said 
there were sharp discussions on the issues 
if another round of talks is held in february it will be near 
the time of the annual ussouth korean military exercises which 
the north has demanded be halted north korea has suggested it 
might boycott future talks if the exercises take place south korea 
has indicated it will scale back the exercise if the talks show 
progress 
in a departure statement today roh said his visit to the soviet 
union signaled the confontation between the two koreas was coming 
to an end 
the very fact that i am the first president of the republic of 
korea to visit the soviet union signifies that the cold war is 
fading away on the korean peninsula roh said 
roh will hold two rounds of talks with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev and visit leningrad before returning home on monday

the soviet union appears to have softened its 
demand that israel accept an international peace conference with 
the arabs 
but the kremlin is still balking at resuming full diplomatic 
relations with the jewish state which it severed 23 years ago in a 
show of solidarity with israels arab neighbors 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir discussed their relationship at a 
previously unscheduled meeting wednesday most of the session was 
devoted to discussion of the persian gulf crisis and the settlement 
of the arabisraeli dispute shevardnadze said 
shamir met secretary of state james baker today and described 
israels assessment of the iraqi threat to israel and to the 
region he urged that the united states keep in mind these concerns 
when making decisions about resolving the gulf crisis 
baker told him the administration understands well our 
concerns and has them clearly in mind said an israeli diplomat 
the soviets who asked for the meeting with shamir have been 
eager to carve a bigger role in mideast diplomacy which has 
traditionally been conducted under us auspices 
i think it was a very necessary and useful talk 
shevardnadze told reporters at a brief news conference with shamir 
shamir said he told shevardnadze of israels desire for 
resumption of diplomatic ties as soon as possible 
shevardnadze indicated that he was no longer insisting israel 
must agree to participate in a mideast peace conference before 
diplomatic ties could be renewed 
no were not setting any preconditions he said in response 
to a question at a brief news conference with shamir at his side 
we are moving toward full ties shevardnadze said the 
process is developing in normal fashion with the renewal of 
consular ties recently and the flourishing of economic and cultural 
programs 
the two leaders appeared to have set aside their differences 
over an international peace conference let us not talk about a 
conference now shevardnadze said laughingly eliciting a chuckle 
from shamir 
shamir and shevardnadze appeared to agree that priority must now 
be given to removing iraq from kuwait the same approach the 
israeli leader agreed on with president bush at their meeting 
tuesday bush and shamir said stalled arabisraeli peace talks 
would have to wait until the gulf crisis was resolved 
the soviets have joined the united states is seeking to scuttle 
a proposed united nations security council resolution by some arab 
states and their allies that would call for an international 
mideast conference to resolve the arabisraeli conflict 
moscow decided to support the united states because it doesnt 
want to placate iraqi attempts to link its pullout from kuwait to 
israeli withdrawal from the lands it captured in the 1967 mideast 
war 
the soviet minister said he and shamir discussed the need for 
peace talks between israel and the arabs whether bilateral or 
multilateral well consult about that he said 
shamir agreed thanking shevardnadze for his sincere desire 
to solve the arabisraeli dispute 
earlier shamir had ruled out an international peace conference 
israel will not participate in such a conference and israel 
will not accept imposed solutions he told an american enterprise 
institute conference before meeting with shevardnadze 
instead israel wants direct talks with its arab neighbors as 
outlined in a fourpoint peace plan shamir proposed last year 
but usbacked efforts to implement the plan broke down earlier 
this year in disagreement over one of its major elements 
elections among the 17 million palestinians in the 
israelioccupied territories 
shamir made clear israel hadnt changed its mind about excluding 
the palestine liberation organization from the elections and said 
he hoped the plos support for iraq had convinced the world it 
wasnt a suitable peace partner 
shevardnadze thanked shamir for his endorsement of bushs 
decision to temporarily waive the 1974 jacksonvanik amendment 
limiting trade with the soviets unless they allow free emigration 
bush announced his decision to shevardnadze at the white house 
earlier wednesday 
israel and its supporters in congress had spearheaded opposition 
for 15 years to trade concessions because of the soviets human 
rights abuses 
but over the past year soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
has allowed 150000 jews to leave for israel 
shamir said he renewed israeli demands that the kremlin allow 
direct airline flights to israel shevardnadze said he hoped such 
flights could be arranged soon shamir said

a woman fighting in court to have her 
child treated with traditional chinese medicine rather than surgery 
has won a round but the state retains custody of the little girl 
juliet cheng a chinese immigrant has been fighting the state 
department of children and youth services for five months over 
treatment for her 7yearold daughter shirley who has rheumatoid 
arthritis 
the state wanted doctors to operate on shirleys joints which 
are swollen and partly immobile 
cheng wanted shirley treated with acupuncture herbal medicines 
and massage 
on tuesday two of three doctors approved by a federal judge to 
examine the girl recommended against surgery chengs attorney 
george athanson said he thinks their recommendation would 
invalidate a juvenile court order authorizing surgery 
for now shirley remains at newington childrens hospital and 
the department of children and youth services will retain custody 
until the issue is resolved in juvenile court after the state 
submits final recommendations on treatment and custody dcys 
spokesman thomas moriarty said wednesday 
moriarty would not say if the state has decided to give up its 
attempts to force surgery but said officials will use the 
recommendations of the courtsanction panel of doctors as the basis 
for its report to the court 
state attorney general clarine nardi riddle also said wednesday 
that her office has not made a decision on whether to seek to 
retain custody or seek a new order for surgery 
shirley has been at newington since july when the state took 
temporary custody after cheng refused to allow surgery 
cheng won a reprieve in october when us district judge t 
emmet clarie approved an agreement allowing her to use the 
treatment of her choice for two months 
because she was unable to find a chinese practitioner who also 
was a medical doctor as required by the court cheng chose dr 
william shevin a homeopathic physician from woodstock 
shevin has used physical therapy and small doses of natural 
medicines including poison ivy and phosphorous which he says has 
reduced severe swelling in shirleys joints 
cheng said she just wants her daughter home 
i havent missed a day in five months visiting her at the 
hospital and i want her to come home cheng said

other state of emergency restrictions on a small separatist enclave 
where violence broke out after georgia abolished the enclaves 
autonomy it was reported today 
the clampdown in south ossetia on wednesday night followed three 
fatal shootings in the capital of tskhinvali earlier in the day

the georgian supreme soviet on tuesday ended 68 years of 
autonomy in south ossetia which last week elected a legislature 
and declared sovereignty ethnic georgians living in the region 
boycotted the vote according to interfax

autonomous republics in the soviet union with limited jurisdiction 
over their affairs having delegated many functions to their host 
republic

an apprentice engineer was at the controls and 
reportedly speeding when his amtrak train jumped the tracks in a 
station and slammed into a rushhour commuter train injuring 264 
people authorities said 
published reports today disputed by amtrak said the train was 
traveling at least twice the 30 mph limit in back bay station when 
it crashed wednesday morning 
in washington amtrak spokesman patrick jeffery said the trains 
speed had yet to be determined 
there were some witnesses who felt the train was going very 
fast we dont base our information on that he said in a 
telephone interview a diagram of the crash did not suggest high 
speeds were involved he said 
jeffery confirmed a published report that the apprentice 
engineer had begun operating the washingtonboston line on a 
regular basis only on monday but he said the apprentice had been 
operating trains under supervision since 1987 and had been tested 
on his familiarity on that line 
amtrak denied inexperience caused the crash because the 
apprentice was supervised by an experienced engineer 
he wasnt doing it alone we dont consider that was a factor 
at this point but we really dont know jeffery said 
amtraks night owl from washington traveled nearly a 
quartermile after derailing then struck the rear of the 
massachusetts bay transportation authority train said thomas 
glynn mbta general manager 
the impact was so violent that amtrak cars hit the tunnels 
ceiling and buckled the road above 
glynn said 264 people were injured 10 critically the commuter 
train had its usual load of about 900 passengers and the amtrak 
train had about 190 he said 
all the lights went out people started screaming the place 
was filled with smoke a few people were trapped under seats 
said commuter chris good 
most of the injured suffered cuts bruises broken bones and 
smoke inhalation from a fire caused when 1500 gallons of spilled 
diesel ignited 
back bay station will be closed until at least monday while the 
wreckage is cleared and thousands of commuters are taking buses 
into downtown boston 
commuting is fine this morning everything is working fine 
transit authority spokesman bob devin said today he said mbta 
personnel were stationed around the system to direct commuters 
whose routes were changed 
the apprentice richard abramson 41 of trumbull conn had 
three years training on how to operate a locomotive and was 
authorized to run a train under a senior engineers supervision 
said dave beatty amtrak general supervisor abramson was 
hospitalized in stable condition with a broken collar bone an 
injured back and facial injuries 
he was qualified to do the job amtrak spokesman howard 
robertson said he was qualified in the rules in the opeation 
of the engine in the route and the rails he had proper training 
and we dont think it inexperience had anything to do with the 
crash 
abramson was operating the train under the supervision of 
25year veteran engineer willis copeland beatty said copeland 
53 of bethany conn was critically injured 
copeland was the engineer on one of the trains in a headon 
collision in new york city in 1984 in which one person was killed 
and 115 were injured said amtrak spokeswoman marci larson but 
copeland was completely exonerated larson said 
the boston globe citing sources it didnt identify said 
abramson had started operating trains on regular amtrak routes only 
two days before the crash the globe said abramson had worked for 
amtrak since 1973 first as a clerk then a yard engineer 
the globe and the boston herald quoted unidentified sources as 
saying the night owl was traveling at least twice back bay 
stations speed limit when it crashed the train had been scheduled 
to stop at the station before heading to its last stop at south 
station in downtown boston 
well be looking at preexisting damage on the tracks same 
thing on the wheels of the train said ted lopatkiewicz a member 
of a national transportation safety board team dispatched to the 
scene well look at human performance what the crew did their 
background 
a similar crash occurred at the station between an amtrak train 
and a commuter train in 1987 the ntsb determined that crash which 
caused far less damage was caused by an improperly designed signal 
system with human error a secondary factor 
well be very interested in seeing if there are any 
connections said ntsb spokesman brent bahler 
the federal railroad administration also sent inspectors and 
subjected the train crews to alcohol and drug tests mandatory 
after serious rail accidents 
the two amtrak locomotives and a baggage car were destroyed in 
the collision fire lt mike walsh one of the first on the scene 
said the massive locomotives were twisted like a coat hanger 
firefighters emerging from the tunnel said most passengers did 
not panic there was an eerie calm walsh said 
some firemen handed oxygen masks to victims most of the 
passengers were able to walk out of the station but a number were 
carried out on stretchers at least nine had to be extracted from 
the wreckage walsh said 
passengers emerging from the train described being thrown to the 
floor bruising their faces and necks they said the lights in the 
trains went out leaving them groping through a dense smoke that 
passenger joe povoas said you could grind with your teeth you 
could spit it out

japans parliament today approved 1 billion to 
help support the usled multinational force deployed against iraq 
the final portion of 2 billion already pledged to the force by 
tokyo 
the vote in the lower house of the diet or parliament came two 
days after a pentagon spokesman accused japan of being slow to send 
the funds the oppositioncontrolled upper house is expected to 
vote against the bill but japans constitution allows lower house 
decisions to prevail on budget matters 
in all japan has pledged 4 billion in aid resulting from the 
persian gulf crisis 2 billion for the multinational forces and 
2 billion for nations suffering from the international trade 
embargo against iraq 
japanese officials denied on wednesday that japan was dragging 
its feet in disbursing the funds 
on tuesday us defense department spokesman pete williams said 
japan and germany two of the worlds leading economic powers had 
delivered barely onefifth of the money and materials they promised 
for allied military operations in the gulf 
japanese officials said of the 2 billion pledged for the 
military forces about 900 million had been allocated as a gulf 
peace fund and more than half of that had been contracted or spent 
another 100 million had been spent or contracted for transport and 
medical aid they added on condition of anonymity 
the remaining 1 billion was approved today 
the officials blamed delays on disbursement of 600 million in 
emergency commodity loans to egypt jordan and turkey on red tape 
in the recipient countries 
the disbursement of another 400 million for frontline states 
has been pledged they said 
japan which imports nearly all of its oil has not sent troops 
to the gulf it cited its postwar constitution drafted under us 
occupation that banned the use of military force to settle 
international disputes 
the governing liberal democratic party also proposed sending 
troops for noncombat roles with the gulf forces but abandoned the 
plan after encountering strong opposition the government now is 
considering a new bill to allow sending nonmilitary personnel for 
service with peacekeeping missions 
us sources said monday that operation desert shield the us 
military response to iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait may cost 30 
billion in 1991 the pentagons original cost estimate was 15 
billion but that was before president bush ordered huge 
reinforcements to the gulf on nov 8

critically serious budget problems will 
dominate the agendas of legislatures across the country in 1991 
say state lawmakers who will struggle amid slumping economic 
conditions 
twothirds of states expect major difficulty in balancing their 
budgets legislative leaders reported in a survey conducted this 
month by the national conference of state legislatures 
states facing the most acute financial troubles include 
california florida new york pennsylvania and texas the 
lawmakers reported 
the budget crunch at the state level is as serious as it was 
in 1982 when the country was coming out of a recession maine 
house speaker john martin president of the group said at a news 
conference today 
potentially it could get worse martin said 
the worsening conditions seem to be progressing at a faster 
rate than in the early 80s he said 
state economies are slowing revenues and reserves are falling 
and unemployment is rising the state legislators said major state 
expenditures continue to grow especially for medicaid corrections 
and education the leaders reported 
adding to the states woes are federally mandated changes in 
programs such as medicaid with the states paying the bill for the 
revisions 
original revenue estimates for 1991 are being lowered in about 
half the states in the country the legislative leaders said in the 
survey 
it will be about a year and a half before state finances 
stabilize said martin a democrat serving as president this year 
of the national conference of state legislatures 
other toppriority issues in state legislatures next year will 
be tax reform education and the environment according to the 
survey 
taxes will be seen in some cases as partial antidotes to state 
financial woes 
new hampshire will consider broadening the base of its business 
profits tax and louisiana will decide whether to continue the 
suspension of certain sales tax exemptions the legislative leaders 
reported tennessee will consider alternatives including a 
personal income tax to finance an education reform package 
property tax reform also will be a major issue in some states 
wisconsin may reduce dependence on local property taxes for 
education relying instead on using lottery proceeds according to 
the study 
in the survey legislative leaders reported that 
california faces a revenue shortfall that may reach 1 billion 
in fiscal 1991 with a shortfall of up to 59 billion the 
following year 
new york and florida face mounting budget shortfalls despite 
substantial tax increases last year 
texas faces a shortfall too even though higher energy prices 
are a boost to the state economy 
pennsylvania faces a 15 billion shortfall and the governor 
there opposes tax increases and recommends cuts in spending to 
solve the problem

at least 40 rebels are believed to have been killed in the 
operation which lasted over four hours said the officials who

no immediate response from the liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
which has been fighting for an independent nation in the northern 
and eastern regions since 1983

from military intelligence 
this is the second major air offensive against tiger rebels 
since they overran an important military camp last month in the 
northern region of mankulam killing at least 100 soldiers

innocent tamils and attack forces said wijeratne but we have 
been tipped off and are taking appropriate action 
the government routinely describes tamil militants as 
terrorists 
wijeratne said 18 suspected rebels were arrested from the 
karaitivu camp 
more than 14000 people have been killed in the 7yearold 
separatist campaign

angolan rebel leader jonas savimbi said today 
after a meeting with president bush that peace prospects for his 
country have improved as a result of a joint efforts by the united 
states and the soviet union 
i think both the united states and the soviet union are 
joining hands in trying to find a solution to the angolan 
problem savimbi said after a 20minute meeting with bush during 
which he thanked the president for us support for his forces 
he said his goal is a truce in early 1991 and free and fair 
elections by the end of the year he said the rival factions in 
angola are close to a settlement 
the anticommunist rebel leader met with bush after an 
unprecedented meeting on wednesday with soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze after the white house meeting a fiveparty 
discussion was held to work on what savimbi described as the 
parameters of a peace settlement 
us soviet and portuguese officials were involved along with 
representatives of angolas two warring factions portugal has been 
playing a mediating role in peace negotiations involving its former 
african colony 
a state department official insisting on anonymity said the 
shevardnadze meeting with savimbi was of immense importance 
given the 15 years of unswerving support moscow has given to 
angolas mpla government 
it demonstrated that the soviet union wants to become fully 
engaged in the peace process in angola the official said adding 
that it also sends a strong signal to the angolan government 
it was just a year ago that washington and moscow cooperated in 
bringing about an end to the civil war in nicaragua by supporting a 
process that included free and fair elections 
after his 45minute meeting with shevardnadze at the soviet 
embassy savimbi indicated the soviets seem interested in applying 
the same formula to angola 
the foreign minister has assured us of their desire to help 
the angolans achieve peace stability and democracy savimbi 
said the most important thing is that all the big powers 
understand they can cooperate to find peace and stability of our 
country 
shevardnadze said that if the mpla government and the unita 
rebels are able to reach a ceasefire agreement then it would be 
easier for us to address the possibility of a cutoff of arms 
the soviets have been a generous arms supplier to the government 
since the leftist mpla took power in 1975 after portugal ended 
centuries of colonial rule in angola 
among the prerequisites for a settlement according to unita 
are assurances that its representatives will be able to participate 
freely and fairly i a political process that will culminate in 
internationally supervised elections 
as savimbi met with shevardnadze secretary of state james a 
baker iii conferred with angolan foreign minister pedro de castro 
van dunem 
the state department said baker urged van dunem to persuade his 
government to make the necessary final compromises to reach a 
peaceful solution 
van dunem said afterward only that progress is being made toward 
an agreement that can lead to a ceasefire

william bennett today told president bush that 
he would not accept the chairmanship of the republican national 
committee citing financial reasons 
bennett who recently resigned as the nations drug policy 
director told president bush in a letter that taking the job would 
conflict with planned outside interests including a book contract 
therefore bennett told bush he was turning down the offer 
with the deepest reluctance the white house released a copy of 
the letter 
bennett was chosen for the top party post in november when 
president bush decided to replace ailing lee atwater who is 
undergoing treatment for a brain tumor 
bennett told reporters that lawyers including white house 
counsel boyden gray had indicated that ethics considerations 
involved in financial activities he wanted to conduct presented 
enough of a gray area for him to turn down the job 
the conflicts he said would preclude him from carrying out a 
simon and schuster book contract as well as consulting and 
speaking engagements he wanted to do 
i didnt take a vow of poverty bennett said 
he said he had spoken to several lawyers in addition to gray 
including his personal lawyer robert barnett and his brother 
robert bennett 
have now determined with the deepest reluctance that i 
cannot serve as both chairman of the republican national committee 
and fulfill these personal and other professional 
responsibilities bennett said in his letter 
among these is a longstanding contractural commitment to simon 
and schuster to write two books they have recently advised 
underestandably that they cannot extend my commitment to them for 
yet another two years he added 
traditionally the head of the party has been allowed to have 
outside income as has the head of the democratic national 
committee 
however the fact that bennett would go right from government 
service into the party position puts him under an ethics law that 
limits his outside activities for one year 
bennett himelf mentioned this telling bush i am now advised 
by legal counsel that federal ethics law could be interpreted to 
limit substantially my involvement in private sector activities 
while serving as rnc chairman during that first year 
i would not want this to create an apperance of impropriety 
bennett told bush 
he vowed to help the president in his reelection campaign and 
told bush nothing in federal ethics law prevents me from 
continuing to speak out on behalf of you and the policies of your 
administration 
bennetts decision came amid widespread dissatisfaction among 
party regulars with bushs choice bennett is a staunch 
conservative who had no political campaign experience and was seen 
by some as a poor choice to run the party machinery during the 1992 
election cycle 
bennett had made his first formal appearance as the designated 
party chairman on monday before the republican governors 
association conference in pinehurst nc there was no hint then 
that he was having second thoughts 
dont forget im not elected yet he told them the 
republican national committee meets jan 25 for what was to have 
been automatic approval of bushs choice

frances top terrorism investigator who was 
heavily criticized for freeing an iranian implicated in bombings 
that terrorized paris in 1986 died today after shooting himself in 
the mouth 
judge gilles boulouque 40 was eulogized by former prime 
minister jacques chirac as a man of great integrity who brought a 
very important contribution to the fight against terrorism 
boulouque died shortly after midnight of the selfinflicted 
gunshot wound police said the state prosecutor immediately 
ordered an autopsy 
police sources said they found a letter addressed to boulouques 
wife concerning his intended suicide the sources said without 
elaborating that the letter indicated his motives were personal 
investigators said earlier they had no doubt boulouques death at 
his montmartre home was a suicide 
boulouque made his reputation investigating the series of deadly 
paris bombings in 1986 he gained notoriety as the man who let an 
iranian embassy employee at the center of the investigation fly 
home in november 1987 
boulouques decision to free iranian embassy translator wahid 
gordji at the height of the investigation put him at the center of 
a politicallegal controversy and led to public derision 
for months boulouque had tried to interview gordji considered 
irans no 2 man in france but gordji locked up inside his 
mission refused to come out the decision to allow him to return 
to iran was a major step in reestablishing frenchiranian 
diplomatic ties 
a tunisian fouad ali saleh was eventually convicted of heading 
the terrorist ring responsible for the paris bombings during 
boulouques investigation saleh accused the investigator of 
violating secrecy laws regarding the probe the accusation never 
resulted in a trial 
boulouque had worked under tight security since 1986 riding in 
an armored car surrounded by bodyguards and carrying his own 
pistol officials said he received numerous death threats 
according to his collegues 
boulouques lawyer francois sarda denied reports the suicide 
was prompted by family problems the french press claimed he had an 
argument with his wife while attending an art opening hours before 
his death 
in a statement sarda said boulouque was the victim of unjust 
accusations boulouque lived with a silent revolt inside him that 
undoubtedly wore on his nerves the lawyer said 
boulouque also was the investigating judge in the case of 
convicted lebanese terrorist georges ibrahim abdallah who is 
serving a life term for killing an american military attache in 
paris 
boulouque recently took on the investigation of a french arm of 
the basque terrorist group eta

the government has decided to return 
church property that was confiscated by communists starting in 
1948 the state news agency mti reported thursday 
the draft bill to return schools hospitals and cultural 
establishments will be presented to parliament for final approval 
in the near future 
large estates formerly owned by the churches are expressly not 
included in the plan mti said 
implementation of the decision will be spread over a 10year 
period 
churches have made applications for the return of about 800 
facilities throughout the country said laszlo szalay of the 
ministry of education and culture he was quoted by the daily mai 
nap 
eventually tens of thousands of institutions might be affected 
he said 
most hungarians are roman catholic but there are lutherans and 
calvinists as well 
pope john paul ii is scheduled to visit hungary next summer 
hungary like other countries in what used to be the east bloc 
threw out its communist leaders and elected a centerright 
government in the spring 
its decision to open its border with austria last year 
encouraged a wave of east germans to flee their country through 
hungary and some people believe that was the catalyst for the 
eastern european revolutions

iraqi president saddam hussein said today 
his nation wants peace but that it will gladly wage war rather than 
permit foreign domination of arab oil or land the official iraqi 
news agency reported 
we want peace endeavor to achieve it and work to reach a 
point where no one of us brandishes his sword against the other 
but if the enemies want to push affairs to a military duel then by 
gods help we would win and would walk over their corpses and tread 
on their heads ina quoted saddam as saying 
the agency monitored in nicosia said saddam told his cabinet 
that iraqs enemies do not want it to remain an economic military 
or political power because they believe it is a danger they should 
not permit in the region 
the battle against us did not start in august the 
conspiracy began long before that date because of our panarab 
stand our position on palestine and our demand that it be returned 
to its people ina quoted him as saying 
referring to the usled multinational forces in saudi arabia 
saddam said if god wanted us to have the honor of waging this 
battle then let it be so that all this rot in the arab homeland 
would be removed 
in an effort to divide the antiiraq coaliton which includes 
egypt saudi arabia and syria saddam has repeatedly tried to link 
the gulf crisis with the palestinians fight for a homeland in 
territories occupied by israel 
the bush administration has suggested that if the multinational 
forces move to liberate kuwait they may also destroy iraqs 
stockpiles of chemical weapons and facilities that may one day give 
it the ability to build nuclear weapons

its the winter rice harvest and the 
talk in the paddy fields and marketplaces is about the crop and 
like everywhere else in bangladesh politics 
farmers rake rice grains with their feet across a cement slab to 
dry in the warm sun the monsoon rainfall was less than usual this 
summer but at least there was no drought flood cyclone tidal 
wave or serious tornado 
the mood is buoyant for another reason too when president 
hussain muhammad ershad resigned on dec 6 villagers marched 
through the marketplace in celebration it brought to a close 
ershads rigidly authoritarian eightyear rule 
we are happy hes gone maybe now democracy will come said 
kazi azimullah a student who had come home to work on his fathers 
farm 
but down the road in a place called ershad village the factory 
workers and rickshaw pullers felt no joy at the downfall of their 
patron 
ershadnagar as it is called in bengali is a complex of brick 
houses with tin roofs outdoor plumbing and no electricity the 
average daily wage is 135 but the people here say they have much 
to be grateful for as poor as it is its a vast improvement from 
their native hamlets 
ershad has been good for us if another government comes along 
and builds threestory buildings we would support it said 
shopkeeper mohammad malik but were worried the building may 
stop ershadnagar with 1000 permanent homes and 20000 people 
is only onethird built 
ershad a former general who seized power in 1982 bowed to a 
persistent sevenweek campaign of often violent street 
demonstrations the peoples uprising led by university students 
demanded that he quit and hand over power to a caretaker government 
which would prepare for free elections 
opposition parties accused him of fraud in each of the three 
elections held during his rule they also alleged that he or his 
wife salted away millions of dollars from kickbacks on government 
contracts 
on wednesday ershad was arrested and confined to a house in 
dhakas diplomatic enclave the house vacated several months ago 
had been the residence of british high commissioners or 
ambassadors for six years ershad is expected to be tried by 
special tribunals on charges of corruption and abuse of power 
now bangladesh is groping for a new political order since 
independence from pakistan in 1971 it has been governed by 
strongmen or militaryinstalled leaders 
it has had nine presidents but has never had a transition of 
power through the ballot box its two strongest presidents sheik 
mujibar rahman and gen ziaur rahman were assassinated 
bangladesh boasts a tradition of elections but not of democracy 
the 1986 parliamentary election in kuniya a village of 4000 
people 20 miles from dhaka was typical 
only 30 percent could vote when the others went to the 
polling station they saw that their votes had already been cast for 
them said azimullah the farmers son 
the country has a profusion of political parties which are 
roughly grouped into three major alliances the two dominant 
parties are divided by personal jealousies and historic rivalries 
more than by policies 
they are led by sheik hasina who inherited leadership of the 
awami league from her father and khaleda zia who took over her 
dead husbands bangladesh nationalist party the two women led the 
protest movement against ershad they are skilled in opposition 
politics and mustering street crowds but neither has experience in 
government 
they must establish a clean and honest administration and it 
must be done from the top said syed ishtiaq ahmed a supreme 
court attorney in dhaka 
but that wont be easy there is something that compels our 
political leaders toward authoritarianism and the potential for 
graft and corruption is difficult to resist he said 
the challenge for the next government is monumental desperately 
poor the people are regularly buffeted by natural disasters in a 
country which can barely feed itself during good years like this 
one 
bangladesh is everybodys basket case said a diplomat 
involved in aid projects here it has 110 million people crammed 
into a country the size of wisconsin with an average per capita 
income of 170 a year 
four out of five people live below the poverty line meaning 
they dont have enough to eat the literacy rate is officially 23 
percent but foreign diplomats believe the rate is much lower 
hasina the opposition leader says barely 15 percent of the people 
can write their own names 
half of the national budget or 16 billion a year comes from 
grants and loans by the world bank the asian development bank 
japan and smaller donors the us contribution is about 150 
million annually 
even before the gulf crisis jacked up oil prices and deprived 
bangladesh of one of its main sources of hard currency workers 
remittances the countrys foreign currency reserves had fallen to 
a bare 450 million just enough to cover six weeks imports 
despite the gloomy prospects there is a new hope in the 
country even among the professionals and businessmen who benefited 
from the loose controls and easy profits 
for the first time we are thinking about our collective 
virtues and not about our collective sins said azm 
enayetullah khan a publisher and former ambassador

university of alaska regent eric forrer 
decided the system was failing eskimo indian and aleut students 
and he wanted more from his fellow board members than just more 
money 
he wanted a promise that academia a pejorative word when 
forrer uses it would make more than an occasional field trip to 
rural villages he wanted a definition of classroom achievement 
that didnt always mean graduating with a fouryear degree 
at an august meeting forrer a selfemployed carpenter from 
juneau told the board about a collection of art done 20 years ago 
by his parents gradeschool students from the village of eek on 
the kuskokwim river in western alaska 
this art leads me to one of the first axioms of native 
education he told the board and that is that the standards 
and expectations for native students should reflect their abilities 
and these are precisely and exactly the abilities of everybody 
nationwide 
the regents unanimously approved forrers request for 274500 
for a fairbanksbased program aimed at easing promising high 
schoolers from rural alaska into university life 
the regents also rededicated the university to making native 
education one of its highest priorities the board asked for a 
consolidated budget for native programs and staff time dedicated to 
the issue 
the university has worked for decades setting up tutoring 
counseling and vocational programs so that rural students most of 
them member of alaskas three major native groups may make the 
most of their talents 
some of those programs like the rural alaska honors institute 
that forrer won extra funding for are reporting some success 
according to university figures threefourths of students who 
attended the institute continued their education after high school 
three rural campuses linked to the university of alaska 
fairbanks specialize in offering rural students certificate 
programs with a twoyear degree 
and at the university of alaska anchorage campus natives are 
expected to soon make up a slight majority of students enrolled in 
the fouryear school of nursing 
but in the meantime campus activists like 36yearold mary f 
reeve say attracting more native students isnt the answer when 
university figures show the native dropout rate is high 
recruitment is inappropriate until we can better serve the 
students we currently have said reeve 
reeve a yupik eskimo from the southwest alaska village of 
dillingham is a university of alaska anchorage student appointed 
to the board of regents in october 
she says the needs of native students are losing out as the 
university lives within a tighter state budget 
native student enrollment at the anchorage campus increased 
17 percent during the fall semester yet services to these 
students have been diminished reeve said 
among losses are layoffs of native workstudy students and no 
addition to the oneperson native guidance counselor staff she 
said 
at the kuskokwim campus in bethel director lamont e albertson 
says hes having good results with a threeweek initiation program 
that helps students 90 percent of them yupik eskimo make 
friends fast and get to know their teachers as people 
they learn we all have the same concerns in life that were 
not a caucasian god with all the answers anderson said 
still albertson says students who complete a twoyear degree 
at the campus are barred from going anywhere other than 
uafairbanks if they want more schooling 
our students have many more relatives in anchorage than in 
fairbanks if we already know that having those contacts close by 
helps rural students then we should get off our academic high 
horse and let them transfer directly to uaa or uaf no questions 
asked 
systemwide natives continue to account for just a fraction of 
all students attaining degrees 
in 1989 of 29963 degrees awarded at anchorage fairbanks and 
the university of alaska southeast combined 2414 went to natives 
that is considerable improvement though considering that 12 
years ago there were 175 graduates with fouryeardegrees from 
fairbanks just six of them alaska natives

riot police and members of an opposition 
political party clashed in a town southeast of mexico city leaving 
at least three people dead and 50 injured authorities said today 
the clash on wednesday followed four weeks of opposition 
protests that accused the longgoverning institutional 
revolutionary party of fraud in elections nov 11 in mexico state 
each side blamed the other for starting the disturbance in 
which two of the three killed were police 
i think this was planned by the state government to give us a 
violent image herberto castillo director of the leftleaning 
opposition revolutionary democratic party said in a telephone 
interview 
state gov ignacio pichardo pagaza said it is condemnable 
that the revolutionary democratic party tried to resolve its 
political differences in a useless manner 
at least 40 of the 50 injured people were police said cesar 
silva a spokesman for the state that rings mexico city the 
capital silva said four farm workers were being held on weapons 
charges 
the showdown took place when about 3000 people gathered in 
front of the city hall 75 miles southeast of mexico city to protest 
alleged fraud 
official results gave city hall to the governing party by a 
2to1 margin but the opposition rejected the results saying 
tejupilco always has favored the revolutionary democrats 
opposition rightists and leftists have often accused the 
governing party of resorting to fraud to maintain its 61yearold 
old on power 
opposition members had demonstrated outside city hall since nov 
14 to protest the results they gathered on wednesday to listen to 
castillo 
just when i began to speak the police attacked the women 
castillo said accusing the police of using guns and tear gas 
a state communique said the police only acted when the 
demonstrators tried to take over the city hall by force members 
of the prd fired powerful weapons at the front of the public 
building the statement said 
castillo denied the opposition party tried to take over the 
building photos published today in the capital showed many of the 
peasants with guns 
there were conflicting reports as to whether the police had 
guns

after three months without adequate food or water in the 
besieged us embassy in kuwait ambassador nathaniel howell and 
his staff left baghdad for home today on a chartered flight that 
reportedly carried 25 other americans 
officials said the last five us diplomats from kuwait were 
among 94 passengers on an iraqi airways flight to frankfurt 
germany it was said to be the last charter plane carrying 
foreigners from iraq and occupied kuwait 
howell barbara bodine the deputy chief of mission in kuwait 
and three other american diplomats earlier landed in baghdad aboard 
a uschartered iraqi airways plane from kuwait they were whisked 
through the departure lounge at baghdads saddam international 
airport and were not available for comment 
they are in good spirits and good shape and ready to get back 
to the states a us embassy official in baghdad said in on 
condition of anonymity 
he said the compound in kuwait was left unstaffed but open and 
that iraqi authorities had pledged it would not be disturbed 
the departure of the american diplomats from kuwait ended a 
fourmonth diplomatic standoff between the united states and iraq 
howell and his colleagues at the us embassy in kuwait had defied 
iraqi orders to close in august gradually all foreigners but the 
british and americans removed their diplomats as iraq cut off 
supplies and posted soldiers outside the compounds 
the trapped us diplomats subsisted for three months on canned 
tuna and boiled water from the embassys swimming pool but were 
allowed emergency supplies in recent weeks britain announced 
wednesday that its last embassy employees would leave within the 
week 
in other developments today 
saddam hussein today repeated his often state view that his 
nation wants peace but that it will gladly wage war rather than 
permit foreign domination of arab oil or land the official iraqi 
news agency reported 
we want peace endeavor to achieve it and work to reach a 
point where no one of us brandishes his sword against the other 
but if the enemies want to push affairs to a military duel then by 
gods help we would win and would walk over their corpses and tread 
on their heads ina quoted saddam as saying 
in another ina report iraq accused the united states of lying 
about the timing of talks in baghdad and washington it said iraq 
had rejected dates proposed by the united states for foreign 
minister tariq azizs trip to washington and a visit by secretary 
of state james a baker iii to baghdad 
the us state department says iraqs insistence on a jan 12 
date for bakers visit is too close to the jan 15 deadline a un 
resolution has set for iraq to relinquish kuwait or face possible 
attack washington said aziz was scheduled to meet president bush 
on monday but that the meeting will not take place unless a date 
has been set for bakers visit 
japans parliament approved 1 billion to help support 
multinational forces deployed against iraq the final portion of 
2 billion already pledged by tokyo in all japan has pledged 4 
billion for efforts to solve the gulf crisis 2 billion for the 
multinational forces and 2 billion in aid for nations suffering 
from the international embargo against iraq todays vote came two 
days after the pentagon accused japan of being slow to send the 
funds 
opec ministers in vienna endorsed maintaining high crude 
production to ease any oil shortages caused by the gulf crisis and 
pledged to sharply reduce their output once it is resolved one oil 
minister said the statement wrapping up the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries meeting should send a signal that 
people need to relax in a time of worry 
in diplomatic moves soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze arrived in turkey for two days of discussions that 
will center on the gulf crisis algerian president chadli bendjedid 
arrived in iran on the third leg of a new arab peace initiative 
bendjedid met with saddam on wednesday and jordans king hussein 
the day before but arab diplomats said he apparently canceled a 
stop in saudi arabia indicating his initiative was in trouble 
us embassy officials at the baghdad airport said that among 
the 94 people leaving on the uscharter were 30 americans 
including three members of the baghdad embassy staff 25 britons 
including three baghdad embassy personnel 16 canadians nine 
japanese and an unspecified number of italians norwegians irish 
and other nationalities 
officials in baghdad said all other foreigners who missed the 
charter could leave later by regular flights or by ground 
transportation 
us officials said the departure of the americans today left 
just one american who had been held hostage at a strategic site he 
was identified as gary oconner of humble texas officials said he 
would go to basra iraq to finalize his business and leave iraq at 
a later date 
the charter flight left as part of iraqs blanket hostage 
release announced one week ago iraq had barred thousands of 
foreigners from travel after its aug 2 invasion of kuwait it held 
hundreds of them mostly americans britons and japanese at 
strategic sites to deter a feared attack by usled forces sent to 
the region in response to the invasion 
before todays flight about 188 americans have been evacuated 
from iraq and kuwait over the last week us officials estimate

episcopalians are caught up in agonizing debate 
over plans to hold their 1991 national convention in arizona now 
that the states voters have rejected a paid holiday honoring 
martin luther king jr 
even if the site remains the same as now seems likely leaders 
say it will be a different sort of convention shorn of celebrative 
frills and highlighting racial justice 
the debate has become so emotionally strained that the episcopal 
churchs presiding bishop the most rev edmond lee browning has 
called a special executive council meeting for jan 5 to consider 
ways to trim down the affair 
after weeks of debate contentious conference calls and 
consultations with church members especially blacks browning said 
he was convinced the church must adhere to its scheduled meeting 
place in phoenix july 1020 
i believe that this rougher road is the one that the church is 
meant to walk he said he has authority to determine the site 
with advice and consent of the executive council of the 25 
millionmember denomination 
the convention wont be business as usual browning said 
suggesting that it could be shortened and modified and also that it 
could offer a powerful witness in arizona to racial equality 
at his invitation south africas anglican archbishop the rev 
desmond tutu widely honored for his struggles against racism 
agreed to lead a rally to open the convention 
brownings comments havent quieted the arguing although the 
denomination has avoided a racial split whites and blacks are on 
both sides of the debate 
twelve of the 99 domestic episcopal dioceses and scores of 
local congregations have formally urged that the triennial 
governing convention either be canceled or held somewhere else 
warnings have come that some elected representatives might 
refuse to take part if the meeting stays in phoenix the 
washington dc diocesan council for example recommended its 
representatives not participate if its in arizona 
in urging another site the diocese of atlanta the birthplace 
of king offered to play host to the convention which usually 
draws more than 10000 church people 
the furor broke out after arizona voters in a nov 6 referendum 
narrowly defeated a proposed state paid holiday honoring the slain 
civil rights leader 
although months of advance planning already had been made for 
the episcopalians onceinthreeyears convention calls quickly 
arose for a switch in plans 
holding the convention in phoenix and the economic benefits 
associated with it would be an inappropriate witness to the 
churchs stand for racial equality the new york diocesan council 
declared 
ohio became a virtual intrastate battleground the ohio diocesan 
convention based in cleveland called for a new site but the 
southern ohio diocese based in cincinnati urged sticking with 
phoenix 
southern ohio bishop herbert thompson a black said that it was 
important to go to phoenix to show support for racial equality and 
that it would be costly and irresponsible to abandon numerous 
contracts made for the convention 
he said pulling out would imply abandoning arizona blacks and 
we need to stand with them at this time to overcome this 
injustice and prejudice 
but ohios suffragan bishop arthur williams jr also black 
said he didnt see how the convention could help much since we 
will spend most of the 20 days in an airconditioned hall or 
eating and sleeping 
ohio bishop james r moodey a white said some money might have 
to be paid to cancel advance guarantees but moral leadership 
not money should guide our decision 
other diocesan bodies calling for moving the meeting included 
the rio grande diocese based in albuquerque nm which includes 
southwestern texas and the new england province which has seven 
dioceses 
many secular and some auxiliary episcopal organizations scrapped 
plans for arizona meetings after the defeat of the king holiday 
the commissioner of the national football league said he will 
recommend the 1993 super bowl be moved from phoenix 
we do not have that choice browning said we are in this 
for the long haul we cannot turn our backs on the injustices done 
to minorities 
he said many arizonans have worked hard to overcome prejudice 
and need support he urged that we stand with them and together 
make a vigorous witness to the dignity of all gods people 
browning said the churchs executive council would discuss ways 
to scale down the convention rather than move it during the special 
meeting next month in elizabeth nj but that question conceivably 
could be opened by the 40member council 
several church leaders who have met with browning have suggested 
the convention should make an economic witness such as 
particularly patronizing minorityowned businesses

a federal judge today refused to order 
president bush to seek permission from congress before any attack 
on iraqi forces in the persian gulf but reaffirmed the power of 
lawmakers to declare war 
us district judge harold greene denied a request by 54 
democratic members of congress for an injunction to force the 
president to seek a declaration of war before launching an attack 
on iraqi troops in kuwait 
but the judge said that in principle the president must seek 
such authorization from congress but he said the issue was not 
ripe for decision because bush has not shown a commitment to a 
definitive course of action 
the judge noted that congress had not debated the issue of 
whether to use military force to drive iraqi troops out of kuwait 
greene noted that only about 10 percent of congress had asked 
for an injunction against the president it would hardly do to 
have the court in effect force a choice upon the congress to 
the effect that unless the rest of the congress votes in favor of 
declaration of war the president and the several hundred thousand 
troops he has dispatched to the saudi arabian desert must be 
immobilized greene said 
unless congress as a whole or by a majority is heard from 
the controversy here cannot be deemed ripe greene said it is 
only ripe if the majority of the congress seeks relief from an 
infringement on its constitutional wardeclaration power that it 
may be entitled to receive it 
greenes decision came as another federal judge royce c 
lamberth dismissed a lawsuit by an army national guard reservist 
seeking his return from the persian gulf until bush gets 
congressional authorization 
unlike greene lamberth held that courts cannot decide the issue 
of whether bush must seek congressional permission to wage war 
because it is essentially a political question outside the province 
of the judiciary 
lamberth dismissed the lawsuit by sgt michael r ange a 
student and former policeman from north carolina who was sent to 
saudi arabia last month when his national guard unit was activated 
greene however held that courts could rule on whether a war 
was so imminent that the president was required under the 
constitution to seek a declaration of war from congress before 
launching an attack 
the court has no hesitation in concluding that an offensive 
entry into iraq by several hundred thousand united states 
servicemen could be described as a war within the meaning of 
article i section 8 clause ll of the constitution 
the court is not prepared to read out of the constitution the 
clause granting to the congress and to it alone the authority to 
declare war he said 
michael ratner an attorney for the center for constitutional 
rights which brought both cases said he was pleased by greenes 
finding that congress has the sole power to declare war 
i would have rather won the case in terms of a legal win but 
to have a federal judge way that to have an offensive war against 
iraq is not in the presidents power is an important decision a 
ringing affirmation of the constitution 
i think its great that he basically affirmed congresss power 
to be the body that gets us into a war ratner said its 
basically telling the president he cant do what he is going to do 
without getting congress to agree beforehand 
but the lawyer said he expected the center would appeal both 
greenes and lamberths decisions to the us circuit court of 
appeals for the district of columbia

retail sales declined 01 percent last month 
the government said thursday in a report analysts said pointed to a 
bleak holiday shopping season 
im looking for a gloomy christmas said economist david 
jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a new york securities dealer 
the consumer has become extremely selective buying practical 
gifts such as clothing and waiting for a bargain even on those 
the report implies that consumers are being very cautious 
agreed sung won sohn an economist with the norwest corp in 
minneapolis people are not buying postponable goods 
sales totaled a seasonally adjusted 1516 billion down from 
1518 billion in october and the first decline since a 01 percent 
drop in may the commerce department reported 
economist rosalind wells of the national retail federation in 
new york said she has not seen much reason to expect the christmas 
shopping pace to pick up soon 
analysts said retail activity would have been even more sluggish 
except for widespread promotions and other incentives to lure 
shoppers while markdowns might prop up sales in one month they 
tend to depress them in following months 
theyre borrowing sales from the future sohn explained 
sales of durable goods usually expensive products expected to 
last more than three years fell 14 percent after rising 06 
percent in october 
automobile sales plummeted 13 percent reversing a 14 percent 
october increase that some analysts said had come largely from 
fleet sales 
excluding automobiles sales inched up 02 percent last month 
while purchases of furniture and other home furnishings rose 03 
percent sales of building materials fell 26 percent 
although purchases of nondurable goods increased 05 percent 
general merchandise and department store sales dropped 05 percent 
sandra shaber an economist with the futures group in 
washington said general merchandise sales are a good barometer of 
consumer sentiment and its telling us that its weak 
its interesting that department store sales for the last 
three months over yearago levels are up less than 20 percent 
she said if its adjusted for inflation its down for the year 
and thats ominous 
the sluggishness was seen earlier when the labor department 
reported the seasonally adjusted loss of 70000 retail jobs in 
november because general merchandise stores were falling short on 
their normal seasonal hirings 
gains were recorded in sales at grocery stores up 05 percent 
apparel stores 08 percent restaurants and bars 04 percent and 
drug stores 02 percent 
gasoline station sales which have been driven up by rising oil 
prices following the iraqi invasion of kuwait slowed to a 07 
percent increase in november they had risen 26 percent in october 
and 56 percent in september

medic alert launched a massive program 
thursday to warn 23000 heart valve recipients in the united states 
and canada about a rare but often fatal defect of an implanted 
heart valve 
anyone who received a bjkorkshiley 60degree convexoconcave 
heart valve is encouraged to call the tollfree hotline for 
information about their valve implant as well as an identification 
card and a bracelet or neck chain identifying them as valve 
recipients 
this is not a recall said dr roger sachs shileys medical 
director 
he said physicians consulted by the company maintain that the 
risk of reimplantation is much higher than the risk of valve 
failure 
medic alert best known its bracelets worn to identify people 
with medical conditions in case of an emergency has joined the 
valve manufacturer pfizer inc in an unprecedented program to 
locate patients who have the valve 
letters will be sent through doctors to patients or directly if 
their doctors cant be located to alert them to signs of possible 
valve failure and to tell them where to get treatment if necessary 
sachs said any sudden change in a patients condition such as 
shortness of breath or weakness should be investigated 
valve fractures have occurred in about seven of every 10000 
patients per year according to the food and drug administration 
the valve was implanted in about 82000 people worldwide between 
1979 and november 1986 when it was pulled from the market about 
295 fractures of the valve were reported to the fda with 178 
deaths resulting 
the company estimates that 23000 recipients are still alive in 
the united states and canada 
the tollfree number to call for information is 18002451492

most state governments will have to cut 
budgets or raise taxes next year to balance their books according 
to a report released thursday 
a slumping economy has reduced state revenue as spending for 
medicaid prisons and education has continued to grow said the 
survey of leading state lawmakers from across the country 
the northeastern states are in the worst financial shape but 
legislative leaders anticipate budget austerity measures in 
twothirds of all states said the survey conducted by the national 
conference of state legislatures 
the economic crunch is as serious as it was in 1982 and the 
slide seems to be progressing at a faster rate than in the 
early 80s maine house speaker john martin told reporters 
many of the states must walk the budget tightrope in the next 
six months because their fiscal year ends in june said martin a 
democrat who is the new president of the conference which is 
meeting this week in washington 
he predicted that it will be about 18 months before state 
finances stabilize 
revenues in 25 states are more than 1 percent below the budgeted 
level for fiscal 1991 the survey found 
contributing to the states woes are federally mandated changes 
in programs such as medicaid with the states paying the bill for 
the revisions 
congress has chosen to transfer the national budget problem to 
state governments the survey stated 
federal tax increases on gasoline tobacco and liquor will cost 
the states 35 billion in revenue over the next five years the 
survey projected with the federal increases cutting into 
consumption 
each of the six new england states is a candidate for tax 
increases the legislative leaders reported 
connecticuts accumulated deficit at the end of fiscal 1992 will 
equal 30 percent of the general fund according to some estimates 
new york enacted a 125 billion tax increase last year and a 
record 18 billion tax boost earlier this year but still faces a 
massive revenue shortfall 
the new york legislature is preparing to approve a 
budgetcutting plan to close a projected 1 billion deficit 
due to financial problems the leading candidates for tax 
increases include pennsylvania michigan north carolina 
california and florida the legislative leaders said 
in the survey the leaders said that 
california faces a revenue shortfall that may reach 1 billion 
in fiscal 1991 with a shortfall of up to 59 billion the 
following year 
despite substantial tax increases last year florida is 
struggling with a mounting budget shortfall 
pennsylvania faces a 15 billion shortfall gov robert p 
casey opposes tax increases and recommends cuts in spending to 
solve the problem 
other toppriority issues in state legislatures next year will 
be tax reform education the environment and reapportionment 
according to the survey 
abortion a top concern of state legislators in the past is not 
a priority item this year according to the survey

weary shoppers ending another day of scouring 
stores for food said thursday they welcomed economic aid from the 
united states and did not feel ashamed because it wasnt a 
handout 
what humiliation said nikolai kropotov as he bundled up 
against the chill of the moscow night no one is humiliated 
the bush administration has promised the soviet union up to 1 
billion in loan guarantees to buy american wheat corn and other 
farm products to stave off food shortages this winter 
you are selling it quite fairly and we are buying it quite 
fairly said kropotov 72 there is no embarrassment 
as he adjusted a cloth sack to secure three loaves bought at 
bread store no 150 in western moscow kropotov said he was 
confident the food the soviet government would buy from the united 
states would reach the people despite the current problems in the 
nations supply system 
expressing similar confidence was viktor rozhkov 55 who was 
waiting in the store while his wife bought bread 
at present i think the food will make it to the stores what 
with the interior ministry the kgb and the police all controlling 
its distribution rozhkov said 
he had some mixed feelings about the aid on the one hand we 
need help but on the other you have to pay for any credit 
rozhkov said 
if it was help simply free of charge it would be 
humiliating he said but as its credit its not 
humiliating 
asked what kind of goods he would like to see purchased with the 
loan guarantees rozhkov replied basic food canned goods 
sausage meat products nowadays we have practically nothing 
others questioned on the street said they would like to see more 
meat butter and milk in the stores 
i want to see all those things that were freely available in 
the shops a year ago said muscovite raisa l lebedinskaya 
it is very good that our relationships are so close she 
said of the current ties with the united states if we receive 
the aid and make friends at such a difficult moment that would be 
wonderful 
a 68yearold woman who wanted to be identified only as katya 
said the us aid was only proper because the soviet union had 
helped other nations for years 
we have been helping other countries a lot and thats why 
everything has disappeared she said why should we be 
embarrassed now i dont think its embarrassing 
apparently referring to the 2500 metric tons of aid the soviet 
union has received from abroad in recent weeks katya said its 
not only the united states theres also east germany west 
germany italy switzerland all are helping 
vasily i tarasov who was hurrying home with a plastic bag in 
each hand viewed the us economic assistance as needed help from 
a friend 
we are to blame said tarasov 75 we allowed it the 
whole nation is to blame and now the whole nation has to escape 
from this

the senate ethics committee is trying to get 
an inside view of charles h keating jrs dealings with five 
senators by questioning a former top aide of the savings and loan 
operator 
james grogan who served as keatings lobbyist was believed to 
have extensive knowledge about keatings ties to five senators 
under investigation by the panel and he had extensive contacts 
himself with the lawmakers and their staffs 
grogan appeared under a grant of immunity before the ethics 
panel in second day of closeddoor meetings today 
sen warren rudman rnh vice chairman of the panel emerged 
at an afternoon break and said the closeddoor questioning could 
continue into friday 
were still in executive session and theres no reason for me 
to think we might not be finishing the executive session 
tomorrow rudman said i cant comment at all on anything he 
said 
the committee ordered grogan to testify in hopes he would 
provide information from a side that has not yet been heard in 16 
days of public hearings that of keating whose lincoln savings 
and loan association collapsed in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of 
more than 2 billion 
rudman said no final decision had been made on public 
questioning of grogan committee special counsel robert s bennett 
said grogan would undergo public questioning at some point 
probably 
grogan was vice president of lincoln and corporate counsel of 
its parent company american continental corp of phoenix he was 
keatings main liaison with capitol hill and had extensive dealings 
with the five senators alan cranston dcalif john mccain 
rariz donald w riegle jr dmich john glenn dohio and 
dennis deconcini dariz 
keating and his aides have refused to testify invoking their 
fifth amendment right against selfincrimination 
grogan was granted immunity from prosecution based on his 
testimony the committee said it would not provide immunity to 
secure the testimony of keating who is under federal investigation 
and has been indicted on state fraud charges in california 
grogans name has surfaced often during the public hearings he 
arranged for political donations to lawmakers and was point man in 
soliciting congressional help for keatings furious battle with 
thrift regulators in an unsuccessful effort to save irvine 
califbased lincoln 
the committee did not decide to compel his testimony until late 
in its investigation however 
keating and associates donated 13 million to the five senators 
and their campaigns and favorite causes the lawmakers also 
intervened with thrift regulators on lincolns behalf the panel is 
considering whether the donations and the intervention were 
connected 
grogan undertook several activities that could spark the 
committees interest he 
arranged for keatings contributions to three 
voterregistration projects supported by cranston keating donated 
850000 
set in motion a complaint by cranstons banking aide to 
regulators about their tough enforcement stance against lincoln a 
career regulator said the complaint delayed the eventual takeover 
of lincoln although the cranston staffer carolyn d jordan 
denied pressuring regulators 
played a role in arranging two crcial meetings with 
regulators one on april 2 1987 involved all of the senators 
except riegle the second a week later included all the senators 
regulators testified the senators were hostile and had made up 
their minds beforehand that lincoln received unfair treatment 
was told in a memo from keating to try to get a senior career 
regulator fired for his hardnosed stance against lincoln

nat howell us ambassador to kuwait is 
coming home a hero a symbol of americas resistance to a tyrants 
coercion 
he drank the same dirty water he slept outside with the flies 
and the heat said jack rinehart an engineer from stover mo 
and one of those trapped in the embassy hes a hero like john 
wayne 
w nathaniel howell left baghdad on thursday on what was said to 
be the last charter plane carrying foreigners from iraq and 
occupied kuwait 
howell was trapped in kuwait when iraq invaded the country aug 
2 for three months he defied saddam husseins orders to close the 
diplomatic compound which had been surrounded by iraqi troops 
the bush administration this week ordered howell to evacuate the 
embassy saying he had completed his job by helping us citizens 
leave kuwait 
the us embassy in iraq remains open but ambassador april 
glaspie had left the country on vacation three days before the 
surprise invasion the charge daffaires is running the embassy in 
her absence and the administration says it will remain open and 
staffed 
howell was packing his bags closing out a threeyear stint in 
kuwait when iraqi troops stormed over the border his wife had 
already left for home 
after howell refused to leave the embassy the compound was 
deprived of electricity and running water the eight diplomats and 
19 american civilians survived on canned tuna and rice they 
planted gardens and drank the water from the swimming pool 
the 50yearold howell clad in an orange shirt and virginia 
tech shorts helped shovel when the americans dug a latrine trench 
and a well when they struck water good enough for washing they 
showed their defiance to the iraqi guards by washing their cars 
meanwhile howell had to keep underground links open to the 
hundreds of americans in kuwait who were in hiding afraid of being 
captured and used by the iraqis as human shields 
his valorous performance was part of the basis for our 
continuing hopes of a peaceful solution said ted wilkinson 
president of the american foreign service association 
wilkinson said it was the kind of discipline youd expect 
from an experienced field officer who was also posted to egypt 
during the 1967 sixday war and to beirut during lebanons 
mid1970s civil war 
howell left kuwait only after being assured that all americans 
who wanted to leave the country had been allowed to go 
howell and his staff performed courageously said white 
house press secretary marlin fitzwater they deserve to be taken 
out 
the ambassador accompanied by barbara bodine deputy chief of 
mission and three other diplomats were the last americans to 
evacuate kuwait city compound they were to arrive in the united 
states on friday 
rinehart the american engineer described howell as a 
tremendous leader i told him i trusted my life to him 
howell is reportedly thinking about retiring after 25 years in 
the foreign service but if he decides to stay on its likely that 
his future will be bright 
he performed with distinction and he should be recognized 
wilkinson said 
glaspie the first american woman ambassador to an arab country 
has been in the united states since the invasion and in marked 
contrast to howells triumphant return home glaspie has faced 
criticism 
she met saddam a week before the invasion and according to 
transcripts released by iraq praised the iraqi president for his 
extraordinary efforts to rebuild his country glaspie reassured 
saddam that the united states took no official position on iraqs 
border dispute with kuwait 
the transcripts never challenged by the state department 
showed that glaspie didnt respond directly to saddams threats of 
terrorism if the united states thwarted his aims she stressed that 
the bush administration opposed economic sanctions against iraq 
glaspie has since kept a low profile behind state department 
walls while her secondincommand charge daffaires joseph c 
wilson iv has earned accolades for his tireless efforts on behalf 
of the american hostages 
marshall wiley president of the usiraq business forum and 
former ambassador to oman said glaspie probably will be unfairly 
blamed for not predicting the invasion 
but wiley praised both glaspie and howell as highly competent 
diplomats and said glaspie shouldnt be faulted for reflecting 
policy set in washington 
it was us policy that was mistaken he said

the 1 billion in farm credit extended to the 
soviet union could buy most of the kansas wheat crop this year or 
all the corn grown in ohio or all the soybeans produced in 
missouri and mississippi 
and you can bet that producers of oats barley rice dairy 
products and dozens of other farm goods will be clamoring for 
moscows attention too 
wheat could be the majority of it i would think said barry 
jenkins of the national association of wheat growers we may have 
something going for us because they need some flour real quick 
but theres going to be people lined up along with us he 
noted 
citing the tough times difficult times facing the soviet 
people president bush announced wednesday he was waiving through 
june 1991 longstanding trade restrictions and handed the soviet 
union credit lines of 1 billion for farm products and 300 million 
for manufactured goods 
ironically bushs announcement proved bearish on the market 
because the grain trade had expected the president to give the 
soviets an even higher credit limit 
grain futures opened sharply lower thursday on the chicago board 
of trade and one analyst said the credit package was 
disappointing that traders had expected a figure in the range of 
15 billion to 3 billion the level urged earlier by sen bob 
dole rkan 
the agriculture department will work with soviet officials to 
work out details of the credit package including schedules for 
financing and repayment the usda underwrites the loans which are 
made by private lenders under the departments export credit 
programs 
theoretically if a fourway split could be arranged with each 
interest group getting a 250 million piece of the pie it could 
mean soviet purchases of 
about 105 million bushels of wheat based on a recent us farm 
price average of 239 per bushel 
about 114 million bushels of corn at an average farm price of 
219 per bushel 
about 45 million bushels of soybeans at the recent average us 
farm price of 551 per bushel 
and miscellaneous purchases with the remaining 250 million 
of rice oats barley dairy products meat and various processed 
food items 
actual selling prices to the soviets would be higher than the 
farm prices however since transportation charges to move grain 
from inland points to port loading facilities must be computed 
too 
the soviet union has been buying large quantities of us grain 
since the early 1970s in recent years the purchases have been 
under longterm agreements that commit both countries to minimum 
annual levels 
in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 the soviets bought 203 
million metric tons of us grain including almost 165 million 
tons of corn and 38 million tons of wheat 
that was the equivalent of 650 million bushels of corn and 140 
million bushels of wheat roughly 14 billion worth corn at 
todays farm prices and 335 million worth of wheat 
in all last years farm export value to the soviet union was 
reported by usda at more than 298 billion for all commodities 
down from 329 billion in 198889 
exports are vital to american grain farmers particularly wheat 
producers whose crops far exceed domestic food needs 
a large harvest this year more than 274 billion bushels is 
adding to the us surplus and holding down market prices 
out of the 1990 harvest only 745 million bushels about 27 
percent of the total wheat output will be needed as food even 
with an increase in using wheat to feed livestock inventories will 
increase by the time another harvest is ready in 1991

the postal service is organizing a nationwide 
computer file to help mass mailers keep accurate addresses but it 
wont contain names and poses no threat to privacy officials say 
the usa file for universal system of addressing is being 
compiled in district postal offices and will be assembled on a 
national basis next year said dick strasser senior assistant 
postmaster general for marketing and customer service 
the postal service is banned under a privacy protection law from 
compiling lists of americans names and addresses strasser 
stressed that the usa file will not contain any names and is 
merely a system of assuring that street addresses are correct 
the impetus for the system is increasing automation in the 
postal service which plans to give mailers discounts for letters 
sorted in the order that a letter carrier walks his or her route 
mailers will be able to take their mailing lists to a 
contractor which will match it with the usa file and provide them 
a list of errors explained stresser 
for example a if a mailer listed someone at 155 johnson street 
the usa file could tell them that there is a north and south 
johnson street in that zip code so they need to check for 
themselves which is correct for their mailing

fourmonth diplomatic standoff between the united states and iraq 
howell and his colleagues at the us embassy in kuwait had defied 
iraqi orders to close in august gradually all foreigners but the 
british and americans removed their diplomats as iraq cut off 
supplies and posted soldiers outside the compounds

permit foreign domination of arab oil or land the official iraqi 
news agency reported 
we want peace endeavor to achieve it and work to reach a 
point where no one of us brandishes his sword against the other

on their heads ina quoted saddam s saying 
in another ina report iraq accused the united states of lying 
about the timing of talks in baghdad and washington it said iraq 
had rejected dates proposed by the united states for foreign 
minister tariq azizs trip to washington and a visit by secretary 
of state james a baker iii to baghdad 
the us state department says iraqs insistence on a jan 12 
date for bakers visit is too close to the jan 15 deadline a un 
resolution has set for iraq to relinquish kuwait or face possible 
attack washington said aziz was scheduled to meet president bush 
on monday but that the meeting will not take place unless a date 
has been set for bakers visit

the man whose projection of an 
earthquake set off disaster drills and a media storm still refuses 
to talk about it 
iben brownings 5050 projection of a quake along the midwests 
new madrid fault on or near dec 2 was dismissed by scientists but 
in some communities residents left town for the weekend school 
districts canceled classes and police officials barred troopers 
from taking vacations that week 
he based the projection on unusually high tidal action 
the fault running from marked tree ark to southern illinois 
is capable of setting off major quakes in the early 1800s it rang 
church bells in washington dc 
but nothing happened on dec 2 
browning 72 a science consultant for businesses refused to be 
interviewed wednesday hanging up twice on the associated press 
no one is going to get ahold of me browning said from his 
sandia park home im not going to give any interviews at all 
brownings wife florence also said he wouldnt comment 
it has not done any good in the past she said 
brownings daughter evelyn garriss had been speaking for him 
but there was no answer at her home 
however mrs garriss said tuesday in missouri that tidal forces 
did not trigger a major quake in the new madrid fault zone because 
the gun wasnt loaded 
mrs garriss who spoke at the missouri governors conference on 
agriculture in osage beach mo said small earthquakes in the 
region during the fall apparently reduced the potential for a 
larger quake 
apparently everything that could be triggered didnt wait so 
there was nothing there she said 
none of the tremors caused any significant damage 
brownings projection was dismissed in october by a group of 
scientists who evaluated it for the us geological survey they 
said it had no credibility and lacked scientific basis 
one missouri scientist who was criticized because he refused to 
disassociate himself from brownings projection has given up his 
job 
dr david stewart said tuesday he was stepping down as head of 
the center for earthquake studies at southeast missouri state 
university to ensure that the criticism doesnt affect the center 
itself

the pentagon on thursday said it had 
unintentionally understated the value of allied nations 
contributions to the us military operation in the persian gulf 
pete williams the chief pentagon spokesman said figures 
released tuesday on allied contributions included only the cash and 
military materials that have been received by us forces in the 
gulf not those still en route 
german officials took strong exception to williams remarks on 
tuesday in which he indicated that bonn and tokyo had fallen short 
of delivering the cash and materials they promised 
williams on tuesday had said germany delivered 337 million in 
cash and materials as of oct 31 compared with its promise to 
provide 15 billion for operation desert shield by dec 31 he 
also said japan had given 426 million against a pledge of 2 
billion 
on thursday williams said the current figure for japan was 
actually 476 million and that the united states knew that both 
japan and germany had arranged substantial additional support that 
would be received by us forces in the weeks ahead 
he said germany for example was going to send 30 additional 
chemical detection vehicles for us use in saudi arabia those 
vehicles are valued at 65 million he said also the german air 
force is handling some air missions in europe that normally are the 
responsibility of the us air force williams said 
were very pleased with what our allies are doing williams 
said adding that he believed the allies would deliver all the 
assistance they promised by years end 
the pentagon spokesman said the misunderstanding stemmed 
from the pentagons method of accounting for materials donated to 
desert shield 
somewhere in washington where all things get twisted in 
strange ways somebody has to make a decision about how we tally 
this he said at what point in the system do you count it and 
we simply decided that the easiest way and the way that makes the 
most sense is when we receive it 
that necessarily understates the total effort thats going on 
out there

an environmental protection agency report linking 
electromagnetic fields to leukemia and brain cancer in children 
will be released next week after being held up by the white house 
science adviser the epa said thursday 
some epa scientists said the white house was wrong to delay the 
report but the white house science advisers office told the 
agency it was concerned the report would alarm the public epa 
officials said 
similar reservations were expressed by assistant secretary of 
health james mason the epa officials said 
they were concerned not about the accuracy of the report 
said robert mcgaughy who supervised the reports preparation 
they were concerned about how people would react to the news 
there is a concern that people will take too seriously the 
suggestions that there may be some connection with cancer 
neither white house science adviser d allan bromley nor mason 
were available for interviews thursday their offices said 
the report looked at all kinds of electromagnetic fields from 
those produced by highpower electrical transmission lines to those 
produced by household appliances 
virtually everyone is exposed to such fields every day 
epidemiological or statistical studies have linked residential 
exposures to childhood cancer and occupational exposures to cancer 
in adults said david savitz of the university of north carolina in 
chapel hill the author of one of the most important of those 
studies 
laboratory studies have suggested that living cells can respond 
to electromagnetic fields and researchers have hypotheses as to 
why the fields might theoretically cause cancer he said 
there are credible scientific suggestions of adverse health 
effects from these exposures but the overall body of evidence is 
not conclusive said savitz 
the epa report is a review of all existing studies on 
electromagnetic fields and cancer a draft prepared last summer 
concluded that the studies show a consistent pattern of response 
which suggests but does not prove a causal link between 
household power distribution systems and certain cancers in 
children 
the childrens cancers were leukemia brain cancer and lymphoma 
the report said 
the draft has been revised once but our current conclusions 
are very similar mcgaughy said 
david bayliss one of the authors said he was frustrated by the 
delay in releasing the report he said it had been scheduled to go 
out nov 27 
what is the use of having an environmental protection agency 
if youre going to withhold information from the public bayliss 
said i thought the epa was for letting people know about health 
problems or possible health problems 
mcgaughy said the report was delayed because of questions raised 
by bromley and that mason later expressed some of the same 
objections 
mcgaughy said the questions were raised by bromley at a meeting 
mcgaughy and other epa officials attended in bromleys office on 
nov 26 the day before the scheduled release 
the meeting with mason took place dec 6 mcgaughy said 
erich bretthauer the epas assistant administrator for research 
and development said it was natural for bromley and mason to be 
involved because an interagency federal committee that they 
oversee is also studying electromagnetic fields and health hazards 
it is an important area many people have concerns about it 
including dr bromleys office and dr masons office bretthauer 
said the report will be released next week he said 
bretthauer said bromley and mason disagreed with the epa over 
the nuances of the epidemiological studies considered in the 
report i dont think they see the data the way we do 
bretthauer said when asked to clarify the disagreements he said 
im going to refer you to them 
in an earlier version prepared last spring the agency 
tentatively proposed classifying electromagnetic fields as a 
class b1 carcinogen meaning that they are a probable source of 
human cancer 
but when it went through the peer review inside the agency 
that recommendation was taken out some say with malice and some 
say without said david janes the epa administrator who 
commissioned the study he is now retired from the epa 
janes said he thought the epa report would have a great impact 
because of the nature of th risk i think it will create a lot 
of apprehension among folks especially since this is one of those 
you cant see it feel it or taste it and an individuals 
exposure is not under an individuals control

president mikhail s gorbachev is asking the west 
the kgb and the army to help solve his countrys food shortages 
while he tackles the much tougher task of trying to keep the soviet 
union intact 
all his efforts appear aimed at buying time through what 
promises to be a hard winter and he has no guarantee of success 
gorbachev got a boost this week from president bush who 
promised to back loans for the kremlin to buy up to 1 billion in 
american farm products and 300 million in manufactured goods 
through june 
other nations fearing food riots that mcould jeopardize 
gorbachevs reforms also are rushing to help the soviets 
at home gorbachev is trying both the carrot and the stick in 
his efforts to reassert central control over the nations 
disintegrating political and economic structure 
he says he will use force to prevent profiteering 
but neither threats nor force are likely to persuade the 
governments of the 15 republics to agree to his proposal that their 
economies remain under central control 
both topics will be debated monday when the national congress of 
peoples deputies convenes in the kremlin for what promises to be a 
tumultuous session 
conservative lawmakers are urging gorbachev to declare a state 
of emergency and he has partially obliged them by replacing the 
moderate interior minister with generals from the kgb and the army 
additionally he has ordered the kgb the army and the interior 
ministry to stop workers in the state distribution system from 
stealing food and selling it on the black marke 
deliveries of most food products are running from 15 to 44 
percent below 1989 levels according to figures released this week 
by the council of ministers which blamed much of the drop on 
pilfering and profiteering 
tough law enforcement is needed when the old administrative 
system is being withdrawn and the new market is not in place to 
regulate supply and demand and prices kgb maj gen alexander 
n karbainov told a news conference thursday at the agencys 
lubyanka headquarters 
he said the measures could last six months maybe a year 
depending on the results 
the food shortage appears most acute in big russian cities like 
moscow and leningrad and much milder in the countryside and most 
of the 14 other republics times also seem lean in armenia and 
moldavia two republics beset by ethnic unrest 
to feed the cities gorbachev has announced that during the 
first three months of 1991 his government will spend 21 billion 
rubles 357 billion to import food 
bottlenecks in ports and on railroads threaten to prevent that 
food from reaching the cities however say kgb and army officials 
mobilizing to solve the problem still they say it is unlikely 
that people will starve 
in this country there is no such situation as we had in 1921 
when there was famine said karbainov referring to the russian 
civil war in which millions died from lack of food 
feeding the soviet people this winter could be childs play 
compared to holding the soviet union together 
all the republics including the russian federation have 
declared some form of economic and political autonomy 
in response gorbachev is proposing a union treaty that would 
form a new legal charter for the federation his version would 
retain central control over defense and national security as well 
as energy transportation and other key industries 
russian president boris yeltsin and 10 other republic leaders 
have agreed to join the treaty negotiations but they demand 
control of natural resources on their own soil such as oil 
natural gas and gold deposits in russia oil and coal of 
kazakhstan or rich wheat fields in the ukraine 
the three baltic republics of latvia lithuania and estonia 
plus moldavia which was part of romania until world war ii have 
refused to join the talks 
gorbachevs chances of winning the republics approval of his 
draft proposal appear slim 
and while it may be possible to send the kgb and the army to 
ports rail yards and warehouses to frighten food industry workers 
it is quite another thing to use force simultaneously against 15 
republics in various stages of rebellion 
in the long range we must stick to democratic methods said 
karbainov the kgb general say we cracked down returned to the 
methods of the past then in 10 years wed right back where we 
started 
equals

in moscow has covered soviet affairs since 1981

police groups supporting gun control urged the 
supreme court on thursday to reject a case that seeks to overturn a 
government ban on civilian ownership of new machine guns 
it is absolutely vital that the sale and possession of new 
machine guns stay illegal said district of columbia police chief 
isaac fulwood speaking for the international association of chiefs 
of police machine guns have no place in civilized society 
the national rifle association which supports the case brought 
by gunsmith jd farmer jr of smyrna ga was the chief target of 
the halfdozen law enforcement officials at a news conference 
i defy the nra leadership to name one good reason to overturn 
the machine gun ban said don cahill of the national fraternal 
order of police machine guns are designed to kill large groups 
of people and do so quickly drug dealers and others bent on 
violence are the only ones who need machine guns 
the supreme court has not yet decided whether to take up the 
case of farmer vs stephen e higgins director of the federal 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
a threejudge panel of the atlantabased 11th circuit court of 
appeals decided unanimously in favor of higgins on july 11 
the groups represented by fulwood and cahill are among seven 
major police organizations plus the center to prevent handgun 
violence that submitted a brief to the supreme court on thursday 
urging it not to hear farmers case 
a great deal is at stake said dennis a henigan director 
of the center to prevent handgun violence legal action project 
if the supreme court were to endorse anything close to the nras 
doctrine it would threaten every sensible gun law in this 
country 
the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms says a 1986 gun 
control act amendment prohibits private ownership of machine guns 
made after may 18 1986 still legal is civilian possession of the 
125000 privately owned machine guns made before then and the 
transfer of those older weapons as long as new owners obtain atfs 
approval such approval requires fingerprinting background checks 
endorsement by the local police chief or sheriff and a 200 fee per 
gun 
but nra attorney richard e gardiner contends the government is 
misinterpreting the 1986 legislation 
what it says is that any machine gun made after that date can 
be possessed under the authority of the united states 
gardiner said 
while the government said that limits ownership of new machine 
guns to law enforcement agencies and the military gardiner said it 
means ownership is open to anyone meeting atf standards such as 
those established for individuals buying the older weapons 
theres a section in the gun control act that specifically 
exempts all government agencies from the act he said it would 
be meaningless for congress to create two exemptions for the same 
people 
the farmer case would not affect machine gun ownership standards 
established by the 1934 national firearms act such as 
registration required approvals and the fee gardiner said 
he rejected the idea that drug dealers and other lawbreakers 
would rush to buy new machine guns if the supreme court ruled in 
farmers favor 
theyre not the kind of people who like to submit forms to the 
federal government gardiner said 
but david b mitchell the police chief of prince georges 
county said 
the simple fact is that drug dealers and others bent on 
killing are armed with some of the most sophisticated guns 
available and they dont hesitate to use them 
every concerned american must truly believe that gun violence 
will escalate even more if these military weapons are available 
again to the general public said mitchell representing the 
police executive research forum 
other groups joining the brief were the national association of 
police organizations the national organization of black law 
enforcement executives the major city chiefs and the police 
foundation

a judge today threw out a murder charge 
against dr jack kevorkian in the death of an alzheimers disease 
patient who used his socalled suicide machine to take her 
life 
kevorkian turned and shook hands with a defense attorney after 
clarkston district judge gerald mcnally dismissed a firstdegree 
murder charge in the death of janet adkins 
mcnally said prosecutors failed to prove kevorkian planned and 
carried out adkins death june 4 adding she not kevorkian caused 
the death mcnally noting michigan has no specific law against 
assisting suicide said it is up to the legislature to clarify 
state law 
oakland county chief assistant prosecutor michael modelski said 
he would appeal 
mcnallys ruling came after a twoday preliminary hearing to 
determine whether kevorkian of suburban royal oak should stand 
trial an outspoken advocate of the concept of doctorassisted 
suicide for the terminally ill kevorkian has acknowledged hooking 
up adkins to his machine which put a lethal combination of drugs 
into her bloodstream after she pushed a button 
the only alternatives available to the judge today were allowing 
the firstdegree murder charge to go to trial or throwing it out 
he could not substitute a lesser charge 
on wednesday attorneys introduced a suicide note purportedly 
signed by adkins saying she freely chose to have kevorkian help 
her commit suicide before she deteriorated further from 
alzheimers 
adkins 54 of portland ore died shortly after noon june 4 
later that day kevorkian let police search his van and seize his 
device before offering a statement about his role in adkinss 
death 
but the criminal charge punishable by up to life imprisonment 
wasnt filed until dec 3 oakland county prosecutor richard 
thompson filed the charge shortly after the release of an autopsy 
report concluding that adkins committed suicide 
after the first day of the hearing wednesday defense attorney 
geoffrey fieger said the evidence against kevorkian amounted to 
zippo theres less than nothing 
detective sgt david haire of the michigan state police had 
testified that he and his partner were called to the campground 
where the death took place and met kevorkian who told them he had 
been contacted by adkins and her husband ronald 
they apparently had learned of dr kevorkians suicide machine 
through the press haire said 
the device an oblong metal box containing an electric motor 
and supporting a metal rack from which three vials were suspended 
was entered as evidence wednesday 
another witness michael podeszwik an investigator with the 
county medical examiners office said kevorkian had blood on his 
hands and pants when they met at the campground kevorkian said he 
had been having some difficulty inserting the needle in adkins 
arm podeszwik said 
the investigator said kevorkian handed him two pieces of paper 
in the first adkins wrote that she wanted to end her life before 
her alzheimers disease progressed any further in the second she 
asked that her eyes be donated for transplanting 
this is a decision taken in a normal state of mind and is 
freely considered podeszwik read from the first note i have 
alzheimers disease and i dont want it to progress any further i 
dont want to put myself or my family through any more of this 
terrible disease 
under questioning by assistant prosecutor michael modelski 
podeszwik acknowledged he didnt know whether adkins wrote the 
notes 
the first witness dr jacob chason said that of the more than 
10000 brains he has autopsied in his career only one showed more 
deterioration from alzheimers disease than adkins brain 
alzheimers disease is a progressive irreversible disease 
characterized by degeneration of the brain cells

oliver tambo president of the 
african national congress came home thursday after 30 years in 
exile and was welcomed joyously by his supporters to a country far 
different from the one he left 
the arrival of the ailing tambo brought the core of the anc 
leadership together and free in south africa for the first time 
since before the black opposition group was outlawed in april 1960 
his longtime anc colleagues nelson mandela and walter sisulu 
both were freed from prison in the past 14 months as part of 
reforms that have eliminated major apartheid laws and led to talks 
with the whiteled government 
the day for which we have all waited has come mandela told 
cheering supporters at an airport welcoming ceremony comrade 
oliver tambo president of the anc is here 
it was a bittersweet return as the 73yearold tambo clearly 
was debilitated by a stroke suffered more than a year ago he did 
not address the crowd of more than 5000 that waited for hours at 
the airport 
tambo appeared far weaker and older than mandela 72 who spent 
27 years in prison 
he returned during a week in which scores of blacks died in the 
chronic factional fighting involving anc supporters and rivals that 
has wracked black townships around johannesburg for months 
tambos chartered plane arrived from lusaka zambia nearly two 
hours later than expected at johannesburgs airport 
outside pandemonium broke out when thousands of supporters 
spotted the anc delegation led by mandelas red mercedes arriving 
at the terminal 
people who had been dancing singing and chanting viva tambo 
rushed toward the cars while a few police officers stood with arms 
spread trying to hold them back 
the exuberant jostling became a panicked run when police brought 
out dogs to clear a path for mandela his wife winnie and other anc 
leaders a local radio station said 18 people suffered dog bites 
police reported no serious injuries 
tambo using a cane and walking with a limp chatted with the 
anc leaders on the tarmac embracing many of them and smiling 
broadly asked how he was feeling he said only fine fine 
fine 
it was his first time in south africa since march 1960 when as 
anc deputy president he was given the task of leading the groups 
external mission from exile 
the whiteled government banned the anc and other antiapartheid 
groups the following month and they remained outlawed until last 
february tambo was elected anc president in 1969 
tambo is not as well known as mandela who came to symbolize 
south africas antiapartheid movement during his imprisonment but 
he is widely regarded as the man who brought the anc through its 
darkest days as a struggling exiled liberation movement 
more than any other person i know in exile where we are today 
can be attributed to his work his humanity his brilliance as a 
strategist and his capacity to hold people together said joe 
slovo head of the ancallied south african communist party 
tambo suffered a serious stroke in august 1989 and his health 
prevented him from returning immediately after the anc was 
legalized he is expected to return to london in about three weeks 
for more treatment after attending a threeday anc conference that 
opens friday 
after his arrival tambo appeared on an upper level of the 
airport parking garage overlooking the expectant crowd they 
roared as tambo his wife adelaide and nelson and winnie mandela 
raised their fists in salute 
tambo had to be helped from the car and to the rail overlooking 
the crowd there were some shouts of anger when mandela said the 
anc president would not speak 
at the present moment he wishes just to say he is happy to be 
amongst us mandela said we know we are expressing your wishes 
when we say we welcome him with open arms as one of the greatest 
heros of africa 
mandela said tambo would speak sunday at an anc rally and he 
appealed for the crowd to disperse peacefully minutes later 
police fanned out with dogs and quickly cleared the area 
slovo and former antiapartheid parliamentarian helen suzman 
expressed disappointment that tambo was returning at a time of 
violence in black townships since august more than 1000 people 
have died in the townships around johannesburg mostly in fighting 
between supporters of the anc and the rival zulubased inkatha 
freedom party 
i think like all of us he tambo will feel extremely let 
down by what is going on and hell also feel angered by the role 
sinister elements are playing in stoking up these primitive 
emotions said slovo voicing the common anc allegation that 
security forces arebehind the factional unrest 
the government and police have denied the accusations

those werent jeers but cheers 
for roseanne barr who revved up her infamous singing voice at a 
moraleboosting show for those left behind by operation desert 
shield 
the star of the tv comedy roseanne gave a free performance 
wednesday night to about 800 marines spouses and children at the 
marine corps airground combat center 
many thought she wouldnt try singing after her offkey 
rendition of the national anthem at a san diego padres baseball

getting 32500 each thanks to a court settlement stemming from a 
series of concerts that michael jackson canceled 
attorneys thomas wampold and aaron haleva also will get a hefty 
35000 for their work representing ticketbuyers who sued over the 
canceled concerts in october and november 1988 jackson said he was 
ill when he canceled the shows 
jackson the company handling ticket sales for the concerts and 
the city of tacoma agreed wednesday to contribute 32500 each to

contribution and the defendants agreed on northwest harvest 
ticketmaster inc which had been accused in the lawsuit of 
improperly withholding 225 to 325 in service fees it charged

settlement 
the los angelesbased company said it was making the 
contributions to northwest harvest and the seattle youth symphony 
as a charitable gesture to the community

the town of brentwood has little in 
common with the posh los angeles neighborhood with the same name 
and theyre more than 350 miles apart but its post office is the 
lost and found for celebrity mail 
weve gotten letters for sylvester stallone janet jackson 
michael jackson betty white george carlin marcus allen james 
garner harrison ford and madonna said laura de concepcion 
superintendent of postal services in brentwood 
thats the brentwood in eastern contra costa county east of san 
francisco 
we even got one for president reagan because he has a ranch 
down there somewhere she added 
the post office with a staff of 17 gets nearly 200 pieces of 
misdirected mail each day many of those letters and packages are 
intended for celebrities who live in brentwood the neighborhood in 
los angeles 
its not funny said postmaster manuel vilchez it creates 
a lot more work for the postal service its timeconsuming and 
probably irritating to the people who send the letters 
most of the letters end up in the town of 10000 rather than the 
la neighborhood because of addled addresses they either give the 
city as brentwood but use the los angeles zip code 90049 or 
indicate a los angeles street with the brentwood north zip code 
94513 
de concepcion agrees that getting so much mail with the wrong 
address gives her and her colleagues extra work but it has its 
good points 
it kind of breaks the monotony of the day she said every 
time we get a letter for a celebrity we always make a scene about 
it its very exciting for us 
ive never had a telephone call from a celebrity looking for 
their mail but im waiting she said

the federal communications commission on 
thursday proposed new rules that could return to some cities the 
right to regulate basic cable television rates 
under existing rules only about 3 percent of the nations 
9500plus cable tv systems are under price restraints and there 
have been rising complaints that cable systems raise prices 
willynilly and get away with poor service 
the proposed new rules adopted on a 50 vote would make it 
tougher for cable systems to avoid price regulation while at the 
same time avoiding what fcc officials view as heavyhanded 
controls 
the proposal says local communities may regulate a cable 
systems basic tier of services which includes network 
broadcast stations unless one of the three following conditions 
exist 
there are six or more unduplicated overtheair channels 
available and the cable system is subscribed to by less than 50 
percent of the tv homes in a community 
there are other multichannel service providers in the 
community such as microwave cable or direct broadcast satellites 
that are available to 50 percent of the homes with cable and are 
actually being subscribed to by 10 percent of those homes 
the cable system offers a minimum level of service and programs 
at a reasonable price that is comparable to communities in which 
there is effective competition this socalled good actor clause is 
favored by a number of fcc commissioners 
fcc officials would not speculate on how many cable systems 
could avoid rate reregulation under the new proposals 
following a period of public comment the commission will adopt 
final rules sometime next year 
fcc chairman alfred sikes said the proposals would give some 
measure of consumer protection and some assurance of fairness 
to the cable tv industry 
sikes has championed competition among cable systems and 
satellite broadcasters as a means of guaranteeing continued growth 
in the cable industry and holding prices down for subscribers 
national cable television association president james mooney 
however said the fcc proposals could hurt the cable industry 
however moderate the intentions of the fcc this proposal 
raises the prospect of the government inhibiting the future 
development of cable programming by crimping its economic life 
blood mooney said 
gene kimmelman legislative director of the consumer federation 
of america said the rules dont get at the root problem pricing 
for the most popular cable programs such as espn the turner 
networks and discovery channel which cable systems typically dont 
offer on the basic tier 
this will offer only the slightest protection for consumers 
and still leave them totally at the mercy of cable operators for 
the most popular programs kimmelman said 
congress this year nearly passed a cable rate reregulation 
bill the legislation passed the house but a white house veto 
threat held up a senate measure that included provisions 
restricting the ability of cable programmers to hold exclusive 
rights to programs 
sen joseph lieberman dconn said thursday that congress was 
likely to approve new legislation next year 
any new law must cover the services for which most people buy 
cable not just the services they can receive for free lieberman 
said 
prior to enactment of the 1984 cable act most local cable 
franchising authorities were allowed to regulate the prices cable 
tv systems charged for their basic tiers but effective in 1987 
the cable act removed local regulation except for cable systems 
with effective competition 
the act still allows regulated cable systems to raise rates for 
basic service 5 percent annually without approval of local 
franchising authorities 
in the wake of deregulation cable tv prices soared the 
congressional general accounting office found that rates for basic 
service climbed 29 percent on average between december 1986 and 
october 1988 four times the rate of inflation at the same time 
the average number of basic channels offered increased from 24 to 
30 on the lowestpriced basic tier 
the gao found this year that prices climbed another 10 percent 
in 1989 or twice the inflation rate 
the cable industry said it was only playing catchup after years 
of local regulation that held prices artificially low 
cable systems today arent totally free from regulation they 
pay hundreds of millions of dollars in franchising fees annually 
and are required to provide community access channels and make 
certain other public service commitments

broadway celebrated the musical theater of 
leonard bernstein with songs and remembrances by family friends 
and performers who appeared in such shows as west side story 
on the town and candide 
i cannot remember any more joyous collaboration than we had on 
west side story said jerome robbins who directed and 
choreographed bernsteins best known theater work i think 
lennys music was the lifeblood of that show you couldnt have had 
those dances without the music 
betty comden who with her partner adolph green collaborated 
with bernstein on wonderful town and on the town recalled 
the first time she met the composer in the early 1940s bernstein 
talked and played the piano all night long 
i went home woke my mother up and said mom i just met a 
genius comden told the audience thursday and you know i was 
right 
in on the town i sang this many times this time its 
between lenny and me ok asked nancy walker before she barreled 
through i can cook too a number she first performed on 
broadway in 1944 
bernstein who died on oct 14 at age 72 also was lauded at the 
majestic theater by his son alexander he called his father a 
triplethreat man of the musical theater an enthusiastic amateur 
actor singer and dancer who made up in flamboyance what he lacked 
in skill 
director arthur laurents who served as master of ceremonies for 
the program talked about the paradoxes of bernsteins career in 
which he wanted more recognition from the world of classical music 
than of musical theater 
while he was truly a democratic man musically he was an 
elitist said laurents to him the holy word the desired 
word was opera musical theater was lowercase secondbest 
actor michael wager the composers best friend spoke movingly 
of bernsteins last days when the composer was in a great deal of 
pain but worried about being a burden to his friends and family 
among the other performers were carol lawrence the original 
maria in west side story who sang i feel pretty and 
tonight barbara cook who sang a section of bernsteins 
mass phyllis newman and lauren bacall who did the duet 
ohio from wonderful town and marilyn horne who sang what 
laurents said was bernsteins bestknown song somewhere from 
west side story 
throughout the proceedings a photograph of bernstein peered 
down from high above the stage it showed a beaming bernstein 
skipping out of the national theater in washington after the 
premiere of west side story 33 years ago after the memorial 
the audience stood cheered and applauded the photo

the united states should retreat from its 
demand for deep farm subsidy cuts provided the european community 
makes at least some concessions in the quest for an international 
agreement on agricultural trade a team of analysts said thursday 
john a schnittker a washingtonbased consultant said the 
breakup in brussels last week of the fouryearold uruguay round of 
negotiations put the talks about where we expected with little 
prospect of a deal unless the two sides back off in their bitter 
dispute over farm subsidies 
some believe the talks will resume after some weeks of cooling 
off possibly next month in geneva 
as it stood when the talks were suspended the united states and 
the cairns group of nations which includes australia argentina 
uruguay and others wanted cuts of 75 percent in internal price 
supports and market barriers and 90 percent reductions in export 
subsidies over a 10year period 
the european community refused saying such cuts would force 
more than 20 percent of its 10 million farmers from the land 
schnittker and economist william h meyers of iowa state 
university commented on a report they and dermot hays another iowa 
state economist had written for a professional journal in which 
they argued the united states would be served by lowering its 
sights on the subsidy issue 
the article in choices published by the american agricultural 
economics association contended that political flexibility in 
the ec is very limited and that it might be best to settle for 
whatever new offer provided there is real movement the bloc is 
likely to make 
it is more important in our view to bind the maximum 
concessions the ec is willing to make by the end of february 
assuming they will go somewhat beyond their standing offer than 
it is to ensure deep subsidy and tariff reductions schnittker 
said 
if not he added failure of the talks would leave the us 
cutting farm subsidies unilaterally while we cannot be sure that 
europe and japan will be forced by internal pressures to follow 
suit 
further he said substantial trade gains would accrue to the 
us and cairns group countries from a deal only slightly beyond 
present ec offers 
members of the ec include belgium denmark france germany 
greece ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands britain spain 
and portugal

a final evacuation flight landed in germany thursday carrying 
the us ambassador to kuwait and his staff who survived a 110day 
iraqi siege of their embassy by living on tuna fish and swimming 
pool water 
the five us diplomats from kuwait were among 32 americans on 
the iraqi airways flight from baghdad to germany the state 
department said 
ambassador nathaniel howell looking thinner from the ordeal and 
his gray hair longer told reporters on arrival in frankfurt that 
his staff left the embassy with the flag flying 
were very happy to be here were delighted that americans 
who wanted to leave did he said 
asked if the embassy staff had endured as reported a diet of 
tuna sandwiches howell deadpanned no the bread ran out 
the 50yearold diplomat declined to speak at length explaining 
that we havent had electriciy and water hot water at night for 
110 days so were going to take advantage of that 
the passengers were booked into a luxury hotel near the airport 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said they would fly 
to andrews air force base outside washington on friday afternoon 
the americans included 23 private us citizens the fivemember 
kuwaiti mission staff and four us officials who joined the flight 
in baghdad ms tutwiler said in washington they were among 96 
foreigners aboard she said 
while iraq was allowing the completion of a blanket hostage 
release announced one week ago it accused washington of lying 
about a schedule for usiraq talks it denied us reports that 
washington had offered 15 possible dates for secretary of state 
james a baker iiis trip to baghdad all of which had been 
rejected 
saddam hussein said thursday that iraq wants peace but would 
fight rather than permit foreign domination of arab lands and oil 
we would win and would walk over their corpses and tread on 
their heads the official iraqi news agency quoted him as saying 
the iraqi president has made similar statements in the past 
howell his deputy chief of mission barbara bodine and three 
other american diplomats in kuwait left their embassy early 
thursday and flew to baghdad and then frankfurt aboard a 
uschartered iraqi airways plane 
a us embassy official in baghdad said the compound in kuwait 
was left unstaffed but open and that iraqi authorities had pledged 
it would not be disturbed 
the departure of the american diplomats ended a fourmonth 
diplomatic standoff between the united states and iraq washington 
had defied iraqi orders to close the mission in august 
gradually all foreigners but the british and americans removed 
their diplomats as iraq cut off supplies and posted soldiers 
outside the compounds the trapped us diplomats subsisted for 
three months on canned tuna and boiled water from the embassys 
swimming pool but were allowed emergency supplies in recent weeks 
howells determination before the iraqi troops made him a hero 
to the people he protected 
hes a hero like john wayne said jack rinehart of stover 
mo who was one of those trapped in the embassy before his 
release he drak the same dirty water he slept outside with the 
flies and the heat 
the flight was the final us charter evacuating hostages and 
was said to be the last chartered by any country officials in 
baghdad said all foreigners who missed the charter could leave 
later by regular flights or by ground transportation 
last week iraq announced it would free thousands of foreigners 
it had detained after its aug 2 invasion of kuwait hundreds of 
them mostly americans britons and japanese were held at 
strategic sites to deter a feared attack by usled forces 
us officials said just one former american human shield 
remained behind he was identified as gary oconner of humble 
texas officials said he would go to basra iraq to finalize his 
business and leave iraq at a later date 
before thursdays flight about 188 americans had been evacuated 
from iraq and kuwait over the last week seventy of those had been 
in hiding 86 men were held as human shields and 32 private 
citizens had taken refuge in us diplomatic compounds us 
officials estimate about 500 americans most of them children with 
dual citizenship remained behind 
also thursday iraqs news agency said iraq had rejected dates 
proposed by the united states for foreign minister tariq azizs 
trip to washington and bakers trip to baghdad 
the agency quoting a foreign ministry statement accused 
washington of spreading untrue reports about the fixing of the 
dates 
the state department says iraqs proposed jan 12 date for 
bakers visit is too close to the jan 15 deadline the united 
nations has set for iraq to relinquish kuwait or face possible 
attack 
washington said aziz was scheduled to meet president bush on 
monday but that the meeting will not take place unless a date has 
been set for bakers visit 
in another development a federal judge in washington on 
thursday refused to order bush to seek permission from congress 
before any attack on iraqi forces but reaffirmed the power of 
lawmakers to declare war us district judge harold greene denied 
a request by 54 democratic members of congress for an injunction to 
force the president to seek a declaration of war before launching 
an attack in the gulf

the nations largest catfish processor 
accused of a plantation management philosophy agreed on a 
tentative contract with workers to end a sometimes violent strike 
delta pride catfish inc and the united food and commercial 
workers local 1529 reached the agreement wednesday following two 
days of intensive negotiations federal mediator e dale cline said 
thursday 
if approved the contract would end a 13week strike by a mostly 
black work force that had placed the issue of working conditions on 
an equal footing with pay besides wages the common complaint 
among workers was repetitive motion injury 
workers also complained that they were timed with a stopwatch 
when skinning gutting slicing and packaging fish they also 
complained of limited restroom breaks laborers were allowed six 
fiveminute bathroom breaks per week violators risked dismissal 
details of the agreement will not be disclosed until after union 
ratification cline said 
a ratification vote is scheduled for friday 
union spokesman neel lattimore declined to speculate on the 
outcome of fridays vote but said a bargaining committee 
overwhelmingly approved the pact 
union members said the contract protects the jobs of the 
striking workers 
scattered violence marked the dispute early in the strike but 
the walkout had been peaceful in recent weeks 
the workers plight in one of the countrys most economically 
depressed regions attracted support from the national association 
for the advancement of colored people and other civil rights 
organizations and led to a national boycott of delta pride 
products 
the national attention from the strike prompted state 
agriculture commissioner jim buck ross and others to warn that the 
states catfish industry in jeopardy 
we are pleased to put all of this behind us said larry 
joiner delta pride president and chief executive officer we did 
some hard bargaining and believe we came up with a fair and 
equitable settlement 
joiner said he hoped ratification would end the national 
boycott several grocery chains had refused to buy the catfish 
which are raised on farm ponds across the mississippi delta 
about 900 of the unions 1200 members walked out of delta 
prides indianola and inverness plants sept 13 after rejecting a 
proposed contract most of the strikers are black women workers 
remained on the job at two other plants 
aaron henry president of the mississippi naacp said the 
workers anger stemmed from a combination of race and economics 
coupled with the philosophy of the plantation 
before the strike the average wage at delta pride was 405 an 
hour which for a fulltime job amounts to 8424 a year 
probationary employees start at minimum wage 
delta pride had offered average raises of 48 percent during the 
first year of the threeyear contract and raises ranging from 35 to 
90 cents per hour the next two years but it was rejected 
in october the company reported that it hired more than 500 
replacement workers

women and blacks who bargain for a new ca are 
given higher final prices than white men according to a study 
surveying hundreds of car dealerships 
black woman were offered the highest prices averaging 875 per 
care more than white men the study found 
ian ayres a northwestern university law professor who headed 
the research said thursday the study results may be attributable 
to car dealers trying to concentrate profits by targeting a 
relatively few customers suckers who will pay higher 
markups 
that may not be bigotry but its definitely discrimination 
ayres said 
treating black people differently in order to increase your 
revenues runs afoul of our traditional civil rights norms ayres 
said 
an official with the national automobile dealers association 
denied that any responsible salesman would target a person by race 
or sex especially since most people go to several different 
dealers and play one off another while shopping and while he 
hadnt seen the study nada vice president frank mccarthy said the 
premise was not valid 
the study began three years ago and involved 90 chicagoarea 
dealerships a followup survey of between 275 to 300 dealerships 
was conducted during the past year 
in the first study three white male researchers divided among 
themselves dealerships selling the same brand of domestic car then 
tried to get the best deal on a new car 
each dealership also was visited at about the same time by one 
of three other researchers a white woman a black woman and a 
black man who bargained over the same car the researchers were 
prepared with carefully rehearsed negotiating tactics to get the 
best deal 
the make and model of the car was not disclosed but researchers 
estimated the dealers cost at about 11000 
the study found that white men received final offers that 
averaged about 11362 on a new car with a sticker price of 
13465 
the white woman was given an average final price of 11504 the 
black man an average final price of 11783 and the black woman an 
average price of 12237 no cars were actually purchased 
ayres said that researchers were given the worst deals by 
salespeople of the same race and gender 
the more comprehensive followup study involved 36 testers and 
visits to between 275300 area dealerships domestic and foreign 
each time a white male bargained and either a black man or woman or 
white woman bargained on the same car 
that study yielded similar results except that black men were 
given slightly higher final prices than black women ayres said 
ayres is still analyzing both studies the first of which is the 
subject of an article to appear in the february issue of the 
harvard law review 
but he said the surveys indicate dealers may assume that blacks 
and women are less knowledgeable about cars and the bargaining 
process than white males and therefore more willing to accept a 
higher price ayres said a survey of consumers last spring by the 
consumer federation of america indicated blacks were less likely 
than whites to know they could bargain over the price of a new car 
its not discrimination if car dealers get a higher price from 
someone who cant bargain effectively said david wellman a 
research sociologist at the institute for the study of social 
change at the university of california berkeley 
but it is discrimination if the woman and the blacks cant get 
the car below a given price and a white man can wellman said 
if the data show that the price thats quoted to black women 
is consistently 800 over what white men were quoted the color of 
their skin and their gender must be the reason said wellman who 
wrote the book portraits of white racism 10 years ago

federal researchers said thursday they were 
encouraged with the progress of a 4yearold girl with an immune 
system disease who was the first person to undergo gene therapy 
but they cautioned that the results were too preliminary to make 
any significant conclusions 
the patient is doing very well said r michael blaese an 
immunology expert at the national cancer institute the 
preliminary data is encouraging theres nothing thats 
happened thats made me unhappy 
dr w french anderson of the national heart lung and blood 
institute said they were cautiously optimistic 
they said however that the girl has been on the therapy only 
since september and wont be completely evaluated until after she 
has had three more treatments which she comes in for monthly 
blaese said he expects to begin gene therapy in january on a 
second patient with the same disease a rare genetic condition 
called ada deficiency which deprives the patient of an immune 
system he declined to identify the patient and also has declined 
to identify the first patient citing the parents wish for 
privacy 
blaese and dr w french anderson of the national heart lung 
and blood institute briefed a food and drug administration advisory 
panel on the status of the ada experiment and another gene therapy 
experiment that will involve patients with malignant melanoma a 
lethal form of skin cancer 
the 4yearold girl was born with a defective gene that does not 
produce an enzyme called adenosine deaminase or ada without this 
enzyme her immune system does not function and leaves her with no 
protection against infections 
along with gene therapy she has continued receiving an enzyme 
replacement therapy with weekly injections of a drug called 
pegada which decreases the severity of infections but does not 
fully restore an immune system 
the genetherapy treatments involve inserting normal 
adaproducing genes into cells that are then infused into the 
patients blood where scientists hope they will produce more cells 
with the normal adaproducing gene 
one hopeful sign is that her tcell count the number of these 
immune system cells in her blood are in the normal range for the 
first time in her life blaese said 
also other tests show that the corrected cells are surviving 
and that the new gene is working producing ada 
scientists hope that as we progress down the road with this

president bush on thursday urged the passage 
of state laws to protect publicservice volunteers from personal 
liability in lawsuits arising from their efforts 
explaining the rationale for the measures attorney general dick 
thornburgh cited a case in which a little league baseball coach was 
sued after he shifted a youth from shortstop to the outfield and 
the youngster was subsequently injured 
the parents said their son was a born shortstop and should 
not have been moved thornburgh said adding that the coach was 
held legally liable for the injury 
bush addressing a gathering of volunteer leaders said 
im determined to help remove barriers to public service no 
obstacle no obstacle is more chilling than the fear of personal 
liability and the high cost of insurance to protect against 
liability 
bush urged enactment of model state legislation protecting 
volunteers while providing a reasonable basis for the recovery of 
damages which may arise from volunteer activity 
he also urged creation of a private national volunteer risk 
management center where organizations could turn for advice and 
assistance

the latest design proposal for the 149 
million korean war veterans memorial illustrates the reality of 
actual war by depicting soldiers under fire the architects told 
a federal commission thursday 
in a stormy twohour meeting the commission on fine arts heard 
representatives of the cooperlecky architectural firm argue for 
the battle scene rather than the less explicit prizewinning design 
submitted earlier by four pennsylvania state university architects 
w kent cooper noted the firms design would show some hostile 
action involving a column of 38 soldiers including air force 
observers looking to call in an air strike 
the design would confront visitors with the reality of actual 
war said sculptor frank gaylord who is working with 
cooperlecky on the project 
critics have said the design glorifies war the commission 
along with several other groups must decide whether to accept the 
plan or choose instead the rival design submitted by the penn 
state group last year it could also request a combination of the 
two 
the university architects attended thursdays meeting with their 
attorney robert sokolove they won a 20000 contest last year to 
design the memorial across the reflecting pool from the vietnam 
veterans memorial the entry was declared the winner by a jury of 
korean war veterans 
the penn state design called for a dreamlike collection of 
soldiers moving some unevenly across a remote landscape toward an 
american flag 
problems began after the design was unveiled at a white house 
ceremony on june 14 1989 
the original architects said the plan was for the government to 
retain a second firm to implement the original prizewinning 
idea what happened sokolove said recently is that cooperlecky 
submitted its own design amounting to a gi joe battle scene 
this was not a concept competition this was a design 
competition sokolove told the commission we have a jury 
system in this country a jury has spoken in this case once 
sokolove said the group would consider a lawsuit if its design was 
turned down 
but retired army gen richard stilwell said in a statement that 
the original architects relinquished all rights to their 
submission in consideration of substantial prize money 
stillwell heads a board created by congress to oversee the 
project he said the new design retains the essential element of 
the old one a column advancing toward an american flag 
the advisory board said the changes including structural ones 
so the memorial can accommodate large crowds were based on 
suggestions by the commission of fine arts and the national capitol 
planning commission both commissions must still approve the final 
plan 
you hate to see this kind of dispute between two talented 
teams of designers fine arts commissioner robert peck said 
some 57 million americans served in korea during the 195053 
conflict and more than 54000 were killed

the federal communications commission on 
thursday began implementing a law designed to crack down on a new 
breed of companies that provide longdistance telephone service to 
the traveling public 
the commission in a 50 vote approved rules to comply with the 
telephone operator consumer services improvement act of 1990 which 
president bush signed oct 17 
the law deals with socalled alternative operator service 
companies that handle dialo calls such as collect 
persontoperson and charge card calls made by travelers these 
companies which sprouted in the wake of the 1984 breakup of 
american telephone amp telegraph co lease phone lines from 
longdistance carriers such as atampt mci and us sprint 
the new companies have been the subject of thousands of 
complaints to the fcc for excessively high charges 
as of jan 15 these companies will have to 
clearly identify themselves to customers twice once when the 
operator answers and again before the call is connected 
provide information on rates and the fcc complaint process 
not bill for unanswered calls 
not engage in call splashing the practice of a company 
unable to complete a call switching it to an operator in a distant 
city in such a case the caller gets a bill from a place he or she 
never visited 
provide a schedule ofprices to the fcc 
hotels schools and others using alternate operator service 
companies also must post specific information on or near their 
phones and not block access to other longdistance companies by 
means of 950 or 800 numbers 
the new rules were to have become effective in midnovember but 
the companies affected persuaded congress after it passed the law 
that they needed more time to comply 
also on thursday the commission initiated investigations 
designed to monitor the operator services industry and to consider 
whether pay phone owners should be compensated for customers who 
use tollfree access numbers to reach their longdistance carriers 
the commission also will address the issue of 10xxx access 
numbers atampt customers for example when traveling may reach 
atampt by first dialing 10288 by mid1992 all new nonresidential 
phone equipment must be able to reach the 10xxx access numbers 
the american public communications council of the north american 
telecommunications association has suggested to the fcc that pay 
phone owners receive 25 cents for each access call 
atampt has lobbied the fcc for 10xxx access saying it would cost 
it as much as 50 million to develop and 250 million a year to 
operate an 800 access number atampt also argues that 10xxx access 
offers better sound quality and service than 800 or 950 numbers 
but hotels and similar users complain it would cost thousands of 
dollars to upgrade existing switchboards to handle 10xxx calls

as world war ii neared its end the last 47 
jews in chelmno concentration camp wrote a collective will 
they had nothing to bequeath but love for their families and 
the hope of being posthumously avenged ten days later when the 
soviet army arrived all but two of the prisoners had been shot 
the colective will lay in a soviet archive for 45 years until 
an israeli historian discovered it this week among a delivery of 
thousands of documents from moscow 
armed soldiers stand around us what can i do please tell my 
brothers yitzhak lazer and mordechai motek and my sister hava in 
moscow of my fate i have another sister regina in america 
please tell them my last wish before i die to avenge my death 
and the death of all the many jews who were murdered like 
animals wrote 16yearold berek himelfarb 
berek was among the last to die of the more than 300000 jews 
murdered by the nazis at chelmno in westcentral poland 
shmuel krakowski chief archivist of the yad vashem holocaust 
memorial said the will is their victory over the germans 
they were bound with shackles and it was the only thing they 
could do to see that the world knows about the nazis 
crimes he said 
the will signed by 10 of the prisoners was written on january 
9 1944 eight days before they were murdered the 7th division of 
the 1st byelorussian front liberated the camp three days later on 
january 20 
one of the polish peasants found it we dont know how and he 
gave it to the first russian soldiers he met when they entered the 
camp krakowski said 
in a telephone interview thursday krakowski said he found the 
will among thousands of pages of material brought to israel by ilya 
altman of the central state archives in moscow as part of an 
agreement with yad vashm 
the will had been translated from polish into russian 
it opens by saying it is being written in the name of the last 
47 prisoners at the camp 
attention the fortunate person who discovers these papers 
please read them diligently and tell it to everyone and our 
relatives who have remained alive it says 
it describes the machinery of extermination at the camp and 
then presents individual testaments from prisoners who apparently 
came from nearby lodz 
our hearts are hardened with the us and british governments 
they could have if they wanted stopped most of the german 
massacres and prevented the murder of hundreds of thousands of 
jews in this terrible death i must end because my eyes are burning 
with tears and i must lie down on the floor i beg you fortunate 
people you must avenge us and our families wrote yitzhak 
zydelman 
berek himelfarb wrote when i see how they murder thousands of 
innocent jews my heart is torn i am only 16 and they have put 
shackles on my feet like a criminal 
two of the 47 escaped including tavek srebrink who testified at 
the trial of nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in jerusalem 
eichmann was hanged in 1962 
the will also lists the names of the german officers and 
soldiers in the camp twelve chelmno ss men were sentenced in a 
trial in bonn in 1963 to one to 20 years imprisonment

an opposition rally to protest alleged vote 
fraud turned into a bloody clash with riot police that killed three 
people and injured up to 50 in the small town of tejupilco in 
mexico state officials said thursday 
mexico city newspapers ran pictures of police clubbing fleeing 
women armed peasants charging city hall burning cars and sprawled 
bodies state government spokesman cesar silva said fighting raged 
for hours wednesday 
the melee in the town of about 7000 people 80 miles southwest 
of the capital brought to a boil mexicos long conflict over clean 
elections 
state officials accused herberto castillo a founder of the 
opposition centerleft democratic revolutionary party prd and 
other local prd leaders of masterminding the city hall takeover and 
threatened prosecution castillo denied he instigated violence 
state officials said two police officers and one civilian were 
killed and 40 to 50 people injured four people were arrested on 
arms charges 
the prd says mexicos governing institutional revolutionary 
party or pri cheated in nov 11 state and local elections 
throughout mexico prd activists believe their party was robbed in 
the tejupilco mayoral race and have held a sitin at a plaza 
outside city hall since the election 
wednesdays riot started about 3 pm after a confrontation 
between riot police guarding city hall and a group of women 
attending a prd rally 
what provoked the confrontation was unclear but prd and state 
officials agree that caos broke out when police lobbed tear gas 
grenades into the packed town square and shots rang out 
from where i was on the speakers platform i could see riot 
police clubbing the women within seconds they began firing tear 
gas grenades people started running but police blocked every exit 
from the plaza said castillo 
townspeople charged city hall battled police with bricks 
boards and guns and destroyed six police cars silva said 
he and castillo spoke in telephone interviews thursday 
silva said about 80 riot police were on guard outside city hall 
and about 200 were inside he said they carried no firearms 
but castillo said he saw officers grab guns from patrol cars as 
the battle flared and police reinforcements poured into town 
silva said state officials had sent police to tejupilco because 
of rumors the prd would try to take over city hall the day of the 
rally 
castillo said state officials planned and provoked the 
violence to create an image of violence for his party 
he did not deny some people came to the rally armed or may have 
had automatic weapons 
this is a hot area with a lot of guns and a lot of drug 
trafficking he said its not impossible that people had these 
kinds of arms 
castillo insisted however that the protesters were provoked by 
a police attack on innocent unarmed women 
silva said the prd started the fight 
what began as a peaceful meeting degenerated into violence 
when one speaker told the women to take over city hall he said 
he conceded that police may have reacted strongly to what was 
probably verbal aggression at the outset 
prd supporters in neighboring michoacan and guerrero states have 
taken over several city halls complaining of vote fraud since 
1988 when a prd founder cuauhtemoc cardenas lost the 
presidential race to carlos salinas de gortari 
the pri has been in power in mexico since 1929 
official results in the tejupilco race gave the pri candidate 
6700 votes and the prd candidate 3599 this adds up to over 
10000 votes more than the population of tejupilco castillo 
said

the air force said thursday it is sending more 
warplanes to saudi arabia from germany and britain the navy 
announced the activation of hundreds of reservists for medical duty 
in the persian gulf 
also the pentagon said defense secretary dick cheney and gen 
colin l powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff will travel 
to saudi arabia next week to visit american troops and to meet with 
saudi government officials 
cheney and powell will leave washington tuesday and return dec 
23 
the air force announcement is the latest in a string of 
deployments designed to give the united states a stronger offensive 
air capability in the event president bush orders us forces into 
combat against iraq 
the air force said it is dispatching an undisclosed number of 
f16 fighter jets and their crews to the middle east from the 50th 
tactical fighter wing hahn air base in germany starting jan 8 a 
wing normally includes about 70 aircraft 
also preparing for deployment to the gulf area are elements of 
the 10th tactical fighter wing from royal air force station 
alconbury in britain the wing will send an undisclosed number of 
a10 warthog antiarmor aircraft starting jan 23 
squadrons of f16s and a10s deployed to the gulf in august with 
the first wave of us forces along with dozens of other air 
force army and marine corps aircraft 
the air force deployments are part of a broad buildup of us 
reinforcements in the gulf area officials have declined to provide 
details on numbers of planes and aviators being sent but it is 
believed that at least 300 additional air force planes are headed 
to the gulf along with at least 10000 personnel 
in a related development the army said it put 1400 army 
reserve members from 10 states on active duty for desert shield 
most are specialists in personnel processing 
in its announcement the navy said it was ordering to active 
duty 2388 reservists from 94 navy reserve units in 24 states 
mostly to provide medical support 
thousands more medical specialists are needed for desert shield 
because of bushs decision in early november to send up to 200000 
soldiers sailors marines and airmen to the gulf as 
reinforcements by january the us force arrayed against iraq is 
expected to number as many as 430000 personnel 
pete williams a pentagon spokesman said the deployment of 
additional medical personnel and supplies is on schedule and will 
continue according to a logistics plan that tries to match field 
medical services with projected combat casualties 
defense officials have declined to make public the pentagons 
estimates of casualties in the event of war against iraq williams 
said information about the number of hospital beds and other 
medical supplies also is highly classified 
that gives a glimpse into where and what you expect to 
happen if the crisis turns to war and that could give an 
indication of future operational expectations williams said in 
explaining why medical plans are secret 
the spokesman said the most he could reveal is the types of 
hospital units being deployed to the gulf he named air force 
airtransportable hospitals with 50 beds each army mash units 
with 60 beds each evacuation hospitals with 400 beds apiece 
combat support hospitals with 200 beds each field hospitals with 
400 beds each and navy hospital ships with 1000 beds apiece 
williams also said that some private hospitals in the united 
states have been alerted that the pentagon may need some of their 
beds in the event of a gulf war he gave no details but said 
defense department and veterans administration hospitals would be 
used before civilian hospitals

farmers arent dancing in their fields in 
reaction to president bush easing trade restrictions on the soviet 
union and granting 1 billion in federal credit to buy us 
agricultural products 
words of praise for the move announced wednesday were tempered 
with criticism thursday 
my first reaction is too little too late said milton 
giedinghagen a stafford wheat farmer who heads the kansas 
association of wheat growers i hope it does people over there 
some good 
as the nations no 1 wheatproducing and flourmilling state 
kansas has a significant stake in the agricultural export trade 
from twothirds to threefourths of the hard red winter wheat 
raised in the state is exported 
giedinghagen noted that prices for cash wheat dipped nearly 4 
cents thursday because the grain markets had expected the 
governments credit package to be bigger 
in the immediate term it will cast a cloud over prices if 
were not able to grant credit in any larger quantity than 
announced yesterday the soviet union wont have the ability to 
take its full component of exports projections in the longterm 
grain agreement said jim mckinstray manager of a large grain 
elevator in champaign county ill 
the soviet union repeatedly has said it needs 3 billion in 
credit to meet its agricultural import needs 
this would have been a more welcome occurrence the credits 
had the administration moved forward aggressively and extended 
these credits last summer when producers were asking for them 
said chris rink director of the oklahoma wheat commission 
weve already lost competition in the european community and 
canada especially those nations extended several billions of 
dollars of credits to the soviet union within the last few months 
and have already made substantial sales of wheat rink said 
although it should have happened months ago the action at least 
puts the united states back in the marketplace said dean kleckner 
a rudd iowa farmer who heads the american farm bureau federation 
the nations largest farm group the group represents nearly 4 
million farm families 
its not going to be the great shot in the arm that some 
american farmers expected kleckner said 
don hutchens of the nebraska corn board also criticized the 1 
billion limit 
that is not enough in our understanding of what the soviets 
need and its not enough to get us up to the level of what we were 
previously selling to the soviet union hutchens said 
last year at this time 6 million metric tons of corn had been 
sold to the soviet union he said so far this year sales total 
420000 tons he said 
analysts said the soybean and corn markets also showed 
disappointment at the size of the package soybeans dropped 10 
cents to 12 cents and corn about 3 to 4 cents 
but soybean and corn prices should respond favorably to the 
news said jim nichols minnesota agriculture commissioner 
wheat producers fear the soviets might concentrate on soybean 
meal and corn because of their need for highprotein livestock feed 
and their earlier wheat purchases from other exporting countries 
on the bright side some said the announcement bodes well for 
the future 
this sends a strong message to the people of the united states 
that the bush administration is going to push for trade with the 
soviets and help them become valid trading partners said rick 
perry texas agriculture commissionerelect 
don ethridge a texas tech university agricultural economist 
said the anticipated grain sales will help work off surpluses and 
depending on what is bought eventually increase market prices 
but he issued a warning 
in the long term we cant continue to sell them grain on 
credit he said they will eventually wind up with a heavier 
debt load than they can stand

president bush welcoming former persian gulf 
hostages to the white house on thursday sharply rejected any 
suggestion that iraqs saddam hussein should get a reward for 
letting them go 
hell no not one thing bush said you dont reward a 
kidnapper you dont reward somebody who has done something he 
shouldnt have done in the first place 
asked if he expected to be able to defuse the tensions in the 
persian gulf bush snapped one way or another we will 
the president met with seven newly released hostages as 32 of 
their countrymen left the persian gulf on what could be the last 
charter out he said stories told by returning hostages have 
demonstrated the brutality of saddams actions 
what this man put the world through i just cant express it 
and i think you all expressed it coming home with a clarity that 
has brought this home to the american people bush said 
he said after the hourlong meeting it was a very moving 
experience a lot of people who showed a lot of support for what 
were doing 
the hostages included one man who hid within the us embassy 
compound in kuwait four who had been used as human shields at 
sensitive iraqi installations and two who had been in hiding in 
kuwait 
also on thursday in washington 
defense secretary dick cheney stressed that saddams release 
of the hostages brought with it no indication the iraqi president 
would pull his troops out of occupied kuwait 
cheney said saddam continues to deploy more forces to kuwait 
and southern iraq every indication is he intends to continue his 
illegal occupation of kuwait cheney made his comments to 
reporters after speaking at the national war college 
us district judge harold greene denied a request by 54 
democratic members of congress for an injunction to force the 
president to seek a declaration of war before launching an attack 
on iraqi troops in kuwait 
the judge said the constitution requires a president to gain 
such authorization before launching an actual attack but he said 
the case was premature since a majority of congress had not 
expressed a view on a possible attack and because bush has not 
shown a commitment to a definitive course of action 
the air force said it is sending more us warplanes to saudi 
arabia from germany and britain and the navy announced the 
activation of hundreds of reservists for medical duty in the gulf 
area 
also the pentagon said cheney and gen colin l powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff will travel to saudi arabia 
next tuesday to visit american troops and to meet with saudi 
government officials 
two former hostages spoke with reporters after the meeting with 
bush and said the group supported his handling of the gulf 
situation 
to a man we were in agreement with the care and the diligence 
which is being taken by the president said ralph montgomery 56 
montgomery an architect from indian rocks beach fla said he 
hid with his soninlaw who was a teacher at the american school 
in kuwait he praised their palestinian neighbors for protecting 
them 
antonio mireles who had stayed at the embassy compound said 
the hostages told bush the kuwaitis are a peaceloving people and 
what has happened here cannot be left unattended 
it was atrocious what occurred here said mireles 48 who 
had been working a civil engineer for the kuwaiti government 
the last planned ussponsored flight from iraq arrived in 
frankfurt germany carrying 94 passengers those on board included 
the last five us diplomats from the us embassy in kuwait 
ambassador nathaniel howell and other american diplomats had 
defied iraqs order to shut down the embassy in august cut off 
from most supplies and with their compound surrounded by iraqi 
soldiers the embassy staff subsisted mainly on canned tuna and 
boiled water from their swimming pool 
the besieged diplomats departed only after they were satisfied 
that all americans had been given a chance to leave the country 
us officials said 
thursdays flight was expected to be the final chartered plane 
carrying foreigners from iraq and kuwait an estimated 500 
americans many of them children with dual citizenship were 
remaining in kuwait or iraq 
if any of the remaining americans later decide they want to 
leave they can fly out by a commercial iraqi airliner according 
to the state department 
on capitol hill thursday former us military officials joined 
private defense specialists in telling the house armed services 
committee that an american air attack would lessen casualties at 
the start of a war against iraq 
the officials and experts held out little hope for economic 
sanctions succeeding against iraqi president saddam hussein 
unlike his senate counterpart sam nunn dga chairman of the 
senate armed services committee rep les aspin dwis who heads 
the house panel shares the bush administrations doubts about the 
effectiveness of sanctions 
the witnesses selected by aspin favored the use of military 
force to oust iraq from kuwait contending that sanctions will not 
succeed aspin indicated his hopes that exploring the possibility 
of attacking will help congress make a decision about war 
to be united on our goals in the gulf but divided on means 
would spell disaster aspin said 
retired army col trevor dupuy said if we wait for sanctions 
to succeed saddam knows were waiting and he will outlast us 
eliot cohen of johns hopkins university school of advanced 
international studies said failing to go to war would persuade 
saddam that it would be even easier the next time if he has 
nuclear weapons

soon bostonians may be able to ride horses at top 
speed without risking a 20 fine sell certain vegetables without 
peeling them first and take more than a halfpint of sea worms from 
boston harbor with impunity 
equine speed limits and similarly outdated ordinances have 
remained on the books in boston despite the passage of time now a 
city council committee has selected some they want to lay to rest 
many of them are essential laws from the 17th century 
councilor brian j mclaughlin said thursday hes behind the legal 
housecleaning effort unfortunately theyre not essential laws 
from this century 
for instance according to section 27 of chapter 16 of the city 
code riders of horses that trot faster than 7 mph through city 
streets are subject to a 20 speeding ticket others outlaw grazing 
and cattle driving through the streets of boston punishable by a 
10 fine 
mclaughlin said the antiquated laws are found in the city of 
boston code ordinance chapter xvi prohibitions penalties and 
permits its a grab bag of ordinances some of which duplicate 
state law 
mclaughlin heads the council committee on government operations 
which targeted some 50 ordinances about half of them laughable 
anachronisms the panel has recommended repealing changing or 
recoding them its now up to the city council to vote on the 
recommendations no date for a vote has been set 
mcglaughlin said its possible some people may raise objections 
but he doesnt anticipate many protests 
mclaughlin joked though that hes had second thoughts about 
one venerable prohibition slated for repeal 
one has to do with fish excess which is basically entrails 
he said theres a prohibition here from throwing them into the 
boston harbor 
actually that one may make sense because of all the pollution 
problems weve had maybe well have to keep that one

housing secretary jack kemp announced friday a 
national plan to eradicate lead poisoning in millions of us homes 
in which children are exposed to peeling leadbased paint or high 
levels of lead in house dust 
the plan includes a new financial assistance program and is 
tailored to help lowerincome families with children the 
department of housing and urban development said in a statement 
the department said the proposed cost and other details of the 
financial aid plan will be disclosed as part of the federal budget 
for the 1992 fiscal year that begins oct 1 1991 
we must ensure that lowincome families with children have 
access to public information and financial assistance to help them 
protect their children from the hazards posed by leadbased 
paint kemp said 
the department said that in developing the plan it conducted a 
national study which found that young children are present in about 
38 million us homes which have peeling leadbased paint or lead 
in dust 
about half of the households involved are considered lower 
income the department said 
it said the plan involves either the removal of leadbased paint 
or covering it over so it is no longer a threat to health 
the plan to eliminate the hazard in private housing complements 
huds ongoing efforts to do so in public housing the department 
statement said 
lead poisoning can lead to mental retardation and other mental 
disorders it also can damage the liver and lead to paralysis of 
the extremities sometimes followed by convulsion and collapse its 
effects are permanent and cannot be reversed 
hud said other elements of the plan include proposals to 
expand public education efforts to help explain the dangers of 
lead and how children can be protected from it 
support state and local programs to increase the number of 
young children checked for lead in blood 
conduct new research to reduce the cost and measure the health 
benefits of removing exposure to lead 
increase the capability on the part of state and local 
governments and the private sector to test for and eliminate the 
dangers of leadbased paint 
the department noted that at present only two states maryland 
and massachusetts have comprehensive leadbased paint abatement 
programs

a shipment of 35 million sterilized screwworm 
flies will be sent to libya this weekend in the kickoff of a 
program to eliminate the pest from the north african country the 
agriculture department said thursday 
the sterile worms mate with natural flies but produce no 
offspring thus shortcircuiting the insects reproductive cycle 
the method has proved to be an effective biological control of the 
pests in mexico and the southern united states 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said the flies come from a plant 
in tuxtla gutierrez mexico 
the flies will be sold to the un food and agriculture 
organization at cost he said the fao is sponsoring and paying for 
the screwworm program in libya the effort is expected to take two 
years and eventually require aerial drops of 100 million sterile 
flies a week 
glosser said the sale of the flies to fao culminates more than 
year of negotiations with the un agency and mexico 
we recognize the sensitivity of ventures with libya but we 
also recognize the importance of preventing the spread of 
screwworms from libya glosser said our goal is to help 
protect livestock wildlife and human health in southern europe and 
africa from this devastating pest 
in its natural state the female screwworm fly lays eggs in the 
open wounds of warmblooded animals the developing larvae feed on 
the flesh of the host deepening the wound and attracting other 
egglaying females 
screwworm cases are usually fatal if left untreated and have 
been known to occur in humans glosser said 
the british museum detected screwworms in libya two years ago 
the fao subsequently requested sterile flies from the department 
the libyan program is expected to cost fao about 101 million over 
the two years

president bush has yet to decide what if 
anything to do about a surprise education department ruling that 
reinterprets civil rights law to bar colleges from directing 
scholarships to racial minorities spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
thursday 
a department official declared wednesday it is illegal for 
federally supported institutions to offer racespecific 
scholarships a policy shift that drew immediate fire from 
educators and civil rights leaders 
fitzwater confirmed the white house was not consulted on the 
issue obviously we like to know in advance of decisions that 
have wide repercussions but we didnt he said thats the way 
it happens 
asked if president bush a longtime supporter of the united 
negro college fund would direct the justice department to appeal 
the ruling fitzwater said we dont have an opinion at this 
time we havent had a chance to look at it 
he said bush supports various affirmative action programs but 
opposes racial quotas this is a kind of an inbetween case that 
is not clear exactly what it means 
michael l williams the education departments assistant 
secretary for civil rights said wednesday he had warned officials 
of the fiesta bowl about their offer of 100000 each in minority 
scholarships to the universities of louisville and alabama if their 
football teams play in the game 
he said in a dec 4 letter to bowl officials that title six 
of the 1964 civil rights act prohibits discrimination on the 
ground of race color or national origin in any program or 
activity receiving federal financial assistance 
fiesta bowl officials made the offer after arizona voters 
rejected a holiday honoring the late civil rights leader martin 
luther king jr prompting threatened boycotts of arizona sports 
events by the national football league and universities 
richard rosser president of the national association of 
independent colleges and universities said the ruling puts 
universities in a catch22 situation where federally funded 
programs and private grants for minorities are permitted but 
institutions are not allowed to operate their own programs 
he said his organization has asked for an immediate meeting with 
education department officials and if we cant get it resolved 
at that level we hope to go to the white house 
the office of rep augustus f hawkins dcal chairman of the 
house education and labor committee said hearings on the issue 
will be held next wednesday 
i have a problem with the department threatening something 
that has been in existence for decades said rep william d 
ford dmich a member of the education committee we will be 
taking a closer look at just what the administration has in mind 
and what the implications are 
david r owitz spokesman for the american council on education 
said there is no accurate estimate of how many programs might be 
affected if the ban is imposed but that it could have 
significant impact on efforts by graduate schools to recruit 
more minority students 
if you want to produce minority scientists and mathematicians 
you are going to have to find a way to give them adequate 
funding he said 
to say we are appalled is to understate our position said 
naacp executive director benjamin hooks we are in fact 
incensed at the insensitivity callousness and quite frankly the 
illogic of such a ruling 
williams said his department has been handling complaints about 
raceexclusive scholarships on a casebycase basis but now is 
working to set a policy that will work across the board 
he said race could be considered a positive factor in offering 
scholarships among similarly qualified individuals if the 
institution is one where there has been limited participation of a 
particular race

communist albania on thursday ordered 
soldiers to quell an attack on officials and buildings by 
hooligans armed with knives stones and iron bars that 
countrys official media reported 
the attacks in the northern city of shkodra came one day after a 
peaceful rally by tens of thousands of people in the capital 
tirana celebrating the founding of the countrys first 
noncommunist party the democratic party of albania 
journalists said tirana about 80 miles south of shkodra 
remained calm thursday 
official reports said attackers with knives and iron bars 
assaulted the local police chief and two other policemen in the 
city of shkodra 
official albanian radio monitored by the british broadcasting 
corp in london said gangs were throwing stones at the district 
party and government buildings and committing acts of vandalism 
inside the local radio station 
in order to reimpose order and calm in the city and to defend 
government and social institutions the forces of public order and 
the army came into action it said 
a later ata report said the rioters were without any political 
aims however the attacks suggest that tension in the small 
isolated balkan country was unlikely to die down despite official 
concessions during a week of protests 
albania with the last stalinist government in europe has for 
decades kept a tight lid on protest but allowed limited reforms in 
past months in july thousands of people jammed foreign embassies 
in tirana until they were permitted to emigrate 
a journalist of the official ata news agency contacted by 
telephone in tirana said thursdays reports were read on both the 
official radio and television the journalist spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
such quick reporting is new for albania information especially 
about protests against the government and party authorities has 
been tightly controlled for decades 
it was not clear whether the army was forced to use weapons or 
how many attackers there were there was no immediate indication 
whether the situation was under control late thursday 
the official report said that despite president ramiz alias 
appeal for calm wednesday there were certain dark forces which 
seek to destabilize the situation in the country 
in tirana meanwhile organizers of the countrys first 
noncommunist party were working on a program calling for human 
rights and privatization of the suffering economy 
gramoz pashko a tirana university economist involved with the 
new party said students intellectuals and others hoped to present 
a formal program and statutes within a couple of days 
pashko in a telephone interview from tirana said the new party 
sought to implement human rights as outlined in the helsinki final 
act and subsequent documents and to open up the economy to private 
and foreign investment 
he said the group hoped to present its platform as soon as 
possible to enable authorities to register the new party 
the ruling communist party surprisingly reversed itself tuesday 
and agreed to permit alternative political organizations however 
it has not firmly stated it will relinquish its constitutional 
monopoly on power 
pashko noted that parliament also will have to pass a law on 
registering political parties 
a journalist for the state news agency ata said it was expected 
the new party would be registered quickly because its program is 
very good for the people 
alia warned albanians late wednesday that if they followed 
demagogues the country threatens to be destabilized and cast into 
anarchy 
before tuesday the communists had said they would allow more 
than one person to run for each parliamentary seat but would not 
permit political pluralism the communists also had rejected the 
kind of farreaching changes that led to the fall of communist 
governments in the rest of eastern europe 
the concession tuesday followed three days of student 
antigovernment protests in tirana 
wage increases were promised earlier this year but albanians 
say they have not materialized even the promises afforded only 
temporary respite from the leaders basic dilemma how to make the 
changes needed to get the economy going while retaining control and 
avoiding open rebellion

two researchers who analyzed the chemistry of 
deposits at a proposed nuclear waste dump in nevada said they 
believe the site hasnt been affected by rising ground water for 
more than 300000 years 
thure e cerling a university of utah geologist said the 
findings suggest that yucca mountain in southern nevada would make 
a site where the nations highly radioactive nuclear wastes could 
be deposited without fear of polluting underground waters 
these findings provide no evidence of rising ground water at 
the site cerling said i cant say positively that this would 
never happen but this study certainly provides no evidence for 
such a scenario 
as a result he said yucca mountain looks a lot better than a 
lot of other places as a safe stable place to store radioactive 
nuclear wastes but he cautioned that there is still a lot of 
work to be done before the geology in the area is fully 
understood 
yucca mountain has been chosen by the federal government as the 
primary candidate site for a nuclear waste dump 
among the reasons it was selected is that preliminary studies 
showed it appeared to be unlikely that ground water would flood a 
waste repository installed 450 feet underground in the area 
a series of test trenches have been dug across faults near yucca 
mountain in one of them trench 14 experts found a network of 
carbonate veins a mineral deposit often associated with water 
some experts have said the minerals were deposited during the 
last ice age which ended about 12000 years ago when ground water 
rose to an level that would fill the proposed underground nuclear 
dump 
but cerling and jay quade also of utah say the deposits are 
much much older 
in the current issue of the journal science the researchers 
said the carbonates in trench 14 were deposited thousands of years 
before the last ice age and that ground water has not risen to the 
level of the proposed nuclear repository for more than 300000 
years 
the carbonates cerling said were formed in the soil or by 
soilforming processes the important point is that they would have 
formed in the unsaturated zone which means there is not permanent 
water there 
cerling said that means that the deposit of nuclear wastes at 
the yucca mountain site is less likely to pollute underground 
water 
the deposits in trench 14 he said bear the chemical signature 
of carbonate produced by the local vegetation he said modern soils 
nearby have a similar carbon signature and that other evidence 
shows that vegetation in the area at the time of the trench 14 
deposits was similar to the modern day plants 
when carbonate is created by ground water as some scientists 
suggest for trench 14 the mineral shows the chemical signature of 
limestone cerling said he said his analysis of the yucca mountain 
carbonate shows no signature of limestone 
what this implies is that these particular carbonates have no 
evidence of being associated with rising ground water cerling 
said 
robert loux of the nevada nuclear waste project office said that 
the utah researchers conclusion is highly controversial 
the data has been countered by a number of other 
scientists who suggest that those deposits can only be made by 
uplifting of hydrothermal waters from the subsurface loux said 
there is as much data that suggests it was formed by 
subsurface processes as there is that suggests it formed by 
precipitation processes he said 
cerling conceded that there is a disagreement among scientists 
on the issues and said that more work is needed before there is a 
consensus 
science is the journal of the american association for the 
advancement of science

workers struggled to shore up three homes 
that were sinking deeper into the earth thursday after an abandoned 
coal mine collapsed 
two homes sank 3 feet within hours after homeowners first 
noticed the popping and cracking that heralded the mine subsidence 
wednesday 
there were no injuries but police evacuated six homes overnight 
residents on thursday were allowed to move back into all but two of 
the homes 
kelly caringer and chad smith were practicing music in smiths 
basement when they noticed the noises said caringers father ken 
caringer 
my son said it was like labor pains they got closer and 
closer together and more extreme said caringer who lives a 
block away in the southern illinois town of about 9600 
it was a little like you were in the middle of an earthquake 
but nothing but the house was moving said caringer who helped 
the smiths move their furniture from the home 
the smith home tilted noticeably to one side and had separated 
about 6 inches from its garage 
a second home belonging to jc and carolyn garavalia listed 
backwards markedly 
workers drained about 175000 gallons of water from a water 
tower beside the smith home fearing the tower might collapse said 
bob gibson of the illinois abandoned mined lands reclamation 
council 
water from a main that broke during the collapse flooded the 
back yards of the two homes and poured into part of an 8foot deep 
gash in the ground that ringed the perimeter of the 300foot by 
300foot sag gibson said 
it took workers about 24 hours to stop the leak 
steel beams were installed under the three homes on the edge of 
the sag to prevent cracking as the homes sink further gibson said 
its a mess said resident maxine smith as she and her 
husband kenneth inspected the hairline cracks that snaked along 
the walls and floors of the house 
its terrible it makes me sick to think about it mr smith 
said 
the 100000 homes which are all insured against mine 
subsidence are safe to live in and will be repaired after the 
earth stops moving gibson said 
he estimated that the ground would sink another 4 to 5 inches 
over the next year the mine which runs about 120 feet 
underground was abandoned in 1925 by the franklin county coal co 
one resident who would not give his name or comment remained 
in the third home it sustained only minor cracking but gibson 
predicted that it would sink further and would have been severely 
damaged without the steel supports 
there is no way to predict when a mine will collapse usually it 
is caused when the clay floor or a ceiling support buckles he 
said 
experts dont know what causes the buckling 
we are fighting the unknown here gibson said

we prayed a lot said wayne cox 
the 40yearold cox and his kuwaitiborn wife layla said 
prayer and worry were their major occupations during their four 
months in hiding in kuwait after the iraqi invasion on aug 2 
the coxes and their three young children had moved to kuwait on 
june 15 she to use her masters degree in public health to work 
for the government he to take a job with kuwait television as an 
electronics technician 
the iraqi invasion turned their lives inside out cox never left 
the house a hiding place was prepared within elaborate lies were 
developed about who mrs cox was married to and the children the 
rare times they were let out to play in the yard were not allowed 
to speak english 
on thursday the coxes left the chaos behind and flew to 
frankfurt on the last scheduled evacuation flight of foreigners 
led by us ambassador nathaniel howell and other embassy staff 
in brief comments to reporters howell at first said he had 
closed the embassy but then caught himself saying he did not 
close the embassy but i vacated it the flag flies 
howell looked a bit thinner from the ordeal and his gray hair 
had grown long after retrieving his luggage howell said he had 
lost a little weight on the siege diet which featured canned 
tuna and boiled water from the embassy swimming pool 
asked if the embassy staff had endured as reported on a diet 
of tuna sandwiches howell deadpanned no the bread ran out 
howell declined to speak at length saying we havent had 
electricity and water hot water at night for 110 days so were 
going to take advantage of that 
iraqi officials only began allowing in fresh supplies during the 
final two weeks of the standoff which began shortly after iraq 
invaded kuwait 
its terrible you had to be there everything is trash 
mrs cox said of the occupied emirate she looked nervous and gaunt 
as she collected belongings in frankfurt airport and cared for 
daughter miriam 6 son jassim 7 and cradled 11monthold rachel 
in her arms 
i felt the freedom when i came here and i thought of my 
sisters there because i had said goodbye to them she said 
when i landed here and the hostages shouted in the airplane 
with happiness its not happiness for me she said my poor 
sisters and their kids are still hostages there i dont think ill 
be able to enjoy this freedom 
she said iraqis stole a new volvo from one of her three sisters 
in kuwait and iraqi authorities reacted to her complaint with 
threats 
when my sister started to report that stolen car the officer 
said to the soldiers arrest her mrs cox said 
she was one of several kuwaitborn women who had to accept iraqi 
passports before they could join the evacuation flight 
cox said that kuwaitis have to change their passports they 
had to change their licenses to buy gas maybe theyll have to 
change their citizenship so they can buy food 
asked what his wife would do with her iraqi passport he 
replied burn it throw it away 
mrs cox was adamant in rejecting the view that economic 
sanctions should be given more time to work to force iraq out of 
kuwait 
after they join her husbands parents in orlando fla they 
plan to work for kuwaiti freedom she said 
cox said god bless george bush and the rest of the people 
that are behind him and give them the stamina to stick it out

worst hit was carlentini a town of 10000 people between 
catania and syracuse where members of five families were killed 
when their homes crumbled on top of them as they slept 
the quake struck at about 130 am 530 pm wednesday est 
and registered 47 on the richter scale the ministry of civil 
protection reported it was followed by dozens of aftershocks 
during the day 
there was a huge roar all of a sudden everything shook 
said sebastiano valvo an employee at the syracuse prefects 
office 
the bodies of 13 people were pulled from the rubble in 
carlentini they included two elderly couples a woman her two 
daughters and two grandchildren a 32yearold bar owner and a 
couple and their 18monthold daughter 
the bar owners wife died of her injuries in the hospital in 
lentini

the european community will vote on a 24 billion 
aid package for the soviet union at a summit this weekend and will 
renew demands for iraqs unconditional withdrawal from kuwait 
italian delegates said thursday 
on the eve of the twoday meeting in rome president bush sent a 
letter to italy now ec president urging the europeans to stand 
firm against iraq 
for us the withdrawal of iraq from kuwait must happen without 
conditions said premier giulio andreottis spokesman pio 
mastrobuoni 
he said european leaders were unmoved by iraqs release of 
western hostages and would issue a declaration in line with their 
previous statements demanding iraq abide by un resolutions 
the meeting starting saturday is also expected to launch the 
12nation trading bloc on a radical path of political and economic 
union 
british prime minister john major will make his international 
debut ec officials hope major will be more open to european 
integration than his predecessor margaret thatcher 
her isolation at an ec summit in rome in october was a main 
factor leading to her forced resignation after 11 years in power 
we will miss mrs thatcher because she was the only woman 
sitting with us mastrobuoni told a news conference but i can 
only say that in the preparation phase there has been active 
cooperation from the british side 
a proposed 24 billion food and economic aid package to the 
soviet union will top the agenda 
the proposal by the communitys executive body the european 
commission envisages 1 billion in food aid for 1991 onethird 
in grants and twothirds in guaranteed credits the rest would 
consist of technical help for 1991 and 1992 
bush said wednesday the united states would provide 13 billion 
in loan guarantees for the soviets to buy us farm products and 
manufactured goods 
despite italian confidence that the ec will approve the soviet 
aid the issue remains controversial some member states argue 
moscow will never be able to repay the loans and that help should 
focus on the chaotic soviet distribution system not on handouts 
the european leaders will also consider aid to the new 
democracies of eastern europe the european commission says 
bulgaria poland romania czechoslovakia and hungary as well as 
yugoslavia will need 55 billion in extra financing next year 
on saturday the summit will inaugurate two intergovernmental 
conferences to fashion treaties for monetary economic and 
political union 
calls for a common defense have increased since the persian gulf 
crisis only britain and france for example have sent ground 
forces to the gulf 
but not all ec governments are ready to talk about a joint 
defense policy britain fears undermining the role in europe of the 
usled north atlantic treaty organization while one community 
nation ireland is neutral

a federal judge thursday rejected a request by 
democratic lawmakers to bar president bush from attacking iraqi 
forces without congress permission saying the motion was 
premature 
but us district jude harold h greene held that congress must 
authorize an actual attack and said that under different 
circumstances he would bar a president from unilaterally sending 
us troops to war 
in denying a motion by 54 democrats for a preliminary 
injunction greene said the issue was not ripe because a 
majority of congress hasnt expressed its view on a possible attack 
and bush has not shown a commitment to a definitive course of 
action 
separately another federal judge dismissed a lawsuit by an army 
national guard reservist who challenged bushs power to send him to 
the middle east without congressional approval 
the legal doctrine that courts cannot make a decision unless an 
issue is ripe or ready for adjudication was key to greenes 
holding on the lawmakers request for an injunction barring a us 
attack without bush asking congress for approval 
unless congress as a whole or by a majority is heard from 
the controversy here cannot be deemed ripe greene said 
until then he said bush is entitled to be protected from an 
injunctive order respecting a declaration of war 
but such an injunction could be granted if a majority of 
lawmakers said bush should seek congressional authority and the 
president was clearly committed to early military operations 
amounting to war in the constitutional sense said greene an 
appointee of president carter 
the court has no hesitation in concluding that an offensive 
entry into iraq by several hundred thousand united states 
servicemen could be described as war under the warpowers 
clause of the constitution 
to put it another way the court is not prepared to read out 
of the constitution the clause granting to the congress and to it 
alone the authority to declare war greene said in a 29page 
opinion 
rep ronald v dellums the california democrat who organized 
the lawsuit called greenes decision a victory for the american 
people 
the court has put the president on notice that he must obtain 
prior consent from the congress before he initiates an action 
against iraq dellums said in a statement 
but assistant attorney general stuart m gerson who argued the 
case for the bush administration also claimed victory saying 
greenes decision imposes no limit on the presidents 
prerogatives 
several lawyers familiar with the case said the ripeness 
test could be met if a majority of lawmakers joined the lawsuit or 
congress passed a resolution stating that bush must seek its 
authority to launch an attack 
reps charles e bennett dfla and richard j durbin 
dill plan to introduce a concurrent resolution when congress 
returns in january stating that congress must authorize an 
offensive war in the persian gulf 
greenes analysis differed from that used by his colleague us 
district judge royce c lamberth to dismiss the lawsuit by sgt 
michael r ange a student and former north carolina policeman who 
was sent to the middle east last month when his reserve unit was 
called up 
lamberth an appointee of president reagan held that courts are 
neither equipped nor empowered to intrude into the realm of 
foreign affairs where the constitution grants operational powers to 
the two political branches of government 
greene ruled in the lawmakers case however that while the 
constitution grants to the political branches and in particular to 
the executive responsibility for conducting the nations foreign 
affairs it does not follow that judicial power is excluded from 
the resolution of cases merely because they may touch upon such 
affairs 
greene also rejected as far too sweeping the justice 
dpartments argument that courts are incompetent to decide if the 
nation is at war 
if the executive had the sole power to determine that any 
particular offensive military operation no matter how vast does 
not constitute warmaking but only an offensive military attack 
the congressional power to declare war will be at the mercy of a 
semantic decision by the executive greene said 
michael ratner an attorney for the center for constitutional 
rights which brought both the lawsuits decided thursday said he 
was pleased that greene found that courts can enforce the 
warpowers clause 
he basically affirmed congresss power to be the body that 
gets us into a war ratner said its basically telling the 
president he cant do what he is going to do without getting 
congress to agree beforehand 
another lawyer jules lobel said members of congress would 
study the opinion before deciding whether to appeal the case

representatives of the two warring factions in 
angola met thursday with three outside mediators and a joint 
statement issued afterward reported significant progress toward 
reaching a ceasefire in the countrys civil war 
joining the angolans at the talks were officials from the united 
states the soviet union and portugal the former colonial power in 
angola and site of the five rounds of peace talks held thus far 
this year 
we believe that significant progress has been made and that 
the prospects for a successful sixth round of negotiations in 
lisbon early next year have been enhanced the joint statement 
said 
the statement said the delegates were favorably impressed by the 
friendliness of the atmosphere created by the two angolan parties 
as well as by the seriousness of their approach to the 
negotiations 
the us soviet and portuguese participants held a news 
conference late thursday but declined to cite the areas in which 
progress was made they also said the discussion was an exchange of 
views rather than a negotiating session 
herman cohen the us assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs said that the main point of agreement is that angolas 
leftist government is now willing to implement constitutional 
changes that will convert the country from a oneparty marxist 
state to a multiparty democracy this was agreed to at a party 
congress this past weekend 
the portuguese representative antonio monteiro said an 
enormous gap of confidence has existed between the two factions 
but that this problem is being overcome 
the united states and the soviet union have been arming opposite 
sides in the conflict but have agreed to stop weapons shipments 
once a ceasefire agreement is reached the war has dragged on for 
15 years and killed hundreds of thousands of angolans 
the leader of the angolan rebel movement jonas savimbi said 
thursday after a meeting with president bush that peace prospects 
have improved as a result of joint efforts by the superpowers 
i think both the united states and the soviet union are 
joining hands in trying to find a solution to the angolan 
problem savimbi said after a 20minute meeting with bush during 
which he thanked the president for us support for his forces 
he said his goal is a truce in early 1991 and free and fair 
elections by the end of the year he said the rival factions in 
angola are close to a settlement 
but angolan president jose eduardo dos santos has said that free 
elections are not advisable over the next three years because of 
preparations required for the transition including voter 
registration and clearing oads of mines 
after the white house meeting bushs spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said bush had reaffirmed to dr savimbi the united 
states support for his movement and to express his hope that the 
current negotiations will lead to a ceasefire and a peaceful 
settlement in angola 
asked if the united states would keep supplying arms to the 
unita rebels fitzwater said only were very hopeful that a 
peaceful settlement of this will be reached soon and there will be 
no need for armed conflict

marrow which makes the bodys diseasefighting white blood cells 
after marrow is removed the patient is treated with high doses of 
chemotherapy or radiation or both

removed is put back in the patient gmcsf is given at that time to 
accelerate the marrows production of white blood cells 
immunex is also testing the drug as an adjunct to chemotherapy 
to allow patients to tolerate higher doses of cancerkilling drugs

a gay rights group has filed a lawsuit over 
the refusal of state transportation officials to fully recognize 
the group as participating in an adoptahighway road cleanup 
program 
the north carolina department of transportation agreed in june 
to allow the southern appalachian lesbian and gay alliance of 
asheville to join the program in which groups regularly clean up 
litter on roadsides marked with greenandwhite signs bearing the 
organizations names 
but department officials said they would not place a sign 
identifying salga as the sponsor of a twomile stretch of 
interstate 40 in buncombe county 
the department last year turned down an application from a ku 
klux klan faction it also turned down applications from a 
fayetteville lingerie shop called the bra patch and a chapel hill 
rock band called the sex police 
the lawsuit filed wednesday in us district court in raleigh 
against two highway department officials said the departments 
action denied salgas access to a public forum because of the 
purpose and nature of the organization and the content of its 
members beliefs 
the departments decision was made because salgas 
association and beliefs are offensive to the defendants and 
constitutes a policy of censorship and discrimination said the 
lawsuit which was filed by lawyers paid by the american civil 
liberties union 
or the lawsuit said the decision was made because of 
perceived hostility on the part of some segments of the public to 
the lawful objectives of salga and the beliefs of its members 
thereby giving the force of law to private prejudices and 
irrational stereotypes 
the department has said it would not place a sign bearing 
salgas name because of safety concerns 
the lawsuit cites state and federal constitutional guarantees of 
freedom of speech and equal protection under the law in asking the 
court to direct dot to allow salga to fully participate in the 
program it also asks the court to award the group and its 
chairman teri gibbs an unspecified amount of monetary damages 
the lawsuit lists secretary of transportation tommy harrelson 
and betsy powell director of dots beautification programs as 
defendants 
now its a matter for the courts to decide said william 
powell dot special assistant for operations 
department spokesman joanne latham said in september that dot 
felt that the identification of a group that is perceivd by some 
in notfavorable terms might cause a hazard to groups collecting 
along the road or to others 
ms gibbs said the risks to salga members would be slight 
by the time people read the sign and figured out who we were 
it would take a real concentrated effort for them to do anything to 
us she said 
if the state believes that somebody would commit a crime on 
these people because they are performing a service to the 
community it needs to protect them not prevent them from 
performing the sentence said william simpson jr a lawyer for 
the state chapter of the aclu 
the aclu believes that by denying salgas request the state 
really is empowering prejudices and stereotypes simpson said

4 days old she weighs 250 pounds and still has her claws and 
fangs 
stone county authorities reported that someone shot the animal 
in the face with shotgun birdshot probably on monday morning as it 
was laying alongside a road 
i think it was a very ignorant person with no brains in his 
head falkenbach said for someone to go out and shoot a large 
animal like that with birdshot thats like trying to hunt a 
grizzly bear with a switch 
anyone who sees the lion should stay away from it and call 
authorities he said 
i plan on looking until i find her i have every intention of 
giving her a proper burial if it comes to that falkenbach 
said 
teasha has been missing since dec 6 the cat apparently escaped 
through a small hole at the corner of her 250squarefoot pen 
which is surrounded by an 8foot chainlink fence 
falkenbach an animal trainer who enjoys exotic pets has been 
conducting his own search on land and with an airplane piloted by 
volunteers at college of the ozarks airport

preview first look at the new became part 
of the past thursday as the ambitious but lowrated new syndicated 
series was canceled the move will put its 130member staff out of 
work at years end 
the halfhour weeknight series premiered in august and offered 
celebrity interviews entertainment news and previews of new 
fashions films music and tv shows it had been two years in 
development 
al masini the shows executive producer on thursday notified 
the 80 stations carrying preview that its last telecast will be 
on dec 28 and the last onehour weekend version of the show on 
dec 30 a spokesman said 
masini told his staff of the cancellation wednesday 
like virtually all new syndicated series this season 
preview based here and in los angeles had trouble getting 
audiences 
it had seven commentators on various topics among them singer 
marilyn mccoo and gossip reporter rona elliot 
in his letter to the stations masini said part of the shows 
problem was that it couldnt get significant clearances in the 
evening hours before prime time in such major markets as new york 
los angeles and phildelphia 
nor did it make headway in the important november ratings 
sweeps one of four key periods each year for stations he 
added the stations use the results to set the rates they charge 
advertisers 
the arrival of the november ratings books in the last two 
days did not trigger the success stories we had hoped to see which 
would have triggered the momentum to improve our depth of 
clearance he said 
masini a cocreator of the veteran entertainment tonight 
series is president of new yorkbased television program 
enterprises which makes and syndicates two other successful 
seriesstar search and lifestyles of the rich and famous 
his preview which occasionally used rich and famous 
host robin leach as a commentator ranked 82nd out of 160 
syndicated shows in ratings for far this season according to 
nielsen audience estimates 
it averaged a miniscule 2 rating meaning it was seen in just

the medellin cocaine cartel on thursday 
released a television news producer it had been holding more than 
three months in what appeared to be another step toward a peace 
deal with the government 
a taxi drove up to the offices of medellins el colombiano 
newspaper and dropped off azucena lievano who had been held 
hostage by the drug traffickers for 104 days 
she was one of nine journalists kidnapped by the cartel the past 
several months and the third to be released in less than three 
weeks including a german journalist on monday 
the latest release appeared to be another step toward reaching a 
deal with authorities 
in late november cartel bosses said as many as 300 drug 
traffickers would be willing to surrender in exchange for 
government legal guarantees these include not being being treated 
as criminals and an end to extraditions to the united states where 
they would face trial on drugtrafficking charges 
the government has warmed up to the offer officials have said 
that surrendering traffickers would not be extradited and would 
receive reduced prison sentences if they confess at least one 
crime 
three midlevel drug traffickers have already accepted the 
governments offer and turned themselves in 
however the cartels top bosses pablo escobar and jorge luis 
ochoa remain at large 
juan gomez publisher of el colombiano and former medellin 
mayor said the cartel was releasing the journalists as a step 
toward peace 
the kidnappings have to be resolved before attending the other 
issues gomez said in an interview over the caracol radio 
network 
the cartel said it abducted the journalists in retaliation for 
human rights abuses by police it is also apparently wants to 
pressure the government to grant pardons 
interior minister julio sanchez said the government on friday 
will announce modifications of legislation allowing drug 
traffickers to surrender 
lievano is news producer of televisions cripton news 
journalists still abducted include francisco santos editor of 
colombias biggestselling newspaper el tiempo and diana turbay 
a magazine publisher and daughter of former president julio cesar 
turbay 
the medellin cartel has been blamed for killing 550 colombians 
since the government and drug traffickers declared war on each 
other in august 1989

a flight surgeon with orders for saudi 
arabia is on a hunger strike and hopes he will be discharged from 
the army after becoming too debilitated to work 
capt david wiggins 28 a west point graduate said he opposes 
war and has been trying to get out of the army since february he 
is scheduled to ship out to saudi arabia on monday 
i came away from west point realizing that moral decisions are 
up to you wiggins said war is not a necessary evil because 
nonviolent political change is possible 
he said his hunger strike is designed to make him of no use to 
the army and he believes he soon will be unable to perform his 
duties 
on a diet of water and vitamins the 5foot10inch wiggins said 
his weight has dropped from 167 pounds to 152 he began the fast 
nov 30 after a federal judge refused to overturn the armys ruling 
that he could not be discharged as a consciencious objector 
i am applying for conscientious objector status because i have 
come to the conclusion that it is immoral and futile to defend 
freedom through the use of military force wiggins wrote in his 
application in february 
freedom is a natural human drive spontaneously expressed 
which does not need defense and rebels against force of any kind 
only through nonviolent means can we safely defend our freedom 
wiggins has offered to pay the government for his education at 
new york medical college 
initially an army investigator and other officials concluded 
wiggins merited the consciencious objector status his commanding 
officers blocked the move and his request was rejected by the 
conscientious objector review board in late november a us 
district judge denied wiggins first legal attempt to overturn the 
board 
wiggins said that as an 18yearold he thought war was good 
if america was fighting it 
he described his hometown of waverly ny as an isolated 
conservative town steeped in a white anglosaxon world of god and 
country 
wiggins applied to the us military academy and only one other 
college 
i was very proud to go to west point he said but he said 
life there opened his eyes to a military world different from his 
dreams of glory 
at medical school wiggins said met minorities and people from 
other religions that led him to rethink his world views 
they were good people he said

new laboratory studies suggest that some types 
of cells infected with the aids virus may release a poison that 
disrupts thinking processes and causes the mental decline seen in 
70 percent of aids patients 
weve found that one class of cells when infected with the 
aids virus will release a toxin that can disrupt the nervous 
system said dr dana giulian a researcher at the baylor college 
of medicine in houston 
a research paper on the discovery is to be published friday in 
the journal science 
in an interview giulian said test tube experiments showed that 
monocytes an immune system cell in the blood will secrete poison 
molecules when infected with the human immunodeficiency virus or 
hiv which causes aids 
when these molecules were exposed to neurons it would cause the 
nerve cells to either die or stop functioning said giulian 
this suggests said the researcher that similar cells in the 
brain called macrophages could react the same way when infected 
by hiv this finding said giulian must be confirmed by further 
research 
just why aids patients develop mental decline has long been a 
puzzle to physicians and scientists 
studies disclosed early in the aids epidemic that macrophage 
cells found in the brain can be infected by the hiv virus but 
neurons which are the vital cells to mental function were never 
infected with the virus and yet somehow the neurons were 
damaged 
if you look in the brains there is infection but its not in 
the neurons it has no direct action on the neurons said 
giulian so the question is how does the brain become 
disrupted 
the toxin secreted by the infected cells could be the answer 
giulian said the next job is to identify the secreted molecule 
that is toxic to the brain this he said may be a difficult job 
macrophages are like little biochemical factories he said 
they produce hundreds of different molecules which have toxicity 
on various cells 
in a healthy immune system the macrophage is a vital worker 
against disease it circulates in the blood and will engulf and 
destroy invading bacteria or viruses it also secretes toxins that 
can kill certain cells and it will collect debris such as dead 
cells 
giulians coauthors of the science report were ken vaca and 
christine a noonan also of baylor 
science is the journal of the american association for the 
advancement of science

a leader of the rebels said 
thursday their victory over 200 elite government troops who fled to 
honduras shows low army morale but officials said the soldiers 
merely made a strategic retreat 
the defeat of the army troops wednesday also set off a round of 
fingerpointing among members of the armys ground and air forces 
who each blamed the other for the defeat 
more than two companies of the bracamonte battalion whose 
officers are americantrained retreated into neighboring honduras 
after 40 hours of heavy combat with guerrilla troops 
honduran foreign minister mario carias reported wednesday that 
more than 200 bracamonte troops including about 30 wounded took 
refuge in honduras 
both rebel and government officers said the defeat was due in 
part to lack of air support 
government pilots have become extremely cautious in supporting 
ground troops since nov 23 when the guerrillas shot down a 
warplane with a surfacetoair missile for the first time in the 
11yearold war 
this tremendous licking of the bracamonte troops is a 
political disgrace for the government of alfredo cristiani and a 
military shame for col rene emilio ponce el salvadors defense 
minister the clandestine rebel radio station said on thursday 
elite troops trained in the united states had to take refuge 
in honduras in light of their inability to fight our forces the 
rebel radio said 
combat had raged since tuesday in the northern rrovince of 
chalatenango which borders honduras the fighting is a part of a 
leftist rebel offensive against the rightwing government that 
began nov 20 
guerrilla commander german serrano said the rebel victory 
illustrates the tremendously low morale of the army and the air 
force 
interviewed on rebel radio in chalatenango serrano said the 
air force could not rescue them so they were abandoned its no 
longer a matter of combat morale it transcends morale and takes on 
an aspect of political crisis surrounding the army 
serrano claimed the insurgents inflicted 150 casualties 
including dead and wounded he said they took 14 prisoners 
including three seriously wounded who were handed over to the red 
cross 
at a news conference in tegucigalpa el salvadors ambassador to 
honduras salvador trigueros described the bracamonte soldiers 
move into honduras as a tactical retreat 
because it was impossible to evacuate personnel wounded in 
combat members of el salvadors armed forces opted to take them to 
honduran territory for medical attention the salvadoran 
government said in a communique thursday 
it said armed forces helicopters failed in an attempt to 
evacuate troops after rebel fire injured a pilot and copilot of 
one aircraft and punched holes in another 
repatriation of the stranded soldiers began thursday with a 
flight from tegucigalpa to the air force headquarters at ilopango 
just east of the salvadoran capital of san salvador the government 
said all its troops had returned to home territory by thursday 
afternoon 
an air force helicopter pilot conceded government airmen had 
been seriously shaken by the insurgents downing of two warplanes 
and a helicopter since nov 23 but he also blamed the ground 
troops for becoming too dependent on air support 
what you feel when taking off on a mission now is completely 
different from what you felt three weeks ago said the pilot who 
has thousands of hours of combat flying experience and spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
now its russian roulette its like were about to have a 
fistfight and you pull out a pistol he said 
the pilot added that the infantry had become spoiled with 
regard to air support when they dont get it for whatever reason 
they lose much of their effectiveness 
an infantry lieutenant just returned to the capital after 40 
days of operations in chalatenango contested the airmans 
allegations 
the officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said his 
troops went hungry at times and were low on ammunition because 
helicopter pilots feared landing in zones where rebel antiaircraft 
fire is likely 
the rebels latest offensive is designed to oblige the armed 
forces to make concessions during unmediated peace talks 
tentatively set for late december according to their leaders 
after the rebel victory wednesday the united states criticized 
anew the insurgent force saying it has shown unwillingness to 
negotiate it has refused to discuss anything except the complete 
abolition of the salvadoran army said state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler in washington 
the offensive has killed 342 people since nov 20 according to 
the army another 900 people are estimated to have been wounded 
the army said the rebels claim to have killed or wounded more than 
700 soldiers

a federal judge sentenced a retired cia agent 
thursday to 16 months in prison and fined him 40000 for failing 
to report profits from arms sales made during the irancontra 
affair 
us district judge norman p ramsey ordered thomas g clines to 
pay 200 in court costs and the cost of prosecution which has not 
been determined 
clines prison sentence is the stiffest of any of the 
irancontra defendants including former national security adviser 
john m poindexter and retired marine lt col oliver l north 
i think it was very severe clines said adding he plans to 
appeal 
lawrence walsh irancontra independent counsel whose office 
spent three years tracing the money trail issued a onesentence 
statement in washington thanking ramsey 
we very much appreciate judge ramseys fair and efficient 
handling of the entire prosecution walsh said 
clines 62 of middleburg va was free pending appeal which 
must be filed within 10 days he was convicted sept 18 of two 
charges of failing to report profits of at least 203431 in 1985 
an 57009 in 1986 
he was also convicted of failing to inform the internal revenue 
service about overseas financial accounts and of not filing tax 
forms required for them 
clines had faced up to 16 years in prison and a 1 million fine 
for underreporting the money he made selling weapons to the 
nicaraguan rebels 
during a 10day trial prosecutors characterized clines as a 
sophisticated businessman who established dummy foreign 
corporations to hide his financial dealings from the irs 
defense attorneys argued that clines misunderstood how to report 
his earnings and was unfamiliar with irs regulations that required 
him to report foreign financial accounts clines attorney paula m 
junghans contended that clines was a victim of selective government 
prosecution accusing walsh of going after her client for political 
reasons 
she said she was disappointed by the sentence but did not 
elaborate 
clines sentencing was postponed from nov 30 because of 
jockeying between the prosecution and defense over a probation 
officers report that the chief prosecutor stuart e abrams argued 
did not accurately reflect clines worth 
junghans said attorney fees and other expenses had depleted 
clines finances 
ramsey said the income statement was irrelevant to the fine he 
imposed the judge said he based the fine on the amount of income 
clines failed to report to the irs 
walshs office spent 221 million through aug 31 abrams said 
the cost of the clines prosecution was not immediately available 
clines tested bought and arranged shipments of rifles machine 
guns grenades and explosives to the contra rebels at a time when 
they were outlawed by congress 
witnesses testified that clines was in the arms business with 
retired air force maj gen richard v secord and his business 
partner albert hakim the three shared some profits with canadian 
arms dealer emanuel weigensberg 
the operation was directed by poindexter and north 
clines was prosecuted in baltimore because his tax preparer is 
from bethesda md 
so far eight people and one corporation have either been found 
guilty or pleaded guilty to crimes arising out of the irancontra 
affair 
on each of two counts of underreporting his income clines 
received separate eightmonth sentences to run consecutively 
on two counts of failing to report foreign accounts to the irs 
clines received two consecutive sixmonth sentences to be served 
at the same time as the 16month term 
for each of the four counts he was fined 10000 
north received a threeyear suspended prison sentence two years 
probation 150000 in fines and 1200 hours of community service 
poindexter who was convicted of five felonies was sentenced to 
six month prison sentences on each count to be served currently and 
250 in court costs he has appealed his conviction

shelves thursday following a voluntary onemonth recall after 
traces of benzene were found in the product company officials 
said 
routine testing by the florida department of health last month 
found minute traces of benzene in the beverage the levels were 
much lower than those considered normal in many common food 
products such as fruits and coffee the company said

in eight flavors such as orange amp mango and raspberry guava amp 
apple

springs international providing a quality product is at the core 
of our business 
the company said it voluntarily withdrew its beverages from the 
market while tests were being conducted to confirm its safety and 
to ensure there was no external source of contamination the tests 
were conducted because the products were classified as a bottled 
water

veterans of successful efforts to limit 
the number of years lawmakers stay in office offered advice 
thursday on how to throw the rascals out lesson no 1 dont call 
em rascals 
most of them arent rascals said colorado state sen terry 
considine who backed his states termlimiting law they come to 
it lawmaking with a good heart 
considine spoke at a daylong conference attended by more than 
100 people from at least 20 states who say they are part of a 
growing national movement to get rid of the career lawmaker 
people are organizing in all 50 states said paul beckner 
executive director of citizens for congressional reform in 
washington dc another conference panelist its clear we have 
a broadbased movement 
considines panel comprised political activists who led 
victorious campaigns to limit the terms and reelection bids of 
legislators in california colorado and oklahoma 
negative campaigns are tempting but unwise they said recent 
history offers the best illustration despite widespread anger at 
politicians for such blunders as the savings and loan crisis 
voters across the country in 1990 reelected 97 percent of 
incumbents running for state and congressional offices 
instead the activists said campaigns to limit service in the 
state houses and congress should emphasize a return to a citizen 
legislature the peoples government intended by the nations 
founders 
what we need is citizen legislators who call it like they see 
it then return home to their real jobs sais considine 
the movement if it is one has a sense of humor in oregon the 
effort to limit lawmakers tenure goes by the slogan let 
incumbents mosey into the sunset or limits 
ed crane president of the cato institute in washington dc 
which does policy analysis said the public no longer wants career 
legislators but people who view service as their civic duty 
what we want are people in a citizen legislature who view 
themselves as on a leave of absence from their real jobs crane 
said this movement is an opportunity for americans to regain 
control of their government 
crane warned that the grass roots movement though widely 
supported could be hurt if politicians support it that includes 
president bush who will call for limits on congressional terms 
during his state of the union address next month that was 
disclosed earlier this week by chief of staff john sununu though 
he didnt give specifics 
it would be much better if the movement were citizenled he 
said bush and vice president dan quayle did real damage when 
they came to this state to support proposition 140 
colorado voters this year approved limits of eight years in 
office for members of both chambers of their state legislature 
they also approved a limit of 12 years in office for their us 
senators and representatives the first such initiative to deal 
with jobs in congress conference organizers said 
the california referendum which passed in november with 52 
percent of the vote set limits of three twoyear terms for 
assembly members and two fouryear terms for state senators the 
law also limited state executives including the governor to two 
fouryear terms 
in oklahoma this year voters approved a limit of 12 years in 
office for their state lawmakers

former drug policy director william bennett on 
thursday spurned president bushs offer to be chairman of the 
republican national committee after white house lawyers told him 
hed have to give up a book contract and other outside income 
i didnt take a vow of poverty bennett told reporters after 
giving chief of staff john sununu his letter declining the offer 
just two weeks after hed accepted it 
bennett indicated he was initially told by the white house that 
his plans to write two books and accept payments for speeches would 
not present a problem 
however bennett said the advice changed he said he was 
told by white house counsel boyden gray that accepting the outside 
income while serving as rnc chairman would violate the ethics in 
government act 
one source familiar with the backandforth said gray had 
cautioned bennett early on about the risks of appearance of 
impropriety but backed off under pressure from sununu who wanted 
bennett to be able to take the job the source spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
thursdays surprise development was an embarrassment to both 
bush and bennett and sent the white house scurrying in search for a 
new candidate to take over daytoday operation of the party from 
the ailing lee atwater 
however some party regulars who had never been comfortable 
with the notion of the combative arch conservative bennett as 
party chairman expressed relief 
i thought bennett was a mistake in the first place said 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan hed only been a 
republican for about four years never run for office and to me 
its got to be somebody who understands and likes politics 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush was 
disappointed and that a replacement had not been chosen the rnc 
was expected to rubber stamp bushs choice 
administration and republican sources said that secretary of 
transportation samuel skinner hud secretary jack kemp secretary 
of commerce robert mosbacher defeated sen rudy boschwitz 
rminn mississippi gop leader haley barbour and longtime party 
operative rich bond were among those being considered also one 
party source said bush had spoken to former rep thomas loeffler of 
texas about the job but had not offered it to him loeffler is a 
close friend of the president 
republican sources said bond was lobbying for the job but 
barbour said he wasnt interested 
i just dont have an interest in it barbour said in a 
telephone interview i am not soliciting the job and would not 
want it if asked but i dont think im under consideration 
bennett 47 outspoken and controversial resigned nov 8 as 
bushs drug enforcement control director he was secretary of 
education during the reagan administration and now is a fellow at 
the hudson institute a conservative political research 
organization 
in a letter to bush written on hudson institute stationery 
bennett told bush 
i share your commitment to the highest ethical standards in 
public service and i would not want to do anything to jeopardize 
our shared commitment to those standards 
he cited a longstanding contractual commitment to simon and 
schuster to write two books including one on his experiences in 
government 
bennett received a 187500 advance from simon amp schuster for 
the two books according to financial disclosure forms 
he spent it hes either got to write the book or pay it 
back fitzwater said hes not a millionaire 
even so bennett reported receiving 240000 in speaking fees 
alone in the four months between his resignation as education 
secretary in september 1988 and when he was given the job as drug 
policy director 
he would have made 125100 a year as rnc chairman 
fitzwater said bush bennett and gray met wednesday at the white 
house to see if there was any way around the dilemma and decided 
there wasnt 
other party chairmen including atwater and democratic chairman 
ron brown have been able to supplement their income with private 
earnings 
but bennett because of his recent administration job is 
covered by a provision of the ethics in government act that deals 
with former government officials 
that measure bars former officials from lobbying or even 
having extended contact with the executive branch for one year 
after their departure 
it would have been tough for him to have accepted money for 
speeches for example from corporations or consulting groups and 
then go to business with a cabinet agency or somehow else that he 
would have to consult with for rnc business fitzwater said 
administration and gop sources said that bennett was furious at 
the changing signals from the white house and from gray in 
particular 
two weeks ago i got a green light two days ago i got a yellow 
to red bennett said 
however bennett told reporters that he had gotten similar 
advice from two other lawyers including his brother 
gray told the associated press he warned bennett all along that 
there were restrictions on whom he could speak to 
at the time it was hypothetical whom he would speak to 
gray said 
but he said bennett subsequently lined up speaking engagements 
with various industry and trade groups that had direct interests in 
lobbying the administration on policy matters 
gray also said the justice department had been working on an 
opinion sure to have been controversial saying that the oneyear 
ban on contact with an officials former agency was not meant to 
apply to party chairmen 
dnc chairman brown said bennetts tenure lasted about as long 
as most of president bushs campaign promises democrats also 
offered some tongueincheek help to the rnc attaching a mock 
help wanted ad to browns statement 
some republicans were critical of gray 
the chairman of the republican national committee is not a 
government position its an elective position by that body said 
gop consultant eddie mahe if anybody has any right to impose any 
limits its the rnc not boyden gray

former automaker john z delorean was 
fined 451000 by state environmental officials who allege water 
pollution violations at his estate 
delorean 65 said he was innocent of the civil charges 
his attorney herbert bennett said delorean is contesting the 
violations and has asked for a hearing before an administrative law 
judge 
on 30 occasions between may 1987 and march 1990 the sewage 
treatment plant on deloreans 440acre estate discharged too much 
oil and grease chlorine suspended solids and organic material 
into middle brook john hagerty a spokesman for the state 
department of environmental protection said thursday 
the discharge poses no hazard to human or aquatic life but 
destroys the brook he said 
delorean received notice of the violations in october 
hagerty called 451000 an average fs water qualityine for the type 
of 
treatment plant which treats 840 gallons of sewage a day 
delorean was acquitted in august 1984 of drug smuggling charges

a judge thursday dismissed a 
firstdegree murder charge against the inventor of a suicide 
device saying he broke no law in helping an alzheimers disease 
patient kill herself 
the judge announced his decision after hearing a tape of the 
oregon woman discuss her fight against the disease ive had 
enough she said on the tape 
janet adkins suffered from alzheimers disease but might still 
be alive had she not turned on dr jack kevorkians device june 4 
district judge gerald mcnally said at the end of kevorkians 
twoday preliminary examination 
but because michigan law doesnt outlaw suicide or assisting in 
it prosecutors had no case against kevorkian mcnally said in 
dismissing the charge against kevorkian a 62yearold retired 
pathologist from royal oak 
there was scattered applause in the courtroom as kevorkian 
turned without expression to shake the hand of his lawyer geoffrey 
fieger 
i feel like im walking on a cloud kevorkian said on his 
way out of the courthouse 
michael modelski chief assistant oakland county prosecutor 
said his office was considering whether to appeal mcnallys ruling 
to circuit court that court could reinstate the firstdegree 
murder charge or a lesser charge such as seconddegree murder or 
manslaughter he said 
it was just nice to get a ruling modelski said i think 
everyone realizes this isnt the final step 
adkins husband ronald said he was relieved the judge 
dismissed the case 
i and the family are very pleased and very grateful for the 
judge making the decision that he did adkins said from his 
portland home its very definitely a relief in the sense that 
the family would have to go through this all again its really 
been very hard for us over the last six months 
despite the dismissal kevorkian isnt free to use his device 
again 
three days after adkins died prosecutors obtained a temporary 
court order preventing further use of the device the contraption 
remains in police custody pending a civil trial probably in 
january on whether that order should be made permanent fieger 
said 
prosecutor richard thompson filed the murder charge nearly six 
months after adkins died in the back of kevorkians van in a 
countyowned campground kevorkian notified authorities after 
adkins was dead he was questioned by state police but wasnt 
arrested until dec 3 
autopsy results released in late november showed adkins 54 of 
portland committed suicide with an overdose of medication fieger 
said in closing arguments that kevorkian attached an intravenous 
tube to adkins right arm but the tube carried only a harmless 
saline solution 
the drugs that caused adkins to lose consciousness and then 
stopped her heart didnt enter her body until after she threw the 
switch on kevorkians device fieger said 
closing arguments were heard after the prosecution played a 
40minute videotape police seized after searching kevorkians 
apartment 
on the tape made june 2 in a motel room kevorkian janet and 
ronald adkins discuss her struggle with alzheimers which causes 
irreversible brain degeneration and her decision to ask 
kevorkians help in ending her life 
adkins gave short and generally clear answers to questions posed 
by kevorkian and her husband 
my life before was wonderful adkins says i could play 
the piano and read i cant do any of those things now its 
too taxing 
why do you want your life to end kevorkian asks 
ive had enough adkins answers her voice breaking 
on the tape adkins nd her husband who was not present at 
kevorkians court examination this week tell kevorkian they 
learned of his device from reading a newsweek magazine article and 
decided to seek him out asked by kevorkian whether he solicited 
their business adkins says no no no no 
i want to get out adkins said 
kevorkian has said he received no fee from the adkins 
in announcing his decision the judge called on the legislature 
to address the issues raised by kevorkian a bill introduced by 
state sen fred dillingham would make assisting in a suicide a 
felony punishable by four years in prison and a 2000 fine

an ambulance operator billed two 
brothers after the duo saved three children from a fire but the 
company said thursday the demand for 61 was all a big mistake 
it was simply an administrative error they were not supposed 
to be charged in the first place said pamela rosen a 
spokeswoman for scv paramedical service as soon as it was called 
to our attention we said of course they are not supposed to be 
billed 
but jerry robles 38 said he thinks the company is trying to 
pull the wool over his eyes he said he believes the operator 
simply decided not to bill him and his brother gary after the 
matter received attention from the media 
the brothers spotted smoke coming from the second story window 
of a san jose condominium on nov 4 gary robles a morgan hill 
resident struggled through the thick smoke to help lead the 
children ages 14 months 2 and 4 years to safety 
the original bill from the ambulance was 109 with 61 for 
emergency response 42 for oxygen and 6 for the nozzle of the 
oxygen mask 
the bill was reduced after the company realized that san jose 
firefighters administered oxygen to one brother from their own 
truck 
its totally unfair said battalion chief dan bourbon before 
the bill was withdrawn if it wasnt for them wed have three 
dead kids they scv should forget the bill 
bourbon said he remembered the brothers refusing an ambulance 
ride to a hospital jerry robles said he and his brother turned it 
down because of the cost 
jerry robles said he tried to explain to the company why they 
shouldnt be billed 
i phoned them but they bounced me from supervisor to 
supervisor he said they said the firemen borrowed the oxygen 
equipment from them and we had to pay for it 
i didnt know you could get in trouble for helping people 
jerry robles said we were shocked to get the bill so were our 
friends were kind of leery now about helping people if you can 
get charged for doing good

the housatonic boy scout council broke new 
ground thursday when it appointed the first woman scout executive 
in the country 
mary l portis of west haven will fill the vacancy left by jack 
ross who was transferred to the cape cod council 
i have thought for a long time that women can do anything 
portis said i am happy that in the 90s a woman can become a 
scout executive 
portis who would be responsible for coordinating scouting in 
six cities and towns was selected from eight finalists 
she was clearly the most qualified candidate council 
president john rak said to us the fact that she happens to be a 
woman is totally irrelevant 
there are six boy scout councils in the state and about 400 in 
the country the councils comprised of executives oversee the 
operation of scouting within defined territories 
in the past women wrre barred from leadership roles in the 
scout organization but in february 1988 the national council voted 
to abolish gender restrictions 
portis will begin her new duties jan 16

beverly hills must install a christmas tree 
next to a 28foot hanukkah menorah or move the menorah next to an 
existing tree a federal judge ruled thursday in a lawsuit between 
two jewish groups 
us district judge terry j hatter said a us supreme court 
decision concerning religious symbols on public property clearly 
allows such displays but only if both the menorah and the christmas 
tree are represented and are close together 
what i am going to order is that the menorah be moved so that 
it is next to the tree that has been designated to symbolize a 
secular christmas tree and that no religious ceremonies be held 
there hatter said 
marshall grossman an attorney for chabad a movement of hasidic 
jews said the group paid 25000 to install the menorah an array 
of nine candles on a permanent foundation and could not easily 
move it 
hatter said a large christmas tree could be brought to the site 
and could be lighted next to the menorah 
your honor i can probably do that myself said grossman 
it may be the first time ive purchased a christmas tree but i 
think i can get rabbinical approval 
the american jewish congress and four jewish residents of 
beverly hills backed by the american civil liberties union filed 
a civil rights lawsuit seeking the menorahs removal they claimed 
that having the menorah on public property was a violation of first 
amendment guarantees of separation of church and state they also 
drew support thursday from the union of american hebrew 
congregations 
grossman protested when the judge ruled that no religious 
ceremonies could be held in front of the menorah which stands 
across the street from city hall 
hatter denied a request from beverly hills attorney mitchell 
abbott to stay his temporary restraining order from taking effect 
until further arguments could be made 
aclu lawyers carol sobel and douglas mirell pressed for quick 
action saying any delay would allow the menorah to stand alone 
through the eightnight celebratin of hanukkah which began tuesday 
night 
although the city has two official christmas trees and lighted 
street decorations the attorneys said they are not close enough to 
the menorah to provide equal representation 
hatter suggested that the presence of two symbols might help to 
spread holiday cheer 
our society is in need of any sustenance of a positive 
nature the judge said 
the court is abiding by the letter of what the supreme court 
said aclu attorney mirell said outside court he called the 
ruling a clear victory for the plaintiffs 
grossman disagreed 
the net result of this misguided effort is that this year 
instead of there being two christmas trees and one menorah in 
beverly hills there will now be an additional christmas tree he 
said

a nobel peace prizewinning group of physicians 
announced plans thursday to send a delegation to the persian gulf 
to address the medical consequences of a war and possibly meet with 
iraqi president saddam hussein 
they are not our enemy we are not their enemy the enemy is 
war said dr bernard lown copresident of the international 
physicians for the prevention of nuclear war 
lown said the delegation is making the peace trip after appeals 
from egypt jordan and a very insistent invitation from iraq 
the organization which was founded 10 years ago and represents 
more than 200000 doctors worldwide was awarded the nobel peace 
prize in 1985 for its contributions to lessen the tensions of the 
cold war 
lown said the iraqi request came from abbas takriti the 
president of the iraqi medical association 
the physicians were expected to fly to the region friday and 
meet with officials in cairo amman and baghdad during the eight 
day trip besides saddam the group also hoped for meetings with 
king hussein of jordan and president mubarek of egypt 
iraq invaded neighboring kuwait aug 2 since then troops from 
the united states and other countries have been poised in saudi 
arabia 
the un security council has set a jan 15 deadline for iraq to 
relinquish kuwait or face possible attack 
the leaders in the persian gulf region are concerned because if 
war should break out the greatest number of casualties probably 
would be civilians lown said 
the group to visit the persian gulf includes lown dr john 
pastore the secretary of the ippnw dr ulrich gottstein of 
germany the ippnws vicepresident for europe dr sergei 
kolesnikov of the soviet union a president of the ussr academy of 
medical sciences and william monning the ippnws executive 
director 
lown said the primary message the physicians hope to send is 
peace 
we believe that if our mission helps to educate the word about 
the tragic human costs that will result from a war peace will 
become a greater imperative he said

a jury thursday convicted a paroled child 
killer of murdering 10 women during the past two years rejecting 
arguments that he was insane 
the monroe county court jury deliberated 6 hours over two days 
before deciding arthur j shawcross was guilty of 10 counts of 
seconddegree murder 
there is no firstdegree murder charge in new york state jurors 
could have convicted showcross of manslaughter 
shawcross 45 was arrested jan 4 a day after state police 
spotted him near the frozen body of one of the victims he 
confessed to the crimes during police questioning at the time he 
was on parole for a 1972 slaying 
the women were slain between march 1988 and january 1990 
nine of shawcross victims were prostitutes and all frequented 
the streets of downtown rochester most were strangled and their 
bodies left hidden along the genesee river or in other secluded 
locations 
shawcross showed no reaction as the verdict was read he faces a 
trial in neighboring wayne county next year for the slaying of 
29yearold elizabeth gibson 
after the verdict relatives of the victims swarmed around 
assistant district attorney charles siragusa many had tears in 
their eyes as they hugged and shook hands with the prosecutor 
siragusa did a 100 percent job said pattie trippi whose 
sister darlene was slain im just glad the verdict was murder 
thats justice i hope hes never ever let out 
jackie dennis aunt of victim maria welch said she attended the 
trial because she hoped it would help ease the pain of her nieces 
death 
she said she was relieved by the verdict but nothings going 
to bring maria back 
shawcross faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life on each 
of the 10 counts he will be sentenced feb 1 by judge donald j 
wisner 
defense lawyer thomas cocuzzi said he would appeal the 
conviction the defense had asked for a mistrial on the grounds 
that statements by its own witness psychiatrist dr dorothy lewis 
had biased jurors wisner denied the motion 
im disappointed but im not going to criticize this jury 
cocuzzi said whether or not he had a fair trial is up to an 
appellate court 
in 1972 shawcross confessed to strangling 8yearold karen ann 
hill and served 15 years in prison before being released on parole 
in 1987 he had also confessed to the 1972 killing of 10yearold 
jack blake in watertown but was not prosecuted because of 
insufficient evidence 
karens mother helene hill was in the court thursday as the 
prosecutor left the courtroom she embraced him this is the 
greatest christmas present we all could receive she said 
fighting back tears 
during the trial lewis testified that shawcross suffered from 
brain damage and posttraumatic stress disorder brought on by 
childhood abuse and traumatic experiences in vietnam shawcross did 
not testify but jurors watched videotapes of him being interviewed 
under hypnosis by lewis 
prosecution psychiatrist dr park dietz argued that shawcross 
was faking mental illness to avoid being sent to prison 
jury foreman robert edwards said the jurors were not convinced 
either by the insanity claim 
we didnt buy it he said the evidence they had for it 
was very poor and there was too much evidence against it that was 
very good

the nuclear regulatory commission on 
thursday tightened radiationexposure limits for nuclear plant 
workers and residents near atomic power facilities the revision 
was the first in more than 30 years 
the agency said the new regulations by reflecting recent 
scientific studies will provide an extra margin of safety yet 
the commission said the current standards do not put workers at 
risk 
antinuclear groups immediately criticized the new regulation 
which does not take effect for two years critics argued that the 
tightened limits still put people at too high a risk of cancer and 
are based on outdated health information 
the commission is straining its credibility by adopting an 
obsolete standard said the nuclear information and resource 
service an antinuclear umbrella group it said the new standards 
reflect recommendations made by leading scientists 13 years ago 
the nrcs revised standards approved unanimously by the 
commission will replace radiationexposure limits in effect since 
1957 for atomic plant workers and people living near nuclear 
facilities 
the new rules require that by january 1993 the nuclear 
industry assure that 
the maximum exposure to the general population from atomic 
facilities be no more than 100 millirems a year a fifth of what is 
now allowed 
atomic workers be exposed to no more than 5 rems of radiation a 
year now some workers can be exposed to four times that amount 
under certain conditions an nrc official said 
plant operators be required to adopt policies keeping radiation 
doses as low as reasonably achievable instead of merely being 
urged to do so as is now the law 
according to government studies the average american can expect 
to be exposed to about 360 millirems of radiation from various 
sources a year radiation from an xray is about 6 to 7 millirems 
atomic plant workers on average are exposed to an additional 400 
millirems or so annually although that amount can be considerably 
higher nrc officials said 
the new rules also establish tighter exposure standards for 
pregnant workers at atomic facilities limiting exposure to 500 
millirems over the course of the pregnancy 
a rem which is the standard measure of radiation equals 1000 
millirems 
the new rules reflect changes in the basic philosophy of 
radiation protection and provide a substantial increase in 
safety said donald cool chief of the nrcs radiation protection 
and health effects branch 
the requirements will affect commercial nuclear plants various 
laboratories and facilities involved in uranium production 
cool said most of the nuclear industry has procedures in place 
aimed at meeting the tighter standards although some 
uraniumprocessing facilities may have to alter their operating 
procedures 
the cost of compliance for the nuclear industry was estimated at 
170 million 
the new requirements are based on recommendations to limit 
radiation exposure made by the international commission on 
radiological protection in 1977 
critics questioned whether the new requirements will make 
working conditions safer for plant workers and nearby residents 
a part of the rules some methods for calculating exposure 
levels were changed to allow the release of increased 
concentrations of many radioisotopes as long as exposure doses 
remain within the required limits 
cool said these changes reflect new scientific information on 
radiation and do not pose increased health risks but michael 
mariotte executive director of the nuclear information and 
resource service argued that the higher concentrations that will 
be released actually amount to the nrc increasing allowable 
radiation levels instead of providing additional safeguards 
mariotte also questioned the nrcs use of 1977 recommendations 
when the same international organization is due to recommend 
tougher standards with months 
last june the international group said it is planning to 
recommend that workers radiation exposure be limited to no more 
than 2 rems per year instead of the 5 rems included in the new nrc 
rules 
the nrc said it didnt believe the imposition of a 2 
remperyear ceiling for atomic workers was needed in 1987 said 
the agency 97 percent of all workers at nuclear plants and other 
atomic facilities were exposed to less than 2 rems of radiation 
annually

hispanic groups filed a lawsuit thursday seeking 
to delay election of aldermen until after the city redistricts the 
wards they represent 
the federal lawsuit alleges that the citys plan to redistrict 
after the feb 26 aldermanic elections dilutes the strength of 
hispanic voters 
the current schedule in effect creates a system where the 
aldermen dont represent the districts theyre elected to said 
rubin castillo director of the mexican american legal defense and 
educational fund one of the lawsuits plaintiffs 
other plaintiffs are the league of women voters the puerto 
rican parade committee the spanish action committee of chicago and 
10 individuals the lawsuit was filed in us district court on 
behalf of latino and other registered voters 
mayor richard m daley a defendant in the lawsuit opposes 
postponing the aldermanic elections because he believes it will be 
too costly to elect alderman and city officials at separate times 
his press secretary said 
the mayors position is that the whole matter is something to 
be decided by the courts said press secretary avis lavelle 
but he believes it makes more sense to have the elections go on 
as planned 
daley is seeking reelection in february candidates for 
aldermen are seeking fouryear terms 
castillo said 1990 us census figures are expected to show 
400000 more hispanics living in the city now than in 1980 
those voters wont have a say in electing their aldermen until 
1995 under the current schedule castillo said 
the lawsuit seeks to force the city to redistrict as soon as 
census data become available in march or april the elections could

prisoner rights dont extend to playing the 
illinois lottery a federal appeals court has ruled 
jessie hach 38 serving a life sentence at menard correctional 
center for murder and armed robbery contended prison officials had 
unfairly denied him permission to play the lottery by mail 
hatch filed a civilrights lawsuit in 1988 when he was an inmate 
at stateville prison near joliet 
a threejudge panel of the 7th us circuit court of appeals 
ruled tuesday that playing the lottery is a privilege not a right 
the decision upheld an earlier ruling by a district judge 
corrections officials cited security concerns and prison rules 
against gambling salvador godinez then an assistant warden at 
stateville prison told the district judge that lottery 
subscriptions would be another vehicle for inmate barter and might 
lead to thefts and extortion 
hatch contended that sending money to play the lottery was no 
different than sending money earned at prison jobs to invest in 
stocks bonds or savings accounts 
the court disagreed 
once prison officials allow inmates to have some personal 
property or to engage in some financial transactions they should 
not be powerless to draw the line the courts opinion said

labor party leader shimon peres said thursday 
he was checking reports that hundreds of trailer homes were being 
moved to the occupied territories possibly to house soviet 
immigrants israeli media reported 
the national itim news agency said housing minister ariel sharon 
insisted israel was abiding by promises to the united states not to 
send immigrants to the west bank or gaza strip 
the united states has conditioned 400 million in housing loan 
guarantees for immigration on the funds not being spent on building 
homes in the occupied territories 
prime minister yitzhak shamir asked for additional financial 
help to accommodate the immigration wave in his talks with us 
leaders in washington this week 
israel television and itim quoted peres as telling leftleaning 
labors 120member leadership bureau he heard the government was 
erecting hundreds of trailer homes in the west bank 
itim said peres added he was checking these reports without 
elaborating on their source 
once the trailers are built there they will say we have no 
choice the immigrants have no place to live and then they will be 
forced to move there peres reportedly added 
more than 155000 soviet immigrants have arrived this year and 
the influx has created a national housing shortage 
sharon of shamirs rightwing likud bloc accused peres of 
speaking out of internal political and personal considerations 
and trying to place obstacles to the immigration effort 
the government has clearly stated we are settling immigrants 
in united jerusalem and galilee and the negev desert we are not 
sending immigrants to judea samaria and gaza sharon said using 
biblical names for the west bank 
it is not because we have changed our strategic thinking about 
these areas but so as not to harm the immigration sharon said 
in a statement published by itim 
israel has settled about 100000 jews in the west bank and gaza 
since capturing them from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east 
war these territories are home to 17 million palestinians 
the likud holds these areas are integral parts of historic 
israel labor believes some of the lands should be relinquished as 
part of a peace settlement with arab neighbors

there may not be a more magical moment in 
musical theater than the end of the first act of peter pan 
when the boy who refuses to grow up flies off to neverland with 
three very proper english children theatergoers usually soar right 
along with them a good test of any production is how well this 
enchanting scene is done 
well fans of sandy duncan and even mary martin can rest easy 
this latest revival which opened thursday at broadways 
luntfontanne theater after a yearlong national tour does just 
fine 
that comes as something of a surprise because the shows star 
cathy rigby is a performer better known for her gymnastic ability 
she was an olympic gold medal winner in 1972 than for her 
acting singing and dancing but rigby is something of a 
revelation 
she certainly flies faster higher and with more grace than any 
of her predecessors whats more unexpected is that rigby is 
completely at home on a broadway stage shes a good singer with a 
strong clear voice able to negotiate the obvious showstoppers 
i gotta crow and im flying as well as more hearttugging 
songs such as distant melody 
rigby is a spunky actress her peter pan is a rough and tumble 
cocky kid that brash physicality not only helps her do battle with 
all those pirates and indians but also helps in forming a 
distinctive character the tough little boy afraid to show any 
emotion or accept responsibility 
rigby has a dastardly and very funny opponent is stephen hanan 
whose capt hook is extravagant without being campy cindy robinson 
exudes a ladylike bossiness as wendy while britt west and chad 
hutchison are believable as her two brothers 
director fran soder gives the show a sharper darker tinge than 
previous productions had the audience is aware of the double edge 
of jm barries story its fun not to grow up but theres no 
way unless youre peter pan that you can avoid it 
the wonderful score a joint effort by moose charlap and carolyn 
leigh and jule styne and betty comden and adolph green remains a 
joy its a rare collection of songs that both children and adults 
can enjoy 
if the new choreography by marilyn magness doesnt make you 
forget jerome robbins original contributions at least its lively 
and occasionally funny 
the production especially the exotic greenery of neverland 
looks spiffy not like a thinnedout touring company that has been 
on the road too long all of this wouldnt matter if the producers 
hadnt found a highflying pan but they have one whose swoops 
dips and soarings are actually heartstopping 
one more thing wait for the final curtain call rigby does more 
than zoom around the stage she takes her midair magic right out 
over the audience

two women who baked cookies for troops 
stationed in the persian gulf are fuming because the sweets ended 
up in california homeless shelters 
gina root and deborah lien of corvallis spent about 75 to send 
150 pounds of cookies about three weeks ago to stephen butler in la 
mesa calif the women thought the cookies would soon be on a 
flight to the gulf 
this week root received a letter from a volunteer in a homeless 
shelter in la mesa thanking her for the donation 
im furious root said thursday these cookies are for our 
service people not for the homeless in california it just 
stinks 
butler said he distributed the cookies and many others he 
received to homeless shelters because he was deluged with treats 
for the troops and never intended to become the national organizer 
of operation cookie 
he said he volunteered to organize the local los angeles cookie 
effort but after talking to a reporter and the story being picked 
up by newspapers across the country he was covered up in cookies 
for weeks his living room has been full of cookies 
root said if butler had more cookies than he could handle he 
should have refused to accept shipment 
butler said he scrounged to find a way to get the cookies 
overseas he said military planes take the cookies only on a 
spaceavailable basis and most flights have been full 
it was either give them to homeless shelters or throw them in 
the trash butler said 
he said he thought the honorable thing to do was to give the 
cookies to shelters 
ive been deluged by angry old ladies giving me tons of 
suggestions of what i should have done with the cookies he said 
from now on ill just let them spoil or throw them away im fed 
up with it

wendell shroyer was driving along a scenic 
stretch of interstate 75 when the road suddenly was obscured by 
thick fog his thoughts of visiting relatives in florida were 
interrupted by screams 
ill never forget it i heard someone screaming from 
underneath a truck said shroyer of battle creek mich 
before the fog had lifted tuesday morning there were more than 
80 wrecked cars 13 people killed and more than 50 injured 
the drive between knoxville and chattanooga rolls along in view 
of hills that descend from the southern appalachians dairy and 
cattle farms line both sides of the highway 
on some warm mornings fog rises off the hiwassee river and 
blankets the highway near this town 40 miles northeast of 
chattanooga producing a sense of solitude 
tuesdays fog produced fear and chaos 
i came into the fog and couldnt see 10 feet in front of me 
said virgil metts a tennessee valley authority employee from 
knoxville who was traveling to chattanooga 
motorists said the fog rose like a wall as they approached the 
calhoun exit on the heavily traveled highway 
federal investigators said they would look into whether a nearby 
paper mills steam emissions contributed to the heavy fog although 
the stretch of highway is notorious for thick pockets of fog 
investigators are seeking information from motorists who drive 
the highway regularly and are familiar with its conditions said 
robert barlett head of the national transportation safety board 
team reviewing the crash 
the team has talked with 14 people involved in the crash and 
scheduled interviews with 25 others barlett said at a briefing 
thursday 
barlett said that the quick response of rescue and cleanup teams 
made it hard to reconstruct the accident because most evidence had 
been removed by time investigators arrived but he emphasized that 
this was not a criticism your first priority in any accident is 
to rescue your survivors immediately that takes precedence over 
everything 
five of the 13 victims were still unidentified thursday said 
dr iris snider assistant mcminn county coroner 
a chainreaction crash in the same area in 1978 involved 61 
vehicles and injured 46 people three people were killed and 14 
injured in a 1979 accident involving 18 vehicles 
on tuesday brakes screeched and tires squealed as drivers saw 
tail lights flicker ahead of them 
and then the damp gray air was filled with the violent sound of 
cars pickups and tractortrailer rigs smashing into each other and 
bursting into flames the travelers said 
for three minutes after i stopped cars kept hitting each 
other said metts they kept driving into the fog at 60 mph 
it was deadly silent a real eerie silence you couldnt see 
anything because of the fog and all you heard was exploding gas 
tanks 
clyde wilder of knoxville and mark compton of greeneville 
tenn were headed south in a tractortrailer when a voice on their 
citizens band radio warned of a real bad wreck ahead 
somebody hit the fog and somebody hit their brakes and it just 
started piling up compton said 
those who were able leaped from their cars and jumped into the 
median and tried to help those who werent wails from the injured 
filled the smoky air some of those who were rescued had to be 
restrained from returning to their smashed vehicles 
george and margaret dawson were southbound moving from michigan 
to florida to retire their minivan was loaded with valuables they 
didnt trust to the movers seconds later those valuables were 
scattered across the highway 
we came on it so fast but we still managed to stop before 
hitting the car in front of us said mrs dawson my husband 
got out and i was trying to get out and my husband yelled get 
back in and brace yourself 
the whole back of the van is gone but after seeing some of 
the other people we consider ourselves lucky what a way to start

federal safety officials indicated thursday that 
failed brakes may have caused a derailment that sent an amtrak 
train slamming into a commuter train injuring 264 people 
an apprentice engineer operating the amtrak train told 
investigators he tried three times to apply the brakes as the night 
owl from washington approached bostons back bay station said 
susan coughlin vice chairwoman of the national transportation 
safety board 
it is his opinion that the brakes failed to set up properly to 
slow the train coughlin said at a news conference thursday 
night 
the engineer trainee richard abramson also told authorities 
that the senior engineer willis copeland tried to stop the train 
using emergency brakes coughlin said 
coughlin said time recorders showed the train was traveling an 
average of 918 mph over the last mile of its trip between the 
ruggles and back bay stations the two stations are about one mile 
apart 
before the ruggles station the train could safely travel 100 
mph but at the point where the train derailed approaching back 
bay it should have been traveling 30 mph coughlin said 
however coughlin said it was still unclear exactly how fast the 
train was traveling when it derailed 
the last time he abramson looked at the speedometer he was 
going between 60 and 70 mph coughlin said adding that it was 
still unclear what point that was 
it was the first time copeland had taken over operation of a 
regular train run authorities said 
the investigators worked under a temporary brace put up thursday 
to bolster the tunnel ceiling which ruptured when the amtrak 
engine jackknifed on impact 
federal investigators have conducted drug and alcohol tests on 
crews of both trains as is routine after crashes they also 
planned to see if the tracks conformed to the proper gauge size and 
check maintenance records 
they will also document what happened to the seats walls food 
equipment and other equipment on the trains to look at how they 
withstood the impact 
wednesdays morning rushhour crash in the back bay station 
injured 264 people fifteen people spent the night in hospitals 
four were still in intensive care thursday 
thomas glynn general manager of the massachusetts bay 
transportation authority said he expected eight people to remain 
hospitalized thursday night with one remaining in intensive care 
the national transportation safety board review will examine 
recorders to determine the precise speed brake patterns and 
throttle position of the amtrak train when it derailed and struck 
the stoughton line train as it sat on an adjacent track said ntsb 
vice chairman susan coughlin 
federal railroad administrator gil carmichael said factors 
generally involved in derailments include faulty track an 
obstruction speed faulty signals and human error 
an engineer has to have knowledge of the laws of physics its 
not a matter of being able to drive the train its a matter of 
being able to brake the train he said 
its pretty hard to derail a train carmichael said 
responding to published reports the train was traveling at least 
twice the 30 mph limit in station when it derailed on a curve 
coughlin said he was not prepared to saying how fast the train was 
going 
the amtrak train however was running about six minutes ahead 
of time glynn said 
all indications i would have had is that it was running a few 
minutes early glynn said 
coughlin said she was not disturbed to learn that an apprentice 
abramson 41 was running the train 
what well be doing is look at the training that was provided 
the apprentice engineer and deciding whether that complies with the 
federal administration guidelines on trains coughlin said 
sue martin public relations director for amtrak in washington 
said abramson started onthejob training this week she said his 
previous experience included three years as a hostler moving 
trains about the yard in new haven she said he also had experience 
on a train simulator at the illinois institute of technology but 
this week was the first time abramson took controls on a regular 
train route 
he was operating the train under the supervision of 25year 
veteran engineer willis copeland because of that amtrak has said 
it does not believe inexperience caused the crash 
abramson was listed in fair condition in st elizabeths 
hospital thursday copeland 53 was in stable condition at boston 
city hospital 
the trains drove through concrete and metal support beams that 
held up the tunnel roof cracking the roadway above 
three tracks were damaged and considerable wreckage from the two 
trains remained in the tunnel thursday 
the accident caused 31 million in damage to mbta equipment 
glynn said adding that amtrak damage was extensive 
a local subway running through the station was operating 
thursday crews worked to restore full service to lines from south 
of the city by monday glynn said

the big national debt clock slowly ticks off the 
trillions outside the shabby old building off times square where 
joe franklin dean of tv talk show hosts presides over the 
moldering chaos that is his office 
ive had a lot of proteges franklin tells an interviewer in 
the hall outside his office people who ive given exposure to 
most of them dont come back because i symbolize to them the time 
when they were broke 
the interview is in the hall because there isnt room for two 
people to sit down in his memorabiliacrammed cubicle leaning 
12foot stacks of 16mm movie cans show bills junk and thousands 
of record albums overwhelm the visitor 
see the incredible office sunday on a day in the life of joe 
franklin a droll ha the comedy channel special on a unique 
showbiz legend a charming eccentric and perhaps even a tragic 
figure of the medium that created him 
i think i did the first talk show in history he said i 
really think i did these days his show on new jersey 
superstation wwor reaches an estimated 12 million households in the 
small hours of the night 
he is a small man and his round plump baby face and elaborate 
combover hairstyle are unmistakable hes been spoofed by 
comedians blasted for smarmy unilluminating interviews other 
shows and hosts are far more successful 
and yet he has outlasted them all 
in new york city alone he said 400 talk show hosts have come 
and gone since he began 
i never had a manager i never had an agent i was never part 
of the machine he said if i was part of the machine id be 
worth 80 million today im the last of the mom and pop candy 
stores 
the united states was a creditor nation when franklin began his 
talk show in november 1951 the guinness book notes that on june 1 
1986 he presented his 21700th show hes probably put more than 
1000 in the can since then and reckons hes had 178000 guests 
that doesnt include his radio shows which began in 1948 as the 
nightly vaudeville isnt dead his weekly allnight radio show 
joe franklins memory lane still airs on wor 
people think im older said franklin 61 when i was 25 
people thought i was 50 because i was doing nostalgia i meet 
people 90 years old tell me that they were fans of mine when they 
were a kid 
he surveys his packed room this is a hundredth of what i 
own he said estimating his collection at 50000 discs 10000 
classic and silent films and enough unclassifiable memorabilia to 
verge on character disorder 
earlier in the day he had appeared on the live with regis and 
kathy lee show with a shopping bag full of his treasured 
mementos 
a tumbler he calls wc fields shot glass a shoe of greta 
garbos a small pillow that eddie cantor used a lock of elvis 
presleys fine black hair taped to a photograph of the king 
getting a haircut 
some of elvis hair has fallen into garbos shoe a weird 
juxtaposition he very carefully retrieves it and tucks it away 
the two phones ring constantly he takes calls in a chair beside 
a ceilinghigh stack of bound volumes of the new york times from 
the20s and 30s a constant stream of visitors vies for his 
attention he speaks to everyone 
theres no secretary his retinue is a group of older men spry 
pensioners or fellows between jobs who answer the phone and run 
for coffee they greet visitors introduce those awaiting an 
audience and dote on their benefactor 
in his heart franklin said the year is 1934 rudy vallee sings 
brother can you spare a dime and bob hope is on broadway 
introducing i cant get started with you and smoke gets in 
your eyes 
i was 5 years old you know i would have loved to have been 
older in 1934 in the 1934 he has invented joe franklin knows 
where he is 
im going to vaudeville showe at the palace theater to see 
eddie cantor and ruth edding and jack benny and ed wynn and al 
jolson and georgie jessel he said every night 
for me the world ended about 1934 
 
elsewhere in television 
no hype the godfather on hbo the godfather family a look 
inside is reprised sunday on hbo its a mustsee for fans of the 
godfather movies and of director francis ford coppola 
it has some tantalizing and beautiful scenes from the 
godfather part iii but even without them the excellent 
interviews with coppola al pacino talia shire and james caan 
would make the hour documentary worthwhile 
as a bonus you also get to see martin sheens screen test for 
the role of michael corleone and robert de niros test for the 
role of sonny of such things are silver screen trivia made 
hbo is presenting the godfather on dec 18 and 21 and the 
godfather part ii on dec 19 and 22 the godfather part iii 
is scheduled for theatrical release dec 25

japans most revered author died in 1916 leaving 
his final novel incomplete and his readers wondering whether the 
main character tsuda would win kiyokos heart 
a writer who spent part of her childhood in the united states 
finally resolved the cliffhanger this year with a continuation of 
natsume sosekis classic novel meian 
for 74 years no japanese author had dared resolve the puzzle 
left by soseki a towering intellect his face adorns the 1000yen 
bill and his brain is preserved at tokyo university 
minae mizumuras audacity and her success in mastering the 
idiosyncratic japanese of the nations greatest literary figure 
have made her a sensation in japans staid literary establishment 
soseki is so deified that no one can possibly live up to his 
reputation mizumura a petite woman in her mid30s said with a 
selfeffacing laugh its natural that people would react against 
the book so no one wrote it 
her 373page first novel meian continued has sold 26500 
copies since its release in august good for serious literature but 
smalltime compared with hits that sell more than a million 
i figured many people like me would like to know how the 
story ends and since soseki is so famous i figured that at least 
libraries and soseki scholars would buy the book said mizumura 
a former lecturer in japanese literature at princeton university 
sosekis novel is about newlyweds who find after playing the 
doting husband and wife for about six months that they arent 
happy together 
tsuda a whitecollar worker from a rich family has to 
acknowledge he doesnt really love his wife whom he met shortly 
after being jilted by kiyoko the woman he does love 
he tries to confront kiyoko who is married and appears only in 
the last few pages of meian to learn why she rejected him the 
book ends just as his courage fails 
meian was written in sosekis gloomy later years and is not 
among his bestloved novels many japanese read the book in school 
however in addition to his more humorous earlier works 
even the highly educated consider sosekis japanese antiquated 
and difficult it relies heavily on unique uses of the chinese 
characters and sets of syllables that form japans written 
language 
young people in japan dont read books written in prewar 
japanese mizumura said its even rather difficult for college 
students 
she described her foray into serious literature as a 
contribution to reviving longdiscarded forms of more traditional 
japanese 
soseki was one of the last japanese novelists to use chinese 
characters to their full advantage to bring a text to life she 
said in an interview his use of the language is fascinating and 
its so much richer than that used today 
most critics applauded her for mastering sosekis difficult 
style 
ken yasuhara wrote in the monthly literary magazine gendaishi 
techo that mizumuras continuation is more moving than sosekis 
original 
she left japan at age 12 when her fathers company transferred 
him to the united states her higher education was in english and 
french but she eventually drifted toward her real love japanese 
literature 
she was a doctoral student at yale university and spent three 
years teaching at princeton in january she will begin teaching at 
the university of michigan 
mizumura said her status as an outsider gave her the courage to 
approach the task other japanese writers avoided 
i had no literary reputation to risk no set literary style 
she said i had no nothing to lose in giving it a try 
in meian continued tsuda is rebuffed after finally daring 
to ask kiyoko why she spurned him while i dont dislike you 
she says youre the sort of person i cant stand 
tsudas wife onobu realizes her efforts to win his love arent 
working and considers suicide 
having resolved one enigma mizumura leaves her readers with 
another will onobu choose life or death

singling out the federal reserve in particular 
investment adviser john winthrop wright declared this week that 
misconceived policies over the past two decades have foolishly and 
needlessly weakened the us economy 
the accusation is not a new one for wright who believes 
americas economy would function with profit for all and with 
little inflation if growth were promoted rather than almost 
constantly repressed 
thats what it used to do said wright who heads wright 
investors service an international research and advisory firm 
that handles billions of dollars of investments for banks 
individuals and others 
that view of course has put him into conflict with every 
federal reserve chairman in the past two decades all of whom have 
viewed the economy as a potential monster to be restrained lest it 
run wild and generate inflation 
as he has every year during that 20year span wright addressed 
the new york society of security analysts he is the only 
investment thinker who has been invited back so regularly 
he lit into americas economic leadership giving the assembled 
analysts a message they wont soon forget 
for two decades now instead of gearing fiscal and monetary 
policies to encourage production and investment weve pushed 
consumption and borrowing he said he said its led to the 
obvious we tried to have more than we made 
a great bear of a man with enormous faith in abilities of 
ordinary people now in his late 70s and as respected by some 
economists as he is by investment analysts wright was just warming 
to the thrust of his critique 
instead of preserving and increasing our capital strength 
he said we have dissipated it and destroyed the national savings 
and loan system 
instead of decreasing costs by encouraging wider competition 
we have ignored our antitrust legislation and fostered monopolistic 
practices 
and instead of enlarging the public ownership of american 
industry we have concentrated it in the hands of powerful 
supranational organizations and foreign investors 
while pursuing what he suggested was an almost mindless course 
us policy makers have eschewed legitimate economic growth while 
tilting at inflationary windmills 
the result wright said is that the widely acclaimed expansion 
of the 1980s was in some ways a time of terrible waste and 
developing weakness the 1980s saw the slowest rate of us 
economic growth since the 1930s he said 
many people might find that hard to believe since certain 
economic data can be gathered to rebut it but as with so much in 
economics a lot depends on the statistics you choose wright 
measured by the american worker 
the real growth rate in gross national product per worker was 
08 percent a year during the 1980s he said which was less than 
half the average of 17 percent a year for the four decades since 
1950 
perhaps the most discouraging statistic that i have come 
across in years he told the analysts is the fact that real 
earnings of workers in the nonfarm economy have declined for most 
of the past 20 years 
he did not spare the investment community there were those 
among us who led ivestors on a wild takeover chase during the 
80s he said while ignoring solid highquality opportunities 
in productive enterprises 
all those excesses of the 1980s he contends were made possible 
by or encouraged by improper economic policies 
is there a future a good one he said if americans can learn 
that they have a wonderful productive jobproducing 
lifeenhancing piece of machinery that they must run properly for 
all participants 
american workers can still be the most productive in the 
world if only they are provided with the proper tools and adequate 
training he said and us companies can compete anywhere with 
anyone if they have access to capital at rates low enough to 
encourage productive investments 
he insisted that investment markets must be delivered from the 
hands of concentrated powers and returned to broad public 
ownership which prevailed before the takeovers and sharebuyback 
programs 
and he reiterated his faith that the american people can and 
will kick their addiction to foreign capital but only if the 
nations policymakers provide adequate incentives for savings and 
investment

while the rest of america is plunking down in 
front of tv sets to watch parades and football games on new years 
day alice tauber expects to be well counting bottles 
im freaking out she says she smiles as she says this but 
theres a hint of panic as her eyes dart over thousands of bottles 
in the liquor store she and her husband ed have owned for 16 years 
you see all those bottles have to be counted so the tauberscan 
figure how much of the new federal excise tax theyll have to pay 
they wont be alone everyone who sells alcohol and cigarettes 
some 600000 retail outlets plus producers importers and 
wholesalers must count every bottle and every pack as of jan 1 
the day the tax goes into effect 
this is a onetime inventory normally producers and importers 
pay all excise taxes and in fact they paid the taxes on everything 
now on the shelves but those were the old lower rates so 
retailers must make up the difference between the old tax and the 
new tax on items still unsold 
once they complete the count and pay the appropriate tax 
retailers like the taubers wont have to worry about it again 
importers and producers will resume paying all the taxes at the new 
rate generally passing along the cost in higher wholesale prices 
the taubers extensive continental liquors store in downtown 
washington always closes new years day this year the taubers 
their 10 employees their 22yearold daughter and 21yearold son 
will all be working probably for 11 straight hours 
theyre dead if they dont show up mrs tauber said 
completing the inventory forms and determining the tax owed is 
not a job for the mathphobic 
although almost all liquor is bottled in metric measures 
congress taxes by the gallon the way producers measure their 
output in addition the tax on distilled spirits such as vodka 
and bourbon is based on socalled proof gallons meaning gallons 
that are 100 proof or 50 percent alcohol 
so its not enough for the taubers simply to count all the 
bottles of vodka there will be different taxes for a 750 
milliliter bottle of 80proof vodka a 750 milliliter bottle of 
100proof vodka and a liter bottle of either strength 
an information packet provided by the bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms which collects the tax contains three lengthy pages 
of sample computations plus a page of mindbending conversion 
charts that require multiplication by such numbers as 022915 
all this work should yield 300 million for government coffers 
by the end of june when the tax is due said atf spokesman jack 
killorin but it will be a challenge killorin said for both 
the retailers and the atf which must check the accuracy of the 
inventories and taxes paid 
john b burcham jr executive director of the 10000member 
national liquor stores association said the inventory comes at a 
bad time 
retailers are ending up the very busiest months when its 
make or break for the whole year burcham said the tax imposes 
a tremendous workload on retailers for which they get no return 
he said 
there are some exceptions stores with small stocks less than 
500 gallons must take inventory but wont have to make up the tax 
gap 
and the inventory will be easier for fully computerized stores 
the taubers store is not 
ed tauber couldnt even estimate how many types of distilled 
spirits wine and beer the store carried much less how many 
bottles were on hand 
thousands just thousands he said 
a count of the vodkas revealed just how massive the job is and 
the store has far more wine than distilled liquor 
there are 51 different vodkas including 750 milliliter and 1 
liter bottles of the same vodkas there are eight different choices 
of stolichnaya alone from the usual 80proof and 100proof bottles 
in two sizes each to the 90proof okhotnichya flavored with 
mountain grass and heather honey 
once the bottles are counted ed has to figure the appropriate 
new price for every single type of liquor wine and beer in the 
store 
the tax increases already are set 1 per proof gallon of 
distilled spirits 90 cents per gallon of wine excluding sparkling 
wine 9 per barrel of beer with 31 gallons per barrel 2 per 
1000 cigarettes and 1 per gallon of imported perfume 
but tauber says he cant simply impose a 25cent price hike on 
each bottle some producers or wholesalers may decide to eat the 
tax hike to keep their product selling 
when the companies dont tell him their new pricing plans

bournet huddleston says the 
persian gulf confrontation is about freedom although kuwait and 
saudi arabia arent democracies 
walter boomer jackie jones and others hope to right a wrong 
scott swindle and julie taylor figure its about oil 
jerome mcreynolds just wonders why 
a clear mission is essential to the success of any military 
operation but opinions about why they may be asked to fight vary 
widely among the thousands of gis in saudi arabia 
president bush has been at pains to explain the mission both to 
keep american troops informed and to hold together the polygot 
international coalition that has opposed iraq since it invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 
operation desert shield began at king fahds request to defend 
saudi arabia 
bush drew his line in the sand to protect the kingdom and 
the american interest in stable oil supplies to liberate kuwait 
and restore its emir check saddam hussein and free us hostages 
held by iraq 
since then there has been talk of destroying saddams military 
machine and his capacity for developing nuclear weapons forcing 
him from power and creating a new order in the middle east 
in november the united nations gave saddam until jan 15 to 
leave kuwait or face military action by that time the united 
states will have about 430000 soldiers in the persian gulf 
congressional opposition to the use of force has increased and 
bush said last month of the confusion over desert shields purpose 
if i havent done as clear a job as i might have on explaining 
this then ive got to do better because i know in my heart of 
hearts that what were doing is right 
if force proves necessary bush has pledged it will be an 
allout strike rather than the muddled incremental response of 
americas intervention in vietnam two decades ago 
this will not be another vietnam he declared this will 
not be a protracted drawnout war 
perhaps for most of the troops dug into the saudi sand the word 
from the commander in chief is enough 
i came over here because someone in authority told me to 
said lance cpl will french 24 of johnstown pa who serves with 
the 1st marine tank battalion ive got my questions but im not 
at liberty to say what they are 
bournet hollywood huddleston a marine lance corporal from 
los angeles said were all here to kick some ass lets free 
these people so we can go home and be free again 
generally the gis feel their reason for being in saudi arabia 
is to defend this islamic kingdom which has the worlds largest 
oil reserves about 255 billion barrels 
more than a few believe the whole gulf confrontation is about 
the price of gasoline and ensuring supplies of cheap oil for 
americans 
thousands of people are going to die if we go to war or if we 
get gassed said airman julie taylor 20 of lake tahoe calif 
i dont think a quart of valvoline is a good reason for it 
pfc scott swindle 20 of albany ore said i dont think 
its worth all our lives for oil and gas but its my job so ill 
do it swindle is with the 2nd battalion 7th marine regiment 
others feel the mission is to check saddams aggression and deny 
him nuclear and chemical weapons that threaten peace 
were here for more than just the price of a gallon of gas 
said master sgt jr kendall of the 82nd airborne division what 
were doing is going to chart the future of the world for the next 
100 years its better to deal with this guy now than five years 
from now one way or another hes got to be dealt with 
jackie jones a 25yearold army lieutenant from springfield 
va said the purpose is to show the rest of the world the united 
states is not going to stand for bullies trying to wipe other 
countries off the face of the earth if we let him get away with 
this who knows whats going to be next 
she serves with a patriot missile battery of the 18th airborne 
corps 
for some its a simple matter of right and wrong a feeling 
that runs from the top brass down throuh the ranks 
there are things worth fighting for said lt gen walter 
boomer 52 who commands the us marines in saudi arabia a 
world in which brutality and lawlessness are allowed to go 
unchecked isnt the kind of world were going to want to live in 
someones got to pay the price for freedom over here said 
lance cpl anthony uhler 20 of pontiac mich who serves with a 
marine light armored infantry company 
the reasons for fighting seem clearest among combat units 
closest to the kuwaiti border doubts are found more readily among 
those pulled from base offices to live in tents or the reservists 
and national guard members plucked from civilian life 
i actually dont know why were here said staff sgt jerome 
mcreynolds 39 of montgomery ala a national guardsman with the 
1241st postal unit 
the mission id really like to know what is it

the mails still slow the 
prepackaged food is monotonous and there are few places to unwind 
the flies and scorpions have not retreated before the biggest 
american force sent overseas in 20 years 
but staff sgt joe estes a 25year army veteran said morale 
after four months in the desrt is 100 percent better than in 
the dark years of vietnam 
theres plenty of griping and a universal desire to go home 
especially as christmas approaches but there are few serious 
symptoms of a demoralized fighting force 
the booze broads and drugs synonymous with vietnam are 
forbidden in this conservative moslem kingdom 
since american soldiers arrived to confront saddam hussein and 
his occupation of kuwait only a handful have been caught drinking 
there have been no reports of drug use or illegal fraternization 
with saudi women 
fragging the gi tactic in vietnam of getting rid of unpopular 
officers with a grenade or bullet is not even mentioned 
the draftees of vietnam and their hatred for the military 
establishment are long gone in 1990 the us military is a 
totally volunteer force 
many soldiers in operation desert shield admit they never 
expected to fight a war but they are prepared to do their job 
whether it is flying an f15 fighter firing a howitzer or washing 
uniforms 
youve got a more educated a more physically fit type of army 
youre working with now said estes a wiry 42yearold 
infantryman from nashville tenn who was in vietnam near the 
height of us involvement in 196768 
morales at an alltime high confidence is real high he 
said watching topoftheline m1a1 tanks rumble off the cargo ship 
cape inspiration 
brig gen steven l arnold assistant chief of staff in the 
army forces central command served two tours in vietnam he said 
the rmy had recovered from that traumatizing conflict and 
subsequent antagonism to the military 
this is as good a peacetime army as i think has ever 
existed he said i know people are saying the troops are 
complaining soldiers are always complaining about things but 
thats not an indication of morale 
as marine cpl ed walsh of las vegas nev put it if a 
marine aint griping he aint happy walsh 21 is with the 1st 
marine expeditionary force 
arnold said the key to morale is whether soldiers willingly do 
the right thing without being told and do it well thats 
discipline and a disciplined force is really a highmorale force 
when you have forces that are challenged and youre giving 
them the type of training that meets their expectations i think 
you see a lot of high morale you see it here 
one yardstick for morale is mental health 
weve had very little business said capt frank mullins 
54 of mobile ala a psychologist with the mental health unit at 
the us navys fleet no 5 hospital morale has been excellent 
from what weve seen people can complain a lot bitch and carry 
on but morale can be very high 
desert shield is the biggest us military operation since 
vietnam where us strength reached 545000 at its peak more than 
240000 american personnel now are in the gulf and 200000 more 
will be in place by midjanuary 
complaints in a force of that size are inevitable two of the 
biggest problems are monotony and few escapes 
this is a prison you cant go anywhere moaned lance cpl 
steven jenkins 24 of neptune nj a maintenance man with a 
marine air wing 
army sgt kenneth hetzer 32 had other complaints after nearly 
three months in a forward position with the 75th field artillery 
brigade soldiers had holes in their boots werent allowed to use 
the telephone and had to pay 3 for a block of ice 
walsh said that despite the griping were really locked on 
if war comes itd be like uncoiling a snake theres nothing 
that can stop us 
attitudes differ in front and rear units and between fulltime 
soldiers and the reserve and national guard units mobilized at 
short notice 
morale was very high and it got higher as we got closer to the 
kuwaiti border said rep robert j lagomarsino a california 
republican who visited the troops last month with a 20member 
congressional delegation 
the more primitive the conditions the higher the morale he 
said the people in the more primitive conditions are the combat 
infantry the combat marine forces that were trained in the desert 
so they know what theyre doing 
army sgt 1st class thomas melton 39 of florence ala said 
the guys up there know theyve got a mission down here its 
just sit and wait for your equipment to come in and get to your 
location its very boring to sit around waiting thats the big 
problem 
melton has traveled extensively in saudi arabia as part of the 
207th military intelligence brigade 
in the words of marine cpl carlin walters 21 of vidor texas 
the boredom gets pretty strenuous itd be better just to go 
ahead and get it over with 
the marines all in forward positions near the kuwaiti border 
and army combat units like the 82nd airborne division have 
reputations for high morale in bad conditions 
at the other extreme are rear units with serious problems like 
the 1241st postal unit from the alabama army national guard 
weve got a lot of soldiers ready to go home said sgt 
michael smith 32 of montgomery the morale around heres at the 
very bottom if things were different and we were civiians wed 
probably strike 
for most soldiers the toughest thing is not knowing when they 
will go home 
either an operation or a gohome date is going to boost 
morale said 1st lt bruce lake 29 of newport news va a 
platoon leader with the 24th infantry division 
with the usual gi diversions banned the military has tried to 
keep morale up with sports movies and music 
mail is the biggest booster 
mail equals morale lake said 
veterans like sgt estes who never heard a word of support from 
the american public while fighting in vietnam are overwhelmed by 
the flood of letters his countrymen send to any serviceman in 
saudi arabia 
many gis have found new pen pals including churches clubs and 
schools 
this place here is just what you make it said staff sgt 
jeanne kendall 35 of piedmont ohio an air force mechanic

alberto fujimori was a political outsider a 
man unknown to most peruvian voters until he surged in popularity 
and won the presidency 
many feared the son of poor japanese immigrants was unprepared 
to govern a nation bordering on anarchy it was said often that the 
military would throw him out within months 
since taking office july 28 however the 52yearold 
agricultural engineer has moved quickly to impose his authority 
without an organized party or legislative majority he has 
forged a close alliance with the army and begun to govern by 
decree challenging perus traditional power brokers 
president fujimori has described corrupt judges as jackals 
condemned congressmen as useless and attacked medieval roman 
catholic bishops who opposed his birth control program he also has 
heaped scorn on idle bureaucrats who spend their days reading 
papers or doing crossword puzzles 
in a recent speech fujimori said his election resulted from the 
same desperation that spawned the fanatical shining path 
guerrillas his supporters he said voted with enormous and 
burning anger 
my government is the product of rejection of being fed up 
with peru because of the frivolity corruption and nonfunctioning 
of the traditional political class and the bureaucracy fujimori 
declared 
in his first official act hours after taking office he fired 
the air force and navy commanders the air force chief had been 
accused of corruption and the navy was suspected of plotting a 
coup 
he put the army in charge of two ministries including the 
interior ministry which controls the police 
early in august he imposed drastic austerity measures to stop 
hyperinflation he sent soldiers into the streets to stop violent 
protests before they spread out of control 
in a meeting with foreign correspondents fujimori said of his 
critics what do they expect of peru that the disorder the 
chaos the social indiscipline continue or do they want a 
government that really governs that defends order 
newspapers have called him emperor for his authoritarian 
style fujimori says the criticism will not change him 
peru is in a chaotic truly critical situation he told the 
foreign reporters we must make deep structural changes and 
thats what were doing 
his attacks have struck a chord with a society tired of the 
failure of its political institutions polls indicate six of 10 
peruvians support him despite the austerity measures the severest 
in perus history 
one of his first targets was a court system infamous for 
corruption fujimori calls the palace of justice the palace of 
injustice 
he has begun releasing hundreds of prisoners who spent years 
awaiting trial in fetid jails judges say he is violating the 
constitutional separation of powers 
the president also has begun challenging the power of perus 
communistled labor federations 
in november he declared strikes by public employees illegal and 
signed a decree allowing the government to fire those who did not 
return to work the threat broke a strike that had closed hospitals 
run by the social security institute 
public employees have paralyzed vital services for years with 
strikes that won generous raises fearing the power of the unions 
previous presidents and lawmakers ignored demands for legislation 
limiting the right to strike 
if fujimori wins this struggle the benefits for peru will be 
innumerable and will flood in wrote manuel dornellas editor of 
the newspaper expreso 
fujimoris austerity program appears to be winning the battle 
against inflation which was 3000 percent a year when he took 
office the measures eliminated subsidies and price controls which 
were causing a huge budget deficit 
food prices shot up fivefold initially and the price of gasoline 
increased by 30 times but monthly inflation has fallen since 
august from 400 percent to less than 10 
during his presidential campaign against novelist mario vargas 
llosa fujimori pledged not to impose an economic shock 
program analysts say fear that peruvians might riot against harsh 
austerity measures may have led him to ally himself with the army 
in peru great force is needed to govern political analyst 
fernando rospigliosi said in an interview if you are going to 
administer an economic shock you have to put tanks into the 
streets 
javier valle riestra a senator for the populist aprista party 
of former president alan garcia said alberto fujimoris sense 
of realism has drawn him to the true center of power in peru the 
army 
fujimoris political skills have surprised opponents who regard 
him as secretive and unpredictable even his closest advisers often 
seem surprised by his announcements 
much of his power so far has rested on an ability to foment 
division among his opponents rospigliosi noted fujimori honed his 
negotiating and manipulative skills during years as rector of the 
national agrarian university a highly politicized environment like 
other peruvian universities 
analysts say however that fujimoris power base is shaky 
hes playing a very dangerous game rospigliosi said hes 
leaning on the military for support fujimori does not control the 
military theyre doing what he wants for the moment but tomorrow 
he could become their prisoner

rep william d ford was a 20yearold 
freshman at nebraska teachers college when his father died while 
working at a michigan automobile plant 
it was a heart attack the company insisted 
but the suspicious son crept into the plant interviewed 
employees and finally learned the truth upholstery had caught fire 
and his father was overcome by toxic smoke as he battled the 
flames 
that tragedy 43 years ago helped mold the michigan democrat into 
the passionate advocate of organized labor and workplace safety who 
next month becomes chairman of the house education and labor 
committee succeeding the retiring rep gus hawkins dcalif 
ford will relinquish the chairmanship of the post office and 
civil service committee which he has held since 1981 
he has been a member of education and labor throughout his 26 
years in congress helping craft legislation such as the 
occupational safety and health act 
he says many small nonunion workplaces remain dangerous 
despite improvements at large companies 
the cynical answer is that you cant have strict enforcement 
of safety regulations and jobs jobs jobs he said but i 
think you can 
ford refused in a recent interview to discuss his legislative 
agenda in detail saying he wanted to talk with committee members 
first but hes likely to reintroduce a bill that stalled this year 
to protect whistleblowers who expose workplace dangers 
he hopes for more money for education and job training but 
acknowledges his committee will have to focus on making better use 
of existing funds 
there are ways to improve the quality of life without spending 
a lot of money he said weve got to figure out how 
ford may seek changes in the federal student aid program 
plagued by reports of fraud as his committee undertakes 
reauthorization of the higher education act he says there should 
be fewer loans and more grants for poor and middleclass college 
students 
blunt and aggressive with a staunchly liberal philosophy rooted 
in the new deal ford is popular with labor unions and education 
activists who hope he can provide impetus for initiatives that fell 
by the wayside in the conservative 1980s 
hes one of our strongest allies in the house no doubt about 
it said keith geiger president of the national education 
association 
on family and medical leave civil rights plant closings 
bill ford has always been there for the average working man and 
woman said bob mcglotten legislative director for the aflcio 
ford is determined to restore the prominence the education and 
labor committee lost in the 1980s when its leftleaning democratic 
majority seemed out of step with the conservative times 
theyve been by and large a backwater in the congress as the 
focus shifted to the budget process said norman ornstein 
resident scholar with the american enterprise institute 
especially in the reagan years they simply havent been as major 
a factor 
ford believes americans are weary of overseas entanglements and 
billiondollar weapons systems they may not yearn for a 1990s 
version of lyndon b johnsons great society he says but 
there is a growing commitment to improving schools and fighting 
poverty 
id like to believe we can convince people that this 
meandmeonly crap is over and weve got to make investments in 
the future generations he said 
responding to a lobbyists plea earlier this year to support the 
b2 stealth bomber ford offered a tongueincheek proposition he 
would vote for the 800 million aircraft if president bush would 
request a tax increase to pay for it 
i am not going to put one more of these toys on a credit card 
that my grandkids are going to have to pay off ford snapped 
ford 63 the son of immigrants was raised in bluecollar 
detroit neighborhoods he served in the navy and was a city 
attorney and justice of the peace in the latter job he crossed 
paths with a young prosecutor named john dingell now chairman of 
the house energy and commerce committee and a frequent hunting and 
fishing partner of fords 
after serving two years in the michigan senate ford was elected 
to congress in 1964 hes since faced no serious challenge in his 
suburban detroit district winning his 14th term last month with 63 
percent of the vote 
a fater of three who was married for the third time this year 
ford is known for legislative craftiness and fierce partisanship 
that sometimes prompts complaints from republicans on his 
committees 
his tenacity was evident in his 14year struggle for legislation 
to require advance notice of plant closings rewarded in 1988 when 
congress overrode president reagans veto of a closure bill 
ford isnt related to the founder of the automobile company of 
the same name but his loyalty to the industry that employs 
thousands of his constituents was evident this month 
he decreed that the 50 capitol hill parking spaces reserved for 
education and labor staffers were offlimits to foreign cars

in the distant snowy hindu kush of 
afghanistan the mountain stillness is broken by the rockets bombs 
and bullets of a leftover war against a faded ideology 
we will fight until communism is gone from our country said 
gulzaman tahidyar a 21yearold guerrilla we will bring islam 
to afghanistan 
we will live in the desert we will live in the mountains but 
we will never accept communism said tahidyar the anticommunist 
slogans of the early 1980s tumbling out 
the young warrior prepared to return to the mountains as he has 
for eight years but time has passed him by the enemy he fought so 
hard for so long isnt really there anymore 
soviet troop convoys that rumbled through his homeland for 
nearly a decade have been gone for two years in kabul the 
government has abandoned the marxist ideology it once tried to 
impose on a rural moslem people and seeks to cloak itself in 
islam 
like most mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors tahidyar talks 
more and more of fighting with the last drop of our blood less 
and less of victory or what it might mean the war now in its 12th 
year is no longer a clear ideological struggle 
when the last of the 115000 soviet army troops left afghanistan 
on feb 15 1989 the moslem guerrillas and their western backers 
confidently measured the kabul governments survival in weeks and 
months 
few thought the mujahedeen would even have to fight president 
najibullahs government they were convinced would collapse from 
within and the guerrillas would march triumphantly into kabul 
they were wrong 
twentytwo months later the optimism is gone disappointment 
and despair fill the driedmud refugee camps around peshawar the 
wild west border city that has been the staging area for men once 
romanticized as valiant freedom fighters who challenged the mighty 
soviet army 
in afghanistan little has changed since the soviet withdrawal 
soldiers loyal to najibullah hold the cities and the mujahedeen 
control much of the countryside 
with the soviets gone the world has grown indifferent to a 
country that seems except for an array of modern weapons still to 
live in the 14th century 
the united states and soviet union are trying to work out a 
facesaving exit from the bloodiest conflict of the 1980s it is 
expected to include a ceasefire transition government and 
internationally supervised elections 
on dec 11 they announced an agreement to stop supplying 
weapons to the afghan belligerents but did not set a cutoff date 
both have recalcitrant clients and no deal they make will 
guarantee peace history has shown the fiercely independent afghans 
do not accept political parties a strong central government or the 
tutelage of outsiders 
no one not even the superpowers can impose their will on the 
people of afghanistan this we can prove said gulbuddin 
hekmatyar considered the most ruthless ambitious and antiwest of 
the seven guerrilla leaders 
hekmatyar is said to have a twoyear stockpile of arms paid for 
by saudi arabia iraq and libya and cam try to spoil any 
settlement he doesnt like 
the most pressing problem for all parties is to find someone who 
can replace najibullah and pull the warring factions together 
najibullah former chief of the secret police has proved a more 
clever formidable politician than most people thought including 
his soviet sponsors the americans acknowledge the mujahedeen have 
no one to match him 
washington has dropped its demand that najibullah resign before 
elections but insists he transfer authority over the military 
secret police and official media to an interim coalition of all 
parties 
he has offered to give up control of security forces and some 
other powers if the major guerrilla groups enter negotiations they 
have rejected the proposal 
moscow still believes najibullah is the only person who can 
control the more hardline elements of his hezbewatan or party 
of the homeland which was the peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan until early this year 
najibullah has traded in loyalties risen with his rivals 
failures and used money and power to buy time for himself and his 
government he has brought peace of sorts to parts of the country 
by making liveandletlive deals with local mujahedeen commanders 
unlike the guerrillas najibullah at least pays lip service to 
the peoples yearning for peace appealing for an end to the war 
and for the return of nearly 6 million refugees from neighboring 
pakistan and iran 
he has admitted the mistakes of the april 1978 revolution that 
brought communists to power and tried to convince the world his 
government had changed but many afghans still blame him for much 
of the bloodshed the war has claimed more than 1 million lives 
we will fight najibullah and communism while we live if we 
die our children will fight said wali mohammed 70 if our 
children die our ladies will fight there are many children who 
have never seen their country but they will grow up to fight 
najibullah god willing 
most afghans may not accept najibullah but many also reject 
hekmatyar and the other six resistance leaders who have made huge 
fortunes off the war personal ambition and murderous infighting 
doomed a government in exile the leaders touted as the alternative 
to najibullah 
with time and american money running out mujahedeen field 
commanders have ignored their leaders set aside personal and 
ethnic differences and are coordinating attacks in what could be 
their last chance to win most observers say its a good idea that 
may have come two years late 
the biggest and most immediate threat to najibullah may not be 
the mujahedeen 
his economically strapped country still is heavily dependent on 
the soviet union especially for fuel to keep resupply convoys 
moving and the air force flying 
sources say the soviets who have severe shortages and economic 
troubles at home have told najibullah they cannot continue an aid 
program estimated to cost 300 million a month

and the soviets rejected the demand

supermarket an opaque window slid open small packages of 
pinkishgray sausage tumbled through it into a refrigerated case

scores of shoppers in a line under flickering fluorescent 
lights snapped up the packages as they thudded into the case 
the humiliating scene was duplicated at the other end of the 
meat department plastic bags of frozen beef kidneys were hurled 
from behind a sliding window to the 82 sullen shoppers waiting in

it is an insidethebeltway debate conducted 
in words most people dont use with a predictable outcome but no 
lack of noise in republican arguments about the new paradigm 
the g is the only thing thats silent 
beneath those conservative buzzwords republicans in and out of 
the administration have been arguing about proposals for president 
bushs jan 29 state of the union message 
theres a lot of phrases going around phrases like 
empowerment and new paradigm said john h sununu the white 
house chief of staff the fact is that they all come down to that 
fundamental approach of not having an overly centralized 
process 
in other words cutting through the bureaucracy to give 
individuals and institutions more power to make their own 
decisions instead of relying on management by government thats a 
basic republican theme and a guaranteed feature of the 1991 bush 
program 
the president says that centralized bureaucracy isnt working 
for the people who need government help 
sununu said bush would propose measures to allow individual 
citizens institutions state and local governments to contribute 
to the process again by unshackling them as much as possible 
a paradigm is an example or a pattern conservatives who favor 
the new one want to remodel government using incentives and self 
help the goal is to give people the power to improve their own lot 
by for example becoming tenant owners in what are now rented 
public housing projects 
governmentfinanced education vouchers would empower the poor to 
send their children to private schools if they chose 
there would be tax and other government incentives for 
businesses that opened operations in depressed city areas 
designated as urban enterprise zones republicans notably jack 
kemp the secretary of housing and urban development have been 
pushing that idea for years 
kemp has been chairman of an economic empowerment task force 
putting together proposals for bush 
james p pinkerton a white house policy aide assembled the 
new paradigm concept around proposals like those the package may 
be newer than most of its components 
nevertheless it has been provoking arguments for a month since 
budget director richard g darman sarcastically questioned whether 
the ideas were new or workable 
his boss seemed to think they were what were talking about 
here in this conservative philosophy is unlimited opportunity a 
vision to protect the family empower the poor and reward 
creativity bush said in a speech to conservative leaders last 
april 26 this new paradigm can fulfill it 
but darman stirred up the argument with a nov 16 speech calling 
the label a bit pretentious and questioning whether the ideas 
behind it would work on the most difficult cases government 
confronts 
at the same time in the real world others might simply 
dismiss it by picking up the refrain hey brother can you 
paradigm he punned that play on the words of the song 
brother can you spare a dime didnt go down well with 
conservatives who already were angry with darman over the tax 
increases the administration accepted in the budget deal he helped 
negotiate 
darman also said that many of the ideas now returning as the 
new paradigm vouchers decentralization empowerment were 
themselves fashionable in the powertothepeople 60s as part 
of the democrats war on poverty republicans advanced similar 
proposals reshaped into programs designed to shift power away from 
washington to lower levels of government closer to the people 
darman said such ideas never have been seriously tested or 
evaluated and should be he put the emphasis on management and 
said programs should be judged and financed on the basis of 
performance not fads 
rep newt gingrich rga the house gop whip and a paradigm 
man called darmans approach technocratic nihilism and likened 
him to michael dukakis 
he said darman should either withdraw the speech or resign 
darman did neither but theyve since discussed their 
disagreement to the point of at least temporary silence 
kemp argued the case for empowerment and federal tax cuts at a 
conference of republican governors who were more concerned with 
practical matters like state budget woes than with a debate about 
philosophy and a cryptic slogan the former pro football 
quarterback ventures a paradigm pun of his own 
i thought it had something to do with the nickel defense

of all the dark days last winter it is 
christmas that judy smith remembers best 
newly diagnosed with a mysterious and terrifying illness and 
wracked with pain she lay on the couch in her living room in santa 
fe 
i cried for two hours recalls smith 38 ive never been 
so depressed and so ill and so frightened 
nearly a year later as she recounts her experience with 
eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome she wrings her hands or rubs her 
aching arms 
she tells of pain no specialist has been able to treat 
incessant fatigue chest cramping and depression that led to 
suicidal thoughts 
but smith calls herself lucky 
twentyeight of at least 1541 reported victims of the blood 
disorder are dead others are unable to move their poisoned bodies 
or leave their beds 
nearly all the known victims took ltryptophan an amino acid 
sold as a dietary supplement until its recall a popular treatment 
for sleep disorders stress and premenstrual syndrome it was 
widely available in pharmacies and health food stores 
health officials speculate that a contaminant in certain batches 
of ltryptophan produced by a japanese manufacturer caused the ems 
epidemic they also believe far more people in the united states 
than have been reported perhaps as many as 6000 are victims 
more than a year after smith became one of the nations first 
three diagnosed ems cases much about the disease remains a 
mystery 
health officials dont yet understand why some people who took 
ltryptophan from bad batches got sick and others didnt nor do 
they know why some got sicker than others or why some have 
recovered while others have worsened 
weve got something brandnew that no one understands says 
douglas archer deputy director of the center for food safety and 
applied nutrition at the federal food and drug administration 
the contaminant apparently was formed as the ltryptophan was 
being made by showa denko kk one of japans largest chemical 
companies it has been traced to lots manufactured from october 
1988 to june 1989 and researchers are trying to determine whether 
changes the company made in a purification process played a role 
the disease is marked by an elevated count of one type of white 
blood cell the eosinophil symptoms include severe muscle pain 
joint pain and contracture rashes hair loss skin changes and 
coughing 
according to the federal centers for disease control in atlanta 
a study of the earliest ems victims indicate that onethird of them 
have improved dramatically to almost completely another onethird 
have experienced no change and the remaining onethird show 
increasing symptoms said rossanne philen an epidemiologist with 
cdc 
what it means is if this is an accurate representation of the 
population that is currently ill we should expect for quite a few 
people to be sick for quite a long time philen says 
it has been 14 months since registered nurse beth bybee of 
williamsburg va has been able to work its only within the past 
two months she has been able to reach behind her back to fasten a 
bra 
her left arm is contracted her left thumb is numb she tires 
easily and her skin is lumpy thick and tight 
a 40yearold former skier who did aerobic workouts several 
times a week bybee fears she may never be able to resume those 
activities 
i think thats what for me has been the most ironic the 
majority of us were very healthconscious she says the three 
patients i met while in treatment were my age very 
fitnessconscious doing good things for their bodies and 
thinking ltryptophan was an ok thing 
bybee took ltryptophan to help her sleep after it was 
recommended by a friend 
she ultimately found relief from the worst of her ems symptoms 
after a procedure in houston in which doctors removed her blood 
separated the plasma from the blood cells and returned the cells 
to her body 
treatment however has been a hitormiss proposition 
theres nothing that can consistently be said to be the 
treatment for the disease at this point says phillip hertzman a 
los alamos family practitioner who treated one of the first 
victims 
some victims have improved after taking antiinflammatory 
corticosteroids 
judy kody paulsen 39 of albuquerque credits her quick 
treatment with prednisone a cortisone derivative for the extent 
of her recovery 
in the fall of 1989 paulsen recalls that her skin and scalp 
were so painful she couldnt wear sunglasses or toweldry her hair 
today paulsen feels healthy although she worries about unexplained 
medical problems 
every time i wake up in the morning i say is anything numb 
is anything tingling is anything sore the first thought that 
occurs to me is oh no its recurring thats very 
disconcerting she says 
smith who recently moved to dallas says prednisone reduced her 
eosinophil count but didnt help with the pain for which she has 
found no effective treatment 
richard wurtman a professor of neuroscience at the 
massachusetts institute of technology describes ltryptophan as 
an accident waiting to happen 
in 1971 wurtmans research showed low doses of tryptophan could 
increase the production of serotonin in the brain making it useful 
as a sleep aid and for other purposes 
calling it a nutritional supplement was a fraud from the 
start says wurtman director of mits clinical research center 
theres no nutritional basis for giving tryptophan by itself 
marketing it as a nutritional supplement however precluded it 
from fda regulation under a 1976 law that exempts the makers of 
vitamin and mineral supplements 
the fda had determined in the early 1970s that supplements made 
of isolated amino acids could be dangerous especially in large 
doses and should not be sold without a safety review but the 
agency never successfully enforced its regulation 
now the fda plans to take another look at free amino acids used 
as dietary supplements the agency last month asked a contractor to 
study amino acids and similar products on the market 
once the results of that study are in and the mystery of ems is 
solved the agency will be in a position to decide if any changes 
should be made in the regulatory setup says the fdas archer 
wurtman believes ltryptophan and other amino acids should be 
sold as overthecounter drugs complete with dosage 
recommendations and warning labels 
like wurtman dyan humphries of denver believes the ems epidemic 
was preventable 
after ems left humphries 55yearold mother in severe pain and 
unable to move humphries spent eight months researching the 
disease she formed the eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome foundation to 
act as a clearinghouse and to provide support to victims 
treatment for humphries mother in a rehabilitation hospital is 
being paid by showa denko a spokesman for the company said it is 
helping some ems patients who require medical attention or health 
care but cant pay for it he was unable to say how many victims 
are receiving assistance 
showa denko has also provided more than 750000 in grants to 
research institutions to conduct independent research on the 
epidemic the spokesman said 
more than 300 lawsuits have been filed in state and federal 
courts by ems victims smith bybee and paulsen among them

duke university researchers are trying 
chemotherapy and heat to treat six ovarian cancer patients who 
havent responded to other treatments 
weve known for several decades that heat kills cancer 
cells said daniel clarkepearson chief of gynecological 
oncology at dukes comprehensive cancer center the problem has 
been learning how to keep the heat from damaging nearby organs or 
healthy cells 
patients in the program already have had surgery to remove most 
of the cancer and chemotherapy to try to keep it from returning 
clarkepearson said this is a secondline treatment used when 
the standard chemotherapy isnt working 
radiation and hyperthermia have been used to treat some types of 
cancer including advanced cervical cancer but this is the first 
procedure combining chemotherapy and heat the national institutes 
of health have renewed a fiveyear 10 million grant to the 
program 
ovarian cancer is such a difficult disease said dr jim 
barter an assistant professor at georgetown university we have 
to support any new and innovative approach to ovarian cancer 
ovarian cancer will kill at least 12400 american women this 
year it is the deadliest gynecological cancer with a fiveyear 
survival rate of 38 percent according to the american cancer 
society early detection and treatment can produce an 85 percent 
survival rate but finding the cancer early is hard 
even for women who get regular checkups pap smears an annual 
mammogram ovarian cancer is nearly impossible to detect until it 
is already in the advanced stages clarkepearson said 
the disease has been highlighted on abcs thirtysomething a 
series in which the character nancy has been diagnosed with it 
symptoms include a swollen abdomen and minor stomach upsets 
which many women think are stressrelated or indigestion 
clarkepearsonsaid 
in the new treatment the anticancer drug cisplatin is infused 
directly into the abdominal cavity the woman is then placed in a 
special hyperthermia apparatus where the drug the abdominal cavity 
and small portions of adjacent body tissue are heated to 1049 
degrees the average human body temperature is 986 degrees 
the hyperthermia treatment consists of microwaves traveling 
through plastic bags filled with saline that are placed in the 
abdominal cavity 
the patients are awake although slightly groggy due to 
antinausea drugs 
we know that cisplatin is the most effective drug we have at 
this time for ovarian cancer said dr james oleson who heads 
the treatment program we also know from studies that the effects 
of the drug are increased severalfold by heating it

the march of dimes birth defects foundation says 
it opposes criminalizing drug or alcohol abuse during pregnancy on 
the basis of risk to the fetus 
addiction is an illness and there is no evidence currently 
available to demonstrate that the threat of criminalization will 
deter addictive behavior the foundation said in a statement 
besides fear of prosecution may keep women who most need 
prenatal care away from health care professionals the organization 
said 
more than 40 such prosecutions are pending lori b andrews of 
the american bar foundation in chicago said at a recent march of 
dimes luncheon 
authorities in connecticut florida illinois indiana 
massachusetts michigan ohio and south carolina are among those 
who have brought cases she said 
newborns who test positive for illegal substances are legally 
considered neglected minors in florida illinois indiana nevada 
and oklahoma she said such newborns must be reported to child 
welfare agencies in florida massachusetts minnesota new jersey 
oklahoma and utah she said 
the march of dimes said drug abuse programs are largely 
unavailable to pregnant women and many programs cannot provide 
pregnancyrelated services 
the foundation recommended using community and governmental 
resources to attack the causes and promoters of substance abuse by 
women of childbearing age drug treatment programs that meet the 
needs of pregnant women must also be made available on demand the 
foundation said 
such needs include medical care child care nutritional 
services and help with education and job skills said dr reed 
tuckson the foundations senior vice president for programs 
the foundation said cocaine use by a pregnant woman puts the 
fetus at risk for miscarriage low birthweight neurological 
damage organ malformation stroke before birth and chronic health 
problems 
drinking alcohol during pregnancy can produce fetal alcohol 
syndrome which causes mental retardation the foundation said it 
can also raise the risk of miscarriage stillbirth and death in 
early infancy

if youve practiced exercised and stayed 
clear of the standard risk factors experts say you probably have 
no reason to worry about having a heart attack because of skiing in 
the mountains 
be aware they say that racing from the lowlands to the 
mountains combined with repeatedly dashing down a ski run in the 
cold can make your heart beat a lot faster than you might expect 
heart rates in twothirds of 149 men studied in vail colo 
were above 80 percent of their predicted maximum said a study in 
archives of internal medicine 
if you went to a cardiologist and said how fast do you think 
someones heart rate gets while skiing they wouldnt guess it 
would get up to 80 or 90 percent said dr robert f grover the 
studys lead author 
the experts wired the men with transmitters and measured the 
skiers heart activity as they headed down vails leastchallenging 
run 
the researchers wanted to see if skiing would trigger 
irregularities and at heart rates this fast they expected some 
especially in men over 40 who comprised two thirds of the group 
they studied 
they found however that the skiers stood up surprisingly well 
to the excitement 19degree temperatures and 11500foot altitude 
there were no more signs of heart irregularities in the skiers than 
in men of average fitness doing moderate exercise at sea level 
the researchers had predicted more in the skiers 
one possible explanation is that people who spend what it costs 
to ski in vail must be fairly dedicated and therefore probably 
healthy said grover an emeritus professor at the university of 
colorado school of medicine 
most of these guys were in fairly good shape he said 
middleaged men who are considering a ski trip to a mountain 
resort and who are not in good shape should get a checkup he said 
this especially applies to people with common indications of 
possible heart trouble such as high blood pressure high 
cholesterol a smoking habit or a family history of heart disease 
he said 
heart attacks seem to be relatively uncommon in skiing at vail 
said john atkins director of conditioning for the us olympic 
alpine ski team and a sports medicine consultant at the steadman 
hawkins clinic of the vail valley medical center however he said 
statistics may not be entirely reliable 
a lot of people will not have a major problem while skiing 
but will have one at the hotel or condo he said it wont get 
listed as a ski injury 
if you feel lightheaded or dizzy and develop a rapid or 
irregular pulse sit breathe slowly and try to relax atkins said 
if things dont improve after 30 seconds have someone call the 
ski patrol and let the professionals handle it 
he noted however that those symptoms could be caused by 
fatigue or altitude sickness 
in addition to a checkup pretrip conditioning can help to 
avert trouble atkins said at least six weeks ahead a skier 
should start a program of aerobics and flexibility he said 
on the slopes he should avoid fatigue by not trying to pack the 
most ski time he possibly can into his vacation he said fatigue 
also can lead to more common injuries such as knee problems that 
result when muscles are no longer up to the strain of skiing

next time the kids cram into the kitchen while 
youre cooking think twice before you shoo them away 
children are cooking more both because of the microwave oven 
and because they often are asked to start dinner before parents get 
home from work experts say getting to know the kitchen can help 
the kids too 
instead of coming home and grabbing a bag of chips they would 
make a baked potato in the microwave especially for snacks 
theyre willing to eat better said lois tulsty assistant 
manager of publications for betty crocker 
children who take part in meal planning and preparation are more 
likely to eat well according to the childrens television network 
creator of sesame street 
parents still are responsible for what their offspring eat but 
children are more willing to try things that they make 
themselves said vicki lansky author of kids cooking 
and teaching children to help in the kitchen is probably as good 
for the childrens selfesteem as for their eating habits she 
said 
childrens cookbooks are one way to get them involved the 1990 
betty crockers new boys and girls cookbook prentice hall 
press 995 is the fifth revision of its recipe book for children 
ages 8 to 12 
the first published in 1957 cost 1 and thats not the only 
difference 
yogurt appears nowhere in the early book in the new one its 
in five recipes including a vegetable dip something that doesnt 
appear at all in the first book 
the new book also has many more fruit and vegetable dishes and 
snacks with cereals and raisins cakes and cookies were more 
prominent in the first book 
even when recipes are retained there are differences both 
books have sloppy joes for example in 1957 theyre made with 
ketchup tomato soup and ground beef the 1990 recipe calls for 
celery onion pepper spaghetti sauce and ground beef 
brand names are omitted in the 1990 edition they are 
everywhere in the earlier book fewer cakes are made from mixes 
this time around theres no longer a chapter on campfire food 
in the 1990 book for the first time recipes come with 
microwave directions surveys and research have shown childrens 
use of the microwave oven is growing 
its viewed as safer than using the oven or the burners 
tulsty said 
but there have been concerns expressed about children getting 
burned from food that gets too hot in a microwave that splatters 
in the oven or that is not left to stand long enough after taken 
out of the oven the danger is greater for children who do not 
follow directions well 
both books are clear and easy to read while the new edition 
focuses more on healthy foods both try to make food fun cakes 
are decorated like igloos or drums or pumpkins faces are drawn on 
cookies or hamburgers pancakes are branded with initials and 
a a large star is made from watermelon triangles 
all the recipes have been tested at home by children tulsty 
said they give us feedback whether they would make it whether 
they like it whether they can make it if they have problems 
some food is familiar chocolate chip cookies and spaghetti 
for example but the recipes also include more exotic ingredients 
brie cheese curry powder dried herbs grits and quiche 
in addition to making children comfortable in the kitchen 
parents should teach their children how to read food labels and 
talk with them about advertisements for food lansky said

the vaccine researchers announced last year 
for a simian version of aids has kept one group of monkeys from 
getting the disease but has not helped after infection the team 
leader reported 
scientists at tulane universitys delta regional primate 
research center infected 30 monkeys with the virus half then 
received vaccinations and boosters while the est were given 
placebos 
after 11 months the vaccination did nothing to halt the 
diseases progression there was no difference between the two 
groups and half died including monkeys in both groups michael 
murpheycorb said at a recent new orleans conference on the use of 
monkeys in aids research 
i dont think its a setback she said im still very 
optimistic about immunoprophylaxis the technique like that 
employed against polio in which humans are protected against a 
disease before being exposed to it 
she said it should have no effect on vaccine research 
i am disappointed personally murpheycorb said it would 
have been such a wonderful thing to tell the human population 
because we have this large population that cant be helped with 
immunoprophylaxis 
the vaccine protected eight of nine monkeys from infection when 
murpheycorb announced this last year dr wayne koff chief of 
aids research at the national institutes of health called it the 
most significant advance in the vaccine field since we started the 
aids vaccine program

six of the seven endangered red wolves born 
on horn island in may will be captured by researchers and moved 
a male will be brought in to mate with one female that will 
remain on the island 
well bring in another male as soon as we get the others off 
the island said national park service biologist ted simons 
the horn island wolves are a successful part of an effort to 
rescue the wolves from the brink of extinction in 1975 only 17 
wolves existed in captivity the population has grown to 130 
the horn island wolves are some of the first in 15 years to be 
born in the wild and live in the wild 
theyve done very well simons said theyre ranging over 
the whole island eating mostly rabbit 
theres a 50 percent chance that another family of red wolves 
will be born in the spring simons said 
the wolves have had a beneficial effect on the island reducing 
the number of nutria and rabbits which eat the islands 
vegetation 
the young wolves weighing 50 to 60 pounds will be taken to a 
wildlife preserve in south carolina where scientists hope to 
establish a permanent wolf population simons said 
horn island will be used as a breeding ground for wolves for 
three more years but it is not large enough to be home for a 
permanent population of wolves simons said

ten years from now its a good bet people wont be asking 
where were you on aug 2 1990 
but if an entire year can pivot on a single date then 1990 
turned on that summer thursday when iraqi troops rolled into 
kuwait and trampled a lot of assumptions about how the new world of 
the 1990s was going to unfold 
remember the peace dividend that was the big bonus that was 
going to accrue to society when the cold war had thawed 
remember 1agallon gas 
a lot of things changed after saddam hussein unleashed his tanks 
on a little oiligarchy to which most of the world had been 
paying plenty of money but scant attention but then it was 
already a year for rethinking old assumptions a lot of them didnt 
seem to apply any more 
they didnt apply to the soviet union which abandoned karl 
marxs dream and staggered not altogether happily into the free 
market 
they didnt apply to europe where the twain of east and west 
met along the rusted remnants of the iron curtain 
they didnt apply to south africa where some of apartheids 
tallest fences were torn down including the one that kept nelson 
mandela captive for 27 years 
they didnt apply to latin america where two former military 
dictatorships chile and brazil completed the transition to 
democracy 
and they didnt apply to the united states where people 
wondered what is art and what is obscenity what is the meaning of 
the words read my lips no new taxes and what is americas 
proper place in the world 
americas place at the dawn of the 90s was in panama where 
us soldiers were blasting manuel noriega out of hiding and into a 
florida prison with strategic rock n roll 
that kicked off a year of wars and rumors of wars americans 
fittingly sought lessons in the nations bloodiest saga the civil 
war which was revived on movie screens glory and television 
screens the civil war 
on the home front the economy rode to the end of a boom and 
then busted although government economists twisted their tongues 
every which way to avoid using the dreaded rword recession the 
dow jones industrial average crested at a fraction below 3000 in 
july and slid slowly downhill from there 
but nobody needed the dow to read the end of the highrolling 
80s the greed decade imploded in 1990 when donald trump had to 
be hauled out of a 65 million hole when junk bond king michael 
milken was dethroned in a federal fraud case and his company 
drexel burnham lambert went belly up when taxpayers got their 
bill for the savings and loan debacle a cool 500 billion 
including interest 
people have a hard time comprehending greed at so large a 
scale rep jim leach of iowa said of the sampl scandal 
people also had a hard time comprehending the difference between 
taxes and revenue increases president bush won the 1990 
doublespeak award from the national council of teachers of english 
for being against the former and in favor of the latter no matter 
taxpayers understood that revenue increases would cost them 
just as much as taxes and they didnt like it 
at midterm elections voters grumbled and groused and then 
returned most of the same old faces to office but most people 
didnt even bother to vote in china the american elections were 
held up as an example of the failures of democracy 
other cracks also showed in the american mosaic despite small 
signs of progress in the national drug war drug abuse and the 
violence attending it continued to erode the quality of life in 
many cities new yorkers despaired over children killed in the 
crossfire of drug battles washington mayor marion barry was 
convicted of cocaine possession and sentenced to prison 
battle lines formed along the boundaries between art and 
pornography music and obscenity 
the photographs of the late robert mapplethorpe by turns 
sensuous and shocking were at the center of a fight that pitted 
religious fundamentalists and political conservatives against civil 
libertarians and artists 
the battle came to a head in a courtroom in cincinnati where 
jurors acquitted a museum director of obscenity charges for

southland corp parent of the 7eleven retail 
chain is hoping to make a quick trip through bankruptcy court and 
has lined up some convenient allies 
southland with annual sales of almost 8 billion filed a 
prepackaged chapter 11 bankruptcy plan on oct 24 the 
dallasbased company is the largest of a handful of troubled 
companies that have sought to streamline their time under court 
supervision with a reorganization approved by most creditors ahead 
of time 
typically a company files for chapter 11 protection and then 
presents a judge with a reorganization plan that must be approved 
by creditors a timeconsuming process 
attorneys for southland and creditors who have approved the plan 
will argue its merits before us bankruptcy judge harold abramson 
on friday some related issues regarding the sale of a dallas 
skyscraper southland built are to be argued before abramson next 
week 
southland officials believe prepackaging will allow the company 
to get through the bankruptcy within six months 
if we are able to get our plan confirmed by the court then we 
would be out in a relatively short period of time and that would 
benefit our business said cecilia stubbs norwood a southland 
spokeswoman 
in prepackaging the reorganization must be approved by at least 
half of the bondholders holding at least twothirds of the debt if 
a judge approves the terms of the plan are then imposed on the 
dissenting minority 
that makes prepackaging a powerful weapon for creditors against 
the holdouts who will never approve a companys reorganization 
plan hoping instead to wait for separate often better terms 
the prepackaged plan is a nice balanced way of giving 
creditors say so in the future and permitting the company to 
reorganize in a rapid efficient way said dallas attorney mark 
macdonald who helped republic health corp reorganize in such a 
way 
prepackaging is seeing greater use since merv griffins resorts 
international inc used a form of it last year donald trump is 
using a prepackaged plan in the restructuring announced this month 
of his taj mahal casino letteringmachine maker kroy inc of 
scottsdale ariz has also filed a prepackaged bankruptcy 
proposal 
republic a dallasbased owner of 14 hospitals filed a 
prepackaged chapter 11 plan last december to restructure debt it 
took on in a 1986 leveraged buyout republic emerged from 
bankruptcy in april and earned a profit during the last quarter of 
its fiscal 1990 which ended august 31 
southland sought protection from creditors have failing to get 
enough bondholders to go along with a restructuring required to 
help deal with the debt accumulated in a 49 billion leveraged 
buyout in 1987 the company said it would not be able to meet 
obligations next year if the debt wasnt restructured 
southland first proposed a restructuring last march when it 
announced the sale of most of the company to itoyokado co ltd 
and seveneleven japan co ltd its japanese affiliates the 
buyers would provide 430 in new cash for stock in the reorganized 
company 
the bankruptcy plan is similar to this restructuring which 
failed to gain acceptance by 95 percent of southland bondholders 
although a majority signed on making the prepackaging option 
feasible 
companies with operational problems or strife between many 
creditors could not use prepackaging to reorganize said new york 
bankruptcy attorney steven r gross who also represented republic 
health 
there are also dangers in prepackaging such as a mistake being 
made outside the courts view and then not detected until a judges 
only alternative is to order a new filing 
but a prepackaged bankruptcy may give a restructuring company a 
boost before a judge gross said 
a bankruptcy judge looking at a prepackaged plan or taking the 
risk of two or three years of bankruptcy for a company the 
judge is going to err on the side of getting that company out 
gross said 
if everyone is sitting there saing lets go thats very 
hard to resist he said

columbia savings amp loan association has filed a 
6 billion civil lawsuit accusing michael milken and other former 
drexel burnham lambert inc officials of fraudulently peddling junk 
bonds in the 1980s 
the lawsuit filed wednesday by the failing savings and loan 
claims that milken and others manipulated and coerced columbia and 
other thrifts into buying billions of dollars worth of the risky 
highyield bonds 
absent such deceit and manipulations it would have been clear 
that the market for junk bonds was highly illiquid and that junk 
bonds were unsuitable investments for savings and loan 
institutions the suit says 
columbia once was a major drexel customer it holds a junk bond 
portfolio with a face value of over 4 billion the largest of any 
thrift milken had a close business relationship with former 
columbia chairman thomas spiegel who resigned last year 
milken the former head of drexels beverly hills califbased 
junk bond department was sentenced last month to 10 years in 
prison for six felonies related to illegal trading practices none 
of the charges involved junk bonds 
the lawsuit by columbia filed in us district court in los 
angeles names milken nine other drexel officials and more than 
100 investment partnerships sponsored by the collapsed wall street 
firm 
it alleges that the thrift lost more than 2 billion on 
investments in junk bonds and seeks three times that amount under 
federal racketeering and antitrust laws 
columbia based in beverly hills said in the lawsuit that 
milken and other drexel officials manipulated coerced and deceived 
the thrift by promising that the market for the bonds would remain 
active and the thrift would make money 
in a statement a spokesman for milken said the lawsuit was 
without merit the statement said columbia was an independent 
institution that made its own investment decisions often in 
disagreement with milken 
it is outrageous now to blame michael milken for losses as a 
result of strategies and decisions that were implemented long after 
he was no longer active at drexel burnham lambert and which he did 
not endorse or agree with the statement said 
milken resigned from drexel last year but the statement said he 
had gradually reduced his daytoday activity after he was linked 
to the governments wall street investigation in late 1986 
it said the lawsuit amounts to shifting the blame to the most 
convenient scapegoat on the financial scene michael milken who 
has been blamed for every problem facing the us economy except 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
the lawsuit joins scores of other civil complaints against 
milken for alleged wrongdoing related to his guilty plea as well as 
other trading activity during his tenure at drexel which is now in 
federal bankruptcy court proceedings 
the 176page lawsuit by columbia also claims that milken and 
other drexel employees appropriated stock in buyouts for themselves 
via the investment partnerships that should have gone to junk bond 
buyers in the deals 
the suit accuses milken and others of manipulating the junk bond 
market giving bribes and stock investment opportunities to some 
thrift executives misappropriating valuable stock interests in 
junk bond deals skimming profits from junk bond trading and 
controlling through illegal means a web of thrifts and other 
investors in junk bonds 
columbia was one of many savings and loans big investors and 
other institutions that invested heavily in deals financed or 
supported by drexel in the 1980s 
columbia says in the suit that its junk bonds have a total face 
value of 43 billion but that it has written down their value to 
25 billion to account for the decline in their market price it 
also says it has suffered actual losses of 200 million through the 
sale of some bonds 
the suit says columbia was illequipped to make use of 
relaxed federal laws in the early 1980s that allowed thrifts to 
invest in corporate securities such as junk bonds it alleges that 
milken and the others exploited this weakness 
the savings and loan is expected to be take over soon by the 
federal deposit insurance corp as part of the nations costly 
thrift bailout 
the fdic and resolution trust corp which administers the 
failed thrifts already have filed a claim for 45 billion against 
drexel in federal bankruptcy court alleging that fraudulent junk 
bond dealings caused columbia heavy losses 
also named in the milken lawsuit are former drexel chief 
executive frederick joseph milkens brother lowell also a former 
drexel executive peter ackerman drexels former chief of capital 
markets and other officials 
as part of his settlement of criminal and civil charges by the 
government milken has agreed to place 400 million in a fund to 
compensate investors harmed by his actions but he would remain 
liable for awards exceeding the amount in the fund

the yearlong slowdown in the us auto industry 
will continue into the first half of next year but the business 
may begin picking up in mid1991 if war doesnt break out in the 
mideast auto executives say 
in separate briefings wednesday general motors corp and ford 
motor co officials forecast industrywide car and truck sales of 
about 135 million vehicles next year down from about 142 million 
this year 
if the 135 million figure proves true 1991 will be worst year 
for us vehicle sales since 1983 when the industry was coming out 
of the dismal days of the early 1980s 
the predicted sales downturn coupled with forecasts of poor 
fourthquarter financial results by carmakers and severe cuts in 
production have prompted wall street analysts to say gm ford and 
chrysler corp are in a recession 
most of the lost profits and problems faced y the big three are 
in north america where they do the bulk of their business but on 
wednesday gm chairman robert stempel and ford president philip 
benton predicted things will begin turning up in a few months 
north america will begin to break into the black stempel 
said adding that it depends on what happens in the middle east 
earlier in the day benton made similar comments 
we see continued weakness in the first half of next year 
followed by moderate recovery if the mideast situation can be 
resolved benton and ford chairman harold poling said in a joint 
statement 
since the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait which sent oil prices 
skyrocketing and put a chill on an already cool us auto industry 
the big three have been wrestling with uncertainty in the 
marketplace 
gm president lloyd reuss said automakers would be hurt in 1991 
not only by a soft us economy but by lower production due to a 
previously announced reduction in assembly line speeds next month 
and various plants being shut down for model changeovers in 1991 
gm the worlds largest automaker has set an aggressive 
newproduct introduction schedule for next year with a variety of 
new cars and trucks due in dealer showrooms including a revamped 
pontiac grand prix cadillac seville and fullsize chevrolet blazer 
sportutility vehicle 
the downturn the industry finds itself in today started about 14 
months ago when the car and truck sales began hitting the skids 
benton said the industry was beginning to show signs that it was 
coming out of the downturn just before the mideast crisis erupted 
despite the forecast of an overall downturn in sales benton 
said he expected fords share of the domestic market to grow in 
1991 from 1990s expected share of about 23 percent 
he also said ford expected japanese automakers to boost their 
share of the us market next year from their current share of 
about 24 percent benton declined to say who would lose share to 
ford 
stempel declined to estimate gms market share for next year 
other than to say that gaining even a tenth of a percentage point 
in the market would be a tough fight 
on other matters 
reuss said the startup of gms new saturn corp cars has been 
slower than expected because of quality problems at the 
subsidiarys spring hill tenn plant the slow start has left 
some saturn dealers with as few as one or two cars on opening day 
and that has raised a question among some dealers about 
compensation from gm 
we have made no particular compensation decision yet 
reuss said 
benton and stempel acknowledged that there was pressure on the 
rich dividends both companies pay their shareholders neither said 
the dividends at 75 cents a share for each company were in 
particular trouble but neither guaranteed that the company would 
maintain that level of return on investment 
executives from both companies forecast the beginning of an 
economic recovery in mid1991 provided there is no war in the 
middle east

phillip smathers 
big stone gap va lost its local police sergeant two members 
of its volunteer rescue squad and four voices from the lonesome 
pine community chorus 
the chorus more lonesome than ever has canceled its annual 
christmas concert 
across america the deployment of troops for operation desert 
shield in saudi arabia has changed daily life in unexpected ways 
pushing spouses into new roles and removing key players who often 
wear more than one important hat in the towns where they live 
it also has knocked the economic wind from communities heavily 
dependent on reservists or on nearby military bases that are 
emptying out as iraqs occupation of kuwait drags into its fifth 
month 
the central texas town of killeen reeling from the callup of 
20000 of the 38500 soldiers from nearby fort hood has become an 
economic disaster area 
i feel the mayors of these cities across the country who are 
responsible for these people affected should have been briefed on 
what to expect mayor major blair said after all were the 
ones who pay taxes to support this operation we provide the 
infrastructure for these military people now that infrastructure 
is being shattered 
fourteen businesses have closed including six car dealers a 
steakhouse and two gas stations one of which had been in town 25 
years blair said business is down as much as 60 percent for other 
merchants rental occupancy is half its usual level and 1000 area 
homes are vacant 
the city and local college are documenting the problems and plan 
to use them in a plea for assistance to the us department of 
commerce blair said 
they can provide all these funds for acts of god disasters 
he said and nothing has been addressed with respect to economic 
disasters at the hands of the government 
businesses ranging from auto dealers to pizza parlors say sales 
are off by 30 percent to 80 percent in st robert mo a town of 
1700 near fort leonard wood in southcentral missouri 
thomas moore assistant manager of a local supermarket said the 
bases 25300 soldiers civilians and dependents formed the areas 
economic backbone the whole town revolves around the base he 
said 
the same might be said of hinesville ga where homes sales are 
down as much as 30 percent and many rentals stand empty since 
14000 soldiers left nearby fort stewart 
i think every business in town is affected realtor allen 
brown said there are a lot of people concerned 
among them is howard curley gainous owner of curleys 
barber shop whose 10000amonth business has been devastated by 
the loss of thousands of closecropped military customers 
its been terrible the first month it dropped to less than 
half then it dropped even more he said 
its the same story 3000 miles away at charlenes house of 
beauty in twentynine palms calif near the marine corps training 
center charlene luongo watched her profits evaporate as thousands 
of marines pulled out of the nations largest such base followed 
by many of their wives and girlfriends 
the way i understand it they went home to mama she said 
ive lost about 50 percent of my business 
tony jones has watched business fall off by more than 20 percent 
at the laundry and car wash he owns in hopkinsville ky near fort 
campbell which has deployed 17000 soldiers so far the sooner 
they return the better 
yesterday would have been too late jones said when you 
sit here and chart your business i think you realize they mean 
a lot to us 
in some communities individual departures have meant more than 
local residents might have imagined 
the trial of a man accused of murder and attempted murder in 
grand forks nd was postponed because his defense attorney was

operation desert shield wont protect the 
nations weapons makers from lean times or save thousands of 
workers from layoff military experts said 
give or take a tank here and a missile system there defense 
contractors say they are sticking by their gloomy forecasts and 
lawmakers still talk about legislation to help communities hardest 
hit by defense budget cuts 
even with a war the outlook does not necessarily improve for 
arms contractors 
to the extent that this conflict creates the outlook for peace 
in the middle east it worsens the prospects for major defense 
contractors said thomas lloydbutler an analyst who watches 
defense contractors for montgomery securities in san francisco 
the most immediate financial beneficiaries of the deployment of 
us troops to the persian gulf are small manufacturers of 
uniforms personal items protective gear and food the pentagon is 
spending billions on shiploads of sun screen cold drink mix 
desertcamouflaged clothing prepared meals and bottled water 
but theres been no comparable surge in orders for weapons 
manufacturers the predictions of lean times that preceded the aug 
2 invasion of kuwait by iraqi forces remain unshaken 
were looking over the next five years at a declining defense 
budget theres no doubt about that said pete schmidt an 
analyst with the defense budget project a washingtonbased think 
tank what desert shield has done is affect the slope of the 
decline its not going to be as steep its not shrinking as 
fast 
there have been some exceptions the land systems division of

11 billion in antiaircraft missile systems and will likely sell 
more 
though there havent been any additional orders for the new c17 
transport plane airlift was in short supply during the deployment 
to saudi arabia and the pentagon may increase its buy the planes 
are made by mcdonnell douglas corp with engines from pratt amp 
whitney 
pratt and the other major jet engine maker general electric 
corp may also benefit from new orders and maintenance contracts 
for plane and helicopter engines the desert heat and sand lead to 
frequent engine overhauls and replacements 
theres no doubt this isnt detrimental schmidt said 
theyre smiling theyre smiling all the way to the bank 
rey aponte of the army materiel command said that while theres 
been no rush of new orders for weapons thats being considered in 
higher echelons of the pentagon 
but unless a war breaks out bringing on the wholesale 
destruction of weapons and the need for new equipment and maybe 
not even then all youve done is slightly postpone how 
precipitous the decline will be in the defense budget said ron 
hertenstein research vice president at forecast international a 
connecticutbased consulting firm 
a war could actually hurt military contractors who are primarily 
involved in futureoriented research and development projects 
in a shooting battle you produce more of what youve got on 
line ready to go said schmidt the analyst with the defense 
budget project your modernization gets put on hold 
the defense budget project recently looked into the question of 
which contractors might be hurt by a persian gulf war contractors 
involved in the b2 bomber project and the advanced tactical 
fighter particularly northrop corp might lose heavily if a war 
cut into funding for the costly aircraft 
the costs and requirements of war might under schmidts 
analysis require a reversal of the defense spending strategy 
outlined earlier this year by sen sam nunn dga chairman of the 
senate armed services committee nunn said the pentagon should 
modernize weapons within a lean budget 
sen john warner rva the ranking republican on the senate 
armed services committee and a former secretary of the navy said 
the sudden cost increases of desert shield may be offset by 
contributions from foreign countries and by the decline of the cost 
of manning the nato front in europe 
the most likely beneficiaries of desert shield among weapons 
makers warner said will be those who make ammunition and 
missiles like martin marietta corp and raytheon 
one after another spokesmen for the major defense contractors 
said theyre not profiting from desert shield 
bob obrien mcdonnell douglas i dont think any hardware 
manufacturer has a surge in orders you cant just spit these 
things out 
alvin spivak general dynamics there hasnt been any 
immediate significant increase in sales of our products as a result 
of the mideast situation 
george jamison ge theres been no significant impact 
one official for a military contractor who asked to remain 
anonymous said the companys board is predicting further reductions 
in defense spending when the president proposes a budget in 
january 
if anything its looking worse the official said the 
pentagon as far as we know is in for more severe cuts

the multibilliondollar question at cbs inc 
over the past three years has been what would the media giant do 
with the fortune it amassed by selling most everything but its 
broadcasting assets 
cbs came up with a partial answer wednesday it said it is 
offering to buy back as much as 44 percent of its stock for 2 
billion 
cbs said it expected to begin a tender offer in the next few 
days of 190 a share for up to 105 million of its common shares 
or 44 percent of its 237 million shares outstanding the offer is 
expected to expire jan 22 
the announcement gave the companys sagging stock price a lift 
cbs shares rose 562 to close at 17550 in new york stock 
exchange trading 
the stock has been weighed down in recent weeks by cbss own 
dour earnings projections heavy spending on sports and program 
rights unusual costs for news coverage of the persian gulf crisis 
and a soft advertising environment 
analysts said the offer may appease shareholders who wanted the 
company to do something other than buy treasury securities with the 
3 billion raised by selling its recorded music division to sony 
corp its magazines to a management group and other assets to 
various buyers 
everybody has been saying what will you do with the money 
said john reidy media analyst for smith barney harris upham amp 
co this is your answer 
the buyback which will reduce the market supply of cbs stock in 
a bid to boost its price also will allow the company to repurchase 
at least some of the shares held by its late founder william s 
paley who died oct 26 estate executors told cbs recently they 
might have to sell all or part of paleys holdings in cbs to pay 
estate taxes 
analysts also said the buyback may set a floor price for anyone 
interested in buying the company whose once pacesetting cbs 
television network has struggled for three years to escape third 
place in the primetime ratings 
but cbs executives said that laurence a tisch its president 
and chief executive whose family is the biggest cbs shareholder 
with a 249 percent stake has no intention of putting the company 
up for sale 
in a separate development the cbs board wednesday elected tisch 
chairman succeeding paley in that post tisch will continue as 
president and chief executive 
the 190ashare buyback price is a 12 percent premium over the 
companys closing price of 16987 a share tuesday 
jeffrey logsdon media analyst at seidler amdec securities in 
los angeles said falling interest rates that threatened to cut 
cbs return on its sizeable cash holdings also may have been a 
reason for the repurchase plan 
even as it announced the plan the company had more unfavorable 
financial news for its shareholders 
it said it lost 55 million after taxes on its first year of a 
fouryear contract to telecast major league baseball games and that 
it plans to charge 115 million against its aftertax earnings in 
the fourth quarter to cover anticipated losses in the remaining 
three years of the 106 billion contract 
the company said earlier it expected a fourthquarter loss its 
first ever excluding a restated loss in the fourth quarter of 1986 
and lower earnings in 1991 
cbs also said its board would probably reduce its reqular 
quarterly dividend early next year from the current 110 a share 
under terms of the share repurchase offer cbs said the paley 
estate would tender all of its 13 million shares as would the 
tischcontrolled loews corp which owns about 58 million cbs 
shares 
spokesman george schweitzer said the company felt the share 
repurchase program was a better use of its cash than buying another 
tv station or making a large acquisition in another business 
he said the catalyst for the offer was the expressed need of the 
paley executors to raise money for estate taxes 
the offer is expected to attract far more shares tendered than 
the company will buy and cbs will buy a prorated share of what 
each shareholder tenders 
cbs said the relative percentages of cbs stock that the paley 
estate loews and others own wont change as a result of the 
tender 
this offer will provide cbs shareholders with the opportunity 
to receive a premium over recent market prices of cbs shares for a 
significant portion of their shares while retaining a substantial 
equity investment in the company tisch said in a statement 
if the offer is fully subscribed and the company buys 44 percent 
of what is tendered the paley estate would stand to get more than 
100 million while loews would get about 480 million 
tisch said that after the buyback cbs still will have 800 
million in cash and securities to finance current operations

donald trumps taj mahal casino 
resort has until friday to produce documents detailing an agreement 
that gives bondholders half ownership of the property in exchange 
for reduced interest rates 
representatives of the casino and its bondholders told state 
gaming regulators wednesday they have finalized their restructuring 
agreement but paperwork remains 
when you start to put together a document of this size issues 
will be raised said martin greenberg the attorney representing 
the investors holding the bulk of the 675 million in bonds issued 
to build the billiondollar casino 
commission chairman steve perskie who had set a wednesday 
deadline for the bulk of the documents said he accepted the 
statements by both sides that they have reached an agreement 
however he set a friday deadline to receive the documents he 
repeated his warning given at the end of the first hearing dec 3 
that delay could jeopardize the casino license of the taj mahal 
the commission is examining the financial stability of the 
8monthold casino which failed to make a 473 million bond 
payment due nov 15 state law gives the commission the 
responsibility to ensure each casino licensee remains financially 
stable and the power to take away a license 
the restructuring reduces the bonds interest rate from 14 
percent to 12 percent spreads their repayment date over 10 years 
to 2000 instead of eight years to 1998 and gives bondholders half 
ownership in the taj mahal 
trump who has not attended either of the hearings can regain a 
total of 80 percent of the ownership if he can repay the bonds at 
rates higher than the restructured 12 percent 
the casino plans to enter into a prepackaged bankruptcy 
agreed to by bondholders and leave chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
by spring 
wednesdays hearing started two hours late due to the 11thhour 
finalization of the transactions specific terms 
weve worked feverishly over the past week in an attempt to 
finalize the documents trump attorney nicholas ribis said 
ed tracy the head of trumps three atlantic city casinos and 
one noncasino hotel said after the 15minute hearing that the 
final sticking points were the definitions of the deals terms 
if the taj mahal returns with the explanatory documents friday 
the casino must then produce the overall agreement by next 
wednesday casino officials have said they intend to file the 
overall agreement by monday with the federal securities and 
exchange commission 
the taj mahal atlantic citys largest casino opened april 2 to 
great expectations that it would become the engine that would drive 
the recovery of the stagnant industry here the casino has set 
gross gaming revenue records for the city but has failed to take 
in the 13 million a day that analysts said it would need to break 
even 
the taj mahal also has stolen business from the citys 11 other 
casinos including its sister properties the trump castle casino 
resort by the bay and trump plaza hotel and casino 
trump castle faces an 184 million bond payment saturday tracy 
said he would not comment on the prospects for making that payment 
trump castle failed to immediately make a 43 million bond 
payment in june setting off an emergency bank loan in which 
trumps three casinos serve as collateral that triggered the 
commissions desire to examine the trump casinos financial 
stability 
the commission will likely look at the other two properties at a 
later date

the first time since the directors triggered atampts hostile 
takeover attempt a week ago by rejecting a 61 billion buyout 
offer 
ncr spokesman mark feighery on wednesday confirmed that the 
13member board was scheduled to meet today but he declined to 
disclose the location or agenda 
on dec 2 american telephone amp telegraph co announced it had 
offered to buy ncr for 61 billion in a 90pershare stock swap 
ncr directors unanimously rejected the offer saying they would not 
even begin negotiating the sale of ncr unless atampt offered at least 
125 a share 
atampt countered by announcing a 90pershare cash tender offer 
to ncr shareholders a proposal scheduled to expire jan 4 
the new york stock exchange halted trading in ncr shares about a 
half hour before the exchange closed wednesday after a news service 
reported that a third party had contacted ncr about a possible

sachs amp co a wall street securities firm to its lineup of 
lawyers and investment bankers fighting the takeover bid

seek another merger partner or a minority investor to block the 
phone companys bid

maker to bolster its own unprofitable computer business 
ian ross president of atampt bell laboratories atampts research

a classaction lawsuit filed by frequent fliers 
accusing american airlines of cheating them out of bonus flights 
could potentially affect about 9 million people the plaintiffs 
attorney says 
an illinois appellate court ruled wednesday that the plaintiffs 
can proceed with their lawsuit in state court 
the airline based in fort worth texas had sought to move the 
lawsuit into the federal courts airline officials contend federal 
law and the us constitution had preempted all action dealing 
with fares service or routes 
but the appeals court ruling rejected this argument 
state courts award damages every day in aircrash cases 
notwithstanding the fact the federal law preempts state regulation 
of safety in air travel judge william s white wrote in the 
ruling 
attorney michael freed said the halfdozen plaintiffs he 
represents didnt want the case in federal court because a case 
like this is much more likely to be moved more quickly in state 
courts 
the lawsuit does not specify the amount of money being sought 
but freed said the award could come to many many millions of 
dollars he said the suit could potentially affect all 9 million 
participants in the american frequent flier plan nationwide 
the plaintiffs contend american airlines on may 18 1988 
unilaterally instituted a retroactive reduction in benefits for 
people who had accumulated frequent flier credits 
freed said the plaintiffs sued after the airline reduced the 
number of seats available to people trying to use their awards 
making it difficult or impossible for people to fly when and where 
they wanted 
the suit argues that the change in the rules for the american 
airlines aadvantage frequent flier program constitutes a breach of 
contract and a violation of the illinois consumer fraud and 
deceptive business practices act 
there was no immediate word from the carrier on its next move in 
the dispute we are studying our options american spokesman 
tom stack said 
barring an appeal to the supreme court the case will return to 
cook county circuit court for hearings on the actions merits

soaring oil import costs helped japans trade 
surplus tumble 356 percent in november from a year earlier to 
227 billion the finance ministry announced thursday 
without the higher crude oil prices caused by the persian gulf 
crisis the trade surplus would have risen during the month because 
of an unexpectedly high growth in exports a finance ministry 
official said 
im surprised that export volume stayed so high despite a 
strong japanese yen said patricia kuwayama a vice president and 
economist at morgan guaranty trust co 
the trade surplus totaled 324 billion in october and 353 
billion in november 1989 
japans crude oil import costs ballooned 1237 percent in 
november from a year earlier to 457 billion 
overall imports measured on a customsclearance basis rose 
262 percent to 2342 billion while exports rose 163 percent to 
2569 billion 
japans trade surplus with the united states edged up 02 
percent to 357 billion ending 13 months of decline 
the ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
a dip in crude oil costs late in the month was likely to help hold 
down import figures in coming months because of the lag time after 
orders are placed 
but the slowing of the us economy will prevent the trade 
surplus from widening significantly because of a likely decline in 
demand for japanese products said chiharu sumita of ubs phillips 
and drew international 
sumita said automobile exports to the united states were strong 
in november because of the introduction of new japanese models but 
were likely to slow as that temporary effect passed and the impact 
of the worsening us economy deepened 
japan calculates its trade balance on a customsclearance basis 
in which freight and insurance charges are included in imports but 
not in exports

american farmers love the idea of selling more food to the 
soviet union under a 1 billion temporary aid program president 
bush created to help the soviets fight winter shortages theyd 
love it even more if it never stops 
elected officials from farm states and agricultural board 
representatives welcomed the move announced wednesday although 
some said it might be too little and too late to salvage a tough 
year for us farmers 
the presidents move did not come a moment too soon said 
sen david boren dokla the canadians and the french have 
already indicated they would use their heavily subsidized grains to 
capture the critical soviet market 
lets hope that this is just the beginning said senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan 
house speaker tom foley dwash said bushs decision will do 
more to bolster the spirits of pacific northwest farmers than any 
single decision of the administration to date 
don hutchens executive director of the nebraska corn board 
said the board has been frustrated over delays in providing credit 
to the soviet union he added that the 1 billion figure is too 
low 
that is not enough in our understanding of what the soviets 
need and its not enough to get us up to the level of what we were 
previously selling to the soviet union he said 
last year at this time the united state had sold 6 million 
metric tons of corn to the soviets compared with 420000 metric 
tons so far this year hutchens said 
steve graham administrator of the kansas wheat commission said 
sagging wheat prices were unlikely to rise despite the news 
if anything it possibly will stop its decline which is 
positive he said 
us rep dan glickman a democrat from kansas said the soviet 
union needs far more than 1 billion in credit guarantees 
if the administration wants to have a freemarket farm 
economy then it must make sure that farmers have a market to take 
advantage of glickman said extending credits beyond 1 
billion will help create that market 
this is good news for us farmers and a godsend for the 
soviet people said rep fred grandy riowa farmers are tired 
of being first on the list at times of budget cuts but last on the 
list during the consideration of foreign policy that reduces their 
access to foreign markets

opec ministers today endorsed maintaining 
high crude production to ease any oil shortages caused by the 
persian gulf crisis and pledged to sharply reduce their output 
once it is resolved 
nigerian oil minister jibril aminu said the accord which 
quickly wrapped up the cartels winter meeting that began 
wednesday should firm prices up and send a signal that 
people need to relax in a time of worry 
the ministers action reaffirms an earlier decision to suspend 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries production quota 
system and allow its 13 members to produce to their utmost 
iraq and libya had opposed the move by the cartel in august to 
produce excess crude iraqs delegate ramzi salman abdul hussain 
said he objectedto part of todays accord since his country did 
not go along with the august decision to cancel quotas 
the suspension in august was designed to help offset shortages 
caused by iraqs aug 2 invasion of fellow opec member kuwait 
the countries wanted to make up for the shortfall of about 4 
million barrels a day resulting from the unordered embargo on 
trade that has cut the export of kuwaiti and iraqi crude 
opec president sadek boussena said the oil chiefs pledged to 
go back immediately after the crisis to a supply ceiling of 225 
million barrels a day which was set in july for all 13 countries 
i have no doubt about this commitment he told a news 
conference at the end of the strategy session 
with superproducer saudi arabia in the lead the cartel has 
boosted production to around 23 million barrels of oil a day 
including only small amounts from iraq and kuwait 
saudi arabia alone was close to pumping 85 million barrels a 
day according to sources 
under the new arrangement saudi arabia and other overproducers 
would be required after the gulf crisis is over to restrain 
production to the level set in late july 
saudi arabias output limit was put at 54 million barrels under 
that agreement 
the ministers agreed to meet again in early march to take a new 
look at the situation 
speculation about prospects good or bad for war in the 
persian gulf region has sent oil prices rising or falling since the 
invasion 
prices for light sweet crude peaked in october at 41 a barrel 
they have since tumbled to under 30 a barrel on hints of peace and 
concern about an oil glut 
the average price of a basket of crudes monitored by opec was 
2625 a barrel monday well above its target price of 21 
at the start of the winter conference opec president sadek 
boussena criticized oilconsuming nations for failing to do much to 
ease the oil crunch 
instead of taking crude out of their inventories he said the 
rich nations appeared to have added oil to their storage tanks in 
case of a worsening of gulf troubles 
the meeting drew together all 13 nations for the first time 
since the invasion iraq and libya did not show up for the last 
meeting at which the quota system was suspended 
no friction was reported between iraq and kuwait 
rasheed salem alameeri the oil minister for kuwaits 
governmentinexile also attended the talks 
opecs members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

federal regulators on thursday charged 10 
brokers with bilking investors of about 14 million through 
fraudulent penny stock sales in a case that names only the 
securities salesmen and not their firms 
a civil lawsuit filed in manhattan federal court said the 
brokers conducted illegal trading at several firms using techniques 
that included pressuring investors to buy stock refusing to let 
them sell and promising prices to rise 
the complaint filed by the securities and exchange commission 
alleges the brokers made more than 270000 in commissions from 60 
defrauded customers and seeks recovery of all illgotten gains 
the salesmen worked for several penny stock brokerage firms that 
have been targeted in the past by federal securities enforcement 
officials the lawsuit alleges illegal trading practices from 1986 
to the present 
all the brokers worked at the garden city ny office of jt 
moran amp co which went out of business in february and is under 
investigation by federal authorities some previously had worked at 
the huntington ny branches of first jersey securities inc 
closed by regulators in 1987 and sherwood capital inc the sec 
said 
what happens is if a firm goes out of business these people 
just pack up and go somewhere else said martin a kuperberg 
associate regional director of the secs new york office theyre 
the soldiers in this thing and theyre not going to escape 
commission scrutiny 
lawyers for the brokers did not immediately return telephone 
calls seeking comment 
among the charges the sec said the brokers told investors they 
had inside information about companies guaranteed quick and 
substantial earnings from the stocks indicated they were not 
making any commissions from trades and pressured customers to buy 
securities 
according to the complaint one broker told a customer he would 
double the clients money within three months another salesman 
told by a customer that he wanted to talk to his wife about an 
investment allegedly asked who wears the pants in your 
family 
penny stocks are cheap stocks in companies whose shares are 
traded over the counter and not on any exchange their shares often 
sell for as little as 1 making them susceptible to artifical 
pricing and manipulation 
state and federal regulators in the last two years have targeted 
rampant penny stock fraud in numerous indictments and regulatory 
actions and business in the industry has declined two of the 
nations biggest penny stock firms stuartjames co and blinder 
robinson amp co closed earlier this year amid mounting legal 
problems 
the brokers named in the sec complaint are robert f hasho 
benjamin m hasho william x mecca robert b yule kevin b

us construction companies have eked out 100 
million in business under a 1988 agreement to pry open bidding in 
one of japans most exclusive markets a senior us official said 
thursday 
but thats only a fraction of the 25 billion their japanese 
counterparts have made in the us market and us and japanese 
negotiators are still far apart on how to close the gap said j 
michael farren under secretary of commerce for international 
trade 
it is less than we had hoped for but its better than zero 
which is what it was two years ago said farren in tokyo for two 
days of talks to review the 1988 major projects agreement 
the two sides cant even agree on whether to continue that 
agreement which sought to cut through a tangle of japanese 
restrictions on us bidding by targeting 14 japanese construction 
projects including a 7 billion airport being built in osaka 
us negotiators now want to expand the agreement to include 
access rights to all public works 
the japanese however consider the current pact adequate as a 
bridge to get some american businesses into the construction 
market construction ministry officials said 
if it is allowed to expire however farren sees dangers for 
already tense usjapan trade relations 
the japanese construction industry long has been notorious for 
alleged bidrigging under the dango system top firms consult 
secretly on bids preventing outsiders including foreign firms 
from getting contracts 
under us pressure during bilateral trade talks earlier this 
year major construction companies announced they were dissolving 
an executive fraternizing group at which such activities supposedly 
occurred but accusations against such companies continue to 
surface 
farren said that since the 1988 agreement to open the market at 
least 12 us firms have received licenses to bid on japanese 
construction projects in addition us companies are involved in 
more than 20 joint ventures 
at the same time however us companies have spent an 
estimated 10 million getting licenses he said and if successful 
bidding continues to be an uphill climb for them theyre going 
to conclude it doesnt pay to invest in the japanese market 
farren cited a recent controversial decision by the osaka 
airport project to accept a bid for a peoplemover by a japanese 
company with no prior experience the airport coordinators rejected 
a bid by aegwestinghouse which has installed the equipment in 
airports throughout the world 
just before talks on the agreement began on wednesday the 
airport announced that bidding for its baggage system had been won 
by a consortium that included a us company but farren said he 
took small comfort in the announcement 
i dont find it to be much of a coincidence farren said 
clearly there was an effort to quell the waters with an award to 
an american company 
provisions in the us 1988 omnibus trade act call for a 
decision by may 1991 on whether to begin retaliatory action against 
japan if farrens review fails to deem japans construction market 
sufficiently open to us companies

opec ministers pledged thursday to keep 
their oil taps wide open during the persian gulf crisis but turn 
them down once it ends 
the agreement by the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries caused little stir in the oil markets which 
have been skittish for months over tensions in the oilrich gulf 
what is happening in iraq still means something for prices 
but not this meeting said peter bogin associate director for 
oil markets at cambridge energy research associates in paris 
peter gignoux head of international energy at lehman brothers 
international in london also shrugged off the meeting as no big 
deal 
indeed light sweet crude the benchmark american grade of crude 
oil was up 125 at 2660 a barrel late thursday on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
oil prices soared to as high as 41 a barrel after the iraqi 
invasion on fears of an outbreak of war in the gulf and a shutdown 
of oil facilities 
opec ministers agreed in august to suspend their quota system 
and increase pumping to make up for 4 million barrels of lost iraqi 
and kuwaiti crude the oil was removed from the market because of 
an international embargo against iraq 
prices have slipped recently because of hints of a peaceful 
resolution to the iraqi invasion of kuwait and worries about an 
impending oil glut 
despite high production levels the opec ministers decided this 
week to continue allowing countries with spare capacity to produce 
as much as possible to offset losses caused by the crisis 
but they also pledged to reduce output as soon as the crisis is 
settled returning to a production level of 225 million barrels a 
day set last july 
i have no doubt about this commitment opec president sadek 
boussena told a news conference at the end of the groups winter 
conference 
saudi arabia the worlds largest crude exporter is close to 
supplying 85 million barrels a day compared to its previous 
ceiling of 54 million barrels a day 
venezuela the united arab emirates nigeria iran and libya are 
also pumping extra oil 
in all opecs current production is tagged at around 23 million 
barrels a day and unlikely to go much higher 
we are producing more or less at the maximum level said 
boussena the algerian mines minister 
by promising to lower production when the crisis subsides the 
ministers are hoping to avoid a sharp plunge in prices 
indonesian oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita predicted that if 
the cartel holds to a level of 225 million barrels a day in the 
spring and summer we wont see a crash in prices 
the ministers did not give any sign that they would knock down 
their target price once the crisis ends that target was set in 
july at 21 a barrel 
however rasheed salem alameeri oil minister for kuwaits 
governmentinexile indicated that after the crisis his country 
might seek concessions from opec to pump more crude to restore its 
oil industry 
he said iraqi invaders had badly damaged and looted the 
industry but he contended it could return to normal production 
within several weeks of a peaceful outcome 
i would hope that other members of opec would consider our 
special case and would allow us a fair quota he told a news 
conference 
the meeting marked the first time that all 13 nations had 
gathered since the iraqi invasion ministers insisted the atmoshere 
was friendly and no angry words were exchanged 
iraq in a letter to boussena did express reservations about 
the presence of a kuwaiti delegation alameeri wrote a strongly 
worded letter in return defending his seat at the table 
meanwhile iraqs delegate ramzi salman abdul hussain said he 
objected to wording in the new accord that continued the august 
suspension of the output quota system 
he said iraq could not go along with it because his country did 
not attend the august meeting at which the quotas were suspended 
but others noted iraq was not affected anyway because its oil is 
embargoed 
the ministers announced they will meet again on march 11 for a 
fresh look at the situation they will open their summer conference 
on june 4 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

thursday on the chicago board of trade as the market reacted 
negatively to the size of the export credits granted to the soviet 
union 
traders were disappointed with the 500 million to 1 billion in 
export credits given the soviets the market had been expecting at 
least 15 billion in credits would be given the soviets said 
william biedermann an analyst with allendale inc in chicago 
biedermann said the market had been led to believe that credits 
totalling 15 billion to 3 billion would be given to the soviets 
in granting the credits president bush lifted a 15year ban on 
such credits the ban was imposed because of the soviet prohibition 
of free emigration 
wheat futures were able to come off their lows for the day on 
talk the soviets would make wheat purchases a priority there were 
also reports china may soon enter the market 
soyoil prices received a boost on news the us state department 
has approved the awarding of 275 million in export credits to 
pakistan the granting of credits had been held up while an 
investigation was made into pakistans nuclear weapons capability 
it was determined such capability does not exist 
at the close wheat was cent to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 254 a bushel corn was 2 
cents to 4 cents lower with december at 223 a bushel oats were 1

spiraling workers compensation costs will take 
a toll on us employers to the tune of about 60 billion this 
year double what it took to pay for jobrelated injuries just five 
years ago according to a study released thursday 
higher medical costs are the driving force behind the rise 
according to a recent survey of 576 medium to largesized 
companies conducted by tillinghast a consulting unit of towers 
perrin medical costs account for roughly 40 percent of overall 
workers compensation expenses 
also spurring costs are the increasing involvement of attorneys 
the exodus of private insurance companies from the market and a 
widening definition of what constitutes a workplace injury said 
jerry miccolis a tillinghast vice president who presented the 
report at a press conference 
mental stress and repetitive motion disorders emerged as new and 
widespread claims during the 1980s and employers surveyed said 
they expect psychological disorders as well as injuries associated 
with the use of video display terminals to increase substantially 
in the coming decade miccolis said 
miccolis cited a case recently won by a woman who complained 
about her inability to cope with a multiethnic environment as 
one example of what has come to constitute psychological 
stress 
nearly 70 percent of the companies polled said workers 
compensation costs are beginning to take a toll on their financial 
results and 35 percent said they expect costs to be out of 
control in the next five years 
because workers compensation rules vary from state to state 40 
percent of companies surveyed said they consider the cost of a 
states system before deciding where to locate their operations 
that factor is considered by 56 percent of manufacturers 
when it comes to fixing the system employers have the greatest 
incentive to make changes miccolis said adding that after all 
its their money 
most programs employers use to help contain costs are effective 
the survey said for example 84 percent of those surveyed have 
safety programs 64 percent screen potential employees and nearly 
half audit medical bills 
only when employers impose rigorous controls will benefit 
costs moderate and the system refocus on its basic purpose 
fostering a safe work environment and getting injured workers 
highquality care and back to productive employment miccolis 
said 
workers compensation first enacted in wisconsin in 1911 was 
designed as an employerpaid nofault insurance program to protect 
workers on the job in return for such protection employees gave 
up the right to sue their employers but litigation has increased 
substantially over the years as have the scope of compensation 
claims

cummins engine cos announcement thursday 
that it will suffer losses through the first quarter of 1991 
underscore the toll the recession and new emission orders are 
taking on the trucking industry an analyst said 
the columbus indbased engine maker said it expects a 
fourthquarter loss substantially greater than the 337 
million deficit it racked up in the third quarter it also expects 
a loss in the first quarter next year 
further cummins said it would take a pretax charge against the 
fourthquarter loss to pay for restructuring 
the announcement was expected given the current economic 
climate overall and new emission orders from the environmental 
protection agency taking effect jan 1 that are expected to add 
15002000 to the cost of each truck engine said frank 
prezelski an industry analyst with rothschild inc 
if its not a recession its close enough i think were 
going to see a bottom for the truck industry in the first 
quarter prezelski said 
the epa order caused early buying for new trucks because of the 
added costs its also delaying new orders because of questions 
over how well the new engines will perform with added controls 
potential customers want to see how new engines from various 
companies hold up for others before they commit to buy prezelski 
said 
firstquarter demand shifted to fourth quarter most of it 
is related to these emission orders prezelski said youve got 
a really nasty first quarter for the truck people theres very few 
who are going to make money 
cummins has reduced its payroll by more than 500 employees 
worldwide in recent months in dealing with the slumping truck 
market it also is eliminating certain operations and consolidating 
manufacturing plants the cost of the resulting charge against 
results has not been determined it said 
the company has about 25000 employees worldwide 
we are experiencing softening of several of our markets in the 
united states most notably the truck market which is our major 
market said company spokeswoman ann c smith we are also 
seeing a softening of the diesel generator market for 
recreational vehicles and marine 
the company said worsening business conditions in brazil also 
were hurting company results cummins brasil sa in sao paulo 
produces engines for industrial and marine use as well as diesel 
generators 
the thirdquarter loss amounted to 255 per share and came on 
sales of 8298 million in the period at that time cummins 
announced it had already trimmed more than 300 salaried and hourly 
employees worldwide and would reduce its production force in 
columbus by an additional 210 workers 
for the first nine months of the year cummins reported a loss 
of 187 million or 264 per share on sales of 26 billion 
prezelski is forecasting a fourthquarter loss of about 45 
million in addition to restructuring charges of 15 million to 30 
million 
cummins in july sold a combined 27 percent stake in the company 
to ford motor co tenneco inc and japanese enginemaker kubota 
ltd for a total of 250 million that investment now is providing 
a needed cash cushion prezelski said 
it would have been a lot tougher fo cummins engine had that 
not occurred he said

kansas city power amp light co said 
thursday it was dropping its hostile bid to take over kansas gas 
and electric co 
the company which earlier this month extended its 27ashare 
bid until jan 11 announced the offer for all outstanding common 
and preferred shares was being terminated 
it said it also would withdraw merger applications it had filed 
with the federal energy regulatory commission the kansas 
corporation commission and the missouri public service commission 
kgampe based in wichita had rebuffed the kcpl effort from its 
start in july and in october negotiated a friendly takeover 
agreement with topekabased kpl gas service co which offered 32 
per share 
at that time kcpl said it would continue to pursue the 
acquisition saying it might even be willing to raise its bid if it 
could get information from kgampe that would support a higher price 
wall street analysts had put kgampes value at between 31 and 33 a 
share 
but on thursday drue jennings president and chief executive 
officer of kcpl said his company had decided to drop out of the 
running 
we began our offer for kansas gas and electric intent on 
achieving a negotiated transaction that would provide unequaled and 
tangible benefits to all the communities and constituencies served 
by both companies including customers employees and 
shareholders jennings said we still believe in the unique 
benefits of such a combination today 
the company still felt its offer was full and fair but its 
board decided it was not in the interest of our customers 
employees and shareholders to compete with kpl gas service at 
the value levels they perceive 
in light of this we believe it is prudent at this time to 
withdraw our offer jennings said

an alliance of some of the worlds top computer 
software manufacturers has filed lawsuits against subsidiaries of 
frances rhonepoulenc sa and britains general electric co plc 
seeking to limit software copyright violations 
representatives of the business software alliance and the 
association francaise des editeurs de logiciels said they found 
pirated copies of computer programs at the headquarters of 
rhonepoulenc films sa 
members of the two associations inspected the rhonepoulenc film 
headquarters earlier this month and are demanding the equivalent 
of about 1 million in damages from the firm 
rhonepoulenc officials were not available to comment on the 
charges 
the business software alliance and the british federation 
against software theft also said wednesday they visited the offices 
of general electric unit marconi instruments ltd last month 
leading them to file a similar suit against the londonbased 
electronics maker general electric of britain is not related to 
the us company of the same name 
the marconi investigation came after us software makers 
ashtontate corp lotus development corp microsoft corp and 
wordperfect received a court order last month approving the search 
hugues leblanc president of the french software association 
said it was the first time software companies were allowed to 
inspect without warning the offices of a company suspected of 
copyright infringements 
the action by the software groups came a day before european 
ministers in charge of preparing for the 1992 unification of the 
european market adopted common legislation to protect software 
against piracy 
the ministers meeting thursday in brussels agreed that 
software manufacturers programs may be disassembled by users in 
order to create links so that they may be used with incompatible 
programs 
the practice was one of the main issues of contention among the 
ministers under the agreement such reverse engineering will 
be allowed without authorization from the copyright holder when it 
is indispensable for obtaining information necessary for 
interfacing a program that has been created independently of other 
programs 
robert holleyman general manager of the british software group 
said at a paris news conference wednesday that the industry groups 
have several other investigations in progress in france britain 
and elsewhere in europe 
the software groups are committed to coordinated action in 
europe to fight computer piracy holleyman said 
losses due to software piracy in the 12 european economic 
community countries totaled about 265 billion in 1989 according 
to the business software alliance

the stock market posted some spotty losses today 
as traders sorted through the latest data on the state of the 
consumer economy 
the commerce department reported that retail sales declined 01 
percent in november registering a smaller drop than analysts had 
been expecting 
that sent bond prices lower and interest rates higher in the 
credit markets prices of longterm treasury bonds fell almost 5 
for each 1000 in face value raising their yields to the 
neighborhood of 811 percent 
the response in the stock market was not so negative brokers 
said stock traders interpreted the figure as a sign of continuing 
but not necessarily worsening weakness in the economy

holiday sales stalled by the economy and the 
weather remained sluggish this week although some retailers 
reported signs of improvement heading into the crucial last 10 days 
before christmas 
business is picking up for some retailers who started off the 
season slowly a spot check around the country revealed 
the london harness co which sells briefcases and other 
specialty gifts in boston has seen its business increase each 
weekend of the holiday season said christine hyland the store 
manager 
were following last years patterns which is the best we can 
hope for at this point she said 
manufacturers who supply merchandise to stores are also seeing 
some signs of a pickup 
the last few days have been better than the last few weeks 
said al teller chairman of mca incs music entertainment group 
which manufactures records compact discs and cassettes 
this past weekend was strong enough that there seems to be 
some reasonable degree of optimism teller said wednesday 
but business is still off at some retailers 
joseph deluca president of ij fox furs in boston said his 
sales are down about 10 percent compared with last year 
we are not making the figures we would like to but its not 
going to be a disaster he said 
the weather continued to be an obstacle in many areas while 
temperatures remained unseasonably in some parts making it hard 
for shoppers to feel in a holiday mood it snowed heavily in other 
areas 
in the midwest younkers inc saw its sales drop after some of 
its 34 stores were closed because of heavy snow des moines got 10 
inches of snow and as much as 15 inches fell in other parts of 
iowa 
sales at many retailers have tumbled so far this season because 
consumers concerned about the faltering economy and the middle 
east crisis have been buying fewer and cheaper gifts that 
sluggishness helped drag down overall retail sales during the month 
of the november the government reported thursday 
the slow season has had a dampening effect on store employment 
in some areas 
orders from retailers for temporary help are clearly down this 
year jeff green a manager in the minnesota department of jobs and 
training said earlier this week 
and pete moor an office manager for job service an employment 
agency in west st paul minn said he has seen very little 
activity in the way of retail requests for temporary help this 
season 
our placements have been down over the past month moor 
said we havent noticed any pickup and its getting late in the 
season 
in the dallas area just looking at number of job openings we 
had our overall orders in the retail business is somewhat below 
what we had last year said ron rogers a placement supervisor 
with the texas employment commission 
some retailers said their staffing has been unaffected by 
economic problems this season 
nordstrom inc hired about the same number of parttime workers 
for its 62 clothing stores as it did last year spokesman tim doke 
said at dayton hudson corp spokeswoman ann barkelew said 
staffing at the companys department discount and apparel stores 
also was running in line with 1989 levels 
many retailers have staffed conservatively but also made 
provisions for increasing the number of sales help should business 
improve substantially 
at pier 1 imports a store might normally have 10 staffers and 
20 for the holidays but this year that same store likely will 
have 15 employees for christmas chairman clark a johnson said 
were calling in other people as required at the companys 
554 outlets johnson said 
pier 1 like many other retailers depends heavily on parttime 
help so if more staffing is needed employees are asked to work 
longer hours johnson said 
johnson reported business at his stores is running ahead of last 
years levels and ahead of projections he said his home furnishing 
chain has benefited from consumers who are trading down 
searching for less expensive gifts than last year

develop the economically backward region 
we need important symbols of investment german economics 
minister helmut haussmann said at a signing ceremony 
louis r hughes the american chairman of adam opel ag called 
on other international investors to take action to help the people 
of eastern europe who have ousted socialist regimes in favor of the 
freemarket system 
it will not do just to say that the market economy is the 
better system we must prove it through our business hughes said

annually it will create 2600 new jobs opel said with the first 
cars to come off the assembly line in late 1992 
the investment is a boon to the united germany which fears as 
many as onequarter of the 8 million workers in former east germany 
may become unemployed as inefficient companies from the staterun 
system collapse or contract the government hopes for massive 
investment in the region from german and foreign companies

interest in eastern germany even before east and west germany were 
unified in october opel had arranged to have its vectra models 
assembled in eisenach at the plant making the wartburg the second 
most popular east german car after the tiny trabant 
automobiles have been made in eisenach since 1899 when a 
twocylinder wartburg was produced but even with the opel 
investment the future of the local auto industry is unclear the 
trust agency hasnt decided what to do with the wartburg plant 
which has 7000 workers 
wartburg director wolfram liedtke urged the trust agency to make 
a quick decision if the treuhand doesnt decide in theory i 
cant build any more cars after jan 1 he said 
without continued wartburg production liedtke said more

billion the washingtonbased mutual fund trade group originally 
reported the total for the week ended dec 12 at 42489 billion 
there was virtually no change in the level of moneymarket 
fund assets held in individual accounts but the rapid buildup of 
assets held in institutional accounts continued unabated said 
dr jacob dreyer vice president and chief economist at the 
institute 
even though yields offered by institutional moneymarket funds 
again eased a bit the yield differential in their favor over 
direct moneymarket instruments widened considerably he said 
the institue said that in the latest week assets of 267 
general purpose funds rose 3096 million to 15065 billion 
assets of 104 brokerdealer funds dropped 3873 million to 16614 
billion and assets of 163 institutional funds rose 295 billion

per barrel on the futures market as traders renewed their focus on 
the possibility of war in the persian gulf 
light sweet crude oil rose 107 to 2642 per barrel at the new 
york mercantile exchange on contracts for delivery in january 
the markets getting a little bit nervous again said 
annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman 
brothers inc 
traders got the jitters amid news stories on persistent troubles 
the united states and iraq have faced in trying to set up 
diplomatic meetings to discuss the desert standoff 
in financial markets the news stories were inflated into rumors 
that the talks would not be held at all pushing crude prices 
higher from the open hittle said 
in the afternoon the rally gained momentum after iraqi 
president saddam hussein announced he wants peace in the gulf but 
would gladly wage war to prevent foreign domination of arab oil or 
land 
it was more of the bellicose rhetoric hittle said 
crudes rally came on the heels of nearly two weeks of losses 
rooted in perceptions that a peaceful solution could end the gulf 
crisis prices settled wednesday at their lowest levels since aug 
3 the day after iraqs invasion of kuwait 
oil also got a boost thursday from opecs announcement that it 
would keep pumping all the crude it can during the crisis but 
return to its previous quotas once the standoff ends 
as oil prices moved up most other energy futures traded higher 
the main exception was home heating oil for january delivery 
which fell 06 cent to 7457 cents a gallon heating oil was higher 
for nearly all later delivery months 
some traders were apparently selling the heating oil contracts 
and buying unleaded gasoline futures which were relatively cheap 
closing at 6557 cents a gallon up 108 cents for january 
delivery according to randall rothenberg a broker at dean witter 
reynolds inc gasoline for delivery in later months was higher 
natural gas which is not directly affected by the potential for 
war in the middle east finished mixed january delivery contracts 
were up 16 cents at 222 per 1000 cubic feet

bank of new england corp has been bolstering its 
frail finances with us treasury money but the bank said thursday 
it does not need the funds to stay afloat 
the bank crippled by mountains of bad real estate loans has 
been trying to rebuild slowly under the supervision of federal 
regulators 
during this time the bank has participated in a program where 
tax money is deposited in banks until the treasury needs the funds 
federal officials say banks routinely use this system to improve 
their liquidity and that bank of new england received no special 
treatment 
but financial experts question whether the government is 
essentially propping up troubled institutions 
bank of new englands fortunes fell quickly last year when the 
regions real estate market slumped exposing problem loans the 
bank lost more than 1 billion and depositors pulled out about 7 
billion 
that prompted the bank to borrow heavily from the federal 
reserve bank of boston to meeting pressing needs for cash 
in february bank of new england signed consent orders with the 
us comptroller of the currency which required the company to 
take steps to improve its operations a section in the orders 
called for the bank to improve its liquidity 
ellen stockdale a spokeswoman for the comptrollers office 
said her agency knew bank of new england was using treasury 
deposits to improve its liquidity 
if we thought they were doing something grossly irresponsible 
we would stop it she said this is not the first time a bank 
in trouble has done this 
under the socalled tax and loan deposits about 3000 banks 
across the country collect tax money that is held in accounts for 
the treasury the treasury routinely draws money from the accounts 
to maintain a 5 billion balance at the federal reserve 
when tax receipts run high during certain periods of the year 
excess money is deposited in about 170 banks around the country 
according to the treasury 
bank of new england with assets of 23 billion holds treasury 
money under both of those systems federal officials said but the 
excess deposits are not considered dependable since the treasury 
usually pulls them within a few days 
bank of new englands treasury deposits hit a peak in april at 
18 billion said james dorsey a bank spokesman but a statement 
from the bank called this figure irrelevant since april is tax 
time when treasury deposits are at their highest levels 
dorsey said bank of new englad had been holding treasury 
deposits before the companys financial troubles arose and he 
noted that the deposits as of wednesday totaled 77 million 
compared to 18 billion in total deposits 
if we didnt have 77 million would we be liquid of course 
we would he said 
the bank stopped borrowing from the federal reserve in june and 
instead has been lending money to other banks while retail deposits 
have climbed steadily dorsey said 
meanwhile federal officials stressed that the treasury deposits 
are backed by collateral and money is not at risk the treasury 
said it has never lost money on these deposits and specific banks 
are not targeted to receive funds 
but stuart greenbaum a professor of financial institutions at 
the kellogg graduate school of management at northwestern 
university said the government has some discretion with the way it 
deposits its money 
in that sense he said the government may be trying to help 
keep bank of new england open while the company addresses its 
troubles 
stockdale at the comptrollers office said the bank has missed 
some deadlines specified in the consent order but you can adjust 
around it a little bit 
they are working on their problems she said 
morris mendelson a finance professor at the university of 
pennsylvanias wharton school said when the government provides 
such help it is not motivated totally by mercy if a bank fails 
then the government could face the costly task of paying off 
deposits 
in a letter this month to the senate banking committee robert 
glauber the treasurys under secretary for finance said the 
agency has not used deposits to fund banks that experience 
financial troubles 
bank of new england shares moved up 12 cents to 112 in 
trading of new york stock exchange stocks thursday

which is within the feds target range of 3 percent to 7 percent 
the growth rate in m3 over the past year was up 17 percent which

percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 
13 weeks m3 averaged 40913 billion up 08 percent while m1

eastern airlines fought thursday to avoid 
disclosure of information used in the criminal investigation into 
its maintenance practices saying it wanted to protect employees 
who may not be implicated in the probe 
when there is any kind of ongoing investigation there is not 
a right to access eastern attorney jane w parver told a 
threejudge panel of the us court of appeals in manhattan 
assistant us attorney jonathan d polkes a prosecutor in the 
criminal case against eastern in brooklyn said the flying public 
had a right to know what was in an affidavit used to support a 
search warrant for easterns offices in miami 
there is no basis to keep the affidavit sealed polkes said 
legally eastern in on very thin ice 
last friday us district judge i leo glasser of brooklyn 
ruled the affidavit should be made public but he gave eastern time 
to take its case to the higher court the appeals panel did not say 
when it would rule 
prosecutors investigating alleged safety violations at eastern 
used the search warrant to seize safety logs and other records on 
dec 1 
federal officials said they were looking for evidence that 
eastern had continued to inadequately inspect its jetliners for 
safety problems even after it was indicted earlier this summer 
in july prosecutors in brooklyn filed criminal charges against 
eastern alleging a pattern of falsifying safety records and other 
maintenance documents to keep its planes flying 
two eastern maintenance workers at new yorks kennedy airport 
have pleaded guilty and are expected to testify against the airline 
at trial next year

board of trade in a negative reaction to the export credits granted 
the soviet union 
on other markets silver was lower while gold advanced 
livestock and pork futures retreated and energy prices gained 
grain and soybean traders were disappointed with the 500 
million to 1 billion in export credits given the soviets the 
market was expecting at least 15 billion in credits would be 
given to the soviets said william biedermann an analyst with 
allendale inc in chicago 
biedermann said the market had been led to believe the soviets 
would get 15 billion to 3 billion in credits 
in granting the credits president bush lifted a 15year ban 
imposed because of the soviet prohibition of free emigration 
wheat futures were able to come off their lows for the day on 
talk the soviets would make wheat purchases a priority there were 
also reports china may soon enter the market 
soyoil prices received a boost on news the us state department 
has approved the awarding of 275 million in export credits to 
pakistan the granting of credits had been held up while an 
investigation was made into pakistans nuclear weapons capability

delivery in december at 254 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 4 
cents lower with december at 223 a bushel oats were 1 cent to 2 
cents lower with december at 108 a bushel soybeans were 5 cents 
to 9 cents lower with january at 588 a bushel 
energy futures advanced on the new york mercantile exchange as 
the attention of the market returned away from the opec ministerial 
meeting in vienna to events in the persian gulf 
analysts said prices were boosted by iraqs insistence that it 
set a date for a meeting between president saddam hussein and 
secretary of state jame baker and bakers statement that iraq is 
not serious about having talks with the united states 
opec ministers attending a twoday meeting in vienna agreed to 
keep production quotas suspended until the end of the gulf crisis 
current production of 229 million barrels a day is outpacing 
demand analysts said

silver prices plunged to their lowest level in 14 years on new 
yorks commodity exchange but recovered somewhat while still 
finishing lower for the day 
silver continues to suffer from a lack of investor interest

slowing industrial demand also is affecting the price of silver 
about 40 percent of which is used by the film industry 
gold prices were higher trading in line with crude oil prices 
gold was 160 to 190 higher with february at 37510 a troy 
ounce silver was 1 cent to 25 cents lower with december at 4006 
a troy ounce 
livestock and pork futures fell on the chicago mercantile 
exchange as traders reacted negatively to the smallerthanexpected 
offering of export credits to the soviets 
a larger credit line was expected to lead to meat purchases by 
the soviets but they are now likely to confine purchases to 
grains 
cattle futures also were pressured by news of a medical study 
indicating daily consumption of red meat contributed to colon 
cancer 
analysts said the report is not likely to have a longterm 
effect on beef demand but it can be used to push futures down from 
record high levels 
live cattle were 27 cent lower to 07 cent higher with december 
at 8092 cents a pound feeder cattle were 40 cent lower to 18 
cent higher with january at 8887 cents a pound live hogs were 03

southland corp has some powerful allies when it 
goes before a us bankruptcy judge with a restructuring plan 
friday the people it owes money 
the dallasbased owner of 7eleven convenience stores is the 
largest of a handful of companies to reorganize under chapter 11 of 
the us bankruptcy code with a plan that has already been approved 
by most of its creditors 
southland filed a prepackaged chapter 11 bankruptcy plan in 
october the company which had sales of almost 8 billion last 
year said it was overwhelmed by debt left from its 49 billion 
leveraged buyout in 1987 
the filing listed 253 billion in assets and 338 billion in 
liabilities 
typically a company files for chapter 11 protection and then 
presents a judge with a reorganization plan that must be approved 
by creditors a timeconsuming process 
southland officials believe prepackaging will allow the company 
to get through the bankruptcy within six months 
a prepackaged bankruptcy offered us the potential of 
completing the chapter 11 process much more quickly and would 
therefore be much less disruptive to our business said cecilia 
stubbs norwood a southland spokeswoman 
attorneys for southland and creditors who have approved the plan 
will argue its merits before us bankruptcy judge harold abramson 
on friday some related issues regarding the sale of a dallas 
skyscraper southland built are to be argued before abramson next 
week 
the securities and exchange commission plans to ask the judge 
for another 45 days to review southlands case agency spokesman 
john heine said in washington the sec believes southlands case 
will set a precedent for prepackaged bankruptcy proceedings and 
merits a lengthier review heine said 
southland first proposed a restructuring last march when it 
announced the sale of most of the company to itoyokado co ltd 
and seveneleven japan co ltd its japanese affiliates the 
buyers would provide 430 million in new cash for stock in the 
reorganized company 
prepackaging is receiving greater use since merv griffins 
resorts international inc used a form of it last year donald 
trump is using a prepackaged plan in the restructuring announced 
this month of his taj mahal casino in atlantic city nj 
letteringmachine maker kroy inc of scottsdale ariz has also 
filed a prepackaged bankruptcy proposal 
to make a prepackaged filing a company must get the 
reorganization approved by at least 50 percent of the bondholders 
holding at least twothirds of the debt if a judge approves the 
terms of the plan are then imposed on the dissenting minority 
that makes prepackaging a powerful weapon for creditors against 
the holdouts who will never approve a companys reorganization 
plan hoping instead for separate often better terms 
the prepackaged plan is a nice balanced way of giving 
creditors say so in the future and permitting the company to 
reorganize in a rapid efficient way said dallas attorney mark 
macdonald who helped republic health corp reorganize in such a 
way 
republic a dallasbased owner of 14 hospitals filed a 
prepackaged chapter 11 plan last december to restructure debt it 
took on in a 1986 leveraged buyout republic emerged from 
bankruptcy in april and earned a profit during its last quarter of 
1990 which ended aug 31 
companies with operational problems or strife between many 
creditors could not use prepackaging to reorganize said new york 
bankruptcy attorney steven r gross who also represented republic 
health 
there are also dangers in prepackaging such as a mistake being 
made outside the courts view and then not detected until a judges 
only alternative is to order a new filing 
but a prepackaged bankruptcy may give a restructuring company a 
boost before a judge gross said 
when a bankruptcy judge is looking at a prepackaged plan 
or taking the risk of two or three years of bankruptcy for a 
company the judge is going to err on the side of getting that 
company out gross said 
if everyone is sitting there saying lets go thats very 
hard to resist he said

states is the first midsized station wagon in the honda line it 
began rolling off assembly lines nov 20 at the companys 
marysville plant officials said at a briefing to introduce the

sales 
elliott said he expects about 35000 wagons to be sold in the 
first year he said between 4000 and 5000 will be marketed in 
europe and the rest in japan and other far east markets 
honda said the wagon is the first usmade car the company will 
export to europe it joins the accord line of fourdoor sedans and 
twodoor coupes also made at marysville about 35 miles northwest 
of columbus honda exports the accord coupe to asia 
the accord was the topselling car in the united states last 
year and is expected to be again this year when final numbers are 
tallied by adding a station wagon the model could widen its 
already substantial lead over the no 2 seller ford motor cos 
taurus which includes a station wagon version 
kurt antonius manager of public relations for honda of america 
said the nations station wagon sales declined sharply with the 
introduction of the minivan in the mid1980s but is enjoying a 
resurgence he said the honda wagon is expected to be a sport and 
family vehicle 
the wagon was designed at hondas torrance calif facility and 
engineered and tested at its central ohio plant 
antonius said hondas total sales through november were up 15 
percent over 1989 and the accord sedans and coupes will have 58 
percent of the honda market in 1990 total accord sales for 1990 
are expected to be about 410000 units up from 380000 in 1989 
elliott said the addition of the station wagon at marysville 
will not increase total production at the plant assembly of the 
civic is being shifted to hondas new plant in east liberty less 
than 10 miles away and assembly of the station wagon will be mixed 
with that of accords fourdoor and twodoor coupe models

the 140horsepower ex both with a standard fivespeed 
transmission or the optional fourspeed automatic both have 
22liter fourcylinder engines

it also was expected to get 20 or 22 miles per gallon in city 
driving and 26 or 27 miles a gallon on the highway also depending 
on the model 
base prices for the honda wagon are higher than those of the 
taurus which range from 15629 to 19128 the honda is slightly 
longer and narrower than the taurus but has a longer wheelbase 
the announcement of the new car came as the nations 
fourthlargest automaker reported us sales for the year running 
15 percent ahead of last year it said 676981 honda automobiles 
were sold through november compared with 589090 at the same time 
in 1989

the dollar firmed slightly against major foreign 
currencies thursday in sleepy preholiday trading that largely took 
its cue from technical factors 
gold rose while silver prices fell to their lowest level in 14 
years before recovering 
the thinly traded currency market seemed unmotivated by external 
influences that brisker sessions typically take into consideration 
traders said there was no market reaction to a government report 
of retail sales falling 01 percent in november the first decline 
in six months 
while news of economic troubles generally drive down the 
dollars value against foreign currencies traders said the 
continuing prospect for war in the persian gulf kept them 
cautiously bullish 
war news has particularly strengthened the dollar against the 
japanese yen because japans economy is so dependent on imported 
oil 
you have two situations going against each other someone 
could make a warlike statement and that will pop the dollar up 
said thomas j palladino a trader at osterreichische landerbank 
people are a little afraid of taking a position one way or 
another he said 
likewise traders said the market was not affected by the 
deutsche bundesbanks regular meeting thursday which left german 
interest rates unchanged 
traders said the lack of a definitive stance by the german 
central bank on the dollars decline left currency markets without 
direction 
they didnt say anything new it was everything the market 
expected said earl i johnson vice president at harris trust amp 
savings in chicago 
the market also brushed aside rumors later proved untrue that 
the planned meeting between secretary of state james a baker iii 
and iraq president saddam hussein had been canceled 
the dollar gained against the yen in new york closing at 13217 
yen from 13145 late wednesday in tokyo the dollar fell to a 
closing 13130 japanese yen from 13188 yen at wednesdays close

francs up from 12610 50255 french francs up from 50120

by transferring stock holdings from trans world 
airlines inc to its corporate parent for 77 million in cash twa 
owner carl icahn is providin his troubled carrier with a cash 
infusion as the slow winter travel season nears analysts said 
thursday 
twa said it had sold an interest in 5 million shares of usx 
corp to its parent twa airlines which in turn gave the carrier 
the money 
the proceeds of the sale would be added to twas general 
working capital and would be used for general corporate purposes 
the airline said in a statement that referred questions to 
spokesman gary duberstein 
duberstein declined to discuss the matter with a reporter on 
thursday 
the stock transfer comes at a time when other airlines have 
sought cash infusions through the sales of various assets and in 
the case of eastern airlines persuading a bankruptcy court to 
release millions of dollars from an escrow account 
the corporate statement said trans world picked up a 30 million 
profit from the transfer with the shares priced at wednesdays 
close of 3075 and it still retains an interest in about 68 
million shares of usx 
analysts said the airline was apparently putting its hands on 
needed cash after being hit hard by the rise in fuel costs brought 
on by the persian gulf crisis even before iraq invaded kuwait twa 
has been hurt through recent years as competitors with stronger 
domestic hubs have built up their service to foreign destinations 
chipping away at twas strong suit 
that trend has also hurt pan am corp which along with trans 
world used to dominate overseas travel years ago many passengers 
flew however they could to new york where they connected to trans 
world or pan am flights into europe but now many people fly the 
competition directly from other cities to foreign points 
the other carriers have moved those passengers from trans 
world and pan am to their own airlines flying out of interior 
points said george james president of airline economics inc a 
washingtonbased aviation consulting firm 
they have some serious cash flow problems as most of the 
carriers who are in financial trouble have james said 
airline analyst raymond e neidl of dillon read amp co inc 
agreed trans world has probably started running low on cash just 
before winter traditionally the worst time of the year for 
airlines 
theyre taking money out of one pocket and putting into 
another neidl said i think its a wise move 
james estimated that higher fuel prices during the last five 
months of the year will probably cost trans world from 200 million 
to 250 million the increased costs come as demand for air travel 
has tapered off

american investors are now welcome to invest 
even in soviet defense industries president mikhail s gorbachev 
said in an interview with a us business magazine 
the united states is lagging behind germany but ranks ahead of 
japan in responding to investment possibilities in the soviet 
union gorbachev told fortune magazine in a kremlin interview this 
month 
longterm loans on favorable terms with payments after seven 
years or more are particularly important now gorbachev said 
but so is cooperation in modernizing factories in light industry 
in food processing in electric power engineering and in the 
defense industry 
with regard to defense industries gorbachev said of course 
the big problem is conversion to civilian production its both 
your problem and our problem you have to find a way out how to 
use the potential of your defense industry which is shrinking as a 
result of the reduction in military contracts for us the problem 
is even more acute and it is good that we have begun 
cooperating here and we are exchanging our experiences about how 
to convert 
there are a lot of interesting projects gorbachev added 
among longterm projects he said there is an idea for 
cooperation among ourselves the americans and the israelis to 
develop a commercial passenger aircraft these are all 
largescale projects and there are many more 
he said germans have been the most aggressive in their response 
because the germans know us better especially now because of the 
17 million former east germans 
but there are many projects where there is a lot of room for 
cooperation with american business gorbachev said 
so far nothing has worked out with the japanese the soviet 
president said they are waiting for permission from their 
foreign ministry 
the fortune interview is in the dec 31 issue of the fortnightly 
magazine which is due on newsstands dec 17 
gorbachev said he wants to speed up the convertibility of the 
ruble into dollars and other hard currencies we thought this 
process would take a long time he said now we are cutting it 
shorter otherwise it will be difficult for us to carry out our 
economic cooperation 
the biggest difficulty today gorbachev said is the 
instability of the consumer market the first thing to be done is 
to tie up the mass of hot money or crazy money more is 
being produced than before but on the other hand there is nothing 
on the shelves and the situation becomes panicky 
gorbachev complained about us congressional limitations on 
trade such as those in the jacksonvanik amendment to the 1974 us 
trade act which deprived the soviet union of mostfavorednation 
status because of soviet immigration and travel restrictions we 
have the status of a mostunfavored nation he said 
on wednesday several days after the fortune interview 
president bush waived some aspects of the jacksonvanik amendment 
in order to provide the soviet union up to 1 billion in food aid

kuwait invasion on aug 2 which sent the price of crude oil and 
gasoline skyrocketing 
crude prices have fallen lately but the recent drops generally 
have not shown up at gas pumps in part because of a 5

the french senate on thursday voted into law 
measures that will raise the price of cigarettes and place strict 
curbs advertisements for tobacco and alcoholic beverages 
the law approved by an 18196 vote forbids all forms of direct 
or indirect tobacco advertising beginning jan 1 1993 orders 
hikes in the price of cigarettes and removes cigarettes from the 
list of products used to calculate the consumers price index 
it is less severe on alcohol taking into account the concerns 
of legislators from winegrowing regions who forced the rejection 
in october of stiffer measures in another version of the bill 
the new law permits alcohol advertising in wineproducing 
regions in the written press aimed at adults and in certain radio 
broadcasts 
the law forbids sponsorship of alcoholic beverages or tobacco by 
companies in sports or other events 
jeanmarie balestre president of the international federation 
of auto sports objected to the measures saying there are other 
much more dangerous scourges like drugs 
auto racing is among the sports that depends heavily on such 
sponsorship 
but health minister claude evin has said the law is necessary to 
lower consumption of cigarettes and alcohol by french youths and 
has praised the success of antismoking campaigns in the united

president bush approved the sale of 
supercomputers and other high technology exports to brazil india 
and china thursday night but ordered new safeguards to ensure the 
computers are not used for military purposes 
the white house said bush had ordered new controls on how export 
licenses are granted for the sensitive advanced technology 
equipment 
the white house refused to provide details of which specific 
licenses had been granted how much the contracts are for and what 
computers are going to each country 
but an administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said bush had ruled on a series of eight applications 
and most of them were approved he would not specify how many 
were turned down 
bush announced last week in brazil that he was approving an 
export license for a supercomputer for the embraer aircraft corp 
in brazil he cited that countrys recent pact with argentina 
forswearing nuclear weapons as the reason for his approval 
the commerce department will notify the companies starting 
friday which contracts have been approved and which rejected the 
administration refused to divulge other details saying the 
information was considered proprietary to the companies involved 
decisions on these export license had been held up due to 
interagency differences and debate over whether to allow the 
advanced technology exports 
in a written statement white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said the president approved several of the license 
applications but because of the potential strategic applications 
of such computers he also required the imposition of stringent 
safeguards to ensure that the computers will be used exclusively 
for peaceful civilian purposes 
fitzwater said bush had put in place a package of procedural 
reforms to streamline and clarify export license processing while 
enhancing our export controls to stem the spread of missile 
technology and nuclear chemical and biological weapons 
he said the license applications from brazil india and china 
all had raised a number of national security concerns 
bushs initiative includes 
worldwide export controls on 50 chemicals that can be used to 
manufacture chemical weapons 
export licenses for proposed exports that may be used in 
developing missiles or chemical and biological weapons 
civil and criminal penalties against us citizens who 
participate in activities that promote the spread of missile 
technology and chemical weapons such penalties already apply to

are entitled to prompt review of export license applications and 
that there is a presumption of approval of such applications 
based on our commitment to an open international trading system and 
the need to ensure american competitiveness 
the commerce department is in the business of spurring american 
exports and at times has found itself at loggerheads with the

bush now has ordered the foreign policy control cases to be 
subject to the same reviews as the national security control cases

walt disney co and jim henson productions 
broke off talks thursday after failing to reach an agreement on 
disneys plans to acquire rights to kermit the frog miss piggy and 
the other muppet characters 
the proposed deal to acquire henson associates inc was valued 
at 100 million to 150 million disney also had sought an 
exclusive production agreement with jim henson productions in the 
talks which began in august 1989 
we truly regret we could not come to terms disney chairman 
and chief executive michael d eisner said in a statement 
erwin okun a senior disney vice president said it was too 
early to tell whether the failed acquisition would preclude disney 
and henson productions from launching future joint productions 
however he noted that statements issued by both companies were 
cordial 
we have great admiration for jim and respect for the henson 
people the family who weve gotten to know pretty well okun 
said 
the henson family which has owned henson productions since the 
puppeteers death in may said current projects with disney would 
not be affected 
those projects include a disney channel television series jim 
hensons mother goose a situation comedy series involving 
dinosaurs which is scheduled to air in january on abc and a 3d 
film that will be shown to visitors to walt disney world in 
florida 
we would have liked to see this deal succeed the henson 
family said in a news release unfortunately after 18 months of 
negotiating the companies could ot reach a mutually satisfactory 
agreement 
henson who died may 18 founded his production company in 1958 
as muppets inc to produce all his properties 
recent negotiations had centered around the lower price disney 
offered after henson death 
analysts had speculated that his passing would lessen the value 
of the acquisition hensons personal talents formed part of 
eisners original strategy to crossmarket muppet characters such 
as kermit the frog and miss piggy with disney creations 
jeffrey logsdon an analyst with crowell weedon amp co said it 
was more likely that disney was scared off by hefty estate taxes 
owed on henson properties 
there were enormous estate tax problems from what i have 
heard that was a major area that was problematic logsdon said 
it gets down to them asking what are we really getting as a 
return what kind of money will we be making 
in losing the deal disney lost the opportunity to combine two 
sets of highly loved and highly marketable characters logsdon 
said 
it gave disney a whole new range of characters to utilize in 
their theme parks and entertainment projects logsdon said 
disney reached an agreement in principle with henson only weeks 
after negotiations began last year the deal called for henson to 
operate a los angeles production company under the disney umbrella 
except for kermit the frog disney was not to receive rights to 
muppet characters that appear regularly on sesame street those 
characters are owned in part by the shows producer childrens 
television workshop

the latest freebie program to hit the sagging 
airline industry began spreading thursday as american united and 
northwest scrambled to match a promotion launched two days earlier 
by delta 
now four relatively strong players in the otherwise stumbling 
industry are offering passengers who complete eight segments of 
air travel a free flight to be taken next year 
when atlantabased delta air lines began the latest battle by 
launching an earlierthanusual winter special analysts said it 
appeared to be escalating the general fare war and applying direct 
pressure to a struggling rival eastern airlines 
deltas offer this week of free tickets or firstclass upgrades 
to passengers who fly as few as two roundtrip excursions comes 
earlier than the traditional sales offered by airlines during their 
slow winter season 
after delta announced its promotion on tuesday it was followed 
thursday by a similar freebie plan unveiled by american airlines 
which claimed its deal made it easier for some passengers to obtain 
a free trip 
hours later united airlines chimed in with its own freebie 
plan 
and northwest airlines entered the fray with a plan that offers 
free tickets for flying three roundtrips the minnesotabased 
carrier boasts that it is the only airline to include free travel 
to europe and hawaii 
analysts had been somewhat surprised to see the latest fare 
battle begin with delta which usually follows other carriers in 
pricing decisions it apparently decided to become a leader by 
starting the special before the crowds of holiday travelers have 
even come and gone 
it looks like its happened a little bit earlier now which is 
telling me bookings are a little bit softer than expected said 
raymond e neidl an airline analyst with the investment firm 
dillon read amp co inc 
airlines are limping toward their biggest annual losses ever 
largely because of high fuel costs and a slumping economy that has 
weakened demand for air travel industry experts have said the 
outlook for 1991 is gloomy as well with available seats 
outstripping demand 
delta acknowledged slowerthandesirable bookings was part of 
its motivation for offering the freebies to frequent fliers who 
complete eight segments between dec 15 and march 15 a segment 
is defined as each flight with a different number so trips with 
connections can include several segments 
two round trips that include connections each way would qualify 
for the freebies which can be cashed in later next year 
the american plan also offers free trips for people who fly 
eight segments or three round trips whichevercomes first 
americans plan does not include firstclass upgrades because its 
frequent flyers already have plenty of opportunities for them 
spokesman tim smith said 
uniteds plan offers a free trip for customers who fly eight 
segments or three round trips and was announced in response to the 
moves by its rivals spokeswoman sara dornacker said 
the delta bonus was announced five days after rival eastern 
airlines made a similar move the eastern program offers a weekend 
ticket for 91 to anyone who makes a single round trip at a 
corporate rate fare during december or january 
delta spokesman neil monroe said he mentioned the eastern 
program only reluctantly because delta views its program as a 
systemwide deal designed to beat the competition in many markets 
some analysts however saw the delta move as a direct threat to 
eastern which is struggling to stay alive with a recent 135 
million cash infusion granted by a bankruptcy judge 
its a competitive necessity that delta keep eastern on the 
mat so to speak said kevin murphy an airline analyst with 
morgan stanley amp co i think this time the bankruptcy court has 
gone as low in the till as theyre going to go 
delta said the promotion may not cost it much money because 
most frequent fliers are expected to take firstclass upgrades 
instead of free trips delta will limit the number of seats 
available on each flight for passengers who choose the free travel 
monroe said 
still analysts said the competition would be pressured to come 
up with something similar before too long and it didnt take 
american too long to respond 
some analysts warned that deltas promotion could be countered 
by promotions that offer fliers an even better deal which would 
enhance the risk that airlines will do further damage to their 
alreadyweak earnings 
i would think all of the large carriers will find it desirable 
to remain competitive with delta so theyll come up with the same 
or something similiar said robert j joedicke an advisory 
director who follows airlines for shearson lehman brothers inc 
the big worry is that someone will come out with something 
broader neidl said
