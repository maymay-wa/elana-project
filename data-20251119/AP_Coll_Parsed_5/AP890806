five central american presidents failed to 
agree on a timetable for dismantling usbacked nicaraguan rebels 
as the chief executives ended on sunday night the second day of 
their threeday summit 
there is no accord about a timetable but there is agreement 
on mechanisms honduran president jose azcona told a news 
conference after the second round of talks 
the five presidents agreed at a meeting last february in el 
salvador to dismantle the nicaraguan rebels known as contras but 
postponed until this summit the ways to accomplish the task 
the bush administration wants to have the contras most of whom 
are based in honduras remain intact until elections in nicaragua 
next february 
azcona said the us government supplied documents to the 
conference but has not tried to influence events 
there was no pressure he said 
the us government is not participating in the talks but sent 
observers to the summit of the presidents of honduras nicaragua 
guatemala el salvador and costa rica 
costa rican president oscar arias had been optimistic earlier 
sunday on an agreement dealing with the contras estimated to have 
about 11000 fighters 
today well reach an agreement by consensus or from 
exhaustion he told the associated press 
the timetable for dismantling the contras is the major issue at 
the conference 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega told reporters he is flexible 
about the timetable and said he expected the resettlement to be 
gradual 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani said he hoped the peace 
talks also will deal with the nineyearold guerrilla war in el 
salvador 
ortega bolstered his position by signing an agreement friday 
with his domestic political opposition that calls for demobilizing 
the rebels in exchange he pledged democratic reforms 
we have made advances we have achieved substantial points we 
have exchanged opinions ortega told reporters after running on 
the beach in this tiny caribbean port town 
none of the presidents interviewed before sundays session would 
give details of the talks in tula about 200 miles north of 
tegucigalpa the capital 
but they would speak of their aspirations 
ive seen a willingness to go forward with the peace 
process said guatemalan president vinicio cerezo there are 
difficulties and we could stumble but i hope we can move forward 
arias who won the nobel peace prize for drafting a 1987 central 
american peace accord and promoting regional dialogue said 
the positions of the presidents seem to me very frank and 
sincere 
the world is expecting much from us principally the 28 
million central americans who dont want war not to advance would 
be to betray those hopes 
on saturday ortega presented a letter from the salvadoran 
rebels asking the summit to promote negotiations with the 
government on the salvadoran conflict 
we look at it positively cristiani said of the message 
they must contact us directly and we can look at how to begin a 
dialogue 
cristiani said his only condition for negotiations was that 
once the talks begin the rebels not look for excuses to break 
them 
before the summit ends monday leaders also hope to agree on a 
plan that would allow un observer forces to monitor the 
hondurasnicaragua and hondurasel salvador borders 
the contras have been fighting the sandinistas since 1981 they 
allege the nicarguan government betrayed the revolution that ousted 
late president anastasio somoza in 1979 ending 42 years of rule by 
his family 
fighting has declined to sporadic clashes since last year when 
the two sides signed a temporary truce and the united states halted 
military aid to the rebels the united states still provides the 
contras with humanitarian aid 
talks aimed at a permanent end to the 7yearold war which has 
left 50000 dead stand at an impasse

soviet officials will begin learning 
management americanstyle early next year from a company whose 
capitalist clients include exxon 
the russians are very interested because such concepts as 
openness teamwork mutual objectivesetting those things are 
unknown there said paul mcdonald president of scientific 
methods inc 
mcdonalds company has received a 250000 contract to conduct 
seminars for officials at the kiev management school in the ukraine 
beginning in february 
management practices in the land of the planned economy are 
anything but progressive mcdonald said 
i think the state of management in manufacturing there is 
probably the equivalent of what it was here in the 1930s he 
said the economy was bad then and people were willing to work 
under some pretty grim conditions 
under president mikhail gorbachevs effort to revitalize the 
soviet economy things are changing and soviet leaders are 
receptive to ideas from the west that would have been unheardof 
only a few years ago mcdonald said 
scientific methods a 28yearold company founded by university 
of texas professors robert blake and jane mouton was among the 
nations first to adapt behavioral science theories to the 
workplace 
the company uses a grid system to measure employee satisfaction 
and management effectiveness balancing production and morale 
elements include initiative employee inquiries conflict solving 
decisionmaking and critique 
i think its going to be radically different for some soviet 
managers mcdonald predicted but if you begin to introduce these 
new ideas people are going to readily embrace them 
in addition to exxon scientific methods us clients include 
the internal revenue service 
one of the firms clients which has a joint production venture 
with the soviet ministry of health thought the training might be 
good for its soviet partners 
the client brought the general manager of the ventures soviet 
plant to the united states for training and the soviet then 
contacted the kiev management school 
a contract was signed in june after mcdonald and blake the 
companys chairman visited kiev 
the contract calls for six seminars initially training up to 40 
people at a time the minster of health has indicated he will 
attend the first mcdonald said 
eventually we hope to train russian instructors as we do 
with companies in the united states

two bumbling bank robbers nearly foiled 
their own getaway when they drove a stolen car over nails they had 
strewn on the pavement to slow their pursuers 
the car with a flattened tire was found less than two blocks 
away from the mercantile bank branch the men robbed friday 
witnesses said they saw the men hustle out of the car and run 
across a weedcovered field with the banks money after abandoning 
the vehicle at a car wash 
the men wore ski masks and dark blue jumpsuits when they entered 
the bank took an undetermined amount of money from teller drawers 
and a cash machine and told the banks employees to lie on the 
floor 
as they left they padlocked a thick chain they had wrapped 
around the handles of the banks front doors apparently to slow 
any possible pursuers but left untouched an open rear door said 
detective les ramsey 
as the robbers pulled out of the parking lot they tossed out 
several boards studded with nails their points protruding upward 
to flatten the tires of any pursuing vehicles 
they then drove over one of the boards ramsey said

applying fertilizer to help nature 
decompose oil from the exxon spill is the most encouraging 
development so far in the response to the disaster us 
environmental protection agency administrator william reilly said 
saturday 
its good news and there hasnt been a lot where these oil 
spills are concerned reilly said at a news conference 
he said that by the time this seasons beach cleanup ends in 
midseptember about 70 miles of shoreline will have been treated 
with the available 500 metric tons of fertilizer oil has 
contaminated nearly 800 miles of shoreline according to the coast 
guard 
more of the frenchmade fertilizer will be manufactured by 
spring and there appears to be no limit on its use in future 
cleanup of crude oil from the exxon valdez reilly said the tanker 
struck a reef in prince william sound on march 24 spilling nearly 
11 million gallons of oil 
reilly who on friday inspected areas where epa has tested the 
fertilizer said it was not clear how well the fertilizer will work 
on aged oil 
he said the epa is committed to working on the cleanup until 
restoration of affected areas is complete and that he believes the 
same is true of exxon corp 
the oil company said last month that it expected to wrap up its 
work in midseptember because of changing weather and would 
reevaluate spillaffected areas next year to decide whether there 
should be more work 
faced with charges by the state and others that the company was 
reneging on an earlier promise to do whatever was necessary to 
restore contaminated areas company officials later said exxon 
would pursue beach cleanup in 1990 if directed by the coast guard 
exxon co usa president wd stevens told a congressional 
subcommittee last week that the company would go along with any 
reasonable request 
state officials have been pressing for work over the winter as 
weather permits and for an unequivocal statement from exxon that 
it will be back in 1990 for more work that will satisfy state 
standards 
exxon has an obligation and has made a commitment to stay the 
course reilly said but he added he is prepared to put pressure 
on the company if work ends before restoration is complete 
restoration amounts to returning the sound as substantially as 
possible to the condition that prevailed before the spill reilly 
said obviously in some areas thats going to be difficult to 
achieve 
about 5 million has been spent on the fertilizer program with 
much of the money going for research exxon covered most of the 
cost and epa expects the company to reimburse the agency for its 
16 million outlay reilly said 
the treatment increases the number of microbes already eating 
away at the oil reilly said the fertilizer can cut the time it 
takes for oil to decompose from five to 10 years to three to five 
years 
what we have tried to do is speed nature up reilly said 
the fertilizer method has not been used previously on alaska 
crude oil nor has it been used on a large scale 
coast guard vice adm clyde robbins the federal onscene 
coordinator of the spill cleanup authorized exxon a week ago to 
use fertilizer on heavily fouled shorelines

nicaraguan president daniel ortega said 
saturday that the only thing left to discuss regarding the 
ussupported contra uerrillas is how to disband them 
he and four other central american presidents began a threeday 
meeting in this caribbean resort to complete work on a regional 
peace accord that seeks to dismantle the nicaraguan rebel force 
the five presidents appeared together on a stage to formally 
begin the talks they made no statements during the ceremony 
the presidents then spent seven hours in what ortega called 
calm and constructive discussions 
ortega the only leader who spoke to reporters after the 
session also said he delivered a letter from leftist rebels in el 
salvador saying they were ready to negotiate with the government 
he did not disclose details 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani wants to link 
demobilizing the contras with negotiating an end to the 9yearold 
civil war in his own country nicaragua opposes that idea 
on friday ortega signed an agreement with the nicaraguan 
opposition that calls for disbanding the contra rebel force in 
exchange for electoral and political reforms 
president bush will have to accept reality and the reality is 
that the people of central america are tired of war we want peace 
because central americans are dying not americans and they should 
respect our decisions ortega said as he arrived for the summit 
he said the united states should take charge of disbanding the 
rebels and that the final issue to be settled was how to get the 
contras out peacefully and in an orderly manner 
although the united states halted arms supplies to the contras 
in 1988 it is still providing nonlethal aid to guerrillas and 
family members camped in the honduran mountains near the nicaraguan 
border 
the central american presidents agreed at a february summit in 
el salvador to resettle the contras but deferred considering 
details until this meeting 
it is cristianis first such meeting cristiani of el 
salvadors rightwing arena party replaced jose napoleon duarte as 
president on june 1 
cristiani has said his government is ready to talk with the 
salvadoran rebels once they lay down their arms rebel leaders who 
met with salvadoran oppostion parties in mexico city last week say 
this is tantamount to surrender 
we have been willing to negotiate with them since june 1 
cristiani said when he arrived in tela 
el salvador accuses nicaragua of arming the salvadoran rebels 
in washington nicaraguan rebel leaders who met with president 
bush said demobilization of their force must be tied to democratic 
reforms by the sandinista government 
the us government in recent days has tried to urge central 
american governments not to abandon the contras until general 
elections scheduled in that country in february 
asked about the us position guatemalan president vinicio 
cerezo said on arrival what is important is what the central 
american presidents decide he said his government was neutral on 
the issue 
we are the ones responsible for finding answers to conflicts 
that divide our peoples said president oscar arias of costa 
rica arias won the nobel peace prize for his efforts to reach a 
regional accord in 1987 
the us government is not attending the talks but barry sklar 
a staff member of the senate foreign relations committee said he 
hopes to discuss a possible regional economic aid package with the 
leaders 
the leaders also hope to agree on a plan that would allow un 
forces to patrol the hondurasnicaragua and hondurasel salvador 
borders the united nations has expressed its willingness to send 
peacekeeping forces to the region 
honduran president jose azcona hoyo said earlier that he would 
present a plan to demobilize and resettle the 11000 contras and 
12000 dependents in his country along the nicaraguan border the 
contras have worn out their welcome in honduras where most 
citizens would like to see the insurgents go home 
since last year a ceasefire has been in effect between 
nicaragua and the usbacked rebels but the two sides have yet to 
settle on a lasting peace 
the contras have been fighting the leftist sandinistas since 
1981 alleging the government betrayed the goals of the 1979 
revolution that ousted dictator anastasio somoza in 1979 
el salvadors civil war has left 70000 dead while 50000 
people have been killed in nicaraguas conflict

israels kidnapping of a lebanese shiite 
moslem cleric has strengthened the belief of lebanese moslem groups 
that they must strike against israel and its supporters an iranian 
daily said sunday 
jomhori islami quoted by irans islamic republic news agency 
referred to the abduction of sheik abdulkarin obeid by israeli 
commandos july 28 
if any group questioned the infliction of blows on israel and 
the united states before the zionist abduction of jibchits friday 
prayer leader obeid they are now resolute in their decision that 
there is no alternative but to inflict heavy blows on zionist 
occupiers and their supporters the newspaper said 
it welcomed un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellars 
call for the release of all hostages held in lebanon according to 
irna monitored in nicosia 
but the newspaper criticized perez de cuellar for making the 
suggestion only after the killing of american hostage lt col 
william r higgins the marines proiranian shiite moslem 
abuductors said they hanged him monday in retaliation for obeids 
abduction 
why did he not ask for the release of all hostages earlier 
when the execution of another american became serious he 
immediately thought about a solution jomhuri islami said of 
perez de cuellar 
this reference was to us hostage joseph james cicippio 58 
who is being held by the revolutionary justice organization 
another group of proiranian lebanese shiites the group gave him a 
reprieve on thursday and made a proposal for teh release of 
lebanese and palestinian prisoners in israel 
irna quoted the daily abrar as echoing the words of iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani in saying that the lebanese issue 
and the hostage crisis have rational solutions provided the united 
states and the west see the realities in the world 
abrar said the united states and israel conspired in the 
kidnapping of obeid 
irna quoted the newspaper kayhan international as saying that 
higgins and those facing a similar fate were victims of the 
mistaken policies of the united states and britain 
if the united states and britain did not support the terrorist 
israeli government the course of events would not be the way 
they are today today they are reaping what they planted

coal miners who walked off their jobs to protest a 
lack of information about government concessions returned to work 
sunday the tass news agency reported 
the official news agency said all mines and associated coal 
facilities of the arctic vorkuta region resumed work at midnight 
miners in 11 of the pechora coal basins 13 mines about 1100 
miles northeast of moscow walked off their jobs saturday in a 
renewal of the labor unrest that wracked the soviet union last 
month 
the miners had said they would stay off the job until they 
received the full text of a government decree that officials say 
fulfills promises made to get the miners to return to work last 
month 
after the earlier round of strikes the government agreed to 
bonuses for night work and miners using some dangerous equipment 
improvements in pensions and overtime and made general pledges to 
improve housing and end shortages of food and consumer goods 
tass said the miners struck again because they didnt have a 
copy of the government decree 
an instructor in the organizational department of the local 
communist party headquarters said in a telephone interview that a 
director of the staterun enterprise that operates all 13 mines 
brought a copy of the decree from moscow and explained it to the 
workers 
the miners then decided to return to work tass said 
the vorkuta miners struck july 19 several days after thousands 
of miners in other parts of the soviet union already had walked out 
they demanded improvements in living and working conditions and 
also that the government pay more attention to the problems of 
workers in the countrys far north 
the returned to work five days later but said they would walk 
out again if the government did not live up to its promises

with the clang of a single bell and the 
rush of 1000 doves overhead hiroshima came to a standstill sunday 
for a moment of silence to recall the worlds first nuclear attack 
44 years ago 
about 50000 people gathered in the citys peace memorial park 
to mark the anniversary of the citys destruction by a us atomic 
bomb prime minister sousuke uno said the memorial should sound 
an alarm for the future and he said japan should carry out more 
aggressive diplomacy to work for peace 
at 815 am the precise time when the bomb exploded in a flash 
of white light on aug 6 1945 hiroshima residents japanese 
government officials and foreign guests bowed their heads in silent 
prayer while this city of 1 million came to a halt a single bell 
rang and 1000 doves were released 
people on stopped buses and streetcars and patients in their 
hospital beds prayed 
at the same time 1000 people staged what they called a 
diein in front of the peace parks abomb dome a preserved 
ruin from the atomic attack the group of japanese and foreign 
antinuclear activists protested nuclear arms and appealed for 
peace a representative said 
about 140000 people died in the blast firestorm and radiation 
from the attack on this western japanese city a major military 
center during world war ii 
our country as the sole nation to have suffered an atomic 
attack is determined that the tragedies of hiroshima and nagasaki 
should never be repeated uno told the crowd in the park many 
were dressed in black mourning clothes despite sweltering heat 
three days after the hiroshima attack the united states dropped 
a second atom bomb on the coastal city of nagasaki killing 70000 
people japan surrendered unconditionally aug 15 1945 ending the 
war 
we strongly feel the duty to use hiroshima to sound an alarm 
bell for the future of all humanity uno said from now on 
japan must carry out more aggressive diplomacy for peace and 
security in the world said uno 
he is about to step down as prime minister after a severe 
election setback for his party 
a group of mayors at an international peace conference 
including anne rudin of sacramento calif and herbert schmalstieg 
of hanover west germany placed a wreath of yellow chrysanthemums 
beside a granite tomb dedicated to the bomb victims chrysanthemums 
are a traditional mourning flower 
the people of hiroshima have turned this into a positive thing 
because they have educated the world about the horror of nuclear 
war ms rudin said after the ceremony 
outside hundreds of boy scouts handed visitors fresh flowers 
while protesters passed out leaflets accusing the government of 
laxity in enforcing a policy against allowing us and other 
warships to bring nuclear weapons into japan

airlines are hiring record numbers of pilots 
raising concerns over safety and future shortages of men and women 
to fly military and civilian planes 
large and small carriers have hired 12000 pilots so far this 
year compared to 9800 for all of last year according to the air 
line pilots association 
but not all of the new hires are new pilots many are moving up 
an informal ladder to flying the most sophisticated commercial 
jets resulting in an exodus among military pilots and turnover of 
up to 120 percent a year for small carriers flight schools also 
are seeing more trainers leave to enter the cockpit 
the problem also has increased debate over the mandatory 
retirement of commercial airline pilots at age 60 flight 
experience requirements for pilots who fly passenger jets and the 
loss of billions of dollars in training military pilots who quit to 
join airlines that have no training programs of their own 
the military and the regional airlines together continue to 
supply a large share of the major airline pilot workforce but they 
cannot meet the present or future demand said henry a duffy 
president of the 41000member pilots union 
duffy and other aviation experts testified last week before the 
senate commerce science and transportation subcommittee on 
aviation which is looking into the nations pilot supply 
airline industry analysts estimate that between 40000 and 
60000 new pilots will be needed over the next decade 
duffy said the military is losing 1000 more pilots a year than 
it trains 
karen keesling air force assistant secretary said that if the 
loss of trained military pilots is not stopped the air force will 
have a shortage of 2800 pilots in five years and will lose several 
billions of dollars in training 
sen john mccain rariz suggested that major airlines should 
pay the cost of training military pilots who leave to fly passenger 
planes he also said the industry and the government should explore 
the possibility of retaining older experienced pilots who now have 
to retire at 60 
john s fredericksen of the regional airline association said 
that small carriers have to replace an average of 40 percent of 
their pilots each year with some having to replace all of them 
all commuters enthusiastically seek out qualified pilots who 
have no interest in a major airline career he said adding that 
some companies are hiring pilots with relatively low total flying 
time 
small carriers and charter airlines pay beginning flight crew 
salaries as low as under 20000 a year while pilots for major 
airlines can earn over 100000 
john d odegard head of the university of north dakotas 
governmentsubsidized aerospace school which trains pilots said 
the need for pilots is staggering 
massive pilot retirements fewer exmilitary pilots and 
explosive industry growth growth which is expected to double to 
one billion enplanements by the turn of the century are causing 
the turnover and the threat of a pilot shortage odegard told 
subcommittee 
this turnover and its resulting decline in the relative 
experience levels of pilots is beginning to raise serious questions 
about maintaining air safety odegard said 
he noted that young military pilots are put at the controls of 
the worlds most sophisticated jet aircraft after only 250 hours of 
experience newly hired jetliner pilots averaged 1500 hours last 
year but this was down from about 2500 in 1981 
some aviation experts propose that performance levels rather 
than flight experience should be the major factor in hiring 
i believe a program of concentrated and professionally 
structured training can be an effective substitute for inflight 
experience said kenneth l tallman a retired air force general 
who is president of the embryriddle aeronautical university in 
florida 
tallman said enrollments in pilot training programs are 
approaching record levels but after training a young pilot is 
cast into the great unknown 
he said there is no structured path for a pilot to follow to a 
job as airliner pilot one young pilot following a typical path 
worked flying banners hauled night freight carried daily 
newspapers and flew a commuter service to accumulate enough hours 
to be hired by a major airline he said 
the nation needs a civilian flight training program backed by 
the federal aviation administration tallman said

more than a few eyebrows were raised at the 
natural resources defense council when word filtered in that a book 
detailing the activist environmental groups work was being peddled 
for 1500 a copy to big business 
i find this a little odd said paul allen spokesman for the 
council 
a washington consulting firm mongoven biscoe amp duchin mailed 
solicitations to corporations last week offering a report on the 
group and promising information and analysis on its leaders 
issues and methods 
ronald a duchin a veteran public relations executive who 
formerly was a spokesman for the pentagon said all the information 
is gleaned by his firm from public sources such as newspapers 
annual reports and other publications 
we dont monitor them because theyre evil he said we 
monitor them because our clients need information about whats on 
their agenda 
whatever the motivation his firm is operating in a relatively 
new and apparently growing area of research and management 
consulting for corporate clients who want to know what 
environmental or social activists are up to 
the report was offered duchins solicitation said to 
corporations that might be concerned with the nrdcs involvement 
in environmental public policy issues 
allen quickly learned of the report from friends who had been 
offered the chance to buy it last week 
he called the consulting firm to see what was going on duchin 
its senior vice president brought over a free copy 
the firm established last year offers what it describes as 
public policy intelligence on activists in environmental 
animal rights and consumer organizations as well as citizens 
groups groups opposing biotechnology and even churches 
mbd maintains extensive files on individuals and organizations 
all from public sources and is able to provide timely information 
and assessment of their activities and plans the firm said in a 
description duchin mailed with the solicitation 
duchin said his firm is different from some others however 
because it sticks to public sources of information and engages in 
no spying infiltration or corporate espionage 
we monitor them we make it our business to learn as much as 
we can about them duchin said 
the targets of their research generally would be described as 
liberal although duchin said there was no intent to focus only on 
the left 
he said his firm has scrutinized national church organizations 
including the united church of christ and the united methodist 
church because of their support for animal rights activists and 
other activities 
he said his clients include large chemical companies but he 
would not identify them they pay monthly retainers of 3500 to 
9000 a month to be kept informed on certain issues and groups he 
said 
the mailing on the nrdc went to 125 companies he said he 
expects 20 or 25 to buy the onetime report and perhaps other 
services the report went free to regular clients 
allen says the natural resources defense council still is trying 
to decide what to make of it but there is something vaguely 
sinister about it 
the report he said was generally flattering in describing the 
groups effectiveness although it misspelled the names of some 
officials 
he disagreed only on the reports conclusions that the groups 
reputation had been damaged by the shortlived alar scar which was 
triggered by the nrdcs report on the use of pesticides in apples 
i guess im a little off put by the implication here that 
theres something about us that needs to be revealed allen said 
do they have a right to do this sure i suppose 
the council is a large environmentalist orgaization more 
establishmentminded than some other activist groups and its 
lawyers are engaged in litigation aimed at protecting the 
environment 
allen said he saw no evidence there was anything other than 
public sources used most of the information seemed to come from 
the groups annual reports he said 
the price perplexes me more than anything else allen said

a few steps from the imposing zurich 
national museum where visitors browse through switzerlands 
history passersby are confronted with the countrys most pressing 
problem 
platzspitz park once a favorite picnic spot has become the 
gathering point for drug addicts in this country one of the 
worlds wealthiest which has virtually no unemployment but one of 
the highest drug addiction rates in the world 
most tourists admiring alpine views and shopping for watches or 
chocolate are unaware of the problem and many swiss failed for 
years to grasp its size 
but a recent killing in platzspitz shocked the country an 
addict was tied up gagged and drowned following an argument over a 
piece of chocolate 
whats wrong with switzerland are we too welloff have our 
young people really lost all sense of where they are going said 
blick the countrys topcirculation tabloid 
in 1988 there were 205 drug deaths in switzerland figures for 
the first half of this year suggest a sharp increase 
neighboring west germany with a population 10 times that of 
switzerlands 65 million had only three times as many 
drugrelated deaths 
in searching for solutions an independent commission set up by 
the swiss government has recommended legalizing possession and 
consumption of small amounts of drugs 
punishing addicts for harming their health does not achieve 
anything they need help commission president francois von der 
linde said in a recent interview 
but he said suggestions to relax drug laws find little support 
in other countries the swiss government has yet to reply to the 
recommendations but arthur grob of the zurich police narcotics 
department dismissed them as impossible and unworkable 
the swiss justice ministry says most drugs smuggled into 
switzerland are heroin from turkey and cocaine from south america 
dr werner fuchs of the zurich aids intervention project is 
pessimistic 
there is no solution to the drug problem he told the 
associated press instead he said officials should work on 
containing the spread of the aids virus among switzerlands 10000 
to 15000 heroin addicts 
switzerland has the highest aids rate in europe with 1221 cases 
per million people ahead of france with 1153 according to the 
world health organization nearly a third of the 806 aids cases 
reported in switzerland by march were intravenous drug users half 
of the 806 victims were homosexual or bisexual males 
fuchs works with doctors nurses social workers and volunteers 
who operate 16 hours a day at platzspitz they provide needles 
free aids tests meals washing facilities and advice to those who 
will listen 
zurich city councilors have authorized the free distribution of 
syringes in the park to counter the spread of aids fuchs says when 
the weather is fine his team hands out as many as 5000 new 
syringes a day in exchange for used ones 
park benches are filled with young people some are asleep some 
stare vacantly into space others inject heroin no one bothers 
about onlookers a young girl wanders around eating a piece of 
cake her face is covered with boils her arms and legs are scarred 
with the marks of drug abuse 
around a fountain at the parks center stand a few tables 
makeshift bases for the dealers nearby are two huge garbage 
containers filled with empty soda cans beer bottles and thousands 
of syringe wrappers 
grob claims platzspitz encourages addiction and acts as a magnet 
to people because they know they can get food syringes and medical 
care 
the squares population can reach 500 on weekends 
martin a selfdescribed volunteer who refused to give his last 
name is scornful of passersby and tourists who regard the addicts 
as freaks 
the other day a busload of japanese tourists stopped near the 
park they all got out and took photos of us as if we were caged 
zoo animals he said 
a barber by training martin offers haircuts and tints for 3 
and entertains the crowd with an accordion 
though violence is not uncommon in the drug scene even police 
were shocked when the bound and gagged body of 23yearold addict 
rolf von arx was fished out of the river flowing by the park his 
two attackers admitted he was still alive when they tossed him into 
the water after an argument over a bar of chocolate and a spilled 
drink 
local magistrate helene wormser told journalists platzspitz 
has seen fights and shootings but no one before has thought of 
drowning a fellow human like a cat

bouncin with bud an evening of music by 
the pianist bud powell which built from the ethereal to the fast 
and furious was a delightful revelation 
saturday nights concert at alice tully hall was the second of 
six in this seasons classical jazz at lincoln center series 
the evening was all music without spoken information about 
powell the most important piano architect of early bebop powell 
died at 41 in 1966 judging from the enthusiam of the audience 
they knew all about powell and were thrilled to be hearing his 
infrequently played compositions anybody present who didnt know 
powells music was shown a new and wide world of music 
the evening began with two tunes played by pianist barry harris 
who is the foremost player of the music of thelonious monk tadd 
dameron and powell oblivion and dusk in saudi were 
introspective as delicate as a daydream wafting through blue 
skies ruminations on emotions long since calmed 
then pianist tommy flanagan whose graceful but authoritative 
style was influenced by powell came on to play a brief set the 
lilting celia fast cheery and emphatic so sorry please 
and bouncin with bud where long phrases which make one smile 
with their joy revealed powells amazing melodic gift 
pianist walter davis jr played the percussive solo glass 
enclosure which shows powells classical training both the 
writing and playing style evoked stern angry 20thcentury russian 
composers 
davis introduced alto saxophonist jackie mclean and said proudly 
that powell called them his disciples they played ill keep 
loving you where the piano plays background chords then they 
were joined by bassist ray drummond and drummer kenny washington 
for buds sure thing with scorching solos for everybody 
powell intended to write for a band but never did so davis 
trombonist slide hampton and tenor saxophonist jimmy heath arranged 
two tunes each bright brassy and beautiful for a distinguished 
10piece band for this concert 
players were trumpeters art farmer and earl gardner hampton 
french horn player john clark tuba player bob stewart mclean 
heath drummond and washington with harris and davis taking turns 
on piano 
they played the spinning parisien thoroughfare strictly 
confidential hallucination roiling with inner rhythms then 
sliding into dissonance time waits with its slow sad 
introduction leading into milder dissonance dance of the 
infidels with solos for french horn trombone and tuba and 
tempis fugit full of urgent jazz spirit and feel 
harris forgot his reading glasses and was loaned a pair by a man 
in the front row 
the eminently solid concert ended with more audience 
participation a standing ovation

parts of the midwest remain in the grip 
of extreme drought but timely rains have kept fields green in much 
of the nations grain belt even if little or none of the moisture 
is being stored in the soil 
this is our second year living from rain shower to rain 
shower our whole family financial condition rests on the next 
rain said mark nagle who raises corn and soybeans eight miles 
southwest of mason city in north central iowa you kind of wonder 
how long it can go 
extreme drought lingers in most of iowa and north dakota and in 
parts of illinois kansas michigan minnesota missouri nebraska 
south dakota and wisconsin according to the national weather 
service thats according to a weather service index that takes 
into consideration soil conditions and longterm precipitation 
the bullseye seems to be in iowa said wayne ellingson of 
the weather services des moines office 
drought disasters were declared this summer for north dakota and 
half the counties of south dakota in april an emergency 
proclamation was issued by iowas governor so the national guard 
could help haul water to communities in six southern counties 
as far as im concerned the drought of 1988 has never 
ended said john enz north dakotas state climatologist 
even if the heavierthannormal rain predicted for the next 90 
days over part of the grain belt actually falls it will take 18 
months to two years for groundwater to be replenished in the 
central plains said norton strommen a weather expert at the us 
department of agriculture in washington 
weve got a long way to go said strommen chief 
meteorologist at the usdas world agricultural outlook board 
in iowa statewide average rainfall totaled just 1365 inches in 
the first seven months of the year that was only 69 percent of the 
normal 1967 inches and made it the eighth driest 
januarythroughjuly period in records that go back 117 years 
that was far better than the 974 inches of rain less than 
half the norm received during the first seven months of last year 
the driest on record but it still created plenty of problems for 
farmers 
phil kruse another iowa farmer said that up to last week rain 
had missed his farm and corn leaves were turning pale and curling 
up to preserve moisture weve had dry spells but nothing like 
this said kruse who grows corn soybeans oats and hay and has 
a dairy herd near waucoma in northeast iowa 
last year drought reduced his corn yields to about a third of 
normal and his soybean harvest to around half normal he got by 
with drought assistance reserve hay and proceeds from hog 
operations that have since been discontinued 
but friday night 1 inches of rain fell on the farm and by 
saturday everything started looking greener said kruses 
wife rosemary 
boy was that nice she said he looked at the rain gauge 
a couple of times and had me look at it he didnt believe it 
even with the increased rain only 1 percent of iowas subsoil 
its reserves for plant growth in dry periods is deemed to have 
adequate moisture 
ohio and indiana where crops shriveled last summer had so much 
rain this spring that planting was delayed as a result 
pollination now is running behind schedule leaving those crops 
vulnerable if hit by a blast of hot weather this month said larry 
van mier of the usdas economic research service in washington 
but crops still are flourishing in most fields even though soil 
moisture reserves are low 
kansas is rebounding from a drought earlier this year that cut 
the winter wheat crop to its smallest in 23 years more than half 
of kansas corn and soybeans are rated in excellent condition this 
summer and more than 60 percent of the subsoil has adequate 
moisture 
van mier said it appears that among the 17 states that account 
for 94 percent of the nations corn production yields this year 
will be far better than 1988 when they averaged about 82 bushels 
an acre with normal rains through fall harvest yields should rise 
above 118 bushels an acre but not quite to the 1196bushel level 
of 1987 he said 
nagle the iowa farmer knows first hand the importance of 
getting rain at the right time 
thats what salvaged a normal harvest for his farm in 1988 when 
blistering heat and extreme drought fried crops in the field 
throughout much of the midwest 
this year with timely rains well have another normal 
harvest he said you dodge the bullet so often you think 
youre immune

a company that acquires lucrative franchises 
for airport dutyfree stores has become a bigleague lobbying force 
in washington trying to curry favor with house ethics committee 
chairman julian dixon and others 
dixons wife betty has a stake in a highyielding joint 
venture with duty free shoppers group ltd to run the dutyfree 
shops at the los angeles international airport 
the dixons acknowledge on financial disclosure reports that they 
have made at least 150000 in two years off an initial investment 
of 15000 or less 
extensive activity by lobbyists from patton boggs amp blow a law 
firm hired by the san franciscobased company is outlined in 
papers on file with the justice departments office of foreign 
agents registration 
duty free shoppers is one of more than 100 clients represented 
by patton boggs a highpowered firm that bears the name of tommy 
boggs son of rep lindy boggs dla 
many of the firms clients are giants in their fields sony 
corp of america may department stores mci telecommunications to 
name a few 
but the duty free shoppers account also kept the lobbyists 
busy and boggs personally handled many of the contacts according 
to interviews and documents 
the company paid patton boggs more than 14 million in the 
fouryear period through 1988 a fee viewed as substantial by other 
washington lobbyists thats a nicesized account said edward 
van kloberg a lobbyist with a number of foreign clients 
the documents paint a picture of patton boggs staff frequently 
on the telephone or in meetings with legislators their staffs and 
executive branch officials from the customs service and the 
departments of transportation or commerce agencies that have roles 
in regulating dutyfree shops at airports 
besides dixon sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the 
senate finance committee house ways and means chairman dan 
rostenkowski dill sens daniel k inouye dhawaii ted 
stevens ralaska and spark matsunaga dhawaii are among the 
scores of capital power players contacted on behalf of duty free 
shoppers the reports show 
they were pretty good lobbyists for anybody they had former 
rep cecil heftel dhawaii said of patton boggs 
they knew how to deal with the facts but in a way that was 
favorable to their client said heftel who left office in 1986 
to run unsuccessfully for governor in his home state 
although heftel said he routinely declined social functions paid 
for by lobbyists others didnt 
in 1985 for instance the lobbyists charged duty free shoppers 
1480 for a dinner for inouye the documents show 
henry giugni inouyes former administrative assistant and now 
the senate sergeant at arms was the only other government 
official who attended sen inouyes dinner the documents show 
on another occasion march 11 1986 ronald h brown a lawyer 
for patton boggs and now the chairman of the democratic national 
committee bought dinner for dixon dcalif and two other friends 
dixon who says he never talked about duty free shoppers with 
brown recalled that there was a brief struggle concerning the 
187 bill after dinner ron insisted he treat and did so 
brown said two other contacts he listed with dixon on behalf of 
duty free shoppers were mostly social occasions three of the 
occasions were dinners 
it was at one of those events a feb 26 1986 party thrown by 
patton boggs that betty dixon apparently learned about the duty 
free shoppers investment possibility dixon said 
on the same day patton boggs officials reported lobbying reps 
barbara boxer dcalif don young ralaska daniel akaka 
dhawaii heftel and stevens for duty free shoppers 
stuart pape one of the lawyers who handled duty free shoppers 
business said it wouldnt be uncommon to lobby a variety of 
lawmakers if you judged that he would be important or 
sympathetic or indeed antagonistic 
boggs did not return telephone calls to talk about the business 
patton boggs dealt with legislation relating to dutyfree 
bonded warehouses us pacific trust territory relationships tax 
and other revenue matters according to legislative reports filed 
with the house 
duty free shoppers incorporated in bermuda is a worldwide 
operation with concessions to operate shops at airports in 
honolulu san francisco anchorage alaska and boston mass 
among other places 
it has sales of over 1 billion annually mostly from selling 
highpriced goods like perfume and brandname items such as hermes 
ties and gucci shoes to international travelers 
besides hiring patton boggs duty free shoppers is a member of 
the international association of airport duty free stores a trade 
association with about 50 members 
david h bernstein the associations president said the 
industry grew up in the 1950s to serve travelers who can avoid 
duties on items they purchase for consumption outside the united 
states 
the more than 125 duty free stores nationwide generate about 1 
billion in revenues with some of that money going to subsidize 
airports 
duty free sales enterprises benefit the united states in a 
number of ways akaka said in a statement not only do they pay 
concession fees to airports they induce foreign visitors to 
increase their overall expenditures in the united states the 
congressman from hawaii said 
in 1986 akaka introduced legislation that established 
guidelines for dutyfree stores including where they can be 
located the measure was incorporated in the 1988 omnibus trade 
bill

an estranged couples fight over the 
fate of seven fertilized human eggs goes to court monday and may 
provide a legal precedent in cases where technology has bent the 
traditional course of parenthood 
junior lewis davis is seeking to prevent his wife mary sue 
davis from attempting to become pregnant with any of the eggs now 
that they are getting divorced davis who filed for divorce in 
february says he no longer wants to have a child with her 
the eggs were taken from mrs davis and fertilized with davis 
sperm in an invitro fertilization program the couple entered at a 
knoxville hospital six years ago in hopes of having a socalled 
testtube baby 
i consider them life mrs davis 28 said shortly after her 
husband filed for divorce she has said that the eggs are the 
result of years of surgery tests and selfadministered injections 
and are her best chance at having a child i would love to be a 
mother she said 
she also said she would consider raising the child by herself 
and not asking for child support 
davis 30 countered at the time that it would be unsettling 
to know that 10 years from now i could be walking down the 
street and bump into my child and not know it 
invitro fertilization was first used successfully in 1978 with 
the birth in england of louise brown eggs are surgically removed 
from a womans ovary and combined with sperm in the laboratory the 
resulting fertilized egg is then implanted in the womans uterus in 
hopes a normal pregnancy will result other fertilized eggs can be 
frozen for later attempts 
mrs davis says she had five tubal pregnancies after the couple 
was married in 1979 one resulting in a ruptured fallopian tube 
surgery was done to tie the other tube before the davises entered 
the invitro program administered by dr i ray king 
there were originally nine fertilized eggs two were 
unsuccessfully implanted before the couples marriage broke down 
the davises did not sign a contract specifying what should be 
done with the embryos if circumstances changed such as a divorce 
or the death of one or both of them king says that was an 
oversight but he added that any such agreement probably could be 
contested in court anyway 
but the lack of a contract leaves blount county district court 
judge w dale young with no prior agreement on which to base his 
decision and with little legal guidance attorneys for both 
parties said in briefs there was no legal precedent they could cite 
to help guide youngs decision 
there is no legal precedent that says very early embryos are 
legal persons with rights said john a robertson a law 
professor at the university of texas the state of tennessee 
could choose to protect them if it wished but the state hasnt 
done that 
the only state to take such action is believed to be louisiana 
which has a law saying embryos are entitled to the full protection 
of the law and cannot be owned or destroyed 
in the tennessee case charles clifford davis attorney argues 
that the embryos are joint property and can be disposed of like 
other assets in a divorce giving mrs davis sole discretion over 
the embryos would deprive davis of the right to decide whether to 
sire offspring the lawyer argued 
jay christenberry attorney for mrs davis argues that davis is 
trying to reverse a condition as old as adam and eve it has 
never he says been within the mans power to cancel a pregnancy 
once an egg has been fertilized 
these embryos are in cold storage not in mrs davis body but 
even in so primitive a form with only four to eight cells they 
represent potential life mrs davis attorney said 
robertson who has written articles on the legal and ethical 
aspects of invitro fertilization and the rights of embryos is 
expected to be called as a witness by davis attorney he argues 
that the case should be decided in favor of the person who would be 
hurt worse by losing which he says is davis 
it would seem that the party who wished to avoid parenthood 
would be hurt worse if the embryos were used he said the 
other parent can go out and create new embryo and try to have 
children 
however mrs davis chances of trying further invitro 
fertilization could depend on her remarrying chicago attorney lori 
b andrews a specialist in reproductive technology law said she 
knows of no invitro fertilization clinic that will take a single 
woman as a patient

officers at the 1st chaparral missile battalion in roswell he 
started his trek 6 am monday and finished 200 miles later at 
1045 am saturday 
it was a nice walk i got to see new mexico up close real 
slow he said as he rested it was really nice in the early 
morning but it got pretty hot in the afternoon that was 
drudgery

improved its strength and the guard received a lot of positive

americans are spending a smaller share of 
their incomes on food than ever before the agriculture department 
says 
according to the departments food cost review americans 
overall spent 411 billion on food in 1988 118 percent of their 
total disposable personal income 
that is down from 13 percent five years earlier and 135 percent 
in 1978 the departments economic research service says when the 
government began keeping statistics in 1929 nearly 25 percent of 
disposable personal income was spent on food 
that percentage has declined steadily over the years except for 
the 1970s when there was relatively high food price inflation the 
department says 
citing a 1986 survey by the us department of labor the 
agriculture department noted that the percentage of income spent on 
food varies by size and income of family 
aftertax income spent for food varied from 127 percent for 
households with incomes of 3000039000 to 274 percent for 
families with incomes of 50009999 
although much has been said about the growing number of meals 
taken at restaurants and fastfood establishments the share of 
disposable income on food eaten away from home has risen only 
gradually from 32 percent in 1929 to 45 percent in 1988 
expenseaccount meals are excluded 
the agriculture department excludes pet food ice and prepared 
feeds and deducts more for nonfood items such as drugs and 
household supplies in arriving at the food component of grocery 
bills 
the declining percentage of food expenditures in relation to 
rising income was noted by 19th century economist ernest engel the 
report says 
a decline in this percentage reflects a highly developed 
economy in which there is money to spend on personal services and 
other discretionary items the report says some of these 
additional services ordinarily are purchases along with food this 
reasoning largely explains the slight increase in the percentage of 
income spent on food away from home 
so how did farmers make out 
of the 411 billion spent on food 395 billion was spent on 
food produced on american farms the rest was spent on imported 
food and fishery products 
the 395 billion represents a 5 percent increase over the 
previous year and is a record dollar amount spent by consumers on 
food produced in america 
meat products accounted for 29 percent of total expenditures 
followed by 22 percent for fruits and vegetables

conference sunday with a call for congress and president bush to 
roll back recent supreme court decisions that it said were 
anticivil rights 
league president john e jacob said that without action to 
reverse the high courts rulings women and minorities wont be 
allowed to play catchup theyll be stuck with the effects of past 
discrimination 
the court we once looked to as the protector of minority 
rights has itself become a threat to our rights he said 
jacob in a keynote address to the conference cited recent 
court rulings against contracts set aside for minority businesses 
preventing women and minorities from challenging standing seniority 
systems limiting the use of statistics in proving patterns of 
discrimination and putting greater burdens of proof on victims of 
discrimination 
we call on the president and the congress to carefully review 
the courts anticivil rights decisions and to frame corrective 
legislation jacob said 
jacob also announced two new urban league programs to provide 
more minority workers with jobs and to combat drugs in the 
community 
the national workforce development program is designed to help 
workers get the training and counseling they need to obtain jobs 
and to help link them up with employers who are searching for 
qualified people 
we will be able to help corporate america include minorities 
in all of its operations from the factory floor to the executive 
suites jacob said 
the league also said it plans to push for tougher laws against 
drug offenses and for prison sites that keep offenders out of 
communities it said it will organize a nationwide blacks against 
drugs movement to mobilize people against drugs and keep children

a group of jurists and religious figures 
on sunday confirmed ali khamenei to succeed the late ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini as leader of the islamic republic of iran the 
official news agency reported 
as leader khamenei has the power to dismiss the president 
declare war and appoint major officials including military and 
religious leaders he also serves as commander in chief of the 
armed forces 
spiritually he is standing in for the hidden imam or 12th 
religious leader of the dominant shiite moslem sect in iran 
shiites believe he disappeared in the 10th century ad and is 
supposed to return to create a perfect world 
but khamenei 50 a softspoken selfeffacing man is unlikely 
to wield the influence of khomeini who founded the islamic 
republic in 1979 and was revered as a prophet by millions of 
iranians 
khamenei has been serving as president and his term officially 
ends oct 9 
on june 4 a day after the death of khomeini the 83man 
assembly of experts provisionally elected him to succeed khomeini 
as spiritual leader of iran in line with khomeinis wishes 
however official confirmation had to await a referendum july 
28 held along with presidential elections which put a number of 
constitutional changes to the vote 
the changes included abolishing the post of prime minister 
strengthening the role of the president and allowing the leader 
to be chosen from among the second rank of moslem clergymen 
mujtahid or islamic jurists instead of only the first rank of 
marja or paramount islamic clergy 
khamenei is a mujtahid 
the islamic republic news agency reported that khomeini 
citing problems in finding a marja who was also aware of 
political issues necessary for running a state had urged the 
amendment shortly before his death 
in the election the changes were approved by 97 percent of the 
vote the parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani was elected 
president with 95 percent rafsanjani also is deputy speaker of the 
assembly of experts the countrys highest spiritual body 
although rafsanjani will be outranked by khamenei he will 
control the executive machinery of the government the two men are 
believed to get along well 
meanwhile the interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
announced that rafsanjani cannot take over the presidency before 
oct 9 unless khamenei officially resigns 
rafsanjani was reported inaugurated as president by irna last 
thursday but irna quoted mohtashemi as saying legally his 
excellency ayatollah khamenei is the president until the end of his 
term on oct 9 
mohtashemi is a hardliner believed to be at odds with 
rafsanjani who has shown willingness to end irans international 
isolation and moderate its foreign activities and image 
it was unclear whether sundays statement by mohtashemi was an 
attempt to make trouble for rafsanjani who most observers assumed 
had officially taken over the presidency

a littlenoticed effort to freeze housing 
funds to communities guilty of police brutality was inspired partly 
by complaints from antiabortion demonstrators in pittsburgh says 
the measures sponsor 
the freeze amendment by rep robert walker rpa was quietly 
tacked on to a department of housing and urban development 
appropriations bill july 20 by voice vote 
the amendment would bar municipalities from spending community 
development block grants if three or more of their police officers 
were convicted of using unnecessary force against peaceful 
demonstrators 
not only would the freeze require a conviction it would be 
triggered only if it was determined the officers acted on orders 
of superiors 
in an interview friday walker said the amendment was inspired 
partly by a march 11 demonstration in which several protesters from 
the antiabortion group operation rescue claimed they were 
brutalized by police and county jail guards 
no charges have been filed but the us civil rights commission 
has said it will look into the incident 
walker said he hoped the amendment which cannot become law 
without senate concurrence will get the attention of pittsburgh 
officials 
to suggest pittsburgh was the only reason for this is to 
misrepresent the situation walker said no doubt it would 
apply to operation rescue and they were fully supportive of the 
amendment but the amendment speaks about civil rights 
demonstrators in general and is particularly aimed at a policy in 
some communities of using pain as a way of handling nonviolent 
demonstrations 
the only house member to argue against the amendment on the 
floor was rep bill green rny who said it was confusing and 
would set a bad precedent 
green said he was concerned about what would happen if for 
example someone comes up to the secretary of hud as he is 
entering the hud building and says psst buddy three police 
officers in altoona have been convicted under the circumstances of 
the walker amendment 
at that point the secretary must withhold funds from altoona 
and i think it is a dangerous amendment a dangerous precedent 
green said 
pittsburgh officials have been lobbying against the amendment 
which they term ambiguous 
we can understand the desire of a member of congress to insure 
the right of any citizen to peacefully protest perceived 
injustice said a july 31 letter to sen john heinz rpa from 
pittsburgh mayor sophie masloff and tom foerster chairman of the 
allegheny county commissioners 
however there are any number of remedies in both federal and 
state agencies available to a citizen who feels that unnecessary 
violence was used against him or her it is unfair to burden 
pittsburgh or other cities and municipalities with the potential of 
losing these vital federal funds

it was like something in a horror movie 
9yearold jessica short was visiting a street festival when she 
was grabbed suddenly from behind and stabbed to death by an escaped 
mental patient as her mother and dozens of others watched 
a week later the story still haunts connecticut kept on 
newspapers front pages by a second escape from the same hospital 
and by troubling questions about security at the states mental 
institutions 
mental health officials who at first protested that they were 
running hospitals not prisons have now moved to tighten security 
around the states small population of criminally insane mental 
patients 
but the new security has done little to comfort residents and 
officials in middletown who have lived for years in an uneasy 
peace with connecticut valley hospital a 120yearold brick 
complex that houses many of the states 172 criminally insane 
patients 
people who walk with their children on main street in 
middletown hold their children closer now because of the 
incident said mayor sebastian garafalo 
on july 28 david peterson a paranoid schizophrenic walked 
away from the hospital where he was confined last year after 
attacking a neighbor he stabbed jessica to death apparently 
choosing her at random from among fairgoers on a crowded sidewalk 
i absolutely blame the hospital said vincent amato a 
middletown merchant who else could you blame they were charged 
by society to take care of this man who had a problem they 
failed 
some mental health workers worry the incident has bred what one 
official called a kind of hysteria against thousands of 
harmless mentally ill people 
they are not a danger to anyone but the public puts all of 
them in the same category that they are to be feared said edna 
jacobs president of the connecticut alliance for the mentally ill 
the public doesnt understand the nature of mental illness 
she worried that backlash from the killing could slow or even 
reverse the states efforts to make mental health treatment more 
humane 
peterson 37 was sent to the state mental hospital system in 
february 1988 by a superior court judge who found him not guilty by 
reason of insanity in the nonfatal stabbing of a neighbor he was 
being treated under minimal security at merrit hall a section of 
connecticut valley hospital where patients are given certain 
privileges based on their competence and behavior 
at about noon the day of the stabbing peterson got permission 
to go to the hospital library but instead left the unlocked 
building and walked off the hospital grounds unnoticed according 
to police and hospital officials 
he took a bus downtown where he bought a hunting knife for 
3695 and blended into a crowd of hundreds at the street fair 
just before 3 pm he grabbed jessica in front of an fw 
woolworth store and began stabbing her in the face and chest the 
attack lasted less than a minute the darkhaired girl was dead a 
halfhour later 
peterson who is charged with murder is now being held in a 
maximumsecurity section of the middletown hospital 
petersons relatives guessed he may have acted out of rage at 
his doctors through years of treatment for mental illness the 
family said he has distrusted doctors and feared the medication 
they prescribed would give him cancer they also said he should 
have been watched more closely 
my brother should have been locked up said his sister 
diane maynard they should lock him up and throw away the key 
something always happens 
the victims family aside from a brief statement thanking 
people for their compassion hasnt commented publicly on the case 
the decision to put peterson into a relatively free section of 
the hospital complex had been made by the states psychiatric 
security review board a 5yearold panel created to ensure that 
decisions about criminally insane patients are not based on a 
single doctors recommendation 
since the attack the department of mental health has ordered 
tighter security including locked doors at all wards where 
criminally insane patients are treated the system of privileges is 
under scrutiny sweeping regulatory or legislative changes are 
expected 
no system will ever be mistakefree said paul gionfriddo a 
state representative from middletown when a mistake happens 
and we had a tragic one a week ago you try to create a system 
that is one step better than the one you had before 
garafalo the middletown mayor has suggested that patients with 
criminal histories be forced to wear electronic tracking bracelets 
the statement has been made that the mental hospital is not 
a prison its a hospital garafalo said well for those who 
are criminally committed it should be a prison with treatment

space shuttle managers sunday 
pronouced columbia ready for flight and directed a hushhush 
countdown to continue toward a tuesday launch with five astronauts 
and a secret military satellite 
the goahead followed a threehour readiness review of all 
aspects of the mission including the orbiter weather and the 
global tracking network nasa administrator richard truly sat in on 
the mission management team review 
there are no open items and there is nothing now that will 
hold up the launch nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said after the 
meeting of launch officials 
because the mission is classified the space agency remained 
silent on the exact status of the countdown it has said only that 
liftoff is scheduled between 730 am and 1130 am tuesday 
there also will be a news blackout throughout the flight on what 
the astronauts are doing 
the defense department has determined that the longer we can 
keep the the launch time and the type of payload under wraps the 
less chance anyone has of tracking it and learning what it is 
said ken warren an air force spokesman 
published reports and sources who requested anonymity have said 
the astronauts will launch a sophisticated reconnaissance satellite 
to gather intelligence data over much of the soviet union china 
the middle east and other areas of the globe of military interest 
warren said the only weather concern for tuesday was the 
possibility of clouds lingering in the area from overnight

2yearold sister drowned 
three other people were killed and 18 wounded in overnight 
shelling duels and clashes across beiruts dividing green line a 
police spokesman said by police count 542 people have been killed 
and 2284 wounded since the latest round of fighting erupted march

the boat ferrying passengers from the port of jounieh to a 
cyprusbound hovercraft capsized when a syrian battery fired 40 
rockets into the sea crew members from the hovercraft lowered life 
rafts and picked up six passengers and another eight were rescued 
by a fishing boat 
wed come under heavy fire i believe we were their 
target navigation officer cesar abi aql said in larnaca cyprus 
we dropped the rafts and four of us went to the rescue i saw the 
baby girls but i had another passenger clinging to me when i 
went back theyd disappeared 
the sisters were identified as maya nabil azar and her 
2yearold sister roba 
the hovercraft the norwegianregistered santa maria makes a 
daily run to jounieh to pick up passengers from the christian 
enclave north of beirut 
it usually anchors 300 yards offshore to avoid syrian shellfire 
and passengers come aboard from smaller craft 
the santa maria arrived in larnaca with 320 passengers shipping 
agent tony mansour said 
syrian gunners bombard the enclaves coastline daily to prevent 
supplies of weapons and fuel from reaching the christians 
the latest round in lebanons 14yearold civil war broke out 
when lebanese army commander gen michel aoun blockaded illegal 
ports operated by syrianbacked moslem militias that deny the state 
treasury 100 million a year 
syrian troops joined their militia allies in fighting aouns 
mainly christian troops and besieging the christian enclave 
a beirut police spokesman said the syrians started shelling 
saturday night as a ship with food neared the christian port of 
byblos and a tanker approached nearby amsheet 
aouns gunners struck back at syrian batteries the duels later 
dwindled into random bombardment said the spokesman who cannot be 
named under standing rules 
he said syrian and christian troops also staged hitandrun 
grenade attacks along the threemile line dividing the capital as 
their tanks blasted each others positions

overlooking the capital 
the reinforcements arrived amid rumors that aouns 20000 troops 
might storm west beirut to seize lebanons central bank where most 
of the nations hard currency and gold reserves are stored 
around 40000 syrian troops have been stationed in lebanon since 
1976 under a peacekeeping mandate from the arab league aoun 
charges the syrians betrayed their mandate by siding with the 
moslems in their fight to share power with the traditionally 
dominant christians who are a minority in the country

under such titles as blood was shed here and 
young woman i grieve for you beijing residents have been 
submitting progovernment accounts of the citys recent turmoil to 
an essay contest 
in blood was shed here xu dingjiang wrote that he watched 
soldiers with tears in their hearts and guns in their hands 
restrain themselves from firing on a crowd that torched their 
vehicles 
niu hui wrote about a neighbor who reported that soldiers turned 
tiananmen square the center of seven weeks of prodemocracy 
protests into a crematorium for protesters they killed 
i think after she saw the television video and understood the 
true situation she was very embarrassed niu wrote 
niu xu and the other entrants whose works began appearing in 
the tabloid beijing evening news last week are competing for 
undisclosed prizes to be given in november 
eight other papers or television stations are helping sponsor 
the contest 
the only requirements are that the stories touch the soul 
and be true 
what is true about the tumultuous events that led to the june 
34 military crackdown remains a matter of controversy 
all entries published so far stick closely to the official 
version which says soldiers acted with restraint and that only 
about 300 people died including dozens of soldiers 
western observers including hundreds of journalists said the 
army fired wildly at crowds and buildings and that the death toll 
may have been in the thousands 
the contest reflects the voracious appetite of the official 
media for commentaries letters and essays on what it calls the 
quelling of the counterrevolutionary rebellion 
the media apparently convinced that previous crackdowns on 
dissent and liberal thought ended too quickly are hanging on this 
time despite a notable slackening of public interest 
many beijing residents said they watched the first television 
documentary on the protests several weeks ago a fourpart series 
but three more documentaries have been aired since the latest 
sunday night and many people chose not to watch them 
i have better things to do said one local shopkeeper 
its too exhausting all this politics the same thing all the 
time said a chinese reporter 
some readers also are wondering about the real effects of 
publishing so many reminiscences many columns criticizing ousted 
party chief zhao ziyang for example have accused him of such 
liberalism that he is becoming more popular to ordinary chinese 
than he ever was in office 
it turns out zhao was pretty good one worker said after 
attending a political study class at which zhao was criticized 
on saturday after chinese authorities jammed incoming voice of 
america radio signals for weeks the official beijing daily 
splashed its reports all over its front page the paper called it 
an exhibit of the us governmentrun stations false news 
reports but it did not censor out phrases such as the chinese 
peoples liberation armys bloody massacre of protesters demanding 
democracy 
it appears they are being criticized but really their message 
is getting across said the chinese reporter

as workers prepared to pour the foundation 
for the vietnam veterans memorial in 1982 someone asked if he 
could leave a servicemans purple heart in the concrete 
that simple gesture was the start of what is now an enormous 
collection of keepsakes left to the memory of the more than 58000 
servicemen and women named on the stark black monument that has 
become known as the wall 
military items pictures trinkets flags hundreds of teddy 
bears walking canes and beer cans and a pair of black lace panties 
are among the things that appear daily along the base of the 
memorial in washington 
they are carefully collected and catalogued by national park 
service rangers and end up in a government repository in suburban 
lanham 
the meaning behind the military insignia is obvious the 
relevance of other objects less so among the items left were 
candle shaped like a corn cob a cross with a barbedwire ring and 
countless earrings necklaces and other jewelry there are record 
albums by dionne warwick and wes montgomery and a tape of songs by 
the carpenters 
and flags hundreds of flags in all sizes 
this is strictly a collection that the public has initiated 
said steve m bavisotto who until recently was in charge of 
cataloging each of the mementos and ensuring their preservation 
bavisotto left the park service in july for a job at the armys 
center for military history but he still volunteers time to the 
collection 
its a very good representation of our culture he said 
its things that are important to americans 
people who leave keepsakes at the wall dont know theyll be 
part of a historical collection 
bavisotto believes some items were left by people who felt they 
wanted to make a gesture but had nothing to share except what they 
had with them 
its spontaneous bavisotto said its a spontaneous 
reaction to being there 
theres no rhyme or reason to the panties we can only 
speculate says deury felton a museum technician and a vietnam 
veteran 
each item is preserved in the vietnam veterans memorial 
collection which is kept by the park service 
it was two years before anyone thought about making a permanent 
collection of the keepsakes from 1982 when the memorial was 
dedicated until 1984 they were stored in cardboard boxes in a 
government garage 
park service rangers now pick up items from the wall twice a 
day tagging each and writing a brief description before placing 
them temporarily in vaults at the nearby lincoln memorial as the 
vaults are filled boxes full of objects are taken to the museum 
and archeological research storage repository in lanham a 
climatecontrolled building that houses artifacts from several 
historical collections in the washington area 
the collection from the wall has grown to at least 15000 items 
bavisotto said 
for each item however insignificant it may seem an entry is 
prepared for a computerized catalogue the only items not saved are 
live flowers and other such items 
for felton working with the collection every day evokes 
unpleasant memories of his time in vietnam in the late 1960s but 
he says he wouldnt trade his job 
its an honor he says its something that should be done 
to understand the sacrifices

more than 300 east germans have sought 
refuge in this countrys east bloc embassies in an effort to flee 
to the west news reports said sunday 
the west german news reports emerged at a time when hungarian 
authorities say they may take the once unthinkable step of granting 
political asylum to some east germans 
hungary and east germany are communist allies however 
reformminded hungarian leaders are preparing for nationwide 
multiparty elections while east german officials have stuck to 
hardline policies 
a flood of east germans attempting to leave their homeland 
through hungary has aggravated tension between the countries it 
has also prompted a flurry of diplomatic exchanges between bonn and 
budapest in an effort to resolve the problem 
the west german welt am sonntag newspaper said more than 200 
east germans are living in the west german embassy in budapest it 
said bonn had rented an additional building to house the refugees 
hungary is a popular vacation spot for east germans 
other east germans have sought refuge in bonns missions in east 
berlin and prague czechoslovakia according to the news reports 
they said about 80 east germans were at the mission in east berlin 
and about 20 in prague 
east germanys staterun news agency adn told citizens sunday 
not to seek refuge in west german missions in an attempt to force 
authorities to grant them exit visas it did not say anything about 
punishment for those who ignored the warning 
during democratic reform hungary has dismantled nearly half of 
a 160mile barbedwire barrier along its frontier with austria 
the move has given new hope to many east germans who want to 
emigrate to the west the border between east germany and west 
germany is heavily fortified and guarded by troops attack dogs and 
sophisticated electronic alarm systems 
one hungarian interior ministry official judith toth said last 
week that budapest was considering whether east germans can be 
granted political asylum in hungary thus allowing them to travel 
legally to west germany 
however karoly nagy the head of the interior ministrys 
refugee office said friday that east germans would have to clearly 
show they are victims of political persecution 
he said most east germans caught trying to cross the border into 
austria were not fleeing political persecution but simply seeking a 
better life 
nagy said the problem should be worked out between east and west 
germany 
he confirmed that the passports of east germans stopped while 
trying to make an illegal crossing into austria are stamped by 
hungarian officials 
critics of the practice say it exposes east germans to possible 
prosecution when they return home 
however nagy said the stamp does not indicate that the bearer 
attempted to flee to the west but simply states he was ordered to 
leave hungary 
the bild am sonntag newspaper quoted the countrys foreign 
ministry officials as saying they are trying to get the hungarians 
to drop the practice 
with the mark of cain in their passports many east germans 
face severe reprisals the newspaper quoted a foreign ministry 
official as saying

roundtheclock child care at city fire stations 
would help lure single parents to the department and make it easier 
for firefighters to care for their children during 24hour work 
shifts the fire chief says 
its a unique problem for firefighters fire chief rich 
gonzales said friday for them to have to rely all the time on 
neighbors and grandmothers it becomes a burden 
its difficult to recruit women if theyre single parents 
they want to be firefighters but ask whos going to take care of 
the kids when theyre at the firehouse he said 
gonzales said he knew of no other department in the country with 
such a program a task force of denver firefighters and daycare 
workers probably will be set up to decide the best way to run and 
pay for the program 
neighborhood fire stations would be natural locations for 
24hour child care officials said because they have kitchens 
bedrooms and bathrooms 
the problem would address one of the problems denver has had in 
recruiting women to the department only nine female firefighters 
are on the staff but the latest round of recruiting brought in 
applications from 274 women 
this probably will attract more women said firstyear 
firefighter michelle collins with firefighters on duty for 24 
hours at a time child care is a big problem she said 
firefighters routinely ask to be transferred to eighthouraday 
desk jobs to accommodate growing families but capt charles 
mcmillan of the recruitment unit said such positions arent always 
available 
the department has been sensitive enough to realize people 
have these needs he said if i were in that 24hour period i 
would have to put my daughter in somebody elses care and being a 
parent you always think you give the best care 
gonzales said he would meet this week with his top officers to 
discuss the plan

sunday that indian peacekeeping troops killed 70 people in weekend 
offensives on ethnic tamil rebels in northern areas 
the officials said 29 other people including a buddhist monk 
died friday and saturday in sinhalese radical violence elsewhere 
an indian embassy official confirmed the military offensive but 
said only three tamil rebels were killed in two days 
the sri lankan officials who cannot be identified under 
briefing rules gave few details about either the fighting in 
northern towns and jungles or the other deaths 
however residents in the northern town of vavuniya said by 
telephone that about 70 tamils were killed in gunfire and shelling 
from indian forces 
the residents quoting travelers who arrived in their city said 
23 victims had been identified as civilians the residents spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the indian official who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
said he had no reports of any civilian casualties 
residents in jaffna about 190 miles north of colombo said 40 
homes and 23 shops were destroyed in the shelling other damage was 
in velvettiturai 20 miles north of jaffna they said 
the claims could not be independently confirmed movement in the 
area is restricted by the indian troops who were sent to the 
northeast two years ago to disarm tamil rebels 
the indian troops were deployed under terms of an indiasri 
lanka accord in july 29 1987 the agreement was aimed at ending a 
tamil insurrection for an independent homeland 
sinhalese radicals bitterly oppose the indian presence which 
rose to about 45000 troops in 1987 they launched a violent 
antigovernment campaign killing at least 4000 people 
the sinhalese extremists also say the government gave too many 
concessions to the tamils in the 1987 accord which provided 
limited autonomy in exchange for an arms surrender by tamil 
militias 
the government has also been negotiating with india on a 
withdrawal of indian troops sri lankan officials say they should 
be pulled out quickly but india says a rapid withdrawal could lead 
to more violence 
at least 11000 people have been killed in the 6yearold tamil 
separatist war 
in the latest violence by the sinhalese militants the radicals 
of the leftwing peoples liberation front shot and killed the 
chief priest of a buddhist temple in puttalam 75 miles north of 
colombo a government statement said it did not say on which day 
he was killed 
the slaying of pokunu bandana hemaloka followed thursdays fatal 
shooting of the chief priest of a colombo temple 
tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people many 
tamils say they suffer discrimination at the hands of the 
sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of the population and control 
the government

the official libyan news agency criticized the 
british media sunday for ridiculing col moammar gadhafis 
contention that william shakespeare was of arab origin 
jana monitored in rome also said that any arab ties to 
shakespeare would not increase arab prestige but would be instead 
an honor to the british and shakespeare himself and his family 
the smell of chauvinism seems to have overwhelmed the 
atmosphere of the talk broadcast by the british radio on the 
historical view regarding the attribution of the name of 
shakespeare to arab origins as put forward by brother moammar 
gadhafi jana said in a dispatch titled shakespeare is he 
arab 
the agency said the british media should have used scientific 
analysis in discussing shakespeares origins rather than 
throwing insults and defamation and using description against 
others no civilized mind would accept 
the dispatch attributed the reports in the british media to a 
very strong pressure of zionist egoism which does not recognize the 
right of others to freedom of expression 
three british newspapers ridiculed gadhafi for the assertion a 
fourth the daily telegraph described it as a joke that gadhafi 
had originally told the deputies of the tunisian parliament in 
december

presidents robert mugabe of zimbabwe and 
daniel arap moi of kenya are set to meet monday for talks aimed at 
ending the 12yearold civil war in mozambique 
about 100000 people mostly civilians have been killed in the 
war which has made refugees of another 16 million people and 
ruined the economy of the southern african nation 
mugabe and moi are expected to confer with afonso dhlakama 
leader of the rebel mozambique national resistance and mozambican 
church leaders representing the government 
the rebel and government delegations are not expected to meet 
but to exchange proposals through the mediating presidents 
mugabe on saturday announced the visit to compare notes with 
moi after he met in the zimbabwean capital of harare with president 
joaquim chissano of mozambique details of their discussions were 
not released 
last month mugabe said chissano asked him to join moi in trying 
to negotiate an end to the war 
the mozambique government representatives roman catholic and 
protestant members of the mozambique christian council reportedly 
are carrying a 12point peace plan from chissano but details have 
not been made public 
dhlakama and the church delegation arrived in nairobi late last 
week they originally were to meet in kenyas capital last month 
but dhlakama failed to arrive 
the rebels initially rejected the mediation of zimbabwe which 
has about 12000 soldiers fighting alongside mozambican government 
forces to protect rail links and an oil pipeline from the indian 
ocean 
the rebels formerly were backed by the whiteruled government 
south africa in their fight to oust the marxist maputo government 
but they no longer have open support from any government and are 
widely accused of atrocities against civilians

the close of the supreme soviets first session 
ended a dramatic five months in which workers and upstart 
politicians aided by mikhail s gorbachev shook a welloiled 
machines stranglehold on political power 
officials who dominated soviet life for more than a halfcentury 
took an unprecedented bashing beginning with march elections 
through july coal miners strikes and the final days of the 
legislative session that ended friday 
the party undoubtedly still is the strongest force in society 
and gorbachevs authority is not questioned but those who 
traditionally have wielded power were left dazed and unsure 
dozens were humiliated in their first competitive elections 
some were exposed to the fury of miners who cannot buy enough soap 
a halfdozen others were rejected by the supreme soviet for cabinet 
jobs 
new deputies criticized gorbachev rewrote tax and labor laws 
and even suggested vladimir i lenin be removed from his mausoleum 
on red square 
deputies literally burst onto the podium with their platforms 
program proposals accusations premier nikolai i ryzhkov told 
a recent party meeting but the politburo ended up over on the 
side in some kind of isolated state as if some paralysis syndrome 
were at work 
a real and mighty power has appeared the congress of 
peoples deputies and the supreme soviet and we cannot refuse to 
come to grips with it he said if the party does not find a 
way out of this situation it may lose its influence in running the 
government 
it was small consolation that 85 percent of deputies are party 
members like never before they are unconstrained by a strict 
party line 
former candidate politburo member boris n yeltsin turned his 
rocky relationship with the party into a populist campaign against 
incompetence and special privilege a week ago several hundred 
deputies helped him form the first organized parliamentary 
opposition in 70 years 
regional officials plead for direction from gorbachev 
its time to clearly determine where is the limit of party and 
government discipline and where is pluralism of opinion said 
absamat masaliev party chief in the central asian republic of 
kirghizia 
moscow party leader lev n zaikov said lack of direction has 
upset many local party organizations that have reacted by doing 
nothing 
since the time of lenin a clear purpose and strong organization 
have meant power for the communist party 
today many officials are confused and hesitant 
how has this come about gorbachev mused a party 
organization consisting of thousands with its own newspapers its 
own professional staff with everything at its disposal finds the 
initiative slipping out of its grasp 
instead of providing a detailed party line he has proved 
willing even to side with critics 
it was gorbachev who masterminded the electoral system that 
embarrassed dozens of key party officials 
the strike by hundreds of thousands of miners reiterated that 
common people are taking to heart gorbachevs call to action this 
spasm of unrest for the first time was based on something all 
soviets have in common the poor state of the economy 
gorbachev sympathized with the strikers and promised changes 
their activity gave gorbachev a large but intangible victory in 
his drive to turn more power back to the people leading to the 
question at the heart of his reforms what will the people do with 
power if and when they get it 
at least one political scientist andronik migranyan wonders 
how long people will allow gorbachev to lead them against the party 
apparatus he heads 
gorbachev practically found himself two roles both luther and 
the pope migranyan wrote recently he wants to destroy the 
existing structures and at the same time personifies those 
structures for the public and certainly lack of successes which 
are due to the clumsy function of the party and state structure 
weaken his role as leader 
even politburo members warn that if the party does not improve 
its standing the soviet union may spin out of control 
an end to the communists hold on absolute power would be 
simply deadly said yegor k ligachev a multiparty system 
would mean the breakup of the soviet federation because the 
communist party is the only real political force that binds and 
unites all people of the country into a single union of republics

when the plane carrying presidential aide 
steve studdert tried to land on africas serengeti plains it first 
had to buzz the landing area to chase off a couple hundred 
wildebeests 
that accomplished he recalled none of the passengers dared 
deplane until some feasting lions polished off the dinner they had 
felled nearby 
the episode en route to an energy meeting in kenya was just one 
of many on studderts 5 millionmile odyssey searching out the 
perfect image for three presidents 
he went by air in everything from f16 fighters to blimps he 
went by sea in everything from submarines to tugboats and he went 
by land in everything from fire trucks to ambulances 
but after surveying the sights from the shipyards of poland to 
the wild creatures of the serengeti the white house advance guru 
is hanging it up at the white house to point his trusty jeep 
homeward to the sleepy town of highland utah 
studdert formally the assistant to president bush for special 
activities and initiatives said he wants to leave government for 
a more quiet life and denies reports he is planning to run for 
governor of utah 
its just time he said to spend his time on things other than 
boating down the mississippi to plan a presidential tour of flood 
devastation or riding the rails across ohio on a campaign whistle 
stop 
but he is not shy about recalling his behindthescenes role in 
shaping years of presidential level memories 
what was wonderful for me as i look at the most recent europe 
trip i realize that 45 days before the president went there i was 
there studdert said in an interview i stood in an empty 
church in leiden i stood in an empty square in gdansk in my 
minds eye i saw what i hoped could be what a wonderful feeling it 
was to go with the president and see it happen 
what happened was 25000 poles packed into the square in gdansk 
cheering an american president what happened was several hundred 
dutch sitting quietly in a church to hear an american president 
speak movingly on democratic ideals that had taken root in the 
netherlands before there was a united states of america 
to make those and hundreds of other events happen involved a 
morass of logistical details including dealing with foreign 
governments and southern country sheriffs on motorcades security 
crowd control press arrangements and other aspects 
white house chief of protocol joseph reed marvelled at how 
studdert and his team coordinate the trips that in effect entail 
moving the entire white house 
reed called him cecil b de studdert 
a former advance man for presidents ford and reagan studdert 
was tapped by presidential candidate bush last year to work on 
flagwaving imagery that would portray bush as the candidate of 
patriotism 
after the election he accompanied bush to the white house to 
come up with event scenarios speech settings props and travel 
plans that showcase the presidents policy goals he has headed up 
the logistics plans that have taken bush to 12 countries and 24 
states in his first six months in office 
given his estimate that hes traveled nearly 5 million miles 
doing white house and campaign advance work some things were bound 
to go wrong 
once he paid some teenagers 20 to use their pickup truck for a 
parade for presidential candidate gerald ford he didnt find out 
until the parade was moving around a race track that the truck 
belonged not to the youths but to a man in the stands who was 
shocked to see his vehicle roll by filled with press photographers 
we never saw the kids again studdert said 
another motorcade problem came on election night in 1980 when 
ronald reagan wanted to go to his victory celebration early because 
president carter conceded early there were no motorcade vehicles 
to be seen outside reagans house 
we stopped the first six cars coming along one of the cars 
was driven by one of the gabor sisters we just loaded up the press 
corps and said lets go 
one of studderts most harrowing days also provided his most 
poignant memory one of those small things one never forgets 
it was his first assignment during the reagan presidency 
coordinating the return of the 52 american hostages from iran whose 
return on inauguration day 1981 was negotiated under president 
carter 
at the last minute he was told to find a band for the hostages 
arrival at andrews air force base outside washington he scouted 
around and found a navy band the only requirement he told the 
leader was that his musicians be able to play tie a yellow 
ribbon 
they learned it on the bus driving to the base 
studdert wanted a marching band but this one was a concert band 
today youre a marching band he told them 
i will never forget the trombone player marching along playing 
tie a yellow ribbon with tears running down his cheeks he said

two of the airmen who dropped the atomic bomb on hiroshima in 
the worlds first nuclear attack 44 years ago sunday say they still 
have no regrets about the mission and they insist it sped up the 
end of the war with japan 
jacob beser 68 was aboard the bomber enola gay which dropped 
the bomb on hiroshima on aug 6 1944 and bocks car which bombed 
nagasaki three days later 
a popular misconception is that we reacted like my god what 
did we do said the retired engineer instead just like every 
other gi on a mission it was my god look at that go 
about 140000 people were killed in the hiroshima attack and 
70000 died at nagasaki japan surrendered unconditionally on aug 
15 1945 ending world war ii without the costly invasion the 
united states had feared it would have to mount 
what we did was right was necessary saved lives and i hope 
we never have to do it again beser said this weekend in memphis 
i have a lot of confidence in the future 
retired brig gen paul tibbetts jr who flew the enola gay 
over hiroshima and into history said that at the time he thought 
if i am successful i can bring this war to a quick end 
tibbetts 74 said he had no qualms about the mission but has 
occasionally been questioned by antinuclear groups or individuals 
i dont have to justify it with anybody he said recently 
from his home in columbus ohio 
i did what i was supposed to do exactly what i was supposed 
to do tibbetts said i carried out a very successful bombing 
mission i didnt want to be a hero 
thencol tibbetts was one of americas most experienced bomber 
pilots when he was given the topsecret hiroshima mission 
being only 29 years old when i got the assignment there 
wasnt anything that was going to stop me he said 
he and his crew of 14 took off in their b29 superfortress early 
the morning of aug 6 from tinian island in the western pacific 
1750 miles from hiroshima 
the enola gay arrived at its destination at 815 am local time 
and dropped its deadly payload from 31000 feet it exploded in a 
blinding flash 
thenlt besers job was to monitor japan for possible 
electronic interference that could cause the bombs to malfunction 
i never saw the city of hiroshima he said i just saw 
this big boiling mess and fires breaking out on the periphery 
beser who visited hiroshima in 1985 said he felt detached 
during the bombing missions 
if somebody had given me a rifle and said go out and kill 
those japanese im not sure i could have done it he said

the widow of a man who killed a stockbroker 
wounded another and killed himself after losing a fortune in the 
1987 stock market crash is battling his insurance companies in 
court for 15 million in unpaid claims 
judith kane 49 claims she is entitled to collect 1 million 
from bankers security life insurance and 500000 from prudential 
insurance co on life insurance policies taken out by her late 
husband arthur kane 
but both insurers refuse to pay because arthur kane never told 
them he was really arthur katz a disbarred lawyer in the federal 
witness protection program 
last week a threejudge panel from the atlantabased 11th us 
circuit court of appeals traveled to miami to hear arguments in the 
case which the insurers appealed after losing a round in federal 
court in miami 
bankers security thought they were insuring a mildmannered 
longtime government employee alan fine a lawyer for bankers 
security said after the hearing instead they were insuring 
someone very different 
fine said the judges acknowledged the case is unique 
there is no florida law covering this kind of situation he 
said 
but mrs kanes lawyer david pollack was upbeat about the 
outcome of the appeal 
we are confident shell win again pollack said 
a ruling was expected in six months fine said 
the appeal is the latest round in the dispute that broke out 
over kanes life insurance policies shortly after his suicide 
kane 53 reportedly lost 4 million in the oct 19 1987 
crash a week later he walked into the merrill lynch office in 
suburban miami with a 357caliber magnum pistol and shot office 
manager jose argilagos to death 
he next turned the gun on his stockbroker lloyd kolokoff and 
shot him in the back paralyzing him for life kane then killed 
himself 
the twoyear suicide exclusion clause in his insurance policies 
had expired 
the shootings put kane in the national spotlight and revealed 
he really was katz a federal informant with suspected ties to 
organized crime 
katz was a disbarred kansas city mo lawyer given a new 
identity 11 years earlier after testifying for the government in 
several cases 
while kane earned 29676 working at the social security 
administration in miami he lived in a 430000 sixbedroom home 
in miamis prosperous kendall section 
according to bankers security of virginia and prudential of new 
jersey kane negated his policies by not disclosing his real name

twentyone antiapartheid 
activists openly defied their police restrictions sunday by 
appearing at a rally where speakers called for intensifying a 
nationwide civil disobedience campaign 
on sunday an estimated 2000 people led by anglican archbishop 
desmond tutu attended an evening service at the african methodist 
episcopal church in the mixedrace township of athlone outside cape 
town 
tutu and the rev allan boesak urged the crowd to support a 
recently launched mass defiance campaign that is the most ambitious 
such effort by opposition groups in 30 years 
the 21 activists who publicly identified themselves and said 
they would not abide by their police orders have been restricted 
since their release from detention earlier this year 
the restrictions vary but most activists are required to be at 
home from dusk to dawn and are not allowed to attend meetings where 
the government is criticized 
no uniformed police were present 
the government has released almost 1000 detainees since they 
went on a hunger strike in january however about half have been 
placed under restriction orders according to human rights groups 
an estimated 30000 people almost all black have been detained 
without charge for varying lengths of time under the 3yearold 
state of emergency although only a few dozen currently are held 
the defiance campaign began wednesday when 270 blacks and 
indians sought and received treatment at whitesonly hospitals the 
mass democratic movement a loosely organized antiapartheid 
coalition that arranged the protest promised additional acts of 
defiance 
law and order minister adriaan vlok has said the campaign is a 
time bomb that could explode at any moment 
also sunday police said in a report on unrest over the past 24 
hours that six black men were killed in separate incidents near the 
southeastern city of pietermaritzburg black factional fighting in 
the region has claimed 2000 lives since 1986 
four men died when blacks set fire to a house in the mpumalanga 
township outside pietermaritzburg and two black men were shot 
fatally in separate attacks in nearby townships the report said 
a seventh black man was shot to death in kwathema east of 
johannesburg police said 
main combatants in the pietermaritzburg violence are the united 
democratic front a banned antiapartheid coalition and inkatha a 
zulu group headed by mangosuthu buthelezi 
both groups oppose the apartheid policy of race discrimination 
but the united democratic front favors confrontational tactics such 
as boycotts sanctions strikes and protests that inkatha does not 
endorse

two topoftheline soviet fighters 
accompanied by the worlds largest aircraft made a historic stop at 
elmendorf air force base on sunday en route to a sales mission 
in canada 
it was the first time that mig29 fighters and the soviet an225 
transport had landed on the north american continent 
these are showroom models said maj doug mccoy an 
elmendorf spokesman who was referring to the pair of strippeddown 
mig29s that had taxied to within 20 yards of journalists air 
force observers and about 250 spectators 
these are factory aircraft they havent been delivered to the 
soviet air force civilian test pilots are flying the migs 
the soviets were en route to the abbotsford international air 
show in vancouver british columbia 
there the fighters and the giant transport will be displayed 
and demonstrated as part of the soviet militarys latest and 
greatest 
after a fourhour refueling stop in alaska they were to be 
escorted to the canadian border by us air force f15 eagles they 
were to be met by canadian forces cf18s hornet jet fighters 
this is the first time since 1945 that soviet fighter aircraft 
have flown through alaska airspace said lt gen thomas 
mcinerney commander of the alaskan air command it hasnt been 
since lendlease when some 8000 planes left us factories being 
flown directly to the soviet eastern front that weve marked such 
an occurrence 
today we are hosting the soviet military aircraft en route to 
a much friendlier event 
capt richard armstrong one of the f15 eagle fighter pilots 
who escorted the migs through us airspace said it was thrilling 
to be the first american pilot to get so close to the soviet 
frontline fighter 
id like to say it was another day at the office but id be 
ying armstrong said its a pretty airplane i felt a little 
like you do when you have guests in your house you want to make 
them feel comfortable but you give them some help 
the soviets took time to participate in a news conference sunday 
primarily to express thanks for the welcome they had been shown 
they were hosted for lunch at the elmendorf officers club and 
invited to shop at the base exchange 
we were met by excellent aircraft and excellent pilots said 
anotoly kvochur a mikoyan test bureau pilot who does the 
demonstration flights of the mig29s at air shows i hope our 
relations will be just as they are and will improve 
kvochur was forced to eject from a mig29 two months ago at the 
paris air show when the aircraft sucked a bird into a jet intake 
during a lowaltitude pass 
the green gray and black mig29s are twinengine fighters 
comparable in size to the navys fa18 hornet 
the transport has six turbofan engines and plays a major role in 
the soviet space program in which it shuttles the buran space 
shuttle orbiter and sections of rocket launch vehicles 
it was unknown to the west until a prototype was unveiled last 
year fewer than 10 are likely to be manufactured air force

the proiranian captors of american 
hostage joseph cicippio said sunday they would free him immediately 
if israel releases an abducted shiite moslem cleric and 150 
lebanese and 300 palestinian prisoners 
the group revolutionary justice organization also demanded 
that israel allow all 55 palestinians deported during the uprising 
against israeli rule of the occupied territories to return home 
also sunday a leader of the proiranian hezbollah said an 
israeli soldier it holds could be killed unless israel frees the 
cleric the hezbollah leader hussein mousawi also admitted for 
the first time that the party wields influence over the kidnappers 
of foreign hostages 
israeli officials refused comment on both the revolutionary 
justice and mousawi statements earlier they said the cleric 
sheik abdul karim obeid would only be freed if two israeli 
soldiers and an air force navigator held in south lebanon were 
freed 
in washington bill harlow a white house spokesman said we 
wouldnt comment on it in any way we try not to react to each 
individual rumor or report its a very fluid situation and that 
doesnt do any good 
secretary of state james a baker iii in mexico city for a 
conference of us and mexican cabinet members was asked about the 
demands for cicipios release and he said our wellestablished 
policy is not to negotiate with terrorists 
if the united states were to get into that game wed simply 
see a lot more americans taken hostage around the world 
he reaffirmed the us policy of neither concurring in nor 
objecting to the israeli position of offering to negotiate with 
hostagetakers for the release of captives in lebanon 
the proposal by the revolutionary justice organization made no 
mention of freedom for any of the other 15 foreigners held in 
lebanon 
it was contained in a handwritten statement written in arabic 
and delivered to the independent beirut newspaper annahar an 
instant photograph of american hostage edward tracy whom the group 
also holds was sent along with it 
it was the first time revolutionary justice has said it would 
free cicippio 58 a hostage since sept 12 1986 
the statement cited the flexible stances declared by the 
parties concerned and the encouraging regional developments that 
herald happy endings to the hostage problem for making the 
exchange offer 
the group threatened last week to kill cicippio if israel did 
not free obeid who is affiliated with hezbollah and was abducted 
by israeli commandos july 28 israel accused obeid of instigating 
attacks on the jewish state 
less than an hour before the deadline set for cicippios death 
revolutionary justice said it was freezing the execution order 
and substituting it with an initiative calling for obeids 
release and freedom for palestinian and lebanese guerrillas held by 
israel 
sundays statement said the new demands represented the 
practical stages of the initiative and added its success 
could be an adequate introduction to curb the dramatic developments 
of the hostages issue 
in norristown pa one of cicippios brothers thomas cicippio 
said he was not happy with the offer because it did not mention 
freedom for the other foreigners held in lebanon 
meanwhile in the lebanese town of baalbek mousawi met with 
foreign reporters and was asked what would happen if obeid were not 
freed 
if we find out that the interests of islam and moslems and the 
interests of the oppressed dictates that one of the israeli 
soldiers be killed so will it be he responded 
he also said that if the united states is able to help itself 
and help its hostages by stopping its support for israel and by not 
participating in anything that hurts moslems in lebanon this 
could encourage hezbollah to think of a way to help resolve the 
hostage issue 
mousawi said some members of proiranian organizations holding 
hostages are known to us and we hold consultations with them 
from time to time 
it was the first time hezbollah has publicly acknowledged it has 
contacts with groups holding hostages 
it has denied having anything to do with the abductions but is 
generally believed to be the umbrella for shiite moslem extremists 
holding most of the captives 
mousawi also lauded the reported slaying of us marine lt col 
william r higgins saying bravo for the oppressed on earth 
because challenging the islamic nation should not continue but 
he also said he could not confirm higgins was dead 
the proiranian organization for the oppressed on earth claimed 
on july 31 that it had hanged higgins because of israels refusal 
to free obeid higgins body has not been found 
there are 16 foreigners held hostage in lebanon including eight 
americans the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 
16 1985 
cicippio was acting comptroller at the american university in 
beirut when he was abducted tracy is a writer his date of 
abduction is unclear but revolutionary justice claimed oct 21 
1986 that it had abducted him 
the photograph with the statement sunday showed tracy from the 
waist up he wore a brown tshirt had a bushy white beard and was 
smiling broadly as he looked into the camera 
elsewhere sunday un mediator marrack goulding said families 
of hostages in lebanon should not lose hope and said there is a 
kind of subdued optimism about prospects for arranging a 
hostage swap 
he met syrian foreign minister farouk el sharaa as part of his 
effort to break the stalemate in the hostage crisis and to 
determine higgins fate

assistant secretary of state herman cohen 
on sunday began a visit to sudan that will determine whether the 
united states will give aid to the new military government 
cohen the senior state department official for african affairs 
told reporters his talks with lt gen omar hassan elbashir and 
other sudanese officials will cover the new governments plans for 
ending a 6yearold civil war and rebuilding the economy 
western sources said cohen also will study elbashirs position 
on allowing delivery of relief supplies to southerners suffering 
from a warinduced famine both sides in the past have used food as 
a weapon in the southern war 
cohen said the two days of talks will help the us government 
determine whether it should invoke a law that would freeze 108 
million in aid because of the militarys ouster of an elected 
government 
a 15man junta overthrew prime minister sadek elmahdis 
government on june 30 the coup made the country subject to a us 
law that stipulates aid must be halted to a country where a 
democratically elected government is removed in violation of the 
nations constitution 
fiji was the first country to fall under the law in 1986 and 
aid was halted sudan is the second 
western sources say 22 million in development and economic aid 
to sudan has been frozen since january because the country has not 
paid dues on us government loans for more than a year 
the bush administration meanwhile has made it clear that it will 
continue humanitarian aid to sudan which amounted to 100 million 
in the past year 
sudan is one of the worlds poorest nations and its economy has 
been destroyed by the 1 millionaday war in the south where 
minority christians and animists are fighting for more autonomy 
from the dominant moslems of the north 
cohen opened his african tour in cairo last week and flew to 
khartoum from addis ababa ethiopia

secretary of state james a baker iii 
expressed hope sunday that a new era in usmexican relations is 
at hand after years of crossborder acrimony 
baker and four other members of the us cabinet came to mexico 
city for talks with mexican officials 
baker told reporters accompanying him that relations with mexico 
were once in the category of managing irritants and his goal is 
to create common opportunities between the two countries 
i dont think the unites states has a relationship that is any 
more important than the relations with mexico he said 
he arrived here in late afternoon the other cabinet members 
came to mexico in another plane 
officials in mexico city saw the presence of such a highlevel 
delegation as a reflection of the significance the bush 
administration attaches to laying the groundwork for a more 
productive relationship with mexico 
about eight hours of talks are planned monday on an array of 
issues but the dominant subjects are expected to be drug 
enforcement and mexicos economic prospects following a debt 
reduction agreement reached two weeks ago 
the meetings are being held under the auspices of the 
usmexico binational commission and a state department list 
shows 41 participants from nine agencies in the us delegation 
the commission was established eight years ago and serves as a 
forum for regular meetings of cabinet officials from both countries 
besides baker other us officials include attorney general 
dick thornburgh treasury secretary nicholas brady commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher environmental protection agency 
administrator william reilly us trade reprssentative carla hills 
and the director of the us information agency bruce gelb 
presidents bush and carlos salinas de gortari are both relative 
newcomers to their respective posts and the change in 
administration in both countries seems to have contributed to an 
improvement in relations 
under president reagan relations were dominated by mutual 
recriminations over differing views on the conflict in central 
america an issue that has faded in recent months 
american officials also have praised salinas for his handling of 
mexicos economic policies and evidence that he is serious about 
grappling with crossborder drug smuggling 
living standards in mexico have dropped precipitously over the 
years partly because of the countrys repayment obligations on its 
100 billion foreign debt 
but on july 23 an agreement was reached between the mexican 
goverment and the commercial banks to which mexico owes most of its 
debt the agreement is expected to give mexico some financial 
breathing room by reducing annual debt payments of 10 billion to 
12 billion by more than 2 billion 
the agenda for mondays talks includes financial cooperation 
narcotics immigration law enforcement the environment border 
cooperation and fisheries trade and investment and cultural 
relations 
baker flew to mexico city from houston sunday afternoon he was 
to have dinner with mexican foreign secretary fernando solana a 
luncheon with salinas is scheduled for monday

thirtyeight rockets pounded kabul 
sunday as soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze arrived in 
the capital for talks with government officials nine people were 
reported killed 
thirtyfive people were injured mainly in residential areas 
the bakhtar news agency said four hospitals reported at least 52 
injured 
guerrillas in the mountains ringing this city of 225 million 
people started firing in the early morning four hours before 
shevardnadze arrived from moscow 
it was one of the most intense barrages since the last soviet 
troops left afghanistan on feb 15 leaving the government alone to 
fight usbacked moslem guerrillas 
on july 10 kabul was hit by 65 rockets that killed more than 30 
people 
shevardnadze was expected to report to the afghan government on 
recent talks with secretary of state james a baker iii un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and iranian president 
hashemi rafsanjani on efforts to negotiate a political settlement 
to afghanistans 10yearold civil war 
the soviet minister held two meetings with president najib 
bakhtar reported 
tass the official soviet news agency reported that najib and 
shevardnadze discussed prospects of a political solution to the 
conflict it said the foreign minister also reaffirmed soviet 
economic and political support for afghanistan 
no further details on the talks were available 
it was impossible for shevardnadze to miss the almost continuous 
explosions during the afternoon the familiar boom of rockets sent 
some afghans rushing indoors though others remained on the 
streets shopping selling food and trying to catch buses 
no group claimed responsibility for sundays attack but the 
guerrillas have claimed responsibility for previous rocket attacks 
the guerrillas say they aim at military targets and accuse the 
government of rocketing civilian targets a charge the government 
denies 
on sunday morning several rockets struck the capitals 
southwestern darulaman area where the ministry of defense is 
located 
more than 20 rockets exploded within a mile of the continental 
hotel in northwest kabul on sunday afternoon one landed in the 
garden several struck a nearby hill demolishing a house 
a few landed near the british high commission which was 
evacuated before the soviet withdrawal 
at least two struck near the main kabul grain silo where more 
than 100 trucks were waiting to unload wheat 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani has accused 
guerrillas of trying to destroy the silo which contains 20000 
tons of grain to starve the population 
kabul has been hit by almost daily rocket barrages since late 
june un sources said 68 rockets hit the city in the last week 
not counting sunday 
between june 25 and aug 1 the sources said 281 residents were 
killed and 745 injured in rocket attacks and a car bombing 
amani said published reports that an attempted coup has been 
foiled and a number of generals arrested are baseless and have no 
grounds 
he accused the united states and pakistan which help arm the 
guerrillas of fabricating the rumors to intensify what he called 
its psychological warfare against the afghan government 
the western campaign is aimed at whitewashing the guerrillas 
military failures and discord among its factions amani said 
except for the blind rocketing which is hitting the city 
there is nothing they can point to and be proud of he said

a commission formed by the mississippi 
legislature spied on members of a black political party during the 
1960s in an effort to keep them out of office according to a 
former governors personal papers 
the 1956 legislature formed the sovereignty commission to act as 
the states watchdog to preserve segregation it was abolished in 
1973 when thengov bill waller vetoed its funding 
the mississippi freedom democratic party operated from 1964 
until 1968 to provide alternative black candidates to the regular 
party of the whitecontrolled state government 
the spies compiled rosters of the partys supporters obtained 
records of its meetings and wrote elaborate reports about its 
candidates strategies according to commission documents contained 
in the papers of former gov paul b johnson jr 
by nov 2 1966 the commission had a list of 31 civil rights 
supporters and the groups to which they belonged including the 
freedom democratic party according to papers of johnson who was 
governor from 1964 to 1968 
the documents in johnsons papers came to light for the first 
time after they were made available to the clarionledger in 
jackson in a july 28 agreement with the attorney general the 
johnson papers are at a library at the university of southern 
mississippi in hattiesburg the newspaper has not said how it 
reached the agreement with the attorney general 
to have been treated as a political threat i feel 
complimented lawrence guyot one of the 31 named said in an 
interview from his washington home last week the sovereignty 
commission was concerned about destroying things they wanted to 
maintain the fear they could only maintain their fear by 
depriving people of the vote 
we knew the meetings were being taped and people were acting 
as human tapes guyot said 
educators and historians say the commissions files could lead 
to the rewriting of state history books 
for one more people have claimed they fought for civil rights 
than actually did said leslie mclemore dean of jackson state 
universitys graduate school of political science 
as more commission documents come to light you get a fairly 
true picture of the participation mclemore said on the other 
hand you get people who were on the other side trying to tone 
down their conservative nature 
charles sallis a history professor at millsaps college in 
jackson said he expects the files will show the kind of fascist 
tactics whites were willing to use to preserve segregation

unions representing 157000 workers went on 
strike against three regional telephone companies sunday slowing 
local phone service in 15 states and the district of columbia 
nine southeastern states were spared telephone strikes as the 
communications workers of america and bellsouth reached a tentative 
agreement on a new threeyear contract late saturday 
but technicians operators clerical personnel sales and 
factory workers at nynex corp bell atlantic corp and pacific 
telesis began strikes sunday after talks failed 
no talks were scheduled with nynex or bell atlantic which 
together provide telephone service to the northeast and 
midatlantic regions 
informal talks were held sunday in california between pacific 
telesis cwa and the international brotherhood of electrical 
workers but no progress was reported 
we are talking but we seem to be making very slow progress 
said cwa spokeswoman vira milirides 
no formal talks in any of the strikes were scheduled for monday 
but informal bargaining was expected to continue with resumption 
of fomal negotiations hinging on those discussions 
people who dial direct should find little interruption in 
service in the strike areas company and union officials said 
but consumers needing operator or directory assistance often 
were greeted sunday with recordings saying heavy call volume had 
slowed service and that situation would worsen with the start of 
the workweek monday 
installations and repairs also would be slowed if the strikes 
drag on and the companies try to operate with management personnel 
in place of strikers 
in all three strike situations the unions and companies 
remained well apart on the issues of wages and health insurance 
and a number of local issues remained unresolved in each set of 
negotiations as well the debate over health insurance has been the 
major obstacle with the unions resisting companies efforts to 
shift some costs to workers 
the greatest differences appear to be between the unions and 
nynex that strike was called well before the midnight saturday 
deadline because the differences were so great no formal talks were 
held saturday 
cwa represents 40000 nynex workers and ibew an additional 
20000 the company based in new york provides local phone 
service in new york and the six new england states and went through 
a nineday strike three years ago 
we were prepared for this and got our management teams out 
there at midnight said nynex spokesman john bonomo but 
things may start to back up as we get the crunch on monday 
at pacific telesis the strike was called at midnight california 
time 3 am edt but negotiations continued through much of the 
night the talks recessed sunday morning but were expected to 
resume although company officials said nothing was scheduled 
officially the company serves parts of california and all of 
nevada and employs 44500 union workers all but 2500 of them cwa 
members 
the strike deadline at bell atlantic was extended as 
negotiations continued past midnight saturday but a walkout was 
called just before 7 am sunday because of a lack of progress 
edward g grogan bell atlantics vice president of labor 
relations expressed disappointment the union had rejected a 
progressive settlement with a significant compensation package 
improved health care services and a long list of family care and 
employment security provisions 
but the cwas bill bickers said the companys offer of 
retrogressive wages and benefits is a slap in the face to all of 
our members 
bell atlantic serves delaware maryland new jersey 
pennsylvania virginia west virginia and the nations capital cwa 
represents 41000 bell atlantic workers ibew 11500 
the bellsouth agreement provides an immediate 4 percent pay 
increase and cost of living adjustments in 1990 and 1991 bellsouth 
officials said sunday the pact also provides for employees to 
receive up to 12 months of child care leave and receive six months 
of medical coverage while on leave 
three more of the socalled baby bells spawned by the 1984 
breakup of american telephone amp telegraph face strike deadlines at 
the end of the week

more infants of low birth weight are dying from 
infections than ever before but the death rate among such babies 
has dropped sharply according to a federal researchers study 
a separate study conducted in alabama concluded that 
lowbirthweight babies living in rural sections of the state are 
at greater risk of dying early than similar babies in cities 
the number of lowbirthweight babies in the united states 
those born weighing 5 pounds or less and often premature dropped 
from 286528 to 248104 from 1969 to 1982 a 13 percent drop said 
the study by dr janine jason of the us centers for disease 
control in atlanta 
among whites the mortality rate for such infants fell from 130 
per 1000 to 73 per 1000 from 1969 to 1982 the latest year for 
which figures are available for blacks the rate fell from 122 per 
1000 to 72 
the study which examined 25000 deaths recorded during the 
period did not cite an overall death rate 
infectious diseases which were associated with 4 percent of the 
deaths in 1969 accounted for 10 percent by 1982 the study said 
one reason is that lowbirthweight babies are surviving long 
enough to contract infectious diseases jason said she said some 
parents may not understand the seriousness of an infectious disease 
or have the money or transportation to bring the child to the 
hospital 
this is especially worrisome because infectious diseases are a 
potentially preventable cause of death jason wrote in the study 
published in the august edition of pediatrics the journal of the 
american academy of pediatrics based in suburban elk grove village 
most of the babies die of respiratory failure or other physical 
problems that occur because of inadequate physical development 
according to the study 
in the alabama study which was also published in pediatrics 
researchers said they suspect living conditions and lack of access 
to hospitals are responsible for the greater risk to 
lowbirthweight babies living in rural areas 
the study conducted between 1980 and 1983 found 15969 
lowweightbirths during the period with 131 deaths per 1000 
births the rate in racial terms was 1082 deaths per 1000 for 
whites and 1584 deaths per 1000 for blacks 
overall the death rate of rural low birth rate babies was 14 
per 1000 compared to 129 per 1000 for urban babies 
the 40 percent of alabamas population that live in rural areas 
especially blacks have housing that is substantially worse than 
that in some third world countries said dr christiane hale of 
the university of alabama 
hale and another researcher found that many parts of rural 
alabama have no indoor plumbing or running water 
if theres no refrigerator theres no way to keep formula 
chilled which leads to infection hale said

the head of the financial section of cubas 
interior ministry killed himself because of dejection and shame 
over a drug scandal involving the ministry a mexican news agency 
said sunday 
but the report in notimex the official mexican agency did not 
say how or when col rafael alvarez cueto committed suicide 
it attributed its dispatch to a report published sunday in 
havana in the cuban newspaper rebel youth 
the report said alvarez cueto left two letters expressing 
confidence in the revolution and in president fidel castro and 
dejection and shame at the drug scandal that sent four high 
officials to the firing squad and 10 to prison 
they were convicted of helping smuggle tons of drugs into the 
united states in collusion with colombias medellin cocaine cartel 
two of those executed by firing squads on july 13 were interior 
ministry officials the two others shot were army officers 
including a highly decorated general who had commanded cuban troops 
serving in angola to help that countrys marxist government battle 
rebels 
the article in rebel youth indicated that alvarez cueto had not 
been implicated in the scandal it said alvarez cueto was allowed 
to keep his job while interior minister jose abrantes fernandez and 
other ministry officials were removed from their posts 
abrantes fernandez was not among the 14 people courtmartialed 
in the drug scandal but apparently was removed because of the 
corruption that occurred in his ministry 
the military court was told that the army and ministry officials 
involved in the drug scandal put official resources at the disposal 
of drug traffickers who moved tons of colombian cocaine and 
jamaican marijuana through the caribbean into the united states 
castros communist government has called the scandal the 
biggest since castro took power in 1959 a betrayal of the ideals 
of the cuban revolution and a cancer that will be excised from 
cuban society

supreme court justice anthony kennedy criticized 
the assault by neglect on the federal judiciary in the wake of 
congress rejection of pay hikes for federal judges 
although kennedy did not specifically mention the rejection last 
march of the 50 percent pay hike he told the american bar 
association convention on saturday that federal judges had suffered 
a devestating blow 
this is assault by neglect and i am confident that if this 
situation remains unremedied the integrity the independence and 
the traditions of the american judiciary will be compromised in a 
way that is not likely to be undone kennedy said 
the federal judiciary cannot retain its integrity and its 
independence and its strength unless it can draw on the highest 
ranks of the practicing legal profession to serve as judges on this 
bench at the height of their careers he said 
he said the supreme court was not included in his assessment 
because we are in a special situation 
us district court judges earn 89500 annually while federal 
appeals court judges earn 95000 a year those on the supreme 
court earn 110000 annually with the chief justice earning an 
extra 5000 
the rejected pay raise was part of a package that included 
salary hikes for congress and administration officials 
kennedy made his remarks during an aba panel discussion on 
alternative ways to resolve disputes also on the panel were 
supreme court justice byron white and hawaii supreme court chief 
justice herman lum 
white said the backlog of court cases makes it imperative to 
find other ways of resolving disputes 
in federal courts alone about 269000 cases or about 470 for 
each of the 575 district court judges were filed in the year 
ending june 30 1988 he said 
one alternative in civil cases is the use of summary jury 
trials in which a sixmember jury returns a nonbinding advisory 
verdict to help each side evaluate its case and encourage a 
settlement white said 
in hawaii in the past three years 2000 personal injury cases 
have been resolved through mandatory nonbinding arbitration lum 
said 
the judiciarys center for alternative dispute resolution has 
helped settle or streamline almost 50 complicated multiparty 
cases he said

zuazo and paz zamora from taking office in 1982 the military 
stepped down

that he assumed the sons identity after the boy was killed while 
trying to escape a babyselling ring 
in an interview published sunday in the buffalo news david 
bonnabel 25 admitted his story was a stretch of the truth 
but said he was only trying to bring to justice a babyselling ring 
that killed young girls and his closest friend 
associates and law enforcement officials said bonnabel who 
claimed he was abducted as a child and held captive for more than 
10 years in the louisiana bayou is nothing more than a talented 
con man who has fled the country 
the whole thing had a purpose bonnabel said during a 
telephone phone interview from a latin american city but 
everything got out of hand

national who used them as part of an elaborate scheme to prove he 
was an american 
and they still wonder what happened to their son jonathan who 
was three when he disappeared from a florida beach 21 years ago 
originally bonnabel claimed he was kidnapped at age 3 and kept 
captive in a trailer in louisiana now he says he is a native of 
guadalajara mexico of french descent who entered the us 
illegally as a teenage dropout 
he says he was confined against his will in louisiana in 1981 
at which time he met a 15yearold boy named jonathan whom his 
captor claimed was her son bonnabel says he soon realized jonathan 
had been kidnapped by the woman and was being sexually and 
physically abused and kept out of school 
after several months in the louisiana trailer bonnabel claims 
he realized that the woman was a midwife who delivered the babies 
of pregnant girls and sold them on the black market he also claims 
he and jonathan witnessed the murder of one girl 
eventually he said after jonathan was killed in an escape 
attempt he claimed jonathans identity as his own 
bonnabel now claims that while conducting an extensive search 
for his own parents he realized that telling a white lie 
substituting himself for jonathan would attract more attention 
then the publicity got out of hand he said but i played 
along from that moment on it was the only resource i had to get 
help 
the haganses flew bonnabel to florida for a reunion before 
realizing he wasnt their son 
mrs hagans said she believes bonnabel was involved in 
something bad whether or not my jonathan was involved i do not 
know now she said i hope he bonnabel doesnt come back 
carol boyette a relative of the hagans family and an activist 
in missingpersons causes said bonnabel finally recanted his story 
because of overwhelming evidence and the threat of a blood test

toyotas new lexus ls 400 luxury sedan may cause 
people to think twice about buying more expensive european cars 
even mercedesbenz and bmw models an industry analyst says 
there is a certain cachet to something made in the black 
forest but how much more is one willing to pay for that cachet 
maybe there are fewer people willing to pay more said mary ann 
sudol an analyst for fitch investor service in new york 
reporters got a look at the lexus cars friday at a racetrack in 
california they are scheduled for introduction in dealer showrooms 
sept 1 
the first 1000 vehicles were shipped to dealers wednesday said 
dave illingworth lexus vice president and general manager 
the ls 400 will have a base price of 35000 illingworth said 
most american luxury cars fall in the 20000 to 30000 range 
while many european luxury cars cost more than 40000 
our game plan is to be right between the two he said 
the lexus ls 400 is toyotas first v8 fourdoor luxury sedan 
the car has 250 horsepower and a top speed of 150 mph 
with options such as leather seats compactdisc changers and

a federal indictment alleges that executives of a 
troubled savings and loan used customers funds to provide 
prostitutes hunting trips and other perks to a former texas 
savings and loan commissioner while he supervised the dallas thrift 
the 37count indictment also alleges that patrick g king 
former president of vernon savings association illegally used the 
thrifts money to to make 55000 worth of political contributions 
to several congressmen including former house speaker jim wright 
dtexas and us rep jack kemp rnew york 
king is scheduled to be tried monday on federal charges of 
conspiracy misapplication of funds and making false entries on 
vernons books in connection with the use of thrift money he has 
pleaded innocent 
king was the states deputy thrift commissioner before he joined 
vernon 
prosecution documents filed thursday detail the alleged use of 
vernon funds to provide female escorts lavish trips and other 
entertainment for former thrift commissioner l linton bowman iii 
vernon savings owner don r dixon king and other vernon officials 
the dallas morning news reported 
but kings attorney emmett colvin of dallas filed motions 
contending prostitutionhiring charges may have been improperly 
handled because bowman was impotent at the time of the alleged 
incidents 
king was employed by the savings and loan commission under 
bowmans supervision eventually becoming deputy commissioner 
before joining vernon in 1983 
bowman was appointed state savings and loan commissioner in 
1983 presiding over the texas thrift industry until november 1987 
when he resigned vernon savings was closed by federal regulators 
that month with losses totaling more than 13 billion 
prosecutors allege that shortly after king was hired at vernon 
he set up several excursions that included paid female 
companionship for his former boss at dixons request 
the alleged excursions reportedly continued from january 1985 to 
january 1986 while state regulators under bowmans supervision 
and federal thrift examiners became increasingly critical of 
speculative lending insider dealings and other questionable 
practices at vernon 
a defense motion filed thursday suggests that government 
prosecutors may have misled the federal grand jury that indicted 
king by failing to tell them that bowman was impotent at the time 
the women were hired 
us justice department prosecutors robert e hauberg jr and 
stephen p learned acknowledged in a letter july 24 that they knew 
about bowmans impotence but did not reveal it to the grand jury 
but prosecutors contended in the letter to kings lawyer that 
bowmans condition was kept confidential at his attorneys request 
and is not an issue in kings case 
whether or not mr bowman had the capacity the desire or 
the charm needed to engage in sex given the opportunity to share 
paid female companionship is irrelevant to a misappropriation of 
bank funds the prosecutors letter says 
bowman could not be reached for comment a secretary at his 
austin consulting office told the newspaper he was traveling and 
could not be reached repeated telephone calls to his home and 
office were not returned friday
