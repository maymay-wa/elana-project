new york gov mario cuomo is being courted 
by candidates and pursued by the press as curiosity mounts over 
whether he will endorse anyone before his states important april 
19 presidential primary 
cuomos closest advisers insisted wednesday that they didnt 
know when or even whether the inscrutable governor would give his 
blessing to one of the democrats competing for the partys 
nomination 
theyve made it clear both publicly and privately they want 
his endorsement cuomo press secretary gary fryer said of the 
candidates but at this point nothing has changed despite the 
4000 phone calls we got 
he gets a constant stream of calls from the various 
candidates said cuomo political adviser meyer frucher 
obviously the frontrunners have always wanted him to endorse 
and the others try to keep him from endorsing 
cuomo said in an interview published in thursdays editions of 
the washington post that he has not ruled out endorsing someone 
but added the closer you get to primary day the less reason 
there is to do so 
the newspaper quoted the new york governor as saying he 
preferred to remain neutral until after the final primaries and 
then back the leader 
thats the time for leadership in this process he told the 
post 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis fresh from twin victories 
this week in colorado and wisconsin is seeking to solidify his 
frontrunner status and clear his path to the nomination with 
another win over jesse jackson in new york 
tennessee sen albert gore jr for his part is making a major 
effort in new york to succeed outside his native south he has not 
won a contest in a month and is no longer eligible for federal 
matching funds 
there are two reasons candidates are eager for cuomos 
endorsement 
first the governor supported walter mondale in the 1984 
election and with the cuomo team running his new york campaign 
mondale scored a major victory 
second and perhaps even more important to this years 
candidates a cuomo endorsement would reduce speculation that the 
new york governor is angling for the nomination himself from a 
deadlocked national convention and that he might be an available 
alternative for democrats 
dukakis set off a new round of speculation tuesday when asked 
about a possible cuomo endorsement he chuckled and told reporters 
in boston that he planned to talk to you tomorrow 
but on wednesday dukakis said he had nothing new to report 
id like to have it cuomos endorsement he knows that but 
its his decision to make dukakis said 
this is getting to be kind of fun fryer said of the 
interest over what cuomo will do yesterday we were inundated 
with a wave of early morning hes going to go with the duke 
calls all out of boston then a little bit later in the day 
there was a wave of hes going with gore calls out of 
washington 
cuomo aides and advisers said the candidates were treating cuomo 
carefully perhaps even warily in seeking his backing 
theyre not pressuring the governor in any sense of the 
word insisted andrew cuomo the governors son and chief 
political adviser 
this is one guy that is not susceptible to pressure fryer 
added if anything pressure with cuomo is counterproductive 
cuomo and the candidates are all expected to appear separately 
thursday at a new york city meeting of about 300 members of the 
state democratic committee the candidates will be making 
individual pitches to the democratic officials and cuomo could use 
the opportunity to make a dramatic endorsement 
while the governors political advisers said they doubted that 
would happen they said they did expect him to again stress that he 
does not intend to become a candidate and that there should not be 
a convention draft 
thus far cuomo has refused to completely rule out accepting a 
convention draft although hes said it wont happen and shouldnt 
happen he has maintained that should be enough of a disclaimer to 
satisfy everyone 
hell reinforce that people should not wait for him to 
endorse said andrew cuomo of his fathers expected advice to 
fellow new york democrats hell say again what hes said before 
im not interested in running myself

the national academy of motion picture arts amp 
sciences 60th awards might well be termed the year of the actress 
so impressive are the candidates for best performance by an actress 
in 1987 
after being overshadowed for a few decades by macho stars film 
actresses are now having powerful roles fashioned for them this 
years nominees afford proof cher the perplexed widow of 
moonstruck glenn close the vengeful spurned lover in fatal 
attraction holly hunter the dynamic news producer of 
broadcast news sally kirkland the faded czech actress 
anna and meryl streep the downandout exsinger in 
ironweed 
adding to their impressive number are performances that many 
felt warranted academy consideration lillian gish and bette davis 
the whales of august sarah miles hope and glory maggie 
smith the lonely passion of judith hearn christine lahti 
housekeeping faye dunaway barfly barbra streisand 
nuts joanne woodward the glass menagerie 
cher has been drawing the most attention among the nominees 
attracting a media broadside of amazing proportions the onetime 
member of the sonny and cher singing team is justifiably proud of 
her performance in moonstruck and has been willing to talk 
about it 
moonstruck is the first movie of mine that i ever watched 
without wanting to throw up she says i was in love with the 
story its my best work since mask 
usually everyones first choice is meryl streep and then 
soandso and then soandso its something to start being 
someones first choice jack nicholson has clout you know 
barbra streisand has clout jane fonda has clout i think relative 
to them im a newcomer im not working my way toward power 
im working my way toward the best roles i can get 
equally voluble is sally kirkland who won the golden globe as 
best dramatic actress for anna she has been enjoying her 
success after years of trying i have tested for the leading role 
in 25 movies and each time the choice has narrowed to another 
actress and myself each time the other actress won 
the actress campaigned for the role in the lowbudget film 
studying the czech accent and absorbing the atmosphere of the 
emigre community in new york she even added 15 pounds and taped 
her face to create wrinkles 
does she want the oscar 
i cannot tell a lie my fantasy ever since i was 5 years old 
has been to hold that statue and say thankyou thankyou 
thankyou 
holly hunter hailed as a bright new star because of broadcast 
news has been as silent as kirkland and cher have been vocal 
she declined most interviews arguing that she was too involved 
with the sam shepard play a lie of the mind at los angeles 
mark taper theater 
director james brooks predicts the georgiaborn actress will 
be around for decades of his script she commented i loved it 
i thought it was remarkably threedimensional 
she also talked about the differences between herself and the 
news producer she portrays holly hunter is certainly less driven 
than jane craig i think that my priorities are quite a bit 
different in that im probably retty obsessed myself but not to 
such a manic degree 
after three supportingactress nominations in six film roles 
glenn close broke through in the starring category with fatal 
attraction she terms the demonic alix the first woman shes 
played who is out of control who emotionally runs the gamut 
the first real fullblooded role ive had 
her comment on the huge reaction to fatal attraction the 
whole malefemale thing in this country is very volatile right now 
i think many women are feeling used by men they invest a lot in a 
relationship in nurturing a man emotionally and in his career but 
they have their own careers and emotions and they dont get that 
nurturing in return 
after playing a number of glamorous roles twotime oscar winner 
meryl streep found her role as the derelict in ironweed had its 
advantages in this world of purgatory of the soul there are 
very few markers to go by i liked that about her i liked not 
having to worry about how i looked and being able to strip away 
strip away everying except what counts 
streep has created a series of indelible performances including 
oscar winners in kramer vs kramer and sophies choice as 
well as the deer hunter and out of africa 
she remains ambitious theres so much id like to do when 
the public is used to you in heavy drama its hard to make them 
take you seriously but i want to play comedy 
i cant stand it that stage fright inhibits me at some point 
im going to face up and do a play but for now i just go day to 
day

frank sinatra called himself and sammy davis jr 
the springsteen and michael jackson of the geritol set 
wednesday night as they launched into a guys and dolls medley 
the encore in their rat pack show 
radio city music hall wasnt exactly rocking but it was 
swinging 
the 6000seat hall was sold out with a top ticket price of 75 
lets not overdo it sinatra cautioned as davis making use 
of a new hip replacement did a few dance steps during the encore 
because im tired of working alone 
dean martin had embarked with his old las vegas buddies on the 
socalled rat pack tour earlier this year but has been sidelined in 
recent weeks by kidney problems 
we check with him every day davis assured the crowd he 
is cooking hell be back to work soon 
davis as thin as sinatra used to be did the first 40 minutes 
of the twohour show he really sang jazz and sometimes seemed to 
be trying to pull the 37piece bands ponderous arrangements up to 
his swinging tempo 
he had listeners fingers snapping to satin doll inserted 
little jokes into the lyrics of the lady is a tramp put 
powerful emotion into what kind of fool am i and birth of 
the blues and made mr bojangles into a oneact play he was 
never slick 
sinatras voice sometimes has a frayed edge but his masterful 
phrasing and timing of pithy asides are intact more important his 
vocal timbre the thing that makes one know its sinatra and not 
vic damone or somebody else is still there 
he sang the soliloquy from carousel and the audience 
exploded in applause in it he did some of his best singing of the 
evening the audience also seemed to appreciate his ambition in 
choosing this highquality lengthy musical passage 
even better moments were sinatras hardswinging mack the 
knife and new york new york and the alltime saloon song 
one more for the road which he has sung many times but this 
time also acted 
when sinatra and davis harmonized beautifully on the final lines 
of the oldest established permanent floating crap game in new 
york you knew youd been thoroughly entertained 
on their final night in town sunday the geritol boys will be 
joined by peggy lee in a benefit for cancer research

daily doses of the drug ritalin are increasingly 
the treatment of choice for children diagnosed with attention 
deficit disorder not surprisingly more and more clinics are 
specializing in such diagnosis and treatment and schools are often 
enthusiastic about ritalins success two stories offer inside 
looks at one such clinic where an 11yearold girl learned she 
would begin what might be years of ritalin therapy and at a school 
where teachers credit ritalin with helping children conquer their 
emotional and academic despair a third story looks at utah the 
state with the youngest population a reputation for moral 
conservatism and the highest per capita use of ritalin in the 
nation 
</TEXT>

her school principal had urged her mother to make 
the fourhour drive from rural northern michigan now 11yearold 
chrissie sat in a tiny windowless office where a psychologist 
peppered her with questions 
the morning would end with doctors at the attention deficit 
disorder clinic of childrens hospital telling chrissie her 
baffling problems at home and in school would mean treatment with 
the stimulant ritalin quite likely for years 
but first doctors tested chrissie spelling tests math tests 
reading tests questions about her family life they probed her 
moods whether she ever felt like committing suicide once or 
twice she said they examined her school grades read reports 
from teachers 
they even had chrissie a sliverthin pretty girl with straight 
blond hair draw a picture of herself the 2inchhigh sketch spoke 
volumes to the psychologist about the youngsters poor selfimage 
finally the psychologist asked chrissie for three wishes 
a horse ranch the girl said after several moments a 
happy life and people who care who can help me through this tough 
time 
i havent really been happy since i was 2 or so i yell at my 
parents later i wish i hadnt done it theyre very good to me so 
i havent had a very happy life 
chrissie which is not the girls real name indeed had many 
problems the doctors concluded but she hardly fit the popular 
often mistaken stereotype of children who take ritalin 
first boys are eight times more likely than girls to be 
diagnosed as having add second chrissie wasnt bouncing off the 
walls in fact many youngsters recommended for ritalin treatment 
are not discipline problems and appear calm in most situations 
chrissie said psychologist arthur robin is a classic case of 
a kid whose add was not caught as a young kid preadolescents 
and teenagers who unexplainedly struggle with school for years 
often arrive at add clinics deeply depressed as a result of their 
attention problems 
the key was her inability to complete tasks and concentrate 
tests suggested she was weak in math easily frustrated 
dangerously depressed and had a poor selfimage 
chrissie knows she has troubles i have quite a problem paying 
attention in school ive had it since kindergarten she told a 
visitor in a brief break from testing i sometimes just have to 
get out of my seat i go to the drinking fountain and im not even 
thirsty its weird 
if i have a problem id really like to know about it 
fewer than 100 such add clinics operate around the country 
according to wade horn a psychologist who heads one at childrens 
hospital national medical center in washington dc nearly all 
start with the assumption that add is essentially a physiological 
disease that in most cases can be treated chemically 
some clinics simply juggle prescriptions using placebos and 
ritalin or other stimulant drugs alternately to find the most 
effective treatment they leave the followup and monitoring to 
others often the family pediatrician 
others like the detroit clinic employ pediatricians 
psychologists and social workers to look at the child in totality 
that means that counseling and changes in lessons or surroundings 
are often part of the treatment but at the heart of these clinics 
is the conviction that ritalin therapy helps most patients 
since it opened in september 1986 the add clinic here has 
examined some 600 patients and has a threemonth waiting list said 
dr sheldon brenner a pediatrician and codirector of the clinic 
at least threequarters were diagnosed as having add and about 85 
percent of those were placed on medication usually ritalin 
once treatment begins doctors rely on teacher questionnaires 
report cards and parents to monitor whether ritalin is helping the 
child in school and whether it is having side effects 
chrissies teacher wrote this description of her on a conners 
questionnaire the standardized form used to evaluate children 
suspected of having attention deficit disorder 
chrissie is not a behavior problem her teacher wrote i 
just do not have her attention 90 percent of the time on the 
day we had our first bit of snow last fall i was trying to help 
her understand something she looked at me and smiled saying i 
wonder what my kitten thinks of snow she never saw it before 
sometimes it seems her mind is way off somewhere else 
chrissie and her mother sat expressionless as the doctors later 
told them that ritalin and psychological counseling should make a 
difference 
her mother expressed mild surprise over the prescription 
ritalin has a bad name she said after the doctors had left the 
room i was somewhat surprised because i associated ritalin with 
hyperactivity 
how is chrissie doing after six weeks of ritalin and 
counseling chrissies teachers told doctors she had shown mild 
improvement in attention span and a marked improvement in her 
ability to sit still and stick to school work even with an 
increase in dosage to 30 milligrams a day she has exhibited no 
side effects 
progress but no quick miracles then for chrissie the ritalin 
therapy continues

one of jane eastons pupils takes 
the drug ritalin to calm his hyperactivity and help him pay 
attention she challenged a visitor to guess who 
chris was the obvious choice seated with three other boys at a 
semicircular desk in a special education class at scotch elementary 
school the thirdgrader fidgeted in his chair got up several 
times to sharpen his pencil drummed his fingers asked questions 
repeatedly and never seemed to hear the answers 
the guess was wrong instead the child on ritalin was a slender 
boy with flaming red hair who calmly sailed through a reading 
comprehension quiz and listened attentively to a lesson on 
homonyms easton says hes doing so well he probably will leave 
handicapped classes forever in the fall 
at scotch elementary they believe in ritalin and teachers 
point to cases like these to vindicate their faith in the 
controversial drug 
far from thinking ritalin creates passive zombies as some 
critics have charged teachers and parents alike in this affluent 
northwest detroit suburb seem convinced of ritalins track record 
for turning emotional and academic despair into success 
grades and attention span often improve and some youngsters who 
might have spent entire school careers isolated in classes for the 
disabled have managed to rejoin their regular peers with the help 
of the drug 
most of all teachers like easton resent the assertion by some 
that ritalin is merely a cynical way for schools to silence problem 
children while claiming they are trying to help them 
i read that this is the way we treat kids we cant handle 
its not true its just not true said easton whose daughter 
has taken the drug for four years 
while an estimated 12 percent of the nations 40 million 
schoolchildren take ritalin dr paul h wender a salt lake city 
psychiatrist and author of several books on attention deficit 
disorder or add believes 3to10 percent of all children have 
hyperactivity problems 
at scotch elementary approximately 5 percent of the 550 pupils 
drop by principal carl childresss office each day to take a pill 
several elements help explain why ritalin is commonplace at 
scotch elementary teachers and school administrators have attended 
seminars and taken other training to recognize symptoms of add 
area doctors are not only willing to prescribe ritalin but also to 
work with teachers and schools to monitor its success and parents 
generally seem to accept the professionalism good faith and 
judgment of the teachers and doctors 
when you first start talking to parents about this theyre 
devastated said principal carl childress then 90 percent 
react that it is a medical problem 
childress tells of a youngster named george who has taken 
ritalin for two years he had been assigned to a resource room 
where handicapped children get individual instruction for part of 
each day 
he had an incident every day of losing his temper punching 
someone or screaming in vile terms said childress now hes 
out of special education hes a winner 
childress like other educators insists we never recommend 
medication but thats only partly true if the schools 
psychologist social worker or reading specialist believes a child 
has add they know which doctors will nearly always prescribe 
ritalin 
at the top of the list is dr ruth robin a pediatrician who 
operates the attention deficit center in nearby southfield mich 
schools from all over michigan and northern ohio recommend her and 
prospective patients often wait 68 weeks for an appointment she 
now treats 1500 youngsters for add some as young as 3 almost 
invariably she prescribes ritalin or similar medication 
i work magic with the medicine she said in an interview in 
her office im willing to try things 
were talking about large numbers of kids who are getting a 
bum steer in life from kindergarten on some look like couch 
potatoes they dont all look alike she said 
but even ritalins advocates admit it isnt always 
wellmonitored teachers are supposed to provide crucial 
information enabling doctors to set the right dosage or to 
determine if drugs are necessary at all to academic success 
such monitoring is frequent when medication first begins after 
that there really isnt that much to do unless theres a 
problem the doctor said 
childress said robin and other add specialists typically send 
teachers questionnaires to fill out for the first 24 weeks of 
medication then gradually less frequently until we feel were on 
a steady course at a certain point we step out of the picture 
unless the teacher notices a problem 
still ritalin remains a last resort said childress 
teachers might for example put distractible children in study 
carrels desks with three sides blocked off so the child cant see 
in front or to either side 
but when weve exhausted all those things logged the 
classroom observations childress said we would just as soon 
get a recommendation to try something else

utah is a state of large closeknit 
families whose religion frowns on the use of liquor and caffeine 
it is also a state with the nations largest appetite for the 
stimulant drug ritalin 
the drug enforcement administration said that in 1986 pharmacies 
along the states wasatch front received 25000 grams of the drug 
used for hyperactive children or 1558 grams for every 100000 
population 
that figure compares to 1218 grams per 100000 residents of 
maryland the next highest ritalin state in new york the figure 
was 347 grams per 100000 
the reasons for utahs high use of ritalin are many they may 
point the way for the future in other parts of the country 
what we are doing here is in some ways ahead of many parts 
of the country said paul wender a psychiatrist and researcher 
at the university of utah 
utah has the youngest population of any state with nearly a 
quarter of its residents aged 5 to 17 it also leads the nation in 
the size of individual families about 43 children per household 
consequently it has the nations most crowded classrooms with 
246 students per teacher although utah ranks near the top of the 
list in the amount of state money 47 percent going to education 
it is last in per capita spending on education at 2372 per 
student 
so when the fragile balance in these overcrowded classrooms is 
threatened by disruptive children the pressures on parents and 
teachers are going to lead people to look for solutions and one 
of the solutions is medication said stevan kukic state director 
of special education 
in the salt lake school district an estimated 2 percent of the 
60000 students receive ritalin or one of its cousins for attention 
deficit disorder a syndrome that includes hyperactive as well as 
inattentive pupils 
it is becoming more acceptable in the parents minds and the 
teachers minds said julie miller a special education teacher 
whose son takes ritalin when the teachers see the dramatic 
effect it can have on problem students they want them medicated so 
they can learn 
sam goldstein a psychologist who saw 100 add children at his 
clinic last year estimates a quarter of his patients are referred 
by the schools another 25 percent come at the suggestion of other 
parents whose children take ritalin half his patients were sent by 
pediatricans 
utahs medical community also contributes to ritalin use 
reseachers at the university of utah are considered leaders in add 
study their philosophies are passed on to their students many of 
whom later set up practice nearby 
as a result salt lake has three clinics that specialize in the 
diagnosis and treatment of add children many larger cities across 
the country have none psychologists psychiatrists and 
pediatricians share information and refer patients for treatment 
in a community this size it is easier to make an impact with 
an idea especially an idea that appeals to people said 
goldstein 
parents of add children describe their successes with ritalin as 
more than appealing kathy miner cries when she talks about the 
effect ritalin has had on her 11yearold son jeremy 
there has been such a remarkable change in this child she 
said from the time he was 7 he talked about suicide now hes on 
the student council and is so thrilled with life 
mrs miner has joined others in a local support group for add 
parents the gatherings can be emotional laughter about the 
bruises and stitches their children have collected while rocketing 
around the house tears as they talk about the difference treatment 
has brought 
i wanted to share the knowledge with other families said 
the groups founder terri steineckert whose son tyler 11 has 
taken ritalin for more than a year it is very traumatic to put a 
child on drugs but if you have a good experience youre 
converted she said

three months ago mayor mary sheridan 
stopped attending council meetings changed her phone number and 
refused to explain why she had forsaken her duties 
for the last halfcentury ms sheridan had helped run the city 
as city clerk treasurer and finally as mayor in a homespun way 
that endeared her to the townsfolk 
but she has announced she will resign april 12 just 19 days 
short of her 51st anniversary in city government 
council president john mcmanus said monday he received ms 
sheridans onesentence resignation letter 
ive been kind of expecting it he said 
although ms sheridan 77 has said her doctor has told her to 
take it easy the letter doesnt indicate why she is leaving 
mcmanus the acting mayor said we know as much now as we 
did 
he said the council could choose a successor from a list of 
three candidates to be submitted by the hunterdon county democratic 
party but he is inclined to leave the seat vacant until the 
november elections 
we seem to be doing fine he said im certainly happy to 
fill the void 
with 3900 residents lambertville doesnt need a lot of 
governing 
the old mill and ferry town which spreads along the east bank 
of the delaware river comes to life in the summer when visitors 
from philadelphia and new york browse its art galleries antique 
shops quaint cafes bookstores and magnificent victorian homes 
an 85yearold twolane iron bridge carries cars and pedestrian 
across the wide lazy river to new hope pa 
ms sheridans ties to the town go back several generations she 
was elected in 1982 and reelected in 1985 but stopped attending 
meetings in january and shows up for work infrequently 
she spoke briefly with a reporter one day last month while 
walking down north union street in town asked about her absence 
ms sheridan replied medical problems just say i cant work 
because of medical problems 
my doctor says i have to take it easy now i dont want to 
talk about it anymore with that closing line she walked briskly 
across the street and into a fiveanddime 
so townspeople can only speculate about what happened 
some thought it was a political rift over whether to rehire 
police chief jack venettone who suffered a heart attack last year 
the council in january overruled ms sheridan and allowed him to 
return 
others thought it had roots in the citys fiscal mess in a 1987 
audit the department of community affairs division of local 
government services concluded that the mayor had taken it upon 
herself to maintain financial records and payroll documents which 
the treasurer was required to handle 
according to the audit the minutes of the monthly council 
meetings were not properly recorded vouchers lacked proper 
signatures and invoices the treasurer signed blank checks in 
advance which is prohibited by the state 
there was nothing criminal but there were certain things 
being done up there that werent according to hoyle said 
department spokesman richard harpster it was a momandpop 
operation 
since that time the council has asserted its independence and 
some say ms sheridan has not taken that well 
but no one really knows for sure what is certain however is 
the lifelong residents hold her in high regard 
i like her very much said mabel warner 83 i always 
thought she was very nice shes always good with people of limited 
incomes 
shes a woman whos cared for the city tremendously added 
businessman dean stephens

the fugitive leader of a coup attempt 
last year claims president corazon aquino is incapable of ensuring 
the suvival of the nation and he withdrew a pledge to avoid hostile 
acts against her government 
a statement carrying the signature of former lt col gregorio 
gringo honasan 39 was made available to news organizations 
wednesday by sources close to the renegade officer 
honasan escaped from a prison ship in manila bay last saturday 
chief military spokesman col oscar florendo said a nationwide 
search has turned up no trace of him 
honasan led an attempted coup on aug 28 in which at least 53 
people were killed among the hundreds wounded was mrs aquinos 
only son benigno iii 
honasan noted in the statement that his faction promised last 
november to refrain from hostile acts against mrs aquino to give 
her time to fulfill promises to improve the government 
we are now withdrawing that declaration the statement said 
it has become obvious by its own actions that the aquino 
administration is incapable of ensuring the very survival of this 
nation over the next few years we have to act and act boldly 
honasan who was arrested dec 9 said he and others jailed in 
previous coup attempts had been detained for months without formal 
charges or trial 
honasan played a key role in the feb 22 1986 military 
uprising that toppled president ferdinand marcos after thousands of 
civilians joined the revolt but he became disillusioned with mrs 
aquino after she succeeded to the presidency accusing her of weak 
and inept leadership in the face of the 19yearold communist 
insurgency

alarmed by the fast spread of aids in the 
country mexican authorities have begun a campaign called cascade 
education a novel approach that enlists those most likely to be 
afflicted to spread the word 
the campaign is aimed directly at male and female prostitutes 
the homosexual community street gangs and the poor in the hope 
that what they learn about aids prevention will cascade down to 
others in their own vernacular 
most of the effort is concentrated in mexico city a metropolis 
of 18 million people where highrisk people are hard to reach 
through newspapers and other standard means 
we are teaching them to become health care promoters and 
sending them into their communities said dr glorias ornellas 
hall director of the national center for aids information an arm 
of the federal public health department 
we believe that using the media to give information is not 
enough to change behavior patterns only facetoface contact can 
do that she said the best way is for them to reach their own 
communities in their own language that includes prostitutes 
reaching out to prostitutes homosexuals to homosexuals even 
deafmutes to deafmutes 
according to the center mexico had 1126 confirmed aids cases 
as of feb 1 and the number is doubling every seven months for 
every confirmed case an additional 50 to 100 people are becoming 
exposed to the virus said dr jaime sepulveda amor the 
departments director of epidemiology 
sepulveda who is also president of the governments national 
commission on aids prevention estimated during a recent interview 
the number of people confirmed to have aids will reach over 25000 
by 1991 making it the second or third leading cause of death for 
people in the 25 to 44 age group in mexico which has a population 
estimated at 817 million 
in the united states the number of aids cases reported since 
june 1981 has reached 57024 
since it was founded last year the information center has 
broadcast its services on radio and television and through bumper 
stickers posters keychains and matchbooks with condoms attached 
mexico recently received a donation of 10 million condoms from the 
us agency for international development 
the center also has trained dozens of mexico city residents in 
its cascade education program offering instructional rclasses but 
leaving the actual teaching process to each individual 
we give them the basics then leave the style of presentation 
in their own hands ornellas said 
the centers staff also trains streetgang leaders and visits 
jails to teach police officials and prisoners 
ornellas said many of the cascade volunteers from the streets 
originally visited the center to be tested for the aids virus and 
with counselling and support have joined the program she said the 
best of them are those who have tested positive 
one male prostitute in the program only known by his nickname 
of jaimito regularly visits mexico city markets to sing a 
ranchero song he wrote and recorded called what is aids 
ornellas called jaimito one of our great promoters 
a deaf mute who also is a male prostitute is another is cascade 
promoter 
he uncovered a whole subculture of deaf mutes who prostitute 
themselves off to make a living ornellas said we found that 
many feel they have no other way to earn money 
an initial health department survey indicated that about 30 
percent of the male homosexual community in mexico city has been 
exposed to the aids virus gerardo ortega zurita a cascade 
volunteer leader said cultural prejudices have made it very 
difficult for homosexual men to seek help 
theres incredible discrimination against homosexuals who are 
isolated from the centers of the country ortega said teaching 
them about aids is difficult they are forced to hide from the 
police and other government authorities 
ortega brings youths from what he calls controlled groups of 
prostitutes to the center to be examined and learn about aids 
prevention 
but there are others we cant get to who are more preoccupied 
with making a living than with taking care of their lives he 
said 
ornellas and other health officials say the cascade approach is 
essential not only in reaching previously hidden subcultures but in 
confronting many myths about aids 
weve come across many beliefs ornellas said some say 
aids is punishment from god and others that witchcraft can ward 
it off in a country with cultural setbacks that include religious 
beliefs ignorance and cultural taboos that do not allow the use of 
condoms we found that this program has worked 
currently ornellas said the center is receiving 50 visits and 
100 telephone queries a day from people wanting to find out about 
aids 
its new that they should come out at all she said 
the very lowest class is the most at risk and the hardest to 
get to theres a disrespect for life among them they dont care 
if they die 
as in other countries in latin america the center had to 
overcome initial resistance from the roman catholic church in 
distributing literature and promoting the use of condoms 
clerics are one way of reaching rural areas ornellas said 
we havent even started with rural people where you have 
whole families living in a single room children learn about sex in 
one room whats going to happen when aids reaches these rural 
areas

a web of unity has spread 
through the occupied lands in four months of violence drawing 
palestinian into committees for everything from tending emergency 
gardens to running the rebellion 
i think the idea is that this uprising is going to go on a 
long time said mubarak awad an arabamerican who promotes 
creation of civic action groups 
boys and businessmen of this middleclass town turned the earth 
of a vacant lot this week and planted squash tomatoes and 
cucumbers so their neighborhood will have fresh produce during 
curfews imposed by the israeli army 
last month in arura village an associated press reporter spoke 
with young arabs who stood midnight watch to warn of approaching 
soldiers 
nurses who got through an army blockade of jerusalems shufat 
refugee camp in february said health workers had formed a loose 
network that could rush aid to areas where where palestinians 
clashed with soldiers 
there are medical committees agricultural committees defense 
committees said saeb erakat political science professor at al 
najah university 
many of these committees work in the open and more secret 
groups organize strikes protests and political activities in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip he said 
erakat said the young leaders of secret groups generally are 
affiliated with factions of the palestine liberation organization 
they may be new faces but they will be new faces of 
leadership of the plo he said these are leaders who have 
become leaders because they are doing something to attack the 
occupation 
an underground network of ploaffiliated leaders has shown its 
strength by demanding and getting mass resignations of arab 
policemen in the occupied territories and nearly universal 
acceptance of commercial strikes 
israels attempts to crush the leadership with mass arrests have 
not stopped the clandestine leaflets 
communique no 11 told arabs to boycott institutions linked to 
israel and form popular committees in every place in city 
village camp and street 
leaflets urge people to cultivate the land increase 
selfreliance police themselves in the absence of arab policemen 
and start local manufacturing operations to lessen dependence on 
the israeli economy 
raja shehadeh a palestinian lawyer said neighborhood groups 
had multiplied in tandem with economic and social hardships created 
by the conflict that began dec 8 
i think its happening a lot especially for security and 
selfsufficiency said shehadeh who leads a human rights group 
in ramallah called law in the service of man people are 
experiencing a siege 
awad the arabamerican head of the center for the study of 
nonviolence in jerusalem said groups of 10 to 20 families have 
formed throughout the west bank with the largest numbers in beit 
sahur ramallah and nablus 
in beit jalla at al amal school instead of having a 
playground for kids they cultivate beans cucumbers onions 
tomatoes he said 
i think the idea is that this uprising is going to go on a 
long time and the israelis are going to push hard the next 
step is to make the palestinians feel hungry 
arab strikes and israeli restrictions have complicated 
deliveries of fresh produce but canned and packaged goods are in 
ample supply and there is no evidence of hunger 
many residents have stockpiled food others buy groceries from 
farmers or merchants homes rather than shops when fresh produce 
is available palestinians often cannot buy it because of curfews 
omar a businessman in el bireh said two dozen households in 
his neighborhood formed a committee at the end of march when the 
army sealed off the occupied territories for three days he said 
his four new hens had laid their first eggs 
less than a week later he joined six men and eight children in 
cultivating a vacant lot while they worked army trucks rolled 
past shops that were closed for most of the previous week by a plo 
ban on afternoon work and israels refusal to let them open in the 
morning 
the businessman who asked that his last name be withheld said 
the committee also had decided to start first aid classes form 
security patrols and build an emergency stock of food 
we made a request to every house to buy a big bag of flour 
and arranged to buy food from store owners even when their shops 
are closed he said 
people are now thinking of collecting wood for baking 
omars wife said israel cut off supplies of fuel oil and gasoline 
two weeks ago 
samir another committee member said the grassroots groups 
would be harder for israel to handle than labor unions social 
associations and schools 
there is no infrastructure the israelis can control he 
said to put it down theyll have to arrest everybody and in 
that case youre not succeeding youve lost control

whats a birthday without a party or 
in the case of this southern illinois city whats a party without 
a birth date 
a city committee planning edwardsvilles 175th birthday bash has 
disbanded stymied over the actual year the community of 12480 was 
born 
you know everybody was going every which way really nobody 
could agree on one date kenny krumeich a member of the birthday 
celebration committee said tuesday that was the main problem 
that was the stumbling block 
shortly after the committee was formed last summer it learned 
that a common pleas court held its first session in the town in 
1813 krumeich said 
two history books set the year of edwardsvilles founding in 
1819 but its incorporation as a town did not come until 1853 and 
its incorporation as a city came 20 years after that 
see the dilemma asked former committee member gail 
wolfskill we couldnt seem to uncover when the actual date was 
that was the problem 
city officials will take up the issue of the citys birth in the 
future said mayor raymond rogers but he added no celebration will 
be held this year 
i hate to see that go by without any celebration krumeich 
said but he added we also have a 200year celebration down the

the federal communications commission is 
advising consumers to beware when using hotel hospital and pay 
telephones to make operatorassisted calls 
the agency has received 260 complaints since january from irate 
callers who were billed by a company they had never heard of at 
rates that were several times the rates charged by the major 
longdistance companies 
in one case the charges were 10 times higher the fcc said 
the complaints have prompted the fcc to begin looking into the 
practices of alternative operator services known as aos companies 
which have emerged to compete in a 7 billionayear market that 
until recently was served only by american telephone amp telegraph co 
weve never seen a situation quite like this addressed by the 
commission describing the complex nature of the problem aos 
companies pose said greg vogt chief of the fccs telephone 
enforcement division 
we dont want to have a kneejerk reaction that could kill an 
industry he said adding that the commission needs more 
information before deciding whether federal action is warranted 
aos companies began forming within the past two years ago to 
fill the void left when atampt stopped paying commissions to hotels 
and motels on the longdistance calls made by their guests 
atleast some of the aos companies kick back money to the 
contracting hospital hotel motel or other business 
the aos companies now estimated to number around 40 handle 
calls mainly made by the transient public in hotels motels and at 
pay phones as well as hospitals and universities they handle 
creditcard collect and thirdparty billed calls 
typical complaints the fcc said are that callers are given no 
indication that an aos company is handling their calls or that they 
will be billed at higher rates than those of the company whose 
longdistance credit card they are using 
aos rates are not regulated by the fcc the commission regulates 
the rates atampt can charge but not the rates of any other 
longdistance companies because none is large enough to control 
market prices 
in complaints investigated by the fcc the aos companies have 
refunded the disputed amount vogt said 
at an establishment served by an aos company callers who dial 
0 for an operator are routed to the aos an operator gets 
billing information and then sends the call over a line the aos 
leases from one of the longdistance carriers like atampt or mci 
communications corp 
many of the callers who end up connected to an aos company are 
those using a credit card issued by a local bell phone company or 
atampt since use of those cards require callers to start by dialing 
a 0 other companies cards require callers to dial a local or 
800 number to place their call 
most of the aos companies have billing contracts with the bell 
companies which means callers receive the aos charges along with 
their monthly local bell phone bill some aos companies also accept 
payment by other credit cards such as mastercard and visa 
the fcc advises that callers ask an operator what company they 
work for what rates they will be charged and how they will be 
billed before placing the call if they are dissatisfied they 
should find another phone the fcc says 
several states have begun considering regulation of aos 
companies because of complaints and some have issued consumer 
alerts 
aos companies say theirs is a new and growing industry to which 
consumers havent yet become accustomed the major aos companies 
say their operators are trained to identify themselves to callers 
before placing their calls 
vogt said however that some aos companies can place automated 
calls which substitute bong tones for a live operator to 
instruct callers on how to proceed with a credit card there is no 
federal requirement for aos companies to identify themselves he 
said

the number of americans caught in foreign drug 
busts jumped 22 percent last year the state department reported in 
an effort to scare us tourists out of taking controlled 
substances on overseas vacations 
as we approach the busy travel season many americans are 
getting ready for that longawaited trip abroad for some the trip 
will become a nightmare the department said tuesday in a report 
to congress 
police abroad seized 1242 americans on drug charges last year 
compared with 1013 in 1986 the report said 
the biggest increases in drugrelated arrests of americans were 
in mexico and jamaica where governments are under pressure from 
washington to get tough on narcotics 
of the 3041 americans taken into custody in foreign countries 
41 percent were suspected of drug violations 
americans have been arrested for possessing as little as a 
third of an ounce of marijuana the report said 
it added those americans who assume there is no real danger 
in buying or carrying just a small amount of drugs on their 
overseas trip may be in for a very unpleasant surprise 
many travelers also assume that as american citizens they 
are immune from prosecution under foreign laws 
that was underscored tuesday by a spanish courts conviction of 
conan owen a 23yearold virginia photographer on cocaine 
importation charges despite us government belief that owen was 
an innocent traveler duped by an acquaintance into carrying the 
drugs into spain he was sentenced to six years in jail 
the 10 countries that arrested the most americans on all charges 
last year were mexico 990 jamaica 346 canada 267 the bahamas 
196 west germany 128 britain 124 the dominican republic 74 
japan 60 spain 53 and israel 52 
at years end 596 americans were serving jail sentences 
overseas 
mexico canada britain and spain have inmate transfer treaties 
that permit offenders to serve their sentences in jails in their 
homeland but fewer prisoners than normal were able to return to 
the united states last year because us federal prisons didnt 
have enough space 
riots among cubans at federal penitentiaries in oakdale la and 
atlanta ga aggravated the crowding 
the largest number of inmate mistreatment complaints from 
americans abroad came from mexico notably those in the san luis 
rio colorado prison near hermosillo 
about onefourth of the 164 americans arrested in that area of 
northern mexico complained of mistreatment and us officials 
found such reports credible and made a vigorous formal protest in 
august the report said 
since then no reports of mistreatment at that prison have been 
received the report said 
several countries prevented us assistance to americans with 
dual nationality thesoviet union as in the past refused to grant 
access to three prisoners with us nationality and obstacles also 
were raised in cases in cuba egypt italy and botswana the report 
said 
the us embassy in romania also received complaints from 
american tourists detained at the border for alleged customs 
violations most of the americans were fined in dollars scarce 
currency in romania and released within 24 hours 
the number of americans incarcerated in saudi arabia declined 
last year mostly because that country relaxed punishments against 
foreigners accused of breaking the islamic ban on alcoholic 
beverages 
instead of sentencing liquor possessors to jail saudi arabia 
now usually deports them the report said 
americans in thailand benefited from a round of pardons granted 
on the 60th birthday of the king several us prisoners were 
released and a few others had their sentences reduced still 30 
americans remained in thailands substandard prisons at the end 
of the year 
the state department spent 46000 on medical assistance and 
food for needy us prisoners more than 20000 of which went to 
american inmates in thailand according to the report

the longawaited financial turnaround for us 
agriculture has been led by a twoyear economic boomlet in the 
livestock sector according to an agriculture department report 
since the fourth quarter of 1985 hog and cattle farmers have 
benefited from generally higher prices and lower feed costs the 
report said feed expenses declined by 24 billion during 
198587 while hog and cattle sales receipts increased by 47 
billion 
further poultry and egg sales increased 15 billion in 1986 
before declining last year 
according to usda economists the net cash income of farmers 
whats left over from gross cash income after deducting cash 
expenses rose to a record 57 billion in 1987 from 52 billion in 
1986 and 473 billion in 1985 some decline is expected this year 
to between 50 billion and 55 billion 
the report by the departments economic research service was in 
the current issue of agricultural outlook magazine and was written 
by gregory hanson and richard kodl 
more than 80 percent of the 10 billion increase in net cash 
income from 1985 to 1987 went to livestock producers the report 
said strong growth in net cash income was shared by most major 
livestock enterprises in 1986 and by hog dairy and beef farms in 
1987 
the darker side was among crop producers who saw feed grain 
receipts decline from their 1985 peak contributing to the recent 
financial stress on midwest crop farms 
however the strong rebound in livestock earnings has provided 
an important offset in this region the report said five of 
the top 10 cattle producing states and seven of the top 10 hog 
producing states are located in the northern plains from north 
dakota to kansas and western corn belt illinois iowa minnesota 
missouri and wisconsin 
the gains in livestock receipts and big increases in government 
payments translated into increases of 70 percent to 80 percent in 
the net cash incomes of farmers in the two regions the report said 
farmers used their higher incomes to pay down more than 6 
billion of farm business and household debt annually during 
198487 the report said they are now in a position to reap 
substantial benefits in 1988 from continued livestock profits and 
from recovering crop profits 
the overall debt crunch of the early and mid1980s has 
subsided the report said by the end of this year business 
debt in agriculture likely will have fallen 55 billion to 60 
billion or nearly onethird since 1983 
it added farmers recent financial progress is evident in the 
closely watched debttoasset ratio which measures the degree of 
lender security and the farmers use of their earnings and capital 
to finance farming operations 
after climbing to 23 percent in 1985 which meant farers owed 
23 for every 100 worth of assets economists said the 
debttoasset ratio nationally declined to an estimated 17 percent 
to 19 percent by 1988

china has been given approval by the 
agriculture department to buy an additional 2 million metric tons 
of us wheat at subsidized prices 
acting undersecretary thomas o kay said tuesday that china has 
already bought more than 49 million tons of us wheat under 
previously announced authorizations under the departments export 
enhancement program or eep 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat 
under eep arrangements exporters can sell us commodities at 
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as 
bonuses or subsidies 
the subsidies have ranged from less than 20 to more than 40 
per ton of wheat or in the range of 54 cents to 109 per bushel 
the soviet union also has been a big buyer of us wheat under 
eep with purchases totaling more than 118 million tons in the 
last year an additional 1 million tons of eep wheat for the 
soviets were authorized earlier in the week

public comments are being sought on how to 
define a person for purposes of determining federal limits on 
payments to farmers the agriculture department said tuesday 
there are limits on federal payments to individuals including 
benefits paid under commodity price support programs the 
conservation reserve program and some other programs where direct 
payments are made 
additionally the proposed rule would determine whether 
foreigners will be eligible to receive certain program payments 
in budget legislation late last year congress included a number 
of provisions designed to tighten loopholes in usda farm payment 
regulations beginning with 1989 crops 
the law provides for example that to qualify for payments a 
person must be actively engaged in farming by providing a 
significant amount of capital equipment or land and personal 
labor or management to the enterprise 
a basic limit of 50000 per person annually is set on direct 
deficiency payments but this can be ballooned to as much as 
100000 maximum depending on a persons interest in other entities 
the term person can include individuals corporations 
associations charitable organizations or other entity as 
determined by usda 
a recent study by the departments economic research service 
says the law requires the secretary of agriculture to give fair 
and equitable treatment to trusts and estates and the beneficiaries 
thereof and provides that spouses may be separate persons if their 
farming operations were separate prior to their marriage and 
continue to be operated separately

the number of highincome americans has risen 
sharply during the reagan administration and so has their share of 
the total federal tax burden 
the 1 million or so couples and individuals whose incomes put 
them among the nations wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers paid 261 
percent of all personal income taxes collected in 1986 the 
treasury department says that share is up from 181 percent in 
1981 when president reagan took office 
in its study issued tuesday the department did not say what 
income level would place taxpayers into that highest 1 percent 
but it issued a parallel set of statistics showing that during 
the same period the share borne by those making over 100000 rose 
from 152 percent of the total to 306 percent 
meanwhile the portion of taxes paid by those with incomes under 
50000 the majority of americans dropped from 668 percent in 
1981 before enactment of acrosstheboard tax cuts to 457 
percent in 1986 the department said 
those in between making 50000 to 100000 paid the rest 
with their share rising from 18 percent to 237 percent 
the treasury attributed part of the higher tax payments by the 
wealthy to the extraordinary level of capital gains realized in 
1986 in anticipation of the 1987 rate increase on capital gains 
in 1986 the maximum tax rate on capital gains which are 
profits from the sale of stock real estate and other investments 
was 20 percent knowing the rate would rise to 28 percent in 1987 
investors sold billions of dollars worth of assets in the closing 
days of 1986 which boosted their total incomes for that year 
that selloff helped capital gains account for nearly 25 percent 
of the total income of the richest 1 percent of americans in 1986 
in 1985 capital gains accounted for 15 percent in 1981 11 
percent by contrast capital gains make up on the average less 
than 2 percent of the income of the other 99 percent of americans 
the preliminary analysis is based on a sampling of tax returns 
filed last year reflecting income earned in 1986 
the study made no attempt to fully explain the growing share of 
taxes paid by the richest americans however once its analysis is 
complete the administration is likely to claim that the increase 
results from the big 1981 acrosstheboard tax cut that congress 
enacted at reagans behest 
that law slashed the top marginal rate from 70 percent to 50 
percent it since has been cut to 33 percent 
the administration reasons that reducing tax rates gives workers 
and investors incentive to produce and save more 
inflation and economic growth have helped boost incomes and 
thus increase the number of taxpayers who make more than 100000 
a year in 1986 about 12 of every 1000 couples and individuals 
topped that level the analysis found those taxpayers paid 43 
billion in taxes in 1981 77 billion in 1985 and 115 billion in 
1986 
the irs says more than 12 million couples and individuals 
earned over 100000 in 1985 an increase of 63 percent over 1982 
the number earning over 1 million a year more than doubled from 
1982 to 1985 to 17312 
between 1981 and 1986 taxes paid by those with incomes between 
50000 and 100000 increased from 51 billion to 89 billion the 
burden on those under 50000 dropped from 190 billion to 172 
billion 
about half of americans have incomes under 35000 a year 
including those who are too poor to pay taxes they paid 75 
percent of the individual income tax in 1981 and 64 percent in 
1986

americans are easing into their middle years 
as growing numbers of maturing baby boomers boost the nations 
median age to a record high of just over 32 years 
the 3544 age group represents the leading edge of the 
postworld war ii baby boom and is the fastestgrowing segment of 
the us population the census bureau reported tuesday 
and the population segments aged 85 and over and 7584 rank 
second and third in growth since 1980 the bureau said 
this combination helped boost the nations median age to 321 
years as of last july 1 the highest ever 
the graying of america is documented by its increasing 
age observed bureau statistician louisa miller 
up from 318 in 1986 the median means that half of all 
americans are older than that age and half younger 
by race blacks remain younger than whites although both groups 
are maturing 
for whites the median age hit 33 for the first time up from 
327 in 1986 black median age was 272 up from 269 and the first 
time that group had surpassed 27 
the nations median age first reached 30 in 1950 but the rapid 
growth of the baby boom that was then occurring pulled it back down 
in the following years the baby boom consists of the estimated 20 
million americans born between 1946 and 1965 
with the maturing of the baby boomers the median has begun 
moving in the other direction the growing elderly population has 
also helped raise the median as improved medical care extends 
lifepsans 
the repercussions of the baby boom are many and varied 
miller said they will continue to affect the united states for 
many years to come 
they are now at the age where they have more discretionary 
income and the effect can be seen in the nations culture and 
marketing she said 
the generations arrival spurred a boom in sales of baby 
products it then proceeded to overwhelm the school system 
following up with creation of a national orientation toward 
teenage music and styles 
now as the baby boomers set up more and smaller households 
they are prompting a boom in housing sales and household goods 
marketing experts say 
further down the road once they begin to reach retirement 
age they will obviously have a great effect on the direction the 
country takes miller added 
meanwhile the boomers are being followed by the much smaller 
baby bust generation leaving fastfood outlets retail stores and 
others offering first jobs searching for employees she said 
the boomers boosted the 3544 age group by 338 percent between 
1980 and 1987 to some 344 million people the bureau reported 
the 2534 age group remains the most numerous with 435 million 
members but that is up only 168 percent from 1980 the study 
noted 
when americans now in that age group move on they will have few 
replacements 
between 1980 and 1987 the 1824 group declined by 97 percent to 
273 million and those aged 1417 fell 11 percent to 144 million 
even the 513 group slipped 11 percent to 308 million but 
those under 5 jumped 116 percent in the baby boom echo they 
totaled 182 million 
the secondfastest growing segment was aged 85 and over 
increasing 28 percent to 22 million the 7584 group was third 
jumping 203 percent to 77 million americans in the 6574 group 
increased 134 percent to 177 million 
turning to the small groups born in the depression and world war 
ii the 45 to 54yearold group increased only 21 percent to 233 
million and those 5564 were up 15 percent to 220 million

its fast its colorful its as spiffy as can 
be its usa today on tv 
executive producer steve friedman unveiled a prototype of the 
syndicated daily television show and his fourperson anchor team 
tuesday at one of a series of news conferences this one in the 
rainbow room upstairs from his old office at nbc where he was 
executive producer of today 
usa today the television show premieres on sept 12 but 
is already a hit having been sold in 118 markets covering 85 
percent of the country that gives it higher coverage than any 
syndicated show except wheel of fortune friedman said 
the promotional reel friedman showed reporters promised stations 
considering buying the show that it would take them into the 
90s 
its a fastpaced world and i think a lot of the media hasnt 
caught up said friedman after showing the tape the pace of the 
promotional show complete with commercials was fast to spin heads 
not surprisingly friedman assured reporters that usa today 
wont be a traditional news show but rather will rely on upbeat 
humaninterest stories polls and interviews 
since its based on the colorful successful young national 
newspaper it doesnt have any baggage from the past he said 
we dont have to worry about what ed murrow said 
the show is the first product from gtg entertainment the 
partnership between former nbc chairman grant tinker who is also 
former president of mtm productions and gannett the publisher of 
usa today and the nations largest newspaper group gtg is also 
producing network entertainment shows 
usa today the television show will be a half hour daily 
an hour on weekends the show will be fed to stations each day via 
satellite at 430 pm eastern time friedman said 96 of the 
stations will broadcast the show in what he considers its ideal 
time period the hour between the evening news and the beginning of 
prime time 
friedman has assembled a goodlooking cast of network veterans 
to anchor the four segments based on the four sections of the 
newspaper edie magnus from abc as front page anchor kenneth 
walker also formerly with abc as money editor bill macatee 
of nbc for sports and robin young also formerly with nbc for 
life 
the show will preview the next days edition of usa today 
but not necessarily have the same stories as the newspaper 
it will be topical but to be successful it will have to be 
different said magnus we will be doing what would be the next 
days lead the night before 
macatee suggested he might have coaches other than baseball 
managers wear uniforms for a segment 
or lets have the head of an airline dress like a pilot for a 
day to see how it fits see how people react he said 
a daily poll will be the centerpiece of the show friedman said 
the promotional tape featured a poll on marriage using clips from 
movies to illustrate the results for example body heat 
illustrating a question about infidelity 
academy awardwinning composer john barry who wrote the theme 
was featured in an interview in the promotional tape describing the 
music much like the show as having a happy laidback feeling 
but with a sense of urgency 
usa today isnt the only newspaper getting into the act the 
christian science monitor which has a radio show is holding a 
news conference later this week to announce its own television show

hands shielding swollen eyes from the glare of 
television lights the three little girls squirmed uncomfortably in 
the hospital room as they were displayed as survivors of a poison 
gas attack 
the girls are among five victims being treated in the united 
states for chemical burns to the lung eyes and skin iran says 
they are survivors of a march 16 chemical attack by iraq on the 
kurdish village of halabjah 
four of them met reporters tuesday in an event organized by the 
iranian mission to the united nations the arena for a bitter 
propaganda war between iran and iraq the persian gulf enemies have 
been fighting for 7 years 
one patient nazanin hassan 30 was not shown to reporters 
because she is in the intensive care unit 
the tehran government says iraq bombed its own citizens with 
chemical weapons killing 5000 and injuring 7000 after members 
of the restive kurdish minority welcomed invading iranian troops to 
halabjah 
mohamed azizi a 25yearold university student said iraqi 
forces attacked the village several times in response to kurdish 
unrest but azizi said even from the shelter of his basement he 
knew the march 16 attack was different 
we smelled the gas he explained through an intepreter we 
knew it was not the other kind of bomb the ordinary kind 
azizi said from his hospital bed that when he ventured outside 
hours later he saw streets strewn with the victims of what doctors 
in the united states suspect was mustard gas a world war i weapon 
outlawed worldwide since 1925 
any door you opened there were children men and women dying 
dead azizi said his words punctuated by rough coughs i saw a 
lot of people in cars as many as 10 11 12 in a car they were 
dying 
he said he and other stunned survivors began streaming out of 
halabjah 
we tried to run out azizi said we didnt want to see 
that 
but he said that once outside he was soon sickened by the gas 
my eyes felt heavy it was hard to breathe eight or nine 
times i threw up i smelled gas he recounted 
doctors at st johns episcopal hospital in new york citys 
borough of queens said all five of those brought to new york 
suffered lung and eye damage and from burns one child is also 
showing signs of bone marrow damage said dr deborah 
liefdienstag head of the pediatrics department 
she said the longterm prognogis for a gassing victim is unclear 
i can tell you what a gunshot wound is i can tell you whats 
going to happen to the patient she said 
but i dont know whats going to happen to these children i 
dont know whats going to happen to their lungs in six months and 
i dont think anyone else does either including all the experts 
weve spoken to 
dr liefdienstags young patients were clearly uneasy when 
iranian officials escorted journalists to their room several 
doctors expressed concern about infection one speaking on 
condition he not be identified said emphatically that the news 
media visit wasnt our idea 
iran transferred small contingents of survivors from hospitals 
in tehran to hospitals in major european cities and to st johns 
dr meyd atabaki an iranian who is an attending physician at 
st johns said all five brought to new york had to be sedated at 
first before they could be treated 
they cried for 24 hours after they got here dr 
liefdienstag said 
hospital officials say psychiatrists are following the progress 
of all five patients particularly the children who were orphaned 
by the attack 
they are innocent bystanders who were in the wrong place 
at the wrong time dr liefdienstag said of javan mohammed 
abdollah 12 and her sister rezen mohammed abdollah 9 and kobra 
mohammad also 9 
dr victor burnett head of the department of medicine said he 
and the other doctors at st johns consulted experts in chemical 
injuries from the university of ghent in belgium and from the us 
army 
amir zamani a first secretary at the iranian mission said iran 
sent about 100 victims to hospitals abroad because irans hospitals 
ran out of room 
the united nations which earlier confirmed several iraqi 
attacks with outlawed mustard gas and nerve gas during the war has 
sent a team to investigate the halabjah attack 
iraq meanwhile is accusing iran of using the banned weapons 
on monday it asked for a un team to go to baghdad to examine 88 
soldiers it says were gassed

income tax cuts in the united states have 
encouraged cuts in 10 other major countries according to a study 
distributed by the brookings institution 
the movement also reflects the almost universal 
recognition of the distortions and inequities created by high tax 
rates years of inflation and ineffective tax preferences says 
joseph a pechman presidentelect of the american economic 
association who edited the report 
brookings is a private policyresearch organization its study 
includes analyses by tax officials from australia canada denmark 
france west germany italy japan the netherlands sweden 
britain and the united states 
it does not deal with the soviet union where communist party 
leader mikhail s gorbachev has announced a plan for a progressive 
income tax higher taxes on higher incomes it comes just as 
noncommunist countries are making their rates less progressive 
none of the new top rates in the 10 noncommunist countries is 
as low as the 33 percent that goes into effect for this year in the 
united states but japans 1984 top rate of 88 percent will be down 
to 76 percent by 1990 and west germanys 56 percent is dropping to 
53 percent 
the highest french rate is going down to 57 percent from 65 
percent while italys is dropping from 65 to 60 percent 
of the 10 only britains top rate of 60 percent will hold 
steady from 1984 to 1990 it was reduced from 83 percent in 1979 
when conservative prime minister margaret thatcher embraced the tax 
cut movement 
one contributor to the study sijbren cnossen of erasmus 
university in rotterdam holland criticizes the flattening of 
rates in the united states 
in most european countries it has long been realized that 
poverty issues must largely be addressed through the welfare 
system he writes 
as a result of these countries pervasive social security 
systems the income distribution has become much less unequal than 
say 40 years ago 
he does not mention japan where the social security system is 
weak compared to those of western europe 
he says the european arrangements have benefits and costs not 
yet fully understood 
the system appears to be headed for a significant overhaul as 
populations age rapidly in the next 30 years he predicts 
an overview of the world tax situation was given by kenneth c 
messere from the staff of the organization for economic cooperation 
and development the rich mans club of governments in western 
industrialized countries 
though vertical equity progressive taxation has been thrown 
out of the tax policy door it is lurking in some areas of tax 
reform the idea being not to soak the relatively few rich but to 
protect the many poor he says 
france japan and the united states take the view that the 
poor should not pay income tax denmark and sweden believe all 
or nearly all citizenas should contribute even if they get more 
back in transfer payments than they pay in taxes

hispanic leaders say they are setting aside 
their cultural and regional differences this presidential election 
year and hope their unity will help them win some clout in shaping 
the democratic and republican party platforms 
former new mexico gov toney anaya said hispanics representing 
various countries of origin couldnt even agree 20 years ago on 
what to call themselves 
weve moved beyond that he said tuesday at the national 
hispanic leadership conference its an evolving process 
the conference which meets during presidential election years 
and represents 21 national organizations drew hispanic leaders 
from across the country to washington this week to draft a national 
agenda 
weve got a good crossrepresentation of hispanics from across 
the united states said pablo sedillo nhlc chairman 
cubans puerto ricans mexicanamericans central and south 
americans are participating democrats and republicans 
conservatives and liberals were proving we can come together and 
we are going to make a difference sedillo said 
more than 35 million hispanics are expected to vote in 
novembers general election according to the group 
more than 300 delegates attending the conference were set to 
vote today on an agenda leaders hope will be included in the 
democratic and gop platforms 
the issues that are going to be recognized and come out of 
this conference will speak very clearly and concretely as to what a 
presidential candidate should be doing to represent the needs of 
hispanics education employment housing civil rights health 
said sedillo of santa fe nm 
we are arriving at a consensus that will be very strong 
anaya said 
in its draft agenda the nhlc calls for steps to stem the high 
school dropout rate only 509 percent of hispanics complete high 
school compared with 777 percent of the general population 
if i had to single out any one thing that would be it to 
keep our youth in school said al zapanta of dallas director of 
government affairs for arco oil and gas co 
we have to educate them so they can take their rightful 
position in society he added we keep filling the bottom rung 
but theyre not moving up 
the conference also seeks a oneyear extension for undocumented 
aliens to apply for amnesty and wants the president to immediately 
suspend the deportation of salvadoran and nicaraguan nationals from 
the united states and it wants a hispanic appointed to the supreme 
court 
employment housing and health are also high on the agenda for 
many of the leaders concerned about the poverty and living 
conditions of many hispanics 
there are places in this country where there is a third world 
situation in the rio grande valley northern new mexico the 
barrios of la the bronx of new york sedillo said 
the whole idea is that we as hispanics want to join in 
partnership with the government with the private sector its time 
that they recognized the talent and resources we have within our 
own community its important we add the question of 
selfsufficiency the community wants no handouts we want to join 
in partnership sedillo said

democratic presidential contender jesse jackson 
narrowly outpolled by rival michael dukakis in colorados caucuses 
is criticizing the state party here for the slow pace of its count 
and the party chiefs ties to dukakis 
the democratic caucuses were held across colorado on monday 
night but significant returns were not reported until tuesday 
afternoon by the state democratic party 
even before dukakis pulled out his victory jackson accused 
state democratic chairman buie seawell of being biased and 
politically unethical and deliberately controlling the 
process by remaining as party chairman after publicly supporting 
dukakis 
the state chairman endorsed mr dukakis jackson told 
reporters in kenosha wis on tuesday you cannot very well be a 
fair referee and coaching another player 
he added that the partys long and slow count represents a 
certain ineptness it heightens suspicions 
seawell countered that the reverend jackson is just wrong i 
have never known him to just attack for his own political gain but 
that appears to be what this is 
he said his staff of six people had worked until 3 am tuesday 
and was back on the job by 830 am that day 
jackson also contended that colorado democrats had changed 30 
caucus sites as late as friday or saturday without telling his 
campaign it comes very close to obstructing justice he said 
jacksons campaign manager gerald austin complained about the 
colorado situation tuesday to paul kirk chairman of the democratic 
national committee 
dnc spokeswoman julie anbender said the committee had contacted 
the state party and theyve assured us that theyre doing 
everything they can to get the results out 
returns from 77 percent of colorados 2784 precincts showed the 
massachusetts governor leading with 4029 delegates or 443 
percent to jacksons 3528 delegates or 365 percent 
the uncommitted delegates totaled 1547 or 163 percent and 
tennessee sen albert gore jr received 236 delegates or 27 
percent 
if the caucus results hold up at colorados congressional 
district and state democratic conventions in the next few weeks 
dukakis would win 20 national convention delegates while jackson 
would gain 17 and another eight would be uncommitted those 
calculations are based on returns from 77 percent of the precincts 
in the state 
on the republican side vice president george bush swept most of 
colorados 36 gop delegates to the republican national convention 
cornering over 70 percent of the vote in straw polls taken at 
caucuses monday night 
actual gop delegate selection will come at congressional 
district conventions and the state convention in june 
dukakis and jackson had hoped to use the colorado caucuses as a 
springboard for tuesdays wisconsin democratic primary 
dukakis went on to win that contest but since there was no 
clear colorado victor when the wisconsin polls opened tuesday 
morning it was not thought to have had much of an effect 
still the dukakis campaign hailed the colorado win bob 
johnson a spokesman for the campaign in colorado said the victory 
demonstrates that mike dukakis can win in any region of the 
country 
johnson also said he thought the count was fair to the best 
of my knowledge the party officials conducted the caucuses in a 
fair and appropriate manner he said 
dukakis himself commenting on the colorado contest to reporters 
in boston said as far as he knew it was run fairly and well 
colorado will send 51 delegates to the democratic national 
convention with six of them super delegates who include 
seawell and gov roy romer another dukakis supporter the monday 
night caucuses began a complicated fourtier process of selecting 
45 of those delegates

new yorks harlem hospital said her hospital has cared for 37 
infants with aids even though it gets no money for the care from 
public or private sources 
abrams told of a 9yearold child whose mother died of aids six 
months ago and who now lives with her grandmother 
the physician said the child does not automatically qualify for 
medicaid just by having the virus and that to certify her as 
having the disease itself would result in her being taken from her 
grandmother and placed in line for foster care even though that 
would not be in the childs best interest 
help me get this child on medicaid so i dont have to sneak 
her into the hospital when she needs treatment abrams said 
each child with hiv aids virus infection needs medicaid whether 
the parent makes a million dollars or zero dollars 
michelle valentine the young virginia woman adopting a baby 
girl with aids told the commission she is having trouble getting 
permission to take in a second child 
youre single we cant consider you she said she has been 
told 
then in exasperation she said the typical young yuppie 
couple wants one of these kids like they want a hole in the head 
smithies said child placement agencies should rethink the family 
criteria they use when placing children with aids 
she cited instances for example where gay men have been 
absolutely extraordinary as care givers 
we have to expand our vision of what a family is abrams 
added 
the three women were among 14 witnesses heard by the commission 
during the first of four days of hearings this month

eastern airlines will appeal an injunction and 
contempt citation even though it has dropped plans to sell its 
northeast shuttle to another subsidiary of texas air corp 
easterns president says 
on tuesday us district judge john h pratt accepted the 
companys report of compliance with an order he issued last month 
and said eastern will no longer be in contempt once it informs 
employees it has dropped plans to sell the shuttle 
on march 10 pratt had found eastern in civil contempt of an 
earlier injunction issued in a labor dispute with the international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers 
at a brief hearing easterns president philip bakes said the 
financially troubled carrier had abandoned the sale plans 
bakes assured the judge that eastern would comply with the 
order but outside the courtroom the airline executive reiterated 
the companys plan to appeal the contempt citation and the 
injunction that bars the shuttle sale 
air shuttle lp the subsidiary that was to buy the bostontonew 
yorktowashington shuttle withdrew its application with the 
transportation department to complete the 225 million sale bakes 
said 
pratt ruled that the proposed sale violated a 1987 injunction 
that required eastern to maintain current working conditions that 
injunction prohibited eastern from transferring ground crews to 
another subsidiary 
the iam contended that the proposed transactions were intended 
to undermine the union 
bakes told the judge the company acted on advice of its lawyers 
and never believed we were violating an order of the court

with michael dukakis again holding the upper 
hand the democratic presidential candidates descended full force 
on new york today for a twoweek run to the crucial april 19 
primary 
dukakis picked up backtoback wins in colorado and wisconsin 
this week over jesse jackson to follow up on home turf victory in 
connecticut before that jackson had piled up victories in 
michigan and illinois 
even before the polls closed in tuesdays wiscnsin contest 
dukakis and tennessee sen albert gore jr were prospecting in new 
york hoping to stake a claim on the mother lode of the primary 
season thus far 
i hope its a sign of things to come dukakis of his 
wisconsin win 
jackson too was upbeat abut his prospects 
we go to new york with a good campaign a broadbased 
campaign momentum a clear messge a message that applies to new 
york he said tuesday night 
at stake in the new york primary are 255 delegates at the 
national convention only californias delegation a 336member 
giant will be larger and that primary isnt until june 7 
we think that if we can win new york were going to be in a 
good position to dominate the last third of the primaries said 
paul bograd dukakis new york campaign manager but new york 
will be critical to that 
no way you can underestimate the importance of this one 
said john marino executive director of the state democratic 
committee and a political operative of gov mario cuomo 
cuomos presence is felt in the new york primary race as it has 
been to some extent in the entire campaign reluctant to run for 
president himself cuomo has been equally reluctant to endorse any 
other democrat 
cuomos apparent indecision has fueled speculation for months 
that he might want a deadlocked convention and desperate democrats 
turning to him offering the nomination cuomo has insisted he 
doesnt want that but thus far has refused to rule out accepting a 
convention draft 
there is also a republican primary on april 19 in new york with 
102 delegates at stake but it is little more than a formality as 
vice president george bush rolls toward the gop nomination 
on the other hand the democratic primary could provide 
important answers including 
can dukakis keep up the momentum hes regained with this weeks 
victories in wisconsin and colorado and convince party leaders 
that he deserves the nomination 
can jacksons solid support among minority voters and the 
backing of several prominent new york labor leaders overcome jewish 
uneasiness and produce the new york victory his campaign now needs 
will gores decision to put most of his remaining eggs in the 
new york basket prove to be anything more than a windfall for 
television stations who run his paid ads 
along with cuomo most of the states other major democrats 
such as new york city mayor edward koch and sen daniel patrick 
moynihan have remained officially neutral 
recent polls among new york democrats have dukakis leading the 
field with support ranging from 37 percent to 45 percent depending 
on the poll jackson has been consistently second at just under 30 
percent while gore and simon have yet to crack double digits in any 
of the polls 
anticipating dukakis victory in wisconsin bograd declared 
tuesday evening that the campaign had become clearly a twoman 
race between dukakis and jackson 
while the dukakis camp was ready to write off gore who finished 
a distant third in wisconsin the tennessee senator has been 
campaigning hard here for more than a week hes also hired new 
york political consultant david garth who runs kochs campaigns 
and who occasionally advises cuomo 
gore has been courting new yorks politically important jewish 
community and has been attacking jackson and dukakis on the issue 
of support for israel 
if that message has any impact it could hurt dukakis most 
jacksons support among new york jews is already minimal following 
his 1984 hymietown gaffe however dukakis wife kitty who is 
jewish has been campaigning in the jewish community 
jackson is relying on his strong minority support coupled with 
a growing acceptance among white voters to win more than the 26 
percent he garnered in the new york primary four years ago 
jackson plans a big television buy in new york a tool he hasnt 
used much in other states he also has the support of influential 
labor leaders such as stanley hill executive director of the 
120000member new york city municipal workers union and jan 
pierce a top official with the communications workers of america 
bograd dukakis new york campaign manager says the 
massachusetts governor will spend at least 1 million on his new 
york effort others put it as high as 3 million the massachusetts 
governor also has the support of some of the top officials from the 
states politically powerful teachers unions

child abuse claimed an average of three lives 
a day in the united states last year according to statistics 
supplied by the national committee for prevention of child abuse 
there were about 225 million reports of child abuse and neglect 
nationwide last year the committee said projecting that 1132 of 
the children died of their injuries slightly fewer than the 1181 
reported in 1986 
the public outcry at the tragic death of lisa steinberg should 
have been repeated a thousand times over last year anne cohn 
executive director of the group said tuesday 
cohn was referring to the widely publicized beating death last 
year of 6yearold elizabeth steinberg in new york which last year 
led the nation with 166 reported abuse deaths that was double the 
total for california which was second 
the group also surveyed 1250 people nationwide and found 
widespread support for more intensive investigation of all child 
abuse reports even as some states are screening their reports more 
carefully 
the survey showed 67 percent of the people questioned believe 
public child welfare agencies should investigate all reports of 
child abuse regardless of the seriousness of the charge 
the group said differences in screening and reporting methods 
may have been responsible for wide swings among states from the 
previous year in reported child abuse cases 
illinois reported 30 percent more cases last year and kansas 25 
percent more to register the biggest increases ncpca said in a 
survey of states 
new mexico hawaii and louisiana showed declines of more than 20 
percent 
the survey of states showed 25 states and the district of 
columbia reporting increases over 1986 including 10 states that 
showed jumps of more than 10 percent in reports of child abuse 
the survey of peoples opinions on child abuse was conducted for 
ncpca by the new york polling firm of schulman ronca and bucuvalas 
inc results had a margin of error of plus or minus three 
percentage points 
in the separate state survey figures for six states were not 
available and four others said some deaths were still being 
investigated

in turning to john shepherd a former american 
bar association president to fill the no 2 position at the 
justice department attorney general edwin meese iii has found a 
strong conservative ally 
shepherd a 62yearold st louis attorney wrote a 3400word 
article last september for the national law journal supporting 
president reagans nomination of judge robert bork to the supreme 
court and attacking borks critics 
on the eve of hearings into the nomination later rejected by 
the senate shepherd said borks philosophy that courts should 
restrain themselves in interpreting the constitution is 
synonymous with judicial integrity 
far from being an unprincipled activist judge bork is a 
highly principled jurist well within the jurisprudential 
mainstream shepherd wrote 
but prior to serving as the president of the 340000member aba 
in 1984 and 1985 shepherd was well known to conservative activists 
in key policy roles in the reagan administration 
in 1977 he first came to the attention of california 
conservatives then behind the effort to get ronald reagan elected 
president in 1980 
while representing the hoover institute associated with stanford 
university in a case then shepherd met most of the officers of the 
conservative think tank that provided much of the philosophic 
underpinning for the socalled reagan revolution within a year 
shepherd was named an overseer of the institute 
shepherd started his practice after getting a law degree from 
st louis university in 1951 representing personal injury victims 
in liability suits often on a contingency fee basis getting paid a 
percentage of any settlement or damages awarded 
as the bar associations president he vigorously defended that 
practice against assaults by the medical community in response to 
mounting malpractice claims and other defendants in liability suits 
contingency fees are a nocure nopay system that is the key 
to the courthouse for many many citizens he said jurors have 
to understand that marcus welby is not our system of medical care 
however shepherd also recognized that lawyers also have an 
image problem he released during his tenure as the abas president 
a fiveyear study concluding that attorneys could reduce their 
clients legal costs by 75 percent through better management 
we must move in that direction he said 
during that time his law practice also prospered setting up his 
own firm shepherd sandberg amp phoenix in st louis in 1980 
shepherd evolved from a plaintiffs attorney to a defense lawyer in 
liability cases 
his firms clients now include some of the nations corporate 
giants among them the monsanto co general dynamics and ford 
motor co 
a former bookkeeper from shepherds law firm who claimed she had 
an affair with shepherd went on trial in st louis circuit court 
last month and was convicted of stealing more than 147000 from 
the firm 
denise sinner who was fired in february 1987 was accused of 
writing checks to herself from the law firms accounts and admitted 
using the money to pay bills and buy luxury items 
she claimed shepherd had told her to write checks to herself 
but shepherd denied that he had had an affair with her or that he 
had authorized her to write the checks 
sinner 29 also was convicted of making a false statement to 
the government she had claimed that a doctor had diagnosed her as 
having terminal cancer

new york realestate magnate donald trump says 
he agreed to pay a 750000 civil penalty stemming from his 
attempted takeover of two companies in order to avoid a long drawn 
out legal battle with the government 
the payment settles a suit filed by the federal trade commission 
over his 1986 stock purchases in holiday corp and bally 
manufacturing corp 
both cases involved the purchase of stock options through bear 
stearns amp co which in turn bought actual shares the ftc 
contends the exercise of stock options was covered by rules 
requiring that buyers notify the government before purchasing more 
than 15 million worth of voting stock in a company and wait 30 
days before completing the transaction 
trump said tuesday he was advised by his lawyers and the 
investment firm that stock options were exempt and he should be 
reimbursed by bear stearns a bear stearns spokeswoman had no 
immediate comment

new york sen alfonse damato denies calling 
defense secretary frank carlucci and the joint chiefs of staff 
cowards for not doing more to oust panamanian strongman manuel 
antonio noriega 
my recollection of the conversation was that i said the 
inaction would be perceived as cowardly damato said tuesday 
through a spokeswoman 
carlucci made the allegations in a letter to damato that 
followed a telephone conversation the two had last week after 
learning damato had denied the alleged namecalling defense 
department spokesman col arnold williams said i think the 
letter probably speaks for itself 
in the phone call damato had complained that the defense 
secretary was willing to send 3200 soldiers to honduras but would 
not send a senior military officer to panama to tell noriega to 
leave said jack kinnicutt a spokesman for damato

michael dukakis says he doesnt expect to land 
any knockout blows in the democratic presidential nomination fight 
but his wisconsin landslide makes him the man to beat in new york 
on april 19 and at the partys nominating convention in july 
no matter what the selfstyled democratic convention power 
brokers say 
and it may mean that jesse jackson the biggest surprise of the 
year has peaked halfway through the primary and caucus season 
in another time a solid democratic regular like dukakis 
carrying bluecollar wisconsin might not seem like much but by the 
reckoning in use for the unpredictable 1988 campaign dukakis 
scored several important successes in a single tuesday night 
he won a state he had to win by more than anyone expected 
and at the moment of jesse jacksons greatest momentum in any 
other year jacksons showing would have been spectacular but this 
week basking in the glow of his stunning michigan caucus victory 
pictured on the cover of time and newsweek drawing boisterous 
crowds from one town to the next he could not match the 
expectations that had been set for him 
dukakis probably succceeded in winnowing the field as well 
with sen paul simon expected to suspend active campaigning later 
this week that will mean one less white candidate to siphon off 
white votes in future primaries in new york pennsylvania and ohio 
where jacksons black constituency is substantially larger than it 
was in wisconsin 
he benefited from sen albert gores failure to emerge as a 
strong challenger in the race gore was gaining less than 20 
percent of the vote far behind jackson and now has failed utterly 
in a monthlong bid to turn his super tuesday victories into 
success outside the south already dukakis aides are trying to 
undermine gores campaign in new york raising questions about the 
large loans he is relying on 
dukakis victory should reassure the party leaders who were 
beginning to wonder if a son of new england would ever be able to 
carry one of the great lakes industrial states that in turn 
should put a damper on the incessant talk of drafting mario cuomo 
into the democratic race and increase the odds that cuomo will 
lend his support 
and along the same lines dukakis has been working the phones 
hoping a victory in wisconsin might set off a movement of party 
leaders members of congress and governors to his side not so much 
because they are enamored of him they are not but because he is 
their best chance to stop jackson who they fear would lead the 
party to the defeat of a lifetime if he won the nomination and led 
the ticket against george bush this fall 
none of this is to say that dukakis is now the inevitable 
nominee he tried to portray himself that way a few weeks ago and 
it almost made him the inevitable governor of massachusetts through 
the end of his term in 1990 he campaigned lackadaisically 
seemingly worried more about collecting endorsements than votes 
and finished third in illinois before being buried under jacksons 
landslide in michigan 
and in a year in which gary hart dropped out of the race twice 
in which the muchsought after iowa caucus prize proved worth 
little to winner richard gephardt and in which jackson has broken 
new ground dukakis may yet have to fend off a charge or two before 
the nomination can be his 
still dukakis demonstrated not only that he could win this 
week but that he could do so on his own terms 
under pressure from party officials to do something anything 
to regroup and stop jackson he gambled that he could do so without 
assaulting him and driving away the black votes so essential to a 
general election victory 
when he offered criticism he did cautiously as when he said it 
was a bad idea for his rival to become involved in panama but 
then quickly added that jackson had issued a clarification of his 
own position 
instead he attacked the reagan administration sharply in 
speeches and in a new television commercial that evoked images of 
human suffering in the era of ronald reagan 
this administration has walked away from the american dream 
theyve walked away from the basic contract that says if you work 
hard and pay your taxes and live within the law you have a right 
to a good job and the right to a life where you dont have to go 
to bed every night worried about whether that job will still be 
there in the morning he said in a milwaukee speech 
more than that he allowed his staff to schedule him into more 
informal settings serving lunch to senior citizens at one stop and 
visiting children in a hospital in another

a tired parachutists fatigue and his 
preocance says 
the death saturday of ivan lester mcguire was accidental 
although a man who has jumped 800 times ought to remember his 
parachute franklin county sheriffs capt ralph brown said 
tuesday 
there are no indications of foul play or suicide and blood 
tests indicating whether drugs or alcohol were present in his 
system should be available next week brown said 
mcguire 35 was carrying a video camera mounted on his helmet 
and was filming an instructor and a student at franklin county 
sports parachute center the videotape was mangled in the crash 
but salvaged by investigators 
the videotape showed that mcguire jumped from the airplane and 
the jump was going smoothly until the parachutes worn by the 
instructor and the student deployed and mcguire hurtled below them 
it kind of appears he reached for his parachute and didnt 
have one brown said you could only see the instructor and the 
student falling on the video but the release for his parachute is 
on his right hip and when that right hand goes down the left hand 
comes forward and it comes into camera view 
then the pictures get to moving real fast because hes 
approaching the ground at 150 mph the only thing the camera shows 
is the ground coming 
mcguires body found in woods about 1 miles from the airfield 
mark luman of louisburg the pilot of the plane could not be 
found for comment and had no telephone listing but brown said the 
pilot wasnt in any position to see what happened in the back of 
the plane 
there was no answer at the parachute center tuesday 
nancy fayard wife of parachute center owner paul fayard was 
quoted in tuesdays news and observer of raleigh as saying no 
one was aware that he got on the plane without a parachute of 
course no one knew or they would have stopped him 
although an expert jumper mcguire could have forgotten to put 
on his parachute because of fatigue or preoccupation with his video 
equipment she said 
mrs fayard said mcguire worked the third shift at northern 
telecom inc a manufacturer of telephone switching equipment and 
usually left the club at noon to get to work on saturday she 
said he stayed until 230 pm to shoot the video 
hes a real perfectionist when it comes to his video 
photography and hed been working a lot on it she said the 
best we can figure is he became so preoccupied with the video and 
then being fatigued that his mind was on the video

benjamin and patrick binder who spent their 
first seven months joined at the head are seriously underdeveloped 
but have the potential to lead normal lives said doctors preparing 
to release the babies from the hospital 
the separated siamese twins now 14 months old will return to 
germany in the next few days physicians at johns hopkins hospital 
said tuesday benjamin should begin crawling soon and will go home 
to ulm west germany with his parents patrick will go to a german 
hospital for observation 
there is no reason for us to think they will not continue to 
improve said dr ben carson a member of the medical team that 
has treated the infants since they were admitted in august 
they have made very substantial progress in the past few 
months and were very hopeful the potential will culminate in 
normal existence carson said at a news conference 
however dr mark rogers stressed that the boys are not now 
normal their development is equivalent to that of 2to5monthold 
babies 
carson said he was unwilling to project the mental and physical 
level the boys will reach but when the twins return here for 
evaluation next year doctors will be able to predict fairly 
accurately the boys future development 
the twins have had several setbacks since they were separated in 
a 22hour operation during the labor day weekend by a 70member 
medical team in october their temperatures rose inexplicably for 
several days the latest occurred march 13 when patrick choked on 
formula fed to him through a nasal tube 
rogers said its unknown if the incident will have longterm 
effects although patrick had reached the point of turning over 
before the incident and has not returned to that level 
benjamin is at about the level as when he entered the hospital 
and is expected to begin crawling soon the doctors said 
because they were joined at the head the twins were not 
normally developed when they arrived the trauma of the operation 
and long hospital stay account at least partially for the 
developmental lag carson said 
at the time of the separation operation doctors had given it a 
5050 chance of success 
certainly in terms of a medical or technical feat it has 
clearly been successful carson said 
he said there were 48 cases in medical history of siamese twins 
joined at the head this was the first separation where both twins 
lived their kind of joining at the back of the head with a 
shared vein was the rarest he said 
in february doctors implanted titanium mesh plates in the 
opening at the back of their heads created by the separation of 
their joined skulls and a shared vein 
benjamin has a bald spot on the back of his head from the 
operation but if he grows his hair long he can comb it down 
said dr craig dufresne patrick has a full head of hair 
the twins parents have refused to speak with reporters here 
before the separation at hopkins they sold their story to a west 
german magazine 
their mother theresia parlagi binder has been at the hospital 
with the boys and has taken benjamin outside in a carriage doctors 
said tuesday 
rogers said the doctors donated all their time and care and 
hopkins treated the boys at no cost except for a small portion of 
the about 800000 expense covered by german government insurance

despite police declarations of war on 
cheap potent crack cocaine drug turf wars are transforming the 
citys lowincome housing projects into twilight zones of violence 
death and terror 
families are selling crack families are using said 
charlotte tillman director of the bayviewhunters point foundation 
youth drug counseling its a way of life survival in the 
projects 
her program has 36 clients a waiting list of 18 and has to turn 
away referrals tillman a social worker for 23 years said the 
crack situation is the worst shes ever seen and theres no end 
in sight 
were losing a generation of young people tillman said 
in one night you can make at least 400 off one person buying all 
night on heroin you nod out after a couple hundred dollars 
worth of the drug on crack you go on for days or as long as your 
heart can stand it 
crack a rocklike smokeable form of cocaine that goes for as 
little as 5 for a whitish pebble is intensely addictive and 
potentially deadly to users dealers and anyone crossing their 
paths 
on jan 22 daniel foster visited his old hunters point 
neighborhood stepping off a bus just after midnight into a crowd 
of men and women many high on crack 
they asked him if he was a cop said police inspector earl 
sanders he told them no and kept walking then they asked 
him if he was from sunnydale turf of a rival gang but when he 
said no someone in the crowd said he was lying then they began 
to chase him 
police said someone fired a pistol at least four times hitting 
foster once in the back he died less than an hour later 
on jan 29 police broke up a battle between two competing gangs 
in a mission district housing project there were 32 shots fired 
from weapons such as an m16 rifle 12gauge shotgun and handguns 
on jan 17 a 13yearold retarded boy in the potrero annex 
housing project three blocks from mayor art agnos home was fatally

in cash and 302 guns said police lt jim molinari 
we do put organizations out of business but somebody else 
always seems to pick up the banner and carry along i think were 
failing quite frankly said jerry smith of the california bureau 
of narcotics enforcement 
the city has 47 projects with 6800 units and 17000 residents 
but its security force merged with city police five years ago 
because of budget constraints during the past year the city has 
doubled its narcotics officers to 157 and the state recently 
assigned 18 more narcotics agents to the region 
betty brooks a 20year resident of potrero annex and a san 
francisco housing authority commissioner said residents live in 
constant fear 
everyone in the area has been victimized by the shootings the 
rash of burglaries she said no one has gone untouched in some 
manner i mean you have to get to your car to the bus stop 
the rand corp ranks san francisco no 5 nationally among major 
cities in cocainerelated hospital admissions with 290 for every 
1000 
at san francisco general dr don wong said that like other 
metropolitan public hospitals 1 in 10 of the approximately 200 
infants born there each month are addicted because of maternal drug 
use 
the city has 11 foster homes to care for 17 medically 
fragile infants suffering from drug alcohol or other medical 
problems there are two or three newborns always on the waiting

the opposition newspaper la prensa 
which reopened six months ago after a governmentordered shutdown 
said it will cease publishing indefinitely today because the 
sandinistas have withheld newsprint 
the leftist government which controls the purchase and sale of 
newsprint in nicaragua said its supply was exhausted and claimed 
it had warned newspapers to conserve paper until a new shipment 
arrives later this month 
la prensa suspends publication said the banner headline in 
tuesdays editions of the afternoon newspaper future undecided 
because of state control of paper read another headline 
we dont have paper to publish tomorrow or on the following 
days because the government alleges that there isnt any paper in 
the country but we know there is said cristiana chamorro 
assistant director of la prensa 
the ministry of industry said in a statement in tuesday morning 
papers that it didnt have newsprint because a shipment scheduled 
for march has been delayed it said a shipment was expected by 
april 17 once this shipment is received the ministry of 
industry will proceed to distribute paper proportionally according 
to the established mechanisms it said 
the ministry said it told la prensa and two other newspapers el 
nuevo diario and barricada that the contraction of paper for the 
year had suffered delays and that all possible efforts were being 
made to assure the first shipment during the month of may 
it said the government had urged the papers to take precautions 
against using up their stockpiles before the end of that month the 
progovernment barricada said it too was running low on paper 
but planned to publish today 
miss chamorro said la prensa was told to hold on until march 
not the end of may she said the paper shortage marks the first 
time la prensa has been forced to interrupt service because of the 
government since it was allowed to reopen oct 1 1987 after a 
15month shutdown the paper was allowed to reopen under the terms 
of a regional peace plan signed by the sandinistas 
la prensa said the paper shortage could be avoided if we were 
permitted to handle imports ourselves 
the government saying la prensa was promoting us aggression 
in this wartorn country forced the newspaper to cease operations 
june 26 1986 
la prensa acting as a voice for the interests of a powerful 
aggressor has been elevating its levels of provocation and 
disinformation through trying to justify north american 
aggression the government said at the time 
the newspaper whose mottos are serving truth and justice 
and without press liberty there is no liberty has been a 
vocal opponent of the sandinista regime and has suffered censorship 
and shutdowns many times before 
its directors say the sandinistas betrayed the country after the 
1979 revolution that toppled the rightist regime of the late 
anastasio somoza 
nicaragua is at war because the marxistleninist government 
betrayed the nicaraguan people by deviating from the original idea 
of the revolution violeta chamorro la prensa coowner said 
after the 1986 shutdown 
her son pedro joaquin chamorro lives in miami and is a leader 
of the contra rebels who with us aid have been trying for more 
than six years to oust the sandinistas 
la prensa founded march 2 1926 is nicaraguas oldest 
newspaper it suffered censorship repression and shutdowns during 
the somoza regime too 
violeta chamorro is the widow of pedro joaquin chamorro la 
prensas former director who was slain in 1977 the newspaper 
offices were destroyed in the revolution and la prensa was rebuilt 
only to suffer a major ideological division among its editors 
shortly afterward 
about 80 percent of the staff including pedro joaquin 
chamorros brother xavier left to establish the newspaper el 
nuevo diario 
cristiana chamorro daughter of pedro joaquin chamorro said la 
prensa didnt circulate during holy week because of a shortage of 
newsprint 
whats strange about the case is that the newspapers barricada 
and el nuevo diario have published as normal she said 
barricada the official voice of the national sandinista 
liberation front and el nuevo diario the progovernment 
newspaper didnt publish for four days over the easter holidays 
as is customary in nicaragua 
a secretary for barricada director carlos fernando chamorro said 
the newspaper also is running short of paper but plans to publish 
today she spoke on condition of anonymity barracada has loaned 
newsprint to la prensa before

military leaders for the sandinista 
government and the contra rebels have renewed ceasefire 
negotiations to hammer out key details for an agreement to end a 
grueling war now in its seventh year 
little progress was reported tuesday during 2 hours of talks in 
this remote outpost near the costa rican border 
both sides accused the other of misinterpreting a peace plan 
signed two weeks ago and of violating a truce that started march 21 
the only positive aspect of tuesdays meeting was an agreement 
to continue the talks until the mechanics of the ceasefire can be 
worked out 
the discussions were resuming today 
hopes for the peace agreement signed march 23 started to fade 
over the weekend when the usbacked contras postponed a meeting 
scheduled for today in the capital of managua between highranking 
government and rebel officials 
the sandinistas argued that the meeting should be held because 
it was set out in the peace agreement 
in putting off the talks the contras cited among other things 
the lack of progress in the technical meetings held last week 
the talks tuesday and today were held to define zones in which 
the rebels are to gather outline security measures and detail how 
supplies will be delivered during the 60day ceasefire which 
formally started on friday 
aristides sanchez a director of the nicaraguan resistance the 
contra umbrella group said the main concern is to guarantee the 
physical security and morale of the contras he described the 
talks as extremely delicate 
contra spokesman bosco matamoros said the rebel delegation 
accused the sandinista troops of systematically violating the 
truce which was agreed on march 21 at the start of the three days 
of talks that led to the signing of the peace plan he said the 
sandinista forces fired mortars and longrange artillery into areas 
proposed as ceasefire zones for the rebels 
we consider this part of the strategy to wear down the 
resistances forces he told journalists at the meeting at sapoa 
maj gen joaquin cuadra the sandinista delegations leader 
denied any ceasefire violations but he acknowledged that last 
week there were small incidents 
he said that was practically inevitable as long as the two 
sides were not separated and their armies roamed the rural 
mountains plains and jungle 
the governmentrun newspapers have charged the contras with 
breaking the ceasefire 
both sides offered differing views on the major issue of the 
laying down of arms which is not specifically dealt with in the 
ceasefire agreement 
cuadra called it indispensable a basic condition for the 
plan to work 
the contra combatants pointing to the vast number of 
nicaraguans carrying arms supplied by the government say they will 
never put down their weapons 
as long as there is no real democracy there will be no laying 
down of arms said sanchez when there is reconciliation the 
arms wont be necessary 
the contra leaders proposed april 12 instead of today for the 
next highlevel meeting the sandinistas suggested saturday or 
april 15 
the two sides cant agree on how the visit will be handled 
the rebels are insisting on free movement during their stay in 
the capital saying they want to meet with a variety of opposition 
groups 
the government claims it has to guard their security cuadra 
said its not a visit for a political campaign 
the sandinistas who came to power in a 1979 revolution signed 
the peace agreement at a time when they faced strong internal 
political social and economic pressures 
the government backed by the soviet bloc retreated on several 
hardline positions they had vowed never to hold talks with the 
rebels discuss internal policies or start political amnesty 
proceedings 
the first 100 of 3310 political prisoners were released march 
29 in accordance with the peace agreement 
the contras approached the pact at a time of improved 
battlefield strength but they saw the last of their ussupplied 
military aid expire at the end of february in signing the accord 
the contras agreed to accept only humanitarian aid from a neutral 
organization such as the international red cross

a plan to clear hundreds of square miles of 
timber around giant redwoods in sequoia national forest was halted 
by a federal appeals court which said the government approved the 
logging too hastily 
but the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruling on tuesday 
came too late to block logging of about half the nonredwood timber 
in widely scattered areas of the forest a different panel of the 
court refused to halt that operation last december while the appeal 
was pending 
if you were a tourist in a redwood grove of the sequoia 
national forest instead of finding a lush naturalvegetation 
forest you would find dirt and redwood trees alone said ralph 
bradley a lawyer for the sierra club which went to court last may 
to block the logging 
theyre going in with tractors and removing everything from 
brush to pine to oak he said 
the court ordered a ban on further logging in seven tracts in 
the forest 200 miles south of san francisco saying the government 
approved an untested logging plan without a proper environmental 
analysis 
an industry spokesman however claimed victory because all 
logging was not banned around the towering sequoias some of them 
400 to 500 years old 
the forest is not shut down and the mills are going to 
continue to operate said michael haglund who represented sierra 
forest products and sequoia forest industries this is a much 
more limited injunction than the sierra club sought its much more 
of a victory for us than it is for them 
the sierra club went to court after the us forest service 
decided that nine timber sale contracts would cause no significant 
damage and would not require fullscale environmental impact 
statements assessing the effects on the forest 
us district judge edward price last fall refused to halt the 
logging saying the dispute was one over management of the forest 
the environmental group appealed 
haglund said tuesdays injunction prevents logging of about 9 
million boardfeet of timber at least temporarily until an 
environmental plan is developed in a fiveyear plan covering the 
entire forest the forest service proposes logging of 80 million to 
90 million boardfeet a year haglund said 
the sierra club had hoped the court would address the fiveyear 
plan for the entire forest a subject not mentioned in the ruling 
but bradley said the ruling at least will require the forest 
service to take review the plan 
in approving the clearcutting plan the forest service said it 
would help to regenerate the redwoods by creating areas of bare 
mineral soil and sunlight but the court quoted a professional 
forester as saying the method was experimental and unproven 
bradley said experts have told him it ultimately would destroy 
the redwoods 
by tractorlogging almost assuredly you will end up with 
damage to the roots and often exposure of the roots he said 
the other problem is tremendous soil compaction the water that 
normally would hit the ground and percolate down and provide 
nourishment instead erodes off of the land

jesse jackson broadened his support in wisconsin 
more than he deepened it showing an ability to appeal to more 
diverse elements of his party even while his share of white votes 
still lagged exit polls say 
while his secondplace finish to massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis on tuesday can only hamstring jacksons chances in new 
yorks april 19 primary analysts said the wisconsin results did 
indicate that he has continuing appeal to democrats 
his support was more evenly distributed among the demographic 
groups than it was in the past he is doing better said doug 
muzzio an abc news poll analyst the question is how much better 
he can do and how fast 
dukakis meanwhile had a broad victory winning support across 
nearly all income age education and ideology groups he won 
bluecollar workers union household members and catholic voters 
all important constituencies in delegaterich new york 
but the exit polls indicated a certain lack of enthusiasm in 
dukakis support a factor that has the potential to be exploited 
by jackson if he finds a way to draw more white votes or by 
tennessee sen albert gore jr 
abc and cbs newsnew york times polls said jackson won 23 
percent of the white vote in wisconsin while an nbc news poll said 
he had 28 percent his share of the black vote was over 90 percent 
the surveys said 
while his white support was well over the 8 percent he got in 
illinois on march 15 the abc and cbstimes figure was about even 
with jacksons showing in connecticut last week and less than his 
32 percent in vermont on march 1 
we may be looking at his ceiling here if the past is any 
guide hes going to be in that quarter of the white vote as the 
upper limit muzzio said theres something that hes bumping 
up against 
there were positive signs for jackson even in his defeat he was 
rated favorably by 55 percent of democratic voters in the cbstimes 
poll forty percent viewed him unfavorably 
it isnt that jackson isnt liked said kathleen a 
frankovic a cbs news pollster its just that dukakis is liked 
better dukakis had a 74 percent favorable rating 22 percent 
unfavorable 
jacksons supporters if fewer in number were more 
enthusiastic the cbstimes poll said 60 percent of his voters were 
strongly for him while 31 percent had some reservations gores 
strong backers also led his weak ones by 21 while dukakis 
supporters were split evenly 45 percent strong 44 percent with 
reservations 
dukakis support is softer than either gores or jacksons 
said pama mitchell another cbs poll analyst stronger supporters 
are more likely to go to the polls an important factor when a race 
is close 
the nbc poll also showed some dissatisfaction with dukakis among 
his own supporters four in 10 said they wished some other 
candidate were running at the same time more than six in 10 
democrats overall said dukakis would make the best nominee of the 
current contenders 
jacksons support from white voters in other states has been 
strongest among liberals with more education and higher incomes in 
wisconsin it was more evenly spread albeit still weighted toward 
liberals muzzio said 
the nbc poll had jackson winning 23 percent of the conservatives 
who voted democratic and 24 percent of the moderates as well as 42 
percent of the liberals gores strongest showing was among 
conservatives also 23 percent 
in all the results again showed a dual electorate a black 
electorate and a white electorate with jackson winning only the 
blacks said muzzio for example abc said dukakis won bluecollar 
voters narrowly 41 percent to 37 percent for jackson when all 
were considered but far more strongly 47 to 27 among just the 
white bluecollar workers 
for dukakis it was a substantial victory muzzio said for 
jackson he said hes in a middleamerica state where hes 
getting 23 percent of the white vote its good but the question 
is can he expand it 
the polls had margins of sampling error of about 3 points

as military transport jets brought in 
the first of 1300 additional us troops panamas military regime 
said it was willing to negotiate with the opposition then 
inexplicably withdrew the offer 
the government which is controlled by the defense forces chief 
gen manuel antonio noriega issued a statement tuesday saying it 
was willing to meet with opposition leaders in talks mediated by 
the roman catholic church 
later the government said the statement was void and sent a 
messenger to news organizations offices to reclaim it no 
explanation was given for the move and government officials met 
late into the evening 
opposition leaders have said they will not enter such talks 
until the government frees all political prisoners allows 
opposition news media to reopen and promises that noriega will be 
willing to resign and leave panama 
the government statement had not addressed those conditions 
also tuesday leading opposition activist ricardo arias calderon 
asked for the protection of the catholic church after four carloads 
of state security police surrounded his home calderon who is 
president of the christian democratic party fled his home before 
the police arrived and appeared later with the rev oscar brown 
the auxiliary archbishop of panama city 
us military transports began touching down about once an hour 
at howard air force base near panama city on tuesday in an airlift 
that was to bring another 1300 troops 26 helicopters police dogs 
and equipment into the country by late thursday 
the extra forces were ordered after a fiveweek campaign of 
economic and political pressure failed to oust noriega whose 
strength lies in the 15000strong panamanian defense forces 
noriega was indicted in the united states in february on federal 
charges of trafficking in colombian cocaine us economic 
sanctions have since prompted panamas banks to close and the 
government has been unable to meets its payroll 
the reinforcements were sent after reports us citizens were 
harassed by panamanian soldiers and several american reporters were 
briefly arrested during a police raid on opposition headquarters in 
a panama city hotel 
the government has repeatedly accused the reagan administration 
of preparing to invade panama 
the first us troops arrived tuesday in c141 starlifter 
transport jets that brought airborne military police based at fort 
bragg nc other troops were due from fort mead md and fort 
ord calif 
there is no limit on the length of their stay 
the us government has said the additional soldiers are needed 
to protect the 10000 troops in the former panama canal zone and to 
guard the canal american citizens and installations 
a contingent of 500 military police arrived in midmarch the 
new arrivals will bring american troop strength to about 11800 
army officials say there were no plans for the new troops to 
leave the old canal zone which was turned over to panama in 1979 
as part of the 1977 treaties that cede control of the canal to 
panama by the year 2000 
the us national security adviser lt gen colin l powell 
said in santa barbara calif on tuesday that the united states 
has no plans to send more troops to panama but would not 
eliminate that possibility 
governmentcontrolled newspapers on tuesday quoted panamas 
health ministry as calling the new us troops potential aids 
carriers 
the ministry was quoted as saying tests by the centers for 
disease control in atlanta showed us military personnel have a 
high rate of infection with the aquired immune deficiency 
syndrome virus 
knowing their clinical history we can do no less than exhort 
our population to abstain from having any intimate contact with 
these soldiers the ministry was quoted as saying 
a spokesman for the centers for disease control said it does not 
test military personnel 
the countrys catholic leader archbishop marcos mcgrath has 
been asked by president oscar arias of costa rica and prime 
minister felipe gonzalez of spain to mediate an end to panamas 
crisis 
but the government has accused mcgrath of siding with the 
opposition staterun newspapers have called the archbishop who 
was born in philadelphia a tool of the yankees

georgia sen sam nunn said if he were to 
emerge from a brokered democratic national convention this summer 
with the partys nomination he would go on to win the presidency 
if i were nominated i think id be elected nunn said 
tuesday after a speech to college students in cochran 
however nunn told a dublin gathering hes not likely to get the 
nomination 
i think its most likely that someone running now will get the 
nomination said nunn but its not impossible for someone 
whos not running to get the nomination 
but if that happens its not likely to be somebody from the 
moderateconservative wing of the democratic party he noted 
its more likely to be someone who would come from the more 
liberal wing of the democratic party 
whether its rev jesse jackson or massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis or anyone else if they dont go to the 
convention with a majority i dont think they ought to be 
guaranteed theyre going to get one he said the purpose of 
the convention is to get the very best nominee for the democratic

new jersey gov thomas kean preacher of the 
republican partys politics of inclusion says he believes 
democratic leaders will do all they can to keep jesse jackson from 
getting the presidential nomination 
kean who is mentioned as a gop vice presidential possibility 
said he believes democratic super delegates would team to block 
jacksons nomination 
the super delegates are national state and local leaders 
allowed by party rules to remain uncommitted until the democrats 
convention which begins july 18 in atlanta 
kean speaking to reporters here said he believes jacksons 
candidacy would be opposed because party leaders believe a black 
cant win the white house and because of jacksons sometimes 
radical ideas 
they dont think he can win and they dont want him as 
president kean said 
kean said he believes jackson can capture enough delegates in 
upcoming new york new jersey and california primary elections to 
keep him in numerical competition with massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis the partys other possible presidential contender

democrat rose mofford who began her 
government career 47 years ago as a secretary was sworn in as 
arizonas first female governor saying shes proud of her new job 
but sad about how she got it 
mrs mofford 65 widely known as auntie rose commenced her 
term with wholesale housecleaning of the administration of evan 
mecham the elected republican governor convicted and removed from 
office monday by a senate court of impeachment 
she ordered mechams personal staff of about 20 off the payroll 
as of april 15 withdrew the names of 45 mecham appointees from 
senate consideration for now and said she would review agency 
chiefs to see who would stay 
mrs mofford who had been acting governor since feb 5 also 
promised to sign a tax increase a policy opposed by the mecham 
administration but did not know how large it would be 
i am relieved to have the acting qualifier removed from in 
front of the title of this office and i am moving forward with 
enthusiasm mrs mofford who became arizonas 18th governor 
told a news conference 
little did i realize 47 years ago that this would happen 
she told an invitationonly group of staff members in her protocol 
office earlier in the day 
mecham the first us governor in 59 years to lose his job 
through impeachment conviction told supporters tuesday he isnt 
ready to give up politics 
this is just another chapter in a book and this book isnt 
near the end he said i havent yet determined what my course 
will be 
also tuesday the arizona supreme court allowed a promecham 
group to drop its challenge to the may 17 gubernatorial recall 
election concerned arizona voters said it wanted to dismiss its 
case because it now sees the recall as the former governors last 
hope for regaining his office 
however mecham attorney jerris leonard said he does not believe 
mecham can run in any election until 1990 because the senate 
removed him from the fouryear term he began in january 1987 
the supreme court could decide this week whether a recall 
election is necessary since mecham was the target 
it is possible the election could remove mrs mofford from 
office her chief of staff andrew hurwitz said he had been 
negotiating with acting secretary of state karen osborne and 
attorney general bob corbin in hopes of exempting mrs mofford from 
the recall 
corbin believes the recall should be held as scheduled but mrs 
osborne a longtime mofford aide hopes to have it cancelled 
mrs mofford has refused to comment about the recall and a 
state resigntorun law could put her in jeopardy if she campaigns 
actively 
i have no idea she said when asked aboput her plans for the 
recall election the courts are going to have to decide it 
also uncertain was mechams ballot status 
mrs mofford said she hoped to decide shortly on which 
nominations to resubmit and which agency officials to keep most of 
the nominees can continue serving in the interim and are on 
relatively minor boards and commissions 
she also said she planned to travel to washington next week to 
lobby for arizona as the site of the superconducting super collider 
and to testify before congress on the central arizona project a 
giant canal system 
mrs mofford known throughout government for her silver beehive 
hairdo and her stories about her days as a champion softball 
player said she was proud to be the first woman in charge of the 
government where she has worked with 11 of the states 17 previous 
governors but added its very sad that i had to be elevated 
this way 
she has been the elected secretary of state for the last nine 
years and had been serving as acting governor since mecham was 
impeached by the state house in february arizona does not have a 
lieutenant governor

invigorated by victories in wisconsin and 
colorado democratic presidential contender michael dukakis today 
turned his attention to new york with its delegateheavy primary 
two weeks away 
dukakis told reporters late tuesday night that the results of 
the past two days give us a very very good boost in new yorks 
very very important primary 
the massachusetts governor had campaign appearances today in new 
york and in pennsylvania the new york primary is april 19 
pennsylvanias is a week later 
dukakis won comfortably in wisconsin and said the victory 
demonstrates his broad appeal 
we have done well with people all over wisconsin in all 
income and age groups in all parts of wisconsin he said 
dukakis key assets in new york appear to be money he has the 
most to spend possibly as much as 3 million and newfound 
momentum 
but the massachusetts governor said he placed little stock in 
the latter im not a great fan of the momentum theory of 
politics im a great fan of the marathon theory 
nor was he willing to say that new york with 255 delegates at 
stake offered him a chance to deliver a knockout punch to 
jesse jackson after his wisconsin and colorado wins this week 
this is going to be a 15round bout and it will be a 
decision he insisted theres no such thing as a knockout 
punch 
dukakis who declined to directly attack jackson in wisconsin 
appeared unlikely to do so in new york a state with a 
substantially larger black population 
im not going to spend an awful lot of time criticizing other 
people i think its very important that a strong and positive 
message be the message that people associate with mike dukakis 
he said 
dukakis was asked about the endorsement of gov mario cuomo 
reluctant to run for president himself but equally reluctant to 
anoint any other democrat 
id like to have it dukakis said he knows that but its 
his decision to make and ill respect whatever decision he makes 
its up to him 
he denied a published report that cuomo had made dukakis 
selection of jackson as his running mate a condition of an 
endorsement 
dukakis has a meeting set monday with an hasidic jewish leader 
bobover grand rebbe solomon halberstam of brooklyn about a quarter 
of new yorks voters are jewish 
dukakis wife kitty is jewish and she has noted in campaign 
visits here that she would be the first jewish first lady on 
monday she made a telephone call to a soviet jew who is trying to 
emigrate to the united states and later she talked to an audience 
on long island about her daughters first passover seder away from 
home and her own involvement in jewish issues 
various polls of new york democrats have dukakis leading with 
support ranging from 37 percent to 45 percent jackson has been 
consistently second at just under 30 percent and tennessee sen 
albert gore and sen paul simon of illinois have yet to crack 
double digits in any of the polls

holiday television viewers opted for a love 
story about british royalty over a tale of american immigrants 
starring sophia loren but part of the network audience simply 
tuned out 
easter sunday was a battle of the network movies with cbs 
handily winning over nbc that didnt keep nbc from winning the 
week though its fifth straight and 24th in the 30week season 
which ends in two weeks 
for the week that ended sunday nbc had an average rating of 
146 abc had 128 and cbs 126 according to the ac nielsen co 
the seasontodate averages are nbc 162 abc 138 cbs 135 cbs 
is finishing in last place in prime time for the first time ever 
the cbs evening news however continued in first place 
adding to the consternation of nbc which has seen nightly news 
fall from first to third in the threeway network news race this 
season 
in the most recent ratings the cbs evening news had a 
rating of 105 abcs world news tonight had a 103 and nbc 
nightly news 90 
the rating is a percentage of the nations 886 million 
households with televisions 
the toprated primetime shows of the week were the cosby 
show nbc with a 251 rating a different world nbc 
cheers nbc whos the boss abc golden girls nbc 
alf nbc the wonder years abc matlock nbc growing 
pains abc and addicted to his love abc 
the three networks lost viewers on easter sunday the 
threenetwork share or percentage of the viewing audience is an 
average 71 for the season on sunday it was 67 it was 69 for the 
week 
the woman he loved the story of king edward viiis 
abdication to marry american divorcee wallis warfield simpson won 
the night for cbs the movie starring jane seymour and anthony 
andrews had a rating of 145 and a 25 share and ranked 27th

by a news special the unruly dragon 
nbc launched the twopart the fortunate pilgrim starring 
sophia loren on sunday but it got a 131 and 22 share and ranked 
40th 
nbc attributed the low rating to the holiday and a poor start on 
the evening with a repeat of an andy williams special that was dead 
last in the network rankings 
that showing also contributed to the low rating for a repeat 
family ties a formerly top10 show that landed in the bottom 
10 last week 
saturdays ncaa basketball semifinals on cbs ranked 38th but 
apparently gave a boost to west 57th which had a 20 share and 
wasnt among the bottom 10 for a change nbc won the night with 
repeats

democrat jesse jackson says he is going on 
to new yorks big primary with momentum and a broadening base of 
white support despite falling short in wisconsin where he had 
hoped to claim an important second northern victory over michael 
dukakis 
im a longdistance runner jackson said tuesday trying to 
look beyond the disappointment of two loses to dukakis in two 
daysit is a 50state decathalon event 
im not inclined to pull the flower out of the vase after 
every race to see if the flowers still growing jackson said 
jackson lost to dukakis 47 percent to 28 percent in wisconsin 
a traditionally liberalvoting state where he had hoped to deal 
another blow to dukakis as he did in michigans caucuses a week and 
a half ago he also lost narrowly to dukakis in colorados caucuses 
both were states where expectations had been raised for jackson 
by his landslide victory in michigan his apparent growth in white 
voter support in michigan and connecticut last week and the huge 
enthusiastic crowds he had drawn in campaigning in both states 
in both states he had waged a populist campaign of appeal to the 
downtrodden and working people in an effort to forge a coalition of 
blacks whites and hispanics 
jackson continued to draw big crowds tuesday as he began his 
campaign toward arizonas caucuses on april 16 
he spoke to more than 7000 students in the domed stadium at 
northern arizona university in flagstaff where he also met with 
indian tribal leaders 
in his tempe speech jackson outlined in new specifics his plan 
for cutting 100 billion in annual deficits by the year 1993 he 
said he would freeze pentagon spending raising the top income tax 
rate from 28 percent to 385 percent and moving corporate taxes 
back toward 1970s levels as a percentage of gross national product 
jackson appeared with the former democratic presidential 
candidate and former arizona governor bruce babbitt at a large 
rally at arizona state university in tempe before some 8000 
people 
babbitt who dropped out of the race feb 18 praised jackson as 
having brought new fire into the hearts of the american people 
but stopped short of endorsing his candidacy 
jackson insisted there was no disappointment with his twin 
loses contending he had run good campaigns and clearly established 
a broader base among white voters 
we got to new york with a good campaign a broadbased 
campaign momentum a clear message a message that applies to new 
york he said 
jackson said he has finished first or second in 30 of 40 
delegate contests 
i feel good with the pace our momentum and our growth at 
this stage he said 
polling of voters leaving voting sites by television networks 
suggested jackson received a quarter or more of the white vote in 
wisconsin somewhat more than he received in connecticut and 
beyond what once had seemed a 10 percent barrier for his candidacy 
our white vote base continues to expand dramatically he 
said 
he said the wisconsin results show he has the broadest base of 
support among the democrats 
we went against the odds of machinery and money and culture 
and yet we see cultural expansion we see greater participation we 
see more white support and we come out of colorado and wisconsin 
with a total popular vote lead i have to feel good about 
that going into new york 
in all the primaries so far however dukakis leads by a slight 
margin in the popular vote with 3559364 to jacksons 3487843 
jackson continued to protest the slow count of caucus results in 
colorado and his criticism of the state party chairman there buie 
seawell who endorsed dukakis he said the slow count represents 
a sort of manipulation thats not good

the government will allow all prisoners 
freed from reeducation camps to resettle in the united states but 
only if they promise not to participate in future anticommunist 
activities a senior official said 
we are ready to let them go to the united states but these 
people when they go they must refrain from doing anything 
against vietnam nguyen dy nien a deputy foreign minister told 
us sen larry pressler 
nien on tuesday said there were no barriers in principle to the 
resettlement of the former prisoners but a us official must come 
to hanoi to negotiate the program he said only technical details 
need to be worked out 
nien did not specify how many vietnamese might be involved in 
the resettlement program 
pressler a south dakota republican arrived tuesday in vietnam 
to discuss the fate of 1767 americans missing in action from the 
vietnam war 
communist north vietnam defeated the usbacked government in 
south vietnam in april 1975 
us secretry of state george p shultz said in 1984 the united 
states would take all officals from the former saigon government 
held in the political reeducation camps established by the 
communists after they seized power 
since then vietnam appears to have wavered somewhat on its 
offer 
the pragmatic new administration of communist party seneral 
gecretary nguyen van linh as part of a national reconciliation 
policy has freed large numbers of the prisoners over the past 
year the last major release came during the lunar new year holiday 
in midfebruary 
but us officials say vietnam has allowed only a few of the 
former prisoners to leave the country 
the united states has been trying to resettle the former 
prisoners under its orderly departure program which allows 
vietnamese refugees and migrants to take regular commercial flights 
out of vietnam and resettle in the west

a federal judge and the fbi are at loggerheads 
over the agencys refusal to declassify seven files the judge has 
ruled as relevant to lyndon larouches claims of government 
infiltration and harassment 
assistant us attorney john markham said the fbi notified him 
tuesday afternoon that the agency did not want to declassify the 
files because they contain information about sensitive national 
security matters 
the agency reviewed the files following us district judge 
robert keetons ruling that material in them is relevant to defense 
claims that the fbi used a former larouche security consultant as 
an informant during the investigation that led to larouches july 
1987 indictment 
keeton who reviewed the files has not indicated what in them 
he considers relevant to the case markham said he would ask the 
judge at a hearing today to list the material in the files he 
considered relevant 
if judge rules the entire files should be given to defense 
lawyers or that the fbi should release portions it believes should 
be kept secret the government could ask the 1st us circuit court 
of appeals to overrule keeton 
testimony in the case has been halted four of the last five 
weeks because of battles over access to government records mostly 
files of vice president george bush the national security council 
the cia and the fbi the earliest testimony could resume is monday 
the seven classified fbi files were given to keeton last week 
during hearings on whether the fbi employed former larouche 
security consultant ryan quade emerson as an informant during the 
larouche investigation 
the fbi has said it used emerson very briefly during the 
investigation of the political extremist but the defense contends 
the agency is concealing emersons true role because he was used to 
entrap the defendants 
the defense raised the infiltration allegations during pretrial 
hearings more than a year ago but unsucessfully pursued the theory 
in court until gaining access a month ago to declassified documents 
that discuss apparent infiltration of larouche groups the 
declassified documents included a memo between former white house 
aide oliver north and another pivotal figure in the irancontra 
scandal 
larouche lawyers have accused markham of withholding the

the arabs who hijacked a kuwaiti jetliner 
to iran appear to be part of the iranianlinked network of 
terrorists that includes the shiite moslem extremists who hold 
americans hostage in lebanon 
the hijackers whose identity and nationality are not known 
have made the same demand as the americans captors freedom for 
17 proiranian extremists jailed in kuwait for bombing the us and 
french embassies there in 1983 
kuwait a tiny oilrich desert emirate trapped in the crossfire 
of the iraniraq war has doggedly refused to free any of them it 
reiterated tuesday that it will not bow to blackmail 
like terry anderson and thomas sutherland the two americans 
held captive in lebanon since 1985 the passengers and crew members 
held hostage aboard kuwait airways flight 422 have become pawns in 
a war between the acolytes of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and 
opponents of his islamic revolution 
kuwait like most of irans persian gulf arab neighbors is a 
conservative state ruled by sunni moslems historic rivals of the 
shiite sect who make up the vast majority of irans 50 million 
people 
like other arab states kuwait fears that irans fundamentalist 
islamic revolution will spread its way inciting its shiite 
minority into insurrection 
galvanized by israels 1982 invasion of lebanon and khomeinis 
revolution lebanons longdowntrodden shiites launched suicide 
bombings against the israelis and later us and french troops who 
took part in an illfated multinational peacekeeping force in 
lebanon 
in the past five years shiite extremists have particularly 
targeted kuwait which iran accuses of aiding iraq in the persian 
gulf war 
the 17 people whose release the hijackers demand were convicted 
of a wave of bombings in 1983 that killed five people and wounded 
86 and culminated in attacks on the us and french embassies in 
kuwait 
later terrorist attacks on kuwait included an abortive 1985 
assassination attempt on the emir sheik jaber alahmad alsabah 
three of the 17 were sentenced to death two iraqis baqer 
ibrahim abdelreda and hussein qassem hassan and a lebanese named 
as elias fuad saab 
the shiite kidnappers in lebanon are particularly interested in 
springing saab because he is a cousin of imad mugniyeh who western 
and lebanese intelligence believe to be the mastermind of islamic 
jihad or holy war and other extremist shiite factions behind a 
chain of suicide bombings kidnappings and aircraft hijackings in 
recent years 
saabs real name is mustafa youssef and western intelligence 
officials believe he rigged the bombs used in the kuwait attacks 
kuwait has so far not carried out the death sentences handed 
down on youssef and his fellow bombers apparently after appeals 
from washington 
but that appears to have been its only concession scores of 
other shiites have been arrested for sabotage since 1983 in 1985 
kuwaits nowsuspended parliament passed a law decreeing capital 
punishment for using explosives to kill or cause terror and life 
imprisonment for possessing explosives 
mugniyeh 36 is a key figure in the security apparatus of 
hezbollah or party of god an iranianbacked shiite movement 
believed to be the umbrella for factions holding most of the 22 
foreign hostages in lebanon 
his family has been closely linked for many years with the 
hamadis another shiite clan deeply involved in kidnappings 
both clans are from the bekaa valley in eastern lebanon 
mugniyeh and mohammed ali hamadi held in west germany on 
charges of smuggling explosives have been named by us 
authorities as two of the four lebanese shiites involved in the 
june 1985 hijacking of a twa airliner in which us navy diver 
robert dean stethem was killed 
the hamadis using various cover names allegedly kidnapped 
three west germans in beirut in an effort to force bonn to free 
mohammed and one of his brothers abbas who is currently on trial 
in duesseldorf for kidnapping two germans a third hamadi brother 
abdulhadi hamadi the linchpin of the clan is hezbollahs 
security chief 
the mugniyehs are thought to have kidnapped anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press seized march 
16 1985 anderson is the longest held of the missing foreigners

the fugitive leader of an august coup 
attempt promised to stage new attacks on the government but 
president corazon aquino today said mutineers lacked enough support 
to oust her 
a statement attributed to former lt col gregorio gringo 
honasan said his group promised last november to cease hostile acts 
against mrs aquino to give her time to fulfill promises to improve 
the government mrs aquino made the promises after honasans the 
aug 28 coup attempt 
we are now withdrawing that declaration said the statement 
from honasan 39 it has become obvious by its own actions that 
the aquino administration is incapable of ensuring the very 
survival of this nation over the next few years we have to act and 
act boldly 
the statement was distributed today to news organizations 
honasan escaped saturday from a prison ship in manila bay where he 
had been held since his arrest dec 9 military spokesman col 
oscar florendo said troops had found no trace of honasan despite a 
nationwide search 
mrs aquino today told reporters her government had taken steps 
to correct problems raised by honasan during his abortive coup 
attempt in which at least 53 people were killed and hundreds 
wounded 
i think he will have to admit that the government had 
adequately answered already the legitimate grievances and i think 
the filipino people definitely will go against honasan mrs 
aquino said he will not be able to get any support 
honasans complaints included low military pay and lack of an 
effective strategy against communist rebels the coup attempt was 
the most serious of six major bids to topple mrs aquino since she 
took office on feb 25 1986 
defense secretary fidel v ramos described the honasan statement 
as a call to violence and said the author must have a 
distorted sense of values ramos said he had ordered the military 
to verify its authenticity 
the letter as you know threatens not only the government but 
the entire society ramos told reporters i am very sure that 
our people will reject such an undertaking by anyone 
national security adviser emmanuel soriano also doubted honasan 
could mount a serious coup attempt but said the government was in a 
state of watchful waiting mrs aquino plans to go ahead with a 
visit next week to china and hong kong 
in his statement honasan said he and others jailed in previous 
coup attempts had been detained for months without formal charges 
or trial 
he claimed the government was more concerned about protecting 
the rights of jailed members of the communist party of the 
philippines and its armed wing the new peoples army rather than 
those of its own soldiers 
apparently this administration has no intention of effecting 
genuine reconciliation in our fragmented society because of its 
inordinate fear of losing power to people whose only vision is to 
set a new direction toward good government and a reformed 
military he said 
to this day after seven months many officers and men 
implicated in the august 28 incident are still detained without 
charges and without trial 
their right to due process and speedy trial were completely 
disregarded by the aquino administration despite its pretensions of 
being democratic and just while affording the same rights to 
captured communist guerrillas

negotiable instruments

fatal attraction nominated for an 
academy award as best film will not win any prizes from this 
quiet suburban hamlet 
in fact the ruckus that accompanied the movies filming here 
prompted the town board to approve an ordinance tuesday tightening 
restrictions on moviemaking 
board members voted 32 to make film crews appear before the 
board to obtain a permit whether the filming is on private or 
public land 
town supervisor larry dwyer said the community is often used for 
films and television commercials but fatal attraction caused 
too many problems he said the film crew blocked roads when school 
buses were trying to get by annoyed townspeople with bright lights 
for night filming and rented private property for commercial use 
no matter what urging we gave no matter what cooperation we 
asked there was continued abuse dwyer said

more than 200 photographs of bound 
tortured men were found in the bedroom of a man whose house and 
yard yielded skulls and bone fragments after his arrest on assault 
and sodomy charges police said 
robert a berdellas 500000 bond was revoked tuesday at a 
court hearing in which a police officer said one man photographed 
bound and hanging from his ankles in berdellas basement appeared 
to be dead 
berdella 39 was arrested saturday after a 22yearold man 
wearing only a dog collar told police saturday he had escaped from 
bardellas home after four days of torture and sexual assault 
bardella was charged with seven counts of forcible sodomy and 
one count each of felonious restraint and firstdegree assault 
authorities have searched berdellas house and yard since his 
arrest after the man apparently escaped from berdellas 
threestory house by jumping from a secondstory window and asked a 
neighbor to call police 
michael calderon a neighbor said berdella told him about five 
years ago he was using his home as a halfway house for runaways and 
that young men often visited the house 
i thought he was a father figure to those kids and i got 
adjusted to the fact that there were boys at his house said 
calderon 
berdella also organized a neighborhood watch program after 
moving into the house on charlotte street in a lowermiddle class 
section of midtown kansas city about 16 years ago 
he led us to believe he was a nice guy a leader in the 
community calderon said he was very active and made us feel 
like secondclass residents because we were not active 
on tuesday investigators using shovels and a backhoe found 
small bone fragments in berdellas back yard but police did not 
know whether they were human bones 
two skulls one of which appears to be a relic were found 
inside berdellas home saturday a third was discovered buried in 
berdellas back yard on sunday all are thought to be human 
the buried skull still had hair and what appeared to be 
deteriorating flesh on it and in the earth around it according to 
evidence in the hearing before associate circuit judge charles l 
stitt 
a kansas state university forensic anthropologist told police 
the skull had been buried for no more than a year and probably was 
buried about three months ago 
police found the photographs in a bedroom dresser near a room 
where the 22yearold man was believed held captive detective 
ashley hurn said during the hearing 
according to court records the mans clothing and pieces of 
rope bindings he said he had burned with matches to escape were 
still in the room when police searched the house 
police also reported finding torture and bondage devices which 
they refused to describe 
when police first entered the house saturday they found freshly 
poured concrete in the basement but drilled through the concrete 
on sunday and found nothing suspicious 
police also found files in the house that contained information 
from newspaper articles about the disappearance of gerald d 
howell 19 who has been missing since 1984 hurn said 
howells father paul howell has contended for several years 
that berdella was responsible for the disappearance when berdella 
appeared for a court hearing monday howell lunged at him and had 
to be restrained by police 
police have confirmed that they are examining berdellas 
possessions for possible links to the unsolved disappearances of 
howell and others

three of the 30 kuwaitis aboard the kuwait airways 
jumbo jet hijacked to iran are named alsabah indicating they are 
among the estimated 1200 people who belong to the persian gulf 
states royal family 
the airline identified the three who were in the firstclass 
section as fadel khaled alsabah a man and two women ebtesam 
and anware khaled alsabah the two women have been identified as 
sisters of fadel 
like all other male members of the royal clan fadel can carry 
the title of sheik sources in kuwait who spoke on condition of 
anonymity on tuesday said fadel is a businessman and distant 
relative of the royal family 
the alsabah dynasty has ruled kuwait for more than two 
centuries and oversees vast oil wealth that gives it one of the 
worlds highest per capita incomes 
the riches that began to flow from the discovery of oil were 
used in the 1970s to set up a modern welfare state kuwait until 
recently also boasted the only elected parliament in the region 
but since 1980 kuwait and its royal family have been plagued by 
terrorism blamed on iranian fundamentalists who have pledged to 
spread their revolution throughout the persian gulf states 
the emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah survived an 
assassination attempt in may 1985 by a suicide driver who tried to 
crash a bombladen car into the royal motorcade 
sheik jaber escaped with minor wounds but two security men and 
two pedestrians were killed along with the bomber 
the terrorist attacks have included bombings and the hijacking 
of a kuwait airways jetliner in 1984 
in that incident two american passengers were slain by the 
hijackers who demanded freedom for 17 proiranian extremists 
imprisoned in kuwait for bombing the us and french embassies and 
other targets in kuwait in 1983 
the arabs who hijacked the kuwaiti airliner tuesday made the 
same demand 
the fundamentalist islamic rulers of iran who have been at war 
with iraq for 7 years accuse kuwait of aiding iraq 
members of the alsabah clan fill most senior posts in the 
government the army the police and both the private and public 
sectors of the emirate which has a population of 17 million 
they include the crown prince and prime minister sheik saad 
alabdullah alsalem alsabah and the ministers of defense 
interior foreign affairs and information 
even the hijacked plane is named after the ruler and has the 
word aljaberiya arabic for the plane of the aljabers 
emblazoned on its side

us military guards today reclaimed 27 
remains believed to be those of americans killed in the vietnam war 
the largest such repatriation since 1973 
the us military team saluted as the remains each in a metal 
case topped with a folded american flag were loaded one by one 
onto a us air force cargo plane for a flight to army laboratories 
in hawaii the brief solemn ceremony was held under overcast skies 
vietnam also returned three other remains they identified as 
those of ethnic asians but who could be missing americans 
it was the largest such transfer of remains since the last 
american forces withdrew from south vietnam on march 29 1973 
opening the way for the communist victory in april 1975 three 
million americans served in vietnam and 58000 died 
also today vietnamese officials angrily rejected charges that 
hanoi was dragging its feet on accounting for 1767 americans who 
remain listed as missing in action in the war vietnam has 
threatened to end its cooperation in repatriating other american 
remains if washington maintains its criticisms 
in a meeting today with visiting us sen larry pressler 
rsd foreign minister nguyen co thach responded heatedly to a 
recent pentagon suggestion that the communists have been storing 
remains and returning them little by little said an american 
negotiator requesting anonymity 
the head of vietnams accounting office for missing in action 
nguyen can had dismissed the charge as nonsense the day 
before the next time they make such a statement we will have to 
reconsider whether we will do the job this shows there is no 
goodwill on the part of the us 
at todays ceremony two dozen peasants in bamboo hats and other 
bystanders with bicycles squatted in an adjacent field to watch as 
the remains were turned over at hanois noi bai airport 
pressler joined the team from the us joint casualty resolution 
center in saluting as the us army guard placed the caskets into 
the belly of the c141 plane 
lt col paul mather head of the us casualty team said the 
vietnamese provided a list of names for at least half of the 27 
remains some of those names are on the official us list he 
said most caskets contained many sizable pieces of bone he said 
some of the remains were reportedly found near hanoi suggesting 
they are those of airmen shot down during intense us bombing runs 
in the heartland of communist north vietnam the united states has 
made such cases a priority because it says those remains are most 
likely to be located 
the united states and vietnam which have no diplomatic ties 
frequently have bickered over the issue of remains and hanoi thus 
far has returned 152 remains that the us army has confirmed as 
those of americans missing in action the previous largest transfer 
was aug 14 1985 and involved 26 remains at least 24 of which 
were positively identified as americans 
this being the largest we hope it means increased 
collaboration us pacific command spokeswoman maj virginia 
byla said today however she agreed with other us officials that 
vietnam has more information about remains than it has divulged 
pressler said he told thach many americans believe vietnam was 
not forthcoming on the issue and may even still be holding american 
prisoners of war he said thach responded that if any us 
congressmen had evidence of such prisoners the foreign minister 
would personally accompany him in a helicopter to investigate 
after this trip im more convinced that they are making a 
full faith effort to close this chapter but its not closed in the 
minds of many americans said pressler a vietnam war veteran 
it was the fourth return of remains since vietnam agreed in 
august talks with us presidential envoy john w vessey to resume 
repatriation efforts after months of deadlock 
but vietnams deputy foreign minister mguyen dy nien on 
tuesday charged that washington had failed to carry out its part of 
the agreement he said vietnam was awaiting direct us aid for 
postwar reconstruction 
if it wants a full accounting of its missing washington must 
demonstrate its concern its direct commitment he told 
pressler

secretary of state george p shultz flew to 
egypt after a final and apparently unsuccessful meeting today with 
israels prime minister he declared that his middle east peace 
initiative nevertheless was intact and alive 
the stop in cairo primarily was a courtesy call on president 
hosni mubarak who played a leading role in shaping shultzs 
proposal for arabisraeli negotiations and is the only regional 
leader to endorse it 
mubarak has insisted however on a direct role in the talks for 
the plo which shultz has ruled out 
in a statement to reporters moments before he left israel for 
egypt shultz said he made some progress but the differences 
havent been substantially narrowed 
theres no masking the deepseated obstacles to peace 
shultz said at ben gurion airport emotions are deeply felt 
principles are proudly held great traditions cultures and rights 
are involved but with a serious commitment to work it can 
happen 
shultz made an emotional appeal to israeli and arab leaders to 
say yes to his peace initiative which he pledged to continue 
despite the difficulties 
the initiative we have discussed so intensively and thoroughly 
over these past weeks is intact and alive he said its 
integrity strength and balance and fairness are evident and 
unchanged it is there for the taking 
after talks with mubarak shultz was scheduled to travel to 
amman jordan to continue talks with king hussein his middle east 
trip will also take him to saudi arabia 
shultz expressed satisfaction with his talks with hussein who 
he said posed many questions about the american plan thus 
indicating a serious engagement in the search for peace 
earlier today shultz held final meetings with israeli foreign 
minister shimon peres and israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
when you are down in the trenches doing it you certainly are 
aware of how hard it is shultz said after seeing shamir but 
that doesnt lessen the importance of continuing the effort 
shultz returned to israel tuesday night from a 15hour trip to 
jordan and syria where he sounded out arab leaders on the peace 
plan 
shamir aide avi pazner said shultz told shamir he had not 
received a clear answer to his peace plan from hussein who 
requested clarifications from the israelis pazner quoted shultz as 
saying president hafez assad of syria was negative about the 
plan 
shamir said shultz would not return to jerusalem on his current 
shuttle but israel radio quoted foreign ministry officials as 
saying they did not rule out the possibilty of shultzs returning 
saturday if he has something to discuss 
returning from jordan and syria on tuesday shultz said i 
cannot report any particular sense of convergence on our initiative 
at this point but he said all sides had urged him to continue 
the us initiative calls for negotiations in two stages the 
first would seek to establish some selfrule for palestinians who 
live in the israeli occupied west bank and gaza strip the second 
would deal with the settlement of the 40year arabisraeli conflict 
four months of antioccupation rioting in the occupied lands 
have left more than 135 palestinians and one israeli soldier dead 
israel seized the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
in an interview in amman on tuesday with a group of jordanian 
editors shultz said a total israeli withdrawal from the west bank 
was not in the cards 
he opposed a separate role in the negotiations for the palestine 
liberation organization which he said called in its covenant for 
israels extermination and he said an independent palestinian 
state on the west bank would not be viable economically and did not 
make sense 
shultz said the ethnic aspirations of palestinians should be 
taken into account we seek some workable way these interests can 
be served 
at the same time he said negotations must be based on un 
security council resolutions that call on israel to yield territory 
captured in the 1967 war in exchange for peace 
without explanation the interview was not shown on jordanian 
television tuesday night 
shultz said tuesday that both shamir and peres were prepared to 
hold negotiations with jordan on an overall settlement 
but there are all sorts of questions shultz said 
especially on how negotiations on palestinian selfrule would be 
linked to dealing with an overall settlement 
i dont want to give any big plus sign because that would not 
be warranted by the facts shultz said 
damascus radio said assad made four demands in connection with a 
peace settlement including complete israeli withdrawal from the 
occupied lands and establishment of a palestinian state

former us sen paul laxalt says an award 
of nearly 650000 in legal costs makes him the victor in a more 
than fouryear libel battle against mcclatchy newspapers 
the public knows well that winners arent ordered to fork over 
hundreds of thousands of dollars and no amount of distortion by 
the bee newspaper regarding todays decision will dispel that 
basic fact laxalt said in a statement issued in washington 
this should prove that it is not impossible for a public 
servant to win the good fight against a wealthy and powerful 
newspaper chain 
the award announced monday marks the end of a protracted legal 
battle that began in november 1983 when the bee newspapers in 
sacramento modesto and fresno published an article about the 
family of laxalt a longtime confidante of president reagan and 
then a republican senator from nevada 
the article alleged that the internal revenue service had 
evidence of skimming at the ormsby house hotelcasino in carson 
city nev while the laxalt family owned it in the early 1970s 
the action was dropped in june 1987 and the two sides then 
entered arbitration over fees with laxalts side requesting 
approximately 43 million in fees and costs the threemember 
panel griffin b bell charles b renfrew and philip w tone 
entered their award last thursday for 647454 in fees and costs 
which will be paid by mcclatchys insurance carrier 
the award also provides that 130363 in fees and expenses for 
the arbitrators will be shared by both parties 
mcclatchy newspapers said in a statement it would have preferred 
its insurance company not pay any of the fees but called the award 
fair to all parties 
we are pleased that this long legal battle is finally over 
but lets hope its lessons are not forgotten the publishing 
company said in a statement the first amendment is meaningless 
without a strong independent and vigilant press willing to stand 
up for its beliefs 
its a hell of a victory said attorney james beasley who 
represented laxalt thats over half a million in counsel fees 
that laxalt doesnt have to pay you only pay counsel fees to the 
winner 
the laxalt libel defense fund already has paid 680000 in legal 
fees related to the case according to laxalts daughter michelle 
who runs a political consulting firm in washington dc mcclatchy 
newspapers is not required to pay reimbursement for those costs

two men fled from a laundry after their 
gasolinesoaked clothes caused an explosion in a washing machine 
and the laundry managers hair was singed when the machine exploded 
again while he tried to drain it 
they probably just didnt know any better it was just a 
stupid thing to do said charles g lloyd manager of white star 
laundry amp cleaners 
he said the garments appeared to be those of painters he said 
the men may have used gasoline to remove paint from the clothes 
before washing them and he doesnt think they meant to endanger 
anybody 
lloyd said he was sitting in his office monday when he heard a 
boom and he saw two men running out the door one of them with 
singed hair he said five to 10 people were washing their clothes 
at the time in the coinoperated laundry 
i assumed the guy had been hurt i didnt think they were 
running away lloyd said 
then lloyd found that the five machines the men had been using 
reeked of gasoline 
i opened the lid and you could smell the fumes lloyd said 
you could see the gasoline floating on top of the water 
a few minutes later lloyd was trying to drain the water from 
the machines when fumes from the machine he was standing in front 
of ignited 
it singed my eyebrows and hair ive got some blisters on my 
cheeks he said several machines were damaged and the laundrys 
front window shattered lloyd said 
fire investigator jc wilson said investigators are looking for 
the man who loaded the clothes just to make sure he isnt hurt and 
to warn him of the danger of gasoline 
but im pretty sure he knows now wilson said

tehran during this mornings rush hour and iran said 16 people 
were killed earlier iraqi warplanes blasted a supertanker near an 
iranian oil complex in the persian gulf 
tehrans official islamic republic news agency said six children 
were among those killed when four rockets hit irans capital at the 
same time it said many others were wounded and that a hospital 
and nursery school were hit 
irna monitored in nicosia said 15 other civilians were killed 
in iraqi air raids on six towns in the southeasetern khuzestan 
province 
the official iraqi news agency said four missiles were fired 
into tehran the nest of hypocrites and charlatans at 929 
am 129 am edt 
it was one of the heaviest single barrages on the iranian 
capital since the socalled war of the cities was rekindled 
feb 29 since then iraq has been pounding the iranian capital 
with missiles usually firing only one or two at a time 
the iraqi agency said basra and the umm qasr port cities were 
hit with missiles and artillery during the night it said one 
missile hit an elementary school in umm qasr killing three 
students and wounding 50 other children and teachers

cut off the criminal iranian regimes oil supplies iran depends 
on a tanker fleet to shuttle its oil through the gulf under the 
threat of iraqi attacks 
iraq has safer outlets for its oil exports which both countries 
badly need to finance their costly war now 7 years old iraqi oil

own states 
we are also soliciting a coalition of other groups to 
participate carter said

requiring the confederate flag be flown over the capitol but said 
the flagpole will remain empty until the legislature tells him 
which of three flags used by the confederacy from 1861 to 1865 they 
want 
black legislators had opposed the resolution saying the 
confederate flag was a symbol of racism and slavery and had been 
used by groups such as the ku klux klan 
they fly it were marching carter said 
the flag has sparked controversy in several other southern 
states recently in georgia legislators have introduced a bill to 
redesign the state flag which incorporates the design of the

michael dukakis calling his overwhelming 
wisconsin victory over jesse jackson a sign that voters think he 
has the strength and the experience to be president said today 
another win in new yorks primary could clear his path to the 
democratic nomination 
jackson insisted that despite twin losses to dukakis in 
wisconsin and colorado at this stage of the campaign i feel very 
good 
the massachusetts governor won his first midwestern primary on 
the strength of the bluecollar vote tuesday helping to ease 
doubts about his appeal even as it was raising questions about 
jacksons ability to turn his enthusiastic crowds into success at 
the polls 
wisconsin also rang the closing bell for paul simons campaign 
giving the illinois senator a lastplace finish simon was at home 
today in washington to reassess his campaign and aides said he 
would make a statement thursday 
sen albert gore jr spent heavily but remained an alsoran in 
third place just as simon did here gore has put all his chips on 
the new york primary on april 19 
in atlanta today party chief paul kirk was asked if he felt 
relief that dukakis had won and set aside at least temporarily the 
question of a jackson ticket in the fall not relief kirk 
replied i was impressed with the results of the dukakis 
campaign 
kirk said jackson enjoyed heavy media coverage after his win in 
michigan and dukakis had shown toughness to stick to the issues 
the people looked at us and made a decision as to who they 
thought had the strength and the experience and the values to lead 
this country fortunately i was on top dukakis said on 
nbctvs today show i hope i can do the same in new york i 
believe i can and go on and win the nomination 
jackson who appeared on cbs this morning congratulated 
dukakis for running a good effective campaign in wisconsin 
but noted his own strong showings to date 
of 40 contests that have been run now ive come in no 1 or 
no 2 in 30 of them and i have 250000plus popular vote lead and 
so at this stage of the campaign i feel very good 
the new york contest puts the spotlight on gov mario cuomo who 
has often been mentioned as a potential draft at a deadlocked 
convention but dukakis win is likely to tone down talk of 
drafting cuomo or another democrat 
the new york governor has not made an endorsement but the 
dukakis camp is hoping the wisconsin win could put dukakis in a 
good position to finally win the nod from his fellow governor 
there was a republican primary in wisconsin but there were no 
doubts vice president george bush the nomination his in 
everything but name bested pat robertson by a 101 margin 
in the democratic battle wisconsin gave dukakis the boost he 
had to have and perhaps pointed to a ceiling on jacksons support 
i hope its a sign of things to come said dukakis of what 
he called a great victory 
with 99 percent of the precincts reporting dukakis had 481857 
or 48 percent to 285575 or 28 percent for jackson gore had 
176009 for 17 pecent while simon drew only 48877 about 5 percent 
dukakis edged jackson among bluecollar workers network exit 
polls said and won white union workers outright that was good 
news for the massachusetts governor who needed to show he can win 
that group which is key to the partys hopes in the fall 
even in kenosha county home of the doomed chrysler plant where 
jackson had made a splash by joining the picket line dukakis won 
with better than a 21 margin 
im doing very well with working families because people 
see in me someone who doesnt just talk about jobs dukakis said 
the massachusetts governor also won in colorados precinct 
caucuses which were held monday even though the counting dragged 
into tuesday 
with 77 percent counted dukakis won with 44 percent to 
jacksons 37 percent uncommitted groups took 16 percent and gore 3 
percent 
in the republican caucuses in colorado bush won easily over 
robertson 
dukakiss campaign was in serious trouble after jacksons 
stunning victory in the march 26 caucuses but he has now won three 
of four events in the past eight days adding wisconsin and 
colorado to his connecticut primary win jackson won the virgin 
islands caucuses over the weekend 
this is going to be a 15round bout and it will be by a 
decision theres no such thing as a knockout punch dukakis 
said 
the delegate numbers showed why the democratic race could 
continue to drag on dukakis moved ahead but the partys rules 
splitting the delegates up among the top finishers kept jackson 
close 
despite his victory margin dukakis picked up on 43 delegates in 
wisconsin to 26 for jackson gore won 12 
in colorado dukakis picked up 21 national convention delegates 
and jackson 17 the other seven are uncommitted 
that plus partial wisconsin results left the ap delegate count 
this way dukakis 73555 jacksn 70655 gore 3948 simon 1705 
and uncommitted 5166 a total of 2082 votes are need to win at 
the democratic national convention in atlanta 
tuesdays results give dukakis the momentum going into the new 
york primary where 255 delegates are stake in the biggest single 
state thus far then comes the pennsylvania primary where the 
rules could allow dukakis to win the lions share of the delegates 
on april 26 
perhaps equally important his victories this week give dukakis 
new stronger arguments to make to the senators and representatives 
who will be chosen as super delegates the same week as the new york 
primary 
with the pledged delegate count still close the verdict of the 
unpledged super delegates governors democratic national 
committee members and members of congress could provide the 
numbers to give dukakis a majority 
jackson vowed to press on im a long distance runner he 
said

a judge held ac nielsen co in contempt of 
court today and fined the television rating company 500 a day for 
failing to turn over ratings of atlanta newscasts sought by 
attorneys in a murder retrial 
attorneys for wayne carl coleman had sought the ratings 
information as a basis for motions to delay or move colemans 
retrial for the 1973 slayings of six members of the alday family in 
southwest georgias seminole county 
defense attorney tom west said he wants to use the ratings of 
local television news programs to show how widely the alday case 
has been publicized in dekalb county 
jury selection began monday for the retrial which was moved 
from seminole county to dekalb county in suburban atlanta 
superior court judge hugh lawson ruled nielsen in willful 
contempt of court and said he was concerned that its refusal to 
produce the information would cause real problems in the 
prosecution of this case 
nielsen attorney bernard rosenthal told lawson the chicagobased 
company regretted not being able to produce the material but said 
complying with the subpoena would disrupt nielsens business by 
making it compile information that is not already available 
he also said it would present a continual threat of requests in 
similar trials 
rosenthal said nielsen would appeal immediately to the georgia 
supreme court 
coleman was one of three maryland prison escapees convicted of 
murder and sentenced to death in seminole county for the slayings 
of ned alday his brother his three sons and his daughterinlaw 
in 1985 a federal appeals court threw out the convictions of 
coleman his halfbrother carl isaacs and george elder dungee on 
grounds that pretrial publicity made a fair trial impossible in 
seminole county 
isaacs was retried in houston county earlier this year and was 
again convicted and sentenced to death dungee is to be tried later 
in muscogee county 
lawson is presiding at all three trials

the highestranking east german official to 
visit the united states will hold talks with secretary of state 
george p shultz next month an east german diplomat said today 
hermann axen member of the politburo and party central 
committee with responsibility for foreign affairs was invited to 
give a lecture at the johnshopkins university institute for 
contemporary german studies on may 4 and will meet shultz the day 
before 
axen will speak to the national press club and meet members of 
congress 
the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1974 but 
relations have remained cool because us officials regard 
communist east germany as one of the soviet unions staunchest 
allies and have found the country among the least responsive to 
us pleas to improve human rights conditions 
deputy secretary of state john c whitehead who met east german 
leaders in berlin last year was the highestranking american 
official to visit east germany 
the main intention of these talks will be to promote the 
relationship between both countries and contribute to a further 
buildup of the relationship said the east german diplomat 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
he said axen would spend a brief time in new york during the 
trip

a federal judge denied a request by 
jurors for a trial transcript telling them to rely on memory and 
notes while deliberating in the case of 13 white supremacists 
including nine accused of sedition 
deliberations were delayed today because one of the jurors has a 
sick child us district judge morris arnold said juror harold c 
whittenburg went to a hospital to see about his baby and that the 
third day of deliberations was postponed until he could rejoin the 
jury 
nine defendants are charged with conspiring to overthrow the 
government by violence and one of them along with four other 
defendants is charged with conspiring to kill a federal judge and 
an fbi agent two of the sedition defendants are accused of the 
interstate transportation of stolen money 
in denying three jurors requestion for the transcript tuesday 
arnold said the document would be 7000 pages long and would not be 
ready for three or four months he also denied their request to 
rehear lengthy portions of testimony 
the government called 113 witnesses and the defense had 79 in 
the trial which began feb 16 
the case went to the jury monday afternoon and lawyers 
defendants and others waited at the federal courthouse on tuesday 
one defendant bruce carroll pierce is serving a 150year 
sentence for violating the civil rights of denver radio talk show 
host alan berg by killing him and 100 years on a seattle 
conviction for racketeering 
defendant robert e miles free on 50000 bond said he would 
have attended the trial even if he were not a defendant i 
wouldnt have missed it for the world he said this is where 
the devil is this is evil personified the whole crew 
defendant richard g butler said the trial is a move by the 
government to snuff out views that do not meet government approval 
he said he expects to be acquitted but in any case they win 
they break us financially 
butler miles and louis ray beam jr who also is on trial and 
is being held without bond are considered three of the top leaders 
of the whitesupremacist movement in the united states 
but one of beams lawyers kirk lyons of houston said butler 
beam and miles are through fighting miles is 63 butler is 70 
beam has got a 20yearold wife 
acquittal would slow the movement lyons said because it would 
show that white supremacists can get a fair trial in american 
courts 
the sedition defendants face up to 20 years in prison and a 
20000 fine if convicted the murder charge carries a maximum of 
life imprisonment and the interstate transportation charges have a 
maximum term of 10 years and a 10000 fine 
the government also contends that some of the defendants 
committed a series of robberies to finance their activities the 
robberies netted about 41 million of which about 1 million is 
unaccounted for the government said 
the key government witness james ellison testified that the 
white supremacist group he led in arkansas carried out bombings to 
advance a conspiracy begun in july 1983 at hayden lake idaho at 
an aryan nations conference 
ellison is serving a 20year prison sentence defendants who 
attended the 1983 meeting have said that there was no conspiracy 
and that ellison has made up the story in hopes of getting a 
sentence reduction

attorney general edwin meese iii is trying to 
fill a key justice department post left vacant by a protest 
resignation after settling for his second choice for the 
departments no 2 post 
meese announced tuesday that he is recommending former american 
bar association president john c shepherd for the no 2 job he 
also said he has chosen treasury department enforcement chief 
francis a keating for the departments no 3 position which had 
opened before six protest resignations rocked the department last 
week 
still unfilled is the job of head of the departments criminal 
division 
the choices announced tuesday drew support from the ranking 
republican on the senate judiciary committee sen strom thurmond 
of south carolina last week had conveyed congressional concern to 
meese over problems at the justice department in the wake of the 
protest resignations by deputy attorney general arnold burns 
assistant attorney general william weld of the criminal division 
and four of their aides 
meese said he had notified several members of congress about his 
choices ahead of time but thurmond a member of the committee that 
will hold confirmation hearings on shepherd and keating pointedly 
stated that meese had not advised him in advance 
burns and weld resigned out of concern that the nearly 11month 
criminal investigation of meese by independent counsel james c 
mckay was hurting the departments operations and image 
shepherd was meeses second choice to replace burns after 
former federal appeals judge arlin adams of philadelphia turned it 
down citing a heavy private caseload 
keating a former fbi agent would fill the post vacated by 
associate attorney general stephen trott who is leaving the 
department to become a federal appeals court judge 
thurmond said of shepherd and keating from what i now know 
about these two fine individuals i look forward to supporting 
their confirmation 
meese said he probably will announce a recommended replacement 
for weld after returning from a weeklong trip to south america to 
discuss drugs with officials in several countries 
a justice department source said salvatore r martoche now an 
assistant secretary in the labor department had rejected a request 
from meese to take welds job assistant attorney general in charge 
of the criminal division 
martoche decided not to take the job because of the taint 
factor relating to the continuing criminal investigation of 
meese said the source speaking on condition of anonymity 
meese declined to say whether he had offered martoche the job 
but said he had spoken to a number of people about it 
keating was asked whether he had had second thoughts about 
accepting his appointment 
certainly the events of last week made me as a professional 
pause he said but i have every confidence in the leadership 
of the department and the attorney general i think with our new 
team here the operation of the department will continue 
shepherd said he had no reservations about taking the job in the 
wake of burns protest resignation but shepherd did acknowledge 
meeses continuing legal problems saying we all see that 
the white house allowed meese to proceed with the replacements 
despite a lack of completed fbi background checks the move was an 
attempt to quell questions about meeses ability to lead the 
department effectively in the aftermath of the burnsweld 
resignations 
shepherd and keating will begin serving shortly on an acting 
basis until after their nomination by president reagan and senate 
confirmation burns and trott will stay on while meese is in south 
america 
such nominations normally are announced by the president but 
meese was allowed to announce them at a justice department news 
conference after checking with white house chief of staff howard 
baker 
shepherd who is 62 was aba president in 198485 and is a 
partner in a st louis law firm meese said he will be a highly 
distinguished and most welcome addition to the justice department 
meese said keating 44 the assistant treasury secretary for 
enforcement can hit the ground running in the justice 
departments work combating illegal drugs

a dispute between transplant specialists and 
anesthesiologists at childrens hospital has resulted in boycotts 
of meetings and other conflicts says an official of a transplant 
oversight committee 
the very rev george werner vice chairman of the committee 
said tuesday that the panel probably will discuss the controversy 
at its april 14 meeting 
werner began investigating dissension at the hospital after 
several internal memos criticizing its liver transplant program 
were disclosed late last month the memos were released by maria 
desillers a miami woman who is being sued by the hospital for not 
paying her late sons medical bills 
it is obvious that an institution which has internal memos 
getting out on the street and personality clashes being made public 
needs to look at its administration werner said 
mrs desillers said she released the memos in hopes of spurring 
a federal investigation of the hospitals liver transplant program 
her 7yearold son ronnie died last year after three liver 
transplants 
ms desillers has refused to pay the 261189 still owed the 
hospital saying her son received negligent care 
the boys plight generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
donations from sympathetic americans including president reagan 
florida officials are investigating ms desillers handling of the 
money 
the memos some of which were written by dr d ryan cook an 
anesthesiologist spoke of confusion in the hospitals liver 
transplant program he also referred to growing distrust 
disillusionment and negativism 
recently we had two current transplants in which the donor 
organs were switched about like peas under shells until no one 
could easily recall which liver was to go into which patient 
cook wrote in a feb 2 letter to dr william donaldson the 
hospitals medical director 
werner said both patients are doing well 
dr cook is using exciting language but he really didnt look 
at the results werner said it seems that whoever moved on 
this case did a good job 
mortality rates for pediatric liver transplants are excellent 
werner said as of two weeks ago 44 of 49 patients operated on 
since august have survived he said 
werner said however that the transplant surgeons who work 
under the direction of transplant pioneer dr thomas e starzl 
occasionally act like cowboys in the hospital bureaucracy the 
surgeons sometimes ignore surgical schedules and expect 
anesthesiologists to show up on short notice he said 
werner chided the anesthesiologists for not attending the weekly 
liver transplant reviews when hospital staff members assign 
priorities to the list of patients awaiting transplants 
there didnt seem to be a chain of command so that the 
anesthesiologists and transplant surgeons knew what was happening 
with the scheduling and with the reviews werner said 
what needs to be emphasized here is that this is a good 
program and what dr cook will tell you im sure is that he 
wants to make a good program better werner said

the government today told 
international relief agencies to recall all their foreign workers 
from the wartorn northern regions of tigray and eritrea for 
security reasons a un official said 
the request was made in a twopage statement distributed to 
relief agencies in addis ababa the capital by the relief and 
rehabilitation commission the government agency responsible for 
drought and famine relief in ethiopia 
the rrc notified relief agencies operating to recall to addis 
ababa their expatriate staff to avoid personnel security risks 
said david morton head of the world food program in ethiopia 
donor agencies are advised to turn over their operations to the 
rrc to guarantee the continuity of relief activities 
the order comes a week after president mengistu haile mariam 
told ethiopians in a radio address that government troops were 
facing a grim struggle against rebels in eritrea and tigray 
mengistu said the government was mobilizing troops to crush the 
longtime rebellions and appealed to his countrymen to give 
everything to the warfront 
rebels have been fighting for 27 years in eritrea africas 
longest civil war and for 14 years in tigray the fighting has 
disrupted relief efforts in both regions where crop failures 
threaten 35 million people with starvation 
morton said the statement did not give a deadline for withdrawal 
of foreigners from the northern regions and the order did not apply 
to ethiopians working with the international agencies 
the number of foreign relief workers affected by the order was 
not immediately known 
there are about 60 nongovernmental relief organizations working 
in ethiopia but only a few operate in eritrea and tigray 
those agencies operating in the war area include the 
international committee of the red cross medicins sans frontieres 
of belguim and catholic relief services

a potential juror in the cocaine trial of 
john zaccaro jr said she thought the press picked on his family 
during the 1984 vice presidential candidacy of his mother 
geraldine ferraro 
the woman was one of 15 candidates selected after painstaking 
questioning of 25 people during jury selection which resumed this 
morning for a third day 
opening arguments were expected later today or thursday twelve 
jurors and two alternates are needed for the trial 
addison county states attorney john quinn said the selection of 
a jury was slowed by the publicity given the case and the fact 
ferraro is so wellknown 
selecting a jury is probably the most important part of the 
case he said quinn said if even one juror bore a grudge it 
could influence the jurys verdict 
most of those questioned said they had read newspaper accounts 
of the case since zaccaro 24 was charged in 1986 with selling 
onequarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police agent 
one potential juror said today that he would discount anything 
he read in the newspapers though because of a basic distrust of the 
press they have a tendency to present people as guilty just 
because they have been charged said donald cioffi 
only one person has been dismissed for acknowleging that the 
prominence of zaccaros mother could affect his view of the case 
jury pool member joanne cillo said tuesday that she felt that 
press treatment of ferraro during the 1984 campaign carried over to 
zaccaro 
i cant say i dont feel the press picked on these people 
cillo said when asked if she was pleased with how ferraro has been 
treated 
she said her views would not interfere with her judgment if she 
is chosen to hear the case the press is not trying this case 
she said the issue is did this gentleman sell drugs 
i dont believe its up to me to make restitution for what the 
press may or may not have done she added 
zaccaro then a senior at middlebury college pleaded innocent 
to the charge he has been accompanied to court each day by his 
mother and father john zaccaro sr 
ferraro a lawyer sat behind her son and his lawyers taking 
notes intently but stopping when cillo spoke about her family at 
that point she rested her head in her hand and looked down 
she later declined to comment on the case telling one reporter 
its nothing against you personally were just not answering 
anything for anybody 
the start of mondays trial came two years after her son was 
arrested outside the middlebury restaurant where he worked 
six reporters were allowed to watch the questioning which was 
briefly interrupted monday when judge francis mccaffrey imposed and 
then lifted a gag order on reporters covering jury selection 
defense lawyers sought the gag order for fear too many reporters 
could intimidate potential jurors but mccaffrey lifted it 
following a challenge from reporters and an agreement to limit 
their number in the courtroom 
the case has wound its way slowly through the courts zaccaros 
attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and claimed 
unsuccessfully that zaccaro was singled out for prosecution because 
of his mother 
the vermont supreme court refused to dismiss the case

the albuquerque nm tribune on edwin meese 
when a high officials political foes call for his resignation 
he does well to ignore them but when political friends urge him to 
leave he ought to pay attention 
unfortunately attorney general edwin meese insists on hanging 
on to his job by his fingernails despite wellintentioned advice 
by respected associates that he no longer can fulfill his important 
duties 
meese the artful dodger of the reagan administration has had a 
special prosecutor on his tail for much of the four years he has 
been the nations highest law enforcement officer that doesnt 
seem untoward to him but it does to many of us 
we know a defendant must be presumed innocent until proven 
guilty but the attorney general should be presumed honorable 
clean and competent which his top aides at justice decline to do

evansville ind courier on privatization of the us postal 
service 
in a report more likely to gather dust than to trigger immediate 
action a presidential commission has come up with an intelligent 
plan for privatizing the us postal service 
opponents of privatization point out that the existing 
government monopoly subsidizies the extra costs of rural mail 
delivery with revenues from urban and suburban delivery 
they predict that if private delivery companies were allowed to 
enter the market they would concentrate only on highvolume 
lowcost areas and leave the feds stuck with the unprofitable rural 
routes 
the commissions response start by allowing free competition 
only in rural delivery 
if private companies succeed in serving rural households at 
prices no higher than those of the postal service this strategy 
could go a long way toward calming the fears of rural america that 
postal privatization would leave them underserved 
president reagans successor should see to it that the 
experiment gets a chance

the times trenton nj on edwin meese 
if the justice department has been functioning just 
fine wed hate to see it when it needed a tuneup 
two top officials and their four highest aides quit abruptly 
attorney general edwin meese is the focus of protracted 
criminal investigations by a special prosecutor into two separate 
cases wedtech and the iraqi oil pipeline 
the attorney general is the nations chief law enforcement 
officer he must also be on top of the daytoday efforts of 
the federal government to fight crime 
yet upper management at the department is being decimated and 
the man at the very top is preoccupied with extraneous matters and 
precluded from participating in important issues 
the resignations in the department loudly signal the necessity 
for just one more 
meese should quit now

while some americans remain reluctant to admit it king did much 
of the work necessary to make this country a better place to live

even if his friend and boss reagan has faith in him the high 
government official is causing so many problems for the white house 
that he should have long ago been graciously moved aside now its 
too late 
the fact that reagan has presided over this stumbling entourage 
without becoming thoroughly discredited himself is the ultimate

lawrence kan journal world on presidential campaigns 
so far the race for the president of the united states has been 
largely an activity for ambitious politicians with the great mass 
of americans on the sidelines waiting to see for whom they should 
vote 
the pace is furious and exhausting candidates find themselves 
saying and doing things they never intended when they first 
announced as candidates 
the campaign periods last far too long the costs are terrific 
with a large portion of the expense coming out of tax funds 
the united states needs a discussion of domestic and 
international issues instead of an entertaining endurance contest

the athens ga daily news on the republican presidential 
campaign 
although it has seemed inevitable since his defeat on super 
tuesday sen bob doles decision to withdraw from the republican 
presidential race leaves us with a feeling of frustration about the 
campaign and the system 
dole is an appealing candidate who appears to have a good grasp 
of the countrys needs and how to attack them yet his candidacy is 
over long before much of the countrys voters had an opportunity to 
consider him in primaries 
its possible that republicans would have preferred vice 
president george bush if there had been a national primary after 
extensive campaigning throughout the country but it seems 
unfortunate that a true competition never really developed 
the selection of bush as the nominee this early may give the 
republicans an edge in planning and organizing for the fall 
campaigns but it also gives the democrats a single republican 
target to shoot at when theyre not shooting at each other

the duluth minn newstribune on edwin meese 
what will it take to get attorney general edwin meese to step 
aside as a criminal investigation against him unfolds it might 
take nine months 
in that time regardless of what transpires in the 
investigation a new president will appoint a new attorney general 
however meese should get a strong message from the tandem 
resignations of his top deputy and another high justice department 
official along with four of their aides 
the two justice department officials resignations are still 
another indication that guilty or not meese has become 
ineffective as attorney general 
he should resign and face the charges without crippling the 
activities of the justice department he can best serve by not 
serving

attorney general edwin meese has not been indicted on any 
charge but his questionable behavior has made him a liability to 
president reagan and to the justice department 
in terms of the law meese has to be considered innocent until 
proven guilty but that standard doesnt apply to holding high 
government office where the very appearance of wrongdoing can be 
grounds for departure 
the starbulletin called for meeses resignation on feb 2 the 
latest developments strengthen that conclusion 
meese has shrugged off all such suggestions but he ought to

los angeles times on the contra aid package 
central americans must already understand that the 48 million 
us aid package for the contras and other programs in nicaragua 
was motivated more by partisan us politics than by any deep and 
abiding concern for the plight of the central americans 
both republicans and democrats wanted a defensible record as 
they face elections this year so that they would not be exposed to 
charges that they surrendered central america to the communists or 
prolonged a senseless war 
but there is value in the package the 177 million that will 
move in monthly installments to the contras will provide only food 
cloporarily the 
question of a jackson ticket in the fall not relief kirk 
replied i was impressed with the results of the dukakis 
campaign 
kirk said jackson enjoyed heavy media coverage after his win in 
michigan and dukakis had shown toughness to stick to the issues 
the people looked at us and made a decision as to who they 
thought had the strength and the experience and the values to lead 
this country fortunately i was on top dukakis said on 
nbctvs today show i hope i can do the same in new york i 
believe i can and go on and win the nomination 
jackson who appeared on cbs this morning congratulated 
dukakis for running a good effective campaign in wisconsin 
but noted his own strong showings to date 
of 40 contests that have been run now ive come in no 1 or 
no 2 in 30 of them and i have 250000plus popular vote lead and 
so at this stage of the campaign i feel very good 
the new york contest puts the spotlight on gov mario cuomo who 
has often been mentioned as a potential draft at a deadlocked 
convention but dukakis win is likely to tone down talk of 
drafting cuomo or another democrat 
the new york governor has not made an endorsement but the 
dukakis camp is hoping the wisconsin win could put dukakis in a 
good position to finally win the nod from his fellow governor 
there was a republican primary in wisconsin but there were no 
doubts vice president george bush the nomination his in 
everything but name bested pat robertson by a 101 margin 
in the democratic battle wisconsin gave dukakis the boost he 
had to have and perhaps pointed to a ceiling on jacksons support 
i hope its a sign of things to come said dukakis of what 
he called a great victory 
with 99 percent of the precincts reporting dukakis had 481857 
or 48 percent to 285575 or 28 percent for jackson gore had 
176009 for 17 pecent while simon drew only 48877 about 5 percent 
dukakis edged jackson among bluecollar workers network exit 
polls said and won white union workers outright that was good 
news for the massachusetts governor who needed to show he can win 
that group which is key to the partys hopes in the fall 
even in kenosha county home of the doomed chrysler plant where 
jackson had made a splash by joining the picket line dukakis won 
with better than a 21 margin 
im doing very well with working families because people 
see in me someone who doesnt just talk about jobs dukakis said 
the massachusetts governor also won in colorados precinct 
caucuses which were held monday even though the counting dragged 
into tuesday 
with 77 percent counted dukakis won with 44 percent to 
jacksons 37 percent uncommitted groups took 16 percent and gore 3 
percent 
in the republican caucuses in colorado bush won easily over 
robertson 
dukakiss campaign was in serious trouble after jacksons 
stunning victory in the march 26 caucuses but he has now won three 
of four events in the past eight days adding wisconsin and 
colorado to his connecticut primary win jackson won the virgin 
islands caucuses over the weekend 
this is going to be a 15round bout and it will be by a 
decision theres no such thing as a knockout punch dukakis 
said 
the delegate numbers showed why the democratic race could 
continue to drag on dukakis moved ahead but the partys rules 
splitting the delegates up among the top finishers kept jackson 
close 
despite his victory margin dukakis picked up on 43 delegates in 
wisconsin to 26 for jackson gore won 12 
in colorado dukakis picked up 21 national convention delegates 
and jackson 17 the other seven are uncommitted 
that plus partial wisconsin results left the ap delegate count 
this way dukakis 73555 jacksn 70655 gore 3948 simon 1705 
and uncommitted 5166 a total of 2082 votes are need to win at 
the democratic national convention in atlanta 
tuesdays results give dukakis the momentum going into the new 
york primary where 255 delegates are stake in the biggest single 
state thus far then comes the pennsylvania primary where the 
rules could allow dukakis to win the lions share of the delegates 
on april 26 
perhaps equally important his victories this week give dukakis 
new stronger arguments to make to the senators and representatives 
who will be chosen as super delegates the same week as the new york 
primary 
with the pledged delegate count still close the verdict of the 
unpledged super delegates governors democratic national 
committee members and members of congress could provide the 
numbers to give dukakis a majority 
jackson vowed to press on im a long distance runner he 
said

masked arabs wielding grenades and 
pistols and demanding freedom for proiranian terrorists in kuwait 
today called a doctor aboard a hijacked jet to treat two women 
believed to be members of kuwaits royal family 
the physician identified only as dr qassem was quoted by 
irans islamic republic news agency as describing the condition of 
one of the women as not satisfactory the hijackers reportedly 
said some passengers were unwell 
irans official media reported the five or six arabicspeaking 
hijackers said tuesday that three members of kuwaits royal 
alsabah family on the jet would be in imminent danger unless 
kuwait freed 17 convicted proiranian extremists in 12 hours 
kuwait rejected the demand 
the deadline passed at 10 am 230 am edt according to 
tehran radio the hijackers then contacted the mashhad airport 
tower in northeastern iran to remind that the respite is nearing 
the end irna said 
the doctor did not identify the women he treated or say what was 
wrong with them he said he asked the hijackers to let the womem 
leave the plane but they refused irna said 
according to a passenger list from the kuwait airways boeing 
747 they were the only women among the 87 hostages remaining after 
the release today of 24 female passengers and flight attendants 
the kuwaiti cabinet called the hijackers demands blackmail 
and it sent a team to iran to negotiate with the hijackers after 
meeting in emergency session under crown prince sheik saad 
alabdullah alsabah 
the team made up of an unspecified number of foreign ministry 
officials and some physicians arrived in mashhad this afternoon 
irna reported 
the us state department said it believed there were no 
americans aboard the jet which was commandeered tuesday en route 
to kuwait from bangkok and forced to land in iran the hijackers 
have threatened to blow up the plane 
one man still aboard the plane has a us and an egyptian 
passport 
twelve britons were still on board in london foreign office 
minister lynda chalker said britain stood by kuwaits refusal not 
to yield to the hijackers demands 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said we do not give 
in to blackmail because it only leads to further tragedies 
austrian radio reported that some of the passengers on the plane 
had their hands bound two austrians who work for the computer 
giant ibm in kuwait were among the hostages 
austria sent one of the three diplomats at its tehran embassy to 
help in negotiations with the hijackers 
in vienna austrian foreign ministry spokesman walter greinert 
said iran had informed austria that the passengers are doing well 
under the circumstances 
according to the passenger list the two women from kuwaits 
royal family are ebtesam khaled alsabah and anware khaled 
alsabah a male member of the royal family on the jet was 
identified as fadel khaled alsabah 
kuwaiti sources who demanded anonymity said fadel is a 
businessman and distant relative of kuwaits emir sheik jaber 
alahmed alsabah the target of an assassination attempt by 
proiranian extremists in 1986 
the women were identified as fadels sisters 
irna monitored in nicosia said that in their last contact with 
the control tower today the hijackers asked for breakfast oxygen 
a doctor and a generator to keep the air conditioning working it 
quoted them as telling the airport tower that some of the 
passengers are feeling unwell 
the hijackers also said they did not believe negotiations 
between them and iranian negotiators at the aiport here would prove 
useful irna said 
they repeated a threat to force the plane to take off for an 
unspecified destination 
there have been conflicting reports in the iranian media over 
whether the boeing 747 has been refueled since it landed tuesday 
kuwait has asked iran not to allow the jetliner to take off 
the iranians said the plane will have to leave if the crisis is 
not resolved soon but surrounded it to keep it from taking off 
iranian media said 
the hijackers freed 24 women after negotiations with irans 
deputy prime minister ali reza moayyeri irans official media 
said another passenger a jordanian with a heart condition was 
freed tuesday 
the nationalities of the hijackers were not disclosed but their 
demand echoed that of iranianbacked shiite moslems holding 
american hostages in lebanon that kuwait release 17 militants 
convicted in the december 1983 bombings of the french and us 
embassies and other targets in kuwait 
iran accuses kuwait of aiding iraq in the 7yearold iraniraq 
war kuwait has been a target of iranianbacked shiite terrorists 
for years and has jailed scores for sabotage and bombings since 
1983 
iraq today accused iran of masterminding the hijacking the 
official iraqi news agency quoted an iraqi foreign ministry 
spokesman as saying the hijackers were iranian agents 
among the 97 passengers and 15 crew aboard the plane when it was 
seized were 30 kuwaitis 22 britons eight thais and a person with 
a us and an egyptian passport identified only as r attiaallaali 
according to the passenger list 
irna identified the released women who included five flight 
attendants as 10 britons three thais three egyptians a 
filipina a palestinian a singaporean an irishwoman a german an 
austrian a syrian and a pakistani 
in london prime minister margaret thatcher said we do not 
give in to blackmail because it only leads to further tragedies 
it does seem as if the hijackers have some humane feelings 
after all said the mother of 25yearold nicola appleby a 
briton on the plane who apparently was among the women set free in 
london margaret jones said she was still waiting for news of her 
son mark 23 who boarded the flight from bangkok with his sister

125

that people think its cheaper to park illegally the 100 parking

a 50 cap for the fees municipalities can charge for illegal 
parking 
schwartz said passage is expected

nearly 80 percent of the convicts entering state 
prisons are involved with drugs according to an internal study for 
the texas board of pardons and paroles 
the study which found the typical inmate is an unemployed high 
school dropout with a drug or alcohol problem concludes that crime 
in texas will get worse if the state builds new prisons at the 
expense of education and social programs 
the study of 1483 offenders admitted to the texas department of 
corrections in one month late last year found that fourfifths of 
them whether they were entering prison as a result of a court 
sentence probation violation or parole revocation had used 
drugs were under the influence of drugs when they were arrested or 
were convicted of a drugrelated offense 
texas expenditures for substance abuse are so minimal that 
there are practically no resources available said parole board 
researcher pablo martinez noting that texas ranks near the bottom 
of the 50 states in funding for drug and alcohol programs

the city has gotten tentative approval 
to buy homes repossessed for unpaid government mortgages and sell 
them for 1 to poor families chosen through a raffle officials 
said 
there are going to be some mighty lucky people out there if 
the program wins full approval said phillip aguirre local urban 
homesteading coordinator for the us department of housing and 
urban development 
the city had asked for 600000 to buy homes in three 
neighborhoods but the amount is likely to be less aguirre said 
tuesday 
the application has been approved by hud but the contract 
agreement between the city and the federal government has yet to be 
drawn up 
hud agrees with the plan in principle aguirre said i 
just doubt that it will come out with full funding the first time 
around 
under the homesteading program the buyers must repair maintain 
and occupy the homes for a minimum of five consecutive years 
margi gant the citys community development office coordinator 
said that if 600000 is approved 24 homes could be bought at the 
25000 maximum allowed 
the development office should receive a contract from hud later 
this month officials said 
to get in the lottery home seekers will have to show they 
qualify for a government loan or can do repairs to ensure the home 
is rehabilitated once the work is complete the deed to the home 
will be sold to the purchaser for 1 
the houses repossessed will be those foreclosed on hud or 
federal housing administration loans

a colombian cocaine ring made such enormous 
profits that it created its own courier service to move the cash a 
convicted money launderer told congress today 
basically there is no effective interdiction for money 
ramon milian rodriguez told a senate foreign relations 
subcommittee the problem the launderer faces is security not an 
authority per se 
rodriguez a cubanborn accountant is serving a 43year prison 
term for money laundering he has admitted serving as a chief us 
money launderer for the medillin cartel the drug ring named after 
the colombian city where it is based 
rodriguez said he was handling up to 2 billion a year for the 
cartel 
he showed the subcomittee boxes he said were used by the cartel 
for shipping cash they were inscribed with the name consolidated 
courier services 
the boxes were designed specifically to carry the cash and were 
loaded onto pallets to be lifted aboard airplanes and flown from 
the united states to central america rodriguez told the 
subcommittee 
his testimony came a day after the committee was told that a top 
haitian military officer offered to sell highquality cocaine for 
shipment to the united states flying the drugs from a lighted 
8400foot private airstrip at his ranch 
miami businessman osvaldo quintana described the lavish 
lifestyle of haitian col jeanclaude paul the influence paul 
wielded and the fear he evoked in haitian citizens with whom he 
came in contact quintana said the cocaine deal was discussed at 
the dessaline barracks in portauprince headquarters of an elite 
military unit paul commands 
paul is under indictment in miami on charges of conspiring to 
import cocaine but apparently is out of the reach of us 
authorities because he cannot be extradited quintanas life has 
been threatened by haitian drug figures and he is under protection 
by the us drug enforcement administration 
he testified tuesday before the senate foreign relations 
narcotics subcommittee which is holding a series of hearings on 
the drug trade in latin america the panel planned to call other 
witnesses today to describe money laundering and to spell out how 
the state department used at least one alleged drug trafficker to 
ferry supplies to the usbacked contra rebels in nicaragua 
in federal court in washington on tuesday the committee 
obtained limited immunity from prosecution for future testimony 
from michael b palmer who faces drug charges in michigan palmer 
as an official of the miami aircraft leasing firm vortex had a 
contract in early 1986 with the state departments nicaraguan 
humanitarian assistance organization which funneled humanitarian 
aid to the contras 
michael p vogel another witness before the panel on tuesday 
who now is serving a 12year sentence on marijuana charges said 
palmer had been arrested along with himself on identical charges 
but was dropped from the indictment in march of 1986 while under 
contract to the state department 
it is unusual it is strange vogel said 
he acknowledged he once had felt bitterness about what he saw as 
palmers preferential treatment but said he now was more concerned 
about the corrupting influence of drugs 
you cant use drug smugglers for other tasks by the 
government vogel said 
the miami businessman quintana told the panel he had run an 
honest seafood brokerage enterprise until he was approached in 1986 
by marie merielle delinois then pauls wife about a seafood deal 
paul at first offered to sell seafood at below market prices and 
asked a 1apound commission he said 
but the deal later turned into a drug transaction and paul 
arranged for 412 kilos of cocaine to be flown from a grass airstrip 
on his ranch 90 miles from the haitian capital quintana said 
when quintana and an associate told paul they needed a sample of 
the cocaine which tested at about 90 percent pure to take back to 
the united states the colonel personally carried it past customs 
officials in his holster for them quintana testified 
paul was able to identify us drug and cia agents in his 
country because he had a contact inside the us embassy in 
portauprince he said 
but a pilot hired to carry the drugs to the united states landed 
in the bahamas and stole them he told the subcommittee as 
guarantor of the 4 million deal quintana was threatened by 
haitians who had provided the drugs when he tried to get them 
back he walked into a dea sting operation and was arrested 
quintana said 
quintana was later sent out by the dea to make further contacts 
with paul as an undercover operative and it was his testimony 
which enabled the indictment to be obtained

battle for supremacy in which police say 12 people have been killed 
and 34 wounded 
a police spokesman said the mainstream amal militia used armored 
vehicles artillery mortars and rocketpropelled grenades against

militia officers also toured the south in loudspeaker vans 
blaring warnings to hezbollah fighters to surrender their weapons 
and avert the bloodshed the police spokesman said 
he quoted amal as telling hezbollah gunmen our main aim is 
security and stability for the south whoever surrenders his weapon 
will live in peace 
fear was expressed in many circles that the war for supremacy in 
the predominantly shiite region would spread to the rest of 
lebanon which has been ravaged by civil war for 13 years this led 
the nations most leading shiite cleric sheik mohammed hussein 
fadlallah to order an end to the battle 
we prohibit this fighting because it burns islams causes and 
the moslems he said in a fatwa or religious ruling 
despite fadlallahs declaration amalhezbollah fighting raged 
all day from nabatiyeh an inland market town to the ancient port 
of tyre 
the police spokesman whose name was withheld in accordance with 
regulations gave this account 
amal forces with armored personnel carriers and 106mm recoilless 
artillery advanced across nabatiyehs main street to the towns old 
sector where hezbollah fighters were installed in sniping nests 
the fighting in nabatiyeh is ferocious rescue teams have not 
been able to evacuate casualties in some parts of the town 
nabatiyeh citizens have been hiding in basements and bomb shelters 
since tuesday 
about 50 women and old men ventured out in a relatively quiet 
neighborhood chanting slogans demanding an end to the fighting 
but dashed for cover again when two mortar rounds slammed into 
the neighborhood

hezbollah fighters to surrender 
all amal and hezbollah fighters in south lebanon are on full 
alert each side has erected checkpoints in its areas of influence 
to prevent the other from reinforcing its positions 
fighting began tuesday when hezbollah gunmen attacked an amal 
checkpoint near nabatiyeh killing an amal militiaman and wounding 
four others the police spokesman said the attack followed amal 
raids on houses in nabatiyeh and surrounding villages in which 10 
hezbollah members were captured 
he said amal was searching for hezbollah members suspected of 
opening fire monday on the car of the amal chief in nabatiyeh 
mahmoud faqih who was not in the vehicle

the judge in the irancontra case today ruled 
he needed more time to study independent counsel lawrence e 
walshs plan to prevent unauthorized disclosure of 150000 pages of 
classified documents 
in a brief opinion us district judge gerhard a gesell denied 
walshs motion for expedited consideration of the proposed 
protective order saying it appears to be far too complex lacks 
definite time restrictions and creates undue obstacles to the fair 
and expeditious disposition of this case 
but the judge said he wants to set an april deadline for walshs 
review of the classified material and fix a time for the defense to 
notify the court whether it intends to use any of the secret 
documents as evidence 
gesell said he would hear further argument at next tuesdays 
hearing on the timing of discovery disclosures in relation to a 
realistic trial date 
the documents which walsh says describe in detail some of the 
nations most carefully held secrets about its foreign policy its 
intelligence activities and its covert activities must be turned 
over to the defense as part of pretrial discovery 
some of the documents from the cia the state department the 
national security council and other agencies may be introduced as 
evidence after they are declassified or secret material is deleted 
lawyers for former national security adviser john poindexter 
lt col oliver l north and arms dealers richard v secord and 
albert hakim had filed a motion opposing walshs plan to require 
them and their clients to obtain security clearances to examine the 
material 
the four are accused of conspiracy to defraud the government by 
diverting armssale proceeds to the nicaraguan rebels 
walsh had sought expedited consideration of his plan by the 
judge 
but gesell said it will be necessary to frame a more limited 
protective order fashioned to the nature of this case which in 
essence alleges a course of conduct carried out using classified 
materials in classified channels from a highly classified site 
the proposal includes setting up a secure compartmented 
information facility where the defense lawyers would be required 
to work with the documents and compose any pleadings that quote the 
material 
without such procedures walsh said he cannot begin turning 
over the material to the defense for pretrial discovery 
walsh had also asked gesell to establish intricate procedures 
under the classified information procedures act cipa for court 
review of classified documents to determine how such information 
could be disclosed in court 
the act empowers a trial judge to delete classified portions of 
a document if it is irrelevent to the case or to substitute a 
statement of facts that secret material would prove if shown to a 
jury 
in a joint pleading filed tuesday defense lawyers opposed 
walshs motion because it raised questions about the 
constitutionality as well as the statutory propriety of various 
aspects of the proposed order even if the cipa itself is 
constitutional 
the defense said it wants more time to file briefs on a number 
of issues it contends are raised by walshs proposal 
the defense contends that the proposed order would impose 
improper and questionable conditions on the defense lawyers and 
their clients 
the defense noted that the order would apply to classified 
information that had already been known to the defendants 
particularly north and poindexter 
the attorneys also questioned whether walsh as an independent 
counsel has the proper authority to enforce the classified 
information procedures act 
the defense said walshs request raises questions whether the 
presidents foreign affairs and national security responsibilities 
can be delegated to an official such as mr walsh 
in reply walsh said the defense was attempting to invent 
substantive isues concerning the proposed protective order where 
none exists 
walsh labeled transparent the defense objection to applying 
the restrictions to north and poindexter 
classified information does not become declassified because a 
criminal defendant knew it before he was indicted if that were the 
case there would have been no need for the cipa in the many 
espionage trials where the statute has been used extensively 
walsh said

attack on civilians could prompt some of the 65000 israelis living 
in the west bank and gaza strip to take vigilante action

officials investigating the hijack of a 
kuwait airways jet that departed from bangkok were told wednesday 
that four passengers may have boarded with forged bahraini 
passports 
a senior member of the thai police force who asked not to be 
identified told the associated press that bahraini officials had 
contacted the thais concerning the possible fogery the identities 
of the four have not been released 
the thai government has made virtually no statements on the 
hijack of flight 422 which was commandeered tuesday while en route 
from bangkok to kuwait and it appeared to be trying to keep the 
investigation on a low key possibly to avoid embarrassment should 
a security flaw at the airport be discovered 
vidhya rayanonda a foreign ministry spokesman told reporters 
he did not think thailands image would be damaged because 
hijacks occur everywhere 
vidhya said security at bangkoks don muang international 
airport was adequate and he raised the possibility that the weapons 
used by the hijackers might have been put on the boeing 747 in 
kuwait the airliner flew into bangkok from kuwait on monday and 
was on the ground for about 15 hours before taking off for kuwait 
one passenger was quoted by iranian media as saying the 
hijackers were armed with pistols and hand grenades 
we still dont know where the weapons came from or how they 
got there on the plane in the first place said charoon 
peetong the general manager of the airport 
but we are looking for serious answers to our questions 
though answers will more likely be found in mashhad he said 
referring to the northeastern iranian city where the plane was 
diverted 
charoon said authorities were doublechecking all personnel who 
were near the jumbo jet before takeoff tuesday including the 
airlines caterer ground mechanics and those who refueled the 
aircraft he said 
there have been no known major complaints from foreign 
governments or international agencies about security at bangkok 
airport passengers and carryon luggage are searched by electronic 
devices

mecham who described himself as the recent former governor 
appeared relaxed tuesday i have no rancor in my heart for 
anybody he said 
however he warned that those who ousted him may not realize 
they have awakened a sleeping giant in the arizona electorate 
i know that they are aroused i know that they are incensed i 
know that they are rightdown angry said mecham 
he jokingly referred to the kiwanis group as the roundeyes 
club recalling the day several months ago when mecham was 
severely criticized for telling the same group that when a group of 
japanese people were told about arizonas golf courses suddenly 
they got round eyes 
recalling his remark the former governor said thats an 
inhouse joke between me and this club and lets see about half 
the world i think 
mecham who also provoked criticism for comments that were 
perceived as slurs against blacks homosexuals and jews became the 
first governor to be removed from office in 59 years on monday when 
the senate convicted him of obstructing justice and misusing 
80000 from the governors protocol fund 
several weeks ago mecham had said that if the senate convicted 
him he might go to the us supreme court to claim that his rights 
had been violated he said tuesday he had not decided whether he 
will do so 
mecham also faces a criminal trial april 21 on charges of 
concealing a 350000 campaign loan if convicted he would be 
barred from holding office again 
but mecham said today he was confident that if justice prevails 
he will be found innocent if we can get a fair jury we should 
get acquitted quite easily he said on good morning america

a federal quarantine to help prevent the 
spread of a tiny killer mite that threatens the us bee industry 
has been ordered for 13 states where the pest has been detected so 
far the agriculture department said wednesday 
the restrictions effective immediately ban the shipment from 
those states of bees and apiary equipment said larry b slagle 
acting associate administrator of the departments animal and plant 
health inspection service 
states affected by the quarantine are florida illinois maine 
michigan mississippi nebraska new york ohio pennsylvania 
south carolina south dakota washington and wisconsin 
of the major honey producing states only california and north 
dakota so far remain unaffected by the mites whose scientific name 
is varroa jacobsoni the female is about onetwentieth of an inch 
in diameter and the male is somewhat smaller 
the mites were first discovered in the united states last 
september in a wisconsin apiary and since have spread to the 12 
other states 
varroa mites can be spread by the movement of queen bees 
package bees hives pollen honeycomb with brood cells and apiary 
equipment and vehicles slagle said under our regulations 
these articles will be prohibited from moving interstate from 
quarantined areas unless certain conditions are met 
if agency inspectors determine that there is no risk of mites 
they can issue certificates allowing the movement of articles out 
of the quarantined states he said in other cases a limited 
permit may be issued to move articles that not pose a pest risk 
provided that additional precautions are taken 
slagle said the quarantine order will help protect our 
beekeeping industry as well as the estimated 20 billion worth of 
agricultural crops pollinated by bees each year 
the varroa mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their 
developing larvae or brood slagle said the pests cause decreased 
brood deformed bees and weakening of the colonys ability to 
pollinate plants and produce honey infestation can occur so 
gradually that the mites may go unnoticed until serious damage is 
done

a judge has ordered a woman to return 25000 she 
paid her lawyers from money donated for her 7yearold sons liver 
transplants 
the withdrawal was an illegal and unlawful act circuit 
judge francis j christie said tuesday during a hearing on the 
action by maria desillers she must return that sum to the 
ronnies estate which subsequently and ironically she could 
very well become heir to 
ronnie died april 29 while awaiting a fourth liver transplant at 
childrens hospital of pittsburgh his plight moved hundreds of 
people including president reagan to donate more than 670000 
for his operations 
ms desillers paid 25000 to the fatherandson law office of 
leonard and harry robbins who argued tuesday that she was entitled 
to use the money 
desillers was a woman alone in the world leonard robbins 
said all she knew was that she was being attacked from all 
sides when she went to hire an attorney 
during the hearing trust curator karen gievers claimed that the 
law office had violated state probate and banking laws by accepting 
the money ms gievers was appointed trust curator last month to 
oversee the 239287 that remains in ronnies trust accounts 
harry robbins said he will continue representing ms desillers 
regardless of her financial troubles 
childrens hospital of pittsburgh is suing ms desillers for 
262000 what it claims is the unpaid portion of ronnies 424300 
medical bill ms desillers has said she refused to pay the balance 
because of allegedly poor care she and harry robbins have said 
they plan to countersue the hospital 
the state has filed an administrative complaint against ms 
desillers and fined her 1000 for allegedly violating charity 
laws the complaint and fine are being appealed 
ms desillers use of ronnies trust also is being investigated 
by dade state attorney janet reno that investigation prompted ms 
gievers appointment

vietnam on wednesday delivered remains 
said to be those of 27 missing americans and it threatened to stop 
the search if the united states continues accusing it of playing 
politics with the dead 
in a solemn military ceremony 27 sets of remains were put on a 
us air force transport jet to be flown to army laboratories in 
honolulu for authentication it was the largest delivery yet by the 
vietnamese 
hanoi also turned over three sets of remains described as those 
of ethnic asians who also may be missing americans from the long 
war in vietnam which ended with a communist victory in april 1975 
the large delivery had encouraged us officials to anticipate 
more help from hanoi but senior vietnamese had sharp comments 
about allegations that they warehouse remains and return them 
gradually for political reasons 
they also said washington should help finance vietnams 
reconstruction if it wants a full accounting of the 1767 americans 
still listed as missing in action 
foreign minister nguyen co thach who met with us sen larry 
pressler rsd on wednesday responded very angrily to a 
recent pentagon statement that vietnam was returning remains 
gradually said an american participant in the talks 
that is nonsense nguyen can head of vietnams mia 
accounting office said in an interview tuesday the next time 
they make such a statement we will have to reconsider whether we 
will do the job this shows there is no goodwill on the part of the 
us 
two dozen peasants in conical bamboo hats squatting in an 
adjacent field watched as the 27 small caskets each with a folded 
american flag on top were placed into the belly of the giant c141 
aircraft at noi bai airport 
pressler a vietnam veteran and member of the senate foreign 
relations committee joined a military team from the us joint 
casualty resolution center in saluting the caskets as they passed 
on the tarmac under overcast skies 
vietnam provided names for at least half the 27 remains said 
lt col paul mather of the joint casualty resolution center they 
were not made public 
this being the largest we hope it means increased 
collaboration said maj virginia pribyla a spokeswoman for the 
us pacific command she also said however that the united 
states believes vietnam has more information than it has divulged 
it was the fourth return of remains since vietnam agreed in 
talks with us envoy john w vessey in august to resume its mia 
accounting efforts 
nguyen dy nien a deputy foreign minister accompanied it with 
an accusation tuesday that the united states had not met the terms 
of the agreement because it had given no direct government aid for 
reconstruction 
since the accord vietnam has received only two shipments of 
prosthetic equipment both from private agencies in the united 
states 
some us officials suspect the vietnamese are trying to move 
toward normal relations through governmenttogovernment links on 
the humanitarian aid issue 
the united states has said frequently said it will not establish 
diplomatic relations or lift its trade embargo until vietnam makes 
as full an accounting as possible of the mias and leaves cambodia 
which it invaded in december 1978 
washington has sent investigative medical teams to vietnam and 
encouraged private aid but has not lifted an embargo on official 
aid imposed as a protest of the occupation 
hanoi has returned 152 remains the army laboratories have 
confirmed as those of mias the previous largest transfer was on 
aug 14 1985 involving 26 sets of remains at least 24 of which 
were confirmed

a judge today granted surrogate mother mary 
beth whiteheadgould immediate unsupervised visitation of eight 
hours a week with the child she agreed to bear under a 10000 
contract 
superior court judge birger m sween said mrs whiteheadgoulds 
visits with 2yearold melissa stern would be expanded from one 
eighthour day weekly to two days every other week in september 
overnight visits in april 1989 and two weeks during that summer 
the court finds no credible evidence or expert opinion that 
melissa will suffer any psychological or emotional harm by 
continued and expanded visitation with her mother sween said 
his order barred both sides in the case from discussing melissa 
publicly such as in the promotion of books or movies 
the sterns had argued during a threeday visitation hearing last 
week that mrs whiteheadgould would use melissa in a tour to 
promote a book she is writing about the case 
sweens order doesnt not affect publication of mrs 
whiteheadgoulds book however nor does it have any effect on a 
television movie being made about the case 
the judge also ordered the adults in the case to undergo 
counseling to ease the emotional burden on the child who lives 
with her father william stern and his wife elizabeth the 
sterns who hired mrs whiteheadgould as a surrogate have custody 
of melissa 
the court finds that melissas best interests will be served 
by unsupervised uninterrupted liberal visitation with her 
mother sween said in a written decision given to attorneys 
she and her mother have the right to develop their own special 
relationship the judge said 
in a statement issued by her attorneys mrs whiteheadgould 
said she was happy her relationship with her daughter has been 
preserved 
i am delighted and grateful to know that as melissa grows up 
well have a meaningful and substantial relationship with each 
other she said 
the sterns were disappointed by the decision said their 
attorney gary skoloff noting that the sterns had sought to delay 
contact between mrs whiteheadgould and melissa for several years 
we did not get the hiatus we asked for said skoloff they 
were pleased with the mandatory counseling and they were pleased 
with the privacy issue 
he said the sterns would make no public statement on the ruling 
skoloff had said following the threeday hearing last week that 
the couple did not plan to appeal sweens decision whatever the 
outcome 
the sterns argued that visitation should be stopped for at least 
six years while mrs whiteheadgould sought the gradually 
expanded unsupervised visitation she won today 
mrs whiteheadgould an east brunswick housewife who turns 31 
thursday was allowed to visit the child for two hours once a week 
under supervision during the legal battle 
she testified during the custody hearing that her daughter would 
benefit by a more natural relationship with her mother 
the sterns said they feared mrs whiteheadgould could 
emotionally harm the child and try to undermine their relationship 
with melissa 
if there is no appeal todays ruling would bring to a close a 
highly publicized unprecedented court battle that sparked a 
worldwide debate on parents rights and reproductive technologies 
the dispute began shortly after the childs birth march 31 
1986 when mrs whiteheadgould then married to richard whitehead 
and the mother of two decided to turn down the 10000 surrogacy 
fee and refused to hand over the child no money ever changed 
hands mrs whiteheadgould is now expecting her fourth child by 
her second husband dean gould 
the sterns turned to surrogacy because they feared mrs stern 
42 who suffers from a mild form of multiple sclerosis could 
develop complications with the disease during pregnancy 
mrs whiteheadgould fled with the baby to florida for three 
months before authorities tracked her down and returned the child 
to the sterns setting the stage for the emotional court battle 
over custody 
after a threemonth trial superior court judge harvey r sorkow 
upheld the surrogate contract and stripped mrs whiteheadgould of 
her parental rights ordering her never to see the child again the 
judge then presided over a speedy adoption of the child by mrs 
stern 
but the new jersey supreme court overturned most of sorkows 
ruling in its landmark feb 3 ruling the states highest court 
outlawed surrogacyforpay and restored mrs whiteheadgoulds 
parental rights but upheld custody for the sterns while ordering 
the lower court hearing on visitation rights

an alleged cocaine trafficker wanted for 
questioning in the slaying of a us drug agent was imprisoned 
today in the maximumsecurity federal penitentiary at marion ill 
authorities said after being picked up in a predawn helicopter 
raid at his home in honduras 
juan ramon matta 43 was lodged in a cell at marion which the 
federal prison system uses to house its most dangerous criminals 
said kathryn morse a spokeswoman for the us bureau of prisons 
matta was taken by us marshals to marion early today after 
honduran police arrested him at his home in tegucigalpa early 
tuesday and put him on a flight headed for the dominican republic 
without a passport us law enforcement sources said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
he was arrested by us marshals aboard a new yorkbound 
jetliner after being kicked out of the dominican republic by 
officials who had been informed that he was wanted in the united 
states authorities reported 
in addition to drug charges the drug enforcement administration 
wants to question him about the 1985 murder in mexico of dea agent 
enrique camarena salazar according to one us law enforcement 
source dea agents have already interviewed matta briefly since his 
arrival in the united states 
camarena was kidnapped tortured and killed in guadalajara 
mexico in a slaying allegedly ordered by drug traffickers john c 
lawn the head of the dea said that matta was one of the four 
prime suspects in the case 
the successful taking into us custody of matta was the result 
of more than a month of sensitive negotiations between honduran and 
us officials a us law enforcement source said today 
howard safir the chief of operations for the marshals service 
spent the last three to six weeks in honduras spearheading the 
effort to get matta into the hands of the united states said the 
source speaking on condition of anonymity 
honduran government sources said that president jose azcona hoyo 
met with top civilian and security officials to discuss mattas 
case 
according to other us law enforcement sources matta was taken 
into custody by honduran police in the airborne helicopter raid on 
a warrant signed by a city judge 
mattas wife nancy vasquez said that police and the judge had 
placed bag of cocaine on the table in their house and said they had 
found it there she said there had been no drugs at the residence 
carlos lorenzana mattas lawyer said in a telephone interview 
that about 60 heavily armed policemen using helicopters arrived at 
his clients home at 545 am tuesday 
matta was stunned by the raid said a us law enforcement 
source he couldnt believe it 
matta had been living openly in honduras after escaping in 1986 
from a colombian prison 
he had been held in colombia on charges of involvement with the 
medellin cartel the worlds largest cocainetrafficking 
organization 
lorenzana said matta as a honduran citizen could not be 
extradited to the united states because the constitution forbids 
it 
the marshals service said the expulsion from the dominican 
republic was based on a us warrant for matta after he escaped 
from eglin federal prison camp in florida in 1971 he was serving a 
fiveyear sentence for illegally entering the united states and 
using a fraudulent visa 
matta arrived at new yorks kennedy international airport early 
today on a flight from san juan puerto rico said lt kevin ward 
of the port authority police 
he was accompanied by three federal marshals who put him aboard 
a government jet 
warrants charge matta with escape from federal custody 
conspiracy to smuggle cocaine possession with intent to distribute 
cocaine engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise and other 
crimes 
this arrest is a major milestone in our worldwide assault on 
illegal drug trafficking stanley e morris director of the us 
marshals service in washington said tuesday 
the marshals service said matta was believed to have become a 
leader of a group of traffickers that controlled the flow of 
illegal drugs from mexico 
us authorities link mattas return to honduras to an increase 
in transshipment of colombian cocaine through the central american 
country 
allegations have been made of involvement by top honduran 
military officials 
the government denied the reports in february azcona said 
critics were trying to discredit the armed forces and my 
government which has taken a series of actions to combat the drug 
traffickers 
matta told the associated press in february he makes his living 
in cattle ranching construction and the tobacco spice and coffee 
trade his wealth has been estimated at up to 2 billion but he 
put it at about 5 million 
he said the charges against him were a lie a story and 
claimed us agents tried three times in the past year to kidnap 
him 
matta said then he never again would leave honduras if i 
appear in the united states it is a kidnapping by american agents 
if i am killed it is the dea he said at the time

jerry brown whose unorthodox style 
and ideas made him one of the nations hot young politicians in the 
1970s celebrates his 50th birthday thursday the way he has spent 
most of the last six years in private 
brown has been dropping hints in recent months that he plans a 
comeback possibly a race for the us senate in 1992 but he says 
the time is not yet right to seek the media spotlight again 
therefore he vetoed plans by a group of friends and supporters 
for a birthday celebration this week at a los angeles hotel with 
1000 to 1500 guests 
its just not the right time brown told reporters if i 
were more active in the public domain then it might be 
appropriate 
instead brown will celebrate thursday with what he describes as 
a small family gathering 
reclusiveness has been browns way since he lost a race for the 
us senate six years ago to republican pete wilson he has spent 
most of the past six years traveling with especially long stays in 
mexico and japan and writing a stillunfinished book 
that defeat ended eight years in which brown was constantly in 
the media spotlight with two successful races for governor two 
unsuccessful campaigns for the democratic nomination for president 
and the senate race 
brown chafed at the constant attention even during the campaign 
periods when he was working hardest to attract coverage and he 
seemed to be genuinely relieved at his close defeat in the senate 
race the people would like a respite from me and in some 
ways i need a respite from them he said in his concession 
speech 
even in that speech brown said he planned to return to

a new plastic surgery technique which moves fatty 
tissue from the saddle bags area of the thigh offers victims of 
breast cancer another option in reconstruction surgery says the 
surgeon who developed it 
medical science may someday eliminate breast cencer said 
franklyn elliott an atlanta plastic surgeon but in the 
meantime we can take the fear out of the surgery people wont be 
so terrified it wont be maiming to so many people 
the procedure developed by elliott and his associate dr philip 
h beegle jr has been performed just four times at st josephs 
hospital of atlanta the first was in december 
after diseased cancerous tissue is removed plastic surgeons 
implant the fatty tissue and the artery that feeds it to replace 
the lost breast tissue 
the surgeons connect the artery and vein in the thigh tissue 
into an artery and vein in the armpit area the plastic surgeons 
use a small piece of skin from the thigh to replace the areola and 
nipple which are removed as part of the cancer surgery 
when the patient wakes up she has two breasts both of which 
are her own tissue 
for years cancer patients who had to have breasts removed could 
only wear a padded bra after the surgery then doctors developed 
implants to replace the lost tissue in the 1980s a variety of 
replacement surgeries were developed using the patients own 
tissue from the abdomen or the buttock 
we went to work in the lab and found this pocket of tissue 
that is fairly easily removed and has its own blood supply said 
beegle it gives the patient another option 
todays options for a breast cancer patient include breast 
removal or if the cancer is detected very early the tumors can be 
removed in a lumpectomy which is followed by radiation 
treatment 
if the treatment is a mastectomy removal of the breast and 
lymph nodes the patient can select from several forms of 
reconstruction including a combination of her own tissue and a 
small implant elliott said 
arthur holleb a former breast cancer surgeon and now chief 
medical officer for the american cancer society in new york said 
breast cancer can bring psychological problems 
the impact of the psychosocial decision is tremendous he 
said in a telephone interview from his office the society he 
said has a visitation program in hospitals which assists 70000 
breast cancer patients each year 
the anxiety varies from woman to woman the breast is so 
important to most women said john bostwick nationally known 
plastic surgeon from emory university 
its such a shock to a young woman to have a breast cancer 
particularly if she is young and healthy and the treatment is 
going to do a lot to hurt her feminity he said we find if we 
can tell them we can do a reconstruction it helps 
the replacement with saddle bags tissue is an easier 
operation than replacement from the buttocks beegle said 
i think their technique is very innovative for selected women 
its going to be very worthwhile bostwick said 
for the woman who doesnt have a lot of tissue in the abdomen 
it provides another alternative to to find the tissue for 
reconstruction 
in one patient who lost both breasts we used tissue from the 
abdomen on one side and from the hip on the other elliott said 
it allows us to have the luxury of the option 
only about 10 percent of 15 percent of the breast cancer 
patients in the atlanta area now seek reconstruction but the 
number is increasing the surgeons said 
early detection of breast cancer through selfexamination and 
mammograpny has lowered the age of breast cancer patients they 
said meaning the patient is more likely to seek reconstruction 
this procedure doesnt leave a scar on the abdomen and the 
incision to remove the thigh tissues is concealed under the buttock 
so after recovery the patient will feel comfortable in shorts a 
tennis dress or a bathing suit the scar wont show elliott said

hungary on wednesday launched its 
strongest criticism yet on communist ally romania over an ethnic 
dispute that has clouded relations between the warsaw pact 
neighbors for two years 
two hungarian newspapers printed editorials fiercely critical of 
a reported romanian move to use only romanianlanguage place names 
for cities and villages traditionally known to romanias german and 
hungarian ethnic minorities in their own languages 
about 17 million hungarians and 220000 ethnic germans live in 
romania mostly in the central province of transylvania hungary 
has expressed mounting concern over what it says are romanian moves 
to cut back hungarianlanguage education and disperse the minority 
throughout romania 
romania charges that hungarys complaints mask an effort by 
budapest to regain transylvania which was ruled by hungary for 
several centuries but given to romania after world war i 
both claim that transylvania is the area where their nations 
were first settled and they have squabbled over the region for 
decades 
in the past two years however the dispute has escalated 
pointing up the difference between hungarys reformist communism 
and the tight rule of president nicolae ceausescu in romania which 
is increasingly isolated from its east bloc allies 
the government daily magyar hirlap said violations of minority 
rights to maintain their own language and culture can neither be 
understood or accepted at the end of the 20th century on our 
continent 
the harsh editorial stopped short of blaming ceausescu for the 
move to use only romanian place names but said it could hardly 
be a local excess since to our knowledge the strings reach 
much higher 
another daily magyar nemzet condemned ceausescus recently 
announced program to wipe out up to 7000 villages in romania by 
the year 2000 as drastic demolition and an attempt to quash 
romanian hungarian and other minority cultures 
magyar hirlap also took romania to task for its unprecedented 
action in denying hungarys bucharest ambassador a traditional 
address on national radio and television to mark hungarys 
liberation day april 4 
the newspaper noted this was a break with tradition and said 
without further detail that it is regrettable that such themes 
can emerge between two neighboring socialist countries 
western analysts said wednesdays attacks were the sharpest yet 
in the war of words between the nations 
hungarian dissidents who demonstrated for human rights in 
romania outside the romanian embassy in budapest on feb 1 have 
charged the budapest government is to some extent exploiting 
popular hungarian unease about the treatment of ethnic hungarians 
in romania to divert attention from the countrys economic crisis 
but hungary took unprecedented action last month when it 
approved spending about 6 million to help an estimated 10000 
refugees who have fled the shortages and harsh living conditions in 
romania for hungary many but not all of the refugees are ethnic 
hungarians

the state senate voted today to pay former 
gov evan mechams 202433 in legal fees for the impeachment trial 
that removed him from office 
the 1613 vote came shortly before the senate formally closed 
the impeachment trial that began feb 29 and resulted in mechams 
ouster from office on monday 
defense attorney jerris leonard had asked the senate to begin a 
healing process by paying the fees 
this has been an agony leonard said i think its the 
right thing to do to show that this body not only has class 
but it has heart it has compassion 
republican sen greg lunn agreed saying it would be a 
magnanimous gesture 
gop sen pat wright said she thought mechams legal fees should 
be paid because arizona taxpayers funded the prosecution and trial 
and many resent deeply their tax dollars being used to convict a 
governor that they supported 
however sen john mawhinney also a republican argued against 
paying the defense costs 
we didnt start this process the house of representatives 
didnt start this process when it impeached mecham mawhinney 
said evan mecham the governor started the process 
mawhinney said that if senators wanted to show compassion they 
might want to pay the legal fees themselves adding i cant 
believe you can do that with somebody elses money 
democratic sen chuy higuera suggested that the state and mecham 
split the cost 
the senate voted monday to remove mecham a firstterm 
republican from office for obstructing justice by trying to thwart 
an investigation of an alleged death threat and for misusing 
80000 from the governors protocol fund by loaning it to his auto 
dealership 
gop sen john hays said he thought the matter should be referred 
to the legislature and suggested that the 92000 governors 
protocol fund which remains in a bank might be used to pay 
mechams expenses 
leonard said he expected to be paid whether the money came from 
the state or mecham himself 
the attorney said that when he met with mecham after his 
conviction i found not one sign of retribution in him of any 
thought of revenge or rancor 
he said to us that when your first vote was completed that 
he felt relieved leonard said 
the prosecution took no position on whether mechams fees should 
be paid prosecutor paul eckstein said the matter should be up to 
the senates discretion

deposits at federally insured savings 
institutions grew for the fifth consecutive month in february 
continuing a trend begun after the october stock market crash the 
government said wednesday 
the federal home loan bank board which regulates 3126 savings 
institutions said net deposits increased by 52 billion compared 
with a 54 billion increase in january and a 11 billion net 
withdrawal in february 1987 
the increase came despite the deteriorating financial condition 
of many thrift institutions particularly in texas where 
institutions have been hit hard by the depressed energy and real 
estate markets 
a third of the industry lost money last year pushing overall 
1987 losses to a postdepression record of 68 billion 
despite the losses money has been flowing into sampl accounts 
which are insured up to 100000 since the crash 62 billion in 
october 32 billion in november and 26 billion in december 
that is reversing what was described as a slowmotion run on 
sampls which had net withdrawals in seven of the first nine months 
of last year 
i think youre still getting as late as it seems a kind of 
stock market effect here said mark obrinsky an economist with 
the us league of savings institutions the industrys largest 
trade group 
although the stock market hasnt declined since october it 
hasnt gone up much either a lot of consumers are rethinking what 
theyre doing with their money and parking some or all of it into 
thrifts and perhaps banks he said 
unlike the early months after the crash which saw an increase 
in deposits of 100000 and more the increase so far in 1988 has 
come in smaller accounts which are institutions least costly 
source of funds 
meanwhile in a separate report the bank board said interest 
rates for 30year fixedrate mortgages fell from 1048 percent in 
early february to 1034 percent in early march the lowest since 
last april 
rates on the most popular type of oneyear adjustable mortgages 
those with caps on how much the rate can change fell less sharply 
from 872 percent to 865 percent 
the bank board figures do not reflect the most recent nudge 
upward in interest rates according to the federal home loan 
mortgage corp 30year fixedrate mortgages have edged up from 
984 percent on feb 12 the low for this year to 1005 percent on 
april 1 this survey did not include addon fees known as points 
which are included in the bank board averages 
mortgage lending by sampls rose slightly to 135 billion in 
february from 131 billion in january which was the lowest level 
since february 1985 the bank board said

teams of weather scientists will be cruising 
the pacific ocean over the next four months but its all for 
research 
heat and moisture from the oceans have a major impact on weather 
and climate the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
scientists want to learn more about how the air and water interact 
the first leg of the work is under way with the team sailing 
from dutch harbor alaska to samoa 
scientists are measuring the amounts of carbon dioxide carbon 
monoxide methane and other gases in pacific surface waters and the 
overlying air 
similar sampling was done in 1983 and the new study will allow 
comparison of the changes in these gases 
concentrations of the gases in the upper atmosphere can prevent 
heat from sunlight from being reflected out into space possibly 
leading to a warming known as the greenhouse effect according to 
tim bates of the pacific marine environmental laboratory in seattle 
at the same time the scientists will sample sulfur gases and 
look for aerosols in the sea and air 
these chemicals could increase the reflective power of the 
clouds over the ocean reducing the amount of sunlight and heat 
reaching the surface 
at samoa a second team of scientists will board the research 
ship oceanographer to begin a study of the periodic changes in 
ocean temperature and air pressure known as the el nino phenomenon 
the el nino has been blamed for unusual changes in weather 
around the world but scientists are not sure how these effects 
occur 
during a cruise from samoa to panama via honolulu they will 
measure air pressure and ocean currents and temperature all 
factors which appear to play a role 
in addition they will perform maintenance on an array of moored 
and drifting sensors which collect weather data and send the 
information back via satellite 
joining the noaa meteorologists on the first leg of the trip are 
scientists from the university of washington washington state 
university and the university of hawaii 
on the second leg will be researchers from the university of 
washington scripps institute of oceanography university of south 
florida and monterey bay aquarium research institute

white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater today described as a throwaway remark a comment by 
president reagan indicating approval of the notion of pardoning 
indicted former aide oliver north 
reagan did not say that he would pardon former white house aides 
or others accused in the irancontra affair but after hearing a 
proposal for pardons he did say i like the sound of those 
words said one congressman quoted in the washington post 
another congressman quoted reagan as saying i like hearing 
what you said after rep henry j hyde suggested the president 
should pardon north and former national security adviser john m 
poindexter at the end of reagans term 
hyde rill suggested the pardons be signed during ceremonies 
at the vietnam veterans memorial in washington according to the 
post 
during a briefing for reporters at this seaside resort not far 
from reagans ranch in the santa ynez mountains fitzwater was 
questioned about the presidents intentions 
i was there at that meeting and henry hyde said he hoped that 
north would be pardoned and the president told him he is not 
discussing pardons at this time the spokesman said 
and then there was some throwaway line and i didnt give it 
any significance then or at this time fitzwater said i dont 
believe you should make any assumptions or conclusions on the basis 
of a throwaway remark 
fitzwater said he could not remember reagans precise words but 
he did not dispute the quote attributed to reagan 
i have raised the issue with the president four or five times 
and every time he has said he wasnt discussing pardons the 
spokesman said 
hydes proposal and reagans response reportedly were made march 
22 during the presidents appearance before the house republican 
conference a closed meeting attended by 160 of the 177 gop house 
members 
the post said the congressmen who quoted the president asked not 
to be identified since it was a closed session 
the post quoted one congressman as saying he felt the 
presidents message was unmistakable and if i had been ollie and 
witnessed that i would have been pretty upbeat 
the meeting occurred six days after north and poindexter along 
with arms dealers richard v secord and albert a hakim pleaded 
innocent to federal criminal charges in the sale of arms to iran 
and the diversion of money to contra rebels fighting the government 
of nicaragua 
three days later reagan predicted poindexter and north would be 
found innocent because i dont think they were guilty of any 
lawbreaking or any crime speaking at a seminar sponsored by the 
center for the study of the presidency reagan called the 
irancontra affair the socalled scandal and said he still 
considered north a hero 
the president later said he was referring to norths combat in 
vietnam 
fitzwater said a day after the indictments that there had been 
no discussion of pardons we dont discuss pardons period 
fitzwater said 
chief of staff howard h baker later said reagan would not 
consider pardons until after north and poindexter are tried 
fitzwater said today he had not been aware of bakers remarks

chinese authorities have arrested 203 people 
for illegal hunting of the endangered giant panda and recovered 146 
pelts representing about one in seven of all pandas alive at the 
last count the world wildlife fund said wednesday 
these are shocking revelations william reilly president of 
the funds us affiliate said in a statement the situation 
appears to be worsening for the panda with the march to 
extinction more advanced than previously believed and hunting the 
greatest threat 
reilly said it was the first time china had released such 
detailed statistics 
chinas last public estimates of the panda population were made 
in 1976 about 1000 animals another survey is under way this 
year and results have been announced only for the wolong nature 
preserve 145 animals in 1976 72 now 
chinese authorities up to now have said poaching at been 
controlled though the possibility of the death penalty for 
poachers was announced last fall the fund said 
forestry minister gao dezhan announced the arrest statistics in 
february he reportedly said 150 people still were sought in 
connection with an investigation into poaching and fur trading in 
sichuan province in western china where almost all pandas live 
twentysix people have been sentenced to prisons terms ranging 
from a year to life dezhan was quoted as saying 
some pandas are believed caught in snares set for another 
endangered species the asian musk deer whose oil is valued in 
traditional asian medicine 
panda furs fetch high prices when smuggled to hong kong or japan 
spokesman ken cook said a fund representative chris elliott 
saw accounts of dezhans speech in a beijing newspaper on feb 27 
but had been traveling and unable to confirm the figures with 
chinese officials until recently 
the panda is a shy mammal that looks like a blackandwhite bear 
but is believed by many zoologists not all to be closely 
related to the raccoon it has been known to be under severe strain 
as its forest habitat retreated under farming pressure 
the panda eats only certain kinds of bamboo found in the forest 
so little was known about the panda that it was not classified 
as an endangered species until 1984 
the fund said it was renewing its ferbuary request to the us 
fish and wildlife service to deny import permits for shortterm 
exhibitions of pandas in atlanta cincinnati detroit and toledo 
this year 
david klinger spokesman for the service said applications had 
been received only from organizations in detroit and toledo 
the service he said will make no decisions on the permits 
until it gets information from the chinese government on whether 
the exhibitions affect the population in the wild and the captive 
breeding population in chinese zoos and whether rental payments 
from the exhibitions are being used to benefit the species

some 800 marines are going to 
panama for training exercises but the troop movement is not 
related to the us military security buildup prompted by panamas 
political turmoil the white house said today 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the marines from 
camp pendleton near san diego will begin arriving in panama friday 
at an american jungle operations training center 
this should not be confused with the current security 
enhancement in panama involving the deployment of about 1300 
troops earlier this week fitzwater said 
he said the 800 marines are scheduled to take three weeks of 
training but did not say whether a similar number is leaving 
panama 
theres a constant turnover of training exercises he said 
they will be there for three weeks and then they will come out 
the only reason we announced this was so we could emphasize 
that it was not related to the security buildup in the us 
southern command 
administration officials are increasingly frustrated with the 
failure of us economic sanctions to dislodge panamanian strongman 
manuel antonio noriega the presidents national security adviser 
said tuesday 
lt gen colin powell briefing reporters during reagans 
vacation near here would not rule out the possibility of sending 
more american troops to panama beyond the additional 1300 
dispatched this week as the united states considers new steps to 
force out noriega 
powell would not say how long us officials would wait for the 
sanctions to work 
powell said the administration continues to weigh military 
political and economic options but he refused to comment on recent 
reports saying a possible noriega kidnapping had been discussed 
there has been a lot of speculation about positions that 
various parts of the administration hold on different subjects 
he said during tuesdays briefing but its really nothing until 
the president calls it 
noriega has clung to power despite the economic sanctions 
strikes in his country and the continued presence in hiding of 
deposed president eric arturo delvalle the general has been 
indicted by a federal grand jury in miami on drugtrafficking 
charges 
powell voiced frustration with the impact so far of us 
economic sanctions including a freeze on panamanian assets in this 
country and withholding of payments to the panama canal commission 
he said that while the punitive measures are having a telling 
effect on the panamanian economy they have not yet created 
enough pressure to remove general noriega it hasnt been 
sufficient to date 
powell said officials are studying the implications of invoking 
a law giving the us government emergency power to seize tax 
payments made to panama by american businesses with operations 
there 
we have to be cautious before you invoke ieepa international 
emergency economic powers act he said because it is a very 
powerful tool 
the staff back in washington is examining the pros and cons of 
invoking ieepa and if it is a sensible thing to do to continue to 
apply pressure on general noriega then we will provide that to the 
president for his consideration 
a senior administration official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said it may not be possible to persuade us businesses 
to withhold the tax payments voluntarily 
he said some businesses are having difficulty because of their 
need to operate in panama and because of what they believe are 
their legal obligations 
this official also said that invoking the emergency powers law 
could damage the panamanian economy beyond recovery in any 
postnoriega era saying we might regret it several months from 
now 
powell and state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said they 
had no evidence to back up a washington times report tuesday saying 
that an international marxist brigade of up to 1200 troops had 
been sent into panama late last month to protect noriega 
there are indications that there have been some cuban arms 
that have been flown into panama in recent weeks but i have no 
information supporting the presence of an international brigade

mikhail s gorbachev flew to the central asian 
city of tashkent under unusually tight security wednesday to meet 
with afghan leader najib apparently to work out a soviet troop 
withdrawal from afghanistan 
the official tass news agency reported that gorbachev left 
moscow in midafternoon but waited more than six hours before 
announcing that he would meet with najib no other details were 
provided and even soviet photographers were not allowed to cover 
the departure or arrival of gorbachevs plane 
also flying to tashkent was soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze who had been in kabul for the past four days to work 
out a plan to pull out soviet troops in the event that formal 
negotiations in geneva fail to produce an accord to end the 
10yearold war 
tass said shevardnadze and najib flew to tashkent after their 
talks but the wording suggested they traveled separately 
tashkent capital of the uzbek republic is about 450 miles 
north of kabul and about 1700 miles southeast of moscow 
the unusual meeting place apparently was a compromise on 
protocol which would make it unsuitable for najib who is head of 
state as well as party leader to be summoned to moscow for talks 
with gorbachev 
security concerns would prohibit gorbachev from traveling to 
afghanistan where guerrillas have used their ussupplied stinger 
missiles to shoot planes out of the sky 
guerrillas aided by pakistan and the united states have been 
fighting the kremlinbacked kabul government since an april 1978 
revolution brought communists to power in the moslem state 
the current round of the unmediated geneva talks which began 
on march 2 has been stalled by a disagreement between negotiators 
for afghanistan and pakistan which represents the insurgents at 
the talks over continued foreign aid to the warring sides 
the united staes contends that if the geneva accords call for an 
end to american military aid to the guerrillas when the soviet 
pullout begins the kremlin also should have to halt arms supplies 
to the kabul government 
soviet officials claim aid to afghanistan is a bilateral issue 
outside the range of the geneva talks 
while the americans are not officially represented at the 
negotiations their refusal to go along with the terms of a peace 
agreement could render it ineffective 
diego cordovez the un mediator at the geneva talks told 
reporters he is still awaiting a response from moscow and 
afghanistan on the aid issue progress at the latest round of talks 
has been slow but steady he said 
a member of the pakistani delegation said all parties agree 
they are near agreement while another diplomatic source 
cautioned it was a little premature to consider the superpower 
standoff settled both spoke on condition of anonymity 
us and pakistani officials said publicly tuesday that a 
resolution may be only days away 
shevardnadze flew to kabul on sunday and told tass upon arrival 
that the united states and pakistan had frustrated the geneva talks 
by insisting on symmetry the simultaneous cutoff by both 
superpowers of assistance to the afghan combatants 
in new delhi india on wednesday us defense secretary frank 
carlucci renewed the call for symmetry he told a news 
conference before flying to islamabad pakistan that the soviets 
have so far rejected the american proposal for such a moritorium 
we are exploring other options he said but gave no details 
gorbachev said feb 8 that if the geneva agreement was signed by 
march 15 soviet soldiers would start pulling out may 15 he also 
said the withdrawal could be completed within nine months with 
most of the soviet soldiers removed within three months 
while the deadline has passed soviet officials have asserted 
the troop pullout will begin this year anyway with or without a 
geneva agreement 
shevardnadze said sunday he would work out the details of the 
pullout focusing on afghan and soviet concerns in case the geneva 
process fails 
gorbachevs meeting with najib may have been necessary because 
of disagreements between the two governments over terms of the 
soviet withdrawal 
while najibs leadership is closely allied with the kremlin 
there are likely sharp differences over how and when to reduce the 
soviet fighting power while protecting afghan officials from a 
bloody takeover by the guerrillas 
soviet soldiers entered the war on dec 27 1979 and an 
estimated 115000 remain in afghanistan to help najibs army fight 
off the insurgents 
at a news conference earlier wednesday deputy foreign minister 
vladimir f petrovsky said that a pullout would begin two months 
after completion of an agreement in geneva but noted that the 
terms could be revised if the troops are to be withdrawn under a 
sovietafghan pact 
petrovsky refused to disclose details of the four days of talks 
between shevardnadze and najib 
while in islamabad carlucci is to meet with pakistan president 
mohammad zia ulhaq and prime minister mohammad khan junejo and 
discuss aid to the guerrillas on thursday he is to fly by 
helicopter to the khyber pass the gateway to afghanistan 185 miles 
west of islamabad

vanessa redgrave deserves damages from the boston 
symphony orchestra because its cancellation of her performances 
after receiving protest threats violated her civil rights her 
attorney told a federal appeals court wednesday 
a symphony attorney however countered that massachusetts law 
allowed the symphony to cancel the performances because of concerns 
over artistic integrity stemming from threatened distruptions by 
people opposed to redgrave for her support of the palestine 
liberation organization 
the arguments were heard by a full fivemember panel of the 1st 
us circuit court of appeals which must decide whether to order a 
lower court judge to consider awarding redgrave additional damages 
for civil rights violations 
the justices gave no indication of when they would rule 
redgrave did not attend the hearing 
a threemember appeals panel in october ruled the symphony 
violated redgraves rights in canceling the 1982 performances the 
court then granted the symphonys motion asking for full court 
review of the 21 decision 
the symphony had hired redgrave to narrate six performances of 
stravinskys oedipus rex at boston tanglewood in western 
massachusetts and new yorks carnegie hall 
but it canceled the concerts after receiving letters and phone 
calls indicating there would be picketing and other protests 
because of redgraves support of the plo trial testimony also 
indicated symphony officials were warned that allowing redgrave to 
perform might cause it to lose some of its financial support from 
the jewish community 
in november 1984 a federal jury ruled the symphony had breached 
its contract with redgrave and awarded her the 27500 she was to 
have received for the performances plus 100000 in compensatory 
damages for work redgrave said she lost because of the action 
us district judge robert keeton threw out the 100000 award 
in february 1985 and ruled the symphony had not violated her civil 
rights the appeals court last october restored 12000 of that 
award the amount redgrave would have been paid for a broadway 
role she lost during the suit against the symphony 
at wednesdays hearing attorney daniel j kornstein said the 
symphony violated redgraves first amendment right of free speech 
in canceling a nonpolitical performance because of her political 
views 
its the public in deciding whether or not to purchase 
tickets which will determine the artistic intregrity in deciding 
whether to come or not kornstein argued 
but symphony attorney robert e sullivan argued that the 
protests would have prevented the symphony from presenting 
oedipus rex in the format it desired and that it has a first 
amendment right to decide what shows it will present 
this decision is at the core of what the first amendment is 
all about said sullivan who referred to language in 
massachusetts law that makes artistic integrity a valid defense in 
canceling a performance

democrat jesse jackson put the best face 
wednesday on his loss in the wisconsin presidential primary saying 
he has broadened his base with a dramatic increase in support 
from whites 
jackson also said the wisconsin victor michael dukakis has 
adopted his message because it has proven popular with voters 
you look at the basic message formation now even of our 
rival mr dukakis whose lead now is stop drugs what hes done 
about drugs his lead now is save jobs reinvest in america and 
thats the right message its the clear jackson message jackson 
said here arizona democrats hold caucuses on april 16 
jackson took heart from the estimated 25 percent of wisconsin 
white primary voters who exit polls said voted for him in most of 
the primaries to date he has drawn about 10 percent of the white 
vote 
when we look at the results we have an expanded support base 
from among whites a dramatic increase in support from whites 
strong support from inner city blacks he said when you look 
at the demographics of colorado and milwaukee we broke through in 
major ways a historic breakthrough our campaign continues to 
expand continues to grow 
jackson told reporters it is really premature to discuss what 
will happen in june if there is no clearcut delegate leader 
after the last primaries 
but he said his showings to date indicate he is the peoples 
choice 
of 40 contests that have been run now ive come in no 1 or 
no 2 in 30 of them and i have a 250000plus popular vote lead and 
so at this stage of the campaign i feel very good he said 
jacksons claim is based on primary plus caucus votes in 
primary votes alone dukakis holds a lead 
jackson signaled tuesday night that he planned to lay out more 
details of his policies after his vague statements drew criticism 
in recent weeks 
in tempe he outlined his plan for reducing the deficit and 
paying for the dream his program of more domestic spending 
he said 100 billion could be generated annually by 1993 to 
reduce the deficit and pay for new programs by freezing pentagon 
spending at current levels and increasing taxes on individuals and 
corporations 
he said the tax rate for richest taxpayers should rise from 28 
percent and 33 percent to 385 percent a move he said would affect 
the top 600000 taxpayers he said corporate taxes should move back 
to the 1970s level as a percentage of gross national product 
simply refusing to give the pentagon an automatic allowance 
for inflation would over the fiveyear period represent a 
10percent reduction in planned spending this freeze is consistent 
with keeping america strong he said 
he also listed other savings from changes in farm programs 
closing tax loopholes including a limit on business entertainment 
deductions and taxes to discourage mergers and speculation 
he said some have recently estimated the cost of jacksons 
proposals for increased domestic spending at 50 billion to 100 
billion a year some declaim that this is unimaginably large it 
is not he said

on a june day nearly 300 years ago two 
young women were hanged in salem village and by the end of the 
summer colonists had executed 13 women and seven men convicted of 
being witches 
now a sculptor is nearing completion of the first memorial 
honoring the victims of the salem witch hysteria of 1692 
tourists would ask me where the witch trial memorial was and i 
would have to say i dont know said artist yiannis 
stefanakis who began work on the statue in august 1986 then i 
found out there wasnt one i decided that after almost 300 years 
these unfortunate people should be remembered 
his 14foot bronze statue depicting three sisters accused of 
witchcraft is to be dedicated in october on gallows hill he is 
preparing the mold for bronze casting next month and memorial 
organizers are seeking contributions to cover the 300000 needed 
for foundry and mounting expenses 
the organizers also need city approval for use of the site 
stefanakis said he selected the sisters sarah cloyce mary 
esty and rebecca nurse as subjects for the statue because they 
embodied the irony of the witch trials most of those accused were 
wellestablished members of the community and devoted church goers 
and only those who confessed their guilt in court were spared 
nurse who was 71 when hanged in july 1692 was the only one of 
the accused witches to be excommunicated esty was hanged along 
with seven other people on sept 22 1692 the final day of the 
executions 
cloyce was awaiting execution but was reprieved and spent her 
life trying to vindicate her sisters reputations 
the witch hysteria began with innocent gatherings of young girls 
fascinated by the mystical lore of tituba a caribbean slave of a 
salem clergyman two sisters were so aroused by the clandestine 
meetings that they would cry and shake uncontrollably other girls 
ages 13 to 20 began to imitate the behavior to get attention 
asked to explain their affliction the girls began to accuse 
townspeople of witchcraft nearly 200 people including a minister 
and the wife of the governor were charged 
curiously tituba and others who confessed were spared only 
those who steadfastly proclaimed innocence were hanged one man was 
pressed to death with rocks 
the salem witch trials were not unique there were others in 
the colonies and england said anne farnam president of the 
essex institute in salem which houses the original trial records 
but salem was by far the worst episode 
farnam said a large witch trial memorial proposed in 1903 was 
abandoned because of cost and lingering guilt 
there were still some negative feelings about the trials 
said farnam there are even still some who dont want to 
acknowledge the trials but after 300 years weve loosened up a 
bit 
the essex institute keeps a log of descendants of the accused 
some of whom are expected to attend the statue unveiling 
we wish there were more artifacts from the period but i 
really dont think they wanted to save anything said patty 
macleod director of the salem witch museum i think the statue 
will serve well if only as a reminder that nothing like this 
happens again

gov bob martinez is willing to spend 
more on aids but he also wants carriers who continue sexual 
activity locked up to keep them from spreading the deadly disease 
the time has come to quarantine those whose character and 
conduct are a clear threat to society martinez told lawmakers 
tuesday in his state of the state address aids carriers who 
refuse to stop spreading this fatal disease should no more be 
allowed to roam free than criminals armed with a deadly weapon 
the governors press secretary jon peck said wednesday that 
martinez hasnt finalized his proposal on detaining aids victims 
but the department of health and rehabilitative services under the 
governors supervision is pushing an effort to counsel aids 
carriers and protect the public 
the hrs proposal is modeled after a program in minnesota 
department spokesman ray wise said 
what do you do with the people who wont stop spreading 
aids asked wise we want them in a facility that can provide 
counseling and where necesary the medical treatment they need 
if you just arrest them and throw them in jail youre giving 
up on them 
martinez has called for spending 20 million this year to fight 
aids which is expected to infect 32000 floridians by 1991 more 
than 4000 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have been 
reported in florida since 1981 
there are millions and millions of dollars for the thousands 
of aids patients who need help said peck but there is also a 
small amount for that very small but very dangerous group of aids 
patients who knowingly go out and actively spread the disease 
that money would be used to renovate a wing of a state 
tuberculosis hospital in lantana to house about 26 aids patients 
hrs already has funds for a group home for teenagers with aids and 
the department has identified a small facility near orlando that 
would house six carriers 
bob kunst leader of the miamibased cure aids now said threats 
to isolate carriers drive them underground rather than motivate 
them to seek testing for the disease 
the state already has a law permitting aids carriers to be 
quarantined the first time it was used was last june when hrs 
obtained a court order to have a 14yearold pensacola boy locked 
in a mental ward 
that action drew objections from national gay and civil rights 
leaders and hrs backed down and asked the judge to lift the order 
nearly two weeks later 
the agency however used juvenile laws to remove the boy from 
the custody of his mother placing him first in a community mental 
health center and then with a foster family 
under the latest hrs proposals police would be responsible for 
arresting aids carriers and the courts would be responsible for 
certifying they are a public health risk said wise 
a firsttime offender would be placed on probation with limited 
activities and restricted associations after a second arrest the 
carrier would be placed in an aroundtheclock supervised living 
arrangement similar to a halfway house 
finally wise said incorrigibles would be committed but in a 
humane and dignified environment

the quakers who founded friends hospital 175 
years ago chose a site on the outskirts of philadelphia so the 
mentally ill could live and work in freedom from prying eyes and 
barred windows 
that was part of the philosophy the quakers led by thomas 
scattergood believed in when they opened the asylum for persons 
deprived of the use of their reason the institution is observing 
its anniversary this week 
the moral treatment of the mentally ill was considered 
revolutionary at a time when the insane were put in chains in 
basements or on display for public amusement 
today about every institution espouses moral treatment 
said judith kelius the hospitals coordinator of community 
relations it was something that was accepted much more widely 
after friends opened 
the hospital was the first institution in the united states 
exclusively for the mentally ill which was not under government 
auspices 
believing that theres that of god in every person the 
quakers treatment included giving each patients as much 
responsibility as possiblee and and giving each an occupation to 
increase selfesteem 
just because youre sick doesnt mean youre useless said 
james delaplane todays director of the facility 
the second nonquaker director of the 11 who have served the 
hospital delaplane said 70 percent of the board of managers and 
corporation members are quakers according to bylaws 
it was set up to be society of friends dominated to assure the 
philosophy and principles were adhered to he explained 
scattergood founded the hospital after visiting the retreat at 
york england a hospital for the mentally ill founded by quaker 
william tuke 
thomas scattergood quite likely was a depressant himself 
delaplane said noting descriptions of him as a melancholiac 
person 
the original building built in 1817 and used as administrative 
offices now gave each patient a room of his own with a window ms 
kelius said planners for the building included a committee on light 
and air 
that tradition continues each patient has his or her own room 
though the bathroom is shared with one other patient 
in 175 years the hospital has added several buildings the 
greystone house once the directors residence houses 13 patients 
with longterm psychiatric illness in a program to teach daily 
living skills 
at the turn of the century the hygeia building was constructed 
for hydrotherapy a treatment similar to a whirlpool with the 
person wrapped in a towellike material according to delaplane 
treatments that once included purging bloodletting and spinning 
a patient while seated in a chair were used at friends hospital 
but have been discarded 
the medical approach changes with the vogue in medicine 
delaplane said the moral treatment has not changed 
patients have two hours daily of activity therapy which may 
include occupational or recreational therapy creative arts and 
horticulture 
the first year friends hospital had 19 patients in 1982 the 
hospital expanded to 192 beds now a day program with 24 people 
allows patients to undergo the same treatment as regular patients 
but leave the hospital at night 
at first the quakers only wanted to admit patients of their 
faith and people who had not been ill for an extended period of 
time after finding that there were not enough patients to fill 
beds they opened up the facility to all faiths and longterm 
illnesses 
the 100acre site of friends hospital in north philadelphia is 
no longer rural but the hospital is still surrounded by open 
areas trees and gardens 
with the development of the surrounding area weve always had 
a buffer delaplane explained the fact of the open space has 
been a community asset

a newspaper that published a prostalin letter and 
subsequently came under fire appeared wednesday to be atoning for 
its sin by reprinting a pravda article that criticized its action 
sovietskaya rossiya the official daily of the russian 
republics party and government published the unusual 
selfcriticism on its entire second page the newspaper did not 
make any independent comment on the criticism originally published 
tuesday in the communist party newspaper pravda 
sovietskaya rossiya also received a scolding from other soviet 
journalists 
grigory y baklanov editor in chief of the monthly literary 
journal znamya accused the editors of sovietskaya rossiya of 
lagging behind the times in publishing the letter advocating 
stalinism on march 13 appearing at a news conference on 
disarmament baklanov pointed to a clock that was two hours slow 
weve got a clock in front of us it shows i dont know why 
half past nine probably theres something wrong with that clock 
and that clock was used apparently in the article of sovietskaya 
rossiya 
baklanov praised pravda for setting the record straight 
its moral position is flawless its philosophical position is 
deep and serious it reflects revolutionary thinking he said 
pravda in an editorial sharply condemned those advocating the 
repressive ways of stalin that led to the deaths or exile of many 
thousands of people and the administrativecommand methods of 
economic management that discouraged local initiative 
the daily said the letter in sovietskaya rossiya written by a 
leningrad teacher was an attempt little by little to revise 
party decisions it said sovietskaya rossiyas publication of the 
letter worked against soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs programs 
of perestroika or restructuring of society 
gorbachev acknowledged perestroika and his policy of 
glasnost more openness have generated controversy 
some are panicking there are people who think everything is 
collapsing just as in the beginning of this century matter 
vanished in the perceptions of some people as a result of new 
discoveries in physics now it seems to some that socialism is 
vanishing gorbachev told west german socialist leader willy 
brandt on tuesday according to the tass news agency 
moscow news a weekly that has been in the forefront of 
glasnost also joined the chorus of condemnation of sovietskaya 
rossiya it said opponents of perestroika were not bothered by 
the fate of the country the fate of socialism in the years of 
repression or stagnation which brought the country to the 
threshold of a moral ideological and economic crisis 
the comments appeared in this weeks edition of the newspaper 
put out by the union of soviet societies of friendship and cultural 
relations with foreign countries and novosti press agency 
in addition to a brief editorial moscow news also published a 
letter from a muscovite condemning the approach of firmness 
advocated in the sovietskaya rossiya letter it also reported that 
anonymous typewritten leaflets have been found in mailboxes warning 
that perestroika will lead to economic catastrophe and social 
shock and then to enslavement of the country by imperialistic 
governments

elderly americans with low incomes would be 
burdened unreasonably by any energy tax increase that did not make 
special provisions to shield them two advocacy groups said 
wednesday 
a report commissioned by the villers advocacy associates and the 
national council of senior citizens said one or more energy taxes 
is likely to develop strong political support in the push to 
reduce the federal deficit 
the report urged that those favoring higher energy taxes 
consider the impact that these energy taxes would have on the 
poor and on other americans living on fixed incomes 
unlike those of us who may have become casual about our use of 
energy the elderly poor cannot readily adopt conservation 
strategies because for the most part they are already conserving 
wherever and however they can the report said 
the report based on census and energy department data said 
about 58 million elderly households with average annual incomes of 
5300 have only 500 a year left in socalled discretionary income 
after paying existing housing food and home energy costs 
the average lowincome elderly household must pay for 
clothing medicine transportation and other necessities on a 
budget of less than 10 a week it said so a seemingly modest 
energy tax that might be a minor annoyance to most consumers could 
be a severe shock to the elderly poor 
for affluent americans a new energy tax would be the 
equivalent of a luxury excise tax mildly irritating but 
bearable but for the elderly poor such a tax would be a 
calamity the report said 
if some sort of energy tax is enacted and if that legislation 
fails to provide special protections for the poor millions of our 
neediest citizens especially lowincome seniors will suffer as 
a result said ronald f pollack director of the villers 
organization an energy tax without low income protections will 
be devastating to millions of persons 
lawrence t smedley director of the senior citizens council 
said clearly any acrosstheboard energy taxes would leave the 
poorest citizens with nothing but losing options

eleven us senators met with soviet defense 
experts and scientists wednesday and told them the issue of human 
rights takes precedence over negotiations on conventional arms in 
europe one of the senators said 
the delegation from the senate committee on energy and natural 
resources led by sen bennett johnston dla met with deputy 
politburo member pyotr demichev colgen nikolai chervov and 
academician yevgeny velikhov for discussions centered on security 
and improving trust between the two superpowers 
a tass news agency account of the meeting said the soviet 
participants outlined proposals for spurring the viennabased talks 
on conventional arms reductions but said the us government had 
already rejected the ideas 
we told them there is no support in congress for beginning 
conventional arms control until the meeting in vienna finishes with 
good results said sen timothy wirth dcolo 
he referred to the european human rights forum that has been 
unable to produce a plan for improving individual freedoms in the 
35 member nations including the united states and the soviet union 
but wirth said the senators found a greater willingness on the 
soviets part to work toward improvements in superpower relations 
and further arms control measures 
tass said demichev claimed a treaty eliminating half of both 
nations strategic nuclear weapons could be completed in time for 
the next summit between president reagan and mikhail s gorbachev 
given mutual desire 
however soviet officials have conceded privately that time is 
running short before the may 29june 2 summit in moscow and major 
differences persist on the issue of reagans spacebased missile 
defense system 
the soviets contend the project violates the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty signed by both nations demichev reiterated the 
kremlin line that any pact on strategic weapons cuts would have to 
adhere to the abm agreement 
velikhov restated the kremlins desire to jointly work out 
measures for monitoring and verifying the disarmament process 
according to the tass report 
wirth said the delegation told the soviets they would like to 
see detailed proposals on how they propose to ensure compliance in 
the event an accord is signed in the future banning nuclear testing 
or use of commercial space vehicles to bring weapons into the 
cosmos 
the other senators accompanying johnston and wirth are kent

processing said british radio talkshow host sally masterson as 
she met dick ferry and his wife carol after a transatlantic 
flight arranged by the decatur newspaper 
thats the phrase that inspired ferry an education professor 
to write a feb 4 newspaper column about his infatuation with the 
talking teller 
the item intrigued the decatur herald amp reviews editors who 
tracked down ms masterson and arranged for her trip after deciding

michael dukakis basked in the glow of his unexpectedly strong 
wisconsin primary victory on wednesday as he and his democratic 
presidential rivals pointed toward new york a cauldron of 
political intrigue if there ever was one 
from campaign rival jesse jackson to party chairman paul kirk 
dukakis won accolades on his wisconsin landslide it puts dukakis 
in the catbird seat said former party chairman john white a 
jackson supporter 
dukakis shunned any such talk likening the race to a 15round 
boxing match that will be decided by a decision rather than a 
knockout my job is to go out now and do the very best i can in 
new york and pennsylvania and ohio and those other very important 
primaries he said as he campaigned in new york city 
there were political aftershocks on the republican side of the 
race 
vice president george bush the certain nominee met privately 
with sen bob dole once his strongest rival 
bush said he envisioned a role for dole in the general election 
in which the kansan would work as much as he possibly has time to 
give a lot of its here and a lot of it i hope will be around the 
country dole said they talked about getting george elected in 
november 
dole also met with former television evangelist pat robertson 
who remains in the gop race and said we talked about how 
pat might be helpful in senate and house races and state 
legislative races build this party from bottom up 
wisconsins democratic runnerup jackson campaigned in arizona 
and pronounced himself more than satisfied with his showing thus 
far forty contests have been run now he said ive come in 
no 1 or no 2 in 30 of them 
jackson claimed credit for changing the terms of the campaign 
debate noting that other candidates have begun to address issues 
such as the fight against drugs and securing jobs for workers 
sen albert gore jr who finished a distant third in wisconsin 
and now faces a makeorbreak test in new york pronounced himself 
the underdog new york state has always been friendly to 
underdogs he said 
sen paul simon made plans to suspend his campaign on thursday 
following his fourth place finish in wisconsin but was expected to 
remain in the race as an inactive candidate in hopes of gaining 
additional delegates in his home state of illinois and elsewhere 
but congressional sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the illinois senator would not seek to participate in campaign 
debates scheduled in new york over the next two weeks 
intentionally or not simons decision to remain in the race 
does dukakis a favor in the delegate chase under party rules 
simon is entitled to 47 atlarge delegates from his home state of 
illinois jackson is entitled to 13 and dukakis none a simon 
withdrawal would automatically shift his 47 delegates to jacksons 
column and thus give him at least a temporary lead in the national 
delegate competition 
dukakis holds a lead currently in the delegate count 74055 to 
70455 for jackson gore has 3948 and simon 1705 
with 225 delegates at stake on april 19 the new york primary 
represents one of the most important tests of the year dukakis 
leads jackson in the public opinion polls in the state with gore 
trailing and a victory in new york would firmly install him as the 
frontrunner in the democratic race 
the nominee will be determined in new york and pennsylvania 
said rachelle horowitz political director of the amnerican 
federation of teachers and a member of the democratic national 
committee i think we have a twoperson race dukakis and 
jackson and we have a frontrunner the likelihood is well have a 
nominee and not a brokered convention 
but gore has signed up media consultant david garth a sometime 
adviser to gov mario cuomo and has decided to spend 1 million on 
television advertising in new york in an attempt to woo the large 
jewish vote in the state gore already has criticized dukakis for 
his views on the middle east and has taken on jackson on the same 
topic 
new york mayor ed koch entered the fray last week when he said 
jews have got to be crazy to vote for jackson koch has spoken 
warmly of gore in the past although he has not endorsed him 
the democratic partys most talked about noncandidate cuomo 
also figures in the primary campaign the governor has yet to issue 
an endorsement although he has been courted for months by all the 
contenders and there were discussions with the dukakis campaign 
several weeks ago 
mario and i are friends were colleagues were neighbors 
he said in a television interview id love to have his 
endorsement but i resopect that decision and well just see what 
happens

president reagan was giving merely 
a throwaway comment when he made a remark interpreted by some 
congressmen as a sign he might pardon former aides oliver north and 
john poindexter the white house said wednesday 
i dont think its safe to make any conclusions about the 
presidents attitude about pardons white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater told reporters as reagan vacationed at his mountaintop 
ranch 
fitzwater confirmed that the president at a closed meeting with 
republican members of the house on march 22 had been urged by rep 
henry hyde rill to pardon north and poindexter who have been 
indicted on felony charges in the irancontra affair 
hyde suggested reagan sign pardons in the final days of his term 
next january possibly in a ceremony at the vietnam veterans 
memorial in washington 
hydes comments were greeted by applause from other gop 
congressmen reagan said i like the sound of those words 
according to one unidentified congressman quoted by the washington 
post another lawmaker recalled the president as saying i like 
hearing what you said 
some lawmakers have taken reagans comment as a hint that he 
will pardon the two former national security aides but fitzwater 
played down the significance of the remarks 
he said reagan told them he was not discussing pardons 
period and then he had some throwaway line which was similar to 
the remark quoted by the congressmen 
i gave them no significance at the time i dont give them any 
significance now certainly youve heard the president say much 
stronger things than that in terms of his feelings about north and 
poindexter the spokesman said 
he added i dont believe you should make any assumptions or 
conclusions on the basis of that throwaway comment 
emphasizing his point fitzwater said its been three weeks 
since reagans comment there couldnt have been too much youd 
have had 40 congressmen running out of the room grabbing the 
cameras like you cant believe 
fitzwater said i have raised the issue of pardons with the 
president four or five times myself and ive heard it raised by 
others and every time the president says the same thing im not 
discussing pardons 
however reagan has made several comments that have fueled 
speculation about pardons answering a question from a student last 
month he expressed the conviction that north and poindexter are 
going to be found innocent because i dont think they were guilty 
of any lawbreaking or any crime 
reagan said i still think ollie is a hero days later he 
qualified his remark about heroism saying he was referring to 
combat honors north had won in vietnam 
white house chief of staff howard baker has said the president 
is committed to seeing that the legal system operates and i do 
not anticipate that hell address the pardon issue until it does 
fitzwater declined to interpret what baker meant about seeing 
the legal system operate i dont know he said ive not 
heard the president say that 
north and poindexter along with arms dealers richard v secord 
and albert a hakim have pleaded innocent to federal criminal 
charges in the sale of arms to iran and the diversion of money to 
contra rebels fighting the leftist government of nicaragua

secretary of state george p shultz who is 
cautiously expanding contacts with some of moscows staunchest 
allies will hold talks with the highestranking east german and 
communist bulgarian to visit washington officials said wednesday 
hermann axen a member of the ruling east german politburo will 
meet shultz on may 3 during a threeday visit to washington the 
us and east german sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the meeting was arranged after axen was invited to give a 
lecture at the johns hopkins university institute for contemporary 
german studies on may 4 
although axen holds no office in the east german government he 
is the top international affairs officer of the communist socialist 
unity party which controls government policy 
andrey k lukanov bulgarian minister for foreign economic 
development will meet shultz during an april 2526 visit to 
washington lukanov a former deputy premier whose post was created 
in a recent government reorganization will be the first bulgarian 
cabinet minister to visit washington since world war ii 
since 1984 the state department has gingerly increased its 
overtures to soviet bloc countries not with great hopes of wooing 
them from moscows domination but to chip away wherever possible at 
hardline human rights and economic policies 
in visits over the past two years deputy secretary of state 
john c whitehead has told leaders in east germany czechoslovakia 
poland bulgaria romania and hungary that us eagerness to expand 
commercial ties will depend on their willingness to improve human 
rights conditions 
the us source said that during axens talks state department 
officials will renew pleas for better human rights performance 
notably in the realm of religion in what the official described as 
a mixed bag of actions east germany last year allowed two 
massive religious assemblies and the east german jewish community 
was allowed to install its first rabbi since 1967 
in recent weeks however there has been a crackdown on 
environmental groups affiliated with churches the official said 
axen and shultz also will discuss the two countries effort to 
settle financial claims by americans whose property on east german 
territory was taken during and after world war ii the claims total 
more than 70 million 
a us effort to get other countries to do more to stop 
terrorism and the flow of drugs is another likely topic the 
official said 
an east german diplomat said the main intention of these talks 
will be to promote the relationship between both countries and 
contribute to a further buildup of the relationship 
the us and east german officials said they doubted there would 
be serious talk about a visit to the united states by east german 
leader erich honecker as was reported in a west german magazine 
honecker is known to be interested in such a visit but it isnt 
ripe for discussion the us official said 
in talks with the bulgarian official the state department is 
expected to reassert requests for better human rights policies 
notably toward bulgarias sizable turkish and islamic minority 
bulgaria wants to expand trade with the united states beyond the 
current 130 million level before he leaves the united states on 
may 2 lukanov is expected to call for improved commercial ties 
during talks at the us chamber of commerce in washington and in 
meetings in los angeles san francisco chicago and new york

with jury selection almost completed 
opening arguments were scheduled thursday in the cocaine trial of 
john zaccaro jr 
after three days of closely questioning 30 potential jurors 
prosecutors and defense lawyers prepared to narrow the group to the 
12 people who will decide whether zaccaro is guilty of illegally 
selling a regulated drug 
the state maintains that zaccaro then a student at middlebury 
college sold a quartergram of cocaine to an undercover police 
officer two years ago 
the two sides have closely questioned the potential jurors 
trying to determine any biases stemming from the publicity given 
the case and from the fact that zaccaro now 24 is the son of 
former vice presidential candidate geraldine ferraro 
only one juror has been dismissed for acknowleging that the 
prominence of ferraro could affect his view of the case 
many of the potential jurors said they discounted what they had 
read because of a distrust of the press 
they have a tendency to present people as guilty just because 
they have been charged said donald cioffi on wednesday 
warren taylor of chittenden said he was not a firm believer in 
what the media prints 
another potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had 
picked on ferraros family while she was a candidate in 1984 
and she thought the attacks had carried over to zaccaro after his 
arrest 
ferraro and her husband john zaccaro sr have been present for 
the three days of questioning in the cramped chambers of the 
presiding judge 
police said they began their investigation of zaccaro after 
hearing he was dealing drugs he is charged with selling the 
cocaine to an undercover police officer 
defense lawyer charles tetzlaff has asked potential jurors if 
they would be willing to find someone innocent based on a technical 
defect in the states case the defense is expected to try to prove 
that zaccaro was entrapped by the police and that the police 
singled him out because of his famous mother

boeing co must justify to a jury its 
requirement that test and training pilots stop flying at age 60 and 
cant rely on a similar limit for commercial pilots a federal 
appeals court ruled wednesday 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals reinstated an age 
discrimination suit by the us equal employment opportunity 
commission against the seattlebased aircraft company 
according to the court boeing has 41 pilots who train other 
pilots and 24 who make test flights the company set its age60 
limit in 1980 forcing some pilots into layoffs or early 
retirement the eeoc said 
us district judge barbara rothstein dismissed the eeoc suit 
citing the federal aviation administrations longstanding rule 
requiring pilots of large commercial passenger planes to stop 
flying at 60 she said the faa rule was based on safety concerns 
that applied equally to boeing 
the appeals court said a jury must decide on the eeocs claim 
that it would be practical to examine pilots over 60 for 
disabilities rather than automatically disqualifying them under 
federal law the court said boeing must prove that individual 
testing is impractical 
the faa rule applies only to certain commercial pilots and the 
agency has expressly refused to apply the rule to other types of 
piliots said chief judge james browning in the 30 decision 
it may be that the age60 rule reflects an faa decision to 
resolve any doubts about the necessity for an age qualification in 
favor of the substantial number of passengers carried by the 
airlines covered by the rule browning said he said a court 
cannot assume that the same considerations would make an age60 
limit a business necessity for boeing 
browning who is 69 and recently announced his intention to step 
down as chief judge but remain an active member of the court said 
judge rothstein did not consider eeoc evidence of new scientific 
testing methods accurately predicting individual loss of function 
he said rothstein also disregarded evidence that boeing employed 
pilots over 60 without incident before 1980 that the navy had 
rescinded its age60 limit for pilots and that boeing and airlines 
have used elaborate testing procedures to allow pilots to resume 
flying after being grounded for alcoholism or heart disease 
there was also evidence that some of the work done by boeing 
pilots such as flight training was less stressful and dangerous 
than the jobs of commercial pilots browning said

ticket twice then mislaid the keys to his safety deposit box 
where he had thought his treasure was safe

relatives ransacked it searching for the misplaced ticket 
the retired shoestore owner lost the ticket the first time soon 
after learning jan 6 that he had won the prize 
the family tore apart his home for four days and finally found 
the ticket in a pillow 
the place was pillaged again for a week when he forgot his 
second hiding place until a moment that some interpreted as 
divine intervention the ticket was found in santiagos bible 
santiago put it into the safety deposit box he was on the verge 
of shelling out 75 for a duplicate set of keys when he found the 
originals in a safe place at the back of his closet 
finally santiagos wife carmen sewed a small cloth pouch for 
the ticket and he bound it to his arm using adhesive tape enough 
to make it look like a cast he kept it there until he collected 
his prize march 31

a leading soviet expert on afghanistan said 
wednesday that the prokremlin regime in kabul may survive the 
withdrawal of the red army but that the lives of its leaders are 
in the hands of the almighty 
in a remarkably pessimistic public assessment for a soviet yuri 
gankovsky said the kabul regime controls about 30 percent of 
afghanistan including most administrative centers that tribal 
leaders control about 30 percent and that the islamic guerrillas 
known as mujahedeen control just over 30 percent 
the complicated balance of power hampers predictions of what 
will happen when and if the red army pulls out said gankovsky 
although some guerrillas have close ties with the fundamentalist 
moslem government in iran gankovsky said my impression is that 
an islamic republic in afghanistan is impossible because tribal 
leaders are so strong 
many us analysts believe that the prokremlin government will 
collapse immediately after a soviet pullout and that regime 
officials who do not leave will be targets of revenge from the 
families of the estimated 1 million afghans who were killed or the 
5 million afghans driven into exile during the war 
individual acts of revenge may take place gankovsky said 
but i hope that a blood bath will not take place 
it is impossible to predict the future of najib the leader 
of the kabul regime he said but we have the impression that the 
regime of the peoples democratic party may survive najib also 
known as najibullah uses a single name 
as for for the fate of najib and other leaders gankovsky said 
their life is in the hands of the almighty 
gankovsky in a lecture at the johns hopkins school of advanced 
international studies declined to speculate how many members of 
the current government might flee 
but he said that some middlesized leaders in kabul want to 
emigrate to the soviet union and other countries that is their 
private business 
gankovsky who retired last fall as head of the middle and near 
east section of the oriental institutes section of the soviet 
academy of sciences said he was unable to comment directly on 
stalled un negotiations designed to end the war 
the soviets say that us covert aid to the guerrillas should 
end within 60 days after an agreement is signed but pakistan 
representing the interests of the united states and the guerrillas 
insists that kremlin aid to kabul stop at the same time 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev flew to the soviet central 
asian city of tashkent on wednesday to meet with najib for talks 
thought to center on plans for a withdrawal of soviet troops even 
if the un talks collapse 
under the soviet system experts such as gankovsky not only 
write scholarly works but are asked to prepare classified reports 
for the key decisionmaking body on foreign relations the 
international department of the central committee secretariat 
gankovsky declined to say what advice he has the kremlin about 
afghanistan explaining that a lecture is not a confessional 
he denied that the soviet union plans to annex any part of 
afghanistan 
and he avoided direct comment on speculation that soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan signalled an end to the socalled 
brezhnev doctrine invoked in the past to justify military 
intervention to prop up communist regimes in such nations such as 
hungary and czechoslovakia 
instead gankovsky clamed that afghanistan never had a communist 
government 
although najib and his colleagues represent a leftist faction 
within the ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan said 
gankovsky there are not any communists among them 
the biggest part of them are afghan nationalists they are not 
communists they are not socialists he said drawing a fine line 
which was challenged vocally by some afghan emigres in the audience 
the chances that a prokremlin regime would prevail in 
afghanistan are bolstered by the high rate of party membership 75 
percent among military and police officials and by the large 
number of afghans 400000 employed by the state he said

michael dukakis impressive wisconsin victory 
stirred cautious optimism among democrats on wednesday that the 
race for their partys presidential nomination would end without a 
bloodbath at the national convention in july 
the massachusetts governor had moved on to the next major 
battleground new york even as wisconsin voters were giving him a 
20point win over his chief rival jesse jackson dukakis was 
banking on another victory in the april 19 new york primary to 
widen his lead in the race 
dukakis has rallied from his defeat in the michigan caucuses 
to win three straight states connecticut colorado and 
wisconsin said richard wiener the michigan democratic party 
chairman it certainly is a good sign for his campaign he has 
momentum as he goes into new york 
jacksons landslide victory in michigan following a strong 
showing in illinois had given the civil rights activist a claim to 
frontrunner status in the race 
the nominee will be determined in new york and pennsylvania 
said rachelle horowitz political director of the american 
federation of teachers and a member of the democratic national 
committee i think we have a twoperson race and we have a 
frontrunner the likelihood is well have a nominee and not a 
brokered convention 
former national party chairman john c white who has been 
advising jackson said the wisconsin result gives dukakis a good 
bump for new york it got his chin above water 
a long list of democrats have claimed momentum in the 
presidential nomination race none of them yet able to sustain it 
people like gary hart richard gephardt and paul simon had moments 
in the sun even albert gore jr and bruce babbitt and this wasnt 
the first time dukakis could say he was on a roll 
the wisconsin vote gives a little boost to dukakis said 
joseph crangle erie county ny democratic chairman and one of 
the partys super delegates but youve got to put a qualifying 
clause there that youve got to have a pattern youve got to go 
two or three states in a row in order to say that youre a 
frontrunner 
party chairman paul g kirk jr predicted the democrats would 
choose their nominee on the first ballot of the atlanta convention 
and he vowed to oppose any effort to organize a stopjackson 
movement 
theres not going to be any organized cabal of party leaders 
trying to hobble one candidate as opposed to another said kirk 
a total of 2082 delegates is needed for a convention majority 
to reach that number either dukakis or jackson would need to win 
more than 1300 of the 1600plus committed delegates yet to be 
chosen or draw strong support from the super delegates the party 
and elected officials whose 645 votes could be decisive 
the super delegates are going to stay frozen for a while 
predicted white 
wiener said the super delegates were looking for a candidate 
who can ratle off a big string of wins he said most of those 
delegates accept the view that if there is a clear leader after 
california and new jersey the last two big states to hold 
primaries that super delegates ought to play a leading role in 
propelling that person over the top at three in a row gov 
dukakis has gotten a very good start on that 
an endorsement from new york gov mario cuomo would brighten 
dukakis prospects in the state but there was no sign the governor 
was ready to tilt to his massachusetts colleague 
id like to have it dukakis said he knows that but its 
his decision to make and ill respect whatever decision he makes 
its up to him 
were good friends and colleagues we talk often but hes 
under no legal or moral obligation to endorse anybody 
crangle said he had seen no indication that cuomo was ready to 
endorse

a government minister speaking in a rare news 
conference wednesday rejected us claims that china had provided 
missiles to iran and said beijing has behaved responsibly in 
selling weapons abroad 
foreign minister wu xueqian said his government had taken 
measures to keep missiles from being sold to iran for use in its 
7yearold war with iraq 
before selling intermediaterange conventional missiles to saudi 
arabia china made the saudis promise to forgo transfer or first 
use of them wu said the sale was regarded as unusual because 
china and anticommunist saudi arabia do not have diplomatic 
relations 
our attitude on arms sales is a serious one its a 
responsible one as well wu said heatedly when a reporter asked 
if china was willing to sell weapons to any buyer some press 
tend to pick on china and whenever china sells weapons china 
becomes the newsmaker 
how about the weapons flying around the persian gulf region 
the stinger and exocet he said referring to us and 
frenchmade missiles 
wu defended chinese weapons sales at a wideranging 90minute 
news conference in beijings great hall of the people he was 
accompanied by his deputy qian qichen 
the reagan administration last year suspended its liberalization 
of hightech equipment sales to china to punish beijing for the 
alleged silkworm missile sales to iran however it lifted the 
freeze during a visit by wu last month 
china says it does not sell weapons to iran or iraq 
china has long adopted strict measures to prevent chinese 
missiles from flowing into iran through the international market 
wu said he did not give details of the measures 
us officials say china has shipped silkworms to iran via north 
korea not for ideological reasons but because the trade is 
lucrative 
iran which has used silkworms in attacks on kuwaiti 
installations claims it captured some of the missiles from iraq 
and says it also makes its own 
western observers estimate china sells about 2 billion in 
weapons each year making it one of the worlds top five arms 
exporters 
wu said china is not willing to sell to any buyer in the case 
of the missile sale to saudi arabia he said increasing the arab 
kingdoms defense capability is conducive to the stability of the 
situation in saudi arabia and the middle east 
on another issue wednesday wu said his trip last month to the 
united states had improved uschinese relations they soured last 
year over chinas arms sales and its use of military force to put 
down independence protests in tibet 
the officials also said china seeks to avoid war with vietnam 
over the disputed nansha islands in the south china sea where the 
two countries ships clashed last month 
qian accused vietnam of sending ships to the area to provoke 
china 
he also dismissed recent overtures from president roh taewoo of 
south korea saying china will never establish diplomatic relations 
with that country beijing is a close ally of communist north korea

president reagan will go ahead with 
a summit meeting with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev even if red 
army troops have not started pulling out of afghanistan the white 
house said wednesday 
that might be an even better reason to go to press the case 
for them to depart and depart as soon as possible said 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater so clearly that would 
not be a reason for not going 
the summit is on track and there are a number of issues the 
president will push while he is in the soviet union and if we 
dont have action to pull the troops out of afghanistan by the 
time we go i think that would probably move to the very top of 
the presidents agenda fitzwater said 
reagan is to visit moscow from may 29 to june 2 for his fourth 
summit with gorbachev 
gorbachev said feb 8 that if a withdrawal agreement being 
negotiated in geneva was signed by march 15 soviet soldiers would 
start pulling out may 15 
he also said the withdrawal could be completed within nine 
months with most of the soviet soldiers removed within three 
months 
while the deadline has passed soviet officials have asserted 
the troop pullout will begin this year anyway with or without a 
geneva agreement 
fitzwater said it was difficult to say whether soviet troops 
would be withdrawn by the time reagan visits moscow 
every indication we have is that the soviets are planning on 
pulling their troops out of afghanistan he said the timetable 
is now not precise because of their looking into the negotiations 
but it does appear that that track is continuing

a judge wednesday granted surrogate mother 
mary beth whiteheadgould unsupervised visits once a week with the 
child she bore under a 10000 contract and urged a truce in the 
baby m legal battle 
both sides said they wont appeal the ruling by superior court 
judge birger m sween bringing to a close a court fight that 
sparked worldwide debate on parental rights and reproductive 
technology 
sween held that 2yearold melissa stern originally dubbed baby 
m in court papers will not suffer emotionally by seeing mrs 
whiteheadgould for one sixhour visit a week he said the schedule 
will be expanded over the next year to include overnight stays 
some holidays and two weeks in the summer of 1989 
she and her mother have the right to develop their own special 
relationship sween said in a decision filed in hackensack and 
made public by attorneys here 
the childs father william stern and his wife elizabeth have 
custody of melissa they wanted sween to delay for at least six 
years visits between melissa and mrs whiteheadgould who had been 
seeing the child for two hours once a week under supervision 
sween also moved to protect melissas privacy barring both 
sides from discussing her publicly such as in the promotion of 
books or movies without court approval 
but sweens ruling allows both sides to talk about their 
experiences clearing the way for a book mrs whiteheadgould has 
planned 
mrs whiteheadgould said in a statement released by her 
attorneys that her relationship with melissa will be strengthened 
and advanced by the visitation and she looks forward to a 
meaningful and substantial relationship 
i hope that beginning today there will be a renewed spirit of 
cooperation between all of melissas parents that this cooperation 
will be fueled by our common interest in ensuring her happiness and 
welfare said mrs whiteheadgould 
the sterns were generally unhappy with the ruling but will not 
appeal said one of their attorneys frank donahue 
it wasnt their satisfaction with the decision that made them 
decide against appealing they wanted to put an end to the 
litigation and the publicity and protect melissa donahue said 
sween rejected the sterns contention during last weeks 
visitation hearing that mrs whiteheadgould would emotionally harm 
the child and exploit her in the media 
melissa is a resilient child who is no less capable than 
thousands of children of broken marriages who successfully adjust 
to complex family realtionships when their parents remarry sween 
said 
the judge urged both sides to set aside the bad feelings for 
melissas sake 
family dreams have been shattered insults and false 
accusations have been exchanged and lies and deceptions made in 
the heat of litigation he said however family tragedies in 
our society are not uncommon and parents often are called upon to 
make sacrifices 
the emotional tugofwar began after mrs whiteheadgould then 
married to richard whitehead agreed to be artificially inseminated 
with sterns sperm mrs whitehead who is pregnant has since 
divorced whitehead and married accountant dean gould 
mrs whiteheadgould gave birth to the child march 31 1986 but 
decided to refuse the 10000 surrogate fee and keep the baby that 
decision led to a landmark new jersey supreme court ruling which 
outlawed surrogacyforpay restored mrs whiteheadgoulds 
parental rights upheld custody for the sterns and ordered the 
lower court hearing on visitation rights 
in a related development a florida senate committee wednesday 
approved a bill that would make it a felony to accept a fee to bear 
a child for another couple

a theory that upsets traditional notions 
about 11year sunspot cycles has been bolstered by the earliest 
most detailed observation ever made of solar jet streams that will 
produce sunspots by 1997 scientists say 
astronomer roger ulrich and his colleagues at the university of 
california los angeles were able to see the jet streams at 
higher latitudes on the sun and earlier than we were ever able to 
before said astrophysicist herschel snodgrass of lewis and clark 
college in portland ore 
were seeing the very earliest stage of the next sunspot 
cycle not the one that is producing sunspots now but that one 
that will produce them when this cycle is over said ulrich who 
presented his findings wednesday during a solar physics meeting in 
tucson ariz 
understanding the sunspot cycle is important because the spots 
and related explosions called solar flares disrupt radar radio and 
other communications on earth and in extreme cases are believed 
to contribute to ice ages and major droughts snodgrass said 
tuesday by telephone from portland 
ulrich said solar flares make earths outer atmosphere expand 
so learning more about sunspots is important in deciding when to 
launch satellites since atmospheric expansion produces 
orbitaltering drag on spacecraft 
snodgrass and air force astrophysicist richard altrock said 
ulrichs observation of the jet streams which are eastwest 
currents of gas parallel to the suns equator supports a theory 
they developed independently with california institute of 
technology astronomer peter wilson 
last year they proposed that the 11year sunspot cycle during 
which the number of sunspots reaches a maximum then a minimum and 
then another maximum is merely part of a previously unknown 18to 
22year cycle that produces visible sunspots only during its last 
11 years 
the theory says that during the earliest stages of this longer 
cycle jet streamlike gas currents appear near the suns poles 
like smoke rings which then grow and roll down the sun toward the 
equator altrock said by telephone from sunspot nm 
only when the jet streams reach a solar latitude of 30 or 35 
degrees do they produce sunspots ulrich said 
he said he detected the jet streams at a latitude of 70 degrees 
on the sun 
these jet streams eventually will migrate into the region 
where sunspots form probably about 1997 ulrich said 
the last sunspot cycle reached its minimum in september 1986 so 
the next maximum is expected about 1991 and the next minimum in 
1997 or 1998 snodgrass said 
the current batch of sunspots is rising much faster than any 
other weve seen he added there is evidence to suggest its 
going to be unusually strong and perhaps the maximum will be 
reached earlier than usual in 1989 or 1990 with the minimum 
following in 1995 or 1996 
sunspots are relatively cool spots 1200 to 60000 miles 
across that each appear for three to seven weeks where the solar 
magnetic field is about 1000 times stronger than in other 
locations up to 30 appear at one time 
ulrich and his colleagues were able to see the solar jet streams 
closer to the suns poles in more detail than ever before by 
measuring the speed of gases on the suns surface 20 times daily 
using the 150foottall solar observatory and 75footdeep 
spectrograph on mount wilson in the san gabriel mountains 
northeast of los angeles 
sunlight passes through a lens near the top of the observatory 
tower the lens focuses an image of the sun on a hole that lets the 
light enter the spectrograph 
the spectrograph breaks the sunlight into a rainbow of component 
colors that allows the scientists to measure the speed of solar 
gases and detect jet streams 
its the same way a radar gun on the highway measures the 
velocity of a car ulrich said 
the jet streams may help scientists understand why the number of 
sunspots varies ulrich said

destruction of us mediumrange missiles 
under the new ussoviet nuclear arms reduction treaty will save 
the pentagon about 17 billion through the fall of 1995 the 
general accounting office reported wednesday 
the savings will come because the pentagon will no longer need 
to maintain its pershing and groundlaunched cruise missile force 
in western europe the gao said money will also be saved on 
associated costs for military personnel procurement and 
construction of housing for military family members it said 
army officials told us that some of the equipment procured 
under the pershing ii program would not be subject to treaty 
limitation and would therefore be available for use in other army 
units the ga0 said 
it said this includes radios trucks generators tool kits and 
other support equipment whose total value is unclear 
the air force it said has identified more than 550 million in 
equipment that will be reused and about 50 million in funding that 
will be recovered because of project cancellations 
for example the gao quoted air force officials as saying that 
76 launch control centers valued at about 6 million each for a 
total 456 million will be reused 
and it said about 114 million worth of missile components 
produced under existing air force contracts will be made available 
to the navy for its sealaunched cruise missile program 
the air force also expects to recover about 40 million to 58 
million in previously approved military construction funds 
according to the gao 
the treaty would require the united states to destroy a total of 
867 mediumrange missiles while the soviet union would be required 
to eliminate some 1800 weapons 
the us missiles to be destroyed over a 36month period 
beginning after the pact is ratified by the senate include 178 
pershing ias 247 pershing iis and 442 groundlaunched cruise 
missiles together with their launchers and certain support and 
training equipment 
the costs of actually destroying the weapons are classified and 
will be provided separately to members of congress the agency said 
the pentagon spent a total 65 billion for the pershing ii and 
groundlaunched cruise missile systems the gao said including 
26 billion for the pershings and 345 billion for the cruise 
missiles 
those totals include the costs of research and development 
procurement military construction and missile modifications 
the senate foreign relations committee voted 172 last month to 
recommend the full senate approve the treaty 
barring unexpected developments senate debate on the treaty is 
expected to begin late this month or in early may 
the gao report was requested by sen jesse helms rnc an 
opponent of the treaty

a monthlong ushonduran operation 
culiminating in a predawn police raid in honduras put an alleged 
international cocaine trafficker in illinois federal prison 
wednesday for questioning in the slaying of a us drug agent 
officials said 
a stunned juan ramon matta ballesteros was lodged at the 
maximumsecurity federal prison in marion ill after honduran 
officials on tuesday hustled him onto a plane to the dominican 
republic without a passport us law enforcement sources said 
dominican republic officials put matta on a new yorkbound 
flight and he was arrested aboard the jetliner by us marshals 
the sources said 
angry honduran legislators labeled mattas capture a 
kidnapping and the honduran foreign ministry began an 
investigation of the procedures used the honduran constitution 
prohibits extradition of honduran citizens to the united states 
matta was kidnapped in open violation of our laws carlos 
montoya speaker of honduras singlehouse legislature told 
reporters wednesday it does not only violate our constitutional 
principles and individual guarantees but also all the states 
police laws 
edmond brogan a liberal legislator and editor of the 
influential newspaper el tiempo called the action an abominable 
conduct by president jose azcona hoyos administration and the 
armed forces 
howard safir the chief of operations for the us marshals 
service who is a former drug enforcement administration agent has 
been in and out of honduras for the past month spearheading the 
effort to get matta into us custody said the source speaking 
only on condition of anonymity 
according to us law enforcement sources matta was taken into 
custody in a predawn helicopter raid tuesday by honduran 
authorities at his home in tegucigalpa on a warrant signed by a 
city judge 
mattas wife nancy vasquez said police and the judge had 
placed a bag of cocaine on the table in their house and said they 
had found it there she said there had been no drugs at the 
residence 
carlos lorenzana mattas lawyer said in a telephone interview 
that about 60 heavily armed policemen using helicopters arrived at 
his clients home at 545 am 
matta was stunned by the raid one us law enforcement 
source said he couldnt believe it 
matta had been living openly in honduras after escaping in 1986 
from a colombian prison 
in addition to drug charges the dea wants to question matta 
about the 1985 murder in mexico of dea agent enrique camarena 
salazar according to one us law enforcement source dea agents 
already have interviewed matta briefly since his arrival in the 
united states 
camarena was kidnapped tortured and killed in guadalajara 
mexico in a slaying allegedly ordered by drug traffickers john c 
lawn the head of the dea said matta was one of the four prime 
suspects in the case 
matta had been held in colombia on charges of involvement with 
the medellin cartel the worlds largest cocainetrafficking 
organization 
the marshals service said matta was believed to have become a 
leader of a group of traffickers that controlled the flow of 
illegal drugs from mexico 
us authorities link mattas return to honduras to an increase 
in transshipment of colombian cocaine through the central american 
country 
honduran authorities put matta on a plane headed for the 
dominican republic without a passport the us law enforcement 
sources said 
as a honduran citizen matta could not be extradited to the 
united states because the honduran constitution forbids it 
after being informed matta was wanted in the united states the 
dominican republic put him on a new yorkbound jetliner and matta 
was arrested immediately on board the plane by us marshals 
authorities said 
he subsequently was placed in a cell at marion which the 
federal prison system uses to house its most dangerous criminals 
state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the 
united states viewed the arrest as a major successful step in our 
effort to stem the flow of illegal narcotics trafficking we think 
that both the honduran and dominican republic governments have 
demonstrated their strong commitment to combatting narcotics 
trafficking through their actions 
the marshals service said the expulsion from the dominican 
republic was based on a us warrant for matta after he escaped 
from eglin federal prison camp in florida in 1971 he was serving a 
fiveyear sentence for illegally entering the united states and 
using a fraudulent visa 
warrants charged matta with escape from federal custody 
conspiracy to smuggle cocaine possession with intent to distribute 
cocaine engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise and other 
crimes 
allegations have been made of involvement in drug shipments by 
top honduran military officials 
the government denied the reports in february azcona said 
critics were trying to discredit the armed forces and my 
government which has taken a series of actions to combat the drug 
traffickers 
matta told the associated press in february he makes his living 
in cattle ranching construction and the tobacco spice and coffee 
trade his wealth has been estimated at up to 2 billion but he 
put it at about 5 million 
he said the charges against him were a lie a story and 
claimed us agents tried three times in the past year to kidnap 
him 
matta said then he never again would leave honduras if i 
appear in the united states it is a kidnapping by american agents 
if i am killed it is the dea he said at the time

the black codiscoverer of the north pole 
received what one supporter called long overdue recognition as 
his remains were reinterred with full military honors wednesday at 
arlington national cemetery 
matthew alexander henson was the first to reach the north pole 
and planted the american flag there exactly 79 years earlier during 
a trek with adm robert e peary and four eskimos 
peary was buried at arlington in 1920 and a huge monument to him 
was erected by his grave henson however ended up at his death in 
1955 in a shared grave at woodlawn cemetery in new york because his 
wife could not afford a separate gravesite 
he was denied proper recognition because of the racial 
attitudes of his time said dr s allen counter a harvard 
professor who successfully petitioned president reagan to allow 
hensons reinterment at arlington 
counter who previously had brought together hensons and 
pearys parteskimo offspring told about 100 relatives and 
admirers at the windswept hilltop burial site that the reinterment 
of henson and his wife lucy ross henson was long overdue 
recognition for our hero that would right a tragic wrong 
welcome home matthew henson he said welcome home to a 
new day in america may your presence here inspire generations 
of explorers 
hensons remains now rest alongside pearys with the remains of 
their wives on either side 
descendants of matthew and lucy henson were joined at the 
ceremony by hensons parteskimo descendants fathered when he was 
in the arctic 
now finally matthew henson and robert peary can talk about 
old days out there a grandson qitdlaq henson of qaanaaq 
greenland said through a translator at a news conference following 
the ceremony 
a monument installed next to the gravesite includes a quote from 
henson who was 88 when he died the lure of the arctic is 
tugging at my heart to me the trail is calling the old trail 
the trail that is always new 
although repeated references were made to pearys concern that 
hensons achievements be recognized none of pearys relatives 
attended the ceremony counter said 
im sorry theyre not here counter said at the news 
conference adding that he had invited both pearys son and 
grandson and had offered to help with travel arrangements he said 
that if he had known none of pearys american descendants were 
going to attend he would have invited his parteskimo offspring 
counter said the costs of the reinterments including exhuming 
the hensons from the new york cemetery the two bronze caskets the 
monument bringing hensons offspring from greenland and the rest 
of the arrangements ran into the thousands but he would not be 
more specific or say exactly who paid for what an aide ted doyle 
said counter took care of most of the bills 
gen julius beckton of the white house military office conveyed 
greetings from reagan who approved the reinterment last october 
all americans join us today in saluting matthew alexander 
henson as he receives the recognition he so long deserved 
beckton said 
among those speaking at the ceremony were john h johnson the 
chairman and chief executive officer of johnson publishing co 
which publishes ebony and jet magazines and col guion s bluford 
the first black astronaut 
matthew henson taught us all a great deal johnson said 
he taught us to be independent he taught us to achieve he 
never got the recognition he deserved but he never complained 
bluford described the ceremony as a proud and historic moment

partying vandals made a shambles of 
a suburban house left in the care of the owners 20yearold 
mentally retarded son who fled and apparently was afraid to come 
home 
the young mans mother corinne mcconaghey tells us hes 
capable of functioning in society so everybodys best guess is 
just that hes frightened police sgt doug larsson said 
wednesday 
the mcconagheys returned home monday after a week in florida 
but did not file a missing persons report on their son michael 
until tuesday 
telephone calls to the mcconaghey home were not answered 
wednesday 
i think my michael is still around but hes just deathly 
afraid to come home we want him to come home and were not 
angry mrs mcconaghey said in an interview tuesday with the 
daily herald of arlington heights 
michael who had been left in charge of the house in the past 
invited a few friends over for a party larsson said 
over the next few days word of the openhouse bash spread and 
groups of 10 to 15 partygoers some driving 20 miles from chicago 
dropped by at all hours 
we originally thought this was a marathon kind of party where 
people heard about this on a partyline call or the radio and 
maybe 100 or so people descended on the house for a whole 
weekend said larsson 
but as we piece this together its something that got out of 
hand kids apparently learned about it by wordofmouth and just 
kept showing up in clusters and leaving 
that is a very expensive neighborhood he added somebody 
would have called us earlier if there had been big loud parties 
going all the time 
when police were finally called by a neighbor sunday officers 
found michael home alone and the house in ruins 
police cmdr richard hammer said michael appeared disoriented 
said about 100 people had visited over a twoday period he said he 
passed out at one point and woke up to find the mess 
police say michael apparently fled shortly after they 
interviewed him 
virtually every room in the twostory house was wrecked all the 
upstairs doors were kicked in and there was a large hole in one 
wall police said 
total damage and theft costs including telephones video 
recorders and some computer equipment could exceed 25000 
the familys 1986 buick was stolen but recovered later from a 
nearby forest preserve its radio missing 
at least one person was arrested with items taken from the 
mcconaghey home and larsson said wednesday police expect to make 
additional arrests 
mrs mcconaghey said she hopes the people who wrecked her house 
will understand someday what they did 
i hope this is something they will never forget when they 
are older and in their own houses

the judge in the irancontra case signaled 
wednesday he was ready to discuss a realistic trial date to 
achieve an expeditious disposition of the criminal charges 
against the four defendants 
us district judge gerhard a gesell rejected as too cumbersome 
a proposal by independent counsel lawrence e walsh for elaborate 
procedures to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of 150000 pages 
of classified documents that may become evidence in the case 
walshs proposal appears to be far too complex lacks definite 
time restrictions and creates undue obstacles to the fair and 
expeditous disposition of this case gesell said in a brief 
opinion 
under the prosecution plan defense lawyers for former national 
security adviser john m poindexter lt col oliver north and arms 
dealers richard v secord and albert hakim would be required to 
obtain security clearances before they could examine the documents 
at a special compartmented information facility 
the four defendants are accused of conspiring to defraud the 
government by diverting some of the profits from the usiran arms 
sales to the nicaraguan rebels 
walshs propposal laid out intricate steps under the classified 
information procedures act for court review of sensitive documents 
that might be introduced by either side as evidence when the case 
goes to trial 
walsh said defense lawyers cannot begin examining the documents 
until adequate procedures are imposed by the court he said 
pretrial discovery could take three months 
but gesell said it will be necessary to frame a more limited 
protective order fashioned to the nature of this case which in 
essence alleges a course of conduct carried out using classified 
materials in classified channels from a highly classified site 
the judge said he wants to determine to what extent the 
documents will be made available available immediately for 
inspection by the defense 
at a hearing scheduled for next tuesday the court intends to 
determine the timing of discovery disclosures in relation to a 
realistic trial date gesell said 
gesell said he wants to set an april deadline for interagency 
review of the classified materials that have been collected during 
walshs 15month investigation and set a time for the defense to 
notify the court if it intends to use any secret documents as 
evidence 
under the classified information procedures act the defense is 
required to tell the court which material it will use the statute 
contains procedures for the court to review the documents to 
determine which if any are relevant to the proceedings 
the judge has the power to delete certain secret material and 
substitute statements of facts a particular document would prove 
the socalled graymail statute was enacted by congress in 
1980 to facilitate prosecution of espionage cases and to control 
the disclosure of classified information at trial 
the procedures were envisioned to balance secrecy with the 
governments need to use classified documents as evidence 
representatives of the defense department the cia the national 
security council the fbi and the justice department are reviewing 
the documents assembled by walsh to determine if any can be 
declassified 
in his pleadings walsh said the documents describe in detail 
some of the nations most carefully held secrets about its foreign 
policy its intelligence activities and its covert activities 
the defendants filed a joint opposition to walshs motion for 
expedited consideration of the proposed protective order noting 
that north and poindexter had access to many of the documents when 
they were at the national security council 
the defense motion said walshs proposal raised a number of 
issues about the constitutionality of the classified information 
law as well as the independent counsels power to represent the 
governments national security interests

nine soviet scientists headed for the nevada 
desert on wednesday to conduct tests they hope will prod the reagan 
administration toward a nuclear test ban treaty 
technicians from the institute of physics of the earth under the 
soviet academy of sciences and the natural resources defense 
council an american environmental group are to set off two 
nonnuclear explosions to test the ability of highfrequency 
seismological devices to measure underground nuclear tests 
we expect the experiment to produce new evidence on the 
capability to verify a comprehensive or very lowyield test ban 
treaty said thomas b cochran a physicist with the 
environmental group 
the us and soviet scientists set off three explosions in 
similar tests starting in september 1986 near the soviet nuclear 
test site at semipalatinsk in kazakhstan 
the head of the soviet team nikolai f yukhnin told reporters 
wednesday that the test results from kazakhstan were perceived as 
quite successful in the technical aspects 
considerable political obstacles remain to a nuclear test ban 
treaty however 
the administration refused to join a 19month soviet nuclear 
test moratorium which ended in february 1987 in addition it 
wants the soviets to conduct tests of a system called corrtex to 
supplement seismological monitoring of two nuclear threshold 
treaties signed in the 1970s but never ratified by the senate 
official teams of scientists visited each others test sites in 
nevada and kazakhstan last winter but no date has been set for the 
corrtex tests 
the administration says the tests which use a cable implanted 
in the ground to measure yield would be the first step in a 
process leading to ratification of the threshold treaties and 
perhaps to a pact banning nuclear weapons tests outright 
until the current visit the state department had denied visas 
to soviet scientists wishing to take part in the unofficial natural 
resources defense council experiments said s jacob scherr an 
attorney for the group 
yukhnin said that within the soviet government the foreign 
ministry has given full support to the experiments i think that 
the military people were not fully supportive but they let us set 
up experimental sites around the polygon as the test site in 
kazakhstan is known 
cochran said the nevada tests were designed to measure nuclear 
blasts in the 1 to 10kiloton range well below the 150kiloton 
limit of the threshold treaties 
a kiloton is a force equal to 1000 pounds of tnt the atomic 
device exploded over hiroshima at the close of world war ii had a 
force of 15 kilotons or 15000 pounds of tnt 
unlike earlier seismological equipment cochran said the 
highfrequency devices being used in nevada may have the ability to 
foil attempts to disguise the magnitude of underground nuclear 
blasts such attempts could be made by a process known as 
decoupling or setting off the explosions in underground 
caverns to make them seem smaller 
to measure the nevada tests the soviet team brought over one 
ton of scientific devices which cochran described as some of the 
most sophisticated seismological equipment in the world 
in addition to the team of nine scientists and technicians who 
arrived in washington on tuesday and headed for reno on wednesday 
the head of the soviet academy of sciences yevgeny velikhov was 
to arrive in the united states on april 24 to observe the tests 
one 10ton explosion is scheduled for april 29 at black rock 
desert 90 miles north of reno and another 15ton blast at broken 
hills 100 miles east of reno

the united states has declined to present 
arguments before a world court hearing on the closure of the 
palestine liberation organization mission to the un saying 
international arbitration of the case is not appropriate 
in a letter to the international court of justice in the hague 
us ambassador to the netherlands john s shad noted that the 1987 
antiterrorism law ordering the closure of the plo observer mission 
is being appealed in a us court 
since the matter is still pending in our courts we do not 
believe arbitration would be appropriate shad wrote a copy of 
the letter was made available to the associated press 
the united states respectfully declines the courts invitation 
to submit further views on this issue at a hearing scheduled for 
april 11 he added 
shad noted that attorney general edwin meese iii had concluded 
that the law which was signed last december by president reagan 
calls for the closure of the mission irrespective of any 
international legal obligations that the united states may have 
under the headquarters agreement 
the 1947 agreement regulates the presence of foreign missions to 
the un in new york the plo and the united nations contend that 
the agreement which regulates the presence of foreign missions to 
the un in new york supersedes american law 
the world court has been asked by the un to decide whether the 
united states must submit to arbitration of the dispute over the 
plo mission the usun treaty calls for arbitration of disputes 
but the united states has refused to submit to arbitration in this 
case 
several weeks ago the justice department filed suit in us 
district court in new york after the plo refused to close down its 
office the plo is expected to respond by april 11 and the united 
nations is expected to file a friend of the court brief supporting 
its position 
the plo will not present any arguments before the world court 
either said its lawyer ramsey clark a former us attorney 
general 
the us state department ordered the plo office in washington 
to shut down last year contending the organization was a terrorist 
group congress used a similar argument in ordering the closure of 
the un mission

killing several civilians 
iraq said two iranian jets bombed a packed football stadium in 
the town of kalar in the northeastern sulaymaniyah province 
killing five schoolchildren and wounding 35 others 
we will take revenge and the iranian regime will have to pay 
dearly for its shameful crimes the official iraqi news agency 
quoted a military spokesman as saying

maritime target which usually means a supertanker near irans 
lavan island oil terminal in the central persian gulf during the 
night

iranian prime minister hussein musavi charged that the iraqis 
were stepping up their missile and air strikes to disrupt elections

saying these raids will fail to prevent the elections on the 
contrary it will make our people more determined to cast their 
votes

into iraqs southern port of basra 
it said its antiaircraft missiles batteries shot down a 
sovietbuilt iraqi mig23 jet and a sukhoi su22 fighterbomber 
during two of the bombing raids the mig pilot was killed it said 
but there was no immediate word on the sukhoi pilot 
iraqi communiques said air force jets and helicopter gunships 
flew more than 200 combat missions wednesday and that only one 
plane was lost 
iraqs missile barrage was seen as baghdads response to an 
iranian push into the northeastern mountains of kurdistan

a white prosecutor running unopposed for 
a judgeship that was created as an opportunity for minority 
candidates says he opposes a plan agreed to by legislators to give 
the county a second new judge 
im very disappointed that the people who entered into this 
agreement didnt consult with me or my advisers on it robeson 
county district attorney joe freeman britt said about the plan 
which emerged monday after the death of britts lumbee indian 
opponent left no minority candidates in the contest personally 
i felt it was an unnecessary move 
britt contended the plan to give the county two superior court 
judges does not follow state law and is unfair to taxpayers in 
north carolina smaller counties are lumped into districts that 
share judges 
the general assembly created a judgeship last year specifically 
for robeson county which has a population that is 37 percent 
indian and 26 percent black to give minority candidates a better 
chance to become judge 
but britt 52 automatically became the democratic nominee for 
the judgeship when his opponent julian pierce was slain march 26 
in what police described as a romantic dispute there is no 
republican candidate 
lt gov bob jordan the states ranking democrat met with 
legislators from robeson county and minority leaders monday to 
develop the plan for a second judgeship 
i dont really see how it can be justified britt told the 
fayetteville observer on tuesday its very unusual to have two 
judges from an area the size of robeson county 
apparently a lot of people have been impressed by the claims 
of support by pierce supporters britt said whats happened is 
a very small group of people have run a very good bluff for some 
politicians 
franklin freeman director of the administrative office of the 
courts said the judgeship would cost the state 110000 a year 
since superior court judges in north carolina can be assigned to 
hear cases in any county he said the extra judges time would not 
be wasted 
theres no question we can fully utilize this new judgeship 
this will provide the extra judge power we believe is needed to 
handle the extra case filings across the state

democrats may turn to new york gov 
mario cuomo as their presidential nominee if neither massachusetts 
gov michael dukakis nor jesse jackson starts to win consistently 
and by strong margins in the remaining primaries sen alan 
cranston said wednesday 
the california democrat said he is remaining neutral in the 
primaries and will vote at the national convention for the 
candidate who appears to be best for the party 
cranston told reporters that if either dukakis or jackson 
emerges only a few delegates ahead of the other that wont be 
enough to persuade him or other super delegates to give the 
nomination to the leader 
my definition of someone emerging strongly is someone starting 
to win consistently and by strong margins and winding up with a 
very significant lead in delegates on the eve of the convention 
cranston said 
but if nobodys demonstrated the capacity to win and take 
charge then quite possibly the convention will look to someone 
else for the nomination he said that person might well be 
governor cuomo

palestinians who renounce terror and 
recognize israel are welcome at arabisraeli peace talks but not 
the plo or those who have committed acts of terrorism 
secretary of state george p shultz said wednesday 
shultz spoke in an interview that was televised in israel as he 
met with king hussein of jordan it was taped in jerusalem earlier 
wednesday 
the secretary who called hussein a man of peace hopes to 
persuade the king and prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel to 
drop their reservations and agree to negotations 
say yes to this initiative shultz implored shamir in a 
statement after a final meeting with the prime minister wednesday 
let us redouble our efforts to make it peace a reality 
as he passed the halfway point in his latest middle east 
venture shultz acknowledged having little to show for his second 
visit to the region in a month 
he said he was still committed to making the us peace plan 
work but declared in all candor i am not able to say that it 
is happening while we have made some progress differences have 
not been substantially narrowed 
on departure from ben gurion airport shultz pledged us 
support for israel and its security but said in apparent criticism 
of shamirs reluctance more fundamentally security and progress 
for israel comes from peace between israel and its neighbors it is 
possible it can happen 
his next stop was cairo where president hosni mubarak of egypt 
reaffirmed approval of the us plan and said after talking with 
shultz that he hoped shamir would change his conception for 
the hope of peace 
palestinian representation is among the most difficult unsettled 
issues in 1974 all arab countries including jordan declared the 
plo the sole legitimate representative of the palestinians 
mubarak and president hafez assad of syria have called publicly 
for a plo seat in the negotiations as have ranking jordanian 
officials 
shultzs plan would include palestinians in a joint delegation 
with jordan and us officials have indicated the arrangement is 
satisfactory to hussein 
in 1985 the king appeared to have worked out such an 
arrangement with yasser arafat chairman of the palestine 
liberation organization it fell apart and with it the prospects 
for arabisraeli peace talks 
in the interview with israel television shultz said hussein is 
showing himself ready to be engaged in the latest us effort 
by raising questions about the proposal it calls for talks on 
palestinian self rule then negotiations on an overall settlement 
of the 40year arabisraeli conflict 
he is a partner and is ready to talk and think and work and 
try to find answers shultz said 
he said palestinians who take part in negotiations must be 
legitimate representatives of the people in the israelioccupied 
west bank and gaza strip adding that in no way could israel 
simply choose palestinians it likes 
on the other hand he said the plo is committed to violence and 
israels destruction so palestinians who want to negotiate should 
be willing to step up and say i renounce terrorism i accept 242 
and a basis for negotiation 
his reference was to the un security council resolution that 
implies recognition of israel and calls for it to withdraw from 
occupied territory it was passed after the 1967 middle east war 
in which israel captured the west bank and gaza from jordan and 
egypt 
in an interview tuesday with jordanian editors the secretary 
ruled out a palestinian state said total israeli withdrawal from 
the west bank and gaza was not in the cards and accused the plo 
of trying to exterminate israel 
his comments were not published or broadcast in jordan one 
official said fear of inflaming antiamerican opinion in jordan 
which has a palestinian majority was among the reasons for 
withholding them

president reagan signing a 
proclamation making april 1116 national productivity improvement 
week said wednesday that us business efficiency must be 
increased to meet international competition 
reagan noted that american business productivity growth has been 
declining since the mid1960s and said we must accelerate 
productivity growth in the service and other sectors of the 
economy 
productivity is a measure of the efficiency with which the 
economy produces goods and services 
overall nonfarm productivity in the united states grew by only 
09 percent last year although manufacturing efficiency grew at a 
33 percent rate 
good performance in productivity is especially necessary now 
that we are in world markets for most goods and services and 
because many of our foreign competitors can target the us market 
using stateoftheart technology reagans statement said 
our businesses and their individual leaders must continue 
their efforts to increase productivity by adopting new technologies 
and management innovations and by better strategic planning in the 
increasingly competitive international context it said

the justice department retreated wednesday 
from a stand that would have barred aliens facing deportation from 
having their asylum requests heard before an immigration judge 
earlier rules proposed last aug 28 would have required that all 
claims for asylum and withholding of deportation be heard by asylum 
officers of the immigration and naturalization service 
civil liberties groups say ins is unsympathetic to 
asylumseekers an accusation the agency denies 
under the latest proposed revision immigration judges who 
work for the justice department not ins would continue to 
conduct adversarial proceedings for those asylumseekers facing 
exclusion from the united states or deportation 
the change is an important improvement said arthur helton 
a attorney for the lawyers committee for human rights 
initial asylum applications will be heard by ins asylum 
officers but those officers will receive training from the justice 
department 
helton however objected to provisions in the new set of 
proposals which permit immigration judges to deny full evidentiary 
hearings in certain instances 
helton also said the regulations fail to take into account that 
asylum applicants frequently fail to present asylum claims 
immediately for fear of reprisals against friends and family 
members by the government of their home country the us 
government has the power to reject asylum claims that are made 
following the conclusion of deportation proceedings 
the revised rule published in the federal register will become 
final after a 30day public comment period 
the proposed regulations are in large measure a response to a 
march 1987 supreme court ruling which held that asylum applicants 
need only show a reasonable fear of persecution in order to gain 
asylum rather than the previous threshold of clear probability of 
persecution

a veterans group wednesday agreed to 
admit anyone presenting a ticket to an oyster dinner it has 
held for men only for 39 years but said this is the last year it 
will conduct the event 
men have a right to have a stag party the west virginia 
chapter of the forty amp eight lasociete said in a statement this 
has always been a classy affair sponsored by a classy organization 
we are not pigs and neither are we backward 
the dinner expected to attract 1200 people friday is a 
favorite campaign stop for candidates but republican congressional 
candidate marianne brewster said she had been told she would not be 
admitted because she is a woman even though she bought a ticket 
other candidates subsequently said they would not show up unless 
women were allowed 
attorney general charlie brown also seeking reelection this 
year entered the fray tuesday with a letter to mcdowell county 
school superintendent j kenneth roberts pointing out that the 
dinner site a high school in the county is public property and 
anyone with a ticket must be allowed to attend 
we all would agree west virginia needed progressive changes 
brewster said wednesday this is one giant step in that 
direction 
the forty amp eight chapter said no one will be allowed into the 
event without a ticket no tickets will be sold at the door and it 
will discontinue the dinners its only fundraising event after 
this year 
it is unfortunate that outsiders who could have directed 
attention to the event and what results from it instead chose to 
enhance their own welfare the organization said they should 
have been making statements about the good things that result from 
the event 
money from the 15aticket dinner goes toward sponsorship of 
groups such as the little league and special olympics the 
statement said 
forty amp eight based nationally in indianapolis began as an 
honorary society for american legion members but the groups are 
now separate and legion officials in west virginia dissociated 
themselves from the stag affair 
we split in 1972 we dont even allow forty amp eight lapel pins 
on people in our parades thats how much we split said robert 
vass state adjutant for the legion 
its just a redneck approach he said of the stag dinner 
this is 1988 you dont disenfranchise a congressional candidate 
because shes a woman

the government on wednesday advised 
international relief agencies to remove their foreign workers from 
two droughtstricken northern regions because of increasing rebel 
violence 
the governments relief and rehabilitation commission said the 
tigray and eritrea regions no longer are safe for the foreign 
agencies 
in recent weeks the emergency relief aid distribution by the 
commission and international donor organizations has been 
disrupted by terrorists engaged in destructive activities against 
the unity integrity and freedom of ethiopia the commission said 
in a twopage statement distributed to foreign aid groups 
in addition to the destruction of trucks flying the united 
nations flag and transportation of relief supplies the bandits 
have time and again kidnapped expatriates in the regions it said 
the commission said foreigners should stay out of the north 
until the areas are freed from terrorist activity and tranquility 
is restored to the life of the civilian population in the areas 
the government agency asked donors and international relief 
agencies to turn over their operations to the commission to 
guarantee the continuity of aid to the starving 
in washington state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley said ethiopias food crisis is becoming more severe because 
there is not enough security for aid workers 
were naturally concerned that any diminution of the 
international relief effort will have a negative impact on the 
lives of starving people she said 
clearly in an unpredictable war situation safety for relief 
personnel is also a serious consideration she said we hope 
that the ethiopian government will take steps to ensure the safety 
of relief personnel as well 
last week president mengistu haile mariam told ethiopians in a 
radio address that government troops were facing a grim 
struggle against separatist rebels in eritrea and tigray 
mengistu said the government was mobilizing troops to crush the 
rebellions 
separatist rebels have been fighting for 27 years in eritrea and 
14 years in tigray 
the fighting has disrupted relief efforts in both regions where 
crop failures threaten 35 million people with starvation overall 
nearly 7 million ethiopians are facing famine 
there are about 60 nongovernmental relief organizations working 
in ethiopia but only a few operate in eritrea and tigray agencies 
operating in the area include the international committee of the 
red cross doctors without borders of belgium and catholic relief 
services 
most of the relief agencies in ethiopia arrived during a 198485 
drought and famine that killed an estimated 1 million ethiopians 
it prompted the biggest aid effort in history 
most foreign agencies pared their expatriate staffs after the 
198485 emergency and turned over programs to ethiopians exact 
numbers of foreign workers still in ethiopia were not immediately 
available

the demand made by hijackers of a kuwaiti 
jet is the same as that made by moslems holding americans hostage 
in lebanon freedom for 17 proiranian extremists jailed in kuwait 
for bombing us and french embassies there in 1983 
the arab hijackers forced the airliner to fly to iran on monday 
their nationality and identity remain unknown but speculation 
arose that they might be part of an iranianlinked network of 
terrorists 
kuwait a small oilrich desert emirate caught in the crossfire 
of the iraniraq war refuses to free any of the 17 prisoners and 
reiterated tuesday that kuwait will not bow to blackmail 
the passengers and crew held hostage aboard kuwait airways 
flight 422 have apparently become pawns in a war between followers 
of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and foes of his islamic revolution 
the same could be said about terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press and educator thomas 
sutherland two americans held captive in lebanon since 1985 
kuwait is a conservative state ruled by sunni moslems historic 
rivals of the shiite sect who make up the vast majority of irans 
50 million people 
kuwait fears that irans fundamentalist islamic revolution will 
spread inciting its shiite minority to revolt 
other arab neighbors of iran in the persian gulf have similar 
fears 
spurred by khomeinis revolution and by the 1982 invasion of 
lebanon by israel lebanons shiites launched suicide bombings 
against the israelis and later against us and french troops who 
took part in an illfated multinational peacekeeping force in 
lebanon 
shiite extremists have targeted kuwait in particular over the 
past five years iran accuses kuwait of aiding iraq in the persian 
gulf war 
the 17 prisoners in kuwait were convicted of bombings in 1983 
that killed five people and wounded 86 culminating in attacks on 
the us and french embassies in kuwait 
later terrorist attacks on kuwait included an abortive 1985 
assassination attempt on the emir sheik jaber alahmad alsabah 
three of the 17 prisoners two iraqis and a lebanese identified 
as elias fuad saab were sentenced to death 
the shiite kidnappers in lebanon are concerned in particular 
about saab whose real name is mustafa youssef he is a cousin of 
imad mugniyeh believed by western and lebanese intelligence to be 
the mastermind of islamic jihad or holy war and other extremist 
shiite factions responsible for suicide bombings kidnappings and 
aircraft hijackings in recent years 
western intelligence officials believe saab rigged the bombs 
used in the kuwait attacks 
kuwait has so far not carried out any of the executions but 
that seems to have been its only concession it has arrested dozens 
of other shiites for sabotage since 1983 
mugniyeh 36 is a key figure in the security apparatus of 
hezbollah or party of god an iranianbacked shiite movement 
believed to be the umbrella for factions holding most of the 22 
foreign hostages in lebanon 
his family has been long linked with the hamadis another shiite 
clan involved in kidnappings 
us authorities identified mugniyeh and mohammed ali hamadi 
held in west germany on charges of smuggling explosives as two of 
the four lebanese shiites involved in the june 1985 hijacking of a 
twa airliner in which us navy diver robert dean stethem was 
killed 
the hamadis allegedly kidnapped three west germans in beirut 
trying to force west germany to free mohammed and a brother abbas 
who now is on trial in duesseldorf for kidnapping two germans a 
third hamadi brother abdulhadi hamadi is hezbollahs security 
chief in beirut 
members of the mugniyeh family are thought to have kidnapped 
anderson who was seized march 16 1985 and is the longest held of 
the missing foreigners

president reagan informed congress 
wednesday that he has stripped japan of certain fishing rights 
because of that countrys alleged violation of an international 
whale conservation program 
reagan said the commerce department had certified the violations 
based on permits japan has issued for the killing of southern 
hemisphere minke whales for research purposes 
the sanctions are the strongest possible under legislation 
authorizing presidential action reagan said in a letter to house 
speaker jim wright dtexas 
the administration maintains that japan has run afoul of an 
international whaling commission whale conservation program by 
issuing permits for research that has never been approved by the 
iwc 
the issuance of the permits by japan to its citizens came 
despite a 1987 whaling commission resolution recommending that no 
such licenses be granted until questions about the research program 
were resolved reagans letter said 
it noted that shortly after the certification of the violations 
by commerce secretary c william verity the whaling commission 
adopted a second resolution recommending that japan not go ahead 
with its research program 
japan has continued its whaling activities notwithstanding 
this second resolution the letter said 
under provisions of the magnuson fishery conservation and 
management act and the fishermens protective act reagan directed 
the state department to withhold 100 percent of the fishing 
privileges that would otherwise be available to japan in waters 
under us authority 
the current japanese fishing quota in the 200mile offshore us 
economic zone is zero 
reagan said he was denying japans request to fish for 3000 
metric tons of sea snails and 5000 metric tons of pacific whiting 
in addition japan will be barred from any future allocations 
of fishing privileges for any other species including pacific cod 
until the secretary of commerce determines that the situation has 
been corrected he said 
ken cook spokesman for the us affiliate of the world wildlife 
fund said the announced fishing sanctions would hurt some but 
came too late to save any of the 300 minke whales japan plans to 
take in this years research program 
reagans letter to wright said that the immediate and 
prospective effects of a 100 percent reduction of fishing 
allocations coupled with presidential review in the near future 
is the most effective means of encouraging japan to embrace the iwc 
conservation program 
therefore i will not impose at this time any sanctions 
against japanese fish products imported into the united states it 
said 
reagan ordered verity and secretary of state george shultz to 
report by dec 1 on japans willingness to comply with the whaling 
conservation program 
he also said he was directing verity and shultz to continue 
talks with whaling commission member countries to ensure that we 
bring to a halt all whaling that diminishes the effectiveness of 
the iwcs conservation program 
our actions taken today and in the future should encourage all 
nations to adhere to the conservation programs of the iwc the 
presidents letter said

puddle of blood 
shomron told reporters outside beita some residents tried to 
help the israeli youngsters including several women who hid three 
girls inside their homes

scriptwriters enter the second month of their 
strike against producers with no sign of renewed talks while 
advertisers and striking commercial actors met with a federal 
mediator in new york on wednesday 
the strike by the writers guild of america against the alliance 
of motion picture and television producers which began march 7 
has shortened the season of several television shows caused 
production postponement of spring replacement series and pilot 
shows and could threaten next falls television season 
in the commercial actors strike representatives for the 
combined screen actors guild and american federation of radio and 
television artists met with a federal mediator wednesday in new 
york city in a session that could lead to resumption of talks 
the 100000 members of the two actors unions went on strike 
march 21 against the joint policy committee of the american 
association of advertising agencies and the association of national 
advertisers 
the unions have since signed more than 550 interim contracts 
with companies that want to resume commercial production among 
them are advertising agencies for four of the presidential 
candidates vice president george bush former television 
evangelist pat robertson massachusetts gov michael dukakis and 
sen albert gore of tennessee screen actors guild spokesman mark 
locher said wednesday 
the unions received a letter of written support from jesse 
jacksons campaign which also noted that jackson has not used 
actors in his commercials 
in the writers strike the two sides have not met since a march 
10 federally mediated session and there are no immediate prospects 
of resumed negotiations informal talks two weeks ago between guild 
executive director brian walton and the producers chief 
negotiator nick counter failed to bring results 
meanwhile scores of independent producers and some members of 
the alliance have requested separate negotiations with the guild 
there have been no agreements reached as a result of those talks 
guild spokeswoman cheryl rhoden said 
the majority of those seeking independent contracts with the 
guild are television production companies rhoden confirmed but 
she denied that reaching any agreement with them would create a 
rift between working television writers and stillstriking movie 
writers 
if there were an independent agreement and that is a very big 
if it would have to be responsive to all our members needs 
she said just because someone is doing a television show now 
doesnt mean they might not pick up a movie project next 
a rift between television and movie writers during a 1985 strike 
by the writers guild caused confusion and rancor among the members 
during that strike television writers felt they were being forced 
on strike to support movie writers seeking higher residuals from 
videocassette sales 
rhoden said there were no plans to picket next mondays academy 
awards show although the guild will be monitoring it to make sure 
no violations occur with the guildwritten script for the 
threehour broadcast on abctv 
the script was about 90 percent complete when writers went on 
strike rhoden also said the guild offered no guidelines on whether 
striking members who have received nominations should show up for 
the awards 
we are leaving it up to them she said 
producers representatives have said several times that they are 
standing by their last and final offer made at the start of the 
strike the sherman oaksbased alliance has said its proposal would 
raise writers pay by 50 million over three years despite calling 
for a reduction in residual payments for some onehour tv shows 
writers have claimed their own analysis of the offer shows it 
would result in a loss of more than 378 million for its 9000 
members

police fired tear gas and birdshot to 
break up an opposition demonstration in panama city wednesday as 
the united states completed deployment of 1300 extra troops to 
panama 
hundreds of onlookers shouted insults at police who dispersed 
about 50 people marching to protest the economic crisis and the 
strongman rule of gen manuel antonio noriega residents and 
shopkeepers hurled garbage into the streets and set fire to piles 
of refuse 
a stateowned television station reported that two us soldiers 
in an army jeep were stopped and detained by panamanian troops near 
the demonstration major ann crum of the us southern command said 
the soldiers were released an hour later 
in other developments wednesday 
panamas civilian chief executive manuel solis palma 
announced the government had agreed to talks with opposition groups 
without preconditions or irreconcilable demands 
the reagan administration said that 800 marines would start 
arriving in panama on friday for what it described as routine 
jungle training they will be there for three weeks and then they 
will come out said marlin fitzwater the presidents chief 
spokesman he said the move was not related to the dispatch of 
troops to protect the us southern command 
panamas opposition which has been seeking noriegas ouster for 
more than 10 months sponsored a march against hunger wednesday 
afternoon but police flooded the park where it was to take place 
nonetheless about 50 protesters met at a nearby church and 
began a march to the central business district 
they had gone nearly a mile when police stopped them with a 
barrage of tear gas and birdshot 
hundreds of people jeered at the police from sidewalks and 
balconies despite the swirls of tear gas that enveloped blocks of 
central avenue the main shopping thoroughfare 
many onlookers threw garbage into the avenue and sidestreets and 
set fire to piles of refuse it took more than an hour for police 
to restore order 
a spokesman for the us southern command who spoke on 
condition he was not identified said two american soldiers 
apparently got lost and drove into the area by accident he said 
the army was investigating the case 
the march was designed to protest a deteriorating economic 
situation that has left thousands of panamanians penniless 
panamanians began a run on the banks in late february after 
noriega supporters removed president eric arturo delvalle from 
office and banks closed on march 4 the countrys economic crisis 
has been exacerbated by the freezing of panamanian deposits in us 
banks and sanctions imposed by washington 
police halted one demonstration tuesday with a heavy show of 
force and restricted another at the panama canal administration 
building 
the new us soldiers arriving at howard air force base just 
outside panama city included members of an army aviation battalion 
from fort ord calif and military police and security specialists 
from fort bragg nc and fort mead md 
they were ferried to panama by a fleet of c141 starlifter and 
c5 galaxy jet cargo planes the aviators brought 26 helicopters 
including seven powerful ah1 cobra gunships 
chief warrant officer tommy j mccoin of redmond ore a cobra 
pilot said the mission was a training exercise not a buildup for 
military action against panama 
weve got too big a heart to be invading he said 
the new soldiers joined more than 10500 american military 
personnel already based in the latin american country to protect 
the panama canal until it is turned over to the panamanian 
government by treaty at the turn of the century 
in ordering the buildup last week the pentagon said the new 
troops were needed to provide security for us citizens and 
installations because of noriegas heavyhanded tactics 
panama has called the deployment a prelude to invasion 
solis palma said he had been delegated by noriega chief of the 
15000strong defense forces to represent the general in any talks 
mediated by panamas roman catholic archbishop monsignor marcos 
gregorio mcgrath 
it was not known if the opposition would accept solis palma as 
the generals representative since they still recognize delvalle 
there was no comment from the government on whether it would 
meet the opposition groups conditions for talks which include a 
demand that noriega set an early date for his resignation 
mcgrath was asked to mediate the crisis last week by president 
oscar arias of costa rica spains prime minister felipe 
gonazalez and expresidents carlos andres perez of venezuela and 
daniel oduber of costa rica 
delvalle was dismissed by the noriegacontrolled national 
assembly in retaliation for his attempt to force the generals 
resignation 
the dismissal triggered an economic crisis that has left the 
government unable to pay its debts or the salaries of its 15000 
soldiers and 130000 civilian employees

the arizona senate convening as an 
impeachment court for the last time voted wednesday to pay deposed 
gov evan mechams legal fees for the trial which removed him from 
office 
the time has come to take the first step extend the hand for 
a handshake and say this is over mechams attorney jerris 
leonard said in requesting payment of 20243375 lets start 
the healing process 
leonard told the senate that he attorney fred craft and their 
assistants were assured of being paid in any case 
the senate approved the payment on a vote of 1613 
several senators urged the payment as a sign of compassion 
though some other senators were annoyed that mecham had been on 
national television a few hours earlier proclaiming his innocence 
in an interview on abcs good morning america mecham said 
he might appeal his conviction to the us supreme court 
leonard said after the senate session that he would have to 
study the legal issues before he could decide on attempting an 
appeal 
arizona supreme court chief justice frank x gordon told a news 
conference later in the day that the senate was mechams court of 
last resort and he cant appeal 
also on wednesday two phoenix residents sued seeking to cancel 
the may 17 gubernatorial recall election as unnecessary 
rose mofford the former secretary of state was sworn in as 
mechams successor tuesday on wednesday a maricopa county 
superior court judge rejected a bid to have her name barred from 
the ballot in the event a recall election goes forward 
mecham had said in his tv interview that he plans to run in the 
may 17 recall election if the courts rule that his name can be on 
the ballot arizonas acting secretary of state has ordered 
mechams name removed pending a resolution of legal issues 
ive never had more support mecham said adding that he 
believed he could win the recall election ill definitely run in 
it unless they get it so tied up in legal technicalities he said 
one senator democrat jesus chuy higuera cited mechams 
interview as grounds for not paying of his legal fees 
if mecham were elected again hed probably be impeached again 
and the senate would be stuck with a precedent for paying his fees 
higuera said 
republican john mawhinney who voted against paying the fees 
said the impeachment was mechams fault and we are not allowed to 
buy compassion 
mecham 63 was convicted monday on charges that he tried to 
thwart a deaththreat investigation and misused 80000 from a

months ago in reporting on justice minister frits korthals altes 
announcement the tv account gave no details on what happened to 
heyn 
it said six suspects were arrested in a predawn raid wednesday 
in landsmeer 10 miles north of amsterdam but one was released 
later in the day the report did not identify any of the group in 
line with dutch police practice 
the television report said the five were thought to hold part of 
a ransom of more than 43 million in cash and diamonds paid for 
heyn on nov 27 
among those held was a 45year old architect whose house police 
staked out for weeks the tv report said it was there the six were 
arrested it said 
police were not immediately available to comment on the 
televison report 
heyn vice chairman of the ahold grocery concern was kidnapped

a month later the kidnappers mailed one of heyns fingers to 
ahold as proof they were holding him they never gave further proof 
heyn was still alive 
a 70member police team was organized to solve the kidnapping

lifted in december when authorities launched a national publicity 
blitz and promised a millionguilder 550000 reward for 
information leading to the kidnappers arrest

state authorities announced wednesday 
they will make public most of files of the los angeles police 
departments investigation of the 1968 assassination of robert f 
kennedy including the departments final uncensored investigative 
report 
the huge file to be made public april 19 have been stored in 
the state archives since last august and include some 2500 
photographs 50000 square feet of written material and interviews 
with 4000 witnesses 
most of the material has been sealed since 1969 although a 
partial summary of the files was released in 1986 
secretary of state march fong eu whose office has custody of 
the files said officials will release all materials except those 
prohibited by specific laws and those which fall within another law 
enforcement agencys jurisdiction the withheld material includes 
autopsy photos juvenile records and fingerprint cards 
most of the documents to be released have never before been made 
public eu said she added that much of the manuscript material is 
fragile and faded and of an irreplaceable nature 
kennedy was shot june 5 1968 in the ambassador hotel moments 
after claiming victory in the california democratic presidential 
primary he died the following day 
sirhan bishara sirhan a native of jordan was convicted of the 
killing and sentenced to die in the san quentin gas chamber but 
his death sentence was changed to life imprisonment in 1972 when 
the california supreme court outlawed the death penalty 
he is currently imprisoned at soledad where he has since been 
denied parole numerous times since he first became eligible to 
apply for parole in 1975 
the lapd investigation into the robert f kennedy 
assassination by sirhan sirhan was exhaustive yet public concern 
about its conclusions remains 20 years later eu said in a 
written statement released by her office in light of that 
concern we believe the publics right know generally outweighs 
privacy concerns and have governed our public release of these 
materials with that guideline 
the files include reports of investigations of specific 
conspiracy theories sirhan has since said he acted alone in 
killing kennedy and audio and video tapes from the crime scene 
the material has been stored in sacramento since last august 
under an agreement between los angeles and the state the agreement 
followed a lengthy effort by scholars and other interested persons 
to persuade los angeles police officials not to keep the material 
secret

president corazon aquino on wednesday 
shrugged off new threats of violence by the escaped leader of a 
1987 coup attempt but other officials said the military had 
readied itself for possible attacks 
a statement attributed to former lt col gregorio gringo 
honasan vowed he would act boldly after having fled a prison 
ship in manila bay saturday it said honasan promised last november 
not to engage in hostile acts against the aquino government so 
she could make good her promises of political reform but the 
statement said it later became obvious that her administration 
imperiled the nation and so we are now withdrawing that 
declaration 
mrs aquino said i think he will have to admit that the 
government had adequately answered already the legitimate 
grievances and i think the filipino people definitely will go 
against honasan he will not be able to get support 
honasan had been detained since dec 9 for last years aug 28 
coup attempt that left 53 people dead and hundreds wounded 
national security adviser emanuel soriano dismissed honasans 
statement as just hot air but added of course we will be in 
a situation of watchful waiting 
sen ernesto maceda chairman of the senate defense committee 
said that while honasan would lie low for a while he would 
eventually move in the direction of taking some action to 
destabilize the government 
maceda added however the armed forces of the philippines 
leadership has already put into action instructions and strategies 
to neutralize any effort on the part of honasan to contact regroup 
or reconsolidate his friends or forces within the military 
the 160000member armed forces was put on alert and a 
nationwide search was mounted for honasan after he escaped with 14 
of his guards but military spokesman col oscar florendo said 
troops found no trace of him 
defense secretary fidel ramos described the honasan statement as 
a call to violence and said he ordered the military to verify 
its authenticity 
the statement was distributed to news agencies wednesday 
honasan had accused the government of being soft on communist 
rebels when he attempted his coup 
communist new peoples army rebels meanwhile kidnapped town 
mayor manuel pandayos and two other officials on monday in quirino 
in northern ilocos sur province the military said 
on southern mindanao island 20 raiders thought to be moslem

sen paul simon is expected to suspend his 
campaign for the democratic nomination for president on thursday 
but will remain an official if inactive candidate his mother 
confirmed wednesday night 
he is not dropping out said ruth simon 83 of 
collinsville ill too many people have advised him to stay in 
and thats what he is going to do 
simon himself has been mum about his plans 
the illinois senator said before tuesdays wisconsin primary 
that he would have to reassess his campaign if he did not do well 
he placed a distant fourth behind massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis jesse jackson and tennessee sen albert gore 
he is just suspending his campaign in part because of the 
high cost of media advertising mrs simon told radio station wryt 
in edwardsville 
but she said hes going to hang in there till the end 
mrs simon who said her son called her tuesday night said he 
planned a weeks vacation with his family 
in washington on wednesday congressional sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity said simons campaign suspension meant he 
would not seek to participate in campaign debates scheduled in new 
york before that states april 19 primary 
michael kreloff the simon campaigns illinois legal counsel 
said wednesday night that he could not confirm what simon would say 
in a washington news conference scheduled for thursday 
simons remaining in the race even as an inactive candidate 
would allow him to garner more delegates before the democratic 
national convention in july in atlanta and hang on to those he has 
under party rules and because of their showings in the march 15 
illinois primary simon is entitled to 47 atlarge delegates from 
illinois while jackson is entitled to 13 and dukakis none 
a simon withdrawal would automatically shift his 47 delegates to 
jackson who is now behind in the delegate count those 47 would be 
enough to put him ahead 
kreloff said that if simon suspends active campaigning instead 
of dropping out of the race it would be understandable 
if in fact thats what he does it would seem to be a 
sensible position given that there is no clear favorite kreloff 
said i think its the fairest thing to do for illinois voters 
who voted march 15 so the delegates reflect what the voters 
wanted 
while an inactive simon campaign could block jackson from 
garnering the 47 atlarge delegates simon will get one simon 
backer said wednesday she does not think the senator is engaging in 
a stopjackson movement 
thats just not paul simon said luellen laurenti of normal 
an elected simon delegate and a member of the democratic state 
central committee 
i still think that paul wants to be in a position to have 
a little leverage in the outcome of this thing and the outcome of 
the platform ms laurenti said i think he does have a vision 
and he does have an internal passion he just has trouble showing 
it on the outside 
there are just too many important things that need to be 
decided for simon to say im throwing in the towel now he has 
a right to have some say she said

president daniel ortega warned the 
contra rebels wednesday that if ceasefire talks break down the 
government will begin a major military offensive 
if the contras dont accept the agreements the people must be 
ready for combat and launch an offensive with all available 
force to be rid of the contras once and for all and not prolong 
the war he said in remarks carried on the state radio voice of 
nicaragua 
earlier in the day the radio reported that contra and 
sandinista military representatives agreed on seven zones where 
rebels will gather during their 60day ceasefire 
the two sides remained far apart however on key issues to 
bring about a permanent peace 
the sandinistas launched an offensive against the contras in 
northern nicaragua last month on president reagans orders 3200 
us troops flew to honduras on march 1718 after honduran 
president jose azcona hoyo said 2000 nicaraguan soldiers had 
invaded his country in pursuit of contras 
the us troops never saw action and returned home at the end of 
march 
wednesdays meeting in the southern border town of sapoa the 
fourth set of talks in less than a month dealt with the mechanics 
of pursuing the truce which went into effect friday 
the voice of nicaragua broadcasting from sapoa said boundaries 
were set for two zones in the north two in central nicaragua two 
on the remote caribbean coast and one in the south 
just about all the details were defined about the location and 
dimension of the zones but tomorrow the method of operation will 
be discussed maj gen joaquin cuadra lacayo chief of the 
sandinista delegation said in a broadcast interview after 
discussions recessed for the day 
cuadra is chief of staff of the sandinista army 
the contras are to gather in the zones during the first 15 days 
of april it still must be decided how to provide security 
assurances for the rebels and how humanitarian assistance can be 
delivered to them 
on march 23 the two sides formally agreed to the truce as part 
of a plan to end a war that killed or wounded an estimated 50000 
people over nearly seven years 
neither the leftist sandinista government nor the nicaraguan 
resistance the ussupported contra rebel organization says it 
is satisfied with the other sides compliance with the accord 
contra leaders accused the sandinistas of violating a section of 
the pact that calls for unrestricted freedom of expression by 
failing to supply newsprint to nicaraguas only opposition 
newspaper la prensa 
at a news conference wednesday la prensa publisher violeta 
barrios de chamorro called the newsprint restriction a deliberate 
blow to freedom of expression in nicaragua 
the accord also called for the release of 100 political 
prisoners on march 27 the contras complain the sandinistas freed 
only 10 of the prisoners the rebels had on their list although the 
pact does not specify the rebels have a say in who goes free 
issues still pending include how and when the contras will lay 
down their weapons this is not spelled out in the plan nor does 
the plan say what will happen to the contras after they gather in 
the zones 
under the plan the government pledges that the individuals 
who have been reintegrated into normal civilian life will be able 
to take part in future elections 
but normal civilian life is open to interpretation in 
nicaragua where the government claims to have 300000 people under 
arms 
the contras backed out of a highlevel meeting to continue 
definitive ceasefire negotiations originally set for wednesday 
in managua the capital they said the meeting must wait until 
security issues for the rebels were resolved 
the two sides are arguing about an agenda for the next meeting 
as well as a date 
in addition the contras insist that their 55member delegation 
stay at managuas downtown intercontinental hotel and be free to 
meet with political opposition leaders 
maria teresa zambrana head of reservations at the hotel said 
wednesday the contras have reserved 50 rooms for april 1215 
the sandinistas have said that for security reasons the contra 
delegation would be housed at a hotel near the airport

the state department hired at least one 
company linked to earlier drug smuggling to transport aid to the 
usbacked contra rebels in nicaragua and was put in touch with 
the company by the cia according to congressional testimony and 
sources 
the departments nicaraguan humanitarian assistance office in 
early 1986 signed a series of contracts totaling more than 300000 
with vortex a small miami air transport and service company to 
airlift humanitarian aid to the rebels michael b palmer an 
admitted former drug pilot who then worked for vortex said 
wednesday 
the company was unprepared to handle the volume of supplies the 
state department wanted transported and had to rent a larger 
warehouse to accommodate the job palmer told the senate foreign 
relations narcotics subcommittee 
vortex also did airplane maintenance work for cia proprietary 
companies resupplying the contras in 1987 and in late 1986 sold 
the cia supply operation a dc6 that formerly had been used to haul 
drugs according to his testimony and committee staff members 
investigators for the congressional irancontra committees have 
told the narcotics panel that the state department selected vortex 
from a list of transport companies provided by the cia according 
to a senate committee source speaking on condition of anonymity 
if the contra delivery system is using known narcotics dealers 
for airlifts its no wonder you have confusion surrounding the 
policy said subcommittee chairman sen john kerry dmass 
it was unclear whether the department knew that it was hiring a 
company with drug links to undertake part of the resupply 
operation robert duemling who ran the nhao was expected to 
testify before the panel on thursday 
kerry said the arrangement illustrated the absurdity not to 
mention the impropriety of a government contract going to someone 
with drug involvement handing out us taxpayer dollars to 
support their business 
somethings wrong here kerry said a contractor to nhao 
flying in an exdrug plane working simultaneously in narcotics 
undercover and supplying goods to the contras 
but palmer said that was part of the reality of drug enforcement 
efforts he said agencies dont have the money to own their own 
aircraft for undercover operations or the desire to undertake such 
risky ventures themselves 
enter sf a 27 million state department 
effort to deliver nonlethal supplies to the contras authorized by 
congress in 1985 the general accounting office later sharply 
criticized the operation saying large amounts of the aid could not 
be accounted for 
wednesdays hearing was part of a continuing series of sessions 
kerry said are intended to alert the public and policymakers to the 
pervasiveness of drug trading throughout latin america later 
witnesses kerry said will establish even stronger links between 
drug trafficking and resupply efforts for the contras 
palmer was arrested on marijuana smuggling charges in michigan 
in 1986 along with others while working for the state department 
and acting at the same time as an informant for the drug 
enforcement administration and the customs service others charged 
at that time were convicted but palmers indictment was dropped 
because of his role in helping the government he testified 
palmer said the decision to drop charges against him was made 
locally in detroit and was due to circumstances surrounding an 
undercover operation and did not involve washington higherups or 
the contra connection 
but kerry said there had been a washington meeting about 
disposition of palmers case and that the question of who prompted 
his release remained open

wasting its time and asked the iranians to mediate between the 
hijackers and kuwaitis reported irans islamic republic news 
agency or irna 
in their statement the hijackers also warned iranian security 
forces not to take any action against the plane and the hijackers 
irna reported 
the agency quoted the hijackers as saying in a statement that 
they wanted the world to realize the real nature of the kuwaiti 
rulers who have overlooked all the problems of the muslim world at 
the top of them the issue of palestine and the brave palestinians 
who are fighting israel 
the hijackers said they would free any hostage they thought had 
nothing to do with the issues involved irna reported but keep the 
others and treat them in such a way as to settle our account 
with kuwait

and hand grenades

refusing to yield declaring kuwait has taken an exemplary 
position in the struggle against international terrorism and we 
applaud them for it 
twelve britons were on the plane before the release early

kuwait to negotiate and told reporters we do not give in to 
blackmail because it only leads to further tragedies 
in tehran senior military spokesman kamal kharrazi told a news 
conference attended by an associated press reporter the 
hijackers identity is still not known to us we only know that 
they speak arabic and want the prisoners in kuwait to be freed

masked man brandishing a pistol announced the hijack in english as

shiite fundamentalist groups loyal to iranian ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini that are believed to hold most of the 22 western hostages 
in lebanon 
many acts of terrorism in kuwait have been blamed on shiite 
moslems acting for iran which has been at war with iraq since 
september 1980 and accuses the sheikdom of being its enemys ally 
no precise list of the nationalities of the remaining hostages 
was available because of differences in lists released by irna and

dont jump to easy conclusions about those 
falling jobless rates the picture isnt nearly as clear as it has 
been made to appear 
a rush of analyses and a spate of media stories followed the 
announcement last week that the civilian unemployment rate had 
fallen to 56 percent of the labor force the lowest since may 1979 
speculation developed that the economy was overheating that the 
federal reserve would be forced into a tougher monetary policy and 
even that a shortage of workers might endanger some companies 
the news isnt that sharply defined however seldom has the job 
situation been more complicated showing signs of both economic 
strength and weakness at the same time 
evidence of a very strong economy is suggested by this example 
more than 5 million jobs have been created in the past two 
years and expectations for further improvement are showing up in 
surveys such as that conducted quarterly by the national 
association of independent business 
this improvement in the numbers has come in spite of hiring 
holddowns by some large corporations and a serious effort by 
major companies to eliminate entire layers of whitecollar 
bureaucracy 
but there is another side to the story not all the improvement 
in the jobless rate can be attributed to economic strength much of 
what appears to be strength is simply the result of a reduced rate 
of labor force expansion 
the dramatic surge of women into the labor market that took 
place in the 1960s and 1970s has abated in addition the birth 
rate decline in those same decades results in fewer young people 
entering the labor force now 
the slowing of labor force growth therefore makes the falling 
jobless numbers look better than they are 
but there are other inconsistencies and oddities too and they 
create uncertainty about almost any interpretation of jobless 
statistics 
operators of retail outlets in some areas of the country are 
begging for parttime workers but the outlook for this years 
college graduates isnt as good as it was a couple of years ago 
employers are said to be more selective 
though service industries are big hirers adding 85000 jobs in 
march alone in the same month no overall job growth took place in 
the nations factories in fact small declines occurred in 11 
industries 
and in spite of the low and delcining jobless figures the 
number of discouraged workers actually rose in the first quarter 
the bureau of labor statistics now includes one million in that 
status higher than last year 
adding to the difficulty of analyzing employment numbers is 
still another problem a big difference in the two surveys one a 
measure of payrolls the other a survey of households used by the 
bureau of labor statistics 
the business survey found a seasonally adjusted rise of 260000 
in payroll employment from february to march the household survey 
showed a seasonally adjusted decline both in the labor force and 
employment 
what does it mean the consensus seems to be that the job market 
is strong so strong it could contribute to inflation a strong 
market tends to push up wages it means the hiring of less 
productive workers also inflationary 
one of the immediate consequences of that interpretation is talk 
around wall street that the federal reserve will raise interest 
rates and that in turn stock prices could be forced lower 
perhaps wiser heads are biding their time however knowing that 
numbers such as these dont reveal their secrets quickly but only 
over a more extended time

internal revenue service form 4868 is surely a 
popular piece of paper right now 
for those who have not yet had occasion to use it 4868 is the 
document taxpayers must file by april 15 to get an automatic 
extension of the deadline on their federal tax returns 
such extensions are in heavy demand this year with taxpayers 
and paid preparers struggling to adjust to the new system that went 
into effect in 1987 mandated by tax reform 
confusion has been running high about many provisions of the new 
code even among professional veterans of the tax wars 
suppose for example that you have passive losses from some 
partnership activity the irs recently released 265 pages of 
temporary passive loss regulations and this is only the 
beginning observed the jk lasser tax institute in its current 
monthly bulletin 
if you are overwhelmed by tax questions preoccupied by other 
pressing matters or simply in a mood to procrastinate you can put 
off the deadline for completing your return until aug 15 by simply 
filing form 4868 now 
for this extension unlike any subsequent one you might seek 
the government doesnt require any explanation or excuse but if 
uncle sam has any money coming from you he wants it now not later 
the rules require that you include with form 4868 a check for 
the estimated balance of what you still owe beyond what was 
withheld from your wages or salary and any other payments you have 
already made 
the estimate should be made with some care if it turns out that 
you still owe money for 1987 when you file your return on say 
june 30 the government will charge you interest at a 10 percent 
annual rate on the balance due 
and if what you still owe amounts to more than 10 percent of 
your total tax bill for the year a penalty may also be imposed 
although it is a helpful option to have an extension is not 
always an unmixed blessing 
for one thing if you have a refund coming you cant claim it 
with form 4868 that has to wait until your return is filed and in 
the interim the government has what amounts to the free use of the 
money 
that cost may be a small one to pay however if an extension 
allows you or your professional preparer the breathing space 
necessary to make a careful computation of every tax break to which 
you are entitled 
extensions are also automatically granted without a form 4868 
for two months if you can document that you were out of the united 
states or puerto rico on april 15 but a quick dash across the 
border and back will no longer do the trick 
nettled by an airlines advertisements touting foreign travel as 
a tax dodge the irs recently said these extensions apply only to 
people who can show that they were out of the country for at least 
14 consecutive days including all of april 15 
does an extension in any form increase or reduce your chances 
of getting audited probably not says the arthur young tax guide 
some tax experts contend that you should request the maximum 
extension allowed for filing your return arguing that the chances 
of an audit are reduced since irs field agents will have less time 
to conduct the audit the accounting firm says 
other tax experts contend youre better off filing on april 15 
since this way you get lost in the crowd both theories are 
oversimplifications of irs procedures

encouraged by studies showing housing 
affordability has improved a result of rising incomes and lower 
interest rates many young couples are seeking to buy their first 
houses this spring 
now is as good a time as ever to buy a home says nestor r 
weigand jr president of the national association of realtors 
because conditions over the last few months are the best of the 
decade 
he points to an affordability reading of 113 meaning a family 
earning the median income of 31384 had 113 percent of the income 
needed to qualify for a conventional 80 percent loan on an existing 
medianprice home of 88300 
thats one point of view and it is wellsupported by the 
evidence however it applies only to those who manage to come up 
with the 20 percent down payment which in some parts of the 
country can mean a lot of cash 
theres another viewpoint no matter what the affordability 
measures say it is still going to be difficult for most firsttime 
buyers those who seek to put down only 10 percent or 15 percent 
to get the house of their choice 
those who say that have been observing a growing phenomenon a 
tendency for mortgage lenders to seek higher downpayments from 
their customers thus obliterating the good news coming from 
housing and real estate people 
because of the surge in housing prices over the past 
halfdecade two big obstacles face firsttime buyers first they 
must have sufficient money for the down payment secondly they 
must be able to afford carrying costs 
while two incomes help solve the second of these challenges 
these incomes might have very little impact on the problem that of 
amassing the down payment young people have a tough time saving 
for reasons well known to everybody 
recognizing this the market responded with extremely low down 
payments made possible in part by mortgage insurance that reduced 
the lenders risk as a result many buyers were able to get by 
with 10 percent down or even less 
as it turns out however what was good for the homebuyer was 
not always so for the private mortgage insurance industry real 
estate prices have actually fallen in some areas eroding the 
owners tiny equity 
in some instances owners of houses with insured mortgages have 
found when they sold that they had insufficient money to pay off 
the mortgage that being so some mortgage companies have 
experienced a surge of claims 
the response of such insurers is to seek customers who make 
larger initial payments and with prices in many communities 
double or triple the national median that can mean a sum beyond 
the abilities of most young couples 
the insistence by lenders that buyers obtain mortgage insurance 
and the insistance by mortgage insurers that the buyer make a 
larger down payment tends to offset the impact of lower interest 
rates and a variety of mortgages 
it leaves the firsttime homebuyer in a tough spot which is 
nothing new as the statistics show 
in 1986 according to the realtors the home ownership rate fell 
to 638 percent from 656 percent in 1980 for those in the prime 
homebuying ages of 25 to 43 years the descent was sharper to 454 
percent from 55 percent 
sympathy for young couples isnt universal however 
raymond roehrick 75 of hixson tenn offers a comment typical 
for many members of his generation 
when we got married in 1937 no young married could buy a home 
only those over 50 owned them as now the young marrieds had to 
save for 15 years just for a down payment 
all over the country homes by the federal housing 
administration and others for 15000 up are going begging for 
owners because young people dont have the guts to start at the 
bottom buy a shack fix it up and sell it

a mainline american denomination the american 
baptist churches is backing away from its support of abortion 
rights officials indicated this week 
it was the first such definitive shift projected among the 
larger socially activist protestant bodies 
similar reassessments have come in some other major 
denominations either stiffening opposition to abortion or 
qualifying acceptance of it but some still take an essentially 
prochoice position 
the turn away from it planned by american baptists stemmed both 
from simmering discontent with the past stance and the swelling 
tide of abortions in the country 
the great proliferation of abortion has made us stop and look 
at whats happening here says gloria marshall of alto loma 
calif head of a task force which has been reexamining the issue 
for more than two years 
its a process of reevaluation and reassessment she said in 
a telephone interview this is a continuing necessity if the 
church is to carry out its prophetic role on such a key social 
issue 
she said positions cant be fixed in concrete but are 
pulled along by social changes on the issue and as we understand 
more about it she termed the projected new stand 
responsibility to choose life 
it attempts a pathbreaking middle ground 
it is a prolife stance in affirming the sacredness of life as 
a gift of god she said but it avoids both the prolife and 
prochoice terms commonly used in the polarized conflict over 
abortion 
mrs marshall a former missionary in zaire and wife of a 
minister said weve sought a different vocabulary for dealing 
with a very complex subject weve tried to find a common ground 
for ministering to people about it 
the newly prepared statement expected to be approved in a final 
presentation to a policymaking general board in june acknowledges 
keen diversity among the denominations 16 million members on the 
issue 
howevever the statement breaks with the previous 1981 stand 
which saw abortion in terms of religious liberty as a matter of 
responsible personal choice 
the new document recognizing life as a sacred and gracious 
gift of god says 
as american baptists we oppose abortion as a means of 
avoiding responsibility for conception as a primary means of birth 
control without regard for the farreaching consequences of the 
act 
we denounce irresponsible sexual behavior and acts of sexual 
violence that contribute to the large number of abortions each year 
we grieve with all who struggle with the difficult 
circumstances that lead them to consider abortion recognizing that 
each person is ultimately responsible to god we encourage women 
and men in these circumstances to seek spiritual counsel as they 
prayerfully and conscientiously consider their decision 
a sister church the larger 146million southern baptist 
convention takes a firmly antiabortion position toughening that 
stand in 1984 to ask for laws prohibiting all abortion except to 
save the physical life of the mother 
changes also have come among more liberal mainline bodies 
including 
the presbyterian church usa in 1985 qualified its acceptance 
of choice in the matter opposing abortion as a method of birth 
control or for convenience or to ease embarrassment 
the church of the brethren in 1984 explicitly condemned 
abortion after previously taking a more pastoral view of it 
the former lutheran church in america now merged into the 
evangelical lutheran church in america in 1980 sharpened its 
rejection of abortion saying it destroys life and urged laws 
protecting it from conception to birth 
numerous denominations have steadily rejected abortion 
including eastern orthodox churches roman catholicism the 
lutheran churchmissouri synod mormons and conservative 
evangelical denominations 
however several mainline bodies such as the united methodist 
church episcopal church united church of christ and christian 
church disciples of christ uphold choice about abortion and the 
legalizing of it 
the sevenmember american baptist task force including three 
supporters of legalized abortion three opponents and one 
undetermined about it has held hearings across the country 
gathered questionaires and a flood of letters 
mary mild staff assistant on the project at the denominations 
headquarters in valley forge pa said there has been some 
discontent with the previous stance of 1981 enough people were 
not happy with it as reflecting where we really are she said 
the revision expresses no opinion of the 1973 supreme court 
decision legalizing abortion neither for nor against but condemns 
harassing either abortion clinics or doctors refusing to do 
abortions 
the sevenpage statement stresses education and ministry to 
reinforce responsible sexuality to help those facing problem 
pregnancies and to provide needed financial aid to women carrying 
such pregnancies to birth 
while not citing any circumstances that justify abortion as was 
done previously the new statement urges a ministry of love and 
spiritual counsel to those who choose to terminate their 
pregnancies

jaime escalante focuses on the 
blackboard with absorbed frustration reporters and photographers 
have invaded his classroom and hes concerned his students are 
losing their concentration 
although his life and unorthodox teaching methods are the 
subject of the critically acclaimed film stand and deliver 
escalante has more important things on his mind like mathematics 
and helping his james garfield high school students to learn as 
much as they can 
we have so many people working at jack in the box fastfood 
restaurants and pumping gas he said like the movie teacher 
portrayed by actor edward james olmos escalante wants more for his 
students and pushes them to excel in math and use it as their 
ticket out of menial jobs 
its like a sport he said you have to practice every day 
to be in shape 
his scrapbooks chronicle the victories of his mathematical 
athletes photos show beaming students holding banners heralding 
their achievements 
each year the number of escalante students passing the advanced 
placement calculus test given by the educational testing service 
for college credit has grown tremendously 
in 1979 five students took the test and all had a passing mark 
of 3 or better by last year 87 garfield students passed the test 
higher than any other school in southern california 
the movie concerns an incident in 1982 when 18 students took 
the exam and all passed surprised that the predominantly hispanic 
class had performed so well in a school that was about to lose its 
academic accreditation the ets accused the students of cheating 
twelve took the retest and passed with either perfect scores of 
5 or near perfect scores of 4 
last year scores made by garfield students taking the advanced 
placement calculus test placed garfield second in the nation out of 
the 4197 schools with students taking the tough exam said janice 
gams with the educational testing service 
just 2 percent of american students even attempt the test 
this year a record 160 garfield students are expected to take 
the test and escalante has set his sights on attracting even more 
students to calculus classes in the 10 more years he plans to 
continue teaching 
hes your friend hes your mentor and hes your father 
said former student josie richkarday who was one of the 18 
students suspected of cheating 
he just didnt teach said richkarday 23 who is studying 
to be a math teacher herself he brought something out of me if 
youre willing to go 50 yards hell go 100 
escalante has seen stand and deliver four times and likes 
it although he says 90 percent is true and 10 percent is hype 
because the warner bros release depicts more gang activity than 
really exists and portrays the families and neighborhoods as more 
destitute than they really are 
his students have become doctors and engineers they work at the 
jet propulsion laboratory which does work for nasa and for trw 
inc and atlantic richfield co 
dr armando islas a 1976 garfield graduate and an oral surgeon 
with two offices in the los angeles area credits escalante with 
challenging him to be more than a c student with athletic talent 
he was a fantastic instructor islas said he kept you 
motivated and his method of teaching was kind of unorthodox but i 
think in that particular environment thats what you needed 
in the 14 years escalante has been at garfield he has watched 
the gang influence dissipate due mostly to a tough line by school 
administrators and teachers the graffiti is more or less gone 
and thanks in part to the reputation of escalantes math 
achievers the school is respected within the mostly hispanic 
barrio where neatly kept stucco homes reflect community pride 
the days when students didnt want to go to garfield are over 
said principal maria tostado who grew up in the area 
theres no longer the defeatist attitude that no matter what 
you do youre not going to get ahead she said today the school 
is wellknown for academic prowess 
escalante a 57yearold father of two sons was a respected 
teacher in bolivia for 11 years before coming to the united states 
at his wifes urging in 1964 once here he tried a career in 
computers but the work lacked the spirit of teaching 
i got real tired he said in an interview i didnt want 
to deal anymore with the printouts or schematics 
now he spends his days in a stagelike arena before as many as 
52 students who sit on tiered rows and demands that late comers 
get the chair a tots seat meant to embarrass tardy students 
into promptness 
his classroom is plastered with posters designed to motivate a 
foothigh banner curls around the rooms corners greeting students 
with calculus need not be made easy it is easy already 
another poster tells students what they can expect to feel if 
they master math feel ready to attend any college or university 
feel prepared to go into real estate business engineering feel 
really good about myself 
the students do feel good about themselves boredom is replaced 
with laughter smiles and friendly jests as escalante tries to 
reach them through cheers swats them with a battered and faded 
pillow practices an imaginary ski swish and does practically 
anything to promote learning 
he was given the nickname kimo sabe by four gang toughs in 
his class the name translates loosely from spanish as the one 
who knows hes accepted the nickname but shakes off such 
glorious titles as american hero which newsweek dubbed him in 
a recent story about the movie and teacher behind it 
what i tried to do is improve things in my school he said 
hes a master said tostado describing escalantes 
teaching hes a genius at it 
news crews file in and out of his classroom almost daily now 
but while the media intrusion disturbs him escalante believes the 
rewards from the movies exposure will offset the hollywood glare 
its going to motivate parents to control to help because 
the schools alone cannot educate he said its going to 
motivate the students the teachers are going to see its better to 
teach the way this guy does and and not from the desk

the working class neighborhood 
that taught edward james olmos respect for humanity and watched the 
miami vice star mature into an acclaimed actor is home to his 
latest movie 
olmos returned to an east los angeles high school last spring to 
make stand and deliver a movie about a magnetic demanding 
math teacher who led an unruly hispanic class to academic triumph 
in 1982 
the 41yearold actor was no stranger to the halls of garfield 
high school his cousin teaches computer science there only 1 
miles from his childhood home it is ethnically mixed like the 
neighborhood he remembers 
stand and deliver was a smash when it opened in los angeles 
it brought in 411000 during its first week last month averaging 
14000 at each of 30 theaters he said 
olmos an actor of mexicanamerican heritage who won an emmy 
award for his role as lt castillo on the nbctv series miami 
vice was delighted with the movie and its reception in his home 
area 
this film is probably the most inspirational film ive done to 
date he said of the warner bros release 
stand and deliver is about overcoming racial stigmas it 
advances the humanities something olmos said he holds close to his 
heart something he learned in a family of eight living in a 
neighborhood crowded with russian mexican jewish and american 
indian families 
olmos who coproduced and helped write the movie claims he is 
not making a political point 
im not a political animal he said its the advancement of 
the humanities through acting that inspires olmos 
its always been that way it serves me well and makes me 
stronger he said 
that doesnt mean i have to make message movies i think that 
art forms especially films should be used to entertain now if by 
chance your entertaining and allowing your audience to experience 
an event that has some value and some substance and some awareness 
to it well even better 
the criterion no 1 is the story if that story happens to 
be socially relevant well thats wonderful but if it isnt 
thats ok too 
stand and deliver is about an event that drew national 
attention to garfield high schools 1982 calculus class the 
predominantly hispanic class took and passed an advance placement 
calculus test in stark contrast to the rest of the school which 
faced loss of accreditation 
the 18 students who were badgered and inspired by computer 
specialistturnedteacher jaime escalante were stripped of their 
honors when the educational testing service which tests us 
students and provides their scores to colleges and universities 
accused the entire class of cheating 
in the movie olmos in his role as escalante accuses the 
educational testing service of racism students from wealthy 
beverly hills would not be questioned if they passed an advance 
placement calculus test but students with hispanic names from a 
barrio high school were suspect he says in the movie 
eventually the students are vindicated with a second test 
the movie is not meant to be manipulative olmos said it 
presents an event that allows you to experience with your own 
values 
we dont give results he said we only give the facts

the 1988 pontiac bonneville sse is more than a 
technology buffs dream come true 
its an impressive road car and comfortable large sedan that 
even a technophobe can appreciate 
inside the aerodynamically styled vehicle a driver can tune the 
radio without taking his hands off the steering wheel the radio 
buttons are built into the wheel around the horn an electronic 
compass senses the earths magnetic field thus changes in the 
sses direction are continuously displayed on an electronic map on 
the dashboard 
and a new smooth fuelinjected 3800 v6 wonderfully firm 
suspension goodyear eagle gt4 radial tires and antilock brakes 
join to provide stable road handling and enjoyable ride 
yes the sse is a car to show off to friends and neighbors but 
it doesnt come cheaply base price is 21879 
you get what you pay for the sse is so loaded with standard 
equipment there are only three options alarm system interior 
leather and power sunroof 
additionally the sse is priced below many of its foreign 
competitors such as the audi 5000 which starts at more than 
22000 and volvo 760 which starts around 31200 
new for the 1988 model year the sse is the top of the 
bonneville line which was redesigned inside and out for the 1987 
model year 
the lowestpriced bonneville the le has a base price of 
14099 and nearly the same stylish exterior as the sse but without 
the fancy handling package and technology frills 
theres also a middle offering the bonneville se that starts 
at 16299 and shares the new 38liter v6 with the sse but not the 
same suspension 
pontiac a division of general motors corp expects to build 
only 14000 bonneville sses this model year and spokesman reginald 
harris says we expect to sell them all with no problem the 
initial reception to the car has been great exceeding our 
forecast 
pontiac projects total bonneville sales this model year of 
110000 up from 93575 in the 1987 model year he added 
bonnevilles rank third in volume at pontiac behind the grand am 
and pontiac 6000 models 
the majority of buyers targeted for the 1988 bonnevilles are 
male and married pontiac says average age is 49 for the le and 45 
for the sse the division looks for 44 percent of the le buyers and 
64 percent of the sse buyers to be college graduates 
average household income of targeted buyers is 41000 for the 
le and 61000 for the sse many of these sse buyers are 
intenders of highlevel imports who previously havent had a 
domestic choice the division said theyre attracted to very 
expressive styling and are very discriminating in quality and 
function of features 
the test bonneville sse was fun though there were a few 
glitches at night the dashboard lit up like a christmas tree 
because of all the electronics and buttons including those for 
automatic heat and air conditioning 
however one of the buttons for setting interior temperature 
sometimes stuck 
an electronic screen on the dashboard indicated when the next 
oil change tire rotation and tuneup were needed and monitored 
doors and the trunk to make sure they were secured 
but i drove 5 miles with the trunk ajar and no warning appeared 
on the screen 
the 10way adjustable front bucket seats were roomy and had 
countless comfortable settings including three buttons for power 
lumbar support at three different spots in the back of the seats 
but the power headrests were bulkier than i was used to and i 
found myself craning to look around them when backing up 
still the trunk was flat and spacious and the delco sound 
system was superb 
there was comfortable seating in the rear and a rear arm 
restconsole provided a spot for beverages and storage if only two 
people rode back there 
however because the model is so new consumer reports does not 
yet have repair records

interest rates are not headed skyward despite a 
slight uptick in recent weeks economists say 
interest rates rise when lenders become fearful of inflation 
but so far inflation remains under control in spite of surprisingly 
strong economic growth a number of economists interviewed tuesday 
said 
consumer prices are rising at an annual rate of between 4 
percent and 45 percent roughly the same as they have for the past 
three years and that has allowed americans to enjoy a rare

oil futures prices have skidded below the 
17abarrel range following a kuwaiti news report that opecs 
pricing committee would not recommend a full ministerial conference 
of the cartel at its april 9 meeting 
on the new york mercantile exchange the may delivery price of 
west texas intermediate crude oil fell 22 cents per barrel to 
1679 on tuesday most of the drop came in the afternoon but 
volume was relatively light 
among refined products traded on the exchange wholesale no 2 
heating oil fell 080 cent a gallon to 4520 cents and unleaded 
gasoline fell 071 cent a gallon to 4864 cents 
the oil market has been focusing on organization of petroleum 
exporting countries price and production policies because of a 
persistent output glut and widespread reports of cheating among the 
cartels 13 members on their selfimposed production limits 
the april 9 meeting in vienna had incited some hope that opec 
would act aggressively to stabilize prices and enforce production 
discipline to limit excessive supplies traders said the kuwaiti 
news report dampened the optimism and forced a selloff in the 
futures market 
but they said the light volume of trading suggested most oil 
market participants are reluctant to buy or sell pending the 
outcome of the price committee meeting 
the committee has no power to alter opec policy but it can call

reed funks grass has shimmered in the rose 
bowl in yankee stadium on the masters golf course and across 
thousands of private lawns 
hes got a famous touch with turf but the 59yearold 
researcher and academician says the grass is always greener 
somewhere else 
you start out with a variety and then immediately start 
working on a replacement thats better because nothing is 
perfect he said 
colleagues and others involved in the turf industry say funk has 
taken an unknown field and made it his own revolutionizing the 
development of grass and gaining international prominence in the 
process 
a rutgers university researcher and turf science professor funk 
has been developing scores of grass varieties for more than 20 
years in his new brunswick offices and on 200 acres of test fields 
in adelphia funk combines various strains of grass seed in search 
of the best combination 
funk has created finetextured turf grasses lush dark green 
grasses shade and droughttolerant grasses and grasses that repel 
disease and insects bearing such names as rebel gator and prelude 
he is often referred to as the albert einstein of the seed 
industry said john morrissey executive vice president of lofts 
seed inc of bound brook there is nobody probably in the world 
who is as knowledgeable on new varieties in the turf grass 
industry 
morrissey who has done business with and consulted funk for 
about 20 years said funks students are courted heavily by the 
grass seed industry because of his track record 
funks work and the work of students and faculty in the cook 
college soils and crops department at rutgers have kept hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in royalties flowing into the universitys 
turf research department 
hes one of these fellows whos intelligent and he works 
efficiently said ralph engel who retired two years ago after 
serving as a longtime professor of turf science at rutgers 
he works lots of hours and hes put it all together said 
engel a 25year associate of funk 
when the golf worlds luminaries descend on the augusta national 
course in georgia for the masters tournament on thursday they will 
tread a course seeded partly with funks palmer strain named after 
golf legend arnold palmer the strain carpets many courses 
throughout the northeast funk says 
funks adelphi bluegrass a hybrid of kentucky bluegrass long 
has been used by groundskeepers at shea stadium in flushing ny 
said stadium manager john mccarthy 
its a sturdy grass and ideal for the temperature of new 
york mccarthy said 
funk gravitated to turf research after an early life dominated 
by agriculture he was raised on a 600acre dairy farm in richmond 
utah and earned undergraduate and masters degrees in agronomy 
from utah state university 
after earning his doctorate from rutgers in 1961 funk narrowly 
missed getting an appointment to research sugarcane growth in 
hawaii but the miss freed him to become rutgers first fulltime 
scientist working with turf grasses 
he said his first creation to achieve widescale popularity was 
the manhattan perennial rye grass in 1967 which was considered a 
marked improvement over other rye grasses funk said that grass 
still is used in european soccer stadiums 
this spring funks pinnacle grass which is resistant to a 
number of insects should start cropping up on lawns parks and 
cemeteries in the northeast 
over the past 20 years funk has become highly regarded for his 
ability to adapt grasses to the needs of different climates and 
situations said morrissey of lofts seeds 
but funks colleagues say he never is satisfied and they 
repeatedly are disarmed by his humility despite his grand 
reputation and stellar credentials 
hes the first one weve looked to said morrissey the 
great leader is funk who has developed probably more proprietary 
turf types than any one in the world

interest rates have edged higher in recent 
weeks but most economists see no cause for alarm because there is 
little evidence that the driving force of the rise is higher 
inflation 
inflation remains under control in spite of surprisingly strong 
economic growth economists say 
there is a lot of skepticism about inflation i think its 
healthy but probably unwarranted thomas f carpenter vice 
president and economics director for asb capital management a 
washingtonbased pension fund manager said tuesday 
consumer prices are rising at an annual rate of about 4 percent 
to 45 percent roughly the same as in the past three years 
the concern about inflation is a sharp contrast to opinions that 
prevailed after the oct 19 stock market crash then interest 
rates fell because investors felt the crash might trigger a 
recession and curb inflation 
rates for 30year fixedrate mortgages fell from about 116 
percent just before the stock market crash last october to a little 
over 98 percent by february according to the federal home loan 
mortgage corp known as freddie mac 
instead of crashing though the economy has created more than 1 
million jobs since october the jobless rate fell to 56 percent in 
march the lowest in nine years 
some investors changed their minds and decided the economy was 
in danger of overheating and high inflation mortgage rates 
consequently have crept back to just over 10 percent nationwide as 
of april 1 freddie mac says 
inflation fears drive up interest rates because investors demand 
higher yields to make up for the erosion of the value of 
fixedincome investments that inflation causes 
americans are paying unusually high interest rates now because 
creditmarket investors were burned by doubledigit inflation in 
the 1970s and early 1980s and keep thinking those days might come 
again 
despite the fears of last october many economists now have 
concluded the stock market crash was good for the economy because 
it cooled off an economy that was overheating 
steep recessions generally are preceded by inflationary 
overheating which leads to high interest rates that in turn choke 
off economic growth 
in the current economy inflation hasnt had a chance to 
accelerate because the credit markets have reacted so quickly to 
it driving up interest rates and cooling the economy before it 
overheats said alan lerner a managing director and financial 
economist for bankers trust co 
in a sense lerner said the economy has become selfcorrecting 
through the bond markets sensitivity to inflation that may 
explain why the economy remains in the longest peacetime expansion 
of the 20th century 
the bond market is running the economic show both globally and 
domestically carpenter said bond managers in effect are in 
the drivers seat 
some economists believe the federal reserve the nations 
central bank has engineered the recent uptick in interest rates 
according to that theory the fed is trying to prove its 
inflationfighting credentials to the bond market it is heading 
off a steep rise in interest rates over the long term by pushing 
them up slightly in the short term 
the federal reserve reaction is appropriate said george 
gols an analyst for arthur d little inc in boston to prepare 
for inflationary surges is much better than to do it afterward 
but other economists say fed action if any has been modest 
one reason might be that any attempt by the fed to cool off the 
economy with higher interest rates would punish the housing market 
which is relatively weak 
if the fed is doing anything theyre just raising the flag 
and saying hey were here were not oblivious to whats going 
on in the world said robert chandross chief economist in the 
north american head office of lloyds bank of london 
the yield of the widely watched 30year treasury bond has ticked 
up to about 89 percent this week from a recent low of less than 
83 percent in early february 
carpenter said the bond probably would go no higher than 93 
percent and no lower than 83 percent in the rest of 1988 lerner 
said it might edge up to 95 or even 97 percent by the end of the 
year gols who is in a small minority of economists predicting a 
recession by the end of 1988 predicted the long bonds yield would 
rise slightly and then trend steadily downward

four days after he won his fight for federated 
department stores inc robert campeau was looking to expand the 
retailers top performers while cutting costs throughout the 
company 
the chairman of campeau corp said tuesday that federateds 
bloomingdales division which now has 17 stores potentially could 
be a national chain and said he was considering opening branches in 
canada as well 
but campeau told a news conference expansion would come second 
to costcutting and productivity 
our emphasis in the future is to raise the sales per square 
foot campeau said 
campeau and robert morosky the president of campeaus allied 
stores unit said they would review each of federateds divisions 
to see where improvements could be made and did not rule out 
layoffs 
there will be some streamlining campeau said you cannot 
survive and compete by having jobs and jobs and jobs 
that doesnt mean we will be laying off en masse he said 
we do want to expand 
federated the nations fifth largest retailer agreed friday to 
be taken over by campeau a torontobased developer in a 658 
billion buyout the agreement ended a 2monthlong battle that 
included a bidding war between campeau and rh macy amp co inc 
campeau said his company planned to retain federateds ralphs 
supermarkets division in california the 127store chain was among 
the divisions campeau had been expected to sell when it began its 
tender offer 
campeau said ralphs would be sold into a wholly owned campeau 
corp subsidiary with the proceeds of the sale used to help pay 
for the federated acquisition 
morosky reiterated that campeau planned to retain six federated 
department store divisions bloomingdales abraham amp straus 
richs burdines goldsmiths and lazarus but some stores in 
those divisions may be shut morosky said 
maybe theyre better off as real estate locations he said 
he declined to say which stores might be targeted for closing 
campeau was expected to deal with federated as he did allied 
after it was acquired in 1986 by paring its unprofitable stores 
campeau already has agreed to sell four of federateds 
department store divisions and expects to sell its gold circle 
discount stores and its specialty store operations as well morosky 
said walmart stores inc and gold circles management have 
expressed interest in the 76store chain 
campeau refused to discuss a meeting he held with macy chairman 
edward finkelstein last thursday during which their takeover fight 
was resolved but described finkelstein as relieved and 
himself as delighted 
campeau said the takeover will cost his company a total of 88 
billion including the price of federated shares refinancing of 
debt and expenses he said he expected earnings of 375 million to 
400 million from the combined operations of allied and federated 
based on the companies 1987 sales 
he said he did not expect to use junkbond financing in the 
federated acquisition except in the ralphs transaction

action but its executives also declined to comment on what may 
have led to the decision 
but one source familiar with the events who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said the company was unhappy with saatchis ads for 
northwest which announced plans two weeks ago to ban smoking on 
most of its north american flights starting april 23 
the airline has promoted the plan heavily in print and broadcast 
ads the plan goes farther than required by government regulations 
which ban smoking on flights of less than two hours starting later 
this month 
in one television commercial announcing the plans a lone smoker 
is shown puffing on a cigarette on an airplane 
as the camera pans back up the aisle a narrator announces 
northwests plans to offer a smokefree environment on all of 
its north american flights the other passengers stand up and 
applaud 
upset is too mild a term the source said when asked to 
describe rjrs reaction to saatchis work for northwest 
the new york times quoted an rjr nabisco employee who asked not 
to be identified in todays editions as saying the company did 
take away saatchis assignments because of the northwest ads but 
mainly because the company had not been told of them in advance 
ironically saatchi amp saatchi dfs new york unit saatchi amp 
saatchi dfs compton does no cigarette advertising for rjr nabisco 
whose rj reynolds tobacco unit markets camel winston salem and 
vantage cigarettes 
saatchi does create advertising for true cigarettes which are 
made by loews corps lorillard division an rjr competitor 
saatchis assignments for rjr nabisco include life savers roll 
candy care free sugarless chewing gum and oreo chips ahoy and 
almost home cookies 
saatchi amp saatchi dfss us billings amount to about 16 
billion according to the trade journal advertising age it is a

billion hostile takeover attempt by british industrialist brian c 
beazer and the investment firm shearson lehman hutton inc

not take a position on the outstanding hostile bid by the beazer 
group because of the court ruling other outstanding litigation and 
koppers ongoing attempts to seek alternative courses of action 
us 9th circuit court of appeals judges alfred t goodwin and 
harry pregerson late tuesday denied the beazer groups appeal of a 
lower court order issued monday that blocked its 60 a share 
hostile tender offer 
the onesentence ruling was announced from the appeal courts 
headquarters in san francisco 
us district judge manuel real in los angeles issued a 
preliminary injunction suspending the tender offer indefinitely 
because of on antitrust questions he issued the order after 
koppers argued that competition could be weakened in the local 
market for sand gravel and hard stone for construction if 
california properties of beazer and koppers were combined 
attorneys for the beazer group had argued that a delay in 
closing the tender offer could jeopardize financing for the 
takeover

the hostile tender offer or beazers proposal to negotiate a 
friendly merger with the pittsburgh construction materials and 
chemicals company she said 
beazer on the other hand declined to discuss anything but the 
takeover or a friendly deal 
beazer was in pittsburgh testifying before us district judge 
maurice cohill in a hearing on koppers lawsuit contending the 
beazer group violated securities laws in launching its tender offer 
march 3 the offer expires at midnight edt thursday

koppers has disputed the accuracy of disclosures made in 
documents issued in conjunction with the tender offer 
in his testimony beazer identified documents suggesting 
koppers chemicals businesses could be sold after the takeover for 
as much as 700 million the takeover plan calls for getting at 
least 400 million for those operations although beazer said no 
serious bidders had yet been found

the arizona court of appeals has ruled 
that honeywell inc does not have to pay worker compensation to a 
model employee who fainted struck his head and suffered severe and 
permanent brain damage after being told he was being demoted 
the court ruled tuesday in a case involving kenneth murphy who 
had worked for honeywell for 19 years and was described by his 
supervisor jim enk as a good punctual employee who never 
complained and appeared to enjoy his work 
we conclude that claimants physical injury did not result 
from an unexpected unusual or extraordinary stress related to 
employment judge j thomas brooks wrote in the threemember 
courts unanimous ruling the physical injury is therefore 
noncompensable as an industrial injury 
murphys attorney walter ulman called tuesdays decision 
disappointing but not too surprising in light of precedents and 
said he anticpated an appeal to the state supreme court 
murphy who is described as being in a vegatative state was 
injured aug 8 1985 when enk told him that he was being reassigned 
in a costcutting move to a job that required different skills and 
carried a onethird cut in pay the change also meant working for a 
new manager reputed to be a strict disciplinarian and about whom 
murphy already had expressed concern 
enk turned to walk away and claimaint took two or three steps 
after him brooks wrote enk then turned back to speak with 
claimant again and saw him falling straight over backwards 
claimants head struck the tilecovered concrete floor causing 
permanent brain damage 
rumors about pending job cuts had been circulating at honeywell 
for one or two months and murphy was worried about financial 
problems if he were displaced according to court records he also 
feared a new job might lead to a recurrence of earlier 
workrelated hernia problems 
expert witnesses who testified on murphys behalf said the faint 
stemmed from emotional shock and his present condition was unlikely 
to improve 
but the judges said previous state supreme court rulings made it 
clear that physical injuries caused by jobrelated emotional stress 
need not be compensated unless the stress is unusual unexpected 
or extraordinary 
and they said that threatened economic hardship including 
such naturally traumatic events as layoffs and plant closures may 
indeed expose the affected workers to varying degrees of emotional 
distress but are not sufficiently unexpected unusual or 
extraordinary in modern society to warrant compensability as an 
industrial injury 
a switchboard operator at honeywells phoenixarea headquarters 
said no one was available for comment immediately

united auto workers union officials 
gathering today to formulate contract demands for chrysler corp 
also prepared for a potentially bitter debate over the contract 
status of workers at the companys kenosha wis plant 
separately uaw vice president marc stepp said the union may 
seek contract provisions to guarantee that workers receive 
profitsharing bonuses whenever chrysler executives receive 
bonuses regardless of the companys performance 
union representatives began gathering tuesday to prepare for the 
april 18th opening of contract talks with the nations 
thirdlargest automaker 
in addition to contract demands the 140member uaw national 
chrysler council also was faced with the potentially divisive issue 
of whether 800 to 1000 former american motors corp workers in 
kenosha should be brought under the national chrysler contract 
chrysler which bought amc last year decided earlier this year 
to close a 5500worker assembly plant in kenosha by years end 
leaving only an engine plant and some metalstamping operations 
operating 
stepp said he wants to include the remaining workers 
represented by uaw local 72 under the chrysler contract which 
covers 59500 active and 8000 laidoff workers at 49 local unions 
he said the kenosha workers now are chrysler employees and he wants 
to prevent chrysler from moving their work they build engines for 
jeeps assembled at a plant in toledo ohio to factories in mexico 
or canada 
but other chrysler workers said admitting the kenosha workers 
would take jobs away from workers laid off from chrysler plants 
workers from closed chrysler plants have the right to move into 
jobs that open through attrition at other factories a privilege 
that would be extended to the kenosha workers if they came under 
the national pact 
chrysler workers said the issue was sensitive because of the 
automakers recent attempt to sell its 28000worker acustar inc 
parts subsidiary chrysler terminated that proposal in early march 
in the face of bitter uaw opposition including the threat of 
crippling plantbyplant strikes 
how can you accept them into the chrysler council when our 
people arent even secure yet acustar or chrysler said tony 
defrancesco bargaining chairman of local 624 at chrysler new 
process gear plant in syracuse ny 
the syracuse plant which makes manual frontwheeldrive 
transmissions is part of acustar 
but stepp said he believed much of the opposition came from fear 
that the soontobelaidoff kenosha assembly workers also would be 
included which they would not 
he also argued that the uaw historically has brought business 
and plants purchased by automakers such as the syracuse plant 
under those companies national contracts usually resulting in 
increased wages and benefits for the new additions 
the council was to discuss proposed demands today and vote on a 
demand package thursday stepp said the package which in most ways 
will mirror contracts signed last fall at general motors corp and 
ford motor co also may seek to guarantee workers a share of 
profits whenever corporate executives receive bonuses 
the ford and gm contracts include worker profitsharing payments 
based on sales and the companies financial performance but stepp 
said that because executives receive bonuses regardless of their 
companies performance so should workers 
the uaw also wants to close potential loopholes that have 
appeared in the job protection provisions in the ford and gm 
contracts stepp said 
both pacts forbid plant closings that were not announced before 
last years negotiations but allow workers to be laid off if sales 
of a product fall 
gm has said it will idle two plants indefinitely later this year 
because sales of their products are slow

gd searle amp co is broadening its program to 
give free drugs to the the poor to include all of its medication 
for heart disease 
last year searle began providing its high blood pressure 
medicine to people who could not afford to buy it and had no 
insurance now all seven of its drugs that treat cardiovascular 
problems will be available to poor people without charge said dr 
sheldon g gilgore chairman and chief executive officer 
i personally believe that all drugs that treat 
lifethreatening diseases should be involved gilgore said in a 
telephone interview tuesday but cardiovascular drugs are about 
all we make 
no one who suffers from cardiovascular disease should be denied 
medication because they cant afford it he said 
searle which is based in skokie ill is inviting all 
physicians in the nation to participate in the program which cost 
the company 9 million last year 
bill greener a senior vice president said searle does not know 
how much the expanded program will cost but he said the company 
expects it will double the existing program 
theres no money limit on it he said 
gilgore said the company will deliver 1 million worth of 
certificates to clinics and hospitals in 10 major cities today to 
dramatize the expansion of its patient in need program 
any physician clinic or hospital in the nation may request 
searle certificates for needy patients 
the company sets broad guidelines for patients to qualify but 
leaves it up to the individual physician to make the decision 
the company is mailing instructions to doctors that classify 
poor people as those with annual household incomes of 8000 for 
one or two people or 11000 for three or more family members to 
qualify patients must not have insurance or other assistance that 
would pay for the drug 
its up to the doctor to determine but the patient doesnt 
have to bring in tax returns or anything like that said gilgore 
we believe the doctor knows who his poor patients are 
searle launched the pilot program with two drugs that treat high 
blood pressure in february 1987 twentythousand patients have 
received free medication 
the new expanded program includes five additional products used 
to treat high blood pressure angina arrhythmias and congestive 
heart failure 
the american pharmaceutical industry can satisfy the unmet 
prescription needs of the medically indigent patient population in 
this country gilgore said 
judee shuler of the pharmaceutical manufacturers association in 
washington dc said tuesday that all pharmaceutical companies do 
something but searle is more extensive at working with the 
healthcare delivery system 
she said the other companies will help out in individual need 
cases or in thirdworld countries but she said she knows of no 
other pharmaceutical company doing the same kind of work as searle 
searle is a researchbased company which develops manufactures 
and markets prescription pharmaceuticals worldwide it is a wholly 
owned subsidiary of monsanto co 
twothirds of searles sales are in cardiovascular drugs 
greener said the other third is primarily oral contraceptives he 
said

a bitter power struggle is occurring 
over the publishing empire built by the late axel springer with 
his wife two friends and a longtime media industry rival fighting 
for control of the company 
the highly successful springer empire which has annual sales of 
about 16 billion publishes west germanys largest daily 
newspaper bild and dozens of other masscirculation publications 
leo kirch another wealthy media entrepreneur pooled his 
springer shares with those of brothers franz and frieder burda 
also publishers last month to amass a stake larger than that of 
springers heirs 
west german news media have dubbed the resulting power struggle 
dallas on the elbe in reference to the popular american soap 
opera and to the location of hamburg where springer has 
publishing plants on the elbe river i think this dispute 
will simmer down and the sooner the better ernst cramer 
advisor to the springer family told the associated press in a 
telephone interview from his west berlin office 
cramer played down the feud saying the interests of the 
major shareholders are all the same for the company to remain 
successful this matter is not insurmountable 
 
but springers widow 45yearold friede springer has said in 
west german interviews that the affair has angered her 
i am infinitely disappointed with the burdas the march 28 
issue of the newsmagazine der spiegel quoted her as saying i 
never imagined they would pull this kind of thing 
a spokeswoman for kirch armgard von burgsdorff insisted kirch 
is interested only in the springer companys continued success 
the purpose of the agreement with the burda brothers is to 
establish a stable majority and to provide the publishing house 
with a leading role in a changing media world she told the ap in 
a telephone interview from kirchs munich office 
powers within the company have squabbled since 73yearold axel 
springer died on sept 22 1985 leaving his wife and two sons as 
direct heirs 
springer built a familyowned empire that in addition to the 5 
million dailycirculation bild includes the respected conservative 
daily die welt 
the day he died the company stated that a few weeks earlier 
springer had converted the company into a joint stock company 
to safeguard the future of his holdings among the stockholders 
were the burda brothers and kirch 
under a complicated formula springers heirs and executors 
received control of about 26 percent of the companys shares the 
burda brothers 259 percent and kirch 10 percent the rest went to 
the stock exchange 
kirch says that in addition to his 10 percent share he has 
obtained support from owners of another 16 percent of springer 
stock 
mrs burgsdorff said the springer heirs had agreed verbally in 
1986 that kirch should have a stake of up to 26 percent but the 
family later changed its mind she said kirch then began 
discussions with the burdas 
the axel springer verlag company is overseen by a supervisory 
board whose members include the burdas and mrs springer but not 
kirch 
kirch is involved in film distribution and production and other 
media areas the burda family owns the west german bunte 
magazine and other publications 
despite gaining more support through the burdas and other 
shareholders kirch has not yet been able to overcome mrs 
springers opposition to his obtaining a seat on the supervisory 
board 
mrs burgsdorff said axel springer had included kirch in the 
shareholding formula because he knew leo kirch would be a strong 
media personality in the future 
neither mrs springer nor the burda brothers could be reached 
for comment on tuesday 
cramer the springer family advisor said for the family the 
legacy of axel springer is important 
but he added this dispute almost had to come before it was 
owned by a family now we are a shareholders company

company 
nazer took over from john j kelberer who headed aramco for 10 
years aramco president ali i naimi will succeed kelberer as chief 
executive 
the appointment of nazer announced late tuesday in houston 
reflects the shrinking role in aramco of the four big us oil 
companies that were formerly partners in the venture exxon corp 
texaco inc chevron corp and mobil corp 
the saudi government has gradually taken over control of aramco 
from the four companies starting in the 1970s so that it is now 
100 percent saudiowned the four oil majors now mainly provide 
technical assistance to the saudis 
kelberer will remain on the board of directors as vice chairman 
although he has effectively retired 
kelberer has undergone a number of major surgical operations in 
recent years and is understood to have sought retirement after 
turning 60 two years ago he has worked in saudi arabia for more 
than 37 years as aramcos chairman and chief executive for the 
past decade 
the change in kelberers position leaves only two americans in 
operating positions equal to vice president or higher at aramco 
headquarters in dhahran of aramcos 42000 or so employees in 
saudi arabia only about 2500 are americans 
the saudi government appointed nazer oil minister in november 
1986 replacing sheik ahmed zaki yamani 
nazer is studying a possible reorganization of the kingdoms oil 
industry according to us sources the new structure which is 
expected to include the creation of a saudi national oil company 
could be built on either aramco or petromin the sources said 
petromin is the marketing company for saudi petroleum products 
in addition to his posts as oil minister and aramco chairman 
nazer also heads petromin and the royal commission for jubail and

despite a slight drop in the european 
economic communitys economic sentiment indicator in february the 
12nation trading bloc is not heading for a recession the eec 
reported wednesday 
the eec commission citing the latest business and consumer 
survey said there were no signs of an approaching recession 
it said the stock market crash and the turbulence on 
foreignexchange markets last fall affected economic performance 
less than originally feared 
the commission said the eecs economic indicator which is based 
partly on the results of the survey dropped to 1027 in february 
from 1029 in january but was above the 1026 level recorded in 
november 1987 after the october crash 
the indicator comprises an industrial confidence indicator a 
construction confidence indicator a consumer confidence indicator 
and stock price indexes 
eec economists reported that production expectations continued 
to point toward further growth over the next few months while the 
outlook for exports looked brighter than anticipated 
lowerthanexpected production results in britain since last

northwest airlines announced a twomonth 
discount that will give senior citizens a percentage off their fare 
that matches their age 
for example a 65yearold will receive a 65 percent discount 
and a 100yearold will fly free the airline said tuesday 
the stock phrase im not getting older just better 
deserves an updating said ab magary executive vice president 
of marketing for northwest the older you are the greater your 
discount gets 
the discount which covers people aged 65 and older is good 
from april 12 through june 8 and applies to all full economy fares 
on northwests domestic flights the fares may be used every day 
except fridays and sundays and may 31 and reservations must be 
made and tickets purchased at least seven days in advance 
travel must include at least two nights stay before returning 
and must be concluded by june 8 
magary said the idea is to stimulate discretionary travel until 
the peak summer season begins in june 
with that goal in mind eastern airlines and continental 
airlines both subsidiaries of giant texas air corp announced 
tuesday that they are reducing fares for the next two months on 
tickets carrying restrictions used mainly by vacationers american 
airlines and united airlines made similar fare cuts 
texas airs spring sales are for travel between april 18 and 
june 15 with no oneway fare greater than 99 for travel anywhere 
in the mainland united states 
the discount fares carry numerous restrictions and are not 
refundable tickets must be purchased in the next nine days 
magary said tuesday that northwest will match the eastern and 
continental fares in most northwest markets northwest was alone in 
offering the senior citizen discounts 
magary said another goal of the discount program is to introduce 
worldhorizons a frequentflier program for seniors modeled after 
similar plans at other airlines seniors who enroll in the 
northwest plan which begins june 1 can obtain discounted fares on 
many northwest flights

for generations the unwritten code of conduct 
among bankers rendered hostile takeovers virtually taboo that is 
until the oldest bank in the country saw fit to break with 
tradition 
bank of new york co founded by alexander hamilton eight years 
after the the declaration of independence was signed and so 
ingrained in tradition it was sometimes dubbed the sleeping giant 
startled its colleagues by making a brash move for control of rival 
irving bank corp last fall 
the joke around bank of new york and elsewhere had been that 
before hamilton was killed in a duel he told his employees not to 
do anything until he returned and that was the way business has 
been conducted ever since 
thats the impression a lot of people on the outside looking 
in have had of the bank of new york said company spokesman owen 
brady of course thats not true 
under the leadership of j carter bacot since 1982 bank of new 
york has moved to expand its market its twicerevised tender offer 
for irving of 108 billion began last month with regulatory 
approval but without irvings blessings 
although it wasnt the first hostile bank bid it is the largest 
deal of its kind to have progressed this far in a closeknit 
industry that tries to avoid controversy 
banking analysts say hostile bids could become more commonplace 
particularly among aggressive regional institutions although they 
dont foresee the same type of takeover frenzy prevalent in other 
industries since the oct 19 stock market crash made share prices 
attractive 
the trend is evolutionary not revolutionary said james j 
mcdermott jr an analyst with keefe bruyette amp woods however 
we do think that the ground has been broken with bank of new york 
and that under the appropriate financial circumstances we could see 
other hostile offers 
the federal reserves approval of the bank of new york bid in 
which the fed declined to make any distinction between a friendly 
or hostile offer may encourage other institutions to take chances 
on takeovers even under stormy conditions 
banks have been merging under friendly terms at a fierce clip 
in recent years to keep pace with economic conditions interstate 
banking law and new types of nonbank competitors like sears 
roebuck amp co the industry also has been struggling with 
deteriorating profits due to shaky loans to third world countries 
and to depressed domestic oil and farm regions 
since 1982 banks have led the nation in mergers and 
acquisitions with an average 260 friendly deals a year during that 
period many more are expected as more states open their doors to 
outsiders 
despite the motivations the nations 14000 commercial banks 
face significant hurdles in the merger process that other 
industries dont have to clear 
for one thing banks have to go through a laundry list of local 
and government regulations not to mention waiting periods and 
certain capital requirements before even trying to win over 
shareholders 
among the agencies to pass judgment are the fed state banking 
boards securities and exchange commission and in some cases local 
community groups and depending on the banks charter the 
comptroller of the currency also could step in 
its like a 12course meal its very easy to overcook and 
undercook at any given time and getting them off the table at the 
right times is not easy said michael rosen a boston attorney 
specializing in bank mergers 
banking is really in a way quasipublic its different from 
other businesses it banks coexistence is definitely more than a 
gentlemens agreement 
unlike other businesses which for the most part can continue 
selling or manufacturing uninterrupted banks have to worry about 
maintaining their trademark personal service 
the banking business is really a people business 
explained stephen berman an analyst with county securities usa 
as a rule a bank has gotten to the position its in based on its 
people and management 
the depature of certain managers after a hostile takeover for 
instance could jeopardize a loan agreement that might have been in 
the works or force wary customers to move their deposits elsewhere 
he said 
berman also noted that hostile suitors in particular who are 
not privy to all of a target banks books face additional obstacles 
a banks assets are much more difficult to judge than an 
industrial company he said the principal asset of a 
banking company is that loan portfolio composed of thousands of 
individual loans when you get down to it we know little about 
them 
in the proposed bank of new yorkirving merger many analysts 
agree that a combination of the two wouldnt be such a bad idea 
since both new york banks operate in a similar marketplace and 
offer similar services like securities processing 
more to the point irving has been an underperforming 
institution said mcdermott 
but most analysts are split as to whether bank of new york will 
succeed in creating one of the nations 15th largest bank holding 
companies with assets of more than 40 billion 
bank of new yorks current offer of 15 in cash and 1575 
shares of its own stock for each of irvings roughly 181 million 
common shares outstanding has been denounced as inadequate by 
irvings board of directors 
irving which was founded in 1851 and also criticized as being a 
sleeper has stressed its desire to remain independent 
although it said it was talking with other parties and may seek a 
white knight or friendly merger partner as an alternative to 
bank of new york 
it has taken a number of steps to spurn bank of new yorks 
advances including instituting an antitakeover poison pill 
intended to make any hostile buyout prohibitively expensive and 
filing suit to block a proxy solicitation by bank of new york 
shareholders are scheduled to vote on bank of new yorks proposed 
slate of 16 nominees to irvings board in about two weeks 
meanwhile industry watchers say that if bank of new york 
succeeds it will be especially noteworthy given the track record 
of similar proposals 
two years ago first interstate bancorp made an unsolicited 32 
billion bid for ailing bankamerica corp but the proposal was 
spurned and the offer withdrawn last year banc one corp became 
marine corps white knight after marshall amp ilsley corp made a 
560 million cash and stock offer 
in fact since 1981 there have only been three significant 
successful hostile deals although all have been under 100 
million according to mergers amp acquisitions magazine 
all bankers know each other they all go to the same social 
events its not easy to be an outcast said rosen

the feds are finally getting glenn turners 
castle 
a federal court and the internal revenue service have begun 
foreclosure proceedings on the threestory longuncompleted castle 
owned by the hillbilly entrepreneur who made and lost a fortune by 
selling motivationaltraining and cosmetics franchises in the 1970s 
the irs has been trying for 10 years to collect a 15 million 
backtaxes claim against turner 53 who was in and out of trouble 
with the law for years because of what investigators said were 
illegal pyramid schemes that defrauded thousands of investors 
he is currently serving a sevenyear prison term in arizona on 
fraud convictions 
now one of his prized possessions the 16room castle and 79 
surrounding acres on bear gulley lake in neighboring seminole 
county fla is being sold at auction to satisfy an irs judgment 
against him in us district court in orlando 
but the irs figures it will be lucky to get even a fraction of 
the final amount set by the court 9275 million 
the estate was appraised by the county at 113 million in 1987 
and recent appraisals by private companies list its value at 
between 16 million and 2 million 
senior us district judge george young will hold a hearing 
april 26 to decide if two bids for the property or any new ones 
made in the interim will be accepted 
once the property is sold seminole county has the right to be 
paid first from the proceeds county tax collector g troy ray said 
about 16900 in unpaid property taxes is owed on the property for 
1987 
turner and his family havent paid property taxes since 1979 
but private investors have bought tax certificates equal to the 
back taxes each year under such an arrangement the investors pay 
the taxes and earn 18 percent interest until the property is sold 
and the tax funds are paid back to them 
those tax payments will come from the sale too 
court documents indicate there are dozens of other turner 
creditors but it is unlikely that they will be paid until all of 
the irs judgment is satisfied officials said 
bids on the castle property will be advertised over the next few 
weeks to notify any potential bidders of the pending sale besides 
the castle there is a boathouse with a threebedroom apartment and 
a stable 
the castle and boathouse have been vacant for several years and 
the castle has been used only for tours and charitable events 
turners financial empire crumbled in 1973 after he reportedly 
made about 300 million through aggressive marketing of his 
orlandobased dare to be great motivational classes and koscot 
cosmetics distributorships 
the selfstyled country boy son of a south carolina 
sharecropper rose to fame through inspirational speeches that 
promised great wealth if people bought distributorships in his 
operations 
the companies collapsed under lawsuits filed by investors and 
investigations by state and federal agencies 
turner and a longtime partner edward rector 57 were sentenced 
to prison in arizona on charges of operating a pyramid scheme there 
and defrauding investors through a later selfmotivational company

the agriculture department announced after the close of trading 
on tuesday that it was offering china 2 million tons of subsidized 
wheat 
this along with expectations that the soviet union will bid on a 
half million tons of wheat this week combined to create a sense of 
optimism in the wheat pit said victor lespinasse a trader with 
dean witter reynolds inc

under late selling pressure 
on the close wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents higher with the

i am not aware of any particular details he said 
the review body was formed at the tucs annual convention last 
september to review several areas it is considering among other 
things whether unions should be required to ballot their members 
before agreeing to such deals the times of london reported 
the body which has been holding a series of meetings is 
expected to announce its recommendations in a report issued before 
the next convention in september at which tuc delegates would vote 
on them 
britains unions have been bitterly divided over whether to 
accept these deals which have become more common in recent years 
particularly at plants owned by japanese companies 
the unions have disagreed on how best to fight the loss of their 
power under the conservative government of prime minister margaret 
thatcher which has introduced unioncurbing legislation that for 
example requires unions to ballot their members before calling a 
strike 
the deals are strongly opposed by ron todd head of the 
transport and general workers union britains largest union 
eric hammond general secretary of the electricians union known 
as the eetpu has threatened several times to ballot his 336000 
members on pulling out of the tuc 
hammond has the support of bill jordan president of the 
amalgamated engineering union who also has warned that he would 
try to bring his 857000strong union out of the tuc if he were 
prevented from signing more of the controversial deals 
the aeu is the countrys secondlargest union

us trade representative clayton yeutter told 
the governments of britain france west germany and spain on 
wednesday they are risking a trade war by their enormous 
subsidies to airbus passenger planes 
the major trade bill now before congress would permit the 
charging of extra countervailing duties on imports of the 
airbus they would be designed to compensate for the subsidies 
raising the price of the foreign planes and thus improving the 
chances of us aircraft manufacturers making sales to airlines 
here 
the longer these governments delay in coming to grips with 
their own subsidies for airbus the more they heighten the risk of 
a major trade conflict yeutter said in a statement 
with the statement yeutters office distributed a detailed 
refutation of a report on march 18 by airbus industrie the 
consortium that makes the planes on us subsidies to aircraft 
manufacturers he criticized the report as containing poor 
scholarship and false conclusions 
it said the us government had provided about 23 billion in 
direct and indirect subsidies over the past decade to boeing co 
and mcdonnell douglas corp 
us trade officials have long complained that the european 
subsidies give european aircraft builders an unfair advantage over 
us companies 
the us does not directly support civil aircraft programs 
yeutter said it is the four european governments that have 
lavished gigantic sums on airbus for nearly two decades despite the 
programs inability to show any profit 
he said he expects to see members of the european governments in 
paris in midmay and would like to discuss indirect subsidies 
before then 
we will not hold such discussions on the basis of a study 
that has no credibility he said 
after the last negotiations at constance west germany on march 
18 yeutter said a first step had been taken in a prospective 
agreement on production subsidies but that there was still a long 
way to go on subsidies for research and development 
the statement issued by yeutters office said the us 
government buys goods for its own needs and not to benefit any 
manufacturer when major contractors make profits they can spend 
them as they will it added 
by contrast the airbus partners must spend the money supplied 
to them by their governments on commercial airplane development and 
nothing else the statement said

the stock market rolled up one of its biggest 
gains of the year today taking its cue from a stronger dollar and 
a decline in interest rates 
the market took off in the early afternoon after trading in a 
narrow range earlier in the day 
analysts said the gain was due to a strengthening of the dollar 
in foreign exchange trading which in turn prompted a decline in 
interest rates 
the dollar moved higher they said on speculation that the 
major industrial nations may be moving toward a reaffirmation of 
support for the currency against the japanese yen a meeting is 
planned for next week 
such an agreement could mean that the federal reserve would no 
longer feel it necessary to tighten its credit policy and push 
interest rates higher in a bid to head off inflation

gainers outpaced losers by nearly 3 to 1 on the new york stock 
exchange big board volume totaled 18976 million shares compared 
with 13529 million on tuesday

voluntary restriction on computerized program trading on the new 
york stock exchange for the first time since the limit was 
announced feb 4 
program trading a technique used by brokerages to profit on 
price differences between stocks and the corresponding stockindex 
futures has been blamed for injecting volatility into the market 
and frightening investors 
the market climbed steadily throughout the afternoon after 
trading in a narrow range earlier in the day 
analysts said the gain was due to a strengthening of the dollar 
in foreign exchange trading which in turn prompted a decline in 
interest rates in the credit markets

major industrial nations may be moving toward a fresh agreement to

a news report out of japan quoting anonymous sources said 
finance ministers and central bankers of the group of seven

traders gave credence to the rumor of the dollaryen target when 
they saw evidence that the federal reserve was buying treasury 
securities for a customer which they guessed might be the bank of 
japan said arthur liming an analyst at lns financial group in 
chicago 
the dollar has also been helped somewhat by a high federal funds 
rate the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans the 
higher rate makes dollardenominated securities more attractive 
liming said the dollar eased off from its highs of the day when 
traders observed that the federal reserve was injecting reserves 
into the financial system something that would tend to restrain 
interest rates 
dealers said the dollar was also boosted when a feared japanese 
selloff of dollars at the beginning of the new quarter failed to 
materialize 
but they said trading was likely to remain limited before next 
weeks meeting in washington of officials of the group of seven

moore mccormack resources inc said wednesday it 
has agreed to be acquired by southdown inc for 512 million in 
cash after resisting repeated overtures from the houstonbased 
cement company 
moore mccormacks board recommended shareholders relinquish 
their shares to southdowns existing 40ashare tender offer the 
offer expires at midnight edt wednesday but southdown said it 
would accept moore mccormack shares for payment following the 
expiration of that deadline 
under terms of a definitive merger agreement southdown also 
will acquire moore mccormacks convertible issues and debt the 
companies have agreed to dismiss all pending litigation between 
them 
in new york stock exchange trading moore mccormack fell 75 
cents to close at 3975 a share southdown rose 50 cents to 4075 
a share 
southdown also said it would terminate a previous agreement to 
sell moore mccormacks oil and gas subsidiary called moore 
mccormack engery to castex international corp for 125 million in 
cash 
a southdown spokeswoman had no comment on whether moore 
mccormack management would be asked to stay on board 
moore mccormack a stamford connbased cement and energy 
concern had said it was negotiating with other unidentified 
parties about the acquisition of the entire company the moore 
mccormack board met tuesday to weigh bids for the company 
including southdowns as well as a recapitalization plan the 
board had engineered as a defensive measure 
southdowns latest offer for moore mccormacks 128 million 
outstanding shares represents the fourth time the company has 
sweetened its bid 
southdown approached moore mccormack on feb 23 with an initial 
31ashare tender offer which valued the company at 391 million 
that bid as well as a sweetened 35ashare offer that followed 
were rejected as inadequate 
the board of directors of moore mccormack continues to believe 
that remaining independent would be a superior alternative over the 
longrange term the company had said in a statement following 
the two offers 
moore mccormack responded to the two bids by unveiling a 400 
million recapitalization plan that would have paid shareholders a 
hefty dividend and authorized the sale of certain assets the 
company had even lined up loans to finance the payout and related 
costs 
a day after the recapitalization plan was unveiled southdown 
responded with an offer that would have paid shareholders 35 in 
cash plus debt securities valued at 5 for each share they held 
the bid was amended to a straight 40ashare in cash last week 
moore mccormack posted a profit of 216 million on revenue of 
3578 million in 1987 the company makes cement concrete products 
and aggregates primarily in the southeastern united states and is 
engaged in oil and gas exploration and production mainly in texas 
and louisiana

precious metals futures retreated sharply wednesday triggered 
by the surging value of the dollar 
on other markets wheat and cattle futures moved higher other 
grains and beans were mostly a little weaker and stock index 
futures posted substantial gains following a rally on the stock 
market 
there were strong movements on most of the financial markets 
the story that seemed to light the fire under all these 
markets was a japanese news account that major financial 
ministers would reaffirm the lower the lower limit of the dollar 
at about 125 yen said craig sloane an analyst in new york with 
smith barney harris upham amp co 
there have been unconfirmed reports that the finance ministers 
from the five major industrial nations will meet next week in 
washington this supposedly would be in conjunction with scheduled 
meetings of the international monetary fund and the world bank 
the japanese wire service nikkei reported wednesday that the 
group of 5 nations will affirm the dollaryen rate 
this was just a report said sloane and we dont have 
any idea if theres any truth to it but with the yen at 125 this 
morning the dollar went higher he said 
this pushed the precious metals to the brink he said 
with silver especially putting in a very poor performance 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold settled 440 to 
570 lower with june at 45130 a troy ounce and silver was 22 
cents to 225 cents lower with may at 6465 a troy ounce 
stockindex futures at the chicago mercantile exchange recorded 
one of the busiest days since the october stock crash estimated 
volume of the standard amp poors 500 index was an estimated 62286 
compared with a monthly average in march of about 48000 
a surge in the dow jones industrial average triggered a curb at 
the new york stock exchange on program trading under which traders 
buy or sell stocks and take the opposite action in index futures 
this came late in the session however and apparently didnt have 
a large impact on trading at the merc 
the june sampp 500 contract settled 790 points higher at 26740 
the underlying index was up 698 points at 26549 
cattle futures advanced on followthrough buying from tuesdays 
late recovery at the chicago mercantile exchange but the 
underlying factors dont look good said charlie richardson an 
analyst with lindwaldock amp co 
feedlots are selling a little cheaper for the first time in 
two or three weeks he said adding that the boxed beef trade is 
declining 
salesmen are saying theyre having trouble moving beef at the 
retail counter and theyre disappointed with the performance at 
easter said richardson 
live cattle futures settled 12 cent to 48 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in april at 7402 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 02 cent to 40 cent higher with april at 7957 cents a 
pound live hogs were 30 cent lower to 28 cent higher with april 
at 4570 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 25 cent lower 
to 02 cent higher with may at 5322 cents a pound 
wheat futures advanced while the other grains and soybeans were 
mostly lower on the chicago board of trade 
wheat continued the gains posted during a sharp runup on 
tuesday and overnight news gave the market fresh incentive 
the agriculture department announced after the close of trading 
on tuesday that it is offering china 2 million tons of subsidized 
wheat 
this along with expectations that the soviet union will bid on a 
half million tons of wheat this week combined to create a sense of 
optimism in the wheat pit said victor lespinasse a trader with 
dean witter reynolds inc 
wheat settled 1 cents to 3 cents higher with the may contract 
at 309 a bushel corn was 1 cents lower to cent higher with 
may at 207 a bushel oats were 1 cent lower to cent higher 
with may at 165 a bushel and soybeans were 3 cents to 4 cents 
lower with may at 667 a bushel 
energy futures were little changed on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 3 cents 
higher with the april contract at 1630 a barrel heating oil was 
02 cent lower to 18 cent higher with may at 4534 cents a gallon 
and unleaded gasoline was 07 cent lower to 22 cent lower with may

representatives of chrysler corp 
workers voted wednesday to seek the job protections and economic 
benefits won by the united auto workers union in contracts signed 
last fall with general motors corp and ford motor co 
weve had a pattern settlement before us now for almost a 
year it should not take a long time for us to put this 
together uaw president owen bieber told reporters after 
addressing the 140member uaw national chrysler council 
chrysler and the uaw agreed to open talks early april 18 
instead of midjuly after chryslers attempt to sell its 
28000worker acustar inc subsidiary sparked bitter worker 
opposition 
chrysler backed down from the sale in early march shortly after 
the issue erupted but decided the damage left in its wake would 
intensify if the two sides waited until july to meet at the 
bargaining table 
bieber said he didnt believe the rift would hurt the chance of 
an early settlement mirroring the industrypattern gm and ford 
contracts 
i dont plan on sitting in early negotiations with chrysler 
from the time we open here in april until sept 14 when 
chryslers contract expires bieber said adding that bargainers 
will set a target settlement deadline after talks begin 
bieber also said negotiators would try to save four acustar 
plants that chrysler said it will close or sell 
the chrysler contract covers 59000 active and 8000 laidoff 
workers at 49 local unions the uaw wants a twoyear contract with 
chrysler instead of the usual threeyear pact so that its contracts 
with all big three automakers will expire together in 1990 
uaw vice president marc stepp said the council will vote 
thursday on other demands and on a potentially divisive issue 
whether nearly 1000 former american motors corp workers at an 
engine and stamping plant in kenosha wis should be included 
under the chrysler contract 
some local union leaders said they oppose the idea because if 
the kenosha engine plant closes those workers would have the right 
to take jobs that otherwise could go to laidoff chrysler workers 
chrysler already has said it will close a 5500worker assembly 
plant in kenosha by years end and those workers will be covered 
under a separate closing agreement all the kenosha workers belong 
to the uaw but currently work under contracts negotiated with amc 
not chrysler 
stepp said the union traditionally has included operations 
purchased by an automaker under that companys national contract 
other union officials who asked not to be identified called 
the opposition selfish and argued that the kenosha workers already 
are part of chrysler which bought amc last year 
proposals approved wednesday would like the pattern gm and ford 
contracts forbid plant closings not announced before the start of 
negotiations the unions proposals for chrysler also would ban 
sale of plants or other operations according to the printed 
resolutions approved by the council 
the ford and gm agreements also forbid layoffs for any reason 
except slow sales of a product the exception seen as a loophole 
by many workers has allowed gm to indefinitely close plants that 
make products whose sales were lagging 
but bieber said any loophole would most likely be addressed in 
1990 talks rather than at the chrysler table this year 
under the pattern workers also will receive bonuses equal to 3 
percent of their 1988 and 1989 earnings and a share of 
salesgenerated profits if their companies earn above a set amount 
the uaw also wants to increase its representation on chryslers 
board of directors already unique in the auto industry from one 
seat to four the current seat belongs to the uaw president and 
bieber said it gives him an extra chance to try influencing some 
corporate decisions that affect his members 
with three other uaw members on the board bieber joked it 
wouldnt be a 191 vote anymore im convinced i could convince my 
uaw colleagues to vote with me

gd searle amp co said wednesday it will expand a 
program of giving heart disease drugs to the poor a move observers 
say puts the company at the helm of the pharmaceutical industrys 
efforts to help the indigent 
under a yearold pilot program skokiebased searle gave 9 
million worth of high blood pressure medicine to 20000 patients 
the company said it would expand its patient in need program by 
making all seven of its heart medicines available 
the plan will roughly double the cost and the number of patients 
involved company officials said 
to kick off its expanded program searle planned on wednesday to 
deliver 1 million worth of certificates for drugs to clinics and 
hospitals in 10 major cities 
i personally believe that all drugs that treat 
lifethreatening diseases should be involved said dr sheldon g 
gilgore searles chairman and chief executive officer he noted 
that congressional sources put the number of americans without any 
health insurance at 37 million 
judee shuler a spokeswoman for the pharmaceutical manufacturers 
association said all drug manufacturers do something to help poor 
patients but searle is more extensive 
most of searles drugs are cardiovascular medications and 
gilgore called on other pharmaceutical houses to follow suit with 
their drugs 
this area is extremely tricky said thomas nefi a spokesman 
for er squibb amp sons inc of princeton nj drugs are a 
commodity rigorously controled by the federal government its not 
like making shoes and giving them to the poor 
nefi said he was not familiar with the details of searles 
program but he noted that the distribution mechanism is going to 
be difficult and i would like to see how theyre going to do it 
searles expanded effort will distribute the drugs in the same 
manner as the pilot program said spokesman william i greener 
participating doctors are issued certificates from searle 
patients receive both a prescription and a certificate both of 
which must be presented to a pharmacist 
patients get the drugs for free while pharmacists mail the 
certificates to searle for reimbursement 
the company classifies poor people as those with annual 
household incomes of 8000 for one or two people or 11000 for 
three or more family members to qualify patients must not have 
insurance or other assistance that would pay for the drug 
several other drug makers have some form of indigent care 
program 
merck sharp amp dohme a division of merck amp co donates drugs to 
various charitable groups such as the catholic medical mission 
board which distributes them to physicians who pass them on to the 
needy at home and abroad 
merck also will give free drugs to individual doctors who 
request them for poor patients said spkeswoman nancy gellert 
we feel we give a pretty broadly based coverage she said 
roxane laboratories in columbus ohio gives a drug to poor 
terminal cancer patients in severe pain said company spokesman 
gerald c wojta the company announced its plan several years ago 
wyeth laboratories a division of american home products corp 
has a compassionate program for the tryly needy through the 
physician said spokeswoman audrey ashby its judged on a

spurred by the increased interest shown by 
petroleum companies in the chesapeake bay the senate approved a 
measure wednesday that would forbid drilling for oil and gas in the 
bay and its tidal tributaries 
the measure drafted by a legislative workgroup now goes to 
gov william donald schaefer who has endorsed the ban as a 
necessary element in the multistate effort to protect the bays 
environment 
the upper house also approved two other bills that would give 
the state a greater role in regulating oil and gas exploration and 
production elsewhere in the state 
while there is currently no drilling in the bay the 
environmental community became alarmed late last year by reports 
that texaco inc and exxon corp would fund additional seismic 
testing in the bay to locate possible oil or gas deposits 
during an earlier hearing on the bill delegate brian frosh 
dmontgomery chief sponsor of all three bills likened oil 
drilling in the bay to playing russian roulette 
a single spill could set back all of our bay cleanup efforts 
many years insisted frosh the chesapeake bay is far too 
important to our heritage and our future to put at risk in this 
fashion 
at the same hearing oil industry representatives said they have 
a good environmental record in offshore drilling and urged 
lawmakers not to thwart the search for new petroleum sources 
this country and this state cannot wait until the next 
international oil crisis arises argued michael mcdonald 
director of the maryland petroleum council 
the schaefer administration also has given tentative backing to 
the other two measures approved in the senate wednesday both bills 
will be returned to the house for further consideration 
under hb296 the chesapeake bay critical areas commission would 
be given the power to deny any application for drilling rights in 
socalled critical areas surrounding the bay 
hb296 would require the state board of public works to adopt 
regulations to govern oil drilling leases in maryland the bill 
also would hold drilling companies liable for any environmental 
damage caused by their activities

a federal judge said wednesday that britains 
brian beazer cannot proceed with his 17 billion hostile tender 
offer for koppers co until at least april 15 
a us district judge in los angeles on monday suspended the 
60ashare offer indefinitely on antitrust grounds us district 
judge maurice cohill in pittsburgh said if beazer succeeds in 
overturning the california ruling his order immediately blocks the 
offer until he rules on koppers arguments that the unwanted 
suitors violated securities law 
cohill said he will rule by april 15 on the pittsburgh 
construction materials and chemicals companys request for a 
preliminary injunction 
it was not immediately clear how this latest barrier would 
affect the tender offer from bns inc the takeover company formed 
by beazer and shearson lehman hutton inc attorneys for the beazer 
interests said a delay could scuttle its tender offer 
meanwhile koppers chairman charles r pullin said wednesday he 
expects beazers tender offer will be declared inadequate by 
koppers board of directors 
my judgment is that with more time we will find that the bid 
is inadequate pullin testified in federal court one day after 
koppers board said it was reserving judgment on the offer 
under questioning by bns attorney edwin mishkin pullin said he 
also expected someone to beat the 60ashare offer 
im not sure i could hazard a guess as to when a better 
offer might come pullin said 
the chairman said he expected some stockholders would consider 
60 a share as an adequate offer he said he also expected some 
shareholders would want to accept the 60 a share arbitrageurs 
likely would tender their stock as well he said 
the offer from beazer head of the construction and building 
materials concern beazer plc and shearson lehman hutton was to 
have expired at midnight thursday the two are partners in bns 
along with the national westminster bank plc which launched the 
tender offer march 3 
pullin told cohill on wednesday that the board is considering 
selling an interest in all or part of the company koppers prefers 
to sell no more than 20 percent to 25 percent of its valued 
construction materials and services group he said 
koppers has said it also is considering a recapitalization plan 
and if necessary the sale of the entire company as a defensive 
measure charles barber a koppers director noted in testimony 
tuesday that a recapitalization plan is still in the formative 
stages 
a managementled buyout of koppers chemicals businesses also 
has been considered an alternative to the bns offer 
some management people have talked about a leveraged buyout 
which would keep the company here in pittsburgh pullin 
testified during a hearing to consider koppers request for an 
injunction 
so far however a leveraged buyout of the companys chemical 
operations hasnt been actively pursued partly because of the 
costs involved he added 
pullin said the koppers board met tuesday with its financial 
advisers who gave ambiguous opinions on beazers valuation of the 
company 
dillon read amp co engaged to advise nonmanagement directors 
was unable to say the 60ashare offer was adequate but first 
boston corp which is advising all the directors was unable to 
say the offer was inadequate pullin said 
koppers closed on the new york stock exchange on wednesday at 
5537 a share down 87 cents 
the us 9th circuit court of appeals on tuesday denied an 
emergency motion to overturn the lower court but the appeals court 
will take the appeal during the coming week cohill said

fortified by a stronger dollar lower interest 
rates and an afternoon of frenzied buying the stock market soared 
wednesday as the dow jones industrial average posted its second 
biggest gain of the year 
but despite the strong gain some analysts were skeptical about 
how long it could last 
it was a very impressive rally but its still a manic 
depressive market so im not trusting it yet for any sustained 
move said thomas czech head of the investment policy group at 
the brokerage blunt ellis amp loewi in milwaukee 
the dow jones industrials the markets bestknown indicator 
advanced 6416 points to close at 206167 it was the ninth 
biggest gain ever in the dow jones industrials and the largest gain 
since it climbed 7642 on jan 4 
the dows gain was so powerful that it triggered a 50point 
voluntary restriction on computerized program trading on the new 
york stock exchange for the first time since the limit was 
announced feb 4 
but even after the restriction was triggered stock prices 
continued to rise until the market closed 
gainers swamped losers by a margin of nearly 3 to 1 in the 
overall tally of nyselisted issues with 1187 up 414 down and 
384 unchanged the nyse index rose 347 to 14976 
volume on the big board came to 18976 million shares up from 
13529 million shares on tuesday 
the stock market opened with some modest gains but gave most of 
them back by noontime before sweeping broadly ahead in the early 
afternoon 
analysts said the trigger for the markets rise was a news 
report from japan that said officials of the seven major industrial 
countries are likely to agree on a plan of support for the dollar 
a strong dollar would diminish inflationary pressure and 
perhaps ease the pressure on the federal reserve to tighten its 
credit policy said newton d zinder who follows stocks for the 
investment firm shearson lehman hutton 
expectations that the fed would tighten its policy and raise 
interest rates had been depressing stock market psychology he said 
larry wachtel a market watcher for prudentialbache securities 
inc said the dollars strength soon rippled through the bond 
market sending longterm rates lower that in turn made yields on 
stocks look more attractive he said 
in each of the markets he said traders who had sold borrowed 
contracts in expectations that the dollar bonds and stocks would 
fall suddenly saw prices rising and felt compelled to buy in an 
effort to cut their potential losses 
too many people were selling the market short he said 
the voluntary restrictions on program trading were called into 
play after the dow jones average passed the 50point gain mark at 
about 319 pm edt a spokeswoman for the exchange said 
program trading a technique used by brokerages to profit on 
price differences between stocks and the corresponding stockindex 
futures has been blamed for injecting volatility into the market 
and frightening investors

millionaire industrialist victor posner said 
wednesday he does not want a judge to set aside his setence for tax 
evasion that grants five years probation on the condition he set 
up a 3 million program for the homeless 
posner responded to a motion filed monday by a federal 
prosecutor challenging the legality of that sentence us attorney 
leon kellner said the court could not force a defendant to make a 
contribution to a nonaggrieved person 
at a hearing wednesday us district judge eugene p spellman 
required the 69yearold posner to state under oath that he did not 
wish the sentence set aside and that he was going ahead with the 
plan freely and voluntarily 
spellman said posners chief attorney edward bennett williams 
must formally reply to kellners motion within 30 days 
meanwhile spellman heard posner and a 10member blueribbon 
committee discuss the programs first stage a study of 
homelessness in three southern florida counties 
since february i have been studying and learning about the 
problems of the homeless both nationally and in florida posner 
said in a brief statement part of his sentence has included work 
at camillus house a refuge for the homeless in miami where posner 
served food attended substance abuse meetings and gave out 
clothing 
posner said the study which is being administered by barry 
university will examine groups such as alcoholics the mentally 
ill and families with children and will review how government 
policies affect homelessness findings of the study are scheduled 
to be available by midmay 
but he stressed that the study is not the most important element 
of the program 
all the studies in the world will not help one homeless 
person posner added i will come to you with what will solve 
the problem 
spellman said he didnt plan to take an active role in the 
committees work but he suggested the initial study not use more 
than 250000 to 500000 of posners donation 
posner said he was ready to deposit the necessary money in any 
institution directed by the court 
the sentence also ordered posner to pay about 4 million in back 
taxes penalties interest and fines for pleading nocontest to 10 
counts of tax fraud for inflating the value of land donated to 
miami christian college 
spellman acknowledged when he imposed the sentence that its 
legality might be questioned 
if for some reason the sentence is ever challenged this 
court will in fact incarcerate victor posner he said in 
february posner could be sentenced to up to 40 years in prison for 
the offenses

mgmua communications inc said wednesday 
that more suitors have come forward since the filmmaking company 
announced monday it was considering several unsolicited takeover 
bids 
separately the company reported it had reduced its losses by 73 
percent for the second quarter and 84 percent for the half partly 
because of its successful film moonstruck 
disclosure of the new bids came as the company announced a 
special committee of its board has been formed to weigh the offers 
the committee does not include financier kirk kerkorian who owns 
79 percent of the companys 501 million shares 
the committee will promptly consider the inquiries received 
before mondays announcement as well as additional inquiries 
received in the last two days said mgmuas chairman and chief 
executive lee rich 
the company again declined to identify the suitors or to 
indicate whether it would be amenable to a takeover saying only 
we have a duty to our shareholders to explore these matters 
analysts have suggested kerkorian may be offering to buy the 
rest of the stock and take the company private other likely 
investors listed by analysts were investors marvin davis and burt 
sugarman whose separate bids for other companies are stalled and 
considered unlikely to succeed 
kerkorian had been majority owner of the old metrogoldwynmayer 
and united artists studios then sold them in 1986 to media 
entrepreneur ted turner for 15 billion plus assumption of some 
debt as part of that deal kerkorian immediately repurchased the 
ua segment 
later turner sold off all of the mgm unit except for its film 
library that he is using on his atlantabased superstation wtbs 
kerkorkian purchased the studio and lorimartelepictures corp 
bought some other assets 
kerkorian paid a total of 730 million to buy back the two 
segments and has had spotty success in his attempts to rebuild the 
companies 
for its second quarter ended feb 29 the comapny posted a net 
loss of 46 million compared with a deficit of 171 million a 
year earlier revenue for the period rose 48 percent to 1579 
million from 1062 million 
for the half the company trimmed its losses to 26 million 
from 144 million as revenue rose 43 percent to 3399 million 
from 2372 million
