new england power officials warned on sunday night 
that blackouts may occur throughout the sixstate region monday 
unless businesses and homeowners conserve electricity amid the heat 
wave 
a shutdown this weekend of the maine yankee nuclear power plant 
and one of four power generators on salem harbor in massachusetts 
has worsened the already difficult power situation for most of new 
england officials said 
the national weather service reported that 18 cities in the 
northeastern quarter of the nation reported record high 
temperatures for the date sunday and forecast that new england 
would have 90s with 80s in the northern portions on monday 
boston had an ironic record low temperature of 78 late sunday 
afternoon when an ocean breeze cooled the area but as soon as the 
winds shifted the temperature shot up 14 degrees in 10 minutes 
the weather service said 
monday is definitely a very tight day said bill sheperdson 
a spokesman for the new england power pool which coordinates power 
supplies for utilities throughout new england 
if we dont get a considerable contribution by our customers 
as we did a number of days last week we may not be able to provide 
uninterrupted service sheperdson said 
boston edison spokesman michael monahan called the situation 
tremendously tight and said the numbers simply dont add up for 
power supply to continue without periodic controlled blackouts 
monday 
the new england region controlled by the new england power pool 
set a record for summertime power demand last thursday at 19608 
megawatts the pool is expecting demand to exceed 19900 megawatts 
monday 
thats 300 megawatts more plus youre missing maine yankee 
which is 860 megawatts monahan said 
maine yankee shut down over the weekend because of a transformer 
problem according to monahan the pool is predicting the plant 
will be out of service until wednesday at the earliest 
in new york city meanwhile consolidated edison reported a 
record for sunday electricity demand 7645 megawatts between 9 
pm and 10 pm breaking the record of 6770 megawatts set last 
sunday spokesman marty gitten said peak demand often occurs at 
that hour as people return home from weekend activities and turn on 
air conditioners and lights

in the heart of this roman catholic city 
one of the latest bits of wall graffiti says abortion now but 
someone has blackened the telephone number 
the graffiti in st stephens green is emblematic of an ongoing 
clash but not over legalizing abortion thats already banned in 
the irish republic 
the struggle is over a womans right to receive information on 
obtaining a legal abortion elsewhere 
this country with its 95 percent catholic population enshrined 
an abortion ban into its constitution in 1983 approved by a 21 
margin in a national referendum the amendment says a fetus and 
mother have an equal right to life which must be defended by the 
state 
three months ago the supreme court ruling on action brought by 
the countrys main antiabortion group declared that the amendment 
made it illegal for pregnancy counseling centers to provide women 
with any information to help them get a legal abortion 
however university students across the republic have vowed to 
continue publishing the names and telephone numbers of clinics in 
england where abortion is legal 
access to information is a civil liberty and prevention of 
such access is a form of censorship which we should not tolerate 
said tadhg daly president of the 120000member union of students 
in ireland 
the society for the protection of the unborn child the 
plaintiff in the supreme court ruling had sued two pregnancy 
counseling centers for telling women how to get abortions in 
england 
now it has now targeted university college dublin with 10000 
students the countrys largest university 
on july 1 the antiabortion societys lawyers wrote to four 
student leaders threatening legal acton unless they removed the 
addresses of english abortion clinics from a manual given to 
students at the start of each academic year 
the schools student union president diarmuid coogan replied 
that students had voted to include the abortion information and 
said it will remain in the manual 
all options should be available to women without pressure to 
opt for one or the other said coogan 
does the society for the protection of the unborn child intend 
to put us in jail for implementing the democratically decided 
mandate of our students coogan asked 
all 40 colleges in the country back coogan and four including 
dublins prestigious trinity college say they will publish the 
same abortion information this fall 
the national students body has promised legal assistance to 
fight attempts to stop publication 
maire vernon spokeswoman for the society for the protection of 
the unborn child said the group will wait to see if the 
information is in this years student manuals before deciding on 
legal action 
the right to life is written into the constitution and it 
overrides the right to information mrs vernon said the right 
to life is paramount you dont have an untrammeled right to 
information especially if it is going to take the life of a 
child 
coogan retorted that the society wants to make abortion not 
exist 
but thousands of irish women go over to britain every year for 
abortions he said if women are going to have abortions they 
should have that information 
according to british government figures 3673 women living in 
the irish republic received abortions in britain in 1987 down from 
3918 in 1986 mrs vernon said this was the lowest number since 
1983 the year of the referendum 
that means a lot of girls arent even considering abortion but 
are going ahead and having the baby mrs vernon said 
hopefully it will continue to drop but britain is only 60 miles 
off our coast and well have to keep working away 
pauline ryder clinic administrator of the dublin well woman 
center said the drop more likely stems in part from fewer irish 
women giving irish addresses when they have british abortions 
because of the controversy 
the well woman clinic is one of two centers barred by the 
supreme court from providing information on how to get abortions 
after the suits by the antiabortion society 
the other center closed and ms ryder said well woman might be 
forced to do the same because it has been ordered to pay the 
antiabortion societys 60000 legal costs 
while launching a fundraising campaign the center last month 
resumed pregnancy counseling limiting its discussion of abortion 
to the operation methods care and cost but not giving the 
addresses of the english clinics 
the center plans to appeal the supreme court ruling to the 
european court of human rights by sept 16 on grounds it violates 
the right to seek receive and impart information and ideas 
through any media which is guaranteed in the universal 
declaration of human rights 
however its not clear a european court ruling in favor of the 
center would change national policy 
although legalizing abortion is not an issue a survey released 
last month by the economic and social research institute found 58 
percent of the population favored abortion if pregnancy seriously 
endangers a womans life or health or results from rape or incest

last temptation of christ passed with little trouble and more 
moviegoers than protesters

united states and canada has been denounced by protestant 
evangelists and conservative catholics 
protesters contend that the portrayal of jesus in the fictional 
movie as a man with selfdoubt and a temptation to give up his call 
as a savior to live as a mortal is blasphemous 
security guards and police were searching purses and guarding 
movie screens there were reports of minor vandalism at the century 
plaza cinemas in the los angeles and one arrest each in 
washington dc and new york city 
police in los angeles said demonstrators have kept themselves

very casual eye on it 
police officers had patrolled friday in the theater complex 
which showed the film to near capacity crowds on two of its screens

crowds friday night as about 300 people demonstrated outside the 
theater

around the block as 75 demonstrators marched in a circle jeering at 
those buying tickets officials reported that one person was

film as about 300 demonstrators held a peaceful prayer vigil 
outside

a usair baggage handler who found 10000 in a 
bag at greater pittsburgh international airport may end up with the 
loot if the owner isnt found police say 
at least four people staked a claim for the cash which was 
found aug 5 they have been unable to convince police they are the 
rightful owner 
theyve been people who honestly believed the money could be 
theirs said allegheny county police sgt diane pilkington but 
they were grasping at straws 
the claimants reported either losing large sums of money or 
having cash stolen recently 
police ask those who try to claim the money to describe the 
bills in terms of denominations and if possible serial numbers 
they also ask them to pinpoint where the cash was lost and how it 
was packaged 
it was unclear when police would call off their search for the 
owner of the money

not very long ago this resort spas 
illegal gambling was hotter than its muchtouted healing spring 
water so much so that local government winked and even reaped tax 
revenue rather than stop it 
throngs of tourists and townspeople took chances in violation 
of state law on at least 350 slot machines card games bingo and 
bookmaking 
police looked the other way except to collect the municipal 
amusement tax until 1967 when a state crackdown during the 
administration of the late gov winthrop rockefeller scrapped tons 
of betting devices 
it was probably the only illegal tax in this country collected 
by a city recalls state sen eugene bud canada who was 
garland county sheriff in 1967 but wasnt invited to join state 
agents who raided the casinos 
they built a city auditorium where the miss arkansas pageant 
is held a beautiful place and a city hall and the main 
firehouse downtown all on an illegal tax he says 
dusty tax records show the city levied 10 monthly for each slot 
machine 
the baxter hotel butlers barbecue harlem chicken shack and 
the eatmore cafe had one slot each more adventurous were the jd 
jackson fish market vfw club and hot springs country club with 
two slots apiece 
the best bet at coys steak house these days might be the 
forktender prime cuts but in 1967 diners waiting for a table 
could play eight slot machines 
tax rates ran 100 a month for bingo and cards 500 for large 
casinos those with more than five gaming tables and 300 for 
small casinos the casinos included places like the ohio club 
southern club and the vapors 
tax rates were raised in 1964 but the elks club refused to pay 
the difference records show club officials sent payments on their 
five slots at the old rate until the state raids in early fall 1967 
the cornerstone of public morality is respect for the law 
rockefeller declared that year in hiring former fbi agent lynn a 
davis to be state police chief 
davis says he told rockefeller he wanted to concentrate on law 
enforcement not politics and specifically on closing casinos he 
says rockefeller slapped his knee and said thats exactly what i 
want 
early on aug 17 1967 davis and about two dozen officers 
converged on the downtown bridge street club 
it was after normal business hours and the door was locked the 
owner was summoned according to newspaper accounts when he didnt 
show after an hour davis broke a glass panel in the door with a 
tire iron in front of photographers and troopers knocked in the 
door 
two days later the arkansas gazette editorialized davis has 
given the state the most convincing demonstration yet of how the 
state can break the back of the notorious hot springs gambling 
operation which has been a scandal of historic but nonetheless 
disgraceful dimension he was following his responsibility to 
the law where local enforcement had defaulted 
canada cried foul im really incensed the sheriff told 
reporters he complained about the lack of notice to local lawmen 
especially those who have to be elected and must answer to the 
people 
davis responded 21 years later the bridge street club the 
ohio club and all of the other clubs could be found by tourists who 
went to hot springs they could have been found by a blind man and 
if the sheriff didnt know they were there then i was afraid to 
take him with me on a raid 
canada attributes the friction to politics 
you had a brandnew republican governor and you had a 
brandnew democratic sheriff he says 
proposals to legalize casino gambling fell twice to voter 
rejection in 1964 and in 1984 and once to rockefellers veto in 
1967

us officials are frustrated by persistent 
reports some blamed on soviet disinformation that latin 
american children are being butchered for organ transplants in the 
united states 
the reports have been crisscrossing the globe for the past 20 
months confounding us officials who have been trying to locate 
their genesis track their progress and provide credible denials 
the latest report surfaced last week in paraguay after police 
raided a house and found seven infants and several pregnant women 
who apparently planned to give their babies up for adoption 
a juvenile judge angel campos said that while he had no proof 
he believed some of the babies might be dismembered in the united 
states for their organs which could then be sold for hundreds of 
dollars 
the story circulated by a respected news agency has been 
making the rounds of the world press this week despite adamant 
denials from the us embassy in asuncion 
the us information agency has concluded that all the reports 
are based on unsubstantiated rumors which began in honduras its 
yearlong investigation aided by the fbi the department of health 
and human services and other agencies has failed to find any 
proof of the charges 
the original misinformation would not have spread so far and 
wide if it had not been for the way it was cynically used and 
embellished with deliberate distortions in a disinformation 
campaign by several communist countries with the soviet union and 
cuba taking the lead according to a report on soviet 
disinformation prepared by usia for congress 
the united network for organ sharing which oversees organ 
transplants in the united states has also denied the charges 
its very frustrating when you dont know whos spreading such 
rumors said kelle straw a spokeswoman for the nonprofit 
organization which receives some of its funds from the government 
ms straw said the united network had never found any leads to 
follow in its own investigation of the reports 
and anyway its ridiculous she said children dont make 
good donors their organs arent fully developed 
in its report to congress the us information agency cited 
dozens of other such reports which have surfaced in places as 
diverse as bangladesh and morocco some in communist party 
newspapers and others in independent publications 
the rumor is gruesome enough so that it would feed on itself 
without any help said todd leventhal an agency official who 
prepared the report and has been monitoring the baby parts case 
as it is known in the government 
but because the soviets are involved were seeing more of 
these reports and with more of an antiamerican slant he added 
latin america where thousands of babies are adopted by 
foreigners every year is a fertile ground for breeding such rumors 
in its report to congress the usia concluded it is sometimes 
hard to tell which of the baby parts allegations are due to 
misinformation and which is due to disinformation 
but leventhal said disinformation experts in the united states 
can tell whether the soviets are behind a certain report according 
to the newspapers carrying such a story and the slant that it takes 
in some cases the soviet role is quite obvious he said 
on july 25 1987 the official soviet newspaper izvestia 
reported that an international mafia brings up disabled children in 
guatemala and sends them to the united states there the butcher 
medics cut out their hearts kidneys and eyes the izvestia 
report said 
the newspaper cited officials of the genevabased defense for 
children international as the source of its information the 
organization accused izvestia of turning out a veritable 
masterpiece an astute mix of quotes taken out of context 
journalistic comment established fact and unfounded allegations 
the course of the baby parts story constitutes a fascinating 
study in the life of a rumor 
the usia has traced the original report to leonardo villeda 
bermudez formerly honduras top social welfare official bermudez 
was quoted as saying in january 1987 that he was told by some 
social workers several years previously about people seeking to 
adopt disabled children so they could sell them for parts in 
the united states 
his comments were circulated worldwide by a respected news 
agency lending them sufficient credibility and exposure so that 
they have been cited repeatedly since then despite his retraction 
the day after his remarks were reported 
in his retraction bermudez said he confused a simple rumor 
with facts other honduran officials denied there was any proof of 
such practices 
but more than a year later his comments were still circulating 
and were quoted among other places in the venezuelan newspaper 
el nacional 
it just wont die just when we think weve managed to get rid 
of it it pops up again said leventhal

from tiny vials of elvis presleys 
sweat to plans to bury hank williams in the toe of a huge cowboy 
boot some southerners aint been whittling dixies icons from 
slabs of good taste a trained observer says 
the greater the fame of the heroes the more apt you are to find 
tacky items and stories twisting up around their memory like 
tendrils of the kudzu vine said charles wilson a professor of 
history and southern studies at the university of mississippi 
wilson a native texan has become a selfappointed keeper of 
what he calls the southern tacky collection 
many people would say his campus office is cluttered with junk 
but he views it as a display of material artifacts dating to 
1950 
this is sort of the wall of southern culture all sorts of 
posters with post cards pictures images of the south post cards 
often portray these icons of the south wilson said motioning to 
hundreds of cards papering his office wall and sitting in stacks on 
his desk 
this one is my alltime favorite it has a small vial of 
elvis sweat the king lives his perspiration will be your 
inspiration it says 
heres presleys cadillac this is a real icon theres all 
kinds of stories about presley driving around in his cadillac he 
gave cadillacs as gifts 
though prized nothing in wilsons collection is priceless 
rather they are generally cheap 
these are not necessarily things that stand out for uniqueness 
but things that are representative he said they are such 
simple items theyre not the kind of things anybody saves 
every region has its massproduced tacky items but wilson 
contends some pieces are uniquely southern 
a lot of the things i collect are symbols he said a 
cotton bale for example in mississippi if you go to stuckeys or 
various stores they sell little cotton bales as souvenirs as a 
symbol of the south thats marketing a symbol of the south 
other miscellaneous tacky stuff in the collection ranges from 
popup cardboard antebellum homes to a stuffed armadillo and 
plastic cows that moo when their heads are twisted 
a big category in his collection is fans primarily stamped with 
images of a happy family or pastoral theme wilson said funeral 
homes most often produced and gave away the fans which were used 
extensively before airconditioning 
another favorite item is an inexpensive clock with wooden 
extensions on the sides photographs apparently torn from 
magazines of martin luther king jr and his wife coretta and 
president john kennedy and sen robert kennedy are glued on each 
side 
it looks almost like an icon in a catholic church in europe or 
something with wooden panels and then the saints wilson said 
his collection also includes advertisements and wrappers from 
southern sweets like goo goo clusters and moon pies 
another facet of his work examines southern yard art like 
plastic pink flamingos exactly when and how it developed im 
still trying to find out but you dont find this in places other 
than the south he said 
wilson also collects tacky tales of the modern south 
his favorite is a proposal by some members of the montgomery 
ala city council shortly after the death of country singer hank 
williams in 1953 to construct a monument to him in the shape of a 
cowboy boot 
it was going to be a huge towering monument with his body 
buried in the toe part wilson chuckled it was a pretty wild 
idea all right the city council in montgomery actually debated 
it 
the idea eventually was tossed out

george bush is playing the vice president 
gambit for everything its worth which isnt very much but then 
its the only bit of show business available this week at the 
republican national convention 
his orchestrated surprise will be good theater for a few hours 
in new orleans and obviously the republican presidential 
nominees choice of a running mate is a crucial decision in the gop 
bid to keep the white house 
but nobody is going to remember the theatrics once they are done 
the bush plan is to announce the selection on thursday morning 
with tight secrecy until then campaign manager lee atwater said 
therell be as much drama as we can have the better to boost 
interest and television ratings 
im for doing anything that will help build up a tv 
audience atwater said 
there wont be any leaks of this one because im not gonna 
tell a soul said bush 
some souls may think there are clues however take gov james 
r thompson of illinois who telephoned bush on friday and asked 
not be considered for second spot on the ticket 
such requests often come from people who figure they arent 
going to be chosen anyhow 
having been there bush knows the way the game is played for 
bush there was a hotel suite across the street from the detroit 
convention hall in which president reagan was nominated in 1980 
bush a defeated rival for the republican nomination that year 
waited out a very long night of speculation that former president 
gerald r ford would be the vice presidential nominee on the reagan 
ticket it was going on midnight when that deal fell apart and 
reagan turned to bush a quick telephone call a quick acceptance 
a joint appearance before the convention to quell the chaos and 
introduce the running mate 
now it is bushs turn to issue the summons his presidential 
nomination is set the vice presidency is the only unfilled role 
actually what he is doing is choosing his candidate the 
oldfashioned way until relatively recent conventions 
presidential nominees observed strict vows of silence on the vice 
presidency until after their own nominations advance discussion 
was presumptuous gauche 
on wednesday night of convention week after the roll call that 
delivered the nomination the presidential nominee would summon his 
high command into latenight session to settle on no 2 prospects 
would come and go from the candidates suite 
in 1964 president lyndon b johnson chose sen hubert h 
humphrey for his ticket but summoned connecticut sen thomas j 
dodd too just to keep people guessing 
latterday candidates have taken to listing prospects in advance 
and in some cases to conducting preconvention job interviews 
they send out questionnaires they look at fitness reports 
that practice took on some urgency after the 1972 democratic 
convention at which nominee george mcgovern chose sen thomas 
eagleton to run with him and learned after the fact that eagleton 
had been hospitalized for nervous exhaustion and fatigue and had 
undergone electric shock treatments 
r sargent shriver replaced him on the ticket which went down 
in flames and presidential nominees have tended to conduct more 
thorough advance checks on prospective running mates ever since 
in 1976 jimmy carter interviewed seven prospects then chose 
walter f mondale for vice president when his turn came mondale 
conducted a similar set of preconvention auditions and chose rep 
geraldine ferraro 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis interviewed a 
halfdozen prospects then chose texas sen lloyd bentsen a week 
before the national convention that nominated that ticket in 
atlanta 
in the bush selection game a dozen names have floated into 
speculation encouraged by campaign stage managers 
two governors thompson of illinois and gov george deukmejian 
of california said they do not want to be considered as did sens 
nancy kassebaum of kansas and william armstrong of colorado i 
would be a liability protests sen al simpson of wyoming 
thompson cited family concerns he said hed have to travel too 
much and his wife couldnt come because they have a 10yearold in 
school 
at face value that would make him the first politician to 
shrink from seeking national office for want of a sitter 
if they wont run others will rep jack kemp of new york said 
hed be glad to accept sen dan quayle of indiana said it would be 
an honor sen pete domenici said he wasnt too proud to campaign a 
little for it howard baker says he doesnt want the job but it 
would be arrogant to turn it down 
mark them down for honest men the fact of the matter is that 
there arent many republican politicians who would say no if asked

a leading newspaper on sunday criticized 
officials for banning superman and at least four chinese films 
that passed the censors and opened to packed movie houses 
in a rare plea from the official press the china youth news 
called for measures to prevent such lawlessness 
the report said superman was one of at least five movies 
banned in the capital since 1985 it said unidentified officials 
decided the films were unfit for the masses 
the officials had showings of superman halted in early 1986 
because they said the movie turned the world upside down and 
reversed the flow of time according to the report 
the officials did not want chinas youth to be inculcated with 
the films impossible idealism the report said 
in the 1978 movie superman rescues lois lane from death in an 
earthquake by circling the earth at the speed of light and 
reversing time 
two of the other films that were banned in beijing the fierce 
battle in taierzhuang and the beach have won awards in china 
the controversial taierzhuang depicts a battle between the 
kuomintang archrival to the communist party and japanese invaders 
in 1938 
in the movie the kuomintang who were forced out of china in 
1949 and now occupy taiwan are depicted as patriotic and even 
heroic an image which clashes sharply with the one created by the 
communist government 
the report said that in april 1987 when taierzhuang was 
playing across the nation officials closed the film in beijing 
after eight months of agitation in the movie industry the report 
said the government let the film show in beijing but only for six 
months and no advertising was allowed 
at the end of 1985 the report said the beach a explicit 
love story was suddenly pulled from beijing movie theaters even 
after official censors approved it the paper said certain 
leaders thought the plot would have a bad affect on society 
in the film a woman is forced by her family into an arranged 
marriage the scene of her wedding night portrays the tribulations 
of an unwilling bride in bed with her husband 
the paper said that in many cases the officials banning the 
films had no relation to the ministry of culture which is 
responsible for censorship it did not say what department of 
government the officials were from 
the report also said that since 1984 beijing has only allowed 
two copies each of popular martial arts movies to circulate in the 
capitals movie theaters while other cities had 10 copies 
this regulation might be a good one in order to limit the 
influence these movies have one young people the paper said 
but because theres no law to follow who knows whether its 
true 
the report said banning movies after they have already been 
released has cost beijings theaters thousands of dollars it also 
said officials who like unpopular movies have forced city film 
officials to order more copies of them causing further losses 
the report called for a law that would set clear regulations on 
the content of movies to counteract official capriciousness 
a recent issue of outlook magazine said officials at the 
ministry of culture are studying a proposed law setting censorship 
guidelines for movies 
among the topics being debated the magazine said is whether 
naked bodies or serious crimes should be depicted on chinas silver 
screen 
the proposal would mark the first time since communist china was 
established in 1949 that explicit standards have been set about 
what can and cannot be included in a chinese movie

rep kenneth j gray a frizzyhaired 
bowtied magician who is retiring after 24 years in congress wants 
to be remembered as the prince of pork who brought billions in 
federal projects to his depressed district 
but hes still trying to live down a reputation as the man who 
brought elizabeth ray to washington 
its a bum rap gray says of allegations that he had a 
personal relationship with miss ray the icanttype secretary 
who claimed she was on a committee payroll only to provide sex for 
the chairman thenrep wayne hays dohio 
i hired her in 1972 fired her in 73 and she didnt even meet 
wayne hays until 1976 said gray an illinois democrat i never 
had anything to do with elizabeth ray personally im no angel and 
dont profess to be people can say lots of things about me and 
they do but thats one thing i was not guilty of 
gray 63 is guilty of wearing loud clothes driving big cars 
and delivering by his own estimate about 7 billion worth of 
federal projects to his coalmining district in southern illinois 
ive always been called the prince of pork and i wear that 
label proudly gray said it means we got 500 miles of 
interstate highway modern concrete roads water and sewer and 
lights all things we needed in southern illinois we tried to 
build the infrastructure needed for local communities to pull 
themselves up by their bootstraps 
citing poor health he announced last november that he will 
retire at year end after 12 terms that spanned 34 years 
it was one of the most difficult decisions ive ever made 
he said to walk away from this kind of power which gives you 
the vehicle to help other people is a tremendously regretful 
situation 
gray has served on the public works committee during his tenure 
and wields considerable clout through his seniority and friendship 
with the democratic leadership particularly with house speaker jim 
wright 
wright who often assigns gray to preside over the house 
cautions against judging gray by his flamboyant dress and jocular 
nature 
the more you know him wright says the more convinced you 
become of his having a firstrate mind a sincere purpose and the 
capacity to perform effectively 
gray said his retirement plans are sketchy at the moment ive 
got a motor home and i want to putter around the united states and 
see a lot of places i havent been he said but who knows i 
may get tired of it and want to get back into government 
one thing is definite i intend to become very active in 
feeding children and hungry people 
a coal miners son and amateur magician who spent his early 
years as a car dealer airport operator and auctioneer gray became 
known for showmanship and his downhome style when he arrived in 
washington 
he often used magic tricks to illustrate his speeches which he 
peppered with such folksy phrases as when i meet somebody i 
shake their hand twice and times are so bad down in southern 
illinois that the creeks are only running three days a week 
gray also developed an image that haunts him today a reputation 
for flashy clothes fancy cars and latenight parties 
velvet suits have given way to doublebreasted sport coats and 
bow ties and gray describes his lifestyle as quiet today an 
impression shared by friends 
it could be said we all mellow with age said house minority 
leader robert michel a republican from peoria ill he is a 
different person although ken was always a very popular figure 
even during his early days 
id like to be remembered for helping people with all those 
things gray said but ill be happy if they just remember me

republicans are carefully orchestrating their 
convention to emphasize a different message each day for george 
bush and insisting that their gathering will be issueoriented and 
not a series of oneliners like you heard in atlanta 
bush himself says he cant guarantee that no one will take a 
swipe at democratic rival michael dukakis adding i cant 
control everybody however the vice president and his staff say 
the advice to convention speakers is to stay positive and focus on 
the issues 
each night of the fourday convention opening monday will be 
devoted to broad themes such as the successes of the reaganbush 
years the issues and ideas of bush and the differences between 
bush and dukakis 
president reagan will kick off the process with a primetime 
address monday night the president will lay out the record of 
the last seven years and theres not a better man in america to do 
that than ronald reagan said campaign manager lee atwater 
the second night you will see a lot of comparative speeches 
you will see comparative differences on quite a few vital issues 
atwater said among others new hampshire gov john sununu will 
attempt to debunk what dukakis calls the massachusetts miracle 
of economic recovery while former presidential hopeful pat 
robertson will talk about values 
the third and fourth nights will be devoted to two things no 
1 pointing out george bushs qualifications pointing out what he 
has done with his life and why he is the best qualified man to be 
president and lastly of course thursday night he will be front 
and center talking about where he wants to take country and what he 
believes in this will really be his first time in front of the 
american people front and center stage like this atwater said 
bushs staff says there will be a clear distinction between the 
republican convention and last months democratic convention in 
atlanta 
alixe glen a bush campaign spokeswoman said it will be very 
issuespecific bush has said many times this is not going to be 
negative 
its not going to be a series of oneliners like you heard in 
atlanta she said referring to taunts that bush was born with 
a silver foot in his mouth and was a toothache of a man 
referring to the democratic convention she said i think it 
was a little bit offensive to people watching it on television 
people want to be informed on issues its not like tuning in 
comedian joan rivers 
to underscore the daily message republican leaders will hold 
news conferences each day each news conference will feature two 
speakers a political person such as atwater and an issues expert 
prepared to deal in depth with a particular subject 
to further cement the message the campaign has assembled 10 
caucus teams that over the course of the week will visit each of 
the 54 delegations each caucus team will include a member of 
bushs family a cabinet member a campaign official an elected 
official and a celebrity of some fashion 
ms glen described the overall operation as one that was 
blanketing the city theyre all hearing the same three 
messages of the reaganbush record the issues of bush and his 
differences with dukakis

eduardo castellouvogel whipped up the troops 
one more time 
were party animals right he yelled 
right the 50 greeters lined up at gate 15d in the new 
orleans airport screamed back 
what did you say 
right they yelled even louder 
delta flight 4082 from san francisco had not even finished 
rolling up to the gate when castellouvogel started his charges 
clapping 
play some music he shouted to the onward brass band 
lets boogie 
the plangent sounds reached the passengers even before they made 
their way up the ramp and caught sight of the cheering clapping 
signwaving throng decked out in red white and blue to greet them 
the exuberant cheers grew even louder for those who arrived in 
this reknowned party town sporting republican paraphernalia like 
the woman who deplaned from nashville with two stuffed elephants 
grazing atop her straw hat 
its all part of our effort to let people know new orleans is 
a friendly city and that we want them here said todd 
villarrubia assistant director of airport operations for the 
republican national convention 
volunteer greeters 700 of them were trained to give a rousing 
welcome to the delegates politicians vips and assorted gop 
conventioneers arriving at new orleans 
the greeters began patrolling the two airport concourses aug 5 
and will keep rolling out the red carpet through aug 20 
from 8 am to 11 pm they cheer clap call out greetings and 
blow kisses at those arriving although theyre there to greet 
those attending the republican national convention everyone on the 
plane gets the same welcome 
it was wonderful said mary setar of los angeles whose 
husband came to play in a convention orchestra i didnt know 
what to think i looked around thinking someone famous must be 
arriving but they were doing it for all of us i think its 
marvelous just the kind of thing you expect from new orleans 
jonathan price a delegate from monterey calif agreed 
its absolutely wonderful you come off the plane after a long 
trip and sometihing like this really pumps you up 
for the greeters seeing the reaction of the people arriving is 
just part of the fun 
its kind of like a surprise birthday party said amie 
johnson 13 as she prepared to meet another plane im hoping to 
see someone famous before we finish but i greet everyone the same 
way even if theyre not a celebrity 
in fact the greeters said saturday spotting the real 
celebrities arriving for the convention is tough 
we saw maria shriver today she had on big sunglasses but my 
friend recognised her fran moorman said 
jane ray is convinced that one television anchorman slipped past 
incognito 
dan rather wore a disguise when he came through the greeter 
said i talked to some people who saw him they said he had on a 
false moustache dark glasses and a baseball cap

james burnetts chairmanship of the national 
transportation safety board ended saturday night because the senate 
hasnt acted on his renomination according to burnett 
he was nominated for a fourth term as chairman by president 
reagan on april 19 and his current term as a member of the ntsb 
doesnt expire until late 1990 
my term as chairman however expires at midnight tonight 
which has happened two times before burnett said saturday in new 
orleans where he was to attend the republican national convention 
i hope to be reconfirmed he said i slept very well 
the two previous times lack of senate action on his nomination 
meant burnett lost his chairmanship to the boards vicechairman 
the senate commerce committee has not scheduled a hearing on his 
renomination 
the chairman of the committee sen wendell ford dky is 
not in burnetts corner and hes not alone jim fleming fords 
administrative assistant said in july 
the senate is in recess until after labor day and burnett has 
said his nomination is bogged down because of democratic hopes to 
replace him if michael dukakis wins the presidential election 
im still hoping to be confirmed but you never can take 
senate confirmation for granted burnett said its always 
prolonged and its designed to provide for careful scrutiny 
i dont presume to predict how the senate will proceed he 
said 
one mistake that a nominee subject to nomination cannot make 
is to presume the results of the senates deliberations to say im 
sure im going to be all ill say is i hope to be reconfirmed i 
dont take the senate for granted

barbara bush is loyal to a fault but she says 
she wont turn into a glamorous princess just because her 
husband in running for president 
what you see with me is what you get im not running for 
president george bush is says the snowyhaired wife of the 
certain republican nominee 
mrs bush says she is eager to get out on the campaign trail for 
the man she absolutely adores and that she intends to tell 
voters about his strength courage and ability to get things done 
but her loyalty to her husband of 43 years has its price 
calling herself the worlds worst secret keeper mrs bush 
said she has asked her husband not tell her about his choice for a 
running mate ive kept secrets but its agony she said 
this time i want to be surprised 
at ease with reporters and lauded by many for her kindnesses 
to them staffers on the bush campaign refer to mrs bush as their 
secret weapon 
but her quick wit and eagerness to chat got her into trouble 
four years ago when she was quoted by reporters as saying of 
geraldine ferraro the 1984 democratic vice presidential nominee 
that 4 million i cant say it but it rhymes with rich 
it was dumb of me i shouldnt have said it mrs bush says 
now insisting she holds no grudge against the reporters i blame 
barbara bush it was not attractive and ive been very shamed i 
apologized to mrs ferraro and i would apologize again 
but unable to resist another quip she adds im not making 
poems anymore 
mrs bush admits feeling a bit envious of kitty dukakis the 
wife of democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
shes so attractive the vice presidents wife confides 
dropping her voice to a nearconspiratorial whisper id love to 
look like her if you want to know the truth 
at 63 mrs bush is a year younger than her husband george and 
two years younger than the perfectly coiffed and designerdressed 
nancy reagan 
but there will be no apologies here thank you very much for 
the creamy complexion adorned with multiple laugh lines or the 
curved figure thats more at home in silky afternoon dresses or 
wellworn jeans than state dinner decolletage 
im not going to turn into a glamorous princess she says of 
her campaign role 
well aware of the criticism heaped on mrs reagan for her 
highpriced tastes mrs bush says theres more to the race than 
hair styles or designer frocks 
im not going to worry about it i have plenty of 
selfconfidence not in how i look but in how i feel and i feel 
good about my husband my children and my life she said 
that security has been gleaned during a life begun in what many 
would consider affluence as the daughter of the publisher of 
mccalls magazine but it has been tested during the years by the 
ups and downs of her husbands career and such personal loss as 
the death of a daughter to leukemia 
mrs bush exudes serenity as she bush and their five children 
enter the formal campaign to replace the reagans at 1600 
pennsylvania ave 
it could well be their 29th residence 
since the 19yearold sophomore from smith college married the 
tall and lanky navy flier on jan 6 1945 in her hometown of rye 
ny theyve moved more than two dozen times virginia 
connecticut texas washington dc new york city and china have 
been called home all during bushs odyssey from military man to 
yale graduate to oil man to politician 
although her speech is marked by the wellmannered tones of the 
blueblood background she shares with husband she can be imperious 
when he is criticized 
asked about the wimp image thats plagued her husband she 
sniffs thats just what the democrats say 
and when queried about the fact that polls indicate that fewer 
women prefer her husband to dukakis she retorts 
im slightly offended as a woman when i hear george has this 
enormous gender gap she said she puts the onus on the party 
not her man 
i think the republicans have a gender gap not george bush 
she says 
over the coming months shell campaign about 60 percent of the 
time on her own the rest with her husband talking about the 
things she knows best george bush and her yearslong fight to 
battle illiteracy 
she contends her husband is perfectly willing to let others 
take the credit for things hes done george bush is a fellow who 
believes in quiet leadership you dont have to blow you own 
horn mrs bush said 
thats probably why our relationship is so good he lets me 
think i think all the good things up

john zaccaro jr is spending his fourmonth 
prison term for selling cocaine in a 1500amonth luxury 
apartment in vermont with maid service cable tv and privileges at 
the ymca next door 
the son of former vice presidential candidate geraldine ferraro 
is staying in one of 12 units in a building designed for 
expenseaccount business people on short assignments in burlington 
vt 
we like to think of it as a cross between an apartment and a 
hotel with the advantages of both a spokeswoman for the 
buildings owners said according to a story in sundays editions 
of the new york daily news 
addison county states attorney john quinn who prosecuted 
zaccaro took a dimmer view this guy is a drug felon and hes 
living in conditions that 999 percent of the people of vermont 
couldnt afford 
zaccaro 24 was convicted in april of selling a quartergram of 
cocaine to an undercover police officer while a student at 
middlebury college in 1986 judge francis mccaffrey sentenced him 
to onetofive years in prison with all but four months suspended 
zaccaro was determined eligible for the state corrections 
departments house arrest program under which nonviolent 
convicts can find their own housing and live under what is said to 
be close supervision by corrections officials 
the department doesnt provide the apartment said john 
perry director of planning for corrections the prisoner does 
that we are only concerned that it meets minimum standards no 
drugs no guns no college kids hanging around 
obviously some people mr zaccaro among them have more money 
than others and they can afford a better place the aga khan 
probably wouldnt think much of his apartment its a matter of 
standards of living and we are not paying for it so we cant 
decide a place is too luxurious if it meets the other criteria 
corrections officials did say there was concern however that 
dissatisfaction in the law enforcement community with the 
comfortable way in which zaccaro is serving time may threaten the 
future of the house arrest program 
its a disgrace to put a drug dealer into the program quinn 
said im not happy about it and neither are other states 
attorneys

many delegates to the republican national 
convention believe the gender gap is a fallacy despite recent 
polls showing george bush lagging in efforts to win over women 
voters 
thirtyseven percent of the 1215 delegates surveyed by the 
associated press said the gender gap the voting patterns of women 
compared to men is not a problem for the certain gop nominee 
some delegates believe the republican party does have a problem 
with women voters but doubt it will have a big impact on the 
general election others dismiss the gender gap as a figment of the 
medias imagination 
i think he should stay just where he is said marylin 
shannon a delegate from salem ore i think the gender gap is a 
creation of the media reagan had a gender gap and he carried 49 
of 50 states in the 1984 election 
i dont think it has anything to do with george bush it has 
to do with democrats vs republicans said raymond shamie of 
walpole mass the state gop chairman if women understood they 
would realize the republican party is genuinely compassionate 
that was also true prior to reagans general election and it 
evened out said rep don ritter of allentown pa 
this gender gap is idiotic said charlotte mousel of tustin 
calif only the media thinks there is one 
of the delegates surveyed 452 said changes by bush to attract 
women voters were unnecessary including 144 delegates who 
described the gender gap as no problem 
the latest nbc newswall street journal poll conducted aug 58 
and released thursday showed democratic nominee michael dukakis 
holding a 5331 lead over bush among women voters 
women have been supporters of bush from the early days because 
george bush is handsome cordial and honest said marjorie arsht 
of bellaire texas i dont know who these women could be unless 
they belong to some very extremist groups 
however 25 percent of the delegates surveyed 301 of the 1215 
said the vice president should stress where he stands on issues 
of concern to women including federal day care programs equal 
rights and pay abortion and education to counter the gender gap 
a total of 2277 delegates will attend the republican national 
convention next week 
he should come forward more on womens issues said dennis 
delaney of charlotte vt reagan is perceived to be weak on 
womens issues bush will pay the price for that 
he has to express his sensitivity to problems facing women 
such as single parenthood lack of child support said mary ellen 
miller of owasso okla he must present some ideas of his own on 
how to eliminate some of these problems 
some delegates believe that if bush explains his stand the 
gender gap will disappear 
when women find out about his programs there will be a 
different attitude said ken beckerich of oregon city ore 
hes a strong advocate for women in the work force once you see 
the real george bush come out youll see the opinion polls change 
fast 
thirteen percent or 160 of the delegates surveyed believe bush 
should appoint women to highranking posts in his campaign and 
cabinet 
ten percent of the delegates polled 122 suggested a female 
vicepresidential candidate frequently mentioning former 
transportation secretary elizabeth dole and former united nations 
ambassador jeane kirkpatrick 
other delegates believe the vice president needs to work on the 
image he projects 
i think he should go to womens groups and show his twinkling 
blue eyes said marguerite armstrong of south burlington vt 
just become a better actor i think that impresses them 
said dwight friedrich of centralia ill 
i think he needs a stronger stance said steve lilly of 
nacogdoches texas hes not a cowboy or a machoman type which i 
think the females prefer 
barbara mckernan a delegate from bangor maine and mother of 
gov john r mckernan suggested bush kiss more babies 
ten delegates said it was important for bushs wife barbara to 
get out on the campaign trail 
shes his biggest asset as far as women are concerned said 
bev hammerstrom of temperance minn 
but william maio jr a delegate from itasca ill was 
hardpressed to advise bush 
i havent the vaguest idea what makes the woman voters mind 
tick he said

the only surviving movement of beethovens 10th 
symphony which he was writing while on his deathbed in 1827 will 
be played in public for the first time at a concert in london on 
oct 18 
the sunday times said the movement has been painstakingly and 
brilliantly reconstructed from fragments of beethovens original 
manuscripts by dr barry cooper a lecturer in music at aberdeen 
university in scotland 
the royal liverpool philharmonic orchestra conducted by walter 
weller will perform the symphonys first movement at royal 
festival hall a spokeswoman said 
beethoven had promised the 10th symphony to london audiences 
eight days before his death and had assured a london friend that 
sketches of the new work were already in my desk the sunday 
times said 
but the paper said posthumous researchers failed to find any 
retrievable music among beethovens possessions biographers 
disregarded an account by his secretary karl holz who said the 
composer sat at the piano and played him the opening of the 10th 
symphony 
five years ago the sunday times said cooper was doing research 
in a west berlin library and found a set of sketches that matched 
holzs reminiscences of the opening movement coopers belief that 
these were from the missing 10th symphony was reinforced by the 
discovery of additional sketches in the beethoven archive in bonn 
the paper said 
by combining the two sets cooper was quoted as saying i 
began to find what beethoven had in mind for the first movement i 
tried to keep very close to the sketches to reconstruct the 
movement as beethoven envisaged it at that time 
i had to fill in some harmonies and compose myself a few 
linking sections but i did not invent any new themes those are all 
beethovens he was quoted as saying 
the sunday times said none of beethovens scraps of notes 
contained more than 20 bars just a few seconds of music but the 
paper said that by laying the scraps end to end cooper assembled 
an entire movement lasting almost 14 minutes 
while beethovens ninth symphony shocked contemporary 
listeners with its unprecedented choral finale the sunday times 
said that the first movement of the 10th symphony threatens to 
dissolve the traditional barriers between movements inventing a 
more fluid structure for the symphony

its not part of brent justensens job to 
knock on neighborhood doors asking about jewelry nor is he paid to 
visit jewelers to find out the worth of a diamond ring 
but justensen 24 who works for the central davis sewer 
district did both last month after finding a gold ring graced with 
18 diamonds 
i thought it was fake at first he said then i saw the 
14k on the band and i thought i better find out for sure 
justensen found the ring after he and other workers did a 
routine cleaning of a section of sewer line that serves angel 
street in kaysville 
i saw the band stuck into the grit so i pulled it out and we 
cleaned it off he said 
the ring was found on a friday and over the weekend justensen 
had it appraised by two jewelers who estimated its worth at 800 to 
1200 
i had to sit down i was so shocked he said i just 
figured if id lost something like that id be excited to have it 
back 
the next monday he returned to angel street and finally ended 
up on ann hills doorstep 
right on the spot when asked from out of the blue i couldnt 
think about it she said 
but then she said it dawned on me i wear a pendant just 
like it and i showed it to him it was from a set my husband gave 
me years ago 
it was just like a dream hill said you know i had 
gotten to the point where i didnt expect to see it again and i 
had kind of grieved over that ring 
hill said it wasnt just the discovery that stunned her but 
justensens honesty in this age you just dont see that many 
examples of it she said its a wonderful thing to know we 
have people like this in the world

twine and a lot of patience

down to the river at 530 am each day set the trap with corn and 
run a piece of twine from the trapdoor to his car 
hed sit there until 645 am waiting for donald to waddle 
into the trap it never happened until saturday

attorney general richard l thornburgh 
expressed little enthusiasm sunday for edwin meeses lastminute 
order to have independent counsels investigate wrongdoing in 
congress and said he saw only a very limited role for such 
special prosecutors 
meeses final act friday as attorney general was to sign an 
order for special prosecutors to investigate criminal allegations 
against members of congress democratic lawmakers called it the 
vindictive act of a man who had himself been investigated by two 
such prosecutors 
meese said he had discussed the order with thornburgh and added 
i believe he agrees with it 
but thornburgh questioned on cbstvs face the nation 
declined to say whether he would go along with the order 
i havent had an opportunity to review the order he said 
from boston adding i think there should be a very limited role 
for socalled special prosecutors or independent counsels 
thornburgh a former pennsylvania governor headed the justice 
departments criminal division during the ford administration in 
the mid1970s and established the public integrity section that 
prosecutes corrupt public officials 
he said the public integrity office has done a firstclass 
job in tracking down official corruption federal state or 
local wherever it may be 
obviously the attorney general who preceded me had some 
reason for enunciating this order and i want to take a look at that 
and give it due consideration but the fact of the matter is that 
if the evidence is there investigations and prosecutions will be 
undertaken against anyone who violates the federal criminal laws 
be they congressmen or ordinary citizens thornburgh said 
the new attorney general said he was aware of conflicting 
reports about the state of morale and commitment within the 
department an apparent reference to the furor caused by the 
resignation of top officials during the waning days of meeses 
tenure 
thornburgh said he had not discussed with vice president george 
bush whether he would stay on if bush is elected president

battle last weekend 14 of them police officers and nearly 100 
charges of police brutality were filed

handful of demonstrators turned rowdy several hours after 
saturdays demonstrations and rallies staged to protest the 
earlier alleged police violence

inciting to riot resisting arrest and disorderly conduct police 
said 
four men were charged with attempted burglary after they tried 
to break through the polished glass and brass front doors of an 
expensive condominium building on one side of the park 
the building a target in last weeks demonstrations has come 
to symbolize gentrification and unwanted change for many protesters 
who feel they are being forced out of the neighborhood an ethnic 
melting pot for generations of immigrants by high rents and 
realestate speculators 
after the music ended late saturday about 150 chanting 
protesters accompanied by 90 police officers marched across the 
east village to washington square park

as george bush approaches the high noon of his 
quest for the republican presidential nomination he is striving to 
move out of the shadow cast by president reagan while seeking to 
capitalize on reagans enormous popularity 
reagans shadow has already shortened for bush these days he is 
seldom dogged with questions about distancing himself from the 
president instead the questions now center on whether his 
candidacy is exerting too much influence over the reagan white 
house 
both bush and reagan in recent days have fended off suggestions 
that some presidential decisions have been motivated by an effort 
to help the bush campaign 
and confronted with public opinion polls showing bush far behind 
among democrats who voted for reagan bush advisers have now 
switched strategy to make sure that the reagan shadow doesnt 
disappear altogether 
after first planning no contact at the republican national 
convention between reagan and his vice president a joint rally is 
now scheduled for tuesday in new orleans 
it follows an upbeat joint appearance between reagan and bush at 
a rally last friday for senior administration officials at the old 
executive office building during which reagan lavished praise on 
his vice president 
if all goes as planned bushs transformation into his own man 
will be complete when he accepts the republican presidential 
nomination thursday night at the republican national convention 
according to aides and gop consultants 
by the end of the convention all the emphasis is going to be 
on george bush and his vice presidential nominee said his chief 
of staff craig fuller 
lee atwater bushs campaign manager said that bush has made 
a conscious decision for seven years to be secondary to the 
president 
and now that hes running for the president himself hes 
talking about how he feels what he believes in and where he wants 
to take the country atwater said 
to be sure there are some areas in which bush does not want to 
put much light between himself and reagan largely the current 
economic expansion now in a peacetime record of 69 months and the 
fact that most of the world is at peace 
the vice president has been inching away from his close 
identification with administration policies since he and aides 
huddled for a week in late may at his vacation home in 
kennebunkport maine the consensus from his advisers was 
nearunanimous he had to do more to establish his own agenda 
since then bush has hinted that he would be more aggressive in 
dealing with the soviets would enforce civilrights laws more 
vigorously would spend more on education and do more to clean up 
the environment than the president he has served for the past 7 
years 
he has also proposed many of his own initiatives including a 
22 billion child care program a ban on offshore ocean dumping 
and a reorganizaton of the antidrug effort under the office of 
vice president he also has proposed a new white house ethics 
office and a flexible freeze on federal spending 
but most of bushs moves away from the administration have been 
cautious for fear of appearing disloyal 
im not going to change just to emerge from a shadow he has 
said 
in a recent interview bush said he will differ with reagan when 
he feels he has a different set of goals 
i have every intention of saying here is what weve done and 
and here are my priorities 
but im not doing that to quote distance myself to show my 
own identity he continued im doing it to say look here is 
what weve done here are the successes and here are the 
shortcomings and heres what george bush will do 
still bushs close identification with the administration 
continues to pose problems for him as democrats keep driving home 
their where is george slogan 
when the general election campaign heats up after labor day 
bush is expected to be hit repeatedly by democrats for his role 
still vague in some of the less popular reagan administration 
decisions including armsforhostages dealings with iran and past 
support for panamanian dictator manuel noriega 
meanwhile the impact of bushs candidacy has already been seen 
in a number of recent presidential decisions including reagans 
selection last week of a hispanic lauro f cavazos to be 
education secretary fulfilling in advance a bush campaign pledge 
reagan filled two other cabinet vacancies with people on close 
terms with bush naming former pennsylvania gov richard thornburgh 
to succeed edwin meese as attorney general and wall street 
investment banker nicholas f brady to follow james a baker iii as 
treasury secretary baker resigned to run bushs campaign 
the president also yielded to bushs urgings in deciding to 
allow a plantclosing notification bill to become law and in the 
presidents veto of a 2995 billion defense authorization bill 
reagan also has picked up on some of bushs campaign themes 
including advocating the death penalty for drug kingpins 
i dont think its as much a matter of bush disagreeing or 
separating himself from reagan as much as demonstrating that his 
agenda is a little different said gop consultant charlie black 
who is a bush convention adviser 
and john sears another republican consultant said the real 
moment of truth is when bush accepts the nomination 
he can campaign on the virtues of what eight years of the 
reagan administration have brought to the country and he can prove 
himself presidential in his acceptance speech he can do it all 
sears said

edward bennett williams a fiercely 
competitive criminal lawyer who won fame representing figures of 
power in the nations courtrooms and as a harddriving sports 
entrepreneur outside them is dead at 68 
a funeral mass will be held tuesday at st matthews cathedral 
here for williams whose 11year battle against cancer ended with 
his death saturday at georgetown university hospital 
williams a former owner of the washington redskins football 
team and at his death the owner of the baltimore orioles baseball 
team made his reputation in the law defending the powerful in 
their times of greatest need 
his clients included former cia director richard helms sen 
joseph r mccarthy labor leader jimmy hoffa former texas gov 
john b connally and underworld boss frank costello 
a former national treasurer of the democratic party williams 
had a personal relationship with every president from john f 
kennedy to ronald reagan 
president gerald ford asked him to be director of central 
intelligence in 1975 and reagan offered him the same job last year 
williams declined both times citing his preference for 
independence the first time and failing health on the second 
occasion 
president richard nixon was an intense adversary during the 
watergate scandal when williams represented the democratic national 
committee in a suit against nixons reelection campaign committee 
nixon in remarks later revealed by disclosure of the white 
house tapes had vowed to fix williams the celebrated lawyer 
privately called nixon snake brains but years later the two 
men became amicable after williams wrote to nixon 
sports heroes political figures and fellow baseball team owners 
paid tribute to williams on his death 
he was one of the most remarkable men ive every known said 
bud selig owner of the milwaukee brewers team he had a spirit 
the rest of the world could take a lesson from 
the brewers playing host to williams orioles on sunday 
observed a moment of silence at milwaukee county stadium and 
lowered flags to half mast 
joseph califano a former cabinet official of president jimmy 
carter and onetime law partner with williams said he was the 
best everything he was the best father the best husband the best 
lawyer the best partner the best friend and he was 
extraordinarily brave 
former oriole star brooks robinson a hall of fame third baseman 
and now announcer for the team credited williams with keeping the 
orioles in baltimore rather than moving it to the nearby nations 
capital 
he made a monumental effort as far as keeping the team 
there robinson said he was good for baltimore baseball 
williams succumbed to cancer after seven operations but his 
friends and associates said that almost to the end the disease did 
not deter him from hard work 
i try to be guided by the ethics i was taught by the 
jesuits williams once said a trial is like a war 
the son of a department store floorwalker williams was born may 
31 1920 in hartford conn and decided early in his life to 
become a lawyer 
he graduated with highest honors in 1941 from holy cross college 
and enrolled at georgetown university law school after his 
discharge from the army air force because of back injuries 
williams survived the crash of a bomber during a training exercise 
an accident in which everyone else on board died 
williams set up his own law firm in 1949 and his first bigname 
client was sen mccarthy whose name became synonymous with 
communist baiting 
williams acknowledging that he represented unsavory characters 
never shunned the role 
the more opprobrium that was attached to the client the more 
i relished the case he said 
williams left the redskins after coowner jack kent cooke 
acquired controlling interest of the team and bought out williams 
share williams by that time already had purchased the orioles 
williams tenure with the team was controversial and mixed with 
success and failure the orioles won a world series in 1983 but now 
are at the bottom of the american league as williams acquisition 
of highpriced stars generally failed to pan out 
he is survived his wife agnes anne neill a former lawyer in 
his law firm three children by his first wife and four children 
by his second marriage

sunday after ceremonies marking the eighth anniverary of strikes 
that launched the now outlawed independent union federation

police moved in with truncheons against more than 100 
demonstrators as they marched for about 45 minutes through gdansks 
old town said a solidarity activist who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
witnesses said a melee broke out after a chair was thrown into 
the line of security police as they attempted to block the marchers 
demonstrators then hurled tables and chairs from a nearby cafe 
as the helmeted riot police rushed the crowd 
about 20 young people were injured in the clash several 
seriously and a dozen were detained the solidarity spokesman said 
the staterun news agency pap in a dispatch late sunday said 
six police officers were injured in the clash which it said was 
touched off by demonstrators behaving in an extremely aggressive 
way 
it said the protesters chanted anticommunist slogans attacked 
police with rocks and demolished a cafe pap said the demonstrators 
also interrupted the peaceful activities at a nearby fair 
it gave no details about arrests or the number of injured 
demonstrators 
the clashes came after thousands attended a service at a nearby 
church marking the anniversary of the beginning of the 1980 strike 
after the services solidarity leader lech walesa spoke to 3000 
people who had gathered outside st brygidas church a solidarity 
stronghold 
our struggle is continuing walesa said we want to live 
in a better poland with more dignity 
walesa said solidarity leaders will meet on aug 28 in gdansk to 
discuss a text on the unions future 
walesa acknowledged that much had changed since 1980 and that 
there was no return to that period 
he said the union is now committed to evolutionary 
solutions rather than radical action 
witnesses said that after the gathering at the church marchers 
made their way to the center of town which was packed with 
visitors to a local fair 
the marchers shouted solidarity slogans and were joined by large 
numbers of passersby before security forces blocked their path

on friday 2000 shipyard workers and other solidarity 
supporters attended a ceremony marking the anniversary near the 
entrance to the lenin shipyard 
police watched that ceremony but did not move in 
at that ceremony walesa helped put wreaths and flowers on a 
monument erected to honor striking shipyard workers killed by 
security forces during labor unrest in 1970 
on aug 14 1980 workers in the lenin shipyards in gdansk began 
a strike over reinstating a fired crane operator two days later 
the demands grew to include an independent trade union and 
solidarity was born 
the union at its peak claimed about 10 million members or 
nearly onethird of the nations population 
the union was crushed when martial law was imposed in 1981 it 
was banned by parliament the next year

house and senate negotiators came close to 
sealing a deal last week on overhauling the nations welfare 
system but failed at least partly because of president reagans 
continued insistence that it include some form of work requirement 
the lawmakers left town for a threeweek recess amid signs of 
increasing frustration at the reagan administrations adamant 
opposition to any bill that does not include a workfare provision 
weve said from the start if theres no work requirement 
theres no welfare reform said charles hobbs assistant to the 
president who represented the white house at meetings thursday on 
capitol hill 
but hobbs added i dont think we were the reason it fell 
apart i dont believe we were within striking distance of a deal 
at all 
intensive negotiations had progressed last week against the 
backdrop of presidential politics democratic nominee michael 
dukakis personally called some lawmakers to urge that a compromise 
be completed this year 
house members and some senators were optimistic that a daylong 
series of meetings offers and counteroffers thursday could settle 
the major differences but that was before hobbs and the white 
house put on the brakes 
there were signs at weeks end that some senate democrats closer 
to reagans position on the workfare requirements than the house 
negotiators might prefer a showdown with the white house rather 
than bow to it 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the housesenate 
negotiating team and the democratic nominee for vice president 
indicated lawmakers might send reagan a plan that doesnt meet his 
specifications 
were not going to let him dictate the contents of the bill 
bentsen said thursday 
both the house and senate bills stress parental responsibility 
for children through more intensive child support collections and 
a new emphasis on work each require states to set up largescale 
education training and work programs for welfare mothers and to 
offer child care transportation and medicaid benefits needed to 
make the programs a success 
but the house bill as passed would cost more than twice the 
fiveyear 28 billion senate plan 
house negotiators made a 11 billion concession by scrapping 
financial incentives for states to raise cash benefits and other 
compromises had brought the two sides within shouting distance by 
thursdays last offers 29 billion from the senate 33 billion 
from the house 
lawmakers thought they had found a solution thursday to concerns 
over both costs and workfare drop a requirement that twoparent 
unemployed families be eligible for welfare and along with it a 
requirement that one of the parents work 16 hours a week in a 
public job beginning in fiscal 1994 
i thought it was a real stroke of genius said arkansas gov 
bill clinton a democrat who helped dukakis lobby lawmakers last 
week by telephone but it apparently created a white house 
problem 
the reagan administration for months had threatened to veto any 
welfare overhaul bill that mandated twoparent welfare eligibility 
now allowed in only half the states but last week the white house 
insisted that the provision be kept as a vehicle for the 16hour 
work requirement 
they were removing the only work requirement thats anywhere 
in either of those bills hobbs said the presidents top 
advisors will recommend a veto if theres no work requirement 
the house conferees already have agreed to a senate provision 
also added under administration pressure requiring states to 
eventually enroll 22 percent of nonexempt welfare recipients in 
their jobs programs 
its unclear whether lawmakers when they return after labor 
day will resume discussions about dropping the twoparent 
provision or try to keep it and hammer out a compromise on the work 
requirement 
but clinton said the negotiators are so close to an overall 
agreement theres no way the whole thing could fall victim to a 
veto over this mandatory work issue 
well keep plugging away weve still got time he said

the soviet unions oncesecret blackjack 
bomber is an expanded version of americas b1b bomber according 
to the only us air force officer to have seen the giant soviet 
warplane 
maj gen gordon e fornell described the bomber in a story in 
sundays editions of the dayton daily news as being a close copy of 
the b1b from its pivoting wings to the rotary cruise missile 
launcher on its belly 
for years only the skimpiest details about the giant bomber 
were available outside the kremlin or defense department 
intelligence files 
the soviets allowed fornell and defense secretary frank c 
carlucci to take a close look at the plane on aug 2 while the two 
were on a fourday tour of soviet military bases soviet officials 
had earlier been allowed to climb aboard a b1b during a visit to 
ellsworth air force base in south dakota 
like the b1b the blackjack is designed to fly low and fast 
during longrange strategic bombing missions firing nucleartipped 
cruise missiles 
fornell a former bomber test pilot with more than 6000 flying 
hours in more than 40 types of aircraft and an adviser to carlucci 
said he believed there is evidence that the soviets copied at least 
the basic aerodynamic features of the b1b 
but he said it was impossible to tell during his 15minute 
inspection whether the blackjacks designers merely took advantage 
of public information on the b1b or profited from espionage 
its hard to determine not actually having flown the airplane 
or seen its actual combat capability what was done as far as the 
internal workings of their equipment he said 
even the crew assignments resemble the american bomber 
it has four crewmembers two pilots and what they described as 
an offensive systems operator and defense systems operator and 
the layout inside is very similar to that of the b1b he said

saluted the procession from a review platform at the royal scottish 
academy 
the 50 men and women dancers of the hungarian army ensemble 
which is on its first visit to britain will join the other army

a television network stopped broadcasting a 
historical series after producers protested that episodes were cut 
to drop references to a former president the father of an 
opposition leader a magazine said 
the private televisa network dropped the last 30 episodes from 
its rebroadcast of the 170episode path to glory epic which 
dramatizes mexican history from 1917 to the 1938 nationalization of 
mexicos oil industry by president lazaro cardenas 
cardenas son is cuauhtemoc cardenas the official runnerup in 
the july 6 presidential election the younger cardenas says he was 
fraudulently denied victory by the government and the governing 
institutional revolutionary party 
cardenas candidate of the leftofcenter national democratic 
front called for nationwide demonstrations sunday to demand the 
government clear up allegations of vote fraud 
proceso magazine reported that televisas july 30 episode of 
path to glory was altered to delete some historical facts and 
figures and create fictional characters missing from the original 
version 
televisa also announced it was suspending its broadcast of the 
series which was commissioned by the network and the governments 
social security institute 
the popular series featuring 700 actors and 5000 extras was 
broadcast in its entirety last year 
fausto zeron medina historical adviser to the series suggested 
in an interview with the magazine that the episode was censored in 
part for political reasons 
the immediate explanation is obvious the case has a political 
facet the strength that cardenism has in the current political 
dispute motivated a white hand to cut path to glory zeron 
medina said 
raul araiza director of the series said i dont know the 
cause of the mutilation but neither does that matter to me it 
appears to me to be an act of barbarism without precedent 
zeron medina protested the dropping of the episodes in letters 
to televisas president miguel aleman velasco and social security 
institute director ricardo garcia sainz 
with surprise i found that all the scenes referring to the 
presidential activities of lazaro cardenas were suppressed zeron 
medina wrote to aleman velasco 
zeron medina also told proceso that garcia sainz summoned him to 
a meeting at the institute in march about two months after the 
rebroadcast of path to glory began 
there in his office he told me that mr president had asked 
him to be careful with the army with the relatives of the 
historical figures with the heroes and religious sentiments 
zeron medina said 
when asked which president garcia sainz responded that of 
the republic zeron medina said mexicos outgoing president is 
miguel de la madrid 
a televisa spokesman reached by telephone said the network would 
not have any comment on the matter until monday 
lazaro cardenas ensured his stature as perhaps the most revered 
of mexican presidents when he nationalized the oil industry he 
also distributed millions of acres of land to peasants under 
mexicos agrarian reform law 
the elder cardenas died in 1970 
cuauhtemoc cardenas has claimed he defeated governing party 
candidate carlos salinas de gortari in the july 6 election he was 
a member of the governing party before resigning last year to mount 
his own candidacy 
the chamber of deputies sitting as the electoral college 
begins a session monday to ratify the election results 
opposition parties accused televisa of progovernment bias in 
covering the presidential campaign and of virtually ignoring 
postelection protests

a panhandler in greenwich village puts his pitch 
to a rap beat 
give a contribution 
to fight destitution 
without retribution 
moneys the solution 
mayor edward i koch however believes the solution is to put 
up posters in the subways telling new yorkers to pass that beggar 
by 
in most cases in my judgment the money that you give in the 
street to beggars goes for booze and drugs koch said last week 
it is not in the best interest of this city to encourage people 
to panhandle instead of looking for jobs 
for many new yorkers every day brings an encounter with two 
three or more beggars shouting mendicants who move from car to car 
on the subways with tales of lost homes unemployment or aids 
passive panhandlers slouched on the street behind placards saying 
homeless and hungry street psychologists who can mug a 
queasy conscience with a soft god bless you after being turned 
down 
the best thing you can do if you really want to help koch 
said is to give any such charitable contributions to your church 
or your synagogue or the salvation army or a whole host of 
legitimate agencies that will then use the money for a valid and 
good purpose not for booze and drugs 
there is nothing wrong about giving money to organizations 
said ed abrahams new york director of the coalition for the 
homeless but i dont think when people pass a panhandler they 
say theres 25 cents that i wont give to my church this week 
kochs antibegging pronouncements have cut down on 
contributions but not as much as we thought it would a 
panhandler on fifth avenue who identified himself as gerry said 
sunday morning 
as for the fear that the money goes for drugs and alcohol it 
just isnt true said the softspoken whitehaired man who said 
he has been on the street since january i would say i know an 
awful lot of panhandlers that its less than 5 percent 
there are a lot of drug addicts out here said a panhandler 
up the street who identified himself as ed p they need 8090 a 
day some of them get it and shoot it right up 
if i make 20 a day thats not too bad said ed who sleeps 
outside the museum of modern art and insists that he is a 
panhandler not a beggar panhandler sounds better he said 
a panhandler doesnt steal 
asked why begging is so prevalent koch said i guess because 
were easy marks 
a survey of 250 people commissioned by crains new york business 
earlier this year found that twothirds gave money to beggars and 
51 percent said they contributed to organizations that help the 
homeless 
the metropolitan transit authority surveyed 1200 new yorkers 
and found that three out of five gave money to beggars although 80 
percent said they found the panhandlers annoying 
tourists dont give you money said gerry who was all but 
ignored by passersby native new yorkers give you money 
begging isnt illegal in new york though panhandlers may be 
encouraged to move 
seattle prodded by downtown merchants who were afraid of losing 
their customers enacted an ordinance last year to ban aggressive 
panhandling that inspired laws this year in minneapolis and tulsa 
okla while portland ore went after aggressive beggars last 
year by making it illegal to interfere with pedestrians 
terry grace director of development for the soup kitchen at 
holy apostles episcopal church in manhattan endorsed kochs 
advice if you give money directly to beggars they might not use 
it to get food she said 
but the rev bill greenlaw of holy apostles called the mayors 
position utterly gratuitous and insensitive 
im assaulted as is everyone else by people with their hands 
out greenlaw said im offended by that too but the answer 
it seems to me is not to advise people not to respond 
if the goal is to force beggars to rely on government and 
charitable programs greenlaw added there just arent enough 
programs 
his church which has 125 members serves up to 1000 people in 
its soup kitchen every day in addition to taking 300 or so bag 
lunches to women and children in dilapidated hotels 
douglas platt executive director of the first moraviangrand 
central dropin center said 90 percent of the homeless who visit 
that center suffer some kind of chemical dependence 
many panhandlers are ignored by the social service system 
platt wrote in the new york times but the frustrating truth is 
that these outofpocket donations only aggravate the problems they 
are meant to relieve 
the root of the problem abrahams said is that welfare payments 
are below the poverty level if you have a place to live you may 
have to decide between paying the rent and buying food he said 
begging is not an equitable way to deal with the problem or 
an efficient way but its the only way for some people abrahams 
said

one of the most popular figures in the early days of television

adm elmo r zumalt jr who ordered 
the use of agent orange in vietnam says the cancer death of his 
son moves him to work harder for compensation for other veterans 
affected by the toxic defoliant 
there are still many hundreds of veterans who do need help 
zumwalt said saturday the day his son died i believe very 
strongly now that the evidence is clear that the agent orange is 
responsible for the problems many veterans are having 
elmo r zumwalt iii 42 who was exposed to agent orange died 
at his home in fayetteville he was diagnosed in january 1983 as 
having nonhodgkins lymphoma two years later doctors found he had 
lymphoma hodgkins disease 
zumwalts son elmo russell zumwalt iv suffers from a 
congenital dysfunction that confuses his physical senses 
since the war adm zumwalt and his son had pushed for 
government assistance to veterans affected by agent orange 
on june 30 the us supreme court removed the last legal 
obstacle to a 180 million settlement between vietnam veterans and 
the manufacturers of agent orange the justices let stand rulings 
that dismissed lawsuits by about 300 veterans who had challenged 
the 1984 settlement 
in washington a white house spokesman said the president and 
mrs reagan are deeply saddened and extend their prayers to the 
zumwalt family 
the younger zumwalt was commanding a boat along the rivers of 
the ca mau peninsula when his father the american naval commander 
in vietnam ordered the spraying of agent orange to defoliate the 
jungle along the waterways in order to save servicemen by depriving 
the enemy of concealment for ambushes 
before the spraying us forces had a 6 percent casualty rate 
each month afterward that figure dropped to less than 1 percent 
i do not second guess the decisions dad made in vietnam nor 
do i doubt for a minute that the saving of human life was always 
his first priority in his conduct of the war the younger zumwalt 
once said i have the greatest love and admiration for him as a 
man and the deepest respect for him as a military leader 
young zumwalt once swam through water doused with agent orange 
to collect weapons from a convoy of viet cong boats winning over a 
hostile crew that had called him the little admiral and brass 
brat behind his back 
the zumwalts chronicled their battle with cancer in 1986 with 
the book my father my son which they wrote with author john 
pekkanen the book was presented in a madefortelevision movie in 
may 
zumwalt said his son was strong until the end even joking and 
teasing with family members during conversations that began friday 
evening 
we had a long conversation his wife and children and his 
brother and me with him from about 730 friday night until about 
1 oclock this morning the admiral said saturday he was 
rational and very courageous 
zumwalt was standing by his sons side with other family members 
when his son died in his sleep

a sprightly new production of rossinis the 
barber of seville has been added to the new york city opera 
repertoire 
at the second performance in the new york state theater on 
saturday erie mills was rosina gran wilson was count almaviva 
robert orth was figaro and jan opalach was rosinas guardian dr 
bartolo 
lofti mansouri directed stage action which was lively but not 
eccentric desmond heeley who has designed prestigious stage and 
opera productions in london and at the metropolitan opera designed 
sets and costumes some of miss mills costumes looked like those 
of rosinas soon after the operas premiere in 1816 
the set was attractive with a facade centered inside an 
archway the facade was turned around to become either an outside 
door with street in front of it or the inside door of a room 
miss mills seems so natural as rosina her singing so delightful 
and her acting so charming that it would be easy simply to accept 
and ignore her thinking about it later one recognizes and 
appreciates her artistry 
figaro was dressed in a green velvet suit trimmed with orange 
with orths toothy smile he presents himself originally as an 
early 19th century nerd this figaro smoothed out into a pleasant 
fellow rather than the character he sometimes is 
wilson has a sweet tenor that does not turn cloying and hes a 
slim elegant count he also acted so effectively in his 
impersonations as an elderly drunk soldier and a singing teacher 
that he added much to the mirth of this barber opalach in a 
gray wig that stuck out like donkey ears on each side sang with 
conviction and was amusing as bartolo 
harry dworchak as the real singing teacher and jane shaulis as 
bartolos housekeeper sang well and james billings made the tiny 
part of a sleepy servant greatly amusing every time he was on stage 
music director sergiu comissiona conducted 
the opera was sung in italian english surtitles in white 
flashed on a screen above the stage but were overlighted and left 
on the screen so briefly that most of them couldnt be read

they were down there all last night praying and lighting 
candles and singing said col ray huffman of the lubbock police

aids has spawned a new kind of hypochondriac 
people convinced they are infected by the aids virus despite 
medical evidence to the contrary a psychologist who has treated 
such people said sunday 
even monthly blood tests for up to a year have failed to quell 
the fear in some of them said miami psychologist larry harmon in 
many cases the fear stems from guilt over a past sexual incident 
these people are terrified and their condition can make 
them avoid sex with their spouses for fear of infecting them and 
disrupt their concentration at work harmon said 
one of his patients was afraid to hold his newborn baby for fear 
of infecting the child he said in an interview 
harmon discussed treatment of people with afraids which 
stands for acute fear regarding aids at the annual meeting of the 
american psychological association 
when anxiety and depression causes such symptoms as weight loss 
fatigue or reduced resistance to disease afflicted people 
interpret the symptoms as signs of aids he said 
even a bruise from a bumped elbow may be perceived as the mark 
of an aidsrelated cancer called kaposis sarcoma he said 
he said he has treated 10 patients since seeing his first case 
two years ago and other psychologists have told him they are 
seeing it too but he did not have any figures on how many cases 
might exist 
the problem often is rooted in guilt over an extramarital 
affair a visit to a prostitute or a homosexual experience he 
said sometimes the experience occurred years before 
sex with an infected person can spread the aids virus 
one man harmon treated married for 10 years had had sex wih a 
female neighbor about a month later he heard his minister describe 
aids as punishment for sins and about a week after that he noticed 
he had lost weight and suffered diarrhea both were due to anxiety 
but the man interpreted them as evidence of aids harmon said 
his worry persisted after a blood test proved negative and he 
was referred to harmon by an aids hot line 
most people can significantly reduce their anxiety with 
treatment he said therapists can explain the facts about acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome and explain how people who are worried 
tend to become overconcerned by coughs or other symptoms most 
people would ignore 
harmon asks his patients to carry copies of negative blood test 
results in their wallets he also teaches them about reducing 
anxiety by focusing on their present lives and what is going on 
around them and dealing with guilt 
harmon said people who recognize the problem in themselves or 
others should contact an aids hot line for the name of a 
psychologist familiar with aidsrelated issues

captured a key provincial capital after troops left the commander 
of soviet forces in afghanistan said 
lt gen boris gromov said at a news conference in the afghan 
capital kabul that none of the troops he commands remains in 25 
of afghanistans 30 provinces the official tass news agency 
reported

half its estimated 100000 troops out by monday 
usbacked moslem guerrillas fired missiles at the afghan 
capital kabul and shelled two other afghan cities killing 19 
people the news agency said sunday

and 96 terrorist and diversionary operations gromov told reporters 
he confirmed western reports that rebels took control of the 
northern provincial capital of kunduz after soviet troops left the 
area in the first week of august tass quoted him as saying he 
had no doubt that in the very near future afghanistans 
marxist government would regain control 
kunduz lies 40 miles south of the soviet border along a major 
road leading from kabul to the soviet union 
reports reaching islamabad pakistan said almost all provincial 
capitals remain in communist hands guerrillas have seized three 
provincial capitals since may 15 but abandoned them later under 
heavy soviet aerial bombardment 
red army troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 under 
unmediated peace accords signed in geneva in april all the 
troops are to be out by feb 15

spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters the soviets appear 
to be on schedule in withdrawing from afghanistan under the geneva

forces will steadfastly defend the republic strengthen vigilance 
and battlereadiness on this score i as the head of the general 
staff have no doubts col gen shah nawaz tanai told the soviet

military leaves even a former soviet military adviser in 
afghanistan maj gen kim m tsagolov has expressed doubt the 
afghan army can hold its own after the soviet pullout 
tanai in the newspaper interview acknowledged rebels were 
focusing their attacks on areas evacuated by soviet troops but

democrats taking up the chant where 
was george might be tempted to ask their own vice presidential 
nominee lloyd bentsen where is george 
bentsen campaigning in the state both he and bush call home 
hardly ever mentions the vice president his barbs even when 
clearly aimed at bush start with the reagan administration or 
the republicans or simply they 
around the country democratic partisans recite where was 
george as both a rallying cry and chide to bush as failing to 
speak up when the administration made policy gaffes like the sale 
of arms to iran 
bentsen denied in an interview with reporters that he is making 
any special effort to avoid discussing bush by name but even in 
the small group covering his campaign he is keeping his jibes 
subtle 
im going to make the issues and pound on them and thats what 
im trying to do the texas senator said 
bentsens aides say there are several reasons not to attack bush 
directly chief among them the vice presidents own texas 
background texans may not warm to personal attacks against one of 
their own 
in addition while bentsen and bush are not political allies 
they and their families are privately friendly according to both 
sides the vice president himself has been holding fire saying 
hes running against democratic presidential nominee mike dukakis 
and not bentsen who is one of texas most popular figures 
bentsen seems to be returning the favor for example he 
declined to comment on a published report that bush has been 
misrepresenting his war record 
im not going to get into that what happens in combat said 
bentsen himself a world war ii bomber pilot im not going to 
question his story at all 
but while theres cordiality now the political climate is 
heating up bush has announced plans to move some of his national 
campaign operation to texas 
it doesnt worry me hes had his operations here before 
bentsen said of bush referring to the 1970 campaign when the two 
men last faced each other in an election and bentsen won 
bentsen says he is prepared to take the gloves off and start 
pounding bush when it becomes necessary 
im sure we will be as we go along he said lets see how 
the campaign develops ive attacked the issues and this 
administration of which he is a major part

massachusetts republicans believe they have a 
special role at the national convention providing other delegates 
an inside look at the democrat they love to hate michael dukakis 
the people from massachusetts know mike dukakis best and they 
will help call attention to the massachusetts mirage and help to 
describe who mike dukakis really is said andrew card a former 
white house aide and state representative who has rejoined the bush 
campaign the delegation will act as a truth squad of sorts he 
said 
joseph malone the former state gop executive director who is 
running against sen edward m kennedy dmass said he has talked 
to georgia republicans who lament the fact that they never really 
got the message out about how bad jimmy carter would be for 
america we dont want to repeat that mistake 
the massachusetts delegation will be the most wellinformed 
delegation in terms of mike dukakis and theres a responsibility 
on our part that other republicans throughout the nation know the 
facts malone said 
dukakis has been the chief target of state republicans since he 
won his first gubernatorial race in 1974 he is in his 10th year as 
governor losing a reelection bid in 1978 and returning to office 
in 1983 
state republicans believe the nation is getting a skewed view of 
dukakis through television 
he is holding himself out now as something he really isnt at 
all portraying himself as a moderate and in some cases a 
conservative said assistant senate republican leader david locke 
hes an authentic duespaying cardcarrying textbook 
liberal thats what hes always been but thats not the image he 
portrays locke said i think we might be helpful to the other 
delegations who are looking for an inside view of dukakis 
massachusetts republican chairman ray shamie plans to unveil a 
video tuesday produced by the state committee that attacks dukakis 
on issues from the environment to the budget state party officials 
plan to distribute the tape to the other 49 state party chiefs 
but the massachusetts delegation does not have any plans to 
dispatch delegates to various convention caucuses in a formal way 
weve discussed that and my understanding is that we will just 
wait to be pounced upon said house gop leader steven pierce

a strong earthquake occurred sunday near the 
coast of central chile the pacific tsunami warning center 
reported there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries 
the earthquake at 153 pm edt registered 65 on the richter 
scale but did not generate a pacificwide tsunami or sea wave 
the center here said 
the national earthquake information center in golden colo 
said the quake was felt strongly in caldera chile about 400 miles 
north of santiago capital of the south american country 
the magnitude was the largest recorded in that general area 
since a quake measuring 73 occurred oct 4 1983 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 65 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 55 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage 
the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred before the 
richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 on the richter 
scale

president reagan lauded his loyal vice 
president for strength vision and true grit sunday as he 
arrived in a republican national convention city where speculation 
swirled endlessly about george bushs choice of a running mate 
the masquerade is over its time to talk issues to use the 
dreaded l word to say the policies of our opposition and the 
congressional leadership of his party are liberal liberal 
liberal reagan said in prepared remarks for a campaign rally a 
few blocks from the new orleans convention hall 
bush was at home in washington his nomination set for next 
wednesday night satisfied to let reagan start the ball rolling on 
a week worth of dukakisbashing 
talk of a running mate dominated the political discussion in the 
sweltering city and many of the contenders made the rounds of the 
morning talk shows before plunging into another day of 
preconvention receptions 
sen bob dole put in a plug for his wife elizabeth and 
insisted despite evidence to the contrary that he wasnt 
campaigning for the post himself sen alan simpson described 
himself as a liability and asked bush to tap dole bob that 
is sen dan quayle expressed the hope that he might be 
acceptable to the whole party 
attorney general richard thornburgh sworn in only friday 
sounded ready to swap jobs i have a job to do for this president 
and until ive heard anything from the vice president im ready to 
go to work as attorney general he said 
a chain link security fence sprang up overnight around the 
superdome one more strand in the web of security at the hall where 
republicans will spend four days praising extolling bush and aiming 
barbs at democratic candidate michael dukakis 
inside in one of the hundreds of rooms that ring the vast 
convention floor a squad of republican speechwriters reviewed 
scripts submitted by dozens of speakers to make sure they would fit 
within the allotted time 
dukakis was on cape cod while running mate lloyd bentsen 
resumed a campaign tour of texas bentsen has generally avoided 
mentioning fellow texan bush by name and he told reporters im 
trying to make the issues and pound on them and thats what im 
trying to do 
the preconvention weekend approximated an endless moveable 
party from a mississippi river dinner cruise for the yankees from 
new hampshire to an extravagant bash for 5000 guests hosted by the 
citys newspaper the timespicayune 
were party animals right shouted eduardo castellouvogel 
one of the 700 volunteers recruited to make sure delegates arriving 
at the new orleans airport were in the proper frame of mind 
its the heart of the big easy explained nita minter over 
from slidell la for the festivities 
reagans appearance at the downtown rally was one of two 
speeches on his new orleans schedule his remarks to the delegates 
monday night were set up as the highlight of the opening session of 
the convention 
the president and bush will meet only briefly tuesday morning 
before the president leaves town in a carefully choreographed 
sequence designed to show bush emerging as the new leader of the 
republican party 
in his remarks to republicans in gathered a few blocks from the 
superdome reagan ripped into the democrats 
the party of yes has become the party of no said 
reagan who was a democrat until 1962 
the president accused the democrats of saying no to holding 
the line on taxes to spending cuts and on other issues ranging 
from the death penalty to the school prayer amendment the 
televised interviews added little or nothing to the sum of 
knowledge about the only mystery of the republican convention week 
and bush said nothing to help 
he had lunch at his official residence in washington with james 
baker iii his top campaign adviser then worked on his acceptance 
speech with roger ailes his media consultant and debate coach 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller said the necessary work 
had been completed on eight to 10 vice presidential candidates in 
advance of bushs pick although he declined to be drawn into a 
discussion of any of them 
he will make a selection that this convention will ratify 
heartily said lee atwater bushs combative campaign manager 
there was no doubt about that especially since the vice 
president commanded the loyalty of all but a few dozen delegates 
pledged to former television evangelist pat robertson 
sen gordon humphrey less defiant than last week pledged to 
support the vice presidents selection but still warned of a 
conservative gap if bush didnt make a rightminded pick we 
want a flesh and blood conservative he said on abcs this week 
with david brinkley 
sen lowell weicker voiced a rebuttal calling bush a moderate 
conservative who does not share all the views of the far right 
theyve saddled him with a platform that as far as im concerned 
you can pour bacmk in the horse 
simpson of wyoming said on nbcs meet the press that he has 
asked bush not to consider him for the ticket ive had a very 
checkered career said the no 2 man in the republican party in 
the senate ive punched the lights out of a lot of sacred 
cowsi would be a liability for george 
the plusses and minuses about the contenders was easy to figure 
one party source said kansas sen dole popular in a region 
where bush ran poorly in the primaries was lobbying strongly 
behind the scenes for the job and had relayed assurances that he 
would toe the line that bushs handlers would lay down for him but 
one bush aide said opposition within the camp was strong largely 
because of doles penchant for cutting remarks such as his demand 
that bush stop lying about my record during the primary

association spurned by george bush and other republican 
candidates said sunday she sees a broad common ground between 
her union and the gop 
mary hatwood futrell in a pep talk to the small group of nea 
members who are republican delegates expresed chagrin that the 
vice president did not seek the neas endorsement nor grant her 
request for a private meeting 
bush was not alone most of bushs former rivals also declined 
to fill out the neas political questionnaires or sit for a 
videotaped interview by futrell 
the union has been an ardent backer of the democratic candidate 
in every election since 1976 and an implacable foe of the 
education and budget policies of the reaganbush administration 
calling hers a bipartisan organization futrell said i 
believe that there is a broad common ground between nea and the 
republican party 
she said the nea supports the gops calls for high standards and 
improved accountability for schools teachers and students for a 
greater emphasis on religious and moral values and for more 
attention to the needs of disadvantaged students 
she didnt mention some other gop platform positions including 
support for merit pay tuition tax credits and home schooling 
that her union opposes 
the nea endorsed michael dukakis for the democratic presidential 
nomination a few weeks before the democratic convention it is 
waiting until sept 8 to make a formal endorsement for the general 
election after canvassing the 8400 nea delegates who attended its 
convention here last month 
the nea which boasted nearly 300 democratic delegates and 92 
alternates in atlanta has 25 of its members among the gop 
delegates plus nine alternates according to a preliminary tally 
the 19 millionmember union which estimates that 600000 of 
its members are republicans is giving each delegate 1000 to

a small group of united nations military 
observers left for the front sunday to prepare for the un 
peacekeeping force that will monitor a ceasefire in the war 
between iran and iraq 
the team from the un iraniraq military observer group was 
expected to return to the iranian capital monday after checking 
logistical needs for the peacekeepers 
a diplomatic source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the location of the border is not expected to cause major 
negotiating problems the un observers primary job will be to 
make sure that no one violates the truce the source said 
forces of both countries are now positioned along the border as 
hammered out in a 1975 treaty iran wants the ceasefire agreement 
to be based on that treaty the algiers accords which gave them 
half of the shattalarab waterway 
iraq has repudiated that agreement and the struggle for control 
over the waterway helped start the fighting in september 1980 the 
shattalarab the delta of the tigris and euphrates rivers is 
iraqs only outlet to the sea at the persian gulf 
iran on july 18 accepted a un ceasefire resolution that iraq 
accepted soon after it was passed in july 1987 the ceasefire is 
to begin officially on aug 20 
un resolution 598 said the un force is to to verify 
confirm and supervise the ceasefire and withdrawal to 
internationally recognized borders 
an informed source who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
turkish finnish and swedish representatives are expected to join 
the un advance team on monday military representatives from 
austria denmark canada and australia are already in iran 
a similar team is working in the iraqi capital baghdad 
the advance team is laying groundwork for a 350member unarmed 
un peacekeeping force to monitor the border while the two 
countries hold direct talks set to begin aug 25 
in baghdad iraqi president saddam hussein said sunday his 
nation forced iran into agreeing to a truce by defeating it on the 
battlefield 
he also called on his people to redouble efforts to rebuild 
postwar iraq 
the decision of peace was taken by iraq and not by iran nor 
by the un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
hussein told his cabinet in an address shown on staterun 
television 
we believed right from the beginning that peace could not be 
achieved unless iraq wins the battle he said and iraq won the 
battle when it rendered iran incapable of continuing the war 
irans acceptance of the ceasefire followed defeats by iraqi 
troops who recaptured the faw peninsula the majnoon islands and 
land near the southern port city of basra 
in a related development tehran radio quoted iranian president 
ali khamenei as saying sunday that iran would not accept any 
alterations in resolution 598 
it is possible that the aggressor enemy which follows no 
principle will try to change the un resolution but we insist 
that we will not accept any change in the articles of the 
resolution not even a word he said 
the president spoke to a group of troops manning antiaircraft 
batteries along the southern front khamenei told the troops that 
despite the expected end of the war they should remain alert

pacific said he was eager to watch the convention delegates

thats the model for televisions franks place they were 
staying in the rollicking french quarter and alice and howard 
frazier of woodmont conn who organized the peace cruise said

a plo delegation ended three days of talks 
with jordanian leaders sunday and officials said they agreed that 
jordan would take no further measures to abolish its influence in 
the west bank and gaza strip 
the palestine liberation organization also reasserted its desire 
for confederation with jordan after a palestinian state has been 
established 
a senior palestinian leader was quoted in a parisbased weekly 
as saying the plo is leaning toward establishing a provisional 
government in the israelioccupied territories instead of a 
governmentinexile 
the newspaper journal du dimanche quoted salah khalaf deputy 
chairman of plo chief yasser arafats fatah wing as saying in an 
interview that the decision on a provisional government might be 
taken at a meeting next month of the palestine national council 
the organizations legislature 
the amman meetings were the first highlevel discussions between 
jordanian and plo officials since king husseins decision two weeks 
ago to renounce jordans claim to sovereignty over the west bank of 
the jordan river 
hussein also canceled a 13 billion west bank development plan 
ended payments to thousands of civil servants in the occupied 
territories and suspended the lower chamber of jordans parliament 
half of the members of the lower house were from the west bank 
the king said he was turning over to the plo full responsibility 
for the occupied territories 
but a plo statement issued sunday night in amman indicated the 
plo did not want further jordanian moves to remove its influence in 
the west bank and gaza strip captured by israel from jordan and 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
the statement said both sides came to agreement that jordan 
will provide all facilities and measures that serve the interests 
and the life of our people in the occupied territories 
plo executive committee member abdullah horani told reporters 
sunday night that jordan will continue to keep open the jordan 
river bridges to the west bank will continue to issue jordanian 
passports to west bank residents and will maintain its oversight of 
west bank schools 
most of the 850000 palestinians in the west bank and many of 
the 650000 palestinians in the gaza strip hold jordanian 
passports a majority of the 28 million residents of jordan are 
from families who fled from palestine in the 1948 and 1967 wars 
with israel 
the plo statement said jordan made clear that people of 
palestinian origin have full rights of citizenship but also 
would retain their rights in palestine including the right to 
repatriation and selfdetermination 
referring indirectly to tensions caused by husseins break with 
the west bank the plo said it expressed deep concern for the 
stability of jordan and its national unity 
it restated its call for an eventual palestinian confederation 
with jordan horani said said that would occur only after a 
palestinian state is established on the ground 
palestinian officials here confirmed the statements by khalaf 
that creation of a provisional government might be considered by 
the palestine national council 
horani said no date for the council session has been set 
although it is supposed to be held this month or early next month 
in algiers 
palestinian leaders have suggested a provisional government 
would strengthen their indirect recognition of israels right to 
exist but prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel has rejected the 
idea of talks with any such government 
israel also has said it would not permit the formation of a 
palestinian state in the occupied territories 
for 25 years the arabs refused to talk peace with israel and 
now its israel which says no khalaf told the journal du 
dimanche 
my solution for peace is a palestinian state a discussion to 
establish the borders of this state and mutual recognition of 
israel and palestine he was quoted as saying 
he said the plo was thinking seriously of creating a 
palestinian state with a provisional government legitimately 
established whose political program would be completely different 
from the plos current charter 
that charter has been a major block to american and israeli 
talks with the plo because it calls for the elimination of israel

it is sunday morning on the day before the 
republican national convention and in the cool confines of the 
cathedral of st louis the rev frank montalbano invokes gods 
blessing for the coming gathering in the superdome 
we want to thank you for joining us from everywhere says 
montalbano dont wait for the next republican convention to come 
and see us 
he judiciously avoids anything that might be construed as 
partisan catholics are from everywhere he says thats what 
being catholic is about 
the cathedral the oldest in america is on jackson square in 
the french quarter the square is marked with a new sign declaring 
it place jean paul deux a reminder that the pope worshipped 
there during his visit last year 
in fact there is a kneeler on the left side of the altar used 
by john paul ii and no one else 
outside the cathedral dr love is hanging his paintings on the 
iron fence enclosing the park on jackson square each painting uses 
the word love in some manner in the shape of buildings of 
shrubbery as geometric shapes he is hoping republicans will find 
the message appealing 
his best seller he says is a painting that spells the word 
right side up or upside down in blue for males and pink for 
females the painting is hung so it will rotate easily and dr love 
hes really mt holubar explains a complicated ritual for 
which side is up that sends a message from one partner to the other 
sideways he says is a symbol of neutrality which is usually 
the way he feels about political parties except of course this 
week 
in new orleans this week everybody loves the republicans 
cabdrivers love them restaurant owners love them and shopkeepers 
love them there is even nostalgia for a republican reviled in the 
past a popular tshirt bears the legend tanned rested and 
ready nixon in 88 
a man who sculptures balloons who says his name is simply 
clown when he is at work is specializing this week in elephant 
trunks what does everybody from washington have in common he 
asks they have their nose in government 
its only 9 am but jackson square already is steamy 
delegates seemingly early risers are strolling about you can 
tell that they are delegates because they already are wearing tags 
around their necks even though its a day early 
the painters who display their wares against the jackson square 
fence every day are in the spirit of the week one has a portrait 
of ronald reagan in a gallery that also includes cory aquino 
another displays one of george bush looking as he did about 20 
years ago 
in the sunsplashed cafe du monde republicans from out of town 
are performing a delectable new orleans ritual drinking chicory 
coffee and eating beignets those square sugarpowdered 
confections that compare to doughnuts as steak does to meat loaf 
outside two sidewalk musicians are entertaining on the trombone 
one plays a jazz rendition of let me call you sweetheart 
it seems an appropriate new orleans serenade to their visitors

israel closed the gaza strip and confined 
residents to their homes sunday after widespread rioting in the 
occupied lands arab sources said 25 palestinians were wounded and 
israel said a firebomb thrown at a van burned six israelis 
including an infant 
the wounded israelis were among several families traveling to 
visit relatives at the jewish settlement of neve dekalim in the 
gaza strip said menachem beithalachmi spokesman for the gush 
katif jewish settlement council 
as the van passed the strips bureij refugee camp one of a 
group of arabs hurled a bottle filled with gasoline that broke 
through the vehicles windshield he said 
an 8monthold child was in critical condition with facial 
burns israel radio said it said three children ages 2 8 and 11 
and a teenager and an adult received light to moderate injures 
troops sealed the area and searched for suspects the radio said 
we had a meeting with the army tonight and they promised to 
take a series of tough actions beithalachmi said 
also sunday the army said a 21yearold gaza man died of wounds 
sustained during the weekend the death brings to 243 the number of 
arabs killed since the palestinian uprising began dec 8 four 
israelis also have died 
the armys curfew on the gaza strip means all 650000 residents 
of gaza will be confined to their homes indefinitely a military 
spokesman said 
residents will be barred from traveling to jobs in israel and 
journalists will be allowed into the area only if accompanied by a 
military official the army said 
it was the second time the entire gaza strip had been placed 
under curfew since the palestinian revolt began the army took a 
similar measure in march 
shopkeepers in the seaside strip opened their stores just after 
830 pm enabling residents to stock up on food before the 10 
pm when the curfew went into effect 
the riots in gaza apparently were triggered by the deaths of two 
gazan workers who were burned while sleeping at an israeli 
construction site near tel aviv last week local reporters said 
police have said jewish extremists may have set the fire 
troops shot and wounded at least 21 palestinians in gaza and 
four in the west bank arab reporters said the overall number was 
confirmed by hospital officials the reporters said a 48yearold 
gaza city man lost an eye when he was hit by a rubber bullet 
an army spokesman said he did not know of the eye injury and put 
the number of wounded at 13 
the army announced the curfew after closing most of the 
140squaremile strip to outside visitors and restricting at least 
187000 residents to their homes throughout the day journalists 
were forced to leave the area israel radio said 
the curfew is to remain into effect until further notice 
the army announcement said residents will not be allowed to 
enter israel and residents coming back from work will be allowed 
to enter the gaza strip only at hours set by the military 
government 
at least half of gazas residents commute daily to jobs in 
israeli restaurants factories and farms 
the date at which the gaza strip will be reopened to traffic 
will be decided upon according to circumstances the army said 
the statement said the measure was taken to undermine 
residents readiness to respond to calls to engage in public 
disorder 
underground leaflets from moslem fundamentalist groups called 
for demonstrations to coincide with the islamic new year 1409 and 
israeli officials said they expected a new wave of unrest 
six of the shootings in gaza took place in the jabaliya refugee 
camp on the outskirts of gaza city two of those wounded were 
18yearolds who suffered gunshot wounds in the arms or legs said 
officials at al ahli arab and shifa hospitals 
other injuries occurred in the shati refugee camp and the sheikh 
radwan and tufah neighborhoods of gaza city said the officials

the drought hasnt flooded dowsers with 
work and some say its because people are skeptical of their 
powers to find water 
i havent had any calls and im surprised said dugie kane 
42 one of 65 people who attended the illianna dowsers convention 
saturday 
kane an 18year veteran of dowsing and his fellow dowsers 
believe their skills help them find underground water oil and 
other resources some also say they use dowsing for healing 
purposes 
some dowsers who are sometimes called water witches use 
pendulums while others use reeds or forked branches still others 
say they have become so practiced at dowsing they can tell where 
water is without using an instrument 
kane said doubts about their powers may keep some people away 
a lot of people arent going to call because of that reason 
said kane of edwardsville near st louis but common sense 
tells me if i need water and someone can help im going to take a 
shot at it right now i think a lot of people are afraid its going 
to cost them too much to drill a well 
dowser dale bingham 72 of nearby vandalia agreed price may 
keep people away he said drilling a well can cost a minimum of 
several thousand dollars bingham however says he has watched 
farmers come to vandalias water treatment plant this summer to 
haul water with their trucks 
for them to haul water is unnecessary because there is water 
on their land bingham said but a dowser will never push 
himself on anyone 
bingham said has dowsed thousands of wells in 40 years and said 
he has been wrong only once bingham and kane dont charge for 
their watersearching services 
if you want to have a well call in a well driller and have 
them dig it but if you want water in that well you better put it 
where theres water bingham said

heavy rains pushed the two main branches 
of the nile river over their banks sunday swamping huge sections 
of central sudan and worsening a disaster that already has left 2 
million people homeless news reports said 
the reports said the blue nile and white nile which converge at 
khartoum to form the nile were overflowing sunday south of this 
capital city 
finance minister omar nour eldayem told reporters saturday the 
floods have killed at least 58 people injured 213 and destroyed 
167000 houses in the khartoum area 
irrigation minister mahmoud beshir gamma said damage was 
expected to extend from central and northern sudan into egyptian 
territory 
an egyptian newspaper alahram in a dispatch from khartoum 
said in its monday editions that the two nile tributaries on sunday 
spilled across a region south of khartoum until only tree tops 
remained visible 
the elgezira district in central sudan between the two 
branches of the nile is one of the countrys richest agricultural 
zones it produces cotton a leading export and a loss of the crop 
could prove disastrous sudans already faltering economy 
for the past 10 days khartoum and other cities in central 
eastern and northern sudan have suffered floods caused by heavy 
rains that officials said are the worst in the countrys history 
more than 1200 tons of relief supplies including tents 
medicine and food have arrived in khartoum from donors worldwide 
but nour eldayem told a news conference in khartoum the aid is 
insufficient for the millions affected by the floods 
richard mosovy a member of the committee coordinating the 
relief operation denied reports that aid was being withheld from 
some 750000 people who fled the civil war and drought in southern 
sundan and moved into squatter camps that ring khartoum 
it just so happens that those living in outlying areas are 
inaccessible to those distributing food mosovy told reporters 
some journalists have said they saw no evidence of aid being 
distributed in the camps and there were reports of some supplies 
being diverted to the army nour eldayem denied that and said 
the army is giving its supplies to the people 
intestinal infections and diarrhea epidemics have broken out in 
many settlements from people drinking unclean water the world 
health organizations representative told international relief 
agencies saturday 
dr nicholas ward said cholera was an immediate risk with 
outbreaks of malaria and typhoid expected within weeks

osman geragandi koko looked at the mounds 
of mud above the surface of water covering the flooded shanty town 
of jebel kusha arabic for mountain of garbage 
seven thousand families lived where there now is water said 
koko 32 a squatter in the northern khartoum settlement of jebel 
kusha the government has brought no relief 
the muddy mounds are all that remain of thousands of hovels 
destroyed since torrential rains began in central sudan on aug 4 
leaving the desert capital of khartoum awash and sending the white 
nile and blue nile rivers over their banks 
government officials have said 58 people have perished in the 
floods that destroyed some 167000 houses and left up to 2 million 
people homeless 
authorities acknowledge that little has been accomplished so far 
in providing aid to the victims but they blame insufficient 
supplies and the suddenness and scope of the catastrophe 
in a matter of hours towns and millions of people were 
submerged omer el din head of the national flood emergency 
committee said saturday 
jebel kusha was among the areas hardest hit 
it is one of 23 squatter camps ringing khartoum that hold an 
estimated 500000 people who fled the civil war and drought in 
southern sudan and sought refuge in the capital 
many of the mud huts in jebel kusha disintegrated under the 
rains and the floods created a lake with kneehigh waters that 
extends for more than a half mile from the settlement to the 
village of esba 
women and children with plastic jugs and containers waded 
through the muddy lake to get to esba where they begged for clean 
water 
we have been suffering for the last 10 days said koko 
acting as a spokesman for the 15000 people at jebel kusha 
nobody has come we are sick we are hungry he told a group of 
visiting journalists

a utah teenager who is one of youngest 
delegates to the republican national convention says he hopes to 
amend the party platform to reflect mormon family values 
steve densley a freshman at mormon churchowned brigham young 
university wants a platform plank recommending that american 
families meet together weekly to discuss moral issues such as 
illicit drug use and avoiding sexually transmitted diseases such as 
aids 
at 18 densley is the youngest of the 1274 delegates surveyed 
by the associated press more than 2200 delegates are gathered in 
new orleans for the convention which opens monday 
the proposed plank would reflect a mormon church program known 
as family home evening in which families are encouraged to get 
together on monday nights for various activities including 
religious instruction 
densley conceded that with the bulk of the platform work 
completed his prospects for success are slim densley said he 
didnt think of his profamily plank until after the committee 
began its work last week 
what all of these social moral issues have is a common 
starting point a lack of moral fiber densley said what 
could turn the country around is a stronger emphasis on the 
family 
its not a religious issue per se it could work wonders 
nationally said densley the oldest of six children in a devout 
mormon family that adheres to the family home evening program 
densley graduated from high school only last june and spent the 
summer in political science and prelaw at byu 
he said he ran for a spot in the utah delegation to prove that 
teenagers can play a significant role in politics

president reagan made his entrance at the 
republican national convention sunday riding in a mardis gras style 
parade and pledging every ounce of energy and every fiber of my 
being in support of george bush for president 
the president and his wife nancy rode into the new orleans 
convention center in an open antique touring car preceded by 
marching bands floats and an elephant 
the crowd that jammed the convention center standing on the 
concrete floor to hear the president interrupted his speech with 
frequent cheers and applause 
at the beginning of the speech the president was heckled from 
the back of the hall by a handful of protesters they were evicted 
and their signs were taken down 
reagan spent much of his speech deriding the democrats whom he 
said had become the party of no 
they know what they intend to do once in office the 
president said but they dont want the american people to find 
out until after the election 
the masquerade is over he added its time to talk 
issues to use the dreaded l word to say the policies of our 
opposition and the congressional leadership of his party are 
liberal liberal liberal 
the party of yes has become the party of no said 
reagan who was a democrat until 1962 
four more years four more years the crowd chanted as 
reagan walked onto the stage 
later the republicans chanted bush bush bush as reagan 
got into his speech he paused briefly saying thats right 
thats his name 
at the outset of his speech he made several quips at the 
democrats expense 
reagan said he had something in common with democratic vice 
presidential nominee lloyd bentsen without naming bentsen he 
said neither one of us shares the views of their presidential 
nominee 
reagan also suggested he had something in common with democratic 
nominee michael dukakis whom he referred to only as their 
presidential nominee 
come this january neither one of us will be holding a federal 
office he said 
declaring that we never want to see the day when the supreme 
court is more interested in criminal rights than in the rights of 
the victim and society itself reagan predicted the next 
president may have the opportunity to appoint three and possibly 
four new justices shortly after taking office 
on foreign affairs he said what a great moment we have 
before us and oh how future generations will dishonor us if now in 
a moment of sudden folly we throw it all away 
we must hold to this moment of hope and i tell you with 
every ounce of energy and every fiber of my being only electing 
george bush president of the united states can accomplish that 
my fellow republicans america needs the strength vision and 
true grit of george bush 
the speech was a preview of the one reagan will make in prime 
time on opening night of the gop convention monday 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters on the 
flight from washington aboard air force one that the convention 
speech will focus on successes of the administration including 
the presidents policies on arms control and military strength 
he said it will also contain some reminiscing 
on tuesday morning the president will speak at a closed 
breakfast for big contributors to the republican party 
bush arriving that day to claim the partys nomination will 
cross paths with the president at belle chasse naval air station 
after remarks by both men the reagans will be off to their 
688acre ranch in the santa ynez mountains near santa barbara 
calif where reagan has spent 316 days since becoming president 
reagan has been increasingly active on bushs behalf as the 
convention neared with the vice president still lagging behind 
democratic nominee michael s dukakis in public opinion polls 
on thursday the reagans lunched with bush and his wife 
barbara at the white house and plans for the previously 
unscheduled airport meeting in new orleans were announced 
on friday reagan and bush addressed cabinet members and 
political appointees the president saying frankly i dont 
think the american people want to gamble their future on a blind 
date 
in his weekly radio speech on saturday the president continued 
to hammer at this theme picturing bush as a candidate with a 
proven national record and saying of the democrats while they 
talk we deliver 
this will be reagans seventh republican national convention he 
has attended every one since he switched his registration from 
democratic in 1962 
at the 1964 convention in san francisco he was an alternate 
delegate from california after barry goldwater won the nomination 
reagan campaigned for him with a strongly conservative speech that 
was his introduction to the national political arena 
he first addressed a republican convention in miami beach fla 
in 1968 when richard nixon was nominated when nixon was 
renominated in miami beach four years later reagan presided over 
the convention he has addressed every gop convention since then 
telling delegates in dallas in 1984 that this was the last time 
he would address such a gathering as a candidate

orbiting space debris poses a threat to 
spacecraft and should be eliminated a national aeronautics and 
space administration scientist said sunday 
donald kessler a project scientist at nasas johnson space 
center told an international conference exploring various forms of 
space pollution that a particle could strike and damage a 
spacecraft the debris ranges in size from old nonfunctioning 
satellites and rocket boosters to nuts and bolts from 
disintegrating spacecraft 
kessler estimated that at least 48000 objects one centimeter or 
larger are in orbit about the earth but told a colloquium of the 
international astronomical union that the true number is probably 
much higher 
in june of 1983 a window of the space shuttle challenger was 
replaced after being struck by a piece of orbiting debris that 
caused a small pit later chemical analysis revealed the window 
had been hit by a fleck of paint no larger than one 
eightthousandth of an inch in diameter 
kessler says such collisions involving the space shuttle are 
rare because of the vehicles low orbit and the relatively short 
amount of time the shuttle spends in space longer space missions 
will require additional protection 
the problem gets to be more severe for something like the 
space station which is planned to be continuously there for 30 
years kessler said 
shields are currently being designed to protect the crew from 
debris about one centimeter in diameter the size of a marble 
the shields weigh an extra 2000 pounds per module there are 
six modules so thats an extra 12000 pounds of weight that are 
having to be put into orbit because of the orbital debris 
environment kessler said 
a presidential directive now requires that american spacecraft 
be designed to minimize the creation of space debris future rocket 
boosters said kessler will probably be designed to fall back to 
earth kessler estimated that redesigning boosters might increase 
their cost by 10 to 20 percent 
the us is not alone in recognizing the growing danger of space 
debris kessler said a 1986 explosion of a spent ariane rocket 
booster spewed 400 pieces of debris into orbit an event that 
woke the european space agency up to the problem of orbital 
debris

secret service agents and police combed the 
vast louisiana superdome on sunday to make sure it was safe and 
bombfree before delegates to the republican convention descended 
on the arena 
the secret service would say little about their role at the 
convention except that its agents first priority is to protect 
president reagan and vice president george bush who is to claim 
the gop presidential nomination this week 
its a tremendous task theres a lot involved when you start 
talking about securing places examining sites and allocating 
manpower said rich adams an agency spokesman 
he declined to say how many agents have been assigned to the 
convention 
a major task was completed sunday when the superdome was 
evacuated for 1 hours while agents and police with dogs checked 
for explosives 
adams said part of the arena such as rooms that are not being 
used were checked earlier making the task easier 
secret service agents also will keep an eye on convention 
protests which are being staged six blocks away 
we have to closely monitor them in case they become unruly and 
people start jumping fences adams said referring to a 
5000footlong 8foothigh chainlink fence that was erected 
around the superdome for the convention 
new orleans police lt don bell said work on the fence was 
completed sunday and that a total of 110 officers will work 
eighthour shifts around the clock during the convention 
were basically observers bell said its boring at 
times stressful at times and very interesting weve never had a 
closeup look at a convention like this before 
crowd control is nothing new to the police department which 
must deal with up to 1 million visitors every year during the 
raucous mardi gras celebration 
at the entrances to the superdome police officers and secret 
service agents will be stationed near xray machines and metal 
detectors 
police also will do extra duty to direct traffic and about 110 
state troopers will help patrol the tavern and hotellined streets 
of the french quarter where many of the convention delegates are 
staying

a peace activist broke a 63day 
liquidonly fast one day for each million dollars allegedly spent 
on rambo iii by biting into a giant pizza with a pepperoni 
peace sign and delivering it to sylvester stallones door 
jerry rubin a southern california campaigner against cinema 
violence and war toys didnt see stallone but was more graciously 
received saturday than in a previous visit to a stallone residence 
when someone squirted him with water over a wall 
the actors housekeeper even obliged when rubin needed to do a 
retake of his stunt for tv cameras 
rubins wife marissa and two friends were on hand as the 
activist went to stallones home and with media watching 
presented the pizza to a housekeeper 
when a television crew arrived late rubin went back to the door 
and got his pizza back to reenact the event at one point the 
unwieldy 3footwide pizza slipped off its cardboard platter and 
onto the concrete driveway 
after his first bite in 63 days rubin said he was looking 
forward to watching movies with popcorn again 
one of the placards carried by the group read sly give pizza 
a chance rubin said he hoped his attempt at humor would open a 
line of communication with stallone and other makers of violent 
films 
we need to reach them to open up that dialogue because it has 
gotten out of hand he said in 10 or 20 years from now were 
going to pay a sad price because these films not only have a 
negative effect on children but they have a negative effect on 
everyone

sphinxlike i think is the adjective describing him said 
george w bush a texas delegate to the republican national 
convention 
the vice presidents wife barbara says she doesnt even want

exgov evan mecham declared himself just 
sort of a normal delegate from arizona as he arrived here for the 
republican national convention but the turmoil caused by his 
prolonged recall and impeachment battle still made him the center 
of attention at a sunday reception 
other arizona delegates said they hoped to unify behind george 
bush and forget the partys disarray at home 
state republicans didnt come here to expose the differences 
within the republican party in arizona said state party chairman 
burton kruglick 
this is new orleans this is national said delegate tom 
camp of phoenix weve left anything that pertains to arizona 
back in arizona 
some arizonans suggested mecham who was convicted of high 
crimes and misdemeanors might want to mend fences with his chief 
rival in the state party sen john mccain who called for mechams 
resignation in january a few months ago mecham struck back 
saying mccain lacked honesty and integrity and was not qualified 
for vice presidential consideration 
on sunday however the former governor said he would be in the 
superdome on monday to hear mccains address to the opening night 
session hes getting a good spotlight and im happy for him 
mecham said 
us rep jon kyl who was among the congressmen who sought 
mechams resignation in january but is not a delegate suggested 
some accommodation might be in order for the former governor 
obviously a person who has been as contentious as he has been 
ought to be working to improve his relationships kyl said but 
hes his own man im not going to give him advice 
zane smith who helped lead pat robertsons campaign in arizona 
predicted the state delegation would take a break this week from 
the intraparty battle arizona could play a major part in the 
growing conservative movement he said adding if the infighting 
continues there wont be that opportunity

george bush guarded his vice presidential 
deliberations sunday while one of his prospective running mates 
said he didnt want the job and others acted like they were 
auditioning for it 
bashing democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis was the 
order of the day for sens dan quayle of indiana and bob dole of 
kansas and rep jack kemp of new york all on bushs list of 
potential vice presidents 
sen alan simpson of wyoming a close bush friend who also was 
on the list said i would be a liability and disclosed he had 
asked the gop nomineetobe to drop him from consideration 
but another name popped up again for consideration former 
white house chief of staff howard baker republicans outside of the 
campaign are urging bush to take another look at the former senate 
leader a source said 
bush was at the vice presidential residence in washington and 
keeping his own counsel on his deliberations on a running mate he 
had lunch with treasury secretary james a baker iii who is slated 
to take command of his presidential campaign and worked on his 
acceptance speech 
even top aides who have conferred regularly with bush 
disclaimed any knowledge of whether he was leaning toward one 
prospect or another 
hell probably tell us maybe 10 minutes before you find out 
campaign manager lee atwater told reporters in the superdome where 
the republican national convention will convene on monday 
atwater said there was no change in bushs plan to keep his 
choice a secret until thursday morning the convention will go 
through the formality wednesday night of naming bush the gop 
presidential nominee 
the names mentioned most frequently were dole and his wife 
former transportation secretary elizabeth dole kemp simpson 
quayle attorney general richard thornburgh and sen pete domenici 
of new mexico 
former gov lamar alexander of tennessee also among the 
mentioned was in the convention city for only a few hours to 
address a meeting of gop governors 
asked if he were on bushs list alexander said no ones told 
me if im on anyones list its a list no ones told me about 
he said he has had no communication from bush or his aides about 
the vice presidency 
the doles were guests of honor at a reception and they told 
reporters that bush aides asked both of them last week for 
additional background information 
domenici and quayle late arrivals in new orleans sunday were 
immediately plunged into the runningmate maelstrom 
i really am not out trying to get the job domenici told 
reporters adding he hasnt heard from the bush campaign for 
maybe a week my guess is that im really a long shot still 
theres not a dimes worth of difference philosophically 
among the hopefuls quayle said i think well just enjoy 
ourselves and wait for the big announcement 
thornburgh decided this weekend to come to the convention monday 
to be on hand for president reagans farewell speech that night 
the selection of someone to fill the no 2 spot on the ticket 
was the only suspense at the convention and conservatives were 
actively lobbying to get one of their own in that spot 
sen gordon humphrey of new hampshire appearing on the nbc show 
meet the press said if george bush chooses some 
establishment republican as his running mate we will have 
something much worse than a gender gap we will have a conservative 
gap 
humphrey expressed reservations about simpson and dole and said 
the most acceptable people being talked about were kemp and quayle 
but the new hampshire senator also said that on friday of next 
week when all of this is settled im going to be supporting the 
ticket 
my record is just as conservative as senator humphreys 
said dole when asked about the criticism of his record 
senator humphreys influence is not widespread he added 
conservative opposition to simpson was based on the wyoming 
senators positions on abortion and taxes 
ive had a very checkered career said simpson during an 
interview on meet the press ive punched the lights out of a 
lot of sacred cows i would be a liability for george 
on taxes simpson suggested he believes the next president may 
be forced to ask for a tax increase to deal with the deficit 
good lord somebody is going to have to do something in that 
area or well be off the wall he said 
in separate talk show appearances quayle dole and kemp 
concentrated on criticizing dukakis an activity that would be at 
the top of the agenda for whoever becomes the vice presidential 
nominee 
interviewed from evansville ind on the abc show this week 
with david brinkley quayle said dukakis democratic party 
stands for a party in retreat it stands for a party of doom and 
gloom they dont have an agenda for the future 
as for his own prospects for being on the ticket quayle said 
i would like to believe that i would be acceptable to the whole 
party 
dole said im not running for vice president in a joking 
reference to his wife the senator said im not campaigning for 
anyone but she would be a great addition to the ticket 
dole brushed off his attacks on bush when they were competing 
for the presidential nomination 
obviously in the primaries i was not talking about his 
strengths said the kansan 
thornburgh said it was very flattering to be mentioned but 
i have a job to do for this president reagan and until ive 
heard anything from the vice president im ready to go to work as 
attorney general of the united states thornburgh was sworn in to 
his new post on friday 
craig fuller bushs chief of staff said he will make a good 
attorney general when asked about thornburgh when asked if he 
were saying thornburgh a former governor of pennsylvania was not 
under consideration fuller said i didnt say for how long

inmates angry over heat and crowded 
conditions set fire to a county jail sunday destroying one wing of 
the precivil war building at least eight people were injured 
prisoners at the essex county jail and house of correction 
pelted firefighters and police with cans and debris as flames 
poured through the roof of the jail during the threehour uprising 
two prisoners tried to escape but were caught before leaving the 
grounds authorities said 
cops got hit firefighters got hit lawrence fire lt james 
campbell said they threw pipes long pipes i dont know where 
they got them from bricks bottles 
about 100 prisoners were moved from the destroyed east wing of 
the 144yearold jail to an outdoor recreation area where some 
tried to climb fences before they were contained by a phalanx of 
riot police authorities said tear gas was used to subdue the 
inmates authorities said 
essex county special sheriff harry coppola said 250 inmates were 
being housed at the jail about twice its official capacity the 
jail is not airconditioned and temperatures in the boston area 
sunday climbed into the 90s 
about noon a group of inmates set a small fire in the gymnasium 
that was quickly extinguished 
but about 1 pm a second fire broke out that raged for 1 
hours destroying a shingled roof over the east wing of the 
crossshaped threestory granite building 
at least eight people were injured including five inmates and 
one firefighter who were taken to lawrence general hospital and bon 
secours hospital in methuen authorities said hospital officials 
said they were being treated for smoke inhalation and cuts 
the jail predominantly houses prisoners convicted of 
misdemeanors with maximum terms of up to 2 years officials said 
among the inmates were 31 federal prisoners awaiting trial who are 
kept in the facility under contract with the federal government 
coppola said 
inside the jail yard about 20 inmates many clad only in 
shorts chanted food and unfair treatment to about 500 
spectators who filled a park adjacent to the jail in this city of 
60000 located 30 miles north of boston 
state police trooper charles mcphail said inmate visitation 
rights recently had been revoked because of unspecified problems 
which may also have been a cause for the uprising 
about 300 police and firefighters from at least eight cities and 
towns were called to the disturbance the police entourage numbered 
more than 200 state county and local officers including two 
squads of helmeted riot police authorities said 
during the blaze in the gymnasium which was set with paper and 
other debris inmates watching from their cells pelted firefighters 
with cans and squirted them with shaving cream campbell said 
about 100 firefighters were dispatched to the jail to fight the 
second larger fire riot police were called in after firefighting 
efforts were hampered by the hail of debris and the blaze was 
under control about 230 pm officials said 
about 35 of the jails 127 cells were destroyed and virtually 
all the others suffered smoke and water damage or other damage 
officials said 
michael fair head of the states department of correction said 
his agency was looking for a place to house 110 to 140 inmates 
displaced by the fire the fire certainly puts a tremendous 
strain on an already overcrowded system fair said 
the state is planning a new facility in nearby middleton to 
replace the lawrence jail said state human services secretary 
philip johnston the states top prison official 
the lawrence prison he added is one of the oldest in the 
country and its a very bad facility thats the reason we should 
get this going as quickly as possible 
prison overcrowding has been a chronic problem in massachusetts 
at state and county facilities legislation giving the state 
control of county facilities has been stalled in the state 
legislature for at least two years

sen pete domenici of new mexico shrugging 
off speculation that his stock was rising as a potential 
runningmate for george bush said sunday that he is still a long 
shot 
i really am not out trying to get the job said domenici 
who arrived in the convention city sunday night 
but he made it clear that he would relish the opportunity to run 
against democrats michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen 
im concerned about michael dukakis taking over a country 
thats really on the way to a real recovery from a period of 
enormous stagnation he said 
i know a lot about the american economy and the world economy 
i think i could dispel some of the very strange notions the 
democratic nominee is making about the new era of prosperity he 
might bring 
domenici was asked what his liabilities would be as a vice 
presidential candidate 
im from a very small state we dont have very many electoral 
votes im not very well known ive always thought bob dole was 
the logical vice presidential nominee and hes been through it 
before he said 
but he added i speak a little spanish im ethnic im 
italian im an immigrants son both mother and father born in 
italy i speak that language and i speak spanish those are the 
kinds of things that might give me a chance 
asked if the bush campaign has been in touch with him domenici 
said no i havent heard anything from them for maybe a week i 
heard some of my friends on tv this morning i dont know what that 
means most of them havent heard anything either i think hes 
told us he isnt going to tell anybody anything until wednesday 
my guess is that im really a long shot still domenici said

leaders of two major opposition groups held 
protest rallies on sunday the day before the electoral college 
begins ratifying returns from the bitterly contested july 6 
elections 
manuel j clouthier presidential candidate of the conservative 
national action party claimed there was widespread vote fraud and 
called on president miguel de la madrid to oversee the 
nullification of the july balloting and set new elections for may 
1990 
he made the proposal in a letter to the president and released 
the text at a midday rally at the independence monument clouthier 
then led a march to mexico citys main downtown plaza where police 
estimated the crowd at about 15000 
cuauhtemoc cardenas presidential candidate of the leftist 
national democratic front coalition repeated his demand that the 
federal election commission release a breakdown of votes from 
individual polling stations he spoke at a rally in juchitan in the 
southern state of oaxaca 
last week cardenas filed a criminal complaint against two 
commission officials saying the commission had violated the 
electoral code by failing to release results from 24642 voting 
stations nearly half the national total 
those who form the electoral college must also know that there 
is a people waiting for its resolutions who voted on july 6 
against imposition corruption and violence who voted for 
democracy and for a lawful regime and who will not permit abuses or 
humiliations he said sunday 
the electoral college is to meet through aug 31 and the 
opposition groups are expected to continue their almost daily 
protest rallies 
clouthier in the letter to de la madrid urged the president to 
ask all political parties to participate in a what he called a 
patriotic conciliation and electoral legality pact 
he said participants would instruct their delegates in the 
chamber of deputies to vote to nullify the elections and appoint an 
interim president to take office on dec 1 when de la madrid steps 
down at the end of his sixyear term 
new elections then would be held in may 1990 he said 
it is possible that the presidential election could be 
declared legal but it wont be considered linked to justice by the 
majority of the electorate clouthier said 
demonstrators shouted maquio maquio clouthiers childhood 
nickname and waved the partys blueandwhite flags at the mexico 
city rally some carried papiermache effigies of carlos salinas de 
gortari the candidate of the governing institutional revolutionary 
party 
both the left and right accuse the government and the governing 
party which has held power since 1929 of widespread fraud during 
the balloting and vote tabulations 
official results announced a week after the election gave 
salinas 5036 percent of the vote cardenas 3112 percent and 
clouthier 1707 percent 
the opposition plans demonstrations outside the legislative 
palace when the chamber of deputies serving as the electoral 
college meets on monday 
parties also have called on residents to protest with 15minute 
blackouts at 8 pm every evening while the sessions last the 
college meets through the end of the month to review the results 
and formally declare the winner 
reeling from its smallest margin of victory ever in a 
presidential race along with congressional losses and the 
oppositions refusal to concede the 59yearold governing party 
has pledged reforms and defended the election process 
in these days the confrontations could grow manuel camacho 
solis secretarygeneral of the institutional revolutionary party 
said friday 
in an apparent warning to the opposition he said basic 
agreements among the parties were possible but respect for 
decisions of the federal elections commission and the electoral 
college should be part of any widely accepted agreement 
representatives of the governing party and the two main 
opposition parties have signed a joint declaration saying that 
orderly demonstrations would be allowed and no special security 
would be needed 
the leftleaning newspaper la jornada praised the agreement as 
contributing substantially to resolving what was beginning to 
become a conflict 
the chamber of deputies has 300 seats filled by direct election 
and 200 assigned according to the proportion of the vote received 
on saturday the federal electoral commission assigned the 
proportional seats giving the governing party a total of 247 and 
opposition parties 227 certificates on 13 seats for the 
institutional revolutionary party were withheld pending resolution 
of challenges

in broad daylight and in midmanhattan the 
busiest part of the nations busiest city police say they have 
seen a marked upswing in especially brazen robberies on the crowded 
streets 
we have gangs of people and they swarm like locusts said 
police sgt richard a scantlebury a 23year veteran they will 
come up to a field of wheat which is three tourists and pick 
them dry then the swarm will move along 
one such crime on july 27 made headlines the ashcroft family of 
muncie ind was standing outside st patricks cathedral at 5 
pm when a 22yearold man with a pistol jumped out of a car and 
demanded their video camera the bandit was shot to death when in 
trying to flee he tried to commandeer a car driven by an offduty 
correction officer 
as soon as i heard about that one i thought he must be 
crazy on crack said lt george hall head of the manhattan 
robbery squad the highly addictive form of cocaine is blamed for 
many of the thefts 
the proximity of the martinique hotel one of the citys 
homeless hotels also is a contributing factor within blocks of 
the martinique affluent shoppers browse in macys lord amp taylor 
and other stores 
you have a lot of teenagers with nothing to do with their 
time theyve been plopped into the middle of midtown wealth 
money and they have nothing the sergeant said 
we have more people coming of age robbery is a young crime 
scantlebury said you rarely find a 43yearold doing street 
robberies theyre not as fleet of foot 
each day manhattan offers thieves a potpourri of prey 
thousands of commuters engulf the island to work and shop and 
tourists keep on coming last year 178 million tourists came to 
new york city and the numbers are running about the same for 1988 
according to the convention and visitors bureau 
its like fishing in a stocked lake scantlebury said 
there are more people as a result there are going to be more 
victims and a greater chance of a guy getting away 
robberies in the first three months of 1988 were up more than 13 
percent from 835 in the first quarter of 1987 to 950 in midtown 
south precinct bordered by 29th and 45th streets after a 9 
percent increase in 1987 according to police figures robberies in 
midtown north precinct bordered by 45th and 59th streets are up 
10 percent from 397 in 1987s first quarter to 437 this year 
after a 2 percent decrease last year 
to combat the problem more uniformed police are being deployed 
on foot patrol and when members of the robbery squad are not 
investigating cases they are assigned to keep an eye on the 
streets 
but despite a heavy police presence in the area times square 
is going nuts hall said we go by there late at night we 
shudder when we see these unsuspecting tourists coming out of the 
theatre at 11 12 oclock at night theyre just walking 
statistics 
street thieves sometimes use wheels bicycles are favored 
because they allow a quick getaway even in congested traffic and a 
thief can blend in with the citys ubiquitous bicycle messengers 
theyve become so sophisticated they transport their bikes 
into manhattan in the body of a truck scantlebury said when 
they reach their base usually in lower manhattan they put the 
bikes in the truck and drive away escaping police who are 
looking for suspects on bikes 
then there are thieves who follow victims out of banks and onto 
the crowded streets striking suddenly without a word punching 
them in the face and grabbing their money 
only two of them have been arrested since the ring began its 
operations more than a year ago and prosecution is difficult 
because most victims cant identify their attacker 
for many crimes against tourists punishment is uncertain the 
bad guys know that if you rob a tourist hes not going to be 
around to be a witness scantlebury said

residents of this small farming town and 
beyond crowded sunday into the new our lady of guadalupe church 
built to replace the one destroyed in last years tornado that 
killed 30 people 
bishop raymundo peno dedicated the church as a shrine to the 
virgin of guadalupe the first such shrine in the el paso roman 
catholic diocese 
in the future we hope this will become the center for 
spiritual growth in west texas pena said of the only church in 
the predominantly hispanic town of about 350 people they can 
come for spiritual retreats and for pilgrimages 
the brownandgray brick structure was built on the site of the 
old cinder block church which was leveled during the may 22 1987 
tornado the new building completed in late june boasts 
classrooms a dormitory and kitchen 
the churchs sanctuary is dominated by a blueandorange stained 
glass archway with a statuette of the virgin of guadalupe in the 
center 
the church held a much larger crowd sunday than the sanctuarys 
official capacity of 276 as lay representatives from every parish 
in the vast el paso diocese attended the crowd of about 600 
spilled into the halls and outside as worshipers strained to hear 
its great to have the church back said tomas martinez who 
lives a block west of the building if we had a crowd like this 
every time wed have a pretty good town here 
last years tornado destroyed about 40 houses many of the 30 
people who were killed were attending a preschool graduation 
ceremony at a community center when the twister hit the structure 
with little warning 
gabriel candelas who grew up across the street from the church 
said he rushed to saragosa from his home in el paso when he heard 
about the twister he arrived about 3 am eight hours after the 
tornado he said 
it was unrecognizable completely different he said i 
couldnt find my parents house 
a little over a year later the red cross texas department of 
community affairs and the catholic church have rebuilt every 
house a new community center with a 300person capacity tornado 
shelter is a block from the church 
its definitely had an impact on the people tension 
stress candelas said some people are very moody because they 
lost all they had and their loved ones but its getting better

more than 1000 activists insisted sunday 
that blacks will not be slaves to a political party and cheered 
the reagan record on minority appointments but they conceded 
concern about holding a republican national convention with 92 
percent white participants 
we want to be critical without being antagonistic said 
clarence smith chairman of the equal employment opportunity 
commission the party has to do more than just sit back 
passively 
thats what the republican party has to do open up its 
doors echoed george smith a delegate from san diego the 
party has to have more blacks at all levels at all echelons 
a group called the council of minority americans held the 
dinnerreception to focus on the blacks hispanics and other 
minorities named to positions in the federal government organizers 
insisted that republicans have a strong record to sell to minority 
voters and said democrats are taking their votes for granted 
you saw the democratic party make a statement that the black 
vote is simply there said bill wilson a spokesman for the group 
this is not just a onenight arrangement this is designed to 
be the kickoff of an ongoing effort wilson said you cant get 
any economic clout if you cant get a job 
the event came on the eve of a gop convention overwhelmingly 
dominated by whites with fewer than 8 percent of the delegates 
coming from minorities according to an associated press survey 
that rankled many attending but they insisted the best way to 
resolve the disparity was to work within the party 
this is designed to let the convention know there are 
minorities who do support the ticket said lawrence king an 
omaha neb businessman who organized the council 
questioned about the tiny number of blacks and other minorities 
represented on the convention floor king said i think thats 
basically the way things are there are not a lot of black 
republicans 
others argued that george bush the certain nominee has a 
strong record on civil rights issues and will lure black voters 
we have perhaps a republican presidential nominee with the 
greatest commitment to civil rights since richard nixon said dan 
smith an alternate from los angeles thats not to say there has 
been enough progress by my reckoning it ought to be 10 percent or 
12 percent

a carriage horse was temporarily overcome by 
heat sunday and a running club changed its plans for a race for the 
first time in its history as the worst heat wave in decades 
continued to wrack the city 
it hit 96 degrees at 4 pm the 31st day this summer that the 
temperature exceeded 90 degrees the record of 37 days was set in 
1944 
consolidated edison also reported a record for sunday 
electricity demand 7645 megawatts between 9 pm and 10 pm 
breaking the record of 6770 megawatts set last sunday spokesman 
marty gitten said peak demand often occurs at that hour as people 
return home from weekend activities and turn on air conditioners 
and lights 
a horse put to work pulling a carriage across the sizzling 
streets collapsed of apparent heat prostration but apparently 
suffered no lasting effects the authorities said 
the horse collapsed on a street on manhattans east side shortly 
after noon it lay for about 90 minutes before regaining enough 
strength to get into a trailer to be taken to its stable nearby 
said william kapps chief lawenforcement officer of the american 
society for the prevention of cruelty to animals 
horsedrawn sightseeing carriages are banned from city streets 
when the temperature tops 90 degrees the temperature in central 
park hit 90 at noon the weather service said it had not been 
determined if the carriage driver would be ticketed kapps said 
for the first time in its 30year history the new york road 
runners club changed a road race through central park to a 
noncompetitive fun run because of the oppressive temperatures 
said fred lebow president of the club 
when we announced the decision to run it as a fun run it 
was soundly booed he said however by the finish of the 
31mile run many of the more than 1000 participants applauded 
his judgment he said 
the decision was prompted in part by the deaths of two young men 
who collapsed and died after running separate 3mile races in 
sweltering heat earlier in the summer lebow said officials said 
the two men who were participating in corporate team competitions 
were not in proper shape to be running 
none of the runners in sundays event suffered any ill effects 
from the heat and humidity lebow and the citys emergency medical 
service said 
new york city has been roasting for six weeks enduring what 
fred gadomski a meteorologist at pennsylvania state university 
called the worst heat wave since the mid1950s

feminists and a kissin at which protesters surrounded roman 
catholic archbishop philip n hannan and shouted complaints about

the big easys officers just stood back and watched 
thats what we are here easy going said officer j parker

with the legend era yes in white on green a childrens 
advocacy group tossed fortune cookies the slips inside read the 
children of today are the leaders of tomorrow 
speakers exhorted the crowd to political action 
we are here to tell the world that the republican party has 
turned its back on womens rights said molly yard president of 
the national organization for women but this does not let the 
democrats off the hook they will at their peril ignore womens 
issues 
she told the group to keep an eye on what the republicans and 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis and others in his

thirtyfive dehydrated salvadorans were 
found locked inside a sweltering boxcar sunday during temperatures 
well over 100 degrees authorities said 
us border patrol officials found 20 more illegal aliens 
outside the locked boxcar but aboard the same freight train bound 
for houston about 1030 am said border patrol agent cruz mcguire 
it was well over 100 degrees when we found them border 
patrol agent ramiro gonzalez told the corpus christi callertimes 
it was probably another 20 to 30 degrees hotter inside the car 
the salvadorans including three women and two 14yearold boys 
had been locked inside the car since they boarded the train five 
hours earlier in brownsville gonzalez said some were trying to 
get air through holes in the boxcar he said 
when we opened the car up the people were pale and real 
sweaty and then we transported them to the border patrol station 
in kingsville and gave them water and we fed them gonzalez said 
if the border patrol had not intervened the salvadorans could 
have suffered the same fate as 18 aliens found dead last summer 
locked inside a boxcar near the west texas town of sierra blanca 
the train had traveled about 25 miles north from brownsville 
which is the southernmost city in texas and borders matamoros 
mexico when harlingen border patrol agents noticed aliens aboard 
some riding on grain hoppers the agents then followed the train 
through isolated ranch land to kingsville about 100 miles north of 
brownsville 
officials checked the train car by car at the kingsville freight 
yard until an agent heard voices inside an insulated boxcar 
gonzalez said the aliens inside told agents that the door was to 
have been kept open to allow ventilation but either the smuggler 
or a train station employee in brownsville closed and locked the 
door gonzalez said 
authorities did not know the identity of the smuggler whom the 
aliens said they paid 300 to 600 gonzalez said 
the 35 salvadorans were detained on immigration charges and 
faced deportation along with a honduran man and 19 mexican 
nationals authorities said

florida citrus merchandisers always 
protective of their highquality product are taking action to warn 
confused consumers they may be spending too much for dilutedjuice 
beverages 
deceptive labeling can cost consumers millions of dollars each 
year says robert behr economic research director for the 
florida department of citrus 
industry leaders are also asking the federal food and drug 
administration to implement rather than revoke a regulation 
requiring fruit and vegetable juice products to be clearly labeled 
to show the percentage of juice 
besides concern that consumers are confusing diluted products 
for real orange and grapefruit juice industry officials are 
reacting to growing competition from other juices and juicebased 
drinks 
for instance high prices and a poor consumer image have caused 
a precipitous decline in sales of 100percent grapefruit juice over 
the past decade orange juice too has lost some of its market 
share to apple juice and others plus the soft drinks that contain 
small amounts of fruit juices 
along with its modest consumerawareness campaign the citrus 
department is distributing new grapefruit juice television 
commercials a departure from recent years when such advertising 
was limited to newspapers and magazines 
in the past 100 percentpure grapefruit juice has been 
primarily advertised as a healthy wholesome product says 
department publicist cathy clay 
in addition to that we are now showing in the tv 
commercials that it is more refreshing invigorating uplifting 
she said 
the departments citrus marketing director william p gordon 
calls the 43 million 23week run of tv commercials beginning in 
midseptember a new approach to grapefruit juice advertising 
to increase topofmind awareness and meet the growing competition 
from other juices or juicebased beverages 
a recent study done for the citrus department showed that 40 
percent of the consumers questioned believed that a diluted 
grapefruit beverage was 100 percent pure juice 
the product advertised as a grapefruit cocktail contained less 
than 50 percent grapefruit juice and its label did not show that 
if only one person out of 10 mistakenly believes a certain 
product contains pure juice consumers could be overspending from 
50 million to 90 million a year depending on the amount of juice 
in that beverage behr said 
in some cases the consumers are actually paying more for a 
product that is not 100 percent juice even though that is what 
they believe they are getting he said 
few of the dilutedjuice beverages on grocery shelves have the 
juice content on their labels department officials say despite an 
fda regulation requiring such information 
the fruit and vegetable juice labeling rule has been on the 
fdas books for several years but it has never been implemented 
said the departments general counsel kristen chadwell 
and because of pressure from some industry groups the fda has 
declared its intent to revoke the rule ms chadwell said 
we of course have since sent them our objections to the 
revocation and provided them with our research results she said 
the fda is expected to decide which way to go by the end of the 
year 
the proliferation of juicebased drinks blends cocktails 
beverages and other variations with or without proper labeling 
information has stirred some consumer groups into action 
the ralph nader center for science in the public interest has 
called on the fda to crack down on manufacturers who do not list 
the percentage of juice contained in the products and the fda has 
been looking into false or misleading labels on some of the diluted 
beverages 
the fda does require that products sold as orange juice carry 
labels declaring the exact percentage of juice they contain 
florida industry people would like the same rule to apply to 
grapefruit juice eliminating at least that problem for the 
confused consumer

the united states should abandon farm price 
supports and production controls to capitalize on a growing demand 
by poorer nations for food an economics professor says 
us policy not only distorts us production away from its 
comparative advantage but contributes to the distortion of 
production decisions around the world said john m antle an 
associate professor of farm economics at the university of montana 
consequently the us share in commodity trade declines and 
the united states fails to exploit its comparative advantage he 
said 
antle released a study that predicts developed countries 
including some in east asia and latin america will be shipping 
more food to poor ones in coming years 
the fouryear study world agricultural development and the 
future of us agriculture was sponsored by the conservative 
american enterprise institute 
the report does not take into account the current drought in 
this country and others and its effect on reducing world food 
reserves 
eastern asia and latin america are likely to continue to 
experience high rates of growth in food production and 
subsaharan africa can be expected to continue to face stagnation 
and even reductions in food production and real income antle 
said 
the effect of these trends will be to increase further the 
trade in agricultural commodities especially cereals between 
developed and developing countries his report said 
the study predicted increased grain production in the united 
states and canada until at least the year 2000 the increase is 
greater than projected for 12 european nations that compete with 
the us but less than the projected increase for the soviet union 
and other communistruled countries in asia and latin america 
antle also predicted surpluses of millions of tons of major food 
crops in china east asia and southeast asia in the year 2000 
compared with deficits in 1980 but he forecasts continued or 
larger shortfalls for other parts of the third world 
antle also said some countries will remain poor even if they use 
their meager resources efficiently especially semiarid tropical 
regions in south central india northern and subsahara africa and 
parts of latin america 
most poorer countries will find it hard to increase their 
imports as singapore taiwan and south korea have done he said 
those three are small homogeneous and densely populated with low 
transport costs access to shipping lanes and have been able to 
make investments in human capital and institutions he said 
the future of chinas potential for increased supply and demand 
depends on its governments decisions antle added 
what does seem fairly certain is that east asia and the 
middleincome countries of latin america are particularly well 
positioned to take advantage of new technologies and new market 
opportunities he said

broadcasters are being urged to restrict the 
airing of sexually explicit material while the federal 
communications commission studies new guidelines to shield children 
from indecent programs 
i would tell broadcasters they need to be cautious said 
jeff baumann general counsel for the national association of 
broadcasters 
the fcc is under orders from a federal appeals court to review 
the agencys rules governing sexually explicit material on 
nighttime television and radio the inquiry is due to begin shortly 
and take several months before new rules are adopted said diane 
killory fcc general counsel 
in the meantime it is unclear at what times in the evening 
indecent programs can be aired without fear that unsupervised 
children will be listening or watching 
the appeals court ruling suspended a 2000 fine the fcc levied 
early this year against kzkctv kansas city for airing the movie 
private lessons during prime time in may 1987 the action had 
been the first against a broadcaster since the fcc toughened its 
decency standards in april 1987 
the july 29 court decision could affect discussions by house and 
senate conferees who will consider an amendment to a budget bill 
sponsored by sen jesse helms rnc to prohibit stations from 
airing indecent material at any time 
congressional sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
despite indications the measure would be struck down in court 
chances were good that an electionyear congress would pass a ban 
on broadcast indecency 
courts have ruled that indecent but not obscene material is 
protected by the first amendment though childrens access to it 
may be regulated 
the july 29 ruling affirmed the fccs definition of indecency 
adopted from a supreme court ruling language that depicts or 
describes in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary 
community standards for the broadcast medium sexual or excretory 
activities or organs 
obscenity is defined similarly except that it also appeals to 
the prurient interest and lacks serious scientific literary 
artistic or political value 
the threejudge panel had trouble with the fccs policy of 
restricting indecent programming to between midnight and 6 am 
the time the agency determined that children were not likely to be 
in the audience 
the court said the fcc had not adequately thought through 
the time restrictions and must try to devise a rule that will 
promote parental as distinguished from government control 
the court upheld an fcc warning issued against disc jockey 
howard stern for portions of his show that aired between 6 am and 
10 am the fcc reads that part of the decision to permit continued 
enforcement of its decency rules during the daytime killory said 
but after that it seems questionable whether the court would 
let us enforce the indecency rule during an evening broadcast until 
we have concluded our inquiry and set a specific time in the 
evening killory said 
the court didnt say when daytime ends or evening begins 
she said 
it is possible the fcc wont conclude the inquiry and approve 
new rules before the end of the year she said in that case the 
matter might be handled by a commission shaped by a new 
administration

in beds of damp compost a web resembling 
angel hair forms tiny stems push out of the mulch and almost 
overnight swell into firm white mushrooms at one of the nations 
largest mushroom farms 
there are no caves or fields just 85 acres of sophisticated 
mushroom production under the roof at princeton farms in a rural 
section of bureau county 
this farm and a sister facility in zellwood fla both owned by 
lyon foods market about 32 million pounds of fresh mushrooms a 
year said princeton manager ralph scott 
its a blending of science and art scott said mushrooms 
are growing organisms and you have to handle them very carefully 
one popular mushroom misconception is that the sublime fungus 
grows only in the dark and with little attention he said 
production rooms at princeton are brightly lit and the annual 
payroll for the laborintensive business is 6 million 
the key to mushroom production is rich black soil blended from 
decomposed straw manure protein and peat moss 
each week 35 tractortrailer trucks arrive at the farm with 
straw shoveled out of horse stalls at chicagos racetracks steam 
rises from the long narrow piles as the pungent material 
decomposes producing temperatures of 160 degrees within the 
compost 
our success is here good compost makes good mushrooms 
scott said 
the straw is pasturized and protein from soybean peanut or 
cottonseed meal is blended into the compost to provide nutrients 
for the mushrooms 
the seed for the crop is mushroom spawn which is growing on 
millet or rye when it is purchased it is added to the straw and 
covered with peat moss and limestone 
the entire mixture is held in fourbysixfoot trays each eight 
inches tall 
the trays are stacked to the ceilings in 45 rooms that resemble 
huge walkin refrigerators temperature and humidity are carefully 
controlled at a cost of about 1 million a year said scott 
the spawn grow a web of fine white roots from which the 
mushrooms sprout workers gently spray them to maintain moisture 
it is just light watering like rain cascading onto the 
mushrooms not like putting two fingers over the hose nozzle and 
flooding it scott said 
it takes about 36 days for the crop to reach the harvest stage 
and picking is done over the course of a month 
about half the farms 425 employees are pickers many from 
mexico and asia and they gather 380000 pounds of mushrooms a 
week 
they climb up the trays pluck the biggest mushrooms from the 
mulch trim off the bottoms of the stems and place many of them 
directly into clear plastic baskets for supermarket display the 
less handling the less damage to the delicate mushrooms 
larger baskets are used for customers like restaurant operators 
lower quality mushrooms are sent to canning companies 
the harvest lands in customers hands within 24 hours said 
scott a 15year veteran of the mushroom business in addition to 
white and brown mushrooms princeton also distributes some 
specialty mushrooms like shiitake 
like any crop there are threats to the mushrooms a type of fly 
will eat the spawn too much water will cause discoloration a 
virus can wipe out production scott said technicians from the 
inhouse laboratory monitor 140 variables that can affect the 
harvest 
but improved varieties and growing techniques mean us mushroom 
growers now produce 650 million pounds a year scott said

a ratification vote was scheduled monday 
for 1700 hospital workers on strike against eight private 
hospitals after negotiators reached a tentative agreement on a 
contract over the weekend 
if ratified the agreement for local 250 of the hospital and 
health care workers union could lead to a return of hospital 
technicians licensed vocational nurses orderlies and food service 
employees back to work 
however the union on strike since july 26 would then have to 
decide whether to cross the picket lines of 2000 nurses on strike 
since aug 2 at six of the medical centers 
union trustee mark splain said there is a provision in the 
tentative agreement that local 250 members would not go back to 
work until the nurses strike is settled it was unclear whether 
the provision would be strictly enforced particularly if the 
california nurses association strike is not quickly settled 
the dispute between the service workers union and affiliated 
hospitals had centered on health benefits and sick leave granted 
employees 
we do think its a fair contract splain said compromises 
were made on both sides and it does restore the basic cuts in 
benefits that we were fighting for i think the membership will 
ratify the contract 
according to a local 250 statement issued saturday the proposed 
twoyear contract grants wage increases of 3 percent for each of 
the next two years for licensed vocational nurses and socalled 
second wagetier employees 
technicians will get a 165 percent raise this year and 3 
percent next year some other job classifications will receive a 
onetime bonus of between 200 and 300 
most importantly the union said workers will not have to pay 
part of the cost of medical insurance unless they choose to see 
doctors not involved in the affiliated hospitals health 
maintenance organization 
the nurses union is fighting for pay increases and improved 
staffing conditions cna representatives have said bargaining 
between the hospitals and striking nurses would quickly follow any 
settlement with the service workers union
