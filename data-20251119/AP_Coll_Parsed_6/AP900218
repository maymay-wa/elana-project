president mengistu haile mariam 
pledged a fight to the bitter end to defend the northern red 
sea port of massawa now under attack by eritrean rebels 
he said in a broadcast to armed forces and police on saturday 
night that losing massawa would lead to the fall of the 2nd army 
and secession of eritrea ethiopias northernmost province 
the fall of the 2nd army would be a heavy blow to the 
ethiopian armed forces endanger the unity and territorial 
integrity of the nation and facilitate the secession of eritrea 
the marxist president said 
it was his first comment on the fighting which began feb 8 
with the first offensive in more than a year by the eritrean 
peoples liberation front 
the eritreans claimed the capture of massawa two days later one 
of ethiopias two ports and gateway to trade involving eritrea and 
its southern neighbor tigre 
the rebels said they killed or captured about 12600 soldiers 
and sank or captured nearly half the ethiopian navy fleet of two 
frigates and 12 patrol craft as listed by the londonbased 
international institute for strategic studies 
the eritreans also said they controlled the 40milelong road 
from massawa to eritreas capital asmara 
mengistu did not directly deny the rebel claim they had captured 
massawa he appeared to rule out any negotiations with the eritrean 
rebels however 
the battle between us and the eplf will be final and 
decisive mengistu said using the acronym for the rebel groups 
name 
we will either win the battle which has been declared against 
us and destroy a coordinated conspiracy against the nation or a 
new group will emerge in the region which would opt for a peaceful 
solution to the crisis 
the latest fighting halted relief operations mengistu said most 
of the 90000 tons of emergency food at the port was destroyed by 
artillery fire 
it was part of 11 million tons of emergency food the united 
nations hoped to deliver through massawa in the next few months to 
feed an estimated 4 million people threatened with famine mostly 
in eritrea and tigre 
mengistu made no reference to government troop casualties or 
massawas 19400 civilian population the ethiopian news agency 
said thursday civilians had been caught in ferocious 
housetohouse fighting it said the port was bombarded from sea 
and land 
on saturday the eritreans claimed in a clandestine broadcast 
the ethiopian air force had intermittently bombed massawa since 
the fighting began 
the rebels alleged the air force also dropped chemical bombs 
killing civilians 
since fighting began independent verficiation of rival claims 
has not been possible both sides however normally report only 
victories and each others alleged atrocities 
the eritreans took up arms in 1962 to press for eritreas 
independence peace talks failed late last year

a christian scientist couple who 
tried to heal their ailing 15monthold child through prayers have 
been acquitted on charges of involuntary manslaughter and child 
endangerment 
los angeles county superior court judge robert thomas ruled 
friday that there was insufficient evidence to convict eliot and 
lise glaser on the charges filed in the death of their son seth 
the toddler died march 28 1984 of meningitis following a 
twoday illness 
under state law parents are required to provide basic 
necessities for their children including food clothing and 
medical care a 1976 law sponsored by the christian science church 
however exempts parents who treat children through prayer alone 
the glasers had sought protection from prosecution under that 
provision arguing they had taken their child to a christian 
science healer 
the issue was appealed to the california supreme court which 
ruled that the exemption applies only to the felony charge of 
failure to provide basic necessities and didnt offer immunity 
from prosecution on other charges 
if christian scientists or any other religion eschews medical 
treatment in favor of prayer after their child exhibits symptoms 
that are critical to their health they have a legal obligation to 
take that person to a physician said the prosecutor deputy 
district attorney david wells 
following the appeal both sides in the case agreed to let 
thomas decide the glasers fate based on the transcripts of their 
1985 preliminary hearing 
the court record included the glasers version of what happened 
as well as the testimony of two doctors who said the child could 
have been saved if his parents had brought him to a hospital 
the courts decision turned on evidence that the child showed 
brief bursts of recovery during predominant periods of high fever 
vomiting and discoloration wells said 
the judge ruled that the periodic points of promise raised in 
his mind a reasonable doubt as to whether the religious healing was 
a wanton and grossly negligent act wells said

rj reynolds tobacco co confirmed saturday 
it plans to test market a new cigarette named dakota but said the 
campaign would be aimed at adults who are currently smokers of 
marlboros 
it is intended to appeal to that large group of adults both 
male and female who are currently smoking marlboro the largest 
selling brand said james w johnston chairman and chief 
executive officer 
the washington post reported in saturday editions that a 
proposed marketing plan prepared for reynolds by promotional 
marketing inc suggests dakota be positioned to replace marlboro as 
the brand of choice among female smokers with limited educations 
and between the ages of 18 and 24 
secretary of health and human services louis w sullivan 
reacting to the report said in a statement 
smoking is increasingly becoming concentrated among americans 
with lower incomes and less education and this is simply wrong 
it is especially reprehensible to lure young people into 
smoking and potential lifelong nicotine addiction and the risk 
that smoking specifically poses for women adds yet another tawdry 
dimension to any cigarette marketing effort which may be aimed at 
younger women 
he noted that lung cancer has overtaken breast cancer as the 
number one cause of death among women and said smoking poses 
special risks for pregnant women 
women who are 18 to 20 years old represent the only group of 
americans whose rate of smoking continues to increase 
sullivan said he would present more detail about smoking 
problems at a hearing tuesday before the senate labor and human 
resources committee 
the post said the marketing plan proposed for dakota set for a 
test in houston in april targets women whose favorite pastimes 
include cruising partying and attending hot rod shows and 
tractor pulls with their boy friends 
it said documents it obtained showed the marketing plan is aimed 
at young white women with no education beyond high school who are 
described as virile females 
the proposed campaign called project vf for virile 
female described the type of woman targeted as one who watches 
roseanne and evening soap operas on television and who hopes to 
get married in her early 20s and spend her free time with her 
boyfriend doing whatever he is doing according to the report 
the post said it was not clear whether rj reynolds has adopted 
the marketing strategy proposed to it by promotional marketing inc 
johnston said in a statement released by reynolds that the 
dakota marketing plan is focused on current adult marlboro smokers 
nothing more nothing less 
the marketing plans for dakota represent an implementation of 
reynolds objective or regaining market share lost over the past 
several years to our competitors he said this focus on 
competitive brands is no different than that of every other 
cigarette company or indeed any other consumer product company 
different products are designed to appeal to different categories 
of consumers he said dakota is no different 
meanwhile kathleen wiebers executive director of the south 
dakota lung association noted that the state has the fifthlowest 
smoking rate in the nation at 211 percent of the adult population 
according to the federal morbidity and mortality weekly report 
that means that 80 percent of south dakotans are nonsmokers 
and were pretty proud of that wiebers said 
reacting to the reported marketing plan for dakota she said 
its very upsetting that a tobacco company would think todays 
women are that naive how dumb do they think we are 
valerie lawruklvich a bartender at shooters in eugene oregon 
said the dakota name had a certain appeal calling it a cool 
breezish type thing 
but she said getting her to change brands probably would require 
more than just a name at a discounted price to start with she 
said you know buy one pack get another one free something 
like that tshirt giveaways are a big item ive bought certain 
cigarettes just for the tshirt this previous year you know if 
they had like a really neat packaging type thing a catchy name 
would also help 
donna allgood interviewed by telephone at the whiskey junction 
bar in minneapolis minn said i dont think dakota is a real 
good name for a womans cigarette at least personally speaking i 
think when you start with a d word that duh thats too harsh 
it should be something softer 
at the american legion hall in marysville tenn sherrie 
meisamer told a telephone interviewer she thinks the market 
campaign as it was related to her was very disgusting 
theyre trying to introduce younger age groups into the 
smoking sensation she said i dont think thats quite right 
myself theyre young people automatically going to buy because 
theyll put on a big display for it im a smoker i have been for 
several years i dont take it as a personal affront but i dont 
think its very agreeable that they should try to overdramatize the 
younger crowd

major news media declared that the governing 
conservative party would hold its majority in the lower house of 
parliament based on computer projections from sundays national 
election 
if final returns bore out the projections issued less then four 
hours after the polls closed the liberal democratic party could 
claim it had been pardoned for a widespread influencebuying 
scandal that cut into its popularity and played a part in two prime 
ministers resigning last year 
kyodo news service and nhk the publicsupported japan 
broadcasting corp said their computer projections showed the 
governing party keeping its majority 
liberal democratic leaders also declared they believed the party 
would hold its majority though final official returns were not 
expected until monday afternoon 
party secretarygeneral ichiro ozawa told reporters he believed 
the party would hold at least a bare majority of 257 seats in the 
512seat lower house which has power to name the prime minister 
and pass the budget without assent of the upper house 
another party official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
he was confident of reaching 265 seats and hoped for 270 to give a 
vote of confidence to prime minister toshiki kaifu and enough power 
to deal with the opposition which controls the upper house the 
party currently holds 295 seats 
i was concerned that the party would barely win a majority 
and internal struggle would hinder the partys ability to bargain 
with the opposition the official said 
early unofficial returns showed the liberal democrats who have 
held power since 1955 when the party was formed losing some of 
their seats but holding a lead over the combined opposition 
ozawa said it was clear that four of the partys incumbents had 
lost in farm constituencies in northern japan 
of course we wanted to defend our dominance in those 
constituencies but under the severe situation we have to accept 
defeats the no 2 party figure told reporters at party election 
headquarters 
about 71 percent of the 905 million eligible voters a high 
turnout identical to that in the 1986 election cast ballots at 
more than 50000 polling stations nationwide 
forecasts by nhk based on early partial counts said the 
governing liberal democrats held 185 seats and the combined 
opposition 147 shortly after 10 pm four hours after the polls 
closed 
kaifu head of the liberal democrats and socialist chairwoman 
takako doi who could become japans first woman prime minister if 
the opposition scores an upset victory each said they believed 
their sides would win

population experts alarmed by the lack of 
response to birth control programs are urging the government to 
pass a law limiting families to four children an independent 
newspaper reported sunday 
the nigerian guardian said official projections based on an 
estimated national average of every woman bearing seven children 
indicate it will take at least 20 years before any population 
policy makes an impact on the nations 34 percent growth rate 
nigerias population of 115 million is the largest in africa and 
one of the fastest growing in the world officials project that it 
could reach 165 million within a decade 
the nations population is difficult to control because the 
momentum for the present growth rate is already established the 
newspaper quoted dr ab sulaiman as saying 
sulaiman the architect of nigerias birth control program and 
executive director of its planned parenthood federation said he 
believed there was a national desire to reduce population growth 
but doubted it could succeed while at least 50 percent of the 
population is young and sexually active 
worried population experts have sent a report to the government 
urging enactment of a law to force people to limit their families 
to four children the newspaper reported without identifying the 
experts 
it said they urged the government to abandon its sensitivity to 
cultural issues that frown on birth control and to concentrate on 
freeing the next generation from poverty hunger disease social 
disorder mass suicides and other byproducts of overpopulation 
traditions and polygamy tolerated culturally and by the moslem 
religion of many nigerians encourage large families they are 
considered a sign of a mans wealth and virility and also provide 
free labor for family holdings in the agriculturebased countryside 
birth control now can prevent the situation from getting worse 
for the next generation and ensure that youth embrace family 
planning as a social ethic so that past mistakes are not 
perpetuated sulaiman said 
but he concluded that only wars earthquakes floods famine 
epidemics and other disasters could reduce the population or stall 
its frightening growth rate before the year 2010

environmental and industry groups are on 
opposite sides of a dispute over whether to break up the nations 
largest appeals court which exercises authority across nine states 
and far into the pacific 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals with jurisdiction over 
more than 40 million americans from its base in san francisco is 
frequently the arbiter of major environmental cases 
this huge circuit requires too much travel and has too many 
judges handing down too many opinions that breed inconsistency and 
lack of uniformity says sen slade gorton rwash 
joined by eight other senators gorton is proposing to cut the 
9th circuit into two parts and establish a new appeals circuit 
based in seattle 
the timber industry supports gortons plan while 
environmentalists wince at the notion of taking jurisdiction over 
major lawsuits out of california and moving it to timber country 
similarly pacific northwest senators find themselves at odds 
with californians 
the real criticism of the bill supporters is aimed at the 
outcome of some of the environmental litigation and what the bill 
sponsors would do is a backdoor way of influencing these 
decisions says nan aron head of the alliance for justice a 
courtwatching group based in the nations capital 
courtroom dueling between timber companies and environmentalists 
has focused on the northern spotted owl the 2pound bird nests 
exclusively in the douglas fir trees of old growth forests in 
the pacific northwest 
environmentalists say more cutting could threaten the spotted 
owl to say nothing of the forests themselves with extinction 
portland ore attorney mark rutzick an outspoken advocate of 
the timber industry says creating a seattlebased appeals court 
would result in decisions based on a sounder understanding of the 
circumstances 
theres a world of difference between the california life 
experience and life in a small timberdependent community in 
oregon or washington he says availability of trees for a 
sawmill to process is life or death for a small town 
such views have caused environmental groups including the sierra 
club and the national wildlife federation to head in an opposite 
direction 
vic sher a sierra club legal defense fund attorney based in 
seattle takes issue with the notion that federal courts of 
appeals should be bastions of provincialism 
one of the reasons for having the court of appeals is to 
insure the removal of the court from the immediate concerns of the 
community he says 
but he doubted that merely moving appeals of environmental cases 
northward would automatically change the outcome we bring good 
cases he said we assume the court will continue to decide on 
the law 
sen pete wilson rcalif however said in a dec 5 letter to 
national wildlife federation chief jay d hair that he believes the 
outcome of cases could change under the proposed new system 
this legislation is not in the best interests of judicial 
administration and it could also undercut the effectiveness of 
important decisions protecting the environment in the western 
united states wilson said 
aides to sen alan cranston dcalif say he plans to be on 
hand march 6 to oppose the bill at a hearing before a senate 
judiciary committee panel headed by sen howell heflin dala 
gortons bill would leave arizona california and nevada in 
smaller 9th circuit it would create a new 12th circuit with 
jurisdiction over alaska idaho hawaii montana oregon and 
washington as well as guam and the northern marianas thousands of 
miles away in the pacific 
with california senators opposed efforts to restructure the 
court are likely to face tough sledding this year 
bill proponents argue that the size of the 9th circuit requires 
too much travel on the part of lawyers critics counter that court 
papers may be filed locally in all the states in the circuit and 
they say there would be little difference between traveling to san 
francisco or seattle for lawyers from montana or alaska 
proponents also say that because of the courts size it is 
inefficient critics say it already has divided itself into two 
administrative units and now is a model of efficiency 
bill opponents note that the circuits active judges are 
unanimous in opposing the bill supporters point to other judges 
who favor it 
timber lobbyists meanwhile say they have not been active in 
pushing for the legislation they do make clear however that the 
industry is smiling on the idea 
it seems to us says william murray american forest 
resource alliance counsel that certainly senator gorton and the 
other senators have identified legitimate concerns with regard to 
judicial administration in the 9th circuit which i think has been 
regarded for some time as being overlarge and overworked

the government sunday grounded all 13 
airbus320s operating with stateowned indian airlines pending an 
investigation into a crash last week that killed 91 people news 
reports said 
the 150seat plane the only passenger aircraft with fully 
computerized flight control capabilities will be grounded until 
all aspects of its operation are investigated the united news of 
india said citing unidentified officials 
the news agency said pilots had criticized the use of the plane 
by indian airlines because its sophisticated technology required 
commensurate ground maintenance which was not available in india 
on wednesday a 3monthold airbus320 crashed while it was 
coming in to land at bangalore airport killing 91 of the 146 
people on board 
indian airlines which flies to 73 cities in india and nine 
nearby countries placed an order for 31 airbus320s last year it 
has received 14 of the planes each costing 38 million 
the cause of wednesdays crash remained a mystery the weather 
was clear and the pilot had not reported any emergency 
the aircraft on a scheduled flight from bombay grazed a clump 
of trees short of the runway crashed and caught fire newspapers 
have said the pilot tried to manually take over the planes 
computer control minutes before the landing 
an indian airlines spokesman said newspaper reports were 
incorrect and that nothing could be said until inquiries were 
completed 
both the pilot and the copilot died in the crash and the 
inquiry is centering on the cockpit voice recorder and fight data 
recorder 
the crash was only the second involving the airbus320 which is 
manufactured by airbus industrie a european consortium based in 
toulouse france in the previous crash at an air show in eastern 
france in june 1988 three people were killed and 50 were injured 
in that accident the company blamed pilot error before 
investigations were completed the pilot michel asseline told 
investigators that the engines responded late to efforts to gain 
altitude 
but airbus industrie denied there were any problems with the 
plane and the french government suspended asselines pilots 
license for eight years 
the twinengined narrowbodied jet consumes 40 percent less 
fuel than similar planes and has been making inroads into the 
mediumrange market long dominated by boeing and mcdonnell 
douglas airbus industrie says it is the fastest selling plane in 
aircraft history

rightwing russian nationalists staged a venomous 
rally sunday to complain about president mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms warming ussoviet relations and the growing nationalism 
in nonrussian republics 
the 2000 people gathered in the deep snow near soviet tvs 
1600foottall transmission tower also heard speakers accuse 
gorbachev of being powerhungry and plunging the soviet union into 
poverty and misery 
ironically the rightwing groups were taking advantage of 
gorbachevs glasnost policy of greater openness to counter liberal 
measures they believe are hurting the russians the countrys 
dominant ethnic population 
the harshest attack on gorbachev came from boris unko of the 
united front of workers of russia a group fighting gorbachevs 
marketoriented economic reforms and unhappy about the nationalism 
in nonrussian republics 
unko told the crowd that the people initially supported 
perestroika gorbachevs reform program but that today we see 
what we got from that 
among the evils wrought by gorbachevs reforms unko said were 
rock music modernism and pornography insults to heroes of 
the bolshevik revolution and world war ii and others who built 
socialist society he said gorbachev had sold out to the elite 
and forgotten about the working class 
today we very much want to understand is that a result of 
some kind of mistake or unfortunate circumstances unko demanded 
he said gorbachev is trying to become a dictator adding that 
the soviet leader should have known his reforms would bring more 
harm than good 
any grandmother could have predicted the consequences of such 
a course but you keep different company the elite 
propertyholders you make friends with presidentmurderer bush 
also a fighter for democracy who spilled blood in muchsuffering 
panama unko said 
although ethnic russians including gorbachev dominate the 
soviet leadership russian nationalists feel forsaken by the 
kremlin and its economic and political liberalization and adhere to 
orthodox socialism 
russians also feel threatened by other nationalities who have 
been speaking out against what they see as imperialistic policies 
that have encroached on local languages and cultures and plundered 
natural resources 
sundays rally reflected the increasing polarization that has 
occurred as the soviet unions more than 100 ethnic groups vent 
long pentup grievances russian nationalists have become 
particularly vocal during the campaign for march 4 elections to the 
republics legislature 
small knots of people huddled at the demonstration to talk 
politics and buy leaflets and newspapers published by russian 
nationalist groups 
one written statement described a purported plot to seize power 
being hatched by liberal parliamentarians in the interregional 
group whose leaders included russian populist boris n yeltsin 
the statement signed by a patriotic group called russia 
said the coup would occur in the second half of march and that the 
instigators were hording hundreds of train wagons of consumer goods 
for distribution after they take power 
banners resting against a fence attacked gorbachev they read 
mikhail is the creator of vileness and desolation and 
gorbachev answer for the breakdown of the economy 
one banner held by protesters blasted gorbachevs proposal made 
at a meeting of the communist party central committee two weeks 
ago to strengthen the presidency a post he now holds 
no fascism under the guise of a presidency the poster read 
a candidate in the march 4 elections alexander i dorpayev 
accused economic reformers of purposely leading the economy to 
collapse so they could impose capitalism to benefit underground 
millionaires 
speakers obliquely criticized soviet jews who emigrate and one 
woman held a poster attacking jews

unlike us elections with their mechanized and 
curtained booths in japan its all done by hand at rows of tables 
with only a hint of privacy 
as a result many a ballot was cast in sundays parliamentary 
elections after furtive glances at neighbors or the outright 
comparing of notes 
a young couple standing sidebyside at desks separated only by 
low partitions in one suburban polling center discussed the merits 
of each candidate in their district before agreeing on a mutually 
acceptable member of the opposition socialist party 
an elderly woman nearby filled in a ballot for her husband who 
was cradling their grandson 
voters outside gathered for one final look at photographs of the 
candidates on campaign posters which had to conform to government 
size regulations to be pasted on the centers official billboard 
one housewife said she went to the center undecided but chose a 
liberal democrat after examining his poster 
he looked the most respectable of the bunch she said 
the election for the 512 seats in the powerful lower house of 
japans bicameral parliament was seen as a crucial test of whether 
scandals and unpopular policies would end the liberal democrats 
more than three decades of control over the government 
more than 90 million people age 20 or older were eligible to 
vote and officials said about 73 percent cast ballots those 
unable to pencil in their vote on the light green ballots because 
of physical disability illiteracy or other reason were able to 
designate proxies to vote for them 
the counting of the votes began immediately after most centers 
closed at 6 pm and the first assured winner based on 
computer projections was declared just 90 minutes later on publicly 
supported television 
but difficulties were expected in counting the handwritten 
votes which could be nullified for misspellings or unnecessary 
markings and because voters have been known to write only the 
family name of their chosen candidate problems also were expected 
in one district where three satos were in the running and in 
another that had three kogas 
in a separate ballot sunday a national referendum was held on 
the performance of eight of japans 15 supreme court judges the 
eight took their seats after the last such poll during elections 
for both houses of parliament in 1986 
spaces were provided for voters to mark if they thought any of 
the cabinetappointed justices should be removed 
the system was written into the constitution by usled 
occupation forces after world war ii to provide a safeguard against 
unpopular appointees but it has been criticized as ineffective 
no justice has resigned because of a poor rating and critics 
say many voters do not know the backgrounds of the judges they are 
rating well enough to render a fair decision 
that charge was reflected by the young wife at the suburban 
polling center who held out her ballot to her husband and asked 
do you know any of these people

horror stories abound about the federal agency 
everyone loves to hate the internal revenue service 
one of the earliest dates to 1925 when the nations chief 
taxcollection agency then the bureau of internal revenue and 
its parent treasury department responded to a senators allegations 
of widespread corruption by slapping him with a 108 million bill 
for back taxes 
there is considerable evidence that the irs sometimes has been 
used against political enemies especially during the franklin d 
roosevelt kennedy johnson and nixon administrations just last 
year a congressional subcommittee held hearings on allegations of 
outright fraud and bribery involving senior irs officials 
then there are the almostcomical examples of a bumbling 
bureaucracy the wrongful seizure of childrens bank accounts and 
the expenditure of huge amounts of time and money to recover a few 
dollars in back taxes 
these and other stories are recounted by david burnham in a 
law unto itself power politics and the irs 
with its sprawling bureaucracy of 125000 employees an 
unpopular task and a seeming susceptibility to shooting itself in 
the foot the irs is an easy target 
but burnham rejects the excuse that there are bound to be 
occasional foulups in any organization so big 
the rapid turnover at the very top of the irs the recruitment 
of most of its top administrators from within and the almost 
complete lack of outside review make the agency astonishingly 
consistent in the often erratic and hardnosed way it deals with 
the american people burnham writes 
only two irs officials the commissioner and the chief counsel 
are appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate 
burnham notes and since world war ii the average tenure of the 
commissioner has been 37 months stepping into that leadership 
vacuum he contends is a small unknown cadre of senior civil 
servants who have spent their entire careers slowly inching up the 
agencys promotion ladder 
for the most part burnham says these career officials are 
conservatives with a suspicious almost paranoid mindset all 
too often he adds the agencys power is brought to bear against 
those whose chief crime is that they offend the sensibilities of 
an agency bureaucrat 
burnham blames congress for many irs problems he says the house 
and senate shirk their responsibility to oversee the irs for fear 
that a crackdown could deter collection of the taxes that finance 
the programs that lawmakers love 
the irs is hampered by an organizational structure and an 
outmoded computer system that were dictated by congress to disperse 
the agencys authority in the wake of a major 1950s scandal and 
watergate abuses 
a former new york times reporter burnham blames the news media 
for failing to cover the irs as thoroughly as it does say the 
justice department and he criticizes academics for showing far 
more interest in the tax laws than how they are administered 
burnham acknowledges that the irs does its basic job well 
collecting 90 cents of every tax dollar owed about 1 trillion a 
year except for writing that he talked to dozens of irs employees 
whose integrity seemed beyond question he has little else that is 
good to say about the agency 
even the praise for workers integrity is tempered by a note 
that many expressed such despair about the ability of the agency 
to function in a fair way that their will to perform a decent days 
work appeared to have been seriously undermined 
the irs has declined to comment on the book but even as the 
book was making its appearance the irs was acknowledging publicly 
that we have made mistakes and we have identified systemic 
weaknesses and areas that can and should be improved 
irs commissioner fred t goldberg jr made those statements in a 
report on how the agency is responding to allegations including 
some made by burnham and others by investigators for a house 
subcommittee about ethical lapses among some senior officials 
if most americans are unaware of some of the problems of the 
irs they probably are familiar with what burnham views as a root 
cause 
in a situation where both the enforcers and the subjects of 
enforcement are unable to fathom the intent of the law burnham 
writes arbitrary and capricious actions are inevitable 
it is hard to imagine how reforms can be made within the 
administrative process until congress and the public understand 
that the agencys genuine flaws begin with truly impossible tax 
laws he concludes

this years winner of the 10th annual 
strange music festival was a hosaphone runnerup honors went to a 
harp that came from from the broad side of a barn third place went 
to the humongaphonium 
the festival began in 1980 at carter caves state resort park and 
was intended originally to celebrate the jaw harp but we decided 
that was too limited so the thing just started getting a whole lot 
bigger said festival cofounder dick albin a nashville tenn 
humorist 
albin said the festival has attracted musicians from japan 
israel canada and west virginia previous winners include a babys 
bottom and a dogs tail 
this brings out latent musical abilities said john p 
tierney park naturalist and the other cofounder 
more than 100 people squeezed into the meeting room at the park 
lodge to watch six musicians demonstrate their creations prizes 
went to the instruments that were the most unusual and the best 
able to play a recognizable tune 
dick mansfield a folk musician from mansfield ohio won what 
he called a hosaphone he took the mouthpiece from a trumpet and 
stuck it into a hose from his mothers washing machine twirling 
one end of the hose he played taps 
i came up with this 30 years ago but never had a place to play 
it mansfield said 
robert toothman of south point ohio came in second with his 
board harp a 5foot4 piece of lumber from the side of an old barn 
that he fitted with frets and banjo strings 
thirdplace went to jc ramey of olive hill a former 
elementary school principal who said he spent a year developing his 
entry which he called a gigantic compressedair pvc 
humongaphonium 
it was a long piece of plastic pipe with a slide in one end and 
an air compressor on the other with the help of two assistants he 
played the ol gray mare 
tierney said this years entries werent as strange as some hed 
seen 
we had a very bizarre instrument a while back he said 
this couple had a baby and they figured out that if they patted 
him hed gurgle so they played that 
another contestant tied a stick to a dogs wagging tail so the 
animal could play the drums visually it was strange tierney 
said but musically it was lacking something

campus said lee a 1979 morehouse graduate we were told that 
this whole color thing was irrelevant now in atlanta theres a

woman 
lee referred to tracy lynn morrow who sued her former employer 
the internal revenue service claiming her supervisor a 
darkskinned black fired her unfairly the case is pending

peggy say paid tribute sunday to plo 
chairman yasser arafat for his efforts in trying to free the 18 
western hostages in lebanon including her brother the 
longestheld of the captives 
in an hourlong meeting saturday the leader of the palestine 
liberation organization told mrs say that he was doing his very 
best to win the release of the hostages but did not go into 
details 
i was pleased to meet him after waiting such a long time to 
come face to face with him mrs say told the associated press 
i was encouraged that he said he would do his very best which is 
all i could ask of anybody 
mrs say is the sister of terry anderson the chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press kidnapped in beirut on 
march 16 1985 and believed held by shiite moslem extremists with 
close ties to iran 
i am sure arafat will do whatever he can if he should find 
himself in a position to do something mrs say said 
unfortunately he has no direct influence on the kidnappers but 
he is a player in the middle east and its my job to approach 
anyone who might help 
mrs say is on a humanitarian pilgrimage to gather 
international support for the release of anderson and the other 
hostages thus far she has met un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar pope john paul ii and leading officials of the european 
parliament in strasbourg france 
mrs say is accompanied on her tour by don mell the ap 
photographer who was with anderson when he was abducted and larry 
heinzerling a deputy director of the ap which supports mrs says 
efforts financially and logistically in pressing its own efforts to 
win andersons release 
a group calling itself islamic jihad or islamic holy war is 
believed to be holding anderson and terry waite special envoy of 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie who disappeared jan 20 
1987 while trying to negotiate the release of the hostages 
arafat received mrs say during a luncheon with a group of 
friends and supporters in his luxurious wellguarded mansion 
overlooking the mediterranean in suburban gammarth 
the palestinian leader invited mrs say to sit next to him at 
the long table and showed her the arab fashion of eating roast lamb 
with his fingers 
i liked him personally mrs say declared he was very 
charming and sympathetic particularly in listening to my problems 
which may seem small when compared with the many problems he must 
have to contend with himself 
mrs say leaves monday for paris where she will meet unesco 
director general federico mayor later heading to damascus for a 
meeting with syrian foreign minister farouk alsharaa and then 
canterbury england to meet runcie 
what is discouraging is that ive been making this trek for 
five years now mrs say said and i never met anyone who said 
he could solve it it is always a complicated circuit through a 
series of other people 
arafat told her the man with the greatest possible influence 
would be president hashemi rafsanjani of iran but that his room 
for maneuvering is limited by hardliners in his government 
mrs say said she still hoped to get permission to visit iran 
although her many visa applications have gone unanswered 
in all eight americans four britons two west germans two 
swiss an italian and an irishman are believed held captive

moments after the curtain fell on his 
performance in a verdi opera at the kennedy center soviet tenor 
vladimir popov played the leading role in an emotional backstage 
drama when he received his us citizenship papers from supreme 
court justice antonin scalia 
this is the greatest day in my life declared popov who 
fell to his knees crossed himself and grinned broadly im a 
little bit nervous 
popov 42 the son of a retired soviet army general defected in 
1982 in milan italy while on leave from the bolshoi opera to 
study italian repertoire at la scala he sought asylum at the us 
consulate in milan wearing only a tshirt and a pair of jeans 
on saturday night popov sang with prima donna aprile millo in 
the washington operas first production of the giuseppe verdi 
spectacular aida before a soldout audience in the kennedy 
center opera house 
after taking his bows at the footlights popov joined his 
americanborn wife lucy backstage for a joyful celebration with a 
small circle of friends and wellwishers 
still wearing the heavy makeup and glittering robes of the 
operas egyptian war hero radames the stocky tenor was greeted by 
a blackrobed scalia the son of a sicilian immigrant and a 
selfconfessed opera lover 
i am delighted to welcome you to the land of the free and the 
home of the brave said scalia who gave the singer his 
citizenship papers encased in a redframed album with vladimir 
popov printed in gold letters on the black leather cover 
the reason you gave for coming to america was that you wanted 
a choice said scalia the choice to be the person you want to 
be and to perfect all your abilities 
popov beamed sighed and responded to the applause in russian 
style by applauding back later at a blacktie cast party popov 
wore an american flag pin on his tuxedo lapel as washington opera 
general director martin feinstein hailed our newest american 
citizen and a wonderful human being 
popov interrupted rehearsals for aida on friday to fly to 
snowbound new hampshire to take his oath as a naturalized citizen 
from a federal judge in concord after reciting the pledge of 
allegiance popov turned to his wife and said now ive got my 
second voice i can vote now 
mrs popov the daughter of ukrainian immigrants said her 
husband plans to cast his first vote on march 13 in municipal 
elections in their hometown of wentworth nh her brother vitaly 
is a candidate for selectman on the local town council 
in an interview earlier in the week popov said he defected 
because of the suffocating bureaucracy and limited repertoire of 
the bolshoi opera where talented young singers were suppressed in 
favor of a clique of aging stars chosen by seniority 
my progress was so slow he said in halting english i 
sing a little bit here and a little bit there but they always say 
this is not your time or no you only learn one opera in two 
years 
it was a matter of having choices he says in the soviet 
union you have no choices you are told what to sing when and 
where to sing it here we have choices thats really the number 
one reason 
his life has changed quickly since he defected in milan on april 
29 1982 his 35th birthday he arrived in new york two days 
later he soon met lucy his volunteer interpreter and married her 
a few months later he auditioned for the washington opera on their 
honeymoon and made his debut with the metropolitan opera in new 
york in 1984 
this year popov has been signed to sing in 30 operas concerts 
and recitals across the country and abroad including la scala this 
summer the opening of the vienna state operas 199091 season next 
fall and a return engagement at the met next winter 
when hes not touring popov enjoys crosscountry skiing and 
boating on his 32acre farm in the new hampshire mountains or 
sipping a beer while watching charles bronson and arnold 
schwarzenegger action videos at home hes a couch potato his 
wife says 
popov said he was cursed as a traitor by communist party bosses 
and his defection was bitterly opposed by his military father 
for the first year or more i had bad dreams every night that 
they would come and take me away popov said 
but he says hes never had any regrets right now i have a 
different life he says laughing what could i do in russia 
now drink vodka maybe

after two weeks of testimony 
prosecutors plan to wind up the case against joseph hazelwood by 
offering a few more pieces of the exxon valdez puzzle and some 
expert witnesses to put it all together 
navigation experts are expected to testify as well as those who 
have studied the effects of alcohol over long periods 
coast guardsmen who went aboard the crippled vessel in the hours 
after it hit a jagged reef are likely to provide accounts of the 
final hours in hazelwoods ordeal at sea 
the 987foot tanker he commanded one of the newest and most 
advanced in exxons fleet of oil cargo carriers grounded on bligh 
reef in the early morning hours of march 24 the holes gashed in 
its giant tanks caused the nations worst oil spill a gusher of 
1092 million gallons of oil spurting into the crystal waters of 
prince william sound 
countless birds fish and wildlife perished and hundreds of 
miles of rocky shore was blackened 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is charged with felony 
criminal mischief and three misdemeanors reckless endangerment 
negligent discharge of oil and operating a vessel while 
intoxicated if convicted he could face a maximum of 7 years in 
prison and 61000 in fines 
at his trial a procession of 23 prosecution witnesses have 
given accounts of the disaster and its possible causes testimony 
has focused on hazelwoods alleged intoxication and his behavior as 
commander of the ship 
key points of inquiry have been 
was hazelwood drunk crew members say he neither slurred nor 
staggered and was cool and calm in the wake of the accident but 
blood and urine tests taken nearly 10 hours after the accident 
showed alcohol in his system and he was seen drinking in a valdez 
bar earlier in the day 
did hazelwood act recklessly when he left the bridge of his 
ship in the hands of the third mate and a helmsman during a tricky 
maneuver past ice witnesses say hazelwood knew the helmsman needed 
close supervision even when doing simple tasks the veteran third 
mate gregory cousins said he agreed to take charge of the ship 
while hazelwood went below for a few minutes 
was hazelwood trying to steer his ship off the reef after the 
accident witnesses have said that backing the tanker off the reef 
might have caused it to capsize adding loss of life to the 
tragedy but hazelwoods lawyers say he never reversed gears and 
ultimately stabilized the ship on the reef in a tape played for 
jurors the skipper tells the coast guard we are working our way 
off the reef 
did hazelwood endanger the crew by not sounding a general 
alarm or abandoning ship after the grounding the prosecution says 
he should have awakened everyone and possibly gotten them into 
lifboats the chief mate testified that hazelwood acted prudently 
and would have taken greater risks putting people into the choppy 
waters of prince william sound in the middle of the night 
experts in maritime affairs may give their opinions of 
hazelwoods decisions and specialists in the study of alcoholism 
will give opinions on whether he was intoxicated 
the range of experts who may testify was indicated friday when 
assistant district attorney brent cole disclosed he had discovered 
some new witnesses he wanted to call the defense protested it was 
too late to come up with new experts and the judge said he might 
not grant permission for their appearance but took the matter under 
consideration 
the experts are said to be able to determine from taperecorded 
voices whether a person is drunk they would be asked to analyze 
the tapes played for jurors of hazelwoods conversations with coast 
guard monitors moments after his ship ran onto the reef 
the skipper spoke slowly and in a deep gravelly voice as he 
announced the disaster saying weve fetched up hard aground 
evidently leaking some oil were going to be here for a while 
was that his normal voice crew members said that was how he 
spoke all the time and certainly how he sounded earlier in the day 
prosecutors are trying to prove that he sounded intoxicated 
the trial was in recess for the presidents day holiday and was 
to resume tuesday

the faithful and the curious came out to 
watch a 69yearold musher cross the finish line of the 540mile 
race to the sky a sled dog run that had beaten him on four 
previous tries 
david armstrong was the last of the finishers saturday but he 
finished seven others of the 15 starters already had dropped out 
i do it because i still can armstrong said in lincoln the 
last checkpoint before the finish line and until saturday the 
farthest he had gone in the race and as long as i can i guess i 
will 
led by 10 sled dogs and cheered on by scores of supporters 
armstrong of helena crossed the finish line to officially place 
eighth alaskan dean osmar shattered the course record thursday 
winning in 120 hours 9 minutes 
armstrong who began racing sled dogs in new hampshire in 1937 
and helped establish longdistance racing in montana was 
officially clocked at 164 hours and 39 minutes to conclude the race 
at dog creek near the continential divide west of helena 
the 5th annual race began south of helena a week before 
retracing most of the same ground 
while saturdays final chapter took place in dog creek the 
story began to unfold 89 miles away in lincoln where armstrong 
realized he was going to be able to finish his first 500mile dog 
race 
its become more of an emotional thing armstrong said 
the feeling is totally different i guess its because weve 
never finished before 
its a little bit of stubbornness in me but overall id say 
its a culmination of five tries 
i guess i was optimistic about finally making it he said 
it means a lot i have three dogs that have raced with me all 
five years its just a team effort

prime minister toshiki kaifu is youthful eloquent 
and witty although untainted by recent political scandals he has 
little power base of his own in the governing liberal democratic 
party 
in short he is everything that party power brokers were looking 
for last august after the liberal democrats lost their majority in 
parliaments upper house and scandals forced two prime ministers 
from office 
kaifu who reportedly owns thousands of polkadot neckties is a 
member of the smallest faction in the governing party his 
elevation to prime minister last year at age 58 fulfilled a 
prophecy he made 29 years earlier at the age of 29 not 
surprisingly he regards 29 as his lucky number 
other political seers however forecast a short stay for the 
confident politician from aichi prefecture in central japan about 
170 miles west of tokyo 
the opposition quickly branded him a puppet of former prime 
minister noboru takeshita who was forced to resign last year after 
charges he had received more than 1 million in donations and loans 
from the recruit co the company at the center of a massive 
scandal that plagued japanese politics for much of the past year 
political analysts predicted kaifu would remain in power just 
long enough for the liberal democrats to regroup and cleanse their 
scandaltainted image 
that fate may still await him powerful men like former foreign 
minister shintaro abe who was reelected sunday despite ties to 
the recruit scandal reportedly aspire to replace him 
while kaifu was in eastern europe in january abe overshadowed 
him by leading a delegation to the soviet union to meet president 
mikhail s gorbachev and kaifu reportedly has been excluded from 
recent key party decisions including the timing of sundays 
election 
but while kaifu has not pursued an independent line or made much 
concrete progress in promised party reforms he has proven a 
credible and attractive leader to the public 
kaifu a former education minister was first elected to 
parliament at the age of 29 when he was sent to the house of 
representatives by the third district of aichi prefecture 
he became a protege of the late prime minister takeo miki a 
reformer who led the party out of a lockheed payoff scandal in the 
mid1970s mikis faction evolved into the present komoto faction 
to which kaifu belongs 
a graduate of waseda university the alma mater of many liberal 
democratic politicians kaifu was a member of the debate club 
kaifu has two children and until he became prime minister 
regularly jogged in the morning with his wife

improving energy efficiency using todays 
technology can solve the global warming problem at a profit of a 
trillion dollars a year a study says 
a push for energy efficiency would reduce the use of coal and 
other fossil fuels that is raising carbon dioxide levels in the 
atmosphere said the studys author amory lovins of the rocky 
mountain institute in snowmass colo 
why fiddle while coal burns we ought to get on with it 
lovins said sunday at the annual meeting of the american 
association for the advancement of science the trillion dollars 
that could be saved each year is equal to the global military 
budget lovins said 
saving energy is far more profitable than building new power 
plants he said indeed energy efficiency is so profitable that it 
ought to be encouraged even if there were no threat of global 
warming from the increased atmospheric carbon dioxide he said 
it doesnt matter how the scientific evidence is shaking out 
on the severity of global warming because we ought to do the 
same thing anyway lovins said 
lovins is an economist and consultant who has been arguing since 
the mid1970s for greater energy efficiency 
he has been criticized by the utility industry and others who 
say that energy efficiency of the degree that he is calling for 
cannot be practically achieved 
lovins has worked hard to support the argument that very large 
improvements in energy efficiency can be made using current 
technology 
he cited a study last year by the swedish state power board 
which found that over the next 20 years sweden could expand its 
economy by 50 percent reduce carbon dioxide output by onethird 
and lower utility bills all through the use of increased energy 
efficiency 
that includes the votermandated elimination by 2010 of nuclear 
power which currently supplies half of swedens electricity 
in the united states lovins has calculated that onefourth of 
us electricity output could be saved with more efficient 
lighting onefourth with efficient motors and onefourth in 
appliances and other equipment 
one problem is that there is no agency to review and redesign a 
manufacturers use of motors for example the technology exists 
but the infrastructure to make it available doesnt lovins said 
furthermore utility planners policymakers and politicians are 
not aware of the potential for savings he said 
lovins and his colleagues have done a study to show the promise 
of savings using currently available energysaving technology 
they found that a world of 8 billion people with an economy five 
times the size of the current one could be supported with only 
onethird of the energy used today 
energy policy built on efficiency would enable the earth to 
support a prosperous civilization that was not plagued by acid 
rain global warming urban smog nuclear proliferation and 
deforestation the study concluded 
among the schemes lovins has devised are programs in which fees 
and rebates are used to promote efficiency 
for example fees for hooking up new buildings to utility lines 
could be raised for buildings that use energy inefficiently and 
rebates could be given to energyefficient buildings 
the same kind of sliding scale could be used for cars with fees 
charged for gasguzzlers and rebates offered for energyefficient 
vehicles

renegade gen michel aouns army from a helicopter base sunday 
after it fell to the rival lebanese forces militia 
the evacuation was possible after aoun and rival christian 
warlord samir geagea called a ceasefire saturday night to halt 
their murderous struggle for control of lebanons christian enclave 
police said 30 combatants were killed and 42 wounded in the 
fighting that preceded the fall of the adma helicopter base to 
geageas lebanese forces militia the base was aouns only major 
foothold in kesrouan province a geagea stronghold 
with admas fall geagea now controls nearly twothirds of the 
christian enclave plus all its ports 
aoun has no harbor equipped to receive ships and is expected to 
demand the withdrawal of the lebanese forces from beiruts port as 
a condition for a durable peace 
otherwise the ceasefire will be short said a police 
spokesman 
aouns command reported the deaths of 10 soldiers in combat

sunday he would support something analogous to the death 
penalty for highlevel bankers who launder drug money 
bennett has said he supports the death penalty for convicted 
drug kingpins and in an appearance on nbctvs meet the press 
program he said bankers who knowingly handle drug cash should be 
treated similarly 
if were talking about capital punishment for people who are 
highlevel drug dealers we ought to be talking about something 
analogous for the highlevel banker who trades in drug cash he 
said 
president bushs proposed drug control strategy calls for 
expanding the circumstances under which convicted drug kingpins 
could face the death penalty 
bennetts comment came during questioning about a case in which 
the luxembourgbased bank of credit and commerce international 
pleaded guilty in january to cocainerelated moneylaundering 
charges and agreed to forfeit 14 million and to help prosecutors 
who say the case has ties to deposed panamanian leader gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
bennett indicated he was concerned that the sentence was light 
and said he raised that concern with bush and he agreed 
but asked whether he was troubled that the bank was still in 
business he said not until the storys over i want to see 
where the investigation comes out 
he said the case is part of an ongoing investigation and that he 
and other officials will continue to monitor it 
bennett also said he hopes for greater military cooperation 
between the united states and south americas cocaineproducing 
countries to stop the flow of illegal drugs 
will there be cooperation between colombia and the united 
states other countries and the united states involving military 
cooperation he said i think there will be 
he added i would not be surprised if in the future we have 
discussions with president barco of colombia and other presidents 
about the ways in which us military intelligence can be 
useful to them 
they asked for our help last year and if they ask for our 
help again well be interested in providing it he said 
the united states has been providing aid to colombia peru and 
bolivia to help those countries cut off drug production and stop 
trafficking to the united states 
bush at the drug summit in cartagena colombia last week 
signed a communique with barco and the presidents of peru and 
bolivia that rules out the use of us military forces in those 
countries but encourages cooperation and intelligencesharing 
the united states also agreed to provide increased equipment and

for a guy holding a lowranking state 
office texas agriculture commissioner jim hightower enjoys a high 
profile 
democrats put him on their national convention podium president 
bushs son endorsed one of his republican rivals gop lawmakers 
tried to abolish his job the texas farm bureau tried and failed to 
get texas rangers pitcher nolan ryan to run as a republican against 
him then sponsored six farmers to challenge him in the democratic 
primary march 13 
hes even been blamed for the coming invasion of killer bees 
through it all hightower has kept his trademark sense of humor 
theres an old east texas saying that a lie is halfway around 
the world before the truth can get its boots on were getting our 
boots on early because theyre going to be telling a lot of lies 
he said 
after reports of an apparently bogus news release being 
circulated that blamed hightower for failing to stop killer bees 
moving north from central america he quipped im going to have 
to start wearing pest strip on my lapel as i go around just to get 
through this election 
other criticism has been more serious 
republicans and conservative democrats have accused the 
selfproclaimed populist of using the agriculture job to promote 
his own political future rather than the work of texas farmers and 
ranchers 
the dallas morning news said last week that 6600 in 
contributions were made to hightowers campaign by seed and grain 
dealers after they were visited by an agriculture department 
employee who was accompanied by a consultant soliciting for the 
campaign 
hightower denies knowing about the solicitations 
adopting the nickname whole hog hightower was elected in 
1982 he quickly became a democratic spokesman against president 
reagans farm policies with such lines as reagans idea of a 
good farm program is hee haw 
he was one of the few white politicians to back jesse jacksons 
1988 presidential bid and talked of challenging republican us 
sen phil gramm this year 
instead he opted to seek a third fouryear term saying he 
wants to keep pushing innovative economic development efforts that 
include alternative crops and direct marketing 
his department has encouraged farmers to plant everything from 
christmas trees to wine grapes it started a taste of texas 
national promotion to help small producers sell everything from 
smoked sausage to hot sauce it helped panhandle grain farmers 
start a flour mill 
its a philosophy of economic development at the grassroots 
level he said weve been able to turn loose the enterprise 
of really thousands of texas producers in a way that demonstrates 
that this new agricultural model actually works 
but he made enemies too 
when the us department of agriculture balked over european 
demands for beef free of artificial growth hormones hightower 
moved to establish a state program to certify such meat that 
brought cries from the white house and the texas farm bureau which 
charged that he was giving credibility to what they consider false 
fears about hormones and making traditional ranchers look bad 
hightowers aggressive stance on pesticide regulation won praise 
from farm workers it also brought efforts to turn his elected job 
into an appointive one conservative legislators lost that battle 
but they did create a new pesticide regulation board on which 
hightower is but one member of nine 
looking for a big name to go against hightower republicans 
urged former dallas cowboys running back walt garrison to run the 
farm bureau sought ryan neither took up the challenge 
when republican state rep rick perry entered the race 
hightower replied i thought they were talking about gaylord 
perry the retired pitcher 
other republican hopefuls are gene duke a cotton seed 
businessman and consultant richard mciver 
all six democratic primary challengers are farmers or ranchers 
who paid their 3000 filing fees with contributions from the farm 
bureaus political arm they are neal burnett dan pustejovsky dan 
krenek john earl smith paul mcdaniel and clyde chandler 
the incumbent commissioner has no practical farming or 
ranching experience said farm bureau official vernie glasson 
as we see it today it is an anybody but the incumbent campaign 
antelope meat and christmas trees are well and good said 
chandler but while you spend all your money time and energy on 
these small insignificant amount of crops the mainstream 
agriculture is suffering 
texas farmers and ranchers deserve to have one of their own as 
agriculture commissioner said perry a former democrat who 
expects to raise 2 million to 3 million for the race 
hightower spent an inordinate amount of time in 1987 and 1988 
outside texas campaigning for jesse jackson and mike dukakis and 
preparing to run himself against sen phil gramm those were not 
the activities texans had in mind for their agriculture 
commissioner perry said 
hightower says the race is a referendum on the departments 
future 
weve carved out a pretty clear identity i think in the 
public mind he said basically all ive heard from the folks 
who are running against me is that im a friend of jane fonda

ariel sharon leader of the farright wing of 
the likud bloc resigned from the cabinet sunday and said he would 
campaign to topple prime minister yitzhak shamir and replace the 
government peace plan with his own 
sharon said he decided to resign because he felt the 
governments plan made too many concessions to the arabs and could 
lead to war 
the plan by itself is a mistake it will not bring us peace 
but will lead to more tension and more bloodshed and maybe even to 
a war which all of us would like to prevent sharon said 
the 62yearold conservative who as defense minister 
masterminded israels 1982 lebanon invasion is shamirs chief 
rival in the rightwing likud bloc 
he has repeatedly argued that shamirs plan which calls for 
palestinian elections and negotiations on a limited autonomy in the 
occupied lands could bring the plo into the peace process he 
fears it could lead to israels relinquishing the west bank and 
gaza strip captured during the 1967 middle east war 
sharon the trade minister first announced his resignation at a 
tumultuous likud meeting last week he made it official at the 
weekly cabinet session sunday by law the resignation is effective 
after 48 hours 
sharon still retains his key post of chairing likuds ruling 
central committee he said he plans to take his campaign to the 
people to win support 
asked if he would challenge shamirs leadership of the likud 
sharon said the answer is yes 
likud shares power with the centerleft labor party which 
favors compromise and giving up some land for peace 
in 1984 sharon challenged shamir for the leadership of likud 
following the resignation of menachem begin he told reporters he 
then received 42 percent of the vote polls taken before last 
weeks likud meeting showed shamir ahead by 63 percent to 78 
percent 
speaking to reporters in his jerusalem office after resigning 
sharon said he would fight to replace shamirs plan which was 
ratified by the cabinet last may with one of his own 
he said his plan would involve opening the border with jordan 
and creating housing projects for palestinian refugees in the 
occupied territories to reduce tensions 
the former general also said that the arab uprising in the 
territories now in its 27th month would have to be crushed before 
peace talks can begin 
in the latest fatality of the uprising a 17year old 
palestinian girl was fatally wounded sunday during a stonethrowing 
clash with soldiers and israeli settlers in the west bank city of 
nablus arab reporters said 
the army confirmed the death of the girl sawsan shahshir and 
said it was investigating 
sharon a famous army commander still respected by many 
israelis has served in israeli governments since 1977 
as agriculture minister sharon led a controversial campaign to 
build jewish settlements in the west bank and gaza the settlements 
are often cited by the united states as an obstacle to peace 
in 1981 sharon was appointed defense minister and directed the 
1982 lebanon invasion that led to an unpopular threeyear 
occupation 
he was forced to resign as defense minister in 1983 when an 
israeli inquiry found him indirectly responsible for the massacre 
of hundreds of palestinians by israels lebanese militia allies in 
beiruts refugee camps 
but he stayed in the cabinet as a minister without portfolio and 
has served as trade minister and a member of the decisionmaking 
inner cabinet since 1984 
also sunday israeli troops shot and wounded 10 palestinians in 
a stonethrowing clash in the gaza strip town of rafah arab 
reports said 
the bodies of two palestinian men were found near nablus but 
the motives behind their murders could not be immediately 
determined 
during the uprising palestinians have killed at least 186 
fellow arabs on suspicion of assisting israeli authorities at 
least 657 palestinians have been killed by israeli troops or 
civilians and 43 israelis have been killed

after willie horton attacked a white couple while 
on furlough from a state prison george bushs campaign aides used 
his image as a potent political weapon 
when charles stuart plotted the killing of his wife as police 
have come to believe he thought he could convince an entire city 
that a black man had committed the crime and he nearly succeeded 
in doing so for more than two months 
both cases tapped into white fears and the stereotype of a 
ruthless marauding black man even though hortons furlough was 
one of many and carol stuart was much more likely to be killed by 
her husband than by a black stranger 
researchers and civil libertarians say the images of american 
blacks once obviously racist portrayals of blacks as dimwitted 
carefree or dangerous are more subtle these days but no less 
persuasive or damaging 
theres no question race is being used more often as a 
political tool said harvard university law professor alan 
dershowitz race is used and exploited in politics it 
corresponds to peoples fears and its being used on both sides 
patricia turner a professor of black studies at the university 
of massachusetts in boston traces negative portrayals of blacks in 
popular culture since before the civil war 
back then blacks were shown as docile and contented simple 
people who werent really up to the demands of the white world 
turner says they were seen as people who danced and sang all 
night and then were too tired to get up for work the next 
morning 
this dancing darkie image alternated with the uncle tom the 
benevolent kindly old black man turner said but the fear 
associated with willie horton is rooted in an image that gained 
currency after the civil war 
this was the buck an aggressive hostile young black man 
seen as wanting to molest white women often the buck was 
dressed in black and carried some sort of razor or knife and was 
set in juxtaposition to a white woman turner said 
charles stuart said his assailant was a black man in a black 
jogging suit noted turner who helped research ethnic notions 
a public televison documentary on the distorted image of blacks in 
american popular culture 
the film shows a scene from dw griffiths 1915 silent movie 
birth of a nation in which a white actor in blackface menaces 
a young white woman instead of letting herself be raped she jumps 
from a cliff to her death 
the buck image resurfaced whenever whites felt threatened by 
blacks after the abolition of slavery after world war i when 
returning black soldiers had heightened expectations of their place 
in american society and during the civil rights movement of the 
1960s 
the images though unreal had very real consequences 
one of the main reasons black men were lynched was that white 
men thought they wanted to rape white women said dr alvin 
poussaint a harvard medical school psychiatrist thats been a 
white american preoccupation 
in the 1988 presidential battle between george bush and gov 
michael dukakis a bush tv commercial showed a mug shot of a 
glowering horton and implied dukakis supported freeing convicted 
murderers for weekend furloughs 
critics said the commercials incited racial fears among whites 
and played on racist attitudes and biases 
last year stuarts account of being attacked by a black man 
used invoked the same negative racial image and his account led 
police to stop and search black males in bostons inner city 
race was used in both cases as a political tool said state 
rep byron rushing of boston a black lawmaker the idea of the 
negative black icon is so well known people can only use it in a 
cold and calculated manner its not a matter of someone saying 
oops 
the president rode willie horton into the white house it 
wasnt relevant to his ability to lead said louis elisa 
president of the boston chapter of the naacp race has become the 
easiest way to pass on fear

a topranking exiled leader of 
the african national congress in an unprecedented interview shown 
sunday on staterun television appealed to whites to help build a 
postapartheid south africa 
thabo mbeki the ancs equivalent of a foreign minister told 
viewers they had been the victims of a prolonged misinformation 
campaign that depicted his organization as seeking to impose a 
communiststyle oneparty state 
what has inspired the anc for all these 70plus years of its 
existence has been the vision of a south africa that belongs to all 
the people mbeki said from lusaka zambia the groups 
headquarters if they acted together they could transform this 
country into something great 
it was the first time the south african broadcasting corp has 
conducted and broadcast its own indepth interview with one of the 
ancs exiled leaders 
on thursday it carried an interview by two of its reporters 
with nelson mandela the anc leader freed feb 11 after 27 years in 
prison 
until feb 2 when president fw de klerk lifted a 30year ban 
on the anc it was a crime for south african media to quote mbeki 
and other senior anc leaders 
asked about de klerks peace initiative aimed at starting 
negotiations on a new constitution mbeki replied the road ahead 
is still a long road with lots of problems in front of us but 
hopefully the doors to a political settlement of this problem have 
been opened 
what white south africa needs to do is to join the process of 
ending the apartheid system he said presumably these people 
who acted together to change the past would have confidence enough 
in one another to build the future 
he said whites have a very very wrong perception of the anc 
the result of many decades of misinformation that the anc is 
some communistdominated group whose intention is to impose itself 
on the people of south africa with a oneparty state that its 
going to destroy the economy 
it is important that the anc should not be demonized in the 
eyes of the people mbeki said 
he said he was not surprised at a backlash among rightwing 
whites opposed to de klerks reforms 
a lot of white south africans like the idea of political power 
being monopolized by the whites he said it is important that 
this small minority should not be given a right of veto not be 
treated as a force to block change which the overwhelming majority 
of our people want 
he said conservative whites need to be convinced that they as 
individuals as families will be better off in a situation where 
they dont have to be guarding their houses with guard dogs arming 
themselves living in a situation of conflict and fear 
on friday the anc executive committee said in lusaka it would 
send a delegation to south africa for talks with de klerk on how to 
remove obstacles to full negotiations on a new constitution 
mbeki is expected to be in the delegation which will likely be 
joined by by mandela and other anc leaders based in south africa 
de klerk has lifted bans on the anc and other opposition groups 
said political exiles can come home and made other concessions that 
met many of the ancs preconditions for negotiations 
the anc is still demanding the lifting of the state of 
emergency which has been in effect since june 1986 and the 
release of all political prisoners including those convicted of 
acts of violence 
de klerk says the issue of prisoner releases could be a matter 
for negotiations and there is speculation he might lift the 
emergency in exchange for a suspension of violence by the anc 
the anc has waged a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 
aimed at ending whiteminority domination there have been few 
attacks in the past year and the campaign has posed minimal 
military threat to the government

the bush administrations fiscal 1991 budget 
would repeat wasteful mistakes of the previous decade by rushing 
weapon systems into production without adequate testing rep john 
dingell says 
when we look at our military procurement strategy it still 
reflects the thinking of the early 1980s dingell chairman of 
the house energy and commerce committee said in a feb 9 letter to 
president bush made public sunday 
the michigan democrat said 10 billion to 20 billion could be 
trimmed from bushs proposed 292 billion defense budget by 
delaying the purchase of weapons in need of further research and 
testing including a navy attack submarine and destroyer and the 
air forces b2 bomber 
pentagon spokeswoman chris cimko said she had not seen the 
letter and could not comment white house spokesman doug davidson 
also said he could not comment 
as the united states underwent its biggest military buildup 
since world war ii in the early 1980s the pentagons weapon 
acquisition policy was geared toward getting major weapons 
systems produced and fielded today not tomorrow dingell wrote 
the primary method for expediting these procurements was to 
rush the systems into production prior to the completion of design 
engineering and testing this process of concurrency or buy before 
you fly has resulted in untold waste 
in the worst case the reagan administration contracted to buy 
100 b1b bombers for more than 20 billion before the plane was 
properly tested and evaluated dingell said 
air force officials testified before dingells oversight and 
investigations subcommittee in 1986 that the bomber had major 
technical problems that crippled its ability to penetrate soviet 
airspace but the planes had been paid for by then dingell said 
bushs budget would continue rapid procurement which no longer 
is justified with the dramatic improvement in eastwest relations 
he said 
not only have the concurrency lessons of the b1 and other 
programs gone unheeded but the defense establishment now more than 
ever is attempting aggressively to produce systems before the 
designs are completed and adequately tested he said 
he described these items in bushs budget as unduly hasty 
two ssn21 sea wolf attack submarines for 37 billion the 
navy eventually wants 29 of the subs for 37 billion under the 
current schedule production of more than half would be under way 
at a cost of 20 billion before the first new sub undergoes sea 
trials dingell said 
five navy ddg51 arleigh burke destroyers for 37 billion as 
part of an eventual 33ship 27 billion program as with the 
ssn21 the navy will have contracted for production of more than 
half costing 15 billion before initial sea trials 
five b2 stealth bombers for 55 billion the air force 
envisions a 132aircraft 75 billion fleet but it may be scaled 
back to between 30 and 50 planes the 1991 budget would boost the 
number approved for production to 20 although tests have shown only 
that the plane will fly dingell said 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress has discovered major cost schedule and production 
problems with all three of the weapon systems he said 
numerous other systems in the budget would be produced with 
insufficient testing he said including the c17 cargo plane the 
mark50 torpedo the tf45 trainer the anbsy1 and anbsy2 
submarine combat systems and the amraam airtoair missile 
deleting the questionable expenditures from the budget pending 
satisfactory test results would save up to 20 billion dingell 
said 
some argue that slowing production would boost costs but such 
increases would be offset by ensuring that weapon systems are built 
correctly the first time and avoiding investment in systems that 
dont deliver as promised he said

occurred nakasones aides reportedly received 29000 
recruitcosmos shares which they later resold for a 414000

defense and foreign ministry officials were 
engaged in a sharp dispute sunday over the role of the nato 
alliance in a united germany 
defense ministry officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
stressed that natos security umbrella should extend over what is 
now east german territory the same proposal was made friday by 
defense minister gerhard stoltenberg 
foreign ministry officials said that foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher was deeply disappointed by stoltenbergs 
remarks they also spoke on condition of anonymity 
in a radio interview saturday genscher ruled out extending 
natos territory to what is now east germany 
genscher believes that stoltenbergs suggestions under which a 
united germany would belong to nato and german troops could be 
based throughout the country could hinder talks on unification 
with the soviet union united states britain and france foreign 
ministry officials said 
they said he intends to bring up the matter at a cabinet meeting 
this week 
west germanys army has about 490000 soldiers while east 
germany has 170000 soldiers in addition 380000 soviet troops 
are stationed in east germany while nato has more than 300000 
soldiers in west germany 
the soviet union is taking a hard line on german unification 
demanding it not be a member of nato and emphasizing that moscow 
seeks a reduction in the reunited countrys armed forces 
however two top western officials said sunday that the soviet 
union may ultimately accept full nato membership for a reunified 
germany because it would provide stability that is in moscows own 
interests 
secretary of state james a baker iii and manfred woerner 
secretarygeneral of the western alliance said they do not believe 
objections to full nato membership voiced by some soviet officials 
are the final word 
were going to have to see the degree to which they really 
feel that way baker said on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley for myself i would tell you that im not so sure 
that they really strongly feel that way 
baker said the alliance as the basis for the presence of us 
troops in europe is something that few on either side of the 
former iron curtain want to dissolve in the current unstable 
climate in eastern europe 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said sunday an 
agreement on german unification must respect existing borders in 
europe and the rights of the four allied powers 
mrs thatcher who is uneasy about rapid moves toward german 
unification said she hoped a united germany would remain part of 
nato with american troops stationed there with some special 
arrangements for east germany to meet the soviet unions security 
concerns indeed it would be quite reasonable for some soviet 
troops to remain there at least for a transitional period

the 20 classaction lawsuits filed against 
ashland oil inc for a 1988 diesel fuel spill that disrupted water 
service in three states have been settled out of court for 30 
million 
us district judge d brooks smith approved the settlement 
friday and awarded 46 million in fees to the 28 law firms that 
brought the litigation 
at a hearing smith said it was fortunate the case was being 
settled out of court because there is a shortage of federal judges 
available to take cases in the region 
thomas donovan a lawyer for ashland described the agreement as 
eminently fair and reasonable howard specter one of the 
plaintiffs lawyers said the agreement was hard fought and 
hard earned 
the terms smith approved are identical to those in a preliminary 
settlement filed in november 
the agreement which takes effect in 30 days settles lawsuits 
filed after the collapse of a storage tank jan 2 1988 at 
ashlands floreffe terminal in jefferson about 25 miles south of 
pittsburgh 
about 700000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled into the 
monongahela river killing thousands of fish and birds and forcing 
water systems in pennsylvania west virginia and ohio to stop 
drawing water from the monongahela and ohio rivers as the fuel made 
its way downstream 
a panel appointed by gov robert p casey concluded ashland was 
negligent in erecting a tank of substandard steel and filling it 
without proper testing and review 
although the overall value of the settlement is 30 million 14 
million of that already has been spent or committed for civil 
penalties natural resource damages and expenses incurred by the 
plaintiffs 
of the other 16 million 46 million will go for attorneys 
fees and 560000 for the attorneys costs and for expenses in 
administering the settlement 
that leaves nearly 11 million for claims by individuals and 
businesses for lost wages lost sales property damage and loss or 
reduction of water supplies 
ashland officials however do not expect claims to total that 
much because the company previously settled about 5000 claims 
david berger a lawyer for the plaintiffs said the legal fees 
were justified by the complexity and intensity of the case 
ashland officials say insurance covers the 30 million 
settlement a separate federal criminal fine of 225 million and 
11 million in cleanup costs the oil company based in ashland 
ky had to make a 25 million deductible payment 
ashland has not disclosed its legal expenses or the costs of 
environmental studies it commissioned for the litigation

the united nations opens a special session 
tuesday on the international antidrug war seeking ways to cut 
supplies reduce demand and undo traffickers schemes for 
laundering profits 
but it is unclear if the world body can make a dent in the 
problem when it is so badly strapped for funds 
the funds that we have at our disposal are extremely limited 
in relation to the problem said margaret anstee 
directorgeneral of the un office in vienna and coordinator of 
un drug programs in an interview in the area of drugs we are 
being asked to do much more with less 
she said it is estimated that the illegal world drug trade 
brings in 500 billion annually second only to the international 
arms trade the united nations has set aside about 4 million a 
year to fight its drug war ms antsee said 
as people have often pointed out that is probably less than 
the cost of a suitcase full of heroine at any airport in europe 
she said 
un officials and diplomats say the fourday un session is 
expected to conclude with a global plan to fight drugs and measures 
to enhance the un role in that effort 
the illicit drug trade and related social problems plague 
nations rich and poor large and small but while there is general 
agreement that a global attack is needed members of the 159member 
world body plan to stress differing approaches and concerns 
the united states will press for other countries particularly 
in europe to contribute more money for the international offensive 
us officials see the un session as an important followup to 
a regional drug summit attended by president bush last week in 
colombia however they also plan to stress that the drug scourge 
is not limited to the united states and latin american countries 
colombia under siege by powerful drug cartels and crippled by 
economic woes seeks preferential treatment in the global 
marketplace so it can continue its antidrug fight and encourage 
farmers to switch to legal crops 
for its part cuba wants to ensure its sovereignty is not 
violated by heightened law enforcement as part of an international 
attack on drug trafficking 
cuba and hopefully other countries will press for 
international law to be followed and the sovereignty of nations to 
be respected so these are not violated under the protection of 
fighting narcotics trafficking said ricardo alarcon de quesada 
cubas un ambassador 
a cuban freighter was hit at least twice by fire from a us 
coast guard cutter jan 31 when its crew refused to allow a search 
us authorities suspected the vessel was involved in drug 
smuggling 
at the colombia summit thursday the presidents of the united 
states colombia bolivia and peru signed a communique vowing 
closer coordination in the drug fight 
they called for a world conference against illicit drug 
trafficking in 1991 and a highlevel latin american followup in 
six months 
their agreements commit the us government to provide economic 
aid to help the three andean nations wage the drug battle and 
persuade their farmers to grow alternate crops to the coca plant 
which is used in producing cocaine 
their communique also calls for tougher enforcement of drug laws 
and increased international gun control

the remains of gen omar torrijos 
panamas former military leader who died in a 1981 plane crash 
were transferred to another crypt a family member said sunday 
torrijos remains were dug up saturday from the mausoleum at 
fort amador a joint uspanamanian facility and placed in a 
crypt at the national shrine alongside the cremated remains of his 
parents said his daughter raquel torrijos 
she said she decided to move her fathers remains to avoid 
desecration of his tomb 
the torrijos family has said it was worried that panamas new 
government might decide to eliminate the masoleum where the remains 
had been held although the government has denied having any such 
plans the leadership in the present government dislikes torrijos 
on oct 11 1968 he overthrew the elected government of arnulfo 
arias 
his rule is best remembered for the panama canal treaties he 
signed in 1977 with former president jimmy carter they hand over 
control of the canal to panama before the end of the century 
torrijos died july 31 1981 when a panamanian military plane 
exploded the crash was officially listed as an accident but 
torrijos brother has accused the cia of murdering the former 
leader a former panamanianmilitary official in 1987 accused manuel 
antonio noriega of having masterminded torrijos death 
noriega who was torrijos successor as head of the nations 
defense forces was overthrown in the dec 20 military invasion by 
the united states

the world bank has developed a computerized 
library designed to help third world governments increase their 
economic competitiveness on international markets 
the idea is to provide developing countries with something 
more like a level playing field when theyre negotiating with 
countries that have huge computer systems of their own said sam 
laird an australian economist at the bank who has taken a major 
part in working out the system 
for example when an american investor suggests building a new 
widget factory in bhutan or burundi a cabinet minister in that 
country could use the system to find out what countries have been 
supplying this device to japan and whether they have been 
receiving any special breaks 
the computerized file would also give tariff rates point the 
way to finding out japans special import rules and suggest other 
possible markets pressing another button would calculate how many 
more widgets japan might buy if its government could be persuaded 
to cut the tariff in half 
the program is called smart software for market analysis 
and restrictions on trade 
designed for use by governments smart does not contain data 
about individual companies and is not being made available to them 
in this country youd probably be able to get it through the 
freedom of information act laird suggested 
some countries have furnished information they consider 
confidential so far the system has been loaded with data from the 
united states and other major industrial areas the markets that 
third world countries most want to hit and from mexico south 
korea and hong kong 
though smart is not generally meant for richer governments 
laird said many are using it including the agriculture and 
commerce departments in this country and the european economic 
community 
laird said that when he demonstrated it to one official in 
switzerland the official said he had been trying for three months 
to collect one set of data shown him 
laird noted that some third world governments have been 
unwilling to participate in the set of worldwide trade talks called 
the uruguay round now going on giving them more information 
would further the policies of the united states and other major 
trading countries that are trying to stimulate their interest he 
added 
with the help of the united nations the world bank the biggest 
source of aid to third world countries is offering governments the 
necessary half dozen computer diskettes for about 50 to cover the 
cost of the material they are also giving demonstrations to 
interested governments one for frenchspeaking africans in april 
in morocco another later for englishspeaking countries in kenya 
and many others all over the world 
the diskettes can be loaded into a lowpriced personal computer 
laird said his own computer cost about 1000 and smart used up 
only about a quarter of its capacity the information will be 
updated every year 
part of the data now available is two or three years old because 
more recent figures have not been published

the soviet union may ultimately accept full 
nato membership for a reunified germany because it would provide 
stability that is in moscows own interests two top western 
officials said sunday 
secretary of state james a baker iii and manfred woerner 
secretary general of the western alliance said they do not believe 
objections to full nato membership voiced by some soviet officials 
are the final word 
were going to have to see the degree to which they really 
feel that way baker said on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley program for myself i would tell you that im not so 
sure that they really strongly feel that way 
baker said the alliance as the basis for the presence of us 
troops in europe is something that few on either side of the 
former iron curtain want to dissolve in the current unstable 
climate in eastern europe 
i think without putting words in the mouths of the soviets 
that they see the stability that is afforded by the continued 
presence of united states forces in europe he said 
on saturday a top adviser to soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev valentin falin said in a radio interview monitored in 
west berlin that if the western alliance insists on nato 
membership for all of germany then there wont be any german 
unification 
the statement underscored what has appeared to be a hardening of 
the soviet position against nato membership for a united germany 
and the prospects for an impasse as the two sides begin the 
socalled two plus four discussions among the two germanys and the 
allied powers associated with them the united states france 
britain and the soviet union 
woerner also speaking on the abctv program sunday was even 
more direct 
i think the russians will accept such a solution of course 
under one condition that we give them a clear guarantee this is 
not turning against them he said 
what you see at this very moment is a kind of tactical play 
which is very natural woerner added contending that gorbachev 
himself has made no firm commitment on the question of german 
alignment 
he was very cautious and noncommittal on that and you have 
very different and vague responses from high soviet leaders said 
woerner 
so i think if they really think their own legitimate security 
interests through it will be better for them to have a germany 
which is in a stable condition and is firmly embedded in safety and 
security structures than to have a neutral germany floating around 
trying to form alliances woerner said 
without an anchor in nato woerner added a neutral germany 
would revert into national rivalries of the sort which led to 
world wars i and ii and we want that not to happen again 
both baker and woerner repeated assurances that under nato 
membership military forces of the alliance would not be advanced 
into what is now east germany 
the discussions are likely to be driven ahead faster than either 
side is prepared for because of economic discontent in the east and 
a flow of fortuneseekers across the border to the west 
unification is taking place as we sit here this morning on 
the ground economically baker said there is de facto 
economic integration unification taking place he said adding 
that there is an excellent chance that the two germanys will be 
back together before the year is out 
horst teltschik foreign policy adviser to west german 
chancellor helmut kohl also predicted that unification would occur 
this year 
nobody can slow down that process neither the soviets nor we 
because the people in east germany are the only ones who are 
responsible for what will happen he said on the cbs program 
face the nation 
teltschik said the german democratic republic is near economic 
collapse and its western neighbor expects 100000 immigrants this 
month alone this is a development the gdr cant survive he 
said

the deaths of 11 bottlenose dolphins 
during the past month in waters near the floridaalabama line have 
mystified a scientist who examined the carcasses 
eleven in one month is historic if not significant said 
gerald regan a biology professor at spring hill college in mobile 
ala and a member of the national marine mammal stranding network 
until now an average of only 12 dead dolphins a year has turned 
up in perdido bay which separates alabama from the florida 
panhandle and in adjacent waters of the gulf of mexico regan said 
saturday 
the cause of the deaths hasnt been determined regan said he is 
awaiting an analysis of lung samples sent to the sea world research 
institute in orlando before drawing any conclusions 
some members of a local environmental group have blamed 
pollution 
the lillian alabased perdido bay environmental association is 
collecting donations to pay for the laboratory tests on the dead 
dolphins said group vice president jo ann allen 
she said there is growing concern about the impact that 
pollution from sewage treatment plants and paper mills has had on 
the bay 
however regan said that at this point he knows more about what 
didnt kill the animals than what did 
he said he didnt think the dolphins died of violence from 
people or from choking on debris such as plastic bags we 
havent found any scars or cuts the biologist said 
regan also has ruled out starvation because all the dolphins had 
food in their stomachs and crossed off old age because the victims 
have been of various sizes 
he said he didnt believe the dolphins were killed by a december 
freeze because the first dead animal didnt turn up until long 
after the cold snap 
one theory is that the dolphins may have suffered from a virus 
that affected their immune systems said jacqueline lane a biology 
instructor at pensacola junior college 
dolphins also have been dying for unexplained reasons in the 
atlantic ocean she pointed out sea worlds research branch has 
joined others in looking into those deaths as well 
a twoyear study on pollution in perdido bay being conducted by 
the us environmental protection agency may turn up some clues in 
the dolphin deaths said jim clark a research aquatic biologist at 
the agencys pensacola beach laboratory

construction is to begin monday on a 
religious center to house roman catholic nuns who have outraged 
many jews by refusing to leave a convent at the edge of the 
auschwitz death camp 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki and edgar bronfman president 
of the world jewish congress are to announce the start of building 
after meeting in warsaw spokesmen said 
the groundbreaking will come nearly a year after the feb 22 
1989 deadline for moving the nuns under a 1987 accord reached by 
catholic and jewish religious leaders in geneva 
jewish groups and others view the presence of the small group of 
carmelite nuns as an offensive intrusion of christianity at the 
death camp built by the nazis mainly to exterminate jews because 
of their religion 
despite the geneva agreement the polish church with backing 
from other quarters in overwhelmingly catholic poland balked at 
moving the nuns from a former theater used by the nazis as a 
warehouse to store zyklon b cylinders for the gas chambers 
after international outcry grew the vatican intervened and 
announced its support for the construction of the religious center 
it will be a quartermile from the death camp on a nineacre site 
the official news agency pap said sunday 
the presence of the auschwitz convent represents a most most 
serious issue to the international jewish community which is 
prepared to assist in transforming postcommunist polands 
shattered economy said marem stern political consultant to the 
world jewish conference 
it is not that we are antipolish but it is an issue that 
has to be solved and quickly because with this whole opening of 
poland we have a lot of jews who are ready to come here and 
invest stern said in a sunday interview 
bronfman will tell mazowiecki that help is ready but he will 
also have to explain that he will not do anything until this is 
solved stern said 
the convent issue touches on deeply sensitive issues in poland 
where a preworld war ii jewish population of 35 million has been 
reduced to several thousand 
about 3 million polish jews were killed during the war most of 
those who survived subsequently emigrated the last wave of 
departures taking place after an antisemitic political purge in 
1968 
known officially as the center for information dialogue 
education and prayer at auschwitz the new building will include 
meeting rooms exhibition and conference halls a library and 
accommodations for nearly 100 people pap said 
a separate section of the building will house the convent the 
rev marek glownia said in a statement the archdiocese of krakow 
appointed glownia to lead the center and oversee construction 
the vatican has pledged financial support for the construction 
and funds also will be raised by foundations and churches elsewhere 
in europe

business leaders expressed relief and predicted a 
period of renewed economic stability following the strong showing 
by the governing liberal democratic party in parliamentary 
elections sunday 
im relieved at the outcome eiji suzuki president of the 
japan federation of employers association said as the probusiness 
ldp appeared headed for a majority in the powerful lower house of 
parliament 
some bankers predicted the yen would strengthen against the us 
dollar in the elections aftermath business leaders said the 
results showed public acceptance for a controversial sales tax 
adopted by the ldp last year 
with 431 out of 512 seats decided early monday the liberal 
democrats who have guided policy for 34 years that turned japan 
into an economic superpower held 240 seats against 114 by the 
largest opposition group the socialists 
i can breathe a little easier now that political stability is 
secured at least for the time being said eishiro saito chairman 
of the powerful japan federation of economic organizations 
keidanren 
saito said the liberal democrats victory is a result of the 
nations choice for political stability kyodo news service 
reported 
but suzuki warned that election gains by the socialists who had 
83 seats before the election show that the governing party must 
carry out political reform as quickly as possible to recover the 
peoples trust 
the liberal democrats popularity plunged to record lows last 
year after a series of bribery and sex scandals that led to the 
loss of their upper house majority for the first time since their 
formation in 1955 some business leaders had feared that a liberal 
democratic loss in the lower house would disrupt japanese economic 
growth and stability 
worries about the election outcome held volume down on the tokyo 
stock exchange most of last week and have been cited as a major 
factor behind the markets weakness since the start of the year 
concern about a possible ldp upset also has helped drive up 
interest rates sharply in recent weeks and kept the yen weak 
against the us dollar analysts and dealers have said 
in a survey late sunday of officials at 22 banks and brokerage 
houses 11 said they believed the election outcome would cause the 
yen to rise briefly against the us dollar three predicted a 
longerterm rise by the yen and eight said the election would have 
little effect on exchange rates the japan broadcasting corp nhk 
said 
the public television network said 15 of the companies it 
contacted predicted the dollar would end the coming week in tokyo 
at about 144145 yen last friday the us currency closed in 
tokyo at 14455 yen 
business leaders said the election also showed the public now

a railroad tank car full of propane burned 
through the day sunday a day after derailment of a train carrying 
hazardous chemicals touched off an explosion and forced several 
families to leave their homes 
firefighters decided after the accident saturday to let the 
propane burn itself out rather than risk touching off another 
explosion by dousing unseen hot spots in the car said capt 
darrell stevenson of the corsicana fire department 
no one was injured 
firefighters under the supervision of the texas railroad 
commission pumped water into the burning tanker sunday forcing the 
propane to rise and burn off 
stevenson said officials were unsure how much propane was left 
in the tanker or how long the fire would burn 
several families within a mile of the accident site were 
evacuated from their homes saturday and all but three of the 
families were back home sunday 
investigators havent been able to get close enough to the 
wreckage to determine what caused the 44car train to lose 24 cars 
on a curve shortly before 830 am saturday the train belongs to 
the burlington northern railroad 
a spilled car of sodium chlorate powder caused concerns 
firefighters said the chemical used in manufacturing explosives 
and cosmetics could feed the fire spreading flames beyond the 
scattered wreckage in a remote area near emhouse a community of 
200 about 45 miles south of dallas 
the chemical reacts violently with water 
the three train crew members underwent drug tests a normal 
procedure following train derailments the results havent been 
made public

demonstrators yelling down with 
communism smashed their way into interim government headquarters 
with rocks and iron rods sunday in the most violent protest since 
the december prodemocracy revolution 
soldiers fell back before more than 1000 demonstrators and 
about 500 protesters poured inside an official said not enough 
troops were on hand to keep order 
the state news agency rompres said more than 20 paratroopers 
were severely wounded but reporters saw only two injured soldiers 
hundreds of troop reinforcements arrived and pushed back the 
crowd which numbered around 5000 at its height and 10 armored 
personnel carriers were positioned in front of the building 
the army blocked the entrance after allowing many demonstrators 
to leave an infantry captain speaking on condition of anonymity 
said about 150 people were arrested and remained inside the 
building guarded by soldiers 
the building on victory square has been used by prime minister 
petre roman since the revolution that toppled longtime communist 
dictator nicolae ceausescu later executed 
roman who was in paris on a fourday official visit said the 
protesters represented an insignificant portion of the population 
he told french tv network antenne2 that he spoke with officials of 
the ruling provisional council for national unity who assured him 
all is in order 
at this time we are only a provisional council roman said 
we do not have a real legitimacy but these 200 persons that 
entered the building of the provisional government they represent 
nothing 
roman told french journalists earlier sunday that his eastern 
european nation had reached political stability under the 
leadership of iliescu increasingly disliked for his communist past 
the enraged crowd stormed the offices sunday afternoon shouting 
for interim president ion iliescu to resign and accusing the 
provisional government of being dominated by communists from the 
ceausescu regime 
the only member of government in the building apparently was 
vice prime minister gelu voican voiculescu 
demonstrators seized him punched him and dragged him onto a 
balcony where he was jeered soldiers hustled him to his office 
where they guarded him from hundreds of demonstrators yelling 
voican voican 
the crowd broke into the building after soldiers hauled away 
protesters who scaled the building and waved romanian flags from a 
balcony protesters went into a frenzy tearing iron bars from the 
carpet in front of the building 
protesters told the crowd one man who was hauled away had been 
shot prompting cries of assassins murderers 
more than 1000 people in front of the building cheered as 
protesters smashed the windows and glass doors hundreds surged 
inside infantry reinforcements arrived a short time later 
voiculescu told the associated press the demonstration caught 
authorities unprepared with not enough paratroopers on hand to 
contain the crowd 
he said the only thing left to do would have been to shoot at 
the people the armys job is not to shoot at the people let them 
run around 
he accused opposition parties of inciting the violence and 
charged that they were using the securitate the hated secret 
police under ceausescu 
protesters shouted that the government had not disbanded the 
securitate as it had promised the only solution is another 
revolution they yelled 
they failed to find iliescu who recently moved his office to 
the old grand national assembly building several miles away 
headquarters for the provisional ruling council 
rampaging demonstrators broke windows dug through office 
cabinets and hurled books by ceausescu and communist party manuals 
to the screaming crowd outside 
scores of supporters of the national salvation front which took 
power after the revolution began a small counterdemonstration 
crying terrorists terrorists 
antigovernment demonstrators included young and old students 
and workers they said they belonged to no particular political 
party 
what we want is democracy said student cezar rasuceanu 22 
anger has built since the national salvation front said it 
planned to take part in may elections the front then gave up power 
and the council of national unity was formed 
opponents have accused the front of packing the council and 
seeking a return to oneparty rule 
the demonstration started like others this past week in victory 
square with about 200 people arguing with one another in the 
midmorning sunlight 
but at about 230 pm protesters seeking iliescu smashed 
windows and the doors with their hands 
when soldiers dragged away the protesters who had scaled the 
building about two hours later demonstrators cried one had been 
shot and the crowd surged toward the building hurling iron bars 
bottles rocks and sticks 
an army colonel in the government building told a reporter if 
we had gotten an order to fire we would have fired and finished 
this off in two seconds he spoke on condition of anonymity 
the demonstration was far smaller than on jan 28 when when 
more than 15000 antigovernment demonstrators demanded that the 
national salvation front share power with opposition parties 
that was a factor in the creation of the provisional council of 
national unity which is to rule until may 20 general elections 
the council includes 37 political parties ethnic minority 
groups and representatives of various occupations and interest 
groups

the united national opposition sunday 
held the largest antigovernment rally in 10 years and its 
presidential candidate promised peace in central america if she 
wins 
campaigning for next sundays general elections officially ends 
wednesday and it was unos last rally 
the broad usbacked coalition of 14 parties and one native 
indian organization known as uno is the major rival of the 
ruling sandinista national liberation front 
on this bright day which announces the end of the dark night 
of sandinismo i raise my flag of national reconciliation 
violeta barrios de chamorro told a crowd of about 60000 
mrs chamorro repeated campaign promises to end the draft 
rebuild the economy and reduce the size of the army the largest in 
central america 
next sunday the vote of the people is going to knock down 
the wall of shame as the german people did with the berlin wall 
she told cheering supporters at the plaza of the revolution 
she is challenging president daniel ortega for a sixyear term 
in an election that has been called a referendum on 10 years of 
sandinista rule 
uno is expected to run its media campaign until wednesday when 
the sandinistas will hold their final rally 
about 17 million nicaraguans nearly half of the population of 
38 million have registered to vote in the elections for president 
and vice president national assembly 144 municipal councils and 
two regional councils 
the rally drew the biggest opposition attendance yet uno 
complained however that officials refused to allow in a sound 
system rented in neighboring costa rica and that supporters coming 
from provincial towns were blocked or harassed 
police in riot gear had been stationed throughout managua since 
saturday night and police jeeps with tear gas grenadelaunchers 
were lined up on streets 
public transport was almost nonexistent in the capital sunday 
morning some people said they did not attend the rally because 
they feared trouble or had no way of getting there 
they police stopped our caravan outside masaya a town 30 
minutes from managua said one man at the rally who would only 
give his first name santos they kept us there for a long time 
and people were getting angry they finally let us go but one 
truck at a time very slowly 
mrs chamorros running mate virgilio godoy spoke of 200000 
people at the rally but international observers and journalists 
agreed on the estimate of 60000 
mrs chamorro publisher of the newspaper la prensa promised 
that nicaraguas soldiers would be be trained for civilian jobs and 
none would be left unemployed although the estimated 
150000member armed forces would have to be slashed 
and to my dear friends in central america i assure them that 
with the internal peace of nicaragua central america also will 
have peace she said 
i will not allow a soldier to be made of each child she 
said to wild cheers alluding to the obligatory twoyear military 
service for all boys age 16 
our democracy will have more teachers than soldiers and many 
more schools than barracks 
mrs chamorro has little political experience and is not rated 
as a good speaker sundays address was considered her best 
she was chosen to challenge ortega largely for her symbolic 
value as the widow of pedro joaquin chamorro a publisher and civic 
leader who was killed during the dictatorship of anastasio somoza 
and whose memory is revered by all in nicaraguas political 
spectrum 
her right leg still in a cast because of a fractured knee mrs 
chamorro spoke from a raised stage while sitting in her wheelchair 
next to godoy 
in what was interpreted as a reply to sandinista accusations 
that uno is planning violent incidents to mar the elections mrs 
chamorro said i urge all nicaraguans to be calm so that next 
sunday they go to vote and then go home so as to avoid an 
incident 
she said the best achievement of the campaign was that our 
country has overcome fear and has acquired a greater civic 
conscience 
godoy appealed to women voters who make up 54 percent of 
registered voters 
in the hands of the nicaraguan woman is the future of the 
republic and we know they wont leave it in this mess godoy 
said

southeast of moscow

buildings broke windows and smashed public vehicles

to a spate of deadly mail bombings in the south 
emmanuel hammond 24 of marietta is charged with felony murder 
murder kidnapping and armed robbery in the death of julie love 
27 whose 1988 disappearance sparked a search that lasted more than 
a year prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty if he is 
convicted 
hammond is black ms love is white a letter claiming 
responsibility for the december mail bomb slayings cited ms loves 
death and decried crimes by blacks against whites 
police allege that hammond was the triggerman his cousin 
william porter pleaded guilty to murder and other charges in the 
case and is expected to testify against him 
jury selection is to begin monday in fulton county superior 
court 
defense attorney william a wehunt has said the enormous 
publicity surrounding ms loves disappearance and the discovery of 
her body could make selecting an impartial jury difficult wehunt 
however dropped an earlier effort to move the trial out of fulton 
county which includes most of atlanta 
the search that followed ms loves disappearance in july 1988 
included billboards and posters all over the atlanta area bearing 
the message have you seen julie love 
ms loves body was found in august in a wooded dumping ground 
in atlanta and hammond was arrested that month he is being held 
at the fulton county jail without bond

television station received the letter claiming responsibility for 
the mailbomb deaths of a federal appeals judge robert vance in 
mountain brook ala and attorney robert robinson in savannah

appeals in atlanta on which vance served and at the jacksonville 
fla office of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people 
two small bombs exploded saturday in grocery stores in roswell 
about 20 miles north of atlanta but no one was injured and the 
city police chief jerry king said the latest bombings didnt appear 
to be linked to the earlier ones 
fulton county authorities have promised heavy courtroom security 
for the hammond trial including extra sheriffs deputies to stand 
guard and daily searches by bombsniffing dogs 
the trial was to have started jan 30 but was postponed because 
mental competence hearings for the defendant werent completed in 
time hammond was found competent to stand trial and judge ralph 
hicks set a new date 
porter 20 of union city who pleaded guilty in november to 
felony murder rape kidnapping and armed robbery has yet to be

dozens of soviet jews demonstrated in cold wind 
and pouring rain on sunday to protest their living conditions even 
as president chaim herzog welcomed new arrivals 
it was the first such protest since a mass soviet jewish 
immigration began last year 
in 1989 about 12000 soviet jews came to israel more than 
8000 have arrived so far this year and israel expects up to 
100000 soviet jews by years end due to more liberal soviet 
emigration policies us visa restrictions and rising 
antisemitism in the soviet union 
the protesters gathered at jerusalems gilo absorption center 
the countrys largest they held signs reading until now you did 
not give me anything and new immigrant your debt to the 
jewish agency is eternal 
the quasigovernmental jewish agency helps handle immigration 
and is responsible for gilo where 850 immigrants live 
the protesters complained that ceilings and walls leaked when it 
rained and that central heating was turned off 
they said the gas heaters they were given were dangerous 
pointing to the case of an elderly soviet woman who died last month 
after a gas heater explosion at gilo 
the immigrants who spoke on condition of anonymity also 
complained that families living on 400 a month had to pay 250 in 
rent at gilo 
jewish agency spokesman gad benari said the agency decided last 
week to close gilo within a year because of housing quality 
problems he said gilo residents would be housed in rented 
apartments and public housing until a new absorption center was 
built in jerusalem 
herzog and a group of dancing children meanwhile greeted 110 
soviet jews who arrived at bengurion airport near tel aviv from 
budapest hungary 
the children gave the immigrants roses and little israeli flags 
but herzog warned the newcomers not everyhting in israel would be 
as pleasant 
israel is settling many soviet jews in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip land it captured during the 1967 middle east war 
arab nations oppose such a policy and say it will destroy chances 
for peace in the region 
in manama bahrain the rulers of bahrain and the united arab 
emirates conferred sunday amid signs the arab world was delaying a 
decision on convening a special summit on the issue 
emirates president sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan arrived 
saturday from a visit to egypt where he advocated holding the 
summit which was first called for by king hussein of jordan two 
weeks ago 
the gulf news agency said that after his talks sunday with the 
emir of bahrain sheik isa bin salman al khalifa the two discussed 
arab issues in talks characterized by frankness and 
understanding 
in arab diplomatic terminology frank indicates differences 
of opinion 
sources said the prospects of a summit and the subjects it would 
tackle were major issues in the bahrain talks 
the two countries are grouped with saudi arabia kuwait qatar 
and oman in the sixnation gulf cooperation council alliance which 
coordinates policy on regional arab and international issues 
aside from the statements by sheik zayed and a statement from 
kuwait the other alliance members have not picked up jordans 
summit call 
diplomatic sources said the alliance as a whole and other 
nations of the 22member arab league support the idea of a summit 
but want it convened only after clearing up interarab differences 
foremost is the feud between syria and iraq

two small bombs that exploded in suburban 
atlanta grocery stores didnt cause any injuries and apparently 
were unrelated to a series of bombings in the south last year that 
killed two authorities said sunday 
no one was hurt in either of the bombings saturday though one 
bomb exploded while dozens of customers were still in the store a 
cub foods market in this suburb 20 miles north of atlanta 
both explosions followed telephoned threats to the stores 
similar calls to two other supermarkets prompted evacuations but 
no bombs were found 
the fuse train is all that detonated so the effect of the 
bombs was really only that of a firecracker fbi spokesman pat 
johnson said of the cub foods bomb it didnt do much damage 
except to its packaging 
federal agents said sunday they were still trying to determine 
the type of explosive used they refused to comment on a possible 
motive or divulge other details of the investigation by local 
authorities and agents of the fbi and federal bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms 
roswells police chief jerry king said the incidents didnt 
seem to be linked to unsolved mail bombings that killed a federal 
judge in alabama and a lawyer in savannah in december 
at cub foods witnesses said about 100 customers remained in the 
store when the bomb detonated in the paper products section 
we got all the store personnel running registers and bagging 
to hurry up and get them out said royce pugh cub foods 
assistant customer services manager who took the warning call 
i heard a boom and ran to look said shopper chuck culpepper 
of roswell all i saw was a bunch of toilet paper in the aisle 
and debris from where the bomb shot it sounded like a bunch of 
cherry bombs going off 
at the kroger perishables manager rhonda bartlett said managers 
oversaw a quick evacuation groceries were left piled on checkout 
counters and in baskets and the explosion came as shoppers and 
employees stood outside 
we did not hear it not at all she said we were just 
informed by the police that the explosion happened 
federal explosives and fbi agents and four explosivessniffing 
dogs from the atlanta police department searched all four stores 
to my knowledge nothing was found in the other two stores 
they were both checked and both found to be clear said atf 
spokesman tom stokes 
stokes said that investigators were trying to identify the type 
of explosives used he said there were no suspects so far 
agents took a package and pieces of cardboard apparently 
covered with gunpowder residue from the kroger

a 13yearold vietnamese immigrant who lied about 
his age was tried as an adult and sentenced to 38 years in prison 
four years ago for an armed robbery a newspaper reported sunday 
authorities are reexamining the case of luan van hoang who 
said he told police his name was michael nguyen and that he was 17 
to avoid being returned to a california home for juvenile 
offenders the dallas morning news said 
the boy whod lived in the united states for four years and had 
limited knowledge of the legal system when arrested said he 
believed vietnamese friends who told him that lying about his age 
would result in probation 
dallas county authorities said they accepted luans story and 
tried him as an adult 
but after reviewing records obtained by the morning news that 
show luan was a juvenile district attorney john vance on friday 
took steps to return the boy to dallas to determine whether he 
should remain in prison 
were happy to know this vance said if he is in fact a 
juvenile he has no business being in our prison as an adult 
luan now 17 is at the maximumsecurity wynne prison in 
huntsville with men many of them twice his age serving time for 
murder and other violent crimes 
he said some of the men have tried to attack him sexually 
i looked young luan said if you are weak they will try 
they did try they see i am different i was scared they tried to 
hurt me i tried to protect myself 
texas prisons are limited to adult convicts and juvenile 
convicts 15 and older who are certified to stand trial as adults 
offenders under 15 are supposed to be tried in juvenile courts and 
if found delinquent sent to texas youth commission centers 
luans father tien van hoang wrote state district judge jack 
hampton who presided over luans trial that his son was underage 
nobody answer said the moreno valley calif man nobody 
write to me anything 
texas department of corrections officials know luan only as 
michael nguyen department spokesman charles brown said nguyens 
file shows a birth date of jan 8 1968 and identifies his father 
as tien van hoang 
there are errors all the time brown said if theres an 
error were not opposed to correcting it i dont think its our 
error though 
neither the boy nor his family has a copy of his birth 
certificate 
when i escape from vietnam by boat everything was lost 
said tien who was in the south vietnamese army and was imprisoned 
by the communists after the fall of saigon in 1975 
he escaped from prison in 1982 he and his family sailed to the 
united states 
according to us immigration and naturalization service 
documents luan was born on oct 10 1972 in south vietnam 
california public school records give the same date 
it would appear to me that this person has been illegally 
sentenced and should be released if you can prove his age said 
ron jackson executive director of the texas youth commission 
juvenile court records are confidential but luan said he was 
sent to a california halfway house for boys after arrests for 
joyriding and auto theft 
he said he fled after serving eight months of a ninemonth 
sentence he hitched a ride to texas and joined a band of 
vietnamese youths who police said were involved in robbing asian 
refugees in the dallas area 
luan admitted being present during the robbery of a man at 
gunpoint on jan 29 1986 
police say they eventually linked luan to several robberies in 
the area before his trial dallas county assistant district 
attorney lana mcdaniel offered luan a plea bargain but he refused 
he was convicted and sentenced to 38 years 
luans girlfriend testified at the trial that the youth was 17 
ms mcdaniel said she relied upon the police determination of 
luans age 
what am i supposed to do she said i cant investigate 
the age of every kid who tells us hes 17 he needs to learn not 
to lie when his life is on the line

a ship carrying coffee from el 
salvador was turned away from a fourth port sunday because of 
protests spurred by the killing of six priests in that country 
dockworkers refused to unload 34 tons of coffee from the 
freighter ciudad de buenaventura honoring a picket line of about 
100 proponents of a boycott of salvadoran coffee 
over ten days the ships cargo has been turned away from san 
francisco vancouver british columbia seattle and now the port 
of long beach 25 miles south of downtown los angeles 
the fact that the ship was unsuccessful in landing on the west 
coast sends a strong message to all shippers that theyre going to 
have real trouble here said denise bergez spokeswoman for 
neighbor to neighbor an activist group its going to cost them 
a lot of money to try to bring coffee to the west coast 
the san franciscobased organization called for the boycott to 
protest us support for the salvadoran government the death 
squads it accuses the government of supporting and the killings 
there of six jesuit priests government troops have been implicated 
in the slayings 
coffee is one of el salvadors principal exports with about 60 
percent of the harvest worth 400 million shipped to the united 
states each year 
union dock workers have announced their support for the boycott 
and some us coffee companies agreed to stop shipping coffee to 
the west coast

ignoring pressure by labor big 
business and political groups the government reaffirmed its 
commitment to combat hyperinflation and recession by balancing the 
budget and selling public companies 
there will be no change in the direction of the economic 
plan economy minister antonio gonzalez said sunday at a news 
conference broadcast nationwide after a twohour cabinet meeting 
chaired by president carlos menem 
the meeting followed the slide of argentinas currency by 28 
percent against the us dollar last week drastic price markups 
in stores and strikes by public workers that disrupted banks 
federal courtrooms and oil fields 
the bankworkers association vows to shut all five national 
banks including the central bank on monday to protest plans to 
close 14 branches of the national mortgage bank and cut 1200 jobs 
university professors whose salaries were eroded by 79 percent 
inflation in january say they wont work beginning monday until 
they get a pay hike the government says it cannot afford that 
boycott could stall the start of classes next month 
gonzalez seemed to meet such opposition head on the 
moneylosing national mortgage bank will be restructured he said 
notwithstanding the opposition of employees who fear cuts in wages 
and benefits 
marginal fields operated by the state oil company ypf will be 
leased to foreign companies gonzalez said a move that might yield 
500 million in investment 
import tariffs will be lowered for selected food and 
pharmaceutical products whose prices have skyrocketed as local 
businessmen hiked prices with the dollar instead of inflation or 
actual costs he said 
federal subsidies to provinces and private companies such as 
tax benefits related to industrial development will be suspended 
he said and public companies like the railroad will have to 
operate on the revenue they collect 
the menem government has been beset by economic woes since he 
took office last july inflation that month was 197 percent by the 
end of the year the gross domestic product had fallen by nearly 8 
percent and an estimated one of every five workers was under or 
unemployed 
although endorsed by organized unions during the campaign menem 
implemented antilabor policies of public service rate hikes price 
increases ahead of wages budget austerity he freed controls on 
wages prices and foreign exchange and lowered import tariffs 
the moves were designed to narrow the fiscal deficit that 
analysts put at a minimum 10 percent of the gross national product 
of approximately 70 billion 
the 59yearold attorney and former provincial governor said he 
had no choice foreign banks wont lend to argentina nor will 
argentines except at extremely high rates of interest and printing 
money converted a decadelong problem with inflation into 
hyperinflation that soared by 8164 percent during the past 12 
months 
policies of austerity have brought menem criticism from leftist 
parties who campaigned for him and from a growing number of 
dissidents within his own peronist party who believe the state 
should maintain its key role in the economy 
the plan lacks confidence credibility and efficiency a 
leader of the opposition civic radical union leopoldo moreau said 
saturday

president bushs commission on 
aviation security and terrorism laid a wreath of red white and 
blue flowers sunday in memory of the victims of the pan am flight 
103 bombing 
commission chairman ann mclaughlin later told a news conference 
the likelihood of such a bombing occurring again was reduced by 
advances made in security following the disaster dec 21 1988 
the seven commissioners laid the wreath in an area of this small 
scottish town where debris from the boeing 747 destroyed municipal 
housing 
they then went to the windswept dryfesdale cemetery where a 
permanent marble memorial has been dedicated to the 270 people 
killed when the airplane exploded all 259 on the plane and 11 on 
the ground 
mrs mclaughlin placed the wreath next to a lacrosse stick left 
by a visiting team from syracuse university many students enrolled 
in the universitys study abroad program were among those killed 
she told reporters later i would suggest the terrorists are 
not winning if security is good and getting better there are 
still problems but the probablity of attack has been reduced 
since lockerbie because of technical advances and human resource 
nothing spoke so loudly as the silence of some of the pan am 
impact sites here this makes us ever more determined that the 
people responsible for murdering men women and children at 31000 
feet above this community are brought to justice 
during their fourday stay commission members met with 
transport security cecil parkinson and security officials at 
londons heathrow airport 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt but passengers and baggage 
were transferred to a larger plane at heathrow for the new 
yorkbound flight 
the commission also visited west germany and france to consult 
airline government and security officials

friends including a man from his old army unit the 503rd

germany but didnt get out until after the berlin wall came down 
last year 
military police arrested him when he arrived in omaha on jan 30 
with his 12yearold son frankie shocking relatives whod come to 
the airport to welcome him home a week later he was granted an 
otherthanhonorable discharge 
in 1960 pvt kephart fled his army unit in west germany for

crashing an army truck 
his letters didnt reach his family until about a year after he 
deserted and letters that reached home were censored 
some relatives didnt believe kephart was still alive said a 
niece janice dow of logan who was 10 months old when he

political folklore has it that on election day in 
the windy city the dead miraculously cast ballots and party 
loyalists vote early and often but the citys top election 
official said sunday that the myth isnt true any more 
michael hamblet chairman of the chicago board of election 
commissioners said a new board study shows chicago elections 
appear to be about as honest as elections elsewhere 
we always hear horror stories about ghost votes and people 
casting multiple ballots hamblet said it is my belief that 
presentday chicago elections are probably as clean or cleaner than 
any other jurisdiction 
hamblet says he remembers reading allegations by the us 
attorney in chicago that about 100000 people voted illegally in 
1983 when harold washington was elected mayor 
if that was true it would be pretty startling hamblet 
said i always beleived the figure was grossly inflated 
to find out how many people were casting multiple ballots and 
the number of dead holding on to their voter registration cards 
hamblet authorized elections board investigators to do a computer 
study of voter registrations in the 1989 mayoral election that 
election was won by richard m daley son of late mayor richard j 
daley 
hamblet said the boards computer matching names social 
security numbers and birth dates of voters determined that 28785 
people were registered more than once meaning there could have 
been that many repeat voters 
but when board personnel conducted a followup investigation to 
determine how many of those with duplicate registrations actually 
voted more than once they could find only one repeat voter 
hamblet said 
board officials withheld the name of the repeat voter because 
they contended the voter cast the second ballot inadvertently 
however chicago political consultant don rose says duplicate 
voting isnt the primary issue in chicago elections 
assistance voting where party precinct captains help point out 
selections for voters should be of greater concern of the election 
board rose said he also urged the board to make a concerted 
effort to purge the voter rolls of outdated names 
what they the board does is conduct purges selectively 
rose said the majority of purges take place in the minority 
community to some extent with good reason because mobility there 
is higher but also because it is easier 
hamblet defended the board 
i dont think there is evidence that we arent being 
impartial he said from our standpoint we are doing everything 
we can to make it a fair and impartial purge 
hamblet said that through a variety of means of checking the 
board usually eliminates about 50000 to 100000 people from the 
voter rolls each election 
despite his reservations about the boards efforts rose agrees 
with hamblet that chicagos elections are more honest than in the 
past

statue buried in the eruption of mount vesuvius in 79 ad the 
first such find in 13 years newspapers reported sunday

saturday in the house of the casti amanti near the center of the 
abandoned city il mattino of naples and other papers reprted 
archaeologists said the statue was apparently to be used to 
decorate a fountain in the house but that vesuvius erupted before 
workers had a chance to set it in place experts said traces of 
paint coloring the hair blond and eyebrows black made the find even 
more valuable 
they believe the house of casti amanti was owned by a baker who 
lived on one side and kept a shop on the other

prime minister margaret thatcher said sunday the 
west needs to maintain strong military defenses despite broad 
soviet troop cuts because you never know where a new threat 
might come from 
in a speech to the board of deputies of british jews she also 
said any german unification agreement must respect existing 
european borders 
mrs thatcher said hopefully there will be an opportunity to 
make some reductions in our forces as part of balanced reductions 
by both nato and the warsaw pact 
but we shall not do anything which will put our defense and 
our security at risk nor weaken our capability to undertake 
outofarea tasks and that means that we shall continue to need 
our independent nuclear deterrent as well as strong and 
wellequipped conventional forces 
the united states and soviet union agreed this month to deep 
troop cuts in central europe and poland hungary and 
czechoslovakia are negotiating troop cuts with moscow 
but mrs thatcher said the soviet union will still have vast 
military capabilities and that the west should not become 
complacent and undermine or dismantle institutions such as nato 
if we had had something equivalent to nato in the 1930s we 
should never have had a second world war we shall always have to 
keep adequate defenses because you never know where a new threat 
might come from she said 
one has to bear in mind that 12 countries outside nato and the 
warsaw pact already have ballistic missiles and many more 
could be in a position to acquire nuclear weapons by the end of the 
century 
she said any agreement on german unification must respect 
existing borders in europe and the rights of the four allied 
powers britain france the united states and the soviet union 
she said she hoped a united germany would remain part of nato 
with us troops stationed there with some special arrangements 
for east germany to meet the soviet unions security concerns 
indeed it would be quite reasonable for some soviet troops to 
remain there at least for a transitional period 
the soviet union says it would seek troop reductions in a 
unified germany as well as withdrawal from the north atlantic 
treaty organization 
mrs thatcher said britain supports polands wish to have its 
western border with germany guaranteed by a treaty no peace treaty 
was signed at the end of world war ii so poland has no formal 
guarantees of its border 
poland which was overrun by nazi germany wants a role in 
planned talks among the four allies and east and west germany so it 
can protect its borders 
mrs thatcher also pledged to continue campaigning for jews 
wrongly imprisoned in the soviet union but warned it would be 
unjust if israel settled soviet emigrants in the occupied 
territories 
she renewed her appeal to israel to talk to palestinians about 
elections in the occupied territories

the obscenity conviction of a record 
store owner involving a rap music recording and believed to be the 
first of its kind in the nation is the subject of a new trial 
opening monday 
tommy hammond who was convicted in 1988 of violating this 
citys obscenity ordinance by selling the rap group 2 live crews 
move somethin will be represented by the civil liberties 
union of alabama at his tallapoosa county circuit court trial 
should this conviction stand it will open the doors for 
similar prosecutions around the state the organization said in a 
statement last week 
hammonds conviction marked the first time music was found to be 
legally obscene in the united states the american civil liberties 
union and music industry officials have said 
he was arrested after a woman complained to police about her son 
obtaining a copy of the move somethin cassette at hammonds 
record shop in this city of about 14000 people about 40 miles 
northeast of montgomery 
hammond was convicted in municipal court and fined 500 
under alabama law any conviction before a municipal court judge 
must receive a jury trial at the circuit court level before it can 
be appealed 
hammonds montgomery attorneys robert segall and elizabeth 
johnson contend he is a victim of discriminatory prosecution 
segall said another alexander city record store sold the same 
recording after hammond did but wasnt prosecuted 
police told the judge the other record store owner wasnt 
arrested because he refused to sell the recording to a police 
informant 
ms johnson said sunday night that the case also raises the 
issue of free speech which is guaranteed under the first amendment 
of the us constitution 
the question is whether or not he can sell the tapes to an 
adult she said children do not enter into this case at all 
an attorney for the city daniel brown said last year that 2 
live crew violated alexander citys obscenity laws because the 
groups lyrics provide detailed descriptions of perverse sexual 
acts and sadomasochism 
ms johnson disagreed at the time saying profanity and 
offensive music are not what obscenity is all about you may be 
offended by it but that doesnt make it obscene 
the group records under the miamibased luke skywalker label 
which paid half of hammonds legal fees in the first round of the 
legal fight 
label spokeswoman debbie bennett has said the recordings 
sexually explicit language is intended as humor and is far from 
being obscene

one day the scent wafting through endall 
products co might be a cross between baby powder and citrus 
on another day the tiny western maryland factory might smell 
like bubble gum the scent of a deodorizer sold to freshen the 
holding tanks of portable toilets from coast to coast 
we have the mission of making things smell nice company 
president phil gamerman said as he waved vials of portable toilet 
fragrances under his nose 
if its freshly cleaned and serviced the toilet is likely to 
smell like bubble gum or cherries he said why its a total 
mystery to me its the tradition in that industry they work 
theyre just nice strong scents that cover 
ron gillette managing editor of the monthly magazine sanitary 
maintenance said the more than 12 billion sanitary supply 
distribution and wholesale industry is expanding steadily 
the scents themselves have caught up with the publics desire 
its no longer the killer pine or ammonia smell now we have have 
orange cherry they dont overpower us he said 
in addition to the liquid deodorizing products endall makes 
halfdollarsized discs of heavy blotter paper treated with potent 
drops of various fragrances 
diaper services put the nontoxic sachets in bundles of clean 
diapers businesses buy them for laundry rooms toilets and 
laboratory incubators where smelly cultures grow besides the 
cherry bubblegum and citrusbaby powder scents the sachets are 
made to smell like lemons or candy cinammon hearts 
the company is trying to market the pleasantsmelling discs to 
janitorial services that clean offices they could be used in broom 
closets trash cans offices bathrooms or wherever the air is 
musty or stale 
also with a slight change in packaging were going to put 
sticky patches on the backs so you can slap them under a sink or 
anywhere gamerman said 
in late 1985 gamerman a 45yearold baltimore native trained 
in psychotherapy took over part of the deodorizer business from 
his former partner who peddles pet products and deodorizers for 
pets 
in his first full year of business endall posted 35000 in 
sales last year sales totaled 233000 
theres not a whole lot of financial reward at this point 
gamerman said adding that his goal is to pass 1 million in annual 
sales within two years were operating profitably but we are 
putting everything back into the business as fast as we make it 
besides gamerman endall employs seven others three fulltime 
and two parttime production workers a salesman and teresa smith 
office manager 
the first week i went home from work with headaches my 
husband would say you smell like i dont know what you smell 
like smith said now i dont even notice it 
winter is a slow time for endall 
things dont smell so much in the wintertime gamerman said 
we really work hard on the telephone in florida and southern 
california 
to offset the slowdown gamerman developed the deodorizing discs 
with the sticky backs and is working on a line of janitorial 
cleaning supplies for nationwide distribution 
i look for niche markets he said i look for unique 
twists on a product 
he also is working on a new fragrance spray or sachet that could 
be put inside used luxury cars at car dealerships 
were not talking about a cheap industrialtype fragrance 
were talking about a fine fragrance he said this is going to 
make them smell like ferraris or rollsroyces

japans conservative governing party held on to its 
34yearold majority in parliaments powerful lower house sunday 
but scandals and an unpopular tax may have cost it nearly three 
dozen seats in the closely watched election 
prime minister toshiki kaifu called the preliminary results a 
form of purification for his troubled liberal democratic party 
the secretarygeneral of the main opposition socialist party 
tsuruo yamaguchi disagreed simply being elected does not mean 
one is absolved the socialists made strong gains 
the political outlook was clouded because the opposition holds a 
majority in parliaments upper house making it difficult to pass 
major legislation or deal with trade problems with the united 
states 
the liberal democrats needed at least 257 seats to maintain 
control of the 512seat lower house which chooses the prime 
minister and can pass a budget without assent of the upper house 
with 80 percent of the 66 million ballots counted late sunday 
election officials declared the liberal democrats had won 240 
seats compared with 114 for the socialists the clean government 
party had 31 seats the communist party 13 the democratic 
socialist party 12 the united social democratic party three and 
18 independents were elected 
votes for the remaining 81 seats were to be counted monday 
kyodo news service predicted 271 seats for the liberal 
democrats enough to control all standing committees in the house 
but far short of the 295 they held after the last election in june 
1986 
i think we have defended our majority at least said ichiro 
ozawa secretarygeneral of the party while conceding the loss of 
rural seats where farmers reacted angrily to increased imports of 
agricultural products 
about 73 percent of the 905 million eligible voters a high 
turnout cast ballots the election was seen as a test of whether 
the liberal democrats had recovered from a disastrous year of 
scandals and implementation of an unpopular 3 percent sales tax 
two conservative prime ministers resigned in quick succession 
last year amid sex and money scandals and the socialists popular 
chairwoman takako doi 61 seemed to have a chance to tilt japan 
to the left 
but the conservative japanese voters rejected that bold step 
though the socialists enhanced their standing as the no 1 
opposition party they had 83 seats in the outgoing house 
ms doi refused to concede defeat or comment in detail before 
the final count id like to wait until the results are in in 
hope of good news she said 
yamaguchi the socialist secretarygeneral attributed the 
liberal democrats success to support from big business and large 
contributions from corporations 
at least a dozen liberal democrats won reelection despite being 
linked to last years socalled recruit scandal in which 
influential politicians profited from cutrate stock offered by the 
recruit co conglomerate in return for political favors 
kaifu 59 called the results a significant verdict of the 
people 
it is a form of purification he said 
koshiro ishida chairman of the komeito clean government 
party denounced the results saying there has been no 
purification id like to know how the liberal democrats plan to 
take responsibility for corrupt politics 
the postelection period will be crammed with foreign policy 
issues as well as political work to deal with the legislative 
roadblocks facing the government 
us defense secretary dick cheney is arriving tuesday to ask 
japan to increase its payments supporting the 50000 us troops 
based here on thursday usjapan negotiations resume to seek 
ways to cut deeply into japans 49 billion trade surplus with the 
united states 
those reelected included former prime minister noboru 
takeshita 65 who resigned last year after admitting that he 
accepted huge donations from the recruit co and takeshitas 
replacement sousuke uno 67 who lasted only two months as prime 
minister a former geisha said uno had paid her to be his mistress 
and he resigned after the liberal democrats lost badly in the upper 
house election 
another winner was former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone 72 
who resigned from the party in disgrace last year he ran as an 
independent 
a general election is a judgment by the people and i 
passed said nakasone the recruit scandal erupted after he left 
office in 1987 but the stocksforfavors transactions took place 
while he was prime minister and he was forced to testify to 
parliament about his links to the recruit co 
nakasones reelection may permit him to return to the party and 
greater behindthescenes influence 
former foreign minister shintaro abe 65 seen as a likely 
successor to kaifu also won reelection despite recruit links that 
forced him to step down as party secretary general a post that 
often is a stepping stone to the prime ministers office 
the only recruitlinked candidate who lost was kunio takaishi a 
former vice minister of education who is under indictment for 
bribery late sunday police arrested one of his private 
secretaries on charges of handing out cash to voters 
voters commends indicated a wariness of handing power to the 
socialists 
 
takashi aida 40 and selfemployed said he voted for the 
socialists in last summers election for the less powerful upper 
house but voted for a liberal democrat on sunday 
it is different this time because we are voting for the lower 
house opposition parties wouldnt be able to handle politics 
in the lower house he said 
a 31yearold doctor said he was no liberal democratic party 
supporter but i just had to choose them because nobody else is 
capable
