federal agents sunday arrested a 
religious cult leader wanted in the slayings of a family of five 
and seized numerous weapons including an ar15 assault rifle 
authorities said 
jeffrey lundgren 39 a former sunday school teacher and tour 
guide in the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day 
saints in ohio was arrested outside a motel by agents of the 
federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and members of the 
san diego sheriffs department 
also arrested were his wife alice lundgren and their 
19yearold son damon three other lundgren children kristen 
10 caleb 9 and jason 15 were taken into protective custody 
said andrew vita special agent in charge of the atf office in los 
angeles 
police had the motel in this bluecollar town near the mexican 
border under surveillance since saturday night said george 
rodriguez a special agent for the atf in kansas city 
we wanted to make sure they didnt get to mexico rodriguez 
said 
authorities were led to the motel by telephone calls made from a 
pay phone to another location they had under surveillance said 
steven c latourette a lake county ohio prosecutor who held a 
news conference in painesville ohio earlier sunday 
officials said lundgren broke away from the reorganized church 
and persuaded other members to follow him the group once lived on 
a 15acre farm near kirtland ohio where investigators last week 
unearthed five bodies which authorities believe to be those of 
dennis avery his wife cheryl and their three children 
in a statement issued in washington atf officials said 
investigators had been searching for lundgren and the others since 
thursday and made the arrests without incident 
more than 20 atf agents and sheriffs deputies participated in 
the arrests at the santa fe motel located on a busy intersection 
in national city which is about 10 miles south of san diego 
motel manager steve liu said mrs lundgren checked in wednesday 
night with the three children paying cash for the room for six 
nights 
mrs lundgren told liu she was checking into the motel because 
she had argued with her husband 
she said she had wanted to stay in a hotel for a couple of 
days so maybe things would cool off liu said i saw him 
lundgren coming back and forth during the last few days and i 
thought maybe they were making up 
vita said agents raided the motel room sunday morning and seized 
the ar15 three handguns an assortment of hunting knives and 
camping and survival gear 
authorities also searched a storage locker that lundgren had 
rented near the motel three more handguns and some smokeless 
powder used for reloading ammunition was found vita said 
the lundgrens apparently were trying to make contact with 
relatives they could leave the children with police said 
the lundgrens were being held in the san diego county jail 
pending extradition to ohio where they face charges including 
aggravated murder complicity to murder and kidnapping they were 
to appear in court monday for a hearing 
investigators said the averys were shot and killed in midapril 
and buried in a common grave in the barn near kirtland one day 
before lundgren and his followers left ohio for a farm near holden 
mo 
lundgren and 12 of his followers were indicted by a lake county 
grand jury in the killings 
in addition to being shot the victims eyes were covered with 
duct tape and some had their hands and feet bound with the tape 
dale luffman president of the northeast ohio chapter of the 
reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints said he 
did not believe the slayings were part of a sacrifice but probably 
resulted from a dispute over money sex or fear the family would 
leave the cult 
latourette said friday the avery family apparently was killed in 
a sacrifice necessary under a prophecy of lundgrens before the 
cult could relocate to the wilderness 
lundgren worked with the churchs historic temple in kirtland 
established in 1836 by joseph smith founder of the mormon church 
lundgren was a guide in the temple giving tours to visitors 
starting in 1985 when he moved to kirtland about 30 miles east of 
cleveland from independence mo where the church is based 
he was stripped of his credentials as a lay minister with the 
church in 1987 after he began preaching radical doctrines during 
church tours he and others who followed him left the church and 
eventually settled on the farm near kirtland 
though it has roots and some beliefs in common with the mormon 
church the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints 
is a separate church

logan himself lives about four miles from his perimeter center 
office in a fourbedroom house on a half acre in the quiet 
community of sandy springs when asked about his commute he can 
barely contain his smugness 
ten minutes each way unless theres traffic he allows 
then maybe 15 i never have to get on the freeway 
three thousand miles away sociologist mark gottdiener stands on 
a desert hill looking down at what he calls the beast moreno 
valley calif one of the nations fastest growing communities 
this is the suburban frontier 70 miles east of la ten years 
ago he says there was nothing down there but rattlesnakes 
coyotes and sagebrush today there are 105000 people about 
1000 new ones move in a month and four or five schools open each 
year 
but the principles on which moreno valley was developed are 
wellestablished leapfrog beyond the urban fringe where land is 
cheaper and build 1000 houses rather than 10 that was the 
lesson of levittown says gottdiener you can go anywhere and 
produce an instant city you can plunk it in the middle of 
nowhere 
what you get is the ultimate commuters community since there 
are few good jobs in moreno valley itself but those who can afford 
less than 160000 for a home are drawn here despite the long 
commutes to jobs in los angeles or orange county 
when bill hampson pastor of a local church asks people why 
they dont go to church on sunday the most common answer is 
commuting he says a lot of people drive 100 miles a day and 
the weekend is literally their only free time 
baby sitters advertise commuter hours from 4 am until 7 
pm and there are brisk sales in commuter paraphernalia such as 
books on tape and dashboard coffee mugs 
someday however moreno valley will have its own factories and 
office buildings and already some people are complaining that it 
is becoming too congested already for sale signs are posted 
on farmland in the towns further east past the san andreas fault 
for all their differences suburbs like perimeter center and 
moreno valley share one striking trait an isolation from and 
frequently an antagonism toward their central cities 
for the first time a generation of suburban americans lacks an 
emotional tie to the city a feel for its lifestyle and an 
interest or stake in helping solve its vast problems 
levittown for instance began as an appendage of new york city 
most of its residents came from there had relatives there and 
worked there but today most levittowners work on long island and 
spend almost all their time there to them the city means 
congestion and above all danger despite an increase in suburban 
crime someone in new york city is about eight times more likely to 
be a robbery victim than someone on long island 
the young people now dont really care about the city or even 
go there very often says claire worthing who used to drive into 
the city on weekends for shows at the apollo theater in harlem 
they just go to the malls

deane hinton took over as the new 
us ambassador to panama saturday and pledged american cooperation 
when panamanians take full operational control of the panama canal 
also saturday former us attorney general ramsey clark said 
the death toll from us invasion of panama is higher than has been 
reported clark estimated at least 4000 had died and called the 
reported toll an official conspiracy of silence 
us panamanian and hospital sources say at least 500 civilians 
are believed to have died in the operation to oust gen manuel 
antonio noriega and bring him to the united states for trial on 
drug trafficking charges 
clark who is gathering information about human rights 
violations did not say how he arrived at his figure of 4000 nor 
did he give any other details 
there is a strong motive for not counting the dead humanity 
should pay attention to this point clark said at a news 
conference he did not elaborate 
hinton in an arrival statement said let us not look back to 
a troubled past but rather let us responsibly face the future 
together let panamanians and americans build our relations on a 
basis of mutual respect and enduring friendship 
let me stress that panamanians and americans must henceforth 
cooperate to prepare for the day less than 10 years away for 
panamanian operation of the panama canal hinton said 
treaties signed by thenpresident jimmy carter and panamanian 
gen omar torrijos in 1977 gave full ownership to panama of the 
waterway which the united states built and inaugurated in 1913 
the agreement put control of its operation under a joint 
uspanamanian commission until the year 2000 when it reverts 
completely to panama 
noriega has claimed the united states sought his ouster in order 
to renege on the treaties 
but the bush administration repeatedly insisted it did not want 
to retain control of the waterway only to get noriega to stand 
trial in the united states for drug trafficking and money 
laundering 
the ecumenical committee of panama said in a statement saturday 
that the us government should repair the damage caused by the 
assault 
it asked that the united states accept its responsibility to 
repair the damage from the invasion 
the appointment of hinton an experienced career diplomat was 
seen as another effort by the bush administration to reconstruct 
the extensive damage caused by the fighting between us troops and 
soldiers loyal to noriega and six years of harsh noriega rule 
hinton 67 a former ambassador to el salvador and pakistan 
replaces arthur davis 
he pledged to do all he could to help new president guillermo 
endara and his government fulfill the aspirations of the 
panamanian people for equitable social and economic development and 
for the benefits of participatory democracy respect for human 
rights and the rule of law 
panama he said has a philosophical commitment to the free 
enterprise system and it has demonstrated a firm commitment to the 
establishment of democratic institutions and the carrying out of 
democratic principles

about 200 chinese students and a 
california lawmaker met at harvard university on saturday to 
organize opposition to president bushs veto of legislation 
protecting chinese from deportation 
rep nancy pelosi dcalif the bills sponsor encouraged 
students to pressure federal legislators to override the veto 
the measure which received overwhelming support in congress 
would prevent the immigration and naturalization service from 
forcing chinese students to return to their homeland after their 
student visas expire 
bush argued that a presidential directive would serve the same 
function as the bill pelosi said however that a directive was 
not as strong as an executive order and can be withdrawn whenever 
the president pleases 
zhao haiching chairman of the national committee on chinese 
student affairs said white house officials had told him the veto 
was necessary to give the president flexibility in foreign policy 
what does the administration mean by flexible we dont want 
to be flexible with our lives he said 
aides to three other federal lawmakers joined pelosi and the 
students on the first full day of threeday meeting sponsored by 
the national committee on chinese student affairs and the harvard 
chinese student association 
student leaders estimate that 40000 chinese students who 
supported the prodemocracy movement in china by faxing information 
from us sources to china during the revolt would be affected by 
the bill 
students said they were distrustful that bushs directive would 
be maintained in part because of recent secret visits to china by 
national security adviser brent scowcroft and other high 
administration officials 
pelosi encouraged the students to pressure congress by making 
their case in both chambers in the media and to the american 
people a twothirds vote is required in both the house and senate 
to override a presidential veto 
president bush is wrong to try to cozy up to the leaders in 
beijing who ordered the massacre last june in tiananmen square 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said in a statement delivered to 
the group 
we must do everything possible to ensure that these brave 
students do not become pawns or bargaining chips in the 
administrations future dealings with that repressive regime 
kennedy said

mount st helens belched volcanic ash that settled over a 
southcentral washington community saturday while seismic 
equipment detected a small explosion in alaskas redoubt volcano 
that prompted flight restrictions 
the national weather service reported a light dusting of ash 
south of yakima wash in the toppenish area about 80 miles east 
of mount st helens 
it was gritty and it was still falling out of the sky said 
david foster of toppenish who found his two cars coated with dust 
when he awoke saturday morning it was very fine you could see 
tracks in the street 
steve malone a seismologist with the university of washington 
in seattle said seismographs and other equipment within the crater 
of mount st helens recorded a small eruption at 537 am pst 
the eruption lasted about two minutes and was followed by small 
earthquakes that lasted about two hours 
in alaska authorities had no visual confirmation that redoubt 
volcano emitted ash during a small explosive event at 226 am 
ast the alaska volcano observatory said 
seismologist john davies of the observatory in fairbanks called 
the eruption a clearly a minor event compared to eruptions last 
month and tuesday 
but scientists said that during the day the volcano continued to 
generate a vigorous plume of steam and volcanic gas to 
altitudes of 12000 to 15000 feet 
the federal aviation administration prohibited air traffic at 
altitudes of less than 60000 feet within 20 miles of the volcano 
the volcano 115 miles southwest of anchorage rumbled awake in 
middecember after a 25year silence spewing ash that disrupted 
air traffic 
an eruption tuesday stronger than the ones in december 
prompted precautionary flight cancellations and delays at anchorage 
international airport 
malone said further details on the mount st helens eruption 
would not be available until crews could take a closer look at the 
readings the activity doesnt necessarily mean the volcano is 
going to become more active he said 
mount st helens erupted may 18 1980 leveling 230 square 
miles leaving 57 people dead or missing and creating an ash cloud 
that circled the globe 
the volcano has had a number of less intense eruptions since 
then but has been relatively quiet in recent years

mobil oil corp abruptly gave up its fight 
this week to keep sealed confidential environmental reports sought 
by a fired employee who is suing the company 
mobil said it dropped its appeal of an unsealing order to speed 
the 2yearold case along and to put to rest what it called 
recent unjustified speculation in the media that it was trying 
to hide wrongdoing 
the papers themselves several dozen environmental assessment 
reports on mobils chemical plants and attorney comments about 
them shed little new light on arguments already made by attorneys 
for the dismissed employee valcar bowman jr of riverdale ga 
bowman then based in princeton was fired in april 1986 as 
mobil chemical cos no 2 environmental official mobil said he 
was fired in an economic cutback bowman 47 says it was because 
he refused to go along with a coverup of environmental problems 
an allegation mobil denies 
mobil opposed an effort by attorneys for bowman and the 
associated press which us district judge harold a ackerman 
allowed to enter the case to have the docuents unsealed he 
unsealed the papers and mobil appealed to the 3rd us circuit 
court of appeals the company withdrew that appeal thursday 
company attorney ron neill said mobil fought as hard as it to 
uphold the principle behind the environmental protection agencys 
policy of critical selfassessment in which industries police 
themselves when regulators cant 
if these documents arent afforded some privacy people 
are going to be disinclined to do them if the local newspaper is 
going to splash them on the front page said neill it was 
public interest 
the promise of secrecy was used as an incentive to recruit 
companies to make such reports said lee m thomas who was epa 
administrator when the policy was set forth in the mid80s 
but when news reports about bowmans case and the struggle over 
the documents disclosure came to light mobils need to defuse 
the myth that we were trying to conceal something held sway 
neill said 
to first amendment lawyers it was an important victory 
if mobil won it would have created a new class of evidence 
shielded from public scrutiny said thomas cafferty an attorney 
for the new jersey press association 
this is a very limited and discreet intrusion into the 
selfcritical process he said a court decision allowing the 
documents to be kept sealed he said would have been a serious 
departure from the principle that evidence introduced in a public 
court proceeding is part of the public domain 
thomas said such reports should be released only in tightly 
controlled situations 
this may be one of them he said but added he couldnt tell 
if their release in the mobil case would have a chilling effect 
as for the papers themselves they dont go much beyond excerpts 
contained in bowmans court briefs which have been reported on 
previously 
the briefs quote a mobil attorneys memo spotlighting 
admissions of noncompliance of environmental regulations and 
how mobil executives could be subjected to potential legal action 
if they knew about them

the aircraft carrier john f kennedy has been 
chosen to lead an antidrug interdiction effort off the coast of 
colombia but final decisions about when the warship may be put to 
work havent been made yet a defense department source said 
saturday 
the carrier and an accompanying guided missile cruiser the uss 
virginia left norfolk va on thursday to engage in routine 
training exercises in the atlantic a pentagon official said but 
he added that a question mark remained as to when and if the 
warships would see duty in a proposed uscolombian antidrug 
interdiction effort 
thats the group the jfk is the one to be used said the 
official but its still a question when theyd be put to use 
two colombian radio networks caracol and rcn on saturday 
quoted unnamed pentagon sources as saying the ships were headed 
toward colombia to begin setting up a blockade to try to stop drug 
smugglers 
but the pentagon official speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said the final plans were still being worked out on a 
pentagon proposal to launch a virtual air and sea blockade of the 
colombian coastline as part of an effort to help colombia curb the 
illicit narcotics exports of its drug cartels 
an administration us official saturday denied that any 
blockade was under way 
nothings been initiated in terms of activating such 
efforts he said 
we are consulting with the colombians and will continue to 
do so over the next few days the administration official said he 
declined to say when the heightened military operation might begin 
and said it should not be called a blockade 
in bogota colombia the us embassy said the operation being 
contemplated is only an increase in what has been done in the 
past 
all operations will be conducted in international waters far 
from the colombian coast the embassy said contacts with boats 
and planes will follow norms dictated by international laws and 
practices 
formal consulation has not been carried out with the colombian 
government yet but the least that we want to do is establish 
communications in order to prevent incidents and if possible 
share information that is obtained in the operations the embassy 
statement said 
the new york times in its sunday additions said us officials 
had planned to announce details of the drug plans earlier but that 
colombian authorities refused this past week to meet with an 
american team that had been sent to explain the navy plan 
administration officials said however that they are confident 
colombian president virgilio barco vargas will cooperate with the 
us plan 
quoting an unidentified administration official speaking on 
condition of anonymity the times reported that the colombians 
feared that the united states might use its panama operation as a 
precedent to enter other countries in pursuit of people wanted on 
american drug trafficking charges 
the official also said that earlier reports about the dispatch 
of a nval force to colombia had been misinterepreted by the 
colombians as suggesting the united states planned a blockade 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said us ships had been 
scheduled to sail to colombia to help with the antidrug effort 
but she did not know when or have any more details on the operation 
we knew the boats were going down there glen said 
later glen said she had been mistaken and had since learned 
that it was not definite ships would go to colombia but only that 
they were on a routine operations in the atlantic 
defense secretary dick cheney is expected soon to announce a 
white houseapproved plan for getting us military forces more 
deeply involved in the international drug battle 
president bush is scheduled to travel to colombia in february 
for an antidrug summit of the leaders of the andean nations 
a senior defense department official said last month the air and 
sea effort was expected to be enacted prior to bushs trip to 
colombia 
after that report appeared white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater acknowledged that final plans were being made 
under the reported antidrug effort the navy was to operate an 
aircraft carrier battle group off the caribbean coast of colombia 
on a rotating basis each carrier group would be in position for 
one or two months a time frame similar to normal training 
deployments 
the senior pentagon official had said that much of the money for 
operating the battle group would come from training funds 
the pentagon official also emphasized that us navy fighters 
would not be given the authority to shoot down suspected 
drugrunning planes that enforcement role he said was to be 
handled by colombian officials 
an aircraft carrier normally has eight or 12 smaller ships as 
part of its battle group along with an aircraft wing composed of 
about 3000 men and dozens of observation and tracking planes and 
those would be in the forefront of the surveillance efforts 
pentagon officials long have said the hightech radar and 
surveillance equipment owned by the us navy would be their main 
weapon in keeping tabs on suspected drug dealers boats and planes

khmer rouge guerrillas claimed sunday 
they had attacked cambodias secondlargest city setting it ablaze 
and forcing government troops to call for reinforcements 
if confirmed the reported battle for the provincial capital of 
battambang would one of the biggest clashes in the 11yearold war 
against the vietnameseinstalled government most claims by the 
communist khmer rouge have proven false in the past although the 
guerrillas have scored significant victories in recent months 
khmer rouge army radio claimed the guerrillas hit the 
northwestern city at midnight friday noon friday est attacking 
the 5th military regions command there and in western pursat 
province and northwestern banteay meanchey province 
the bek chan airfield was among the targets reported hit in 
battambang 
the radio claimed battambang town burned brightly from 1 
am saturday and the fire was still raging at dawn 
at 6 am saturday we were still fighting throughout 
battambang town particularly in the strategic places it said 
the vietnamese enemy and puppets panicked and called tanks 
from route 10 for assistance the radio said route 10 is the 
main road from pailin to battambang town 
however the guerrillas attacked and kept pressure on the enemy 
forces along route 10 since they partly routed them from thursday 
morning the radio said 
battambang the secondlargest city after the national capital 
of phnom penh is in the province of the same name the province 
borders thailand and contains some of the key mountain strongholds

the attack would be the most significant since the guerrillas 
seized the rich gemmining town of pailin 45 miles southwest of 
battambang on oct 22 after weeks of intense battle 
the guerrillas had said the capture of pailin opened the way for 
an attack on battambang and called on government supporters to 
surrender or face the prospect of death in a guerrilla attack

the us embassy in bogota released a statement in response to 
the colombian radio reports saying the united states is stepping 
up air and sea patrols in the caribbean in an attempt to block 
cocaine smuggling 
but the embassy statement also did not say when the operation 
was to start

from the colombian coast the embassy said contacts with boats 
and planes will follow norms dictated by international laws and 
practices it did not say how many ships and planes were involved 
the radio networks caracol and rcn in reports from stringer 
reporters quoted unidentified pentagon sources as saying the 
kennedy and the cruiser virginia were headed for colombias 
caribbean coast to begin setting up a blockade 
caracol and rcn did not not give any details of their sources 
at the pentagon information officer chris cimko confirmed the 
kennedy and the virginia sailed thursday from their home port in

south korean jetliner to fly over its territory after a volcanic 
eruption in alaska prevented the plane from taking the north pole 
route to paris officials said 
it was the first time a regular korean air flight was allowed to 
pass through soviet airspace en route to europe

the soviet union which recognizes communist north korea has no 
diplomatic relations with capitalist south korea but moscow and 
seoul have recently expanded economic and other nonpolitical 
contacts in recent years and early last month the two governments 
established a de facto consular relationship 
korean air officials said the soviet permission for the flight 
was temporary but said they would be allowed to use the soviet 
route regularly after the conclusion of an aviation agreement with 
moscow in the first half of this year 
if the aviation agreement is signed korean air and the soviet 
airline aeroflot would be able to open regular passenger service 
between their two capitals the officials said 
at initial talks aeroflot indicated that it would start a 
weekly flight to seoul by way of beijing and shanghai korean air 
plans to fly all of its nine weekly flights to europe by way of the 
soviet union with one flight each stopping over in moscow and 
khabarovsk respectively

panamanian investigators are preparing more 
than 300 corruption cases against officials of the deposed regime 
whose take may have amounted to onefifth of panamas national 
budget a newspaper reported 
officials with the new civilian government say documents of the 
government run by deposed gen manuel antonio noriega indicated 20 
percent of the budget went to pay political employees who never 
worked the los angeles times reported sunday 
along with padding payrolls former municipal authorities are 
being investigated for illegal procurement and other embezzlement 
schemes the paper said quoting officials who spoke on condition 
of anonymity investigations also are underway in 12 ministries of 
the federal government including the finance and justice 
ministries officials for those agencies said 
three hundred criminal cases being prepared by panamanian 
authorities are based on evidence gathered by the office of 
controller general ruben carles panamas chief fiscal 
investigator and sent to the attorney general the paper said 
the public administration of the noriega regime was based only 
on seeing how much they could steal and what they stole was 
incredible panama city mayor guillermo cochez said 
cochez said his staff has identified and fired employees who 
served in noriegas paramilitary dignity battalions officials also 
are hunting phantom workers the noshow cronies who regularly 
received government paychecks 
but corruption prosecutions are hindered by the sabotage of 
supreme court records by noriega loyalists early during fighting in 
the capital on dec 21 the paper said 
court employees told investigators they saw several supreme 
court magistrates setting their own files afire a blaze swept 
through the court offices at the justice ministry destroying most 
of the case records 
computers photocopiers fax machines and filing cabinets were 
methodically smashed with axes and iron bars other federal 
agencies were similarly sabotaged before they were secured by us 
forces 
after the us invasion dec 20 about 40 tons of files were 
captured and taken to us military bases in panama for analysis by 
the cia and the us drug enforcement administration 
officials in the controller generals office said half the cases 
they have received had been shelved by the noriega regime

a man convicted of murder says he would 
rather be put to death than spend his life in prison 
but the criminal is not likely to get his wish in belgium which 
has not carried out an execution since 1950 
willy de coene 42 was sentenced to death after being convicted 
in december of murdering a 71yearold woman in 1986 death 
sentences are automatically reduced to life in prison in belgium 
and that will probably happen in coenes case his lawyer and legal 
experts say 
i am waiting impatiently for my execution coene said in an 
open letter that appeared in several weekend newspapers even 
though he denies killing the woman he said asking for mercy is 
only for cowards 
a death penalty law dating back to 1867 is still on the books in 
belgium but a longstanding legal tradition makes life in prison 
the maximum penalty 
several proposals to change the death penalty law which is part 
of a broad code of moral standards have failed

us ambassador donald gregg met 
sunday with citizens of kwangju in an apparent effort to reduce 
antiamerican sentiment in the city scene of a 1980 civil uprising 
that left hundreds dead 
gregg who assumed his post last year was the first us 
ambassador to visit kwangju since the 10day uprising 
many kwangju citizens believe washington played a role in the 
bloody incident by condoning the use of the korean military to 
suppress the uprising about 200 people died and more than 1500 
were wounded 
washington repeatedly denied the allegations but greggs two 
immediate predecessors james lilley and richard walker stayed 
away from the city for fear of antiamerican violence 
on sunday gregg had a dinner with dozens of leading citizens 
including mayor choi inki at a downtown restaurant he planned to 
meet with dissident and student leaders before returning to seoul 
on tuesday 
the south korean news agency yonhap quoted gregg as describing 
his trip to kwangju as routine and nothing special and reported 
that the ambassador was expected to try to explain washingtons 
position on the 1980 incident 
gregg also expressed hope that the us cultural center in the 
city closed last year would be reopened at a new location before 
the end of this year yonhap said 
the us cultural center in kwangju has been attacked by radical 
students 28 times times since 1980 
greggs visit came two days after the us embassy issued a 
statement rejecting former korean president chun doohwans 
reference to an alleged us role in the kwangju incident 
dissident groups contend the united states supported chuns 
military dictatorship and condoned the mobilization of soldiers to 
put down the prodemocracy uprising in kwangju 
chun said in the testimony that he then an army general 
decided on the military suppression of the uprising after receiving 
information from the united states that the military threat from 
communist north korea was increasing 
the us embassy said the united states did not see any evidence 
of heightened threat from north korea at the time

president corazon aquino on sunday 
announced a new law substantially expanding the powers of a 
presidential commission investigating the december coup attempt 
mrs aquino said the powers of the commission include the right 
among other things to look into the bank accounts of supporters of 
the failed coup the most serious of the six attempts made to oust 
mrs aquino 
this measure is a sign of our firm resolve to expose and 
punish the guilty pecially if they conspired after being bought 
off with 30 pieces of silver mrs aquino said in her weekly 
radio program 
about 3000 soldiers launched the coup attempt dec 1 at least 
113 people were killed and more than 500 others were injured in 
fighting that lasted until dec 9 
it was the sixth attempt to overthrow mrs aquino since she came 
to power in a militarycivilian uprising in 1986 her opponents 
have accused her of not acting strongly enough to put down a 
longrunning communist insurgency and not doing enough to improve 
the nations economy 
the law which was signed friday but not made public until 
sunday gives the fivemember commission quasijudicial powers 
including the right to grant immunity from prosecution to witnesses 
it also protects witnesses from selfincrimination in testimony 
they are forced to give 
the commission can require the monetary board to disclose 
information or grant authority to examine bank accounts if it has 
reasonable ground to believe the funds were used in the coup 
attempt 
the law provides that the commissions work which must be 
completed in one year cannot be hampered by court injunctions 
except those issued by the supreme court 
the congress in december granted mrs aquino emergency powers to 
deal with remnants of the rebel forces and economic saboteurs 
using the powers mrs aquino last week ordered new registration 
for all firearms in a bid to flush out weapons used by rebel 
soldiers and their civilian supporters

for 11 months mircea raceanu spent 
most of his time alone in a small cell at a bucharest prison 
waiting for a firing squad 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu branded raceanu a traitor 
a military tribunal sentenced him to death and an appeals court 
confirmed the sentence 
raceanu a career diplomat who was the no 2 man on the us 
desk at the foreign ministry was arrested jan 31 1989 and 
accused of passing secrets to a foreign power his case shows 
what happened to people who challenged or defied ceausescu 
the secret allegedly passed to us diplomats in bucharest was a 
copy of a letter to ceausescu from six top romanian communists 
demanding improved human rights and an immediate halt to food 
exports in the shortageplagued country 
i was sentenced to death by the ceausescu regime on charges of 
betraying the interests of the country raceanu said in an 
interview 
i opposed the ceausescu regime but i never betrayed my 
country insisted raceanu who refused to list specifics of the 
charges against him 
i always made a clear distinction between what is romania and 
romanian interests and what represented the dictator and his 
interests and his regimes interests raceanu said 
in other words it was very clear in my mind that romania is 
romania and not like ceausescu always wanted to say that romania 
is ceausescu and ceausescu is romania 
raceanu without commenting on whether he passed it on said the 
letter of the six as it is now called helped lay a foundation 
for the start of a movement against ceausescu 
it marked the first time that six senior communists including 
raceanus father grigore ion were known to have banded together 
to protest ceausescus tough policies it hinted at even further 
dissatisfaction within the communist party 
the letter criticized ceausescu for plans to destroy thousands 
of villages and for damaging romanias economy and reputation 
abroad 
you started changing the geography of the countryside but you 
cannot remove romania to africa the six wrote in the letter 
alluding to romanias increasing isolation 
how are you going to improve romanias external relations when 
all the leaders of the noncommunist nations of europe refuse to 
meet you the six wrote 
the letter was signed by former politburo members gheorghe 
apostol and alexan ru birladeanu former foreign minister corneliu 
manescu former ambassador to the united states and editor of the 
party daily silviu brucan and party veterans constantin parvulescu 
and raceanus father 
before his arrest raceanu said he had spent 30 years in the 
romanian diplomatic service he was in romanias embassy in 
washington from 1969 to 1978 
i opposed ceausescu and ceausescus policies and as the 
former dictator said to a distinguished american public figure who 
intervened on my behalf i betrayed him personally said raceanu 
who added he could not identify the american 
raceanu was saved by the revolution that ousted ceausescu on 
dec 22 and freed political prisoners the next day 
another military tribunal tried ceausescu and his wife elena 
his second in command they were executed christmas day the 
provisional government said they will be the last people executed 
in romania 
it is because of the young generation who paid with their own 
lives that we came to the point were we could get rid of this 
terrible cruel horrifying dictator and his group raceanu said 
by their action the young generation showed not only their 
courage and dignity but proved once again the vitality of the 
romanian people in a historic moment 
romanians from all generations should pay tribute to these 
young people and they should do everything to ensure that their 
sacrifice is never forgotten as a man who was on death row i 
personally would like to pay respect to this young generation 
among them my daughter of 20 years i am proud of them 
raceanu said life in romania went from bad to worse under 
ceausescu conditions were harsh and food was scarce 
there was a unique concentration of power in the hands of one 
family supported by a group of people who had transformed romania 
into their own house and garden neglecting the interest of the 
people and romania as a country he said 
internally it was a hell for the people there was no hope 
for anybody especially for the younger generation on the 
international scene romania became an isolated country pointed to 
by almost everybody as a model which should never be followed by 
any civilized member of the international community

black students and their parents 
sunday demanded nullification of high school exams that 58 percent 
of black students failed and they urged the failing youths to 
reenroll in defiance of government rules 
these were two of the major steps endorsed at an unprecedented 
community meeting attended by more than 1000 people in soweto the 
countrys largest black township and one of the hardest hit by the 
crisis in black education 
nationally only 42 percent of more than 190000 black high 
school seniors passed standardized exams late last year compared 
to more than 95 percent of white students at high schools in 
soweto home to 25 million blacks the passing rate was less than 
30 percent 
a student who passes the exams gets a certificate comparable to 
a high school diploma in the united states those who fail have 
little chance of getting any sort of job beyond the equivalent of 
manual labor 
the exams also are used for university admissions purposes 
only 17533 of the more than 190000 black students who took the 
recent exams did well enough to qualify for universities 
the meeting sunday was organized by antiapartheid activists 
specializing in education issues some of whom have spent long 
periods in detention the chairman vusi khanilye was one of three 
activists who won his freedom by escaping to refuge at the us 
consulate in johannesburg in 1988 
most speakers in the crowded auditorium blamed the 
whitecontrolled department of education and training for causing 
the school crisis through overcrowding underfunding and lack of 
commitment to black progress the government spends five times as 
much to educate a white pupil as a black pupil 
however some participants said black students and political 
activists shared the blame one teacher said students could have 
studied harder and a parent said antiapartheid groups were wrong 
to have encouraged students to join politically oriented general 
strikes and boycotts that frequently disrupted schooling over the 
past five years 
one youth representing a militant student organization said 
we charge the whole community to take the responsibility of 
getting involved and to take control of our schools addressing 
students the youth said go back to your battle trenches which 
are the schools themselves 
black schools reopen this week for the new academic year and 
people at the meeting agreed that students who failed the exams 
should present themselves for enrollment 
the government says there is not enough room to accommodate the 
failed students and has advised them to attend parttime 
finishing schools 
you say no to one child and you say no to a nation said 
david maepa a parent who helped conduct the meeting we will 
meet the governments challenge and take all our children back to 
school even if they sit on top of each other 
the countrys largestcirculation black newspaper city press 
said in an editorial sunday that the education meeting was one of 
the most important for soweto in several years 
we are glad some of our leaders have finally come of age it 
said they realize education is the only real weapon at our 
disposal

a moderate earthquake was felt widely 
around fairbanks early sunday morning but no damage or injuries 
were reported 
alex medberry at the tsunami warning center in palmer said the 2 
am quake was centered 40 miles northwest of here 
charlotte row of the alaska earthquake information center placed 
the richter scale reading at 5 and said said several small 
aftershocks followed an earlier estimate put the richter scale 
reading at 55 
the quake was felt in the small towns surrounding fairbanks and 
as far away as clear 80 miles south she said 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in a local area 4 can cause moderate damage 5 considerable 
damage and 6 can be severe

the trident submarine program is sailing into 
rough seas in 1990 with the pentagon considering halving the 
production rate and congressional critics poised to divert its 
funding into a peace dividend 
a key element in the nations threepronged nuclear defense 
system each submarine armed with 192 nuclear warheads costs 12 
billion money that critics contend could be spent on domestic 
programs or on reducing the federal deficit 
opponents argue that the 17 tridents already in the water or 
under construction are enough to hold up the seagoing leg of the 
nuclear triad of missiles bombers and submarines those arguments 
are expected to return to congress with renewed energy at the end 
of january when the debate on next years federal budget begins 
i would say that the battle lines are going to be drawn very 
quickly among some of the liberals who are trying to cut the 
defense budget said rep john rowland rconn 
no liberal himself rowland is concerned about the fate of the 
trident which is built in his home state 
two defense department sources speaking only on condition of 
anonymity said the 1991 pentagon budget may propose building a 
trident every other year instead of the current annual construction 
schedule general dynamics electric boat division in groton 
conn which has built all the tridents and which has only one 
other competitor would bear the brunt of such a slowdown 
i would expect that if in fact the administration does 
recommend an alternateyear program which is not a cataclysm but 
a step back from full support there will be a major argument on 
the floor said sen joseph lieberman dconn 
sen dale bumpers dark for the past year has been pushing 
for a construction slowdown based on commitments the reagan 
administration made in strategic arms talks with the soviet union 
tentative start agreements reached in geneva in 1987 would limit 
the number of ballistic missile warheads to 4900 under the 
current trident program the number of warheads aboard the subs 
alone would approach that figure within a few years 
im just trying to save a little money said bumpers my 
objection is we are continuing to produce tridents on the old 
schedule and in light of the tentative agreement in the start 
talks that just doesnt make sense 
when the senate returns jan 23 bumpers said he will be ready 
with his proposal again regardless of whether the bush 
administration endorses the slowdown idea 
the arkansas democrat said the warming of relations between the 
united states and the soviet union would add momentum to his 
proposal 
on the house side rep thomas foglietta dpa is leading a 
similar campaign in a letter last spring to president bush signed 
by among others rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house 
armed services committee foglietta warned of the consequences of 
overbuilding 
we may end up buying tridents in excess of those we would 
deploy under start foglietta wrote this may force premature 
retirements of one or more tridents forfeiting a 
multibilliondollar expenditure 
also on fogliettas agenda is saving the v22 osprey a vertical 
takeoff airplane from the budget knife part of the osprey 
project would be handled by a boeing plant near fogliettas 
philadelphia district 
an armed services committee aide who asked to remain anonymous 
predicted that proposals to slow down trident production will be 
looked at with great favor in the house 
electric boat began building tridents 16 years ago nearly two 
football fields long and 42 feet in diameter the tridents carry 24 
ballistic missiles each with eight warheads they have a cruising 
speed of 20 knots 
although trident has been one of the most popular defense 
programs on capitol hill there have been pockets of opposition in 
1986 the administration budget contained no startup money for a 
future trident and it took senate action to restore the funds after 
the house failed to act 
in 1988 the house seapower subcommittee led by rep charles 
bennett dfla cut out funding for trident but the full armed 
services committee restored the money bennett wanted to build more 
destroyers instead of the trident 
general dynamics has plenty of submarine work to keep it busy 
into the 1990s even if trident is switched to an everyotheryear 
schedule but a slowdown would begin a cycle of layoffs and 
rehiring which would destabilize the workforce and increase the 
cost of a trident by some 200 million according to electric boat 
spokesman neil ruenzel

nobody has much experience in moving a country 
from communism to a system with a big role for private business so 
east european governments have turned for guidance to a pair of 
worldwide bodies based in washington 
they are the world bank and the international monetary fund 
both owned by 152 countries which have many different mixes of 
public and private ownership the united states takes a leading 
role in both organizations 
their headquarters face one another in washington three blocks 
from the white house the bank is headed by president barber b 
conable a former republican congressman from new york state and a 
friend of president bush at the fund the top official is 
traditionally a european now managing director michel camdessus of 
france 
a senior imf official said last week that the fund is now in 
contact with all the major east european countries 
the soviet union has said it wants to join but the united 
states has opposed that on the ground that the country is far from 
a market economy poland and hungary are already members the new 
czechoslovak government says it would like to be 
camdessus himself put the final touches to an accord with poland 
that has brought decontrol of prices a convertible currency and 
other measures that the fund traditionally advises 
we believe that the program the polish authorities have 
adopted is a very strong one said the official who spoke on 
condition he not be identified they are trying to tackle in a 
very determined fashiom the key problem in the country which is 
skyrocketing inflation 
the fund and bank influence governments mostly through loans and 
the conditions attached to them they promote conservative 
policies sale of stateowned industry reduced government 
deficits abolition of price controls holddowns of wages 
promotion of exports cuts in subsidies 
poland has promised such policies and in return is expected to 
get a loan of 710 million from the fund billions in other loans 
are expected to follow on top of the 42 billion poland already 
owes 
the fund has been making similar arrangements for years with 
third world countries the borrowing governments promises 
generally result in a time of austerity higher prices for food and 
other basic goods as government subsidies are cut higher 
unemployment as unprofitable enterprises are shut down the fund 
says the austerity will be worse if the measures are delayed 
sometimes the belttightening programs have resulted in bloody 
rioting as occurred last year in venezuela and jordan 
in poland bus fares and gasoline prices were doubled at the 
start of the new year food prices are also rising higher food 
prices previously have brought unrest when they were imposed by the 
warsaw government 
because of the imfs stiff requirements other lenders usually 
wait for the fund to act before making new loans themselves the 
agreement between the fund and the borrowing country has teeth if 
the fund decides that the brrower has not kept its promises 
disbursements are cut off 
that occurred last year with yugoslavia which has had 11 
successive agreements with the fund eight of them completed to the 
funds satisfaction now yugoslavia has another crisis and a new 
accord is being negotiated 
china has had billions of dollars of help from both the fund and 
bank to meet its general obligations and for specific projects 
such as building schools and roads 
were setting up a unit to deal with socialist economies and 
to see how much crossfertilization there can be with europe and 
asia said shahid yusuf a pakistani who has been handling the 
world banks relations with china 
he added in an interview that there will be important 
differences from country to country in eastern europe 
in china 90 percent of farm households now work independently 
though they are still obliged to sell some of their production to 
the state but yusuf predicted that in the soviet union it will be 
much harder to break up the big collectives and state farms in 
poland on the other hand the communist government never 
interfered much with private farmers but it gave them much less 
help then they thought they needed

for the past halfyear as the district of 
columbias murder rate grew ever higher actor charlton heston has 
noted ironically in a national rifle association television ad 
they banned guns in this city a decade ago 
and the criminals just laugh at their laws he intones 
sirens wailing in the background that tells me guns arent the 
problem criminals are 
the district of columbia has one of the nations toughest gun 
laws yet armed violence persists of the record 438 murders in the 
nations capital in 1989 about 78 percent were committed with 
firearms says metropolitan police officer quintin peterson 
in addition he said more than 1300 people were shot and 
wounded police estimate that about 60 percent of the killings were 
drugrelated 
the district of columbias firearms control act of 1975 
implemented in february 1977 banned the sale of handguns with a 
few exceptions for law enforcement and security personnel and 
required registration of all firearms previously purchased those 
seeking to register the weapons also had to submit to a thorough 
background check 
so where are these guns coming from 
the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms which 
compiles an annual report on guns retrieved in crimes in 
washington found 52 percent of those collected in 1989 came from 
virginia a slight increase over 1988 and 18 percent came from 
maryland up from 15 percent from the previous year said dick 
pedersen of the atf office covering washington maryland and 
virginia 
if you put them together you have 70 percent of the guns 
he said you can basically disregard the rest of the country 
were looking at ones and twos from rest of the union people 
moving in and losing their gun having it stolen 
the study is based on traces of several hundred guns each year 
which are randomly selected he said a total of 2333 firearms 
were picked up in washington last year he said 
while some of the weapons are rifles this is really a handgun 
city and a handgun area pedersen said were finding more than 
half the guns picked up in crime now are semiautomatic handguns 
and that appears to be growing based on the last couple of years 
in many cases these are not the nowinfamous saturday night 
specials cheap handguns bought on the spur of the moment 
we find a lot of highquality firearms a direct result of the 
drug trade pedersen said they can afford high quality and 
they buy them 
some are the same weapons used by police forces around the 
country 9mm semiautomatic handguns that cost 500 to 700 apiece 
he said at the same time many of the guns are small and 
concealable 25caliber semiautomatic pistols that cost about 200 
he said 
the nra contends that washingtons murder rate the highest in 
the nation demonstrates that gun control doesnt work 
gun control laws vary widely in the major cities with some of 
the highest murder rates in 1988 the top 12 among the 35 us 
cities with 400000 or more people included four cities with no gun 
control measures including detroit which has the second highest 
murder rate 
seven more of the 12 had relatively strong gun control laws 
while one miami had a threeday cooling off period for a gun 
purchase but no background check on the buyer 
at the same time honolulu covered by a strong state gun 
control measure showed the lowest murder rate among the 35 largest 
cities 
law enforcement officials and gun control advocates say theres 
more to the issue than whether an individual city has strong 
controls 
they say washingtons location carved out of maryland and 
virginia with virtually no natural boundaries other than the easily 
crossed potomac river makes its handgun ban virtually 
unenforceable 
in washington you can drive across the river and purchase 
handguns said susan whitmore of handgun control inc until 
this last year virginia had one of the weakest gun laws in the 
country 
new york city has the same problem she said 
more than 90 percent of the guns used in new york crimes 
come from other states with very weak laws whitmore said 
thats why we believe we need a national law 
a new law in virginia that took effect nov 1 1989 requires an 
immediate background check prior to the purchase of assaultstyle 
weapons and most handguns a person wishing to buy a gun must 
complete an application and the gun dealer must call the virginia 
state police to get approval for the sale 
as of dec 31 1989 virginia officials had approved 9834 sales 
each of which could involve numerous guns and rejected 109 
applications said state police lt r lewis vass who runs the 
program 
the program has produced an unexpected dividend the capture of 
three fugitives one from florida and two from new jersey by state 
law police have until the close of business the day after a 
gunpurchase application has been rejected to tell the gun dealer 
the rejection is confirmed or a search of records found the sale 
could be made as a result some people rejected initially have 
returned to gun stores the next day to get the final decision in 
three cases police were waiting when the fugitives returned vass 
said 
officials also are hoping prosecution of certain gun dealers 
will curb illicit sales donald p percival a former us park 
police officer who owned gun stores in virginia and james s 
chapman a former dc police officer and retired secret service 
uniformed agent were convicted in november of illegally selling 
semiautomatic handguns to an 18yearold drug dealer who resold or 
traded the weapons for drugs in washington 
while whitmore said she was encouraged by virginias new law 
pedersen said its still too early to tell what impact it will have 
on gunfire in washington saying the problem occurs when legitimate 
purchasers in virginia provide weapons to people who would be 
ineligible to purchase them legally 
gun control groups want national laws but one law enforcement 
official says regional controls might be sufficient 
if you were in a town that had mountains or deserts around it 
and people had to travel four hours and take two interstates to get 
to the area i can see how you might control a problem like this 
the officer said but in washington its like walking across the 
street to get a hamburger were one large urban area here its 
hard to keep guns out of dc when there are no natural borders

in the heart of this fashionable 
washington suburb theres a yuppie dream house thats gone to the 
dogs 
the luxurious amenities of the doghouse that richard t ziegler 
built for crissy his white german shepherd and jr his doberman 
pinscher would strain the hyperbolic lyricism of a real estate ad 
writer 
their doggie digs feature a redwood cathedral ceiling italian 
porcelain tile flooring solid brass fixtures a terra cotta 
chimney for the fake flagstone fireplace cedarshake roof and 
doublepaned windows with space heater to keep it toasty warm on 
winter nights 
outside theres a kidneyshaped pool surrounded by a patio deck 
and rock garden 
and all for only 15000 plus 
ziegler had the doghouse designed as a miniature 8foot version 
of the 35 million contemporary victorian mansion that ziegler 
built for himself on 25 acres of rolling woodland in the virginia 
countryside west of washington 
he says he plans to build an equally lavish guest cottage 
below the doggie pool to house crissy and jrs overnight visitors 
its a doggone shame but the two dogs hardly ever use their 
posh living quarters except to flop down on the cool tile floor 
for relief on hot summer days ziegler says unlike the doghouse 
that jim and tammy bakker built this one isnt airconditioned 
so far crissy and jr have only dipped their paws in the pool 
ziegler says although they enjoy sprawling on the deck to spy on 
squirrels and other wildlife scampering in the woods 
they spend most of the time in my house he said they 
sleep on their own bed right in the master bedroom you dont tell 
a doberman where hes going to sleep 
ziegler 53 a developer whose companies have built two dozen 
shopping centers in metropolitan washington north carolina and the 
san francisco bay area isnt the sort of man whod nail a few 
pieces of plywood together to make a doghouse like most folks 
ziegler believes in going first class 
his own backyard has a gigantic heated swimming pool with three 
waterfalls gurgling past rock gardens and a bubbling whirlpool 
bath the main house with its vaulted ceilings and wide glass 
windows is covered with 4 miles of redwood siding and 320 tons of 
flagstone from the blue ridge mountains 
his fivecar garage is full its currently occupied by a white 
lincoln stretch limo with telephones bar tv set and curving white 
leather sofa a white jaguar convertible a couple of neoclassic 
excalibur and zimmer touring cars and a fourwheel drive vehicle 
that belongs to my dogs ziegler also keeps a 53foot italian 
motor yacht berthed in miami 
not bad for a bread truck drivers son from suitland md who 
couldnt afford to attend college but took night classes raised a 
family and worked 90hour weeks for two decades to build a booming 
construction business 
does ziegler have any qualms about spending more than 15000 
for a doghouse while homeless people are sleeping in the streets of 
washington 
not at all he says thats why i worked all my life so i 
could do things like that

in the six months he has been 
president carlos menem has boldly addressed argentinas biggest 
problems so far with little success 
to overcome inflation and recession that forced his predecessor 
to leave office 22 weeks early menem put up for sale state 
companies his peronist party nationalized or created four decades 
ago 
to reduce tensions in the armed forces he called off the trials 
of officers accused of kidnapping torture and murder during the 
197683 dictatorship pardoning several hundred soldiers along with 
a handful of onetime leftwing terrorists 
to restore ties with great britain severed during the 1982 
falkland islands war menem set aside the thorny issue of 
sovereignty over the south atlantic archipelago consulates 
reopened in buenos aires and london last month full diplomatic 
relations are pending 
he said nothing about any of this during his campaign which 
focused on charisma and nationalism historian felix luna said in 
an interview the change has been night to day 
nevertheless menems willingness to tackle headon issues his 
predecessor raul alfonsin ignored or tried to finesse has not 
moved argentina from the brink of hyperinflation social unrest and 
military insurrection 
the cost of living in december soared by at least 50 percent 
eight times the november rate inflation for 1989 topped 4200 
percent real wages have shrunk to about onehalf the level of a 
year ago underemployment and unemployment total 16 percent 
teachers police officers bus drivers unskilled laborers and 
many others earn about 100 a month or less all have held strikes 
since menem took office 
wages are absolutely insufficient and if prices dont come 
down people arent going to have enough even to buy food 
said cesar jaroslavsky leader of the opposition radical civic 
union bloc in the house of deputies 
noting that hundreds of border guards were deployed last month 
in rosario argentinas secondbiggest city and the site of food 
riots in may and june jaroslavsky added i think social unrest 
is a real risk 
the army remains bitterly divided between loyal officers and 
rebels who staged three insurrections against alfonsin president 
from december 1983 through last july 
there is no possibility of a military coup said rosendo 
fraga executive director of the union for the new majority studies 
center for that you would need three things at least some 
international support at least some public support and an 
efficient military leader in argentina none of those three 
factors exists 
only menems harshest critics blame his policy errors for 
argentinas continued economic and political morass others note 
ills run so deep that a major endeavor in one area fails to resolve 
it at one fell swoop and provokes problems somewhere else 
the governments confiscation of several billion dollars worth 
of certificates of deposit last week stabilized the austral and 
lowered interest rates from 600 percent a month but it also dried 
up funds for investment and may worsen the existing recession 
it also eroded public confidence in the government and the 
banking system 
the government is disoriented and menem doesnt know what to 
say said juan sanabria a dentist as he waited in line outside 
a bank everytime he opens his mouth he makes things worse 
if menem a career politician who was jailed nearly five years 
during the last dictatorship has ignored tradition and struck out 
in new directions he also has shown himself to be unpredictable 
volatile and willful 
if a plan fails or a minister lets him down menem changes to 
another three of the eight cabinet ministers he appointed in july 
have been replaced on dec 10 a new official exchange rate was 
set on dec 18 controls on foreign exchange were lifted 
menem allowed longtime aide eduardo curia to draft a plan to 
dollarize prices and wages in an effort to stabilize the 
austral at the last minute menem changed his mind curia resigned 
from the economy ministry days later 
menem has correct intuitions but he has demonstrated he has 
little liking for the routine of government said fraga of the 
centerright studies center 
among the sharpest criticism of menem is that having pushed 
through legislation giving him authority to sell state companies 
and cut the budget he has done neither 
also some accuse him of spending too much time kissing snow 
queens at ski resorts driving in car and boat rallies playing 
soccer and tennis and playing host to foreign dignitaries 
menem tells argentines his government is on the right track and 
has accomplished more in six months than previous governments did 
in six years 
as much as he has wavered in other areas menem stands firmly 
behind plans to sell the state airline railroad and other public 
companies to deregulate the oil and other state industries to 
remove government controls of wages prices exchange and interest 
rates and to cut state spending and encourage foreign investment 
from my point of view this is the last serious crisis he 
said in an interview published last week by the news magazine 
gente the important thing for me is not to lose calm to be a 
good pilot in a storm

a strike by engineers of the national 
railway renfe reduced service between major cities sunday as 
spaniards returned home after the epiphany holiday management and 
union officials said 
the 24hour strike the third since christmas forced renfe to 
cancel international service to all cities except lisbon and geneva 
renfe officials said 53 domestic intercity trains ran far fewer 
than normal while commuter train service was reduced by 30 percent 
management said about 15 percent of the engineers struck but 
union representatives put the figure at 60 percent 
management and unions that represent the majority of renfes 
50000 employees oppose the strike because the engineers are 
seeking to negotiate a pay increase separate from the existing 
collective bargaining agreement

a coalition created by six east german reform 
movements to challenge the communists crumbled sunday just three 
days after being formed underscoring the difficulties 
prodemocracy forces face in may elections 
while communist party leader gregor gysi kicked off his partys 
campaign in potsdam one of the prodemocracy groups announced it 
was leaving the coalition and the largest group said it preferred 
to run candidates independently 
the communist party has been stripped of its constitutional 
mandate to rule and has been tarnished by corruption scandals but 
the lack of a credible alternative has left it in control of the 
government and better positioned for the election than the 
fractured opposition 
massive street demonstrations and the exodus of thousands forced 
the communists to grant historic concessions last year including 
the promise of free elections may 6 
dozens of citizens groups pressing for social political 
environmental and economic reforms have sprung up since the oct 18 
removal of communist leader erich honecker and the nations turn 
toward democracy 
social democratic leader steffen reiche said thursday his party 
had joined with new forum democratic awakening democracy now the 
initiative for peace and human rights and the united left to form 
election alliance 90 
but the united left announced sunday it had withdrawn from the 
coalition telling east germanys official adn news agency that the 
group had been misleadingly presented in the announcement 
thursday 
bernd gehrkes of united left said his group was open to other 
alliances if suitable common policies can be worked out 
new forum the largest of the proreform groups with more than 
200000 members throughout east germany held a strategy congress 
in leipzig over the weekend and announced its union with the other 
groups was limited 
the 150 new forum delegates said the election of individual 
independent candidates was preferable to voting for political 
parties or alliances and that new forum candidates would rather 
run alone 
regulations on campaigning and balloting are to be set out under 
a new election law a draft of which is expected to be published 
before parliament meets thursday 
differences among opposition groups also have become apparent 
during the weekly negotiations among the various reform movements 
the communists and other political parties 
the confrontation between the fractured opposition groups and 
the communists could result in collapse of the talks and further 
destabilization of premier hans modrows transitional government 
the talks began dec 7 to provide a forum for drafting reforms 
and airing the views of citizens groups that have no 
representation in the government 
democratic awakening has threatened to pull out of them monday 
unless modrows government shows proof the former state security 
force has been disbanded 
new forum said it too would leave the talks if parliament acts 
to form a secret police force before the elections 
adn reported in december that the government had abolished the 
oncefeared secret police agency but media reports have since 
contended some armed units continue to operate 
modrow said in an interview sunday with austrian television that 
a security force is needed to prevent the spread of rightwing 
extremism in east germany 
communists have made the recent rise in neonazi incidents a 
major theme of the election campaign and an argument against 
reunification with west germany 
a greater germany would awaken concerns in the rest of 
europe modrow told austrian television 
opposition forces consider modrows cabinet to have limited 
authority because it was chosen by a communistcontrolled 
parliament that was not democratically elected 
new forum also insisted during the meeting in leipzig that 
delegates should be assigned to government ministries and 
commissions to give the opposition a voice in national affairs 
prior to the elections

hundreds of people clamoring to buy imported vcrs 
surrounded stores in a russian city for five days and some even 
staged a hunger strike and protests demanding the chance to buy the 
precious goods a newspaper said sunday 
it was the latest show of discontent among soviets who are 
deprived of many consumer goods 
the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya described the incident in the 
russian city of yaroslavl as a video uprising 
the disturbance began when word went out that imported vcrs for 
workers who had earned foreign currency had been delivered to a 
store in yaroslavl an industrial city about 125 miles northeast of 
moscow 
about 200 people immediately surrounded the store and sat 
through the night demanding they be given the chance to buy the 
vcrs as well two other stores that also received shipments were 
similarly besieged the newspaper said 
at dawn of the fourth day the angry residents launched a 
protest on the central town square eventually city authorities 
persuaded the workers who were to receive the vcrs to share some of 
their spoils with the public the newspaper said 
but when the store at the center of the turmoil did not 
immediately begin selling some of its 158 vcrs to all customers the 
next day a group of citizens declared a hunger strike 
finally after five days of turmoil a happy buyer walked out of 
the store with the first vcr called the local tv station and 
declared victory the panasonic is in my hands 
sovietskaya rossiya said this was the first time in yaroslavl 
history that videocassette recorders were sold freely to the public 
traditionally imported electronic goods have been quietly 
distributed only to the party and government elite or sold on the 
black market where a vcr can cost as much as 6400 
these days under the kremlins economic reforms factories that 
earn foreign currency are generally allowed to decide for 
themselves how to spend it and they frequently buy western 
consumer goods for their workers 
residents of the central russian city of sverdlovsk took their 
frustration to the streets in similar unrest dec 29 when a crowd 
upset by the shortage of vodka gathered downtown and halted city 
transport 
communist party officials soothed them and flooded the stores 
with vodka and the crowd dispersed when people rushed off to buy 
their bottles the newspaper rabochaya tribune or workers 
tribune reported 
the sovietskaya rossiya story did not specify which days the 
video uprising took place but indicated the disturbance had 
ended recently

tourists have chiseled so many souvenirs out 
of the berlin wall that some sections are in danger of collapsing 
and police have had to cordon off one especially hardhit area near 
the brandenburg gate 
the east german government plans eventually to tear down the 
entire wall and replace it with normal border markings president 
manfred gerlach disclosed in an interview last week but freelance 
demolition work has already proceeded on the 100mile border 
barrier especially on the west berlin side 
east german border guards on sunday welded steel bars over a 
gaping hole near the brandenburg gate to shore up the reinforced 
concrete structure 
west berlin police put up crowd control barriers saturday around 
the most damaged sections to keep adults and children from climbing 
inside giant holes carved out of a doublewalled segment police 
cited a danger of collapse 
once covered by graffiti the wall has been chipped bare at the 
brandenburg gate the 18thcentury arch that now symbolizes german 
unity 
the wall has also taken a beating at checkpoint charlie the 
famed intraberlin crossing but police said they do not fear a 
collapse there 
on sunday onlookers and chippers on the west berlin side booed 
when east german border guards welded steel bars over a 7foothigh 
hole at the reichstag the former seat of germanys parliament near 
the brandenburg gate 
enterprising vendors have been selling pieces of the wall for up 
30 and even rent hammers and chisels for doityourself chipping 
but each wall chunk removed means lost business for east germany 
an east german company said last month it plans to raise western 
currency by selling sections of the wall removed from the 
brandenburg gate and potsdamer platz a square that was the hub of 
1920s berlin 
profits from sales are to go to humanitarian causes 
communist east german authorities have punched dozens of 
crossings into the wall since their decision nov 9 to open borders 
to the west the action was the result of a sudden and peaceful 
popular revolution that drummed hardline communist leaders out of 
power

eastern european governments have fallen in 
love with free markets but theres at least one free market that 
doesnt love them 
the more democratic governments that have taken over from the 
hardline communists in eastern europe are still liable for the 
debts incurred primarily during the 1970s when western bankers 
thought the soviet bloc was a good credit risk 
but there is waning hope among western financial dealers that 
the loans will ever be paid in full even as western governments 
are seeking ways to support the democracy movement so that western 
bankers and businesses will invest in eastern europe 
western bankers fear the new eastern european governments will 
set their sights more on internal development programs and less on 
paying off old debts 
the old debts of poland and some other eastern european 
countries are bought on the socalled secondary market by 
speculators who want to collect the interest still paid on them by 
the borrowers 
speculators also hope that they can sell the debt at a higher 
price or that some day the debtor government will pay in full 
last july polish debt was selling for as much as 41 cents on the 
dollar of the debts original value but friday polish debt was 
selling at just 175 cents on the dollar and the debts of hungary 
and bulgaria have started to show signs of weakness 
the debt of yugoslavia a communistruled country outside the 
soviet bloc has been sharply devalued 
keith fogarty managing director of dillon read international 
finance estimated that poland owes 6 billion to 7 billion to 
private creditors in other countries for the past few years these 
debts have been trading on the secondary market at 35 cents to 45 
cents on the dollar 
then last fall the poles sent out a telex saying they could 
not pay the full interest anymore only about 15 percent of it 
fogarty said in an interview the poles said they pay the remainder 
of the interest later but financial markets are dubious 
fogarty said poland has many other pressing needs for the hard 
foreign currency yen dollars or west german marks in which the 
interest must be paid but it has few ways to earn that money 
it needs foreign currency for example to buy equipment for 
farms that have been much neglected partly as a result of that 
neglect it has little food to sell the united states and western 
europe are sending relief shipments 
other experts point out that the new polish government the 
first noncommunist authority in eastern europe in 40 years is led 
by people who were active in the solidarity trade union they would 
not want to be seen paying out large sums to financiers at a time 
when workers are being thrown out of jobs and paying high prices 
for necessities 
for their parts the new governments in poland and other 
countries are eagerly freeing the prices of goods from traditional 
communist controls and letting them find their own level on the 
market 
the new governments hope the inevitable price rises will bring 
more supplies that would ease the equally traditional communist 
scarcity of food and other basic products 
the price of a loaf of bread in poland which has taken the lead 
in opening up to the market has just gone up from the equivalent 
of 9 cents to 14 cents 
most of the polish and other east european debt being traded was 
money lent by private banks in west germany france and japan with 
a small share from american bankers many of those bankers believed 
the soviet union ultimately would be responsible for polish debt 
but in the early 1980s moscow made it plain that it would not 
the central intelligence agency estimated that the soviet union 
owed 423 billion in the west at the end of 1988 about as much as 
poland but soviet debts are not much traded 
unlike poland yugoslavia and many third world countries the 
soviet union has always kept up with its payments it has vast 
resources of gold and petroleum that produce hard currency 
yugoslav debt was selling friday at 525 cents on the dollar 
according to dillon read 
paul masco a trader at salomon brothers said that yugoslav 
debt had sold for as little as 40 cents on the dollar it rose to 
57 cents last fall after the yugoslav government started a program 
of buying some of it back in yugoslav currency at prices 
advantageous to creditors now yugoslavia is in trouble and the 
price has fallen again 
masco said hungarian debt had been trading at par but recently 
it fell to 98 cents or 99 cents on the dollar because of the 
expectation that hungary will want to borrow a lot more money 
there is some doubt about the countrys ability to handle a lot of 
new debt he added 
according to the world bank hungary already owed private 
creditors more than 13 billion at the end of 1988

christian troops and moslem militiamen 
battled with mortars and tank fire across beiruts dividing green 
line for a second day sunday while hundreds of plo guerrillas were 
deployed to stop militia battles in south lebanon 
no casualties were reported from the fighting in beirut or the 
duels between the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god and 
the prosyrian amal militia in south lebanon 
the violence in beirut after a threemonth lull raised fears of 
renewed carnage in the 14yearold civil war 
thousands of beirut residents scurried to basements and bomb 
shelters as the thunderous blasts of mortar and artillery shells 
echoed across the city 
moslem militias entrenched in the ras elnabaa neighborhood 
accused soldiers of christian gen michel aoun of starting the 
clash aouns command said in a communique that syrias 
surrogates were behind the escalation 
green line fighting on saturday killed two christian civilians 
and wounded two moslems the clashes also forced the closing of the 
only gateway between the moslem and christian sectors of the 
capital police said it was the gravest violation of a ceasefire 
called by the arab league on sept 22 
that truce halted six months of murderous artillery duels 
between aouns forces and the syrian army which aoun has vowed to 
drive from lebanon 
the accelerating tempo of the violations is alarming said a 
police spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing rules 
there is no cohesive mechanism to curb the breaches 
the hostilities reflect a deepening political crisis resulting 
from aouns defiance of the government of president elias hrawi 
elected by parliament nov 24 
hrawi was elected as part of an arab league peace plan that aoun 
refused to accept he opposed the plan because it did not include a 
deadline for the withdrawal of syrias 40000 troops from lebanon 
also at war are amal and hezbollah shiite moslem militias who 
have been battling two years for domination of lebanons 12 
million shiites 
irans deputy foreign minister mohammad ali besharati arrived 
in the syrian capital saturday seeking a settlement to the latest 
round of fighting which has killed at least 77 people and wounded 
275 wounded since dec 23 
the plo sent in 400 guerrillas sunday to reinforce a 300strong 
force dispatched last week to separate amal and hezbollah fighters 
police said 
the plo guerrillas fanned out in a twomile buffer zone between 
hezbollahs front lines in the village of kfar milki and amals 
forces in the adjacent village of kfar hatta police reported 
the guerrillas equipped with jeepmounted antiaircraft guns 
and shoulderfired armor piercing rockets ignored warning shots 
from hezbollah fighters and set up checkpoints 20 yards from the 
entrance to each village 
both sides had been pounding each other with rockets and other 
artillery but stopped after the guerrillas moved in 
police said the plo apparently is seeking to prevent either 
shiite faction from capturing territory that would give it direct 
access to the palestinian refugee camps of ein elhilweh and mieh 
mieh 
the camps are plo chairman yasser arafats main strongholds in 
lebanon

liberians are fleeing across the border 
to the ivory coast to escape violence resulting from an alleged 
coup attempt and they accuse the military of killing civilians 
indiscriminately it was reported sunday 
on saturday president samuel k doe warned liberians to be on 
the safe side and turn in suspected rebels 
the british broadcasting corp said sunday that liberian 
refugees who crossed into neighboring ivory coast claim soldiers 
have opened fire on civilians and killed an unknown number 
it is difficult to determine the number of liberians fleeing 
because the border area is heavily forested and communications are 
poor some reports have put the figure as high as 8000 to 10000 
the sparsely populated region 100 miles northeast of monrovia 
the capital was placed under a dusktodawn curfew 
fighting erupted two weeks ago when liberia claims about 100 
rebels led by a former liberian civil servant crossed into 
northeastern nimba county from ivory coast to overthrow doe 
doe told thousands at a rally in monrovia on saturday that 
liberian forces were engaged in a massive search to find remaining 
rebels 
he ordered citizens to inform on the rebels whereabouts 
because if we catch them in your home we will treat you as a 
rebel therefore furnish us with information if you want to be on 
the safe side 
liberia said the rebels who call themselves the national 
patriotic front killed more than 200 people but that troops were 
bringing the situation under control and only a few of the 
dissidents remained at large 
brig gen edward smith army commander in the embattled nimba 
county was quoted on the radio as saying that in one border town 
rebels shot to death seven people as they were praying in a mosque 
smith also said three identity cards taken from suspected rebels 
identified the rebels as being from ivory coast 
liberia repeatedly has accused ivory coast of harboring does 
opponents a charge the ivorians deny ivory coast president felix 
houphouetboigny reportedly sent a highlevel delegation to 
danande the ivorian border village from where the dissidents are 
said to have crossed into liberia 
in paris the humanitarian organization doctors without borders 
said an evaluation team that flew to the ivory coast on friday 
found a precarious nutritional situation among the liberian 
refugees most of whom were women children or elderly people 
the number of wounded people arriving in the ivory coast is 
not very great for the moment the organization said in a 
statement 
a second threemember team carrying emergency medical gear was 
being dispatched sunday night from paris to abidjan the ivory 
coast capital the group said 
the dissidents are led by charles taylor a liberian government 
official from 198083 taylor was accused of embezzling nearly 1 
million and fled to the united states where he was imprisoned 
pending extradition he escaped in 1984 
his forces appear to have no connection with liberias 
opposition parties 
doe a former sergeant major seized power in an april 1980 coup 
in which president william tolbert and most of his political allies 
were killed

a graduate student charged with crippling 
a national computer network goes to court this week and win or 
lose his showcase federal trial will mean more stringent computer 
security laws say industry experts 
robert t morris jr 24 of arnold md a graduate student 
suspended from cornell university is the first person to be tried 
criminally under the 1986 federal computer fraud and abuse act 
jury selection begins monday 
morris is accused of designing and setting loose in november 
1988 a rogue program that replicated wildly immobilizing an 
estimated 6000 computers linked to a research network including 
computers at the national aeronautics and space administration 
facility at moffet field calif and at the air force logistics 
command at wright patterson air force base in dayton ohio 
the program was originally described as a computer virus 
but experts said it was more properly called a worm which 
unlike a virus does not need to be in a host program to duplicate 
itself 
morris a firstyear doctoral student in computer studies has 
never admitted creating the worm or introducing it into the 
internet system but a cornell commission concluded morris created 
the program and was guilty of reckless disregard in doing so 
morris whose father is chief scientist at the governments 
national computer security center in bethesda md faces up to 
five years in prison and a 250000 fine if convicted 
its a nolose situation because the trial will showcase the 
weaknesses of computer security and current computer security 
law said harold highland professor emeritus of computer science 
at the state university of new york and editor of computers amp 
security a trade journal 
if the government loses he said computer security advocates 
will say there is a need for stronger laws if the government 
wins theyll say he did it because the system is weak and we need 
to tighten up the system 
christopher a breceda of american computer security industries 
inc a nashville tenn maker of security systems agreed 
either way it goes the pure attention is going to fuel the 
cry for tougher laws and better security he said whether 
morris is convicted or not we win 
the 3yearold federal law makes it a felony to intentionally 
access a federal interest computer without authorization and alter 
destroy or damage information or prevent access to such 
computers 
the law applies only to us government computers computers of 
financial institutions and networks covering more than one state 
joseph b tompkins jr chairman of the american bar 
associations task force on computer crime is one of numerous 
computer crime specialists who have appeared before congress to 
urge passage of an even stronger law 
in november tompkins told a house judiciary subcommittee the 
statute is unclear about whether a hacker can claim he didnt have 
malicious intent and that it was an innocent prank or a 
demonstration of weaknesses in computer security 
morris attorney thomas guidoboni raised the question of 
intent in a motion seeking dismissal of the indictment us 
district judge howard munson rejected the request 
it is expected that guidoboni will focus on intent as morris 
defense several associates have said that morris created the worm 
to call attention to the security shortcomings of the internet 
system but that the program ran amok 
eugene spafford a professor of computer science at purdue 
university who has written articles on the morris case and a book 
on computer viruses said that the lack of intent to damage should 
not be a defense 
ten years ago these kinds of things didnt hurt anybody but 
you have to realize now all the places where computers are used and 
the dangers involved in shutting down a system or damaging data 
said spafford who is expected to be a government witness 
theres only a subtle difference between this and a person who 
burns down a building and says he didnt mean to do it and says 
it just got away from me 
spafford said computer crime losses in the united states total 
about 7 billion annually 
the worm allegedly created by morris did not destroy any data 
and prosecutors have not put a price tag on the damage but 
spafford estimated the oneday paralysis cost between 5 million 
and 15 million in lost time and in later protective work 
spafford also said he believes the case will focus attention on 
computer security but he doesnt think it is going to affect a 
public perception that such crimes arent serious 
there is a kind of sympathy for the hacker hes seen as a 
bored college student or a brillant college student exposing a 
weakness or striking a blow against the system said spafford 
nevertheless all the inconvenience and damage that is caused 
fits what id call vandalism

gov michael s dukakis will be the issue in this 
years race for governor even though the unpopular democrat wont 
even be on the ballot 
dukakis popularity took a nosedive after he returned from his 
unsuccessful bid for president in 1988 to a state in its worst 
financial crisis since the mid1970s its bonds are ranked lowest 
in the nation by one rating agency 
even former attorney general francis bellotti a democrat who 
backed dukakis for the presidency and has been a fixture in state 
politics is running as a selfstyled outsider 
with the party primaries still more than eight months away the 
democratic race also includes lt gov evelyn murphy and rep john 
flood of canton a dukakis critic boston university president john 
silber and boston mayor raymond flynn are considering the 
democratic race us rep joseph kennedy has taken himself out of 
it 
the republican field is led by former federal prosecutor william 
weld and state house minority leader steven pierce it also 
includes former rep paul cronin and former metropolitan district 
commissioner guy carbone 
the fields will probably be narrowed during state political 
conventions in march for republicans and june for the democrats 
both parties require candidates to get the support of at least 15 
percent of the convention delegates to win a spot in the sept 18 
primaries 
dukakis took himself out of the governors race a year ago 
setting the stage for a wideopen election that republicans say 
could be their best chance of recapturing an office they have not 
held since 1974 
that was the year dukakis defeated republican incumbent frank 
sargent except for a fouryear absence after he was defeated by 
democrat edward j king in a primary in 1978 dukakis has been 
governor since 
pierce says the states fiscal mess with the budget deficit 
still calculated at about 500 million even after a series of sharp 
cuts in state spending and the failure of dukakis and the 
democraticcontrolled legislature to solve it will be a focus in 
the gop nomination for governor 
that asbolutely presents us with our best political 
opportunity in many years said pierce who brought up the issue 
of rising state spending and sinking revenues while dukakis was 
running against george bush 
weld announced his bid for the republican nomination last week 
in 1990 the people of the commonwealth are saying that they 
are ready for a change ready to move beyond the big government 
philosophy that has brought us to the brink of fiscal ruin weld 
said 
pierce is a veteran legislator while weld lost his one bid for 
statewide office an attorney generals race against bellotti in 
1978 he then made a reputation for fighting public corruption as 
us attorney for massachusetts 
republicans are not alone in calling for change 
bellotti who served as attorney general for 12 years before 
stepping down in 1986 called on voters to take back the state 
from technocrats and team players in his announcement 
i have spent my career threatening the status quo and running 
as an outsider bellotti said who has run for governor twice 
before 
flood house chairman of the legislatures taxation committee 
also sounded an outsider theme when he announced his candidacy in 
october 
there are those who say a democrat cannot win next years 
election for governor of the commonwealth that will not be the 
case if our party embraces new ideas new directions and most 
important new leadership for the 90s flood said 
even murphy the team player bellotti referred to has 
advocated tougher fiscal management than dukakis 
murphy however has been the only candidate to join dukakis in 
calling for higher taxes to balance the states budget and has 
campaigned for support among traditional democratic interest groups 
such as public employee unions 
before becoming lieutenant governor murphy served in dukakis 
administrations as secretary of environmental affairs and as 
economic development secretary 
silber a transplanted texan considered conservative by 
massachusetts democratic standards could become the ultimate 
outsider candidate although he is looking for support from some 
traditional democratic powers they include state senate president 
william bulger and former boston mayor kevin white now a bu 
faculty member 
flynn may be inching closer to seeking the democratic 
nomination saying recently that he is willing to lay it on the 
line if the legislature fails to raise taxes to save social 
programs and aid to local government flynn while potentially 
appealing to liberals on most social issues opposes abortion a 
position that could give him trouble in a state that polls show is 
solidly prochoice

iranian parliament member ali akbar 
mohtashemi said in an interview released sunday that iran does not 
want ties with the united states and that the lebanese have a right 
to hold foreign hostages 
in the interview with the englishlanguage tehran times the 
former iranian foreign minister said iran is interested in 
developing diplomatic relations with all the countries of the world 
except the united states israel and south africa 
mohtashemi said the holding of foreign hostages in lebanon was 
an internal matter and he believes the lebanese are within their 
rights 
lebanese sunnis shiites druse and christians are the 
hostages of the us israel and other western powers mohtashemi 
said so its their natural right to take hostages to inflict 
heavy blows on their enemies 
no negotiations but force is the answer to what the enemies 
of the lebanese have done against that deprived nation he said 
the 18 foreigners held hostage in lebanon are believed held by 
shiite moslem groups loyal to iran the hostages include eight 
americans among them terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press 
anderson was kidnapped march 16 1985 and is the longestheld 
hostage 
an advance copy of mothashemis interview was telexed to the 
associated press in nicosia by the newspaper 
president hashemi rafsanjani ousted mohtashemi as interior 
minister after his election last july mohtashemi a leader of a 
radical group of clergy was elected to parliament in a byelection 
last month 
before becoming interior minister in 1984 he was ambassador to 
syria and was credited with creating hezbollah or party of god 
the fundamentalist lebanese shiite militia believed to be the 
umbrella for the groups holding hostages 
the mothers of two swiss relief workers who were taken hostage 
in lebanon four months ago arrived in beirut on sunday with a 
petition signed by 70000 people urging the mens release 
emmanuel christen and elio erriquez worked as orthopedic 
technicians at a red cross clinic in south lebanon that provided 
artificial limbs to lebanese and palestinian war victims 
no group has claimed responsibility for kidnapping christen 32 
and erriquez 23 the plo and lebanese police contend the pair are 
held by the fatah revolutionary council a breakaway guerrilla 
group led by palestinian terrorist mastermind abu nidal the group 
has denied responsibility 
i cannot be pessimistic in thinking of my sons release i 
should always be optimistic marianne christen told reporters 
upon arrival at beirut airport she and graziella erriquez planned 
to hold a news conference in beirut on monday and return to geneva 
on tuesday 
on saudi arabia mohtashemi said that close ties were blocked by 
what he called the kingdoms suppression of iranianled 
demonstrations during the 1987 pilgrimage to mecca more than 400 
demonstrators mostly iranians died in ensuing violence and last 
year saudi arabia executed 16 kuwaiti shiites it said confessed to 
planting bombs that killed one pilgrim 
the two events bar any moslem country from having relations 
with such a foreigndependent country mohtashemi said 
he said relations with syria would remain strong and not be 
changed by the recent restoration of links between syria and egypt 
syria was irans staunchest ally during the iraniraq war and 
egypt backed iraq

soldiers killed an armed infiltrator from 
jordan near an israeli tourist resort sunday in the fifth shooting 
this year along the countries border an army spokesman said 
defense minister yitzhak rabin issued a tough statement on 
behalf of the government saying israel regards jordan as fully 
responsible for any border infiltrations 
the army spokesman said troops opened fire on a gunman wearing a 
jordanian army uniform near the hamat gader sulpher springs park 
five miles east of the sea of galilee

was absent since yesterday and had his personal weapon 
the official quoted by the staterun petra news agency said 
soldiers had searched the area but could not find him 
israels chief of staff lt gen dan shomron told army radio 
that the infiltration may have been carried out by palestinian 
guerrillas that crossed from a third country into jordan to attack 
israelis along the border 
but he also said that the recent spate of attacks could have 
been carried out by jordanian soldiers encouraged by the recent 
success of islamic fundamentalists in jordans parliamentary 
elections 
on friday israeli troops patrolling in the same area came under 
fire twice afterward the army evacuated dozens of tourists who 
had been bathing in the springs or fishing 
israel radio reported that radical palestinians led by abu musa

the attack

appeared to be attempting to infiltrate from jordan about six miles 
south of the sea of galilee and one of the wouldbe infiltrators

for the prevention of hostile acts against the territory of 
israel 
rabin said the army is increasing its activities to prevent 
shooting and the infiltration of terrorist squads from the 
territory of jordan into israel 
the statement was released after a cabinet discussion on the 
shooting incidents 
in jordan foreign minister marwan elkassem said israel is 
responsible for the shooting incidents and that jordan has no 
desire to increase tensions along the border israels army radio

the leftist sandinista government has 
approved six entry visas for american diplomats to allow the 
minimum number of officers at the us embassy an official source 
said sunday 
twenty us diplomats were expelled from nicaragua on dec 29 in 
retaliation for a raid by us troops on the nicaraguan 
ambassadors residence in panama city nine us diplomats were 
left in place including charge daffaires john leonard 
under international conventions the minimum number of diplomats 
in a foreign mission is 15 
the nicaraguan foreign ministry source who insisted on 
anonymity said the six american diplomats were expected to arrive 
soon 
leonard has been the chief us diplomat in managua since july

panamas gen manuel noriega decided to give himself 
up after an aide warned he risked the same end as italys fascist 
dictator benito mussolini the papal nuncio in panama was quoted

monsignor jose sabastian laboa the vaticans representative in 
panama said capt eliecer gaitan noriegas personal security 
chief helped persuade noriega to leave the vatican embassy

public square 
laboa has insisted that noriega left the embassy on his own 
accord and previously denied reports he gave noriega an ultimatum 
to leave the mission 
laboa said there was never any talk of granting concessions and 
that once it was made clear noriega would not be sent to another 
country it came down to getting him to accept guarantees such as 
not facing the death penalty in the united states 
he knows panamanian prisons while i told him those in america 
have tv and air conditioning the nuncio was quoted as saying in 
turins la stampa and other newspapers 
laboa said it was his decision to allow noriega in the embassy 
dec 24 and that he did not have time to consult with the vatican 
i asked help from the lord and understood that the most 
important thing was to avoid further combat and that if noriega 
entered the embassy the battle was over the nuncio was quoted 
as saying 
noriega took refuge in the embassy four days after us troops 
invaded panama in an effort to capture him and bring him to the 
united states to face drug charges noriega left the embassy jan 3 
and was taken to miami to face charges

an iranian legislator shouted to 
protesters across the soviet border sunday that iran wants closer 
relations with them but that border protests are useless irans 
official news agency reported 
about 1000 demonstraters on the soviet side of the araks river 
which forms part of the closed border chanted islamic slogans for 
two hours sunday the islamic republic news agency said 
the report from the border town of jolfa said a similar group 
gathered on the iranian bank of the river and responded to the 
enthusiasm of the soviet moslems 
soviet protesters in the republic of azerbaijan are demanding 
freedom to travel to the iranian region of the same name like 
iranians most residents of soviet azerbaijan are shiite moslems 
soviet officials expressed concern about islamic fundamentalism 
creeping across the border after the islamic revolution in iran in 
1979 
the border protests began dec 31 and at one point extra soviet 
border guards were deployed to control demonstrators who threatened 
to dismantle the border barriers 
irna monitored in nicosia said karim shafei representative 
from the northwest city of marand in the national parliament used 
a loudspeaker to tell soviets the iranian people want closer 
relations 
but he called on them to safeguard the security of the border 
lines the report said 
it quoted him as saying the protests on the riverbank were 
fruitless and that soviet moslems can talk to their officials to 
prepare the grounds for visiting iran 
another irna report quoted demonstraters as threatening to build 
a bridge across the river with their own hands if their demands for 
freer travel were not met 
it said the demonstraters were demanding the government fulfill 
promises made six months ago for freer travel to iran especially 
to visit religious shrines 
tehran radio also monitored in nicosia reported that three 
soviet moslems crossed into irans azerbaijan over the weekend and 
returned home after a daylong visit carrying souvenirs and copies 
of the koran islams holy book 
the broadcast said the soviet azerbaijanis crossed the araks 
river and visited iranian moslems in the village of poldasht on 
saturday 
it did not say if the men swam the river or used boats 
four soviet youths cut through wire border fences on the river 
and swam to the iranian side a week ago a fifth companion drowned 
tass the official soviet news agency said protesters have 
destroyed guard observation towers electronic alarm equipment and 
communications lines along the border since the unrest began 
it said one person was killed in a clash among protesters but 
did not give details 
the iranian broadcast coincided with a report on moscow radio 
that the azerbaijani government has promised to allow more access 
to arable land on the banks of the araks river and take measures to 
make it easier to cross the border into iran 
soviet azerbaijan was acquired by russia in the 1800s in 1941 
the red army moved into northern iran and the soviets set up a 
puppet state there but after an international outcry the troops 
pulled out in 1946

a soldier who claims he went into hiding from 
stalins secret police 42 years ago has emerged from the woods 
convinced by reports of the kremlins reforms that it is finally 
safe soviet media reported sunday 
ivan bushilo was a 25yearold decorated veteran newly returned 
home when he ran afoul of josef stalins secret police in 1947 
soviet tv reported in footage showing the wrinkled but 
healthylooking 68yearold adjusting to life in his home village 
in byelorussia 
when his attempts to fight the injustices of the security police 
put him in serious danger bushilo fled to the byelorussian woods 
and lived off the land in primitive shelters for the next four 
decades soviet tv said 
he had almost no human contact except for rare visits from close 
relatives the official news agency tass reported 
none of the reports explained how bushilo could have survived 
the cold winters and they did not say if soviet officials believed 
bushilos tale 
in an interview with the weekly news program seven days bushilo 
said it was reports about president mikhail s gorbachev in 
newspapers he was brought that persuaded him to come back 
asked why he didnt return earlier bushilo said i didnt 
come out because i didnt trust anybody only now i trust 
gorbachev and only gorbachev 
bushilo said he was never sick throughout all those years in the 
woods he survived without a gun mainly by trapping and fishing 
and gathering what the forest would yield 
relatives brought him occasional clothes food and newspapers 
tass said 
bushilo told soviet tv it was knowing he was right that gave him 
the strength to survive 
my truth gave me all the strength i needed the former 
peasant said i am not a criminal i was not hiding from justice 
for some crime but for the truth

the overthrow of panamanian gen manuel antonio 
noriega not only rid the united states of a nettlesome regime in 
this hemisphere but dealt a blow to the nemesis at its back door 
cubas castro government observers say 
there are many impacts for castro said jamie suchlicki 
director of the institute of interamerican studies at university of 
miami noriega was an ally of fidel so he lost a friend more 
importantly he lost a place where he could do business 
some everhopeful cuban exiles saw the us invasion and 
noreigas surrender as a step toward bringing down castros 
31yearold government 
the people in cuba have to be free maybe in six months no 
later than one year said norberto pino part of the crowd that 
turned out at the federal courthouse thursday for noriegas 
arraignment on drug charges 
rent this ad when fidel falls read a banner pulled by a 
small plane flying over the courthouse 
sen bob graham dfla noted that the ouster of noriega 
followed the falls of oneparty governments in the east bloc 
castros cooled relations with reformminded moscow and the rise 
of elected governments in latin america 
with the downfall of yet another dictator castro will seem 
even more like a relic out of step with the times and out of 
touch with reality graham said 
panamas new leader president guillermo endara has said his 
government will study the question of panamas relations with cuba 
but has other priorities now but few cubawatchers expect castro 
to have keep the advantages he had when noriega ruled panama 
while suchlicki said castro is firmly in control of his own 
country he and others identified a variety of likely effects on 
castro of the ouster of noriega including 
loss of a conduit for technology and a range of usproduced 
equipment and commodities banned from cuba because of the us 
trade embargo 
the us customs service indicting three men in 1987 for 
violating the us trade embargo with cuba on selling computer 
equipment said the cuban minister of commerce had set up several 
front companies in panama to get around the embargo 
castro has denied noriega cooperated with cuba in smuggling 
technology but even common items were getting from the united 
states to cuba via panama authorities say 
potential embarrassment for castro during noriegas trial 
the miami federal indictment alleges that castro acted as a 
mediator in a 1984 dispute between noriega and the medellin cartel 
cocaine traffickers he was supposed to be protecting in panama 
there are no details cited in the indictment and prosecutors 
said in 1988 they lacked evidence to indict castro along with 
noriega however some of the governments key witnesses have 
claimed firsthand knowledge of castros involvement 
castro denies that he supports drug trafficking us 
investigators have charged for years including in a 1982 federal 
indictment in miami of four cuban officials who were never 
prosecuted that castro has allowed cuba to be used for trafficking 
to the united states 
reduced intelligencegathering 
castros embassy in panama was a major intelligencegathering 
center said ambler moss former us ambassador to panama 
the loss of another friendly government in this region 
since 1979 when procastro governments came to power in 
nicaragua and grenada cuba has seen jamaicas michael manley 
government defeated in 1980 elections manley at the time blamed 
the united states but won elections last year after promising a 
moderate government that will seek cooperation with washington 
grenadas marxist government fall in a 1983 rift capped by the us 
invasion suriname sever most ties with cuba in 1983 and general 
decreased influence for leftist parties throughout the caribbean 
castro condemned the us invasion of panama and moss now dean 
of the graduate school of international studies at university of 
miami said castro is using the invasion as a distracting issue 
at home 
cubas economy is stagnant and reduced trade with east bloc 
countries and potentially reduced aid from the soviet union will 
worsen the economy and could stimulate domestic opposition the 
observers said 
fidel seems to be still strong and charismatic fidel is also 
ruthless suchlicki said 
i dont think the thing is ripe yet he said but after 
what weve seen in eastern europe i hate to be categoric about 
anything

the foreign minister believes the us 
government should be playing a greater role in helping romania 
recover from its prodemocracy revolution a human rights activist 
said sunday 
geri laber executive director of the usbased helsinki watch 
human rights organization also said human rights groups must 
ensure that loyalists of former ruler nicolae ceausescu receive 
fair trials and that laws are drafted to replace the draconian ones 
the communist dictator relied on for 24 years 
foreign minister sergiu celac told visiting helsinki watch 
representatives he was very disappointed that the united states 
government was so slow in responding to the situation in romania 
laber said 
celac indicated that the nation needs a counterbalance to an 
expanded soviet presence following a visit saturday by soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze according to laber 
under ceausescu the soviet bloc maverick who frequently acted 
independently of moscow the soviets had fairly little say in 
romanian affairs 
shevardnadze said his country supported the solidarity of the 
soviet and romanian peoples and pledged wideranging 
assistance including immediate supplies of sorely needed oil and 
gas 
several senior western government officials also have visited 
bucharest since ceausescus overthrow dec 22 
french premier roland dumas and west german foreign minister 
hans dietrich genscher are scheduled to arrive this month but 
despite considerable food and medical assistance from the united 
states rep frank wolf rva has been the highestranking us 
official to visit so far 
laber said as soon as i get back to the us i intend to 
pressure the state department into moving quickly on indicating 
unequivocally its concern for developments in romania 
on another matter laber said helsinki watch was very critical 
of the way ceausescu and his wife elena were executed although we 
deplore their crimes we feel they should have been given a fair 
hearing with the right to bring witnesses and present evidence 
in their defense 
the two were executed dec 25 by firing squad immediately after 
being tried in secret by a military court 
because this happened it is even more incumbent on the 
government to ensure that the arrested secret police officers are 
accorded fair trials and the helsinki group plans to send 
observers to monitor them laber said

glory the civil war movie starring 
matthew broderick and morgan freeman has passed muster as 
authentic in its depiction of a regiment of black soldiers 
two civil war experts who are sticklers for details found only 
minuscule breaches in the film 
russ pritchard a firearms expert at philadelphias civil war 
library and museum said he and flag collector stan smullen found 
extraordinarily minor flaws during a preview friday 
history buffs often have complained about the lack of 
authenticity in the treatment of the civil war on television and in 
the movies 
its an absolute incredible movie pritchard said 
the combat sequences are the best ive seen in a movie about 
the 19th century he said all the uniforms the accouterments 
the tack on the horses even what i would call the background 
props theyre all great 
pritchard said he and smullen each noticed a flaw 
in one scene recruits were issued enfield rifled muskets while 
someone called out the serial number of each weapon the regiment 
carried enfields pritchard said but enfields had no serial 
numbers 
smullen pointed out that the regiments american flags seemed to 
have had the stars sewn on during the civil war however stars 
would have been painted on the flags he said 
glory is the saga of the 54th massachusetts regiment the 
most famous black unit of the civil war it is the story of the 
soldiers struggle and the regiments triumph amid the lost battle 
of fort wagner in 1862

its against the law in new york to produce 
sell or even mail child pornography the states highest court 
weighs this week whether its also illegal to possess it 
the court of appeals will consider the legality of the 
indictment of william keyes of albany on five counts of promoting a 
sexual performance by a child the charge centers on keyes 
possession of pornographic magazines and videotapes with such as 
lolita colour special 7 and wonderboy and whether such 
possession constitutes promoting a sexual performance 
the items were found in his home during a police raid in august 
1986 he had gotten them from undercover police agents 
at the time of his arrest keyes was on five years probation 
after pleading guilty to promoting a sexual performance by a child 
because of the prior conviction keyes could face a maximum of 3 
to 7 years in prison if convicted on each of the new counts 
keyes 41 has argued that he was wrongly charged with 
promoting pornography because he contends he did nothing more 
than receive the items from an undercover policeman 
the prosecutor george barber countered that the decadeold 
state law under which keyes was charged defines promoting as 
among other things procuring pornographic items prosecutors 
argue that the law indicates that in this case keyes did 
procure the pornography which means he is subject to indictment 
according to court briefs albany detectives found keyes home 
telephone number on the stall of a movieviewing booth at a troy 
adult bookstore next to the number was written young boys 
wanted authorities said that phone number and statements keyes 
made to undercover policemen about the best places in albany to 
find underage models will justify the promoting a sexual 
preformance charge even if the high court throws out their 
argument that even possession is illegal 
so far state courts have been of two minds about the legality 
of the indictments 
state supreme court joseph harris ruled in albany in june 1987 
that the legislature intend to punish the creators and distributors 
of child pornographic materials not the customers and he threw 
out the indictments in new york a supreme court is a trial court 
in november 1987 the midlevel appellate division of state 
supreme court ruled unanimously that the indictments were proper 
the attorneys who will argue the case before the court of 
appeals the states highest court agree that the question is 
bigger than keyes own legal fate 
in his brief before the court barber urged the judges to state 
in their decision that neither the state nor federal constitutions 
protect the possession of child pornographic materials 
keyes attorney terence kindlon said albany county prosecutors 
are violating his clients constitutional rights by trying to 
equate promotion with possession 
a study of new yorks penal law kindlon said shows that the 
word procure means to go out and get something for someone 
else 
kindlon called keyes a good guy who acknowledged his problem 
with child pornography and was undergoing psychiatric therapy when 
approached by albany policemen about receiving pornographic 
materials 
the items were crammed into his hands and he was arrested for 
having them kindlon said 
you go to an alcoholics anonymous meeting on the hottest day 
in august and stand outside passing out free beers somebodys 
going to drink one he said 
our statute does not make simple possession of this stuff 
unlawful but theyre trying to read into it such a prohibition 
kindlon said theyre saying the word procure means that you 
cant have it unless you get it that the fact you have it proves 
you got it 
an attorney for the manhattanbased institute for youth advocacy 
filed a friendofthecourt brief urging the court to uphold keyes 
indictment the institute is affiliated with covenant house which 
estimates that half the homeless or runaway youths it takes in have 
been sexually exploited 
barber said 13 states including ohio illinois missouri and 
florida have expressly outlawed the possession of child 
pornography in the past eight years the us supreme court 
recently heard oral arguments in a case challenging ohios 
possession law 
keyes an auto body worker is described in court papers as 
about 80 percent disabled as the result of vietnam war wounds 
when he was put on probation after his 1984 conviction albany 
county court judge john clyne told him there is more to this 
life than the sickening perverted books you have been enjoying on 
your own read a good novel

a slightly built former nurses aide goes 
on trial monday for firstdegree murder in the death of one of 
seven elderly patients hes alternately confessed to and denied 
killing 
lawyers will begin monday with jury selection for jeffery 
feltners trial if convicted feltner could go to the electric 
chair 
feltner 27 stands 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighs barely 100 
pounds when he made anonymous phone calls to officials saying the 
seven patients did not die of natural causes but were strangled 
some people didnt believe his tale 
although investigators were initially skeptical authorities now 
say they believe feltner asphyxiated the seven patients over an 
18month period to ease their suffering 
the trial will look only at the death of sara abrams 75 at new 
life acres nursing home in melrose on feb 10 1988 feltner also 
faces a murder charge in volusia county for the july 11 1989 
death of doris moriarty 83 at clyatt memorial center in daytona 
beach 
prosecutors say they are continuing their investigation of the 
remaining five deaths four at new life acres from feb 7 to april 
6 1988 and one at bowmans nursing center in ormond beach on july 
27 1989 
a plea bargain fell apart late last friday afternoon when 
circuit judge el eastmoore refused to accept a deal that would 
have had feltner plead guilty to seconddegree murder in exchange 
for no more than 40 years in prison 
he was willing to bite the bullet said defense lawyer 
howard pearl who said feltner insists he didnt kill anyone 
feltners mother shirley hartman said her son grew up a loner 
she and his father split up three months before he was born she 
said 
she moved to melrose in putnam county in 1979 where feltner 
graduated from interlachen high school in 1986 hartman helped 
feltner get a job at new life acres where she worked as a nursing 
assistant 
in june 1988 feltner anonymously called a gainesville 
television station and a mental health crisis center and told them 
he had killed five patients 
but when questioned by detectives feltner denied it 
he eventually pleaded guilty to making harassing phone calls 
trespassing and making a false statement he served a 127day 
sentence and was freed nov 19 1988 
feltner followed a similar pattern last summer he told a 
daytona beach tv station a mental health unit and his roommate 
about the most recent death 
this time when daytona beach detectives questioned him feltner 
told them about all seven killings explaining that he did it to 
relieve the victims suffering but now he denies the killings 
both of the daytona victims had been cremated as were two of 
the four melrose patients 
officials received permission from abrams daughter to exhume 
her remains and prosecutors said an autopsy gave them the evidence 
they needed to back up feltners confessions abrams had broken 
ribs that showed she could have died when someone held her down 
while suffocating her prosecutors said

they would go to like rifle ranges and shoot they had 
knives too i know they had machetes said bonnie olivarez ho 
was 11 when she lived with the group in the spring of 1988 
it was kind of like normal at first and then it got really 
weird said bonnie who was with her mother in the cult and now 
lives with her father in the kansas city area 
they were all religious and everything but they didnt love 
me she told the kansas city star in an interview published 
sunday 
the girls mother deborah sue olivarez is among 13 members of 
the cult charged with murder or conspiracy in the shootings of a 
fivemember family whose bodies were found in a barn on the 
kirtland ohio farm where the group once lived 
the groups leader jeffrey lundgren his wife and their 
19yearold son were arrested sunday at a motel near san diego 
eight other people including bonnies mother were arrested last 
week 
two of lundgrens followers remained at large sunday

in kirtland are believed to be dennis avery his wife cheryl and 
their three young daughters authorities believe they died in 
april shortly before the group left ohio 
bonnie recalled that the group drank a lot and prepared for an 
assault on the kirtland historic temple site on may 3 1988 the 
temple belongs to the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter 
day saints which lundgren and his followers quit to form their own 
group 
in the days leading up to the planned assault men in the cult 
donned camouflage clothing and took target practice bonnie said 
on the morning of the planned attack lundgren went into the woods 
and came back saying god had told him to call off the operation 
she said 
much of bonnies story was confirmed by kirtland police chief 
dennis yarborough who told the newspaper that he got an anonymous 
tip the group planned to seize the temple which is based in 
independence and shares some beliefs with the mormon church based 
in salt lake city 
lundgren kept a sizable and legal arsenal yarborough said the 
weapons included bows and arrows 22caliber rifles and handguns 
he said bonnie said the cult had about 20 rifles and handguns 
at night and on weekends in 1988 the group donned military 
fatigues and army boots and watched violent films held firing 
practice in the barn and practiced how to recognize types of 
weapons and load and unload them in the dark investigators said 
bonnie said children in the cult were subject to sessions 
with lundgren if they misbehaved though she never had such a 
session 
in a session he would yell at the top of his lungs she 
said he would hit you and not with just his hands and stuff he 
would use poles too

the government on sunday tripled water 
and sewer rates and raised prices more than 25 percent on milk 
meat and bread as part of efforts to move hungarys economy toward 
capitalism 
it is the third eastern european country in a week to announce 
broad economic changes to curtail more than 40 years of price 
controls and subsidies implemented by communist leadership 
most of the price increases were to take effect monday with 
some coming into effect feb 1 the state news agency mti reported 
the government announcement carried by mti said meat prices 
will rise by 32 percent bread by 26 percent and milk and dairy 
products at least 42 percent 
the cost of cigarettes beer and spirits is to rise by 2022 
percent while rents will rise by 35 percent as subsidies are 
withdrawn mti said 
water and sewage rates will increase 336 percent because of a 
cut in state subsidies and previously irrationally low prices 
mti said to offset the increases the government will raise state 
pensions and family allowances the news agency said 
hungarians would have to pay at least 45 percent more for urban 
public transport and 55 percent more in the budapest area the news 
agency said 
the price increases will result partly from the state removing 
controls on prices as part of an austerity budget adopted by 
parliament last month 
on jan 1 poland and yugoslavia announced broad changes 
intended to transform those economies to capitalism cut inflation 
and make their currencies convertible for international trade

a roman catholic priest who was fired for 
denying holy communion to worshipers dressed in miniskirts and 
shorts got support sunday from a parishioner who said the priest 
was only trying to set a standard 
the rev roger griese 73 was placed on retirement from sacred 
heart roman catholic church last week by archbishop daniel 
pilarczyk who objected to grieses refusal of communion to those 
worshipers wearing clothing griese deemed inappropriate for church 
what did father griese do that deserves his dismissal debra 
olaughlin said in a letter she read in the basement after sundays 
mass 
he set a standard tried to tell people the proper dress and 
behavior in the proper place and got fired her letter said 
ms olaughlin had asked grieses successor if she could read 
the letter during the service but the rev francis pilliod told 
her she would have to read it in the basement afterward pilliods 
decision was met with shouts of disapproval from the congregation 
also sunday parishioner joseph cleary said he sent pilarczyk a 
letter signed by about 100 people in support of griese who plans 
to appeal his forced retirement to the vatican cleary said the 
signatures accounted for virtually all members of the parish 
it seemed to us that he pilarczyk didnt have any idea that 
the parish stood behind father 100 percent cleary said father 
isnt doing this all on his own its the rest of the parishioners 
who feel that way 
a letter from pilarczyk was read during saturdays mass 
explaining his decision to oust griese 
it is not intended as a penalty but reflects a judgment on my 
part that father griese is no longer able to fulfill the office of 
pastor wrote pilarczyk head of the cincinnati archdiocese 
this decision has not been pleasant or easy i ask that all of us 
pray for father griese 
griese who headed sacred heart for 21 years had twice denied 
communion to a man who came to church wearing shorts he also 
criticized the man before the congregation 
griese remains a priest in good standing and is entitled to 
retirement benefits

two 18yearold palestinians died sunday of 
gunshot wounds after clashes with soldiers and israeli authorities 
banned nine proplo activists from traveling abroad 
palestinian leaders charged sunday that the threemonth travel 
bans on the nine proplo activists imposed by interior minister 
aryeh deri were an attempt to disrupt usbacked efforts to 
arrange a palestinianisraeli meeting in cairo 
those targeted included sari nusseibeh and faisal husseini the 
two most prominent palestinians involved in behindthescenes 
diplomatic efforts 
husseini complained that israeli authorities were trying to 
nominate their own palestinian representatives for the proposed 
talks and block any role for the palestine liberation organization 
also ordered to stay in the country were nablus businessman 
saeed kanaan activist zuahira kamal and a delegation of five 
palestinian trade union leaders who were to attend a conference in 
egypt palestinian sources said 
nusseibeh was reportedly turned back at the allenby bridge while 
en route to jordan and others had planned trips to egypt which has 
been consulting palestinians about a list of 10 negotiators to meet 
with israel 
the englishlanguage jerusalem post and hebrew maariv dailies 
said the travel bans appeared aimed at disrupting contacts between 
local palestinian leaders and yasser arafats plo israel considers 
the plo a terrorist group and refuses to negotiate with it 
also sunday tel avivs mayor said he was prepared to meet with 
arafat and criticized prime minister yitzhak shamirs position 
toward the organization 
the interior ministry issued a statement saying deri banned the 
palestinians from leaving because he was convinced there was a 
serious suspicion that their exit abroad could harm state security 
because they could have met with hostile elements 
an israeli official who briefed a reporter sunday said he did 
not know if the travel ban was related to the diplomatic efforts 
but added the threemonth restriction was likely to expire before 
any israelipalestinian meeting was arranged in cairo 
the official said israel is not fully satisfied with 
washingtons response to israels demands for us guarantees that 
the plo will be excluded from the negotiating 
israeli sources confirmed media reports that us secretary of 
state james a baker iii sent a letter to israel refusing to give a 
rigid guarantee and backing arab demands that issues other than 
israels peace initiative could be raised at the cairo meeting 
the sources said unless israel could get stronger american 
guarantees a washington meeting that was planned to help set up 
the cairo talks might not be convened baker had planned to invite 
israels and egypts foreign ministers to the washington session 
later this month 
in tel aviv mayor shlomo lahat said israel will have negotiate 
with the plo and said he is ready to talk to arafat if it is 
permitted by law said city spokesman benny cohen 
lahat of shamirs likud bloc criticized shamir who has ruled 
out any contacts with the plo meetin with plo members without 
government authoritization carries a maximum threeyear prison

mask and fled from soldiers who ordered him to stop for questioning 
several hundred soldiers in bethlehems manger square watched

church bells pealed a mourning cadence and shopkeepers 
throughout bethlehem staged a spontaneous protest strike 
the second death came in the west bank village of attil

attil shortly after masked youths torched an israeli bus carrying 
arab workers to jobs in israel 
the radio said khalil was among a group of masked assailants

israelis during the twoyear uprising against israeli rule in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip at least 166 palestinians also 
have been slain by fellow arabs and 43 israelis have been killed

elaborate avantgarde staging cast of 60 and a message to bridge 
the distance between us with love has opened for four weeks at 
the city center 
junon and avos the hope is interesting though it will 
occasionally remind new yorkers of theater from south pacific 
to jesus christ superstar hair and les miserables it 
isnt really a copycat show 
the music is fatchorded guitar rock underlined with 
synthesizers loud but not superloud however it isnt all rock 
theres a choir at the back of the stage which sometimes sings 
church music four deepvoiced naval officers sing what could be a 
lovely sad russian lullaby some of the male solos lean toward yves 
montands style one of the forgingahead songs sung with serious 
intensity by the men has the catchy fun beat of honey bun 
from south pacific 
the story said to be true is easy to follow its written in 
the program and broadway veteran philip casnoff explains it from 
time to time the hope was first performed in moscows lenin 
komsomol theater in 1982 pierre cardin took that production to his 
paris theater in 1983 and is the producer of these timely 
performances 
the stage is a series of plastic panels lighted from 
underneath with some give when stepped on theyre steeply raked 
they dont meet in the center leaving a long narrow walkway for 
centerstage entrances and exits at the beginning a ship is 
poised center stage it is hoisted up still in sight 
count rezanov wants to take two ships junon and avos to san 
francisco and open trade and relations between the two countries 
he sails spain tells the governor that trade can only be with 
spain rezanov seduces the governors daughter conchita he returns 
to russia to get permission to marry her outside his church but 
dies she waits 35 years learns he is dead and becomes 
californias first nun 
finally the entire cast some changed into jeans gather to 
sing alleluia with lyrics imploring peace it starts like an 
oratorio then the rock group kicks in and with the younger 
players looking happier they join arms sway their bodies in 
circles and sing it like the tribe from hair 
nikolai karachentsev was a strong ruggedfaced count rezanov a 
romeo with a hand mike in america hed probably become a tv 
private eye or the next mick jagger in russia he acts in 
contemporary plays and classics and makes movies 
yelena shanina was a delicate conchita her small head and 
blonde hair making her look like a russian ballerina program notes 
say that alexander abdulov the narrator is popular in the 
komsomols musicals in tv and movies 
alexis ribinkov who wrote the music studied with aram 
khachaturian he composes classical music scores films and has 
written a second contemporary opera poet andrey voznesensky wrote 
the lyrics and book based on one of his poems director mark 
zakharov is artistic director of lenin komsomol theater lucy

water from trucks and scores of people filled jugs and bottles from 
downtown fountains as lima suffered through a severe water shortage 
lower than normal rainfall in the andes mountains has caused the

nasa officials decided sunday to 
continue the countdown toward a monday launch of space shuttle 
columbia although forecasters gave only 1in5 odds that the 
weather will permit it 
there is a chance and wed like to be ready to take that 
chance said william b lenoir the head of nasas space flight 
program as long there was more than a zero possibility for liftoff 
on monday he said the shuttles huge fuel tanks would be filled 
beginning late sunday 
there is a 20 percent chance we will get off lenoir told 
reporters weve all been here often enough to know that what is 
predicted does not always happen and sometimes good things happen 
when bad is predicted 
kennedy space center spokesman carl kristoferson said fueling of 
the shuttle began at 1053 pm est 
the space center has been socked in by fog for several days at 
810 am est the earliest the shuttle can be launched monday the 
launch opportunity lasts until 902 
the intricate timing on this 33rd shuttle flight is dictated by 
columbias main mission to retrieve a science laboratory the size 
of a small bus that has been in orbit around earth since its launch 
in april 1984 from the shuttle challenger 
columbia must be launched into the same path as the satellite 
which is called ldef for long duration exposure facility 
the aerial chase will have the shuttle trailing the ldef in the 
same plane or driving lane by flying in a lower orbit and thereby 
taking less time to go around the earth the shuttle eventually 
will catch up to the satellite snag it with its 50foot crane and 
bring it into the cargo bay mission specialist bonnie dunbar is 
set to be at the space shuttle controls during the retrieval 
if the shuttle takes off monday the retrieval would take place 
on thursday saturday or sunday depending on the exact minute of 
launch 
the ldef is a 12sided frame on which are mounted 57 trays of 
experiments including ones with tomato seeds and different metals 
and a a mechanism to catch interplanetary dust 
experimenters hope to gain valuable information about the 
universe and its origins from postflight examinations of cosmic 
dust interstellar gases and previously unobtainable subatomic 
radiation particles 
students from the fifth grade through college will try to see 
which of 12 million tomato seeds will grow engineers will learn 
how materials coatings electronic parts and thermal control 
systems are affected by long exposure to space 
commander dan brandenstein and his crew of four also will launch 
the fift of a series of navy communications satellites and conduct 
eight scientific experiments others on the mission are pilot jim 
wetherbee and mission specialists marsha ivins and david low 
the flight is to last 10 days matching the previous shuttle 
record to test equipment for longer shuttle missions flights of 
16 and 28 days also are planned as nasa prepares to the day when 
astronauts will be aboard a space station for up to six months

military men committed the nov 
16 massacre of six jesuit priests their housekeeper and her 
daughter president alfredo cristiani said sunday night 
it has been determined that there was involvement of some 
elements of the armed forces cristiani said in a fiveminute 
nationally broadcast address he termed the massacre abominable 
the president did not specify who was implicated in the crime 
nor did he indicate the rank or number of those responsible 
earlier col rene emilio ponce head of el salvadors joint 
chiefs of staff told the associated press that members of an elite 
battalion have been confined to their base and were being 
questioned in connection with the slayings 
however he emphasized that the 47 members of the elite atlacatl 
battalion including two officers are not under arrest 
it was unclear whether those soldiers and officers were the ones 
to whom cristiani referred 
priests and educators ignacio ellacuria ignacio martinbaro 
segundo montes amado lopez juan ramon moreno and joaquin lopez 
lopez were taken from their beds in their oncampus residence 
before dawn nov 16 and killed the priests housekeeper julia 
ramos and her 15yearold daughter celina were also slain 
ellacuria was the rector of the uca and martinbaro was its 
vice rector 
ponce said in a telephone interview that the men being 
interrogated were members of the unit that conducted a search of 
the jesuits residence at the orders central american university 
or uca two days before the priests were slain 
asked if the men were implicated by evidence other than the fact 
that they conducted the search ponce said he could not comment 
a uca employee has said she saw men in military uniforms outside 
the residence shortly before the shots that killed the priests were 
heard the woman lucia barrera has been taken for her own safety 
to the united states where she is under the protection of the 
jesuits 
cristiani said in his speech sunday that the work of a 
commission investigating the slayings has been from the start 
professional and exhaustive agents from the united states spain 
and scotland yard have aided in the probe 
the president also said a special commission of honor 
including highranking military men and respected civilian lawyers 
has been created to determine the exact circumstances of the 
slayings and clarify the truth in its complete magnitude 
he said the new commission would work with investigators to 
deduce responsibilities and make sure justice is done he said 
punishment would be meted out down to the last person 
implicated 
cristiani asked salvadorans to avoid speculation while the 
commissions carry out their work 
the priests were slain five days after leftist rebels of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln launched their 
biggest offensive of their 10yearold revolution the guerrillas 
have battled a succession of usbacked governments which they 
allege serve as civilian facades for repressive military rule 
the far right which is blamed for the deathsquad murders of 
several thousand suspected leftists in the early 1980s had 
consistently denounced the leftleaning uca jesuits as subversive 
ideologues 
in 1980 el salvadors roman catholic archbishop oscar romero 
was murdered and rightwing death squads were widely believed to 
be responsible the assassins were never brought to justice 
cristiani has vowed his administration would find and punish 
those responsible for the murder of the jesuit priests he offered 
a 250000 reward for information leading to the murderers arrest 
and conviction 
in the days following the slayings several highranking 
military officers including col francisco elena fuentes 1st army 
brigade commander publicly accused the rebels of the murders

the federal governments ban on 
nonprescription antibaldness drugs which goes into effect 
monday is expected to boost the already increasing sales of 
rogaine the only scientifically proven hairloss treatment 
the food and drug administration said in july there is no 
evidence to support the hairgrowth or antibaldness claims of 
hundreds of overthecounter creams lotions vitamins and food 
supplements american men spend as much as 300 a year on these 
socalled baldness remedies 
the agency said that beginning monday it will remove such 
products from the market on a casebycase basis if their 
distributors continue to make such claims 
the publicity from the ban as well as more effective advertising 
by upjohn co of kalamazoo have contributed to an increase in the 
sales of upjohns rogaine a prescription baldness drug that 
received fda approval in 1988 but has been slow to catch on 
analysts say 
rogaine sales in the fourth quarter of 1989 totaled about 21 
million compared with a disappointing 5 million in the fourth 
quarter of 1988 when it first was introduced in the united states 
said ronald nordmann an analyst who follows rogaine for 
painewebber inc in new york he attributed the increase to more 
forceful advertising 
total us sales of rogaine in 1989 were about 65 million 
nordmann said but he said the drug is still unprofitable because 
about 50 million was spent on advertising he estimated 1990 sales 
would jump to about 100 million and even higher if the fda 
approves upjohns similar product for female pattern baldness this 
year 
upjohn applauded the fdas ban on its wouldbe competitors but 
spokeswoman kaye bennett said friday it would be difficult to 
isolate the bans effect on rogaines improving sales 
sales have certainly been influenced by the introduction of 
the 1800 number in rogaine ads bennett said 
since it was introduced in ads in may the tollfree number has 
generated about 200000 calls from people wanting more information 
about the product bennett said upjohn also has offered financial 
incentives of 10 to consumers who see their dermotologists 
regarding hair loss regardless of whether rogaine is prescribed 
and 5 in coupons for each of the first four months of rogaine 
treatment 
the patented drug is a 2 percent solution of the drug minoxidil 
which originally was developed to treat high blood pressure but was 
found to have the unintended side effect of promoting hair growth 
the solution which is applied externally to the scalp costs 
about 60 for a onemonth supply once the treatments are stopped 
any new hair will probably fall out company officials say 
the drug has been shown in testing to grow hair in about 39 
percent of young men who are in the early stages of balding 
william gilbertson director of the fdas overthecounter drug 
review program said he expects many of the nonprescription 
products now on the market to simply change their labels to promise 
fuller thickerlooking hair rather than hair growth to conform 
with the new regulations many of these products are sold by mail 
in drug stores and through barbers and beauticians 
one wellknown product the helsinki formula is in compliance 
with the fda regulations because it does not promise hair growth 
but suggests that a cleansing agent it contains can relieve the 
impediment to hair growing naturally said hal z lederman 
president of pantron i of los angeles the products maker 
nordmann the industry analyst said he doubts upjohn will pick 
up a substantial amount of consumers who typically buy such 
products because of rogaines higher price and the longterm 
commitment involved in its use 
but even if a portion of a 300 millionayear market swings 
over to rogaine thats potential for a significant increase he 
said

videotex the delivery of information and services 
on a computer screen has struggled to gain a foothold in us 
homes but a texas company figures that what works on rue dorme in 
france will play on elm street usa 
us videotel inc based in houston and financed by a swiss 
backer is patterned after the french governmentowned minitel 
system minitel is an inhome computer linkup to services ranging 
from information like sports scores and theater schedules to 
shopping games and banking services 
videotel even uses terminals made by the same company that makes 
minitels computers and one service allows connection to the 
french system 
minitel is the result of a total revamping of the french 
communications system including a 1 billion investment over five 
years in france the terminals are provided free but users are 
charged to connect to the system 
past american videotex efforts have failed several companies 
have poured millions into development only to be met with 
resistance by computerphobic consumers 
videotel believes it has two hooks to land the domestic market 
local information including restaurant menus and movie schedules 
and its own computer terminal eliminating the need for the user to 
own a personal computer 
those two factors distinguish videotel from the main us 
consumeroriented videotex service prodigy a joint venture of 
sears roebuck and co and international business machines corp 
prodigy requires a pc plus a modem for customers to communicate 
with the service via a telephone line 
the same factors helped persuade jc penney co inc to sign on 
with videotel last week to make its catalog products available to 
subscribers beginning feb 1 said art steinberg penneys catalog 
business development manager 
also videotel has had enough success in houston that penneys 
can see how a market responds steinberg said penneys which also 
participates in prodigy may use videotel to advertise its store 
merchandise he said 
for 1495 a month videotel subscribers get a dumb computer 
terminal that provides access to a menu of services customers with 
pcs and modems can get the programming for 995 a month the same 
price as prodigy 
the us company takes the best parts of the french system 
and combines that with our strategies that have been molded to the 
american structure said craig spencer head of videotels dallas 
operation 
since debuting in april videotel has signed up 23000 
subscribers in houston and added 2350 in dallasfort worth since 
becoming available there the first of november 
videotel was founded three years ago and is bankrolled by an 
anonymous swiss investor spencer said the company started out in 
texas because it first reached a marketing agreement with 
southwestern bell telephone co for houston 
the company will expand next into canada where it also has 
agreements with the telephone company spencer said videotel has a 
goal of about 45 million homes within five years 
despite videotels early success skeptics remain 
efrem sigel president of communications trends inc in 
larchmont ny disputes the perception that videotex has been 
successful in france where he said the public has been force 
fed minitel because of its government ownership 
videotex is even less likely to succeed as a mass medium in the 
united states the analyst said 
nowhere have i seen it demonstrated that videotex is a 
costefficient way to deliver information into homes he said 
whereas business success may depend on immediate information 
consumers dont need information instantaneously he said 
what is it that the consumer is going to use this for that he 
cant get on television or in newspapers he asked 
sigel relegates videotel to a new generation of companies that 
will lose tens of millions of dollars on this stuff 
a survey by the videotex industry association said only 28 
percent of us households have pcs and only 6 percent have the 
necessary modems videotel figures that by providing its own 
terminal it can overcome those limitations 
the network is basically a mall spencer said users can 
shop from gateway square which includes several vendors or 
they can play games call up news stories look up information in 
an online encyclopedia check menus and prices at area restaurants 
and find out whats playing when at local movie houses some banks 
also allow customers access to their accounts through videotel 
negotiations are under way with vendors to allow customers to 
order tickets to events from or even to order a takeout meal at 
their favorite restaurant 
we want this to be a utility spencer said as indispensable 
as electricity running water and the telephone 
the system is analogous to cable television in that many of the 
services are included in the basic rate while others such as 
billpaying or tying into frances minitel cost extra 
but even spencer concedes that videotels success will depend on 
the quality of information and services it provides and that the 
future is far from assured 
the market is so virgin to this type of technology he said

a woman who hoarded thousands of coupons 
and raked through the trash to get proofs of purchase for refund 
deals faces trial monday on federal charges of mail fraud and 
conspiracy to distribute fake coupons 
connie arvidson a 34yearold wife mother and selfdescribed 
dumpster lady said she became obsessed over the years in her 
quest for special offers through rebates and coupons but she said 
she didnt know the coupons she bought through an advertisement in 
a coupon magazine were counterfeit 
at times she would pay garbage collectors to retrieve products 
that qualified for special offers at one point 1000 liquor 
bottles a week soaked in her bathtub to facilitate labelremoving 
and hundreds of thousands of coupons were jammed into files 
but its the coupons not the refund programs that have brought 
her to the eve of a trial 
assistant us attorney steve sucsy who will prosecute the case 
in dallas where the case originates would not comment the case 
friday with the trial so close but in the past he has said 
there is no way she didnt know what she was doing 
mrs arvidson and nine others were indicted in june 1989 in 
connection with a 2 million counterfeit coupon scam according to 
the indictment the coupons for food and other products were 
printed and distributed nationwide from texas 
mrs arvidson is accused of knowingly buying and distributing 
fake coupons 
its like a nightmare that i have to sit in a courtroom with 
some of these people i dont even know and see them try to hurt me 
for something i never did mrs arvidson said ive just got to 
think im going to come home and be with my little girl 
the trial of mrs arvidson along with two san antonio men named 
in the indictment is expected to last a week the charges against 
david rees and james floyd richards of conspiracy to commit mail 
fraud relate to the printing and distribution of the coupons sucsy 
said 
the seven others the man accused of advertising the coupons and 
six accused of purchasing them from him through the mail have made 
plea bargains sucsy said friday 
mrs arvidson said she and other refunders had joked that the 
coupons might be stolen but she believed the ad was legitimate 
since it was in magazines 
if im guilty of anything then maybe im guilty of accepting 
stolen goods she said 
and by stolen she says she thought the coupons might have been 
taken from dumpsters she plans to bring to court as evidence of 
dumpster treasures three large rolls each containing 10000 
bar code strips for light bulbs 
mrs arvidson said got the bar code strips which could be used 
as proofs of purchase by trading with a woman who plucked them 
from a dumpster behind the light bulb factory in return the woman 
got material qualifying the sender for rebates from a diaper 
manufacturer 
in refunding i quit being surprised mrs arvidson said 
i found anything could happen in refunding 
she said her little job brought her satisfaction and she 
became known in the world of refunding mrs arvidson estimates she 
made 200 a week at her rebating peak on top of that she paid 
little for groceries because of coupons 
i got known as the diaper exxon seagram cooler lady 
mrs arvidson said about the proofs of purchase that she 
accumulated and then rebated traded or sold to other refunders 
everybody loves you if you have something she said 
nobody wants to know you if you have nothing thats what its 
like in refunding 
mrs arvidson said she has little left her husband has gotten 
disability payments after a car wreck but is no longer employed and 
shes filed for bankruptcy 
mrs arvidson said that although others accused in the coupon 
scam have made plea bargains she wont 
they wanted to give me 18 months in jail i said thats 
ridiculous i didnt do anything 
she faces up to 30 years in prison plus 15 million in fines 
if convicted on all charges

saudi arabian oil co announced 
sunday the discovery of a gas and oil field the third find in six 
months by the worlds largest oil exporter 
the announcement from saudi aramco headquarters in dhahran said 
the strike in the raghib area about 77 miles southeast of the 
saudi capital of riyadh was commercially viable 
testing on jan 1 showed raghib1 well could produce 3650 
barrels per day while gas could be produced at the rate of 10 
million cubic feet per day it said 
the announcement distributed by the official saudi press 
agency said the oil was of the highquality sulphurfree crude 
found earlier in the year in the dilam and alhawtah discoveries 
saudi oil minister hisham nazer said friday that the new oil 
discoveries south of riyadh produced oil of the highest quality 
that could raise saudi arabias perbarrel oil income by 1 to 2 
the kingdom already boasts the worlds largest single oil 
reserves which it estimates at 252 billion barrels saudi aramco 
has recently intensified its search for new oil deposits in the 
center of the kingdom away from the massive producing fields along 
the gulf coast 
nazer said in a television interview aired late friday that the 
kingdom will seek a higher oil production quota this year and the 
following years from the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries 
nazer said the kingdom was confident that world demand for oil 
will rise in the 1990s resulting in satisfactory prices for both 
producers and consumers 
saudi arabia has been able through cooperation with its 
fellow members of opec and through contacts with oil producers to 
restore stability to the world oil markets nazer said we are 
beginning to feel that the situation is improving for the better 
nazers comments echoed those of king fahd who said dec 31 
that the kingdom will work to increase its current opec quota of 
538 million barrels per day no new target figure was disclosed
