a louisiana house committee thursday 
voted to ban abortions except in cases where pregnancy endangers a 
mothers life a bill supporters hope will provide a landmark court 
test 
sponsors hope the measure if approved by the full legislature 
to be the vehicle for a challenge to the us supreme courts 1973 
roe vs wade decision which legalized abortion 
house criminal justice committee members approved the bill 
without comment or objection the vote ended two days of hearings in 
which antiabortion and abortion rights advocates were each given 
four hours to state their cases 
antiabortion sentiment is strong in both the full house and the 
senate 
abortionists would face up to 10 years in prison at hard labor 
for violating the law if it were approved 
in hearings the committee tried to build a record of testimony 
and evidence that will lead to a reversal of roe vs wade 
the committee heeded the plea of rep woody jenkins dbaton 
rouge to avoid amending the bill to make exceptions in cases of 
rape or incest 
gov buddy roemer calling himself a prolifer said he would 
veto any bill that doesnt contain those exceptions 
similar bills now are on both the house and senate floors 
abortionrights forces predicted the hopedfor challenge to roe 
vs wade would fail if the law were passed 
the state will wind up spending 3 million and we will look 
ridiculous said robin rothrock president of the league of women 
voters 
jenkins floor leader for the antiabortion forces noted that 
legal experts had testified that a law without exceptions and with 
criminal penalties would likely bring a legal challenge that could 
reach the supreme court and test roe vs wade

the citys morning and afternoon 
newspapers agreed friday to dissolve their joint operating 
agreement ending the knoxville newssentinels lawsuit against the 
knoxville journal 
owners of the newssentinel and journal announced they had 
reached an agreement in principle to end their 4yearold pact by 
the end of december 1991 
after the agreement ends the journal intends to publish 
separately and in competition with the newssentinel the 
statement said 
under the joint operating agreement the newssentinel provides 
sales production and distribution for the journal editorial 
departments of the two newspapers are separate 
under the newspaper preservation act of 1970 the attorney 
general can approve a limited antitrust exemption if he finds one 
paper is in danger of failing and a joint operating agreement would 
ensure survival of independent editorial voices 
 
the lawsuit alleged the journals owner persis corp violated 
terms of the agreement when the hawaii company purchased the 
maryville daily times in neighboring blount county in december 
journal editor and publisher gerald garcia also was made president 
and publisher of the daily times 
the newssentinel which recently began a zoned edition in 
maryville considered the daily times a direct competitor 
the lawsuit contended that with garcia in the dual roles the 
daily times would have access to the newssentinels confidential 
business information and trade secrets 
as part of the termination arrangement the newssentinel will 
pay persis 40 million in two 20 million installments the money 
will be in lieu of payments the journal would have received from 
dec 31 1991 through the scheduled end of the agreement on dec 
31 2005 
the newssentinel is owned by the ew scripps co of cincinnati 
the morning paper has a daily circulation of 101000 and a sunday 
circulation of 169000 the journal is an afternoon paper that 
publishes monday through saturday with a circulation of 40000 
we are pleased with the agreement said thurston twiggsmith 
president and chief executive of persis which publishes six daily 
newspapers including the honolulu advertiser and three weeklies 
once we concluded that it was unlikely that the joa would be 
extended beyond 2005 we wanted to begin separate publication at a 
time when the journal was a strong and vital part of the knoxville 
community he said 
scripps president and chief executive lawrence a leser said he 
was also satisfied with the settlement 
this onetime payment is less than the expected amount the 
newssentinel would have paid in distributions to the journal had 
joint operations continued through 2005 said leser whose company 
owns 19 daily newspapers 
we look forward to hardy economic competition in addition to 
the fierce editorial competition that has existed between the two 
newspapers for many years 
until the termination in 1991 the newssentinel will continue to 
act as agent on certain business matters for the journal under a 
special interim agreement that provides for the journals 
reasonable prospects for ongoing economic viability

the university of michigan is searching 
for a term to replace freshman in describing the first year of a 
womans college experience 
mary jo frank editor of the faculty and staff newspaper 
university record asked readers for their ideas of the 30 
suggestions submitted freshmore was the most common but 
neophyte was the most emphatic 
neo would be neato since neophytos is greek for newly 
planted said david c king a political science doctoral candidate 
king said neophyte would be an easy term for students to pick up 
since it would be fun bastardizing greek 
if neophyte seems too esoteric other suggestions included 
firsty alphamore freshper rookie probationer collegian and 
tenderfoot 
one respondent suggested changing freshman would lead to 
substitutions for other masculine terms such as bachelors and 
masters 
walter harrison a spokesman for the ann arbor school said the 
university would consider dropping the term freshman if an 
acceptable replacement were found 
some colleges and high schools have started using fresher and

dec 7 is a date normally identified with the 
death and destruction at pearl harbor but for american and soviet 
diplomats it has also come to signify a momentous but littleknown 
development in eastwest relations 
it was on that day last year that the soviet union under heavy 
us pressure ordered the freighter vladimir ilyich back to its 
home port rather than deliver its cargo of four mi17 hip military 
helicopters to nicaragua 
that move is perhaps the clearest single piece of evidence to 
date of the soviets willingness to sacrifice the interests of an 
ally in order to advance the cause of superpower cooperation 
as washington saw it president mikhail gorbachev was long on 
words but short on deeds on many of his policies the recall of the 
freighter was by those standards an extraordinary deed 
it was one of the high points of what until now has been the 
largely untold story of the private exchanges that took place 
between washington and moscow on central america during president 
bushs first year in office 
a lengthy account of what transpired appears in the june 4 issue 
of time magazine 
in ordering the vladimir ilyich home the soviets put back on 
track a process in which the superpowers cooperated in promoting a 
free and fair election process in nicaragua culminating in the feb 
25 triumph of usbacked president violeta chamorro 
the result is that of all the regional conflicts in which the 
soviets and the americans became involved on opposite sides during 
the 1980s nicaragua angola afghanistan and cambodia only 
nicaragua has been resolved peacefully 
after a decade of bitter debate at home and with moscow as well 
nicaragua now has become in large measure an issue of secondary 
priority for washington the impossible actually happened following 
an honest election the leftist sandinista government of daniel 
ortega turned power over to the prous opposition 
on no issue had us policy changed more in the transition from 
presidents reagan to bush than central america 
to the distress of some old state department hands secretary of 
state james a baker iii seemed almost contemptuous of the 
nicaraguan contra rebels and less than enthralled by the overall 
issue of central america he appeared to spend all of his time 
dealing with europeans 
but as the time account suggests both bush and baker along with 
assistant secretary of state bernard aronson engaged in titanic 
albeit private struggles with the soviets on central america 
their strategy was to try to influence soviet actions in central 
america by threatening to deny them american goodwill in other 
areas in diplomatic parlance that connection is known as 
linkage 
not surprisingly the path to sovietamerican cooperation was 
bumpy the crucial period occurred in late november when addition 
to us concerns about hip helicopter shipments to nicaragua the 
sandinistas got caught trying to send 24 surfacetoair missiles to 
the leftist rebels in el salvador 
washingtons reaction was such that the soviets were afraid bush 
would call off the dec 2 summit with gorbachev in malta hoping to 
avoid a crisis in the summits aftermath the soviets recalled the 
vladimir ilyich 
things went more smoothly thereafter the soviets promised to 
urge cuba to limit weapons deliveries to central america and also 
assured washington that they would refrain from sending weapons to 
the sandinistas if mrs chamorro won 
in february baker and soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze pledged to respect the outcome of free and fair 
elections in nicaragua all along washington did its part by 
refusing to rearm the contras and by encouraging them not only to 
refrain from undertaking military offensives but also to join the 
election process 
a footnote the soviets eventually sent the hip helicopters to 
nicaragua at the end of january as a soviet analyst told time the 
kremlin felt a goodwill gesture was needed to ensure moscows 
continued ability to convince the sandinistas to stick by their 
pledge to hold honest elections 
the soviets did something else to placate washington they sent 
the helicopters equipped for civilian use only

arkansas gov bill clinton secured a 
solid majority to win his sixth straight democratic nomination but 
like a boxing champion who slipped by on points he is being asked 
to explain the lack of a knockout punch 
clinton 43 was the nations youngest governor when first 
elected in 1978 and he has had a stranglehold on the states 
democratic party ever since 
but in last weeks primary he garnered just 55 percent of the 
vote while tom mcrae an unpolished campaigner who heads a public 
policy think tank earned 39 percent four alsorans divided the 
rest 
clinton who toyed with the idea of running for the presidency in 
1988 and already is talking about 1996 said he saw no cause for 
concern in the margin of his primary victory 
i didnt see how i could get 60 percent knowing the number of 
people who were saying in the surveys that they thought i was a good 
governor but were concerned about the tenure issue clinton said 
recently 
tenure was summed up repeatedly by mcrae as 10 years is long 
enough 
arkansans grow bored with their politicians sooner than voters 
elsewhere clinton said in part because politics in the state is so 
personal pumping hands at shopping malls and crawfish festivals is 
considered as important as running the right television ad 
im just trying to tell people that in business they wouldnt 
fire a 43yearold with 10 years of experience whos doing a good 
job clinton said days before the primary 
sheffield nelson who upset rep tommy robinson for the 
republican gubernatorial nomination already is jumping on the 
theme saying arkansas is ready for a change 
clinton who has focused on improving the states education 
system counters by calling himself the candidate of change 
frankly if you look at what i proposed compared with the 
others it represents more change he said ten years is an 
asset not a liability 
clinton lost his first reelection bid in 1980 to republican 
frank white but won again in 1982 1984 and 1986 when the 
gubernatorial term was changed to four years he has all but 
promised not to run for the white house in 1992 if reelected this 
year 
his showing in this years primary largely in line with 
preelection polls was the first time since his political comeback 
in 1982 that clinton got less than 60 percent of the primary vote 
im sure the governor would like to have made a better showing 
but when youre in office 10 years you have a lot of friends and a 
lot of enemies said bill paschall a little rock political 
consultant i dont think its a death blow that he made 55 
percent but it shows him he has to work harder 
while the biggest complaint against clinton appears to be that he 
has been in office too long the governor also has been accused of 
being more interested in his national ambitions than state concerns 
clintons recent troubles with the legislature also have been a 
sticking point twice in 1989 he failed to win legislative approval 
for proposals to increase taxes 
nelson who hopes to paint clinton as a taxandspend democrat 
said the primary election results show the governor is on the ropes 
id say against an unknown who never held an office i think 
that was low it probably did make some bells go off in his head 
nelson said 
clinton said he would have done better if a large number of 
traditional democrats hadnt crossed over to the gop primary to vote 
against robinson 
we did poorly in areas where i did not campaign where my 
supporters in spite of my best interest believed the polls and 
didnt work and where we did a poor job of telling the people what 
i had done that affected their lives and where people knew there 
was an alternative but didnt know much about what the alternative 
was clinton said 
betsey wright clintons former chief of staff said the 
governors supporters were complacent 
bill clinton is always perceived as being so strong that people 
find it difficult to believe in calls for such cohesion and tight 
energies she said of the primary

a government study conducted for newsday and its 
union shows there is significant association between computer 
keyboard work and repetitive strain injury one of the researchers 
said thursday 
the study the first comprehensive survey of repetitive strain 
injury in the newspaper industry in this country also concluded 
that computer terminal use among workers at newsday and new york 
newsday presented a hazard to workers health it did not 
quantify or elaborate on the risks 
the study by the national institute for occupational safety and 
health and the university of michigan found no single cause for the 
injuries cincinnatibased niosh researcher susan burt said in a 
telephone interview 
she said several factors contribute to the risk of getting 
repetitive strain injury or rsi including 
repetitive motions like those made while typing on a computer 
keyboard 
work positions like extending the wrists up in an awkward 
position in order to type 
static position caused by holding arms up in order to type 
the study also found that how long a person worked at a keyboard 
without a break and how fast they typed contributed to problems 
associated with rsi we do not recommend working at a keyboard for 
extended periods without taking a break she said no specific 
time limit was given 
the study group included 834 workers at newsday and new york 
newsday they included reporters editors clerical and secretarial 
employees who worked in the editorial financial advertising and 
circulation departments 
burt said the employees were asked if they had experienced any 
pain aching numbness tingling or burning in their handswrists 
elbow shoulder and neck area within a 12month period 
by definition she said the pain had to last at least a week or 
occur at least once a month they also had to have no previous 
history of acute injury to the area and the pain had to have started 
on their current job 
survey results showed that 331 of the 834 employees or 40 
percent reported one or more symptoms in at least one of the four 
regions some time within the past year 
burt cautioned that the results were based on selfreporting and 
said niosh estimated they were twice as high than if we had done 
physical examinations as well as questionnaires 
of all the employees questioned she said reporters appeared to 
be at higher risk than the other workers 
some believed that the type of keyboard used may contribute to 
rsi but burt said we found no significant difference 
researchers did say however that work stations crowded with 
computers desks chairs and other equipment could contribute to the 
problem 
repetitive strain injury is listed as the leading cause of 
occupational illness by the us bureau of labor statistics the 
bureau said 115400 cases of rsi were reported nationwide in 1988 
representing 48 percent of all workplace illnesses 
the malady has been reported in a wide range of workers including 
office employees assemblyline jobs and within the meatpacking 
industry 
the study was requested by newsday and the graphics communication 
international union local 406 which represents nearly half of the 
newspapers 3100 fulltime employees 
burt said they began their research last august the report is to 
be released in a few days it was given to newsday and its union 
leaders on tuesday and the results were published wednesday 
researchers recommended that newsday establish a labormanagement 
committee to handle rsi problems and train employees on how to use 
adjustable equipment and change their work habits 
assistant managing editor robert keane said the newspaper has 
already initiated those recommendations 
john mcdonald vice president of the unions editorial unit said 
further studies may be done to show how individual work habits and 
equipment contributes to rsi 
burt said the agency is beginning work on two more studies on rsi 
at the los angeles times and us west a large telecommunications 
company

congress and the pentagon are ending months of 
haggling with an informal agreement to save tens of thousands of 
military jobs by shifting money from major weapons programs 
including landbased missiles 
defense secretary dick cheney and house speaker thomas s foley 
late thursday decided to give the pentagon the authority to transfer 
about 15 billion from weapons programs to payroll accounts 
the money will allow the defense department to avoid dismissing 
thousands of men and women by october the funds also will make up 
for a financial shortfall in the health insurance plan for military 
dependents the civilian health and medical program of the uniformed 
services 
among the reductions are 8 million from the mx railgarrison 
missile program 10 million from the midgetman missile 20 million 
from the trident missile submarine and 20 million from the seawolf 
attack submarine 
the tentative accord puts an end to bitter squabbling between the 
pentagon and rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed 
services committee 
however rep william dickinson of alabama ranking republican on 
the armed services panel accused aspin of holding the process 
hostage to a package of weapons cuts that is significantly less than 
what the chairman sought 
what the speaker and the secretary finally agreed on bears 
little resemblance to the chairmans demands consequently one 
cannot help but wonder what was accomplished by all this in the 
end dickinson said in a statement 
aspins press secretary lynn reddy said the chairman had no 
immediate comment 
such shifts of money known as reprogramming are 
customarily submitted to the house and senate armed services 
committees and the two chambers defense appropriations 
subcommittees 
in this case cheney had authority to proceed on his own and he 
had threatened to do so if no agreement were reached 
the pentagon said it needed the transfer authority to avoid 
massive layoffs that would have been required under the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law 
it estimated that it would have to discharge up to 68000 of its 
21 million uniformed personnel and deny enlistment to as many as 
115900 potential recruits among other steps unless given relief 
earlier this year aspin with the backing of foley declined to 
bring the pentagon request before his committee he argued that 
president bush could have exempted military personnel from the 
grammrudman law but decided against it last year 
aspin charged that bush favored weapons over people 
as a solution aspin proposed some of cheneys favored weapons 
programs including the b2 stealth bomber the strategic defense 
initiative the mx missile and the seawolf submarine as a source of 
funds for the personnel accounts 
all total aspin called for 230 million from the strategic 
programs cheney and foley reached a tentative agreement on 58 
million from those weapons systems as well as about 14 billion 
from other programs 
late last month cheney said he had the agreement of the chairmen 
and ranking members of the respective committees with the exception 
of aspin 
dickinson said he was pleased that men of common sense like 
dick cheney and tom foley were able to find a solution 
unfortunately its one that shouldnt have taken six months to 
arrive at

a new exhibit in budapest recalls the 
shadow of stalinism that covered half of europe for more than 40 
years 
it is called stalin rakosi and is the first in eastern 
europe to depict the daytoday life of the 1950s 
hungarys stalin was matyas rakosi who was installed by the 
soviet dictator and ruled unchallenged stalin died in 1953 byt 
rakosis reign lasted until the 1956 uprising against stalinism 
which was crushed by soviet tanks 
the exhibit constructed like a labyrinth is in a castle on a 
hill above the danube river it includes newspaper headlines 
photographs uniforms of feared men soiled clothing of the beaten 
and belongings of the executed 
emil horn who conceived it said he wanted to juxtapose the 
truth and the rakosi regimes representation of itself 
those days were very sad he said in an interview now 
there is a great irony 
a giant reprint of a cartoon from the period depicts mice 
marching behind a placard of a grinning cat next to it are equally 
large photos of hungarians marching behind portraits of rakosi and 
stalin 
the exhibit focuses on the rakosi era but repeatedly draws 
comparisons with the soviet union showing nearly identical 
uniforms medals and even constitutions 
a castbronze head of rakosi adorns a threetier podium 
recalling the cakes each village factory and school sent him on his 
60th birthday 
the podium is piled high with presents handstitched banners 
painted vases and flasks depicting the glories of communism there 
is sheet music of hymns to the leader 
up a few steps in a mausoleumlike chamber are even more 
elaborate gifts to stalin 
the exhibit also notes differences between stalinism in the 
soviet union and hungary 
here it lasted only seven to eight years horn said due 
to the liberal trends in hungary czechoslovakia and the whole 
region it would have taken much longer to completely suppress the 
people than in russia 
horn is a former communist who believed firmly in marxism when 
the soviets liberated hungary about what came later he said we 
are ashamed of ourselves 
his exhibit contains my personal selfcriticism as well horn 
said for me it is a kind of absolution i didnt hurt anyone 
but still it is absurd that i and so many people were so stupid 
why was i so ignorant millions of people in eastern europe 
are asking themselves that question 
in his new years address president vaclav havel of 
czechoslovakia said all czechoslovaks shared responsibility for 
communist rule and cautioned against simply blaming leaders for the 
excesses 
an exhibit about czechoslovakias history since 1918 opened in 
prague last month it is part of a general effort in what once was 
the soviet bloc to express the truth of history and strip away 
stalinist falsehoods 
budapests rakosi exhibit shows how the communists rigged the 
1947 elections then chronicles the dissolution of other parties 
collectivization of land and experiments in economic 
selfsufficiency that even included a shortlived attempt to grow 
cotton 
the second part of the exhibit has the atmosphere of an 
interrogation chamber courtroom and prison camp 
documents listing charges against prominent victims of the rakosi 
regime are displayed along with photographs and personal belongings 
they include cardinal jozsef mindszenty and former interior minister 
laszlo rajk who was hanged as a titoist 
in a depiction of the notorious labor camp at recsk where many 
people died are huge prints of photos taken secretly by an inmate 
who now lives in the west 
a small cabinet displays such banned materials as carlo collodis 
pinocchio disney cartoons and the jungle book by rudyard 
kipling 
looming over the exit is a border guard tower bearing two 
figures 18000 the number of people allowed to travel outside the 
country in 1951 and 10 million the number in 1989 
across from the tower are statues of rakosi and stalin toppled 
as they were after protesters pulled them down at beginning of the 
uprising oct 23 1956 stalins fist is in the dirt 
one visitor wrote in the guest book thank god we havent seen 
this in our lives another wrote below unfortunately we have 
still another echoed horn im ashamed that the hungarian 
people were willing to accept all this for decades

st patrick may have chased the snakes from 
ireland but unlike the winner of an upcoming contest here he 
didnt get a pickup truck for the accomplishment 
thats what this pacific island is offering to the person who can 
collect the most brown tree snakes in a onemonth period starting 
june 23 
the first annual sweep snakes contest is part of an effort to 
rid the us territory of the more than 2 million brown tree snakes 
that have infested the 212squaremile island 
the snakes were accidentally imported to guam during world war 
ii possibly in military cargo shipments from the solomon islands 
since then they have decimated the native bird population and are 
known to bite humans occasionally 
although the venom is not lethal to adults it can put small 
infants into shock and if untreated can cause death 
other prizes in the contest include awards for the longest tree 
snake captured and the most innovative trap

when are you bringing him 
back my frightened sister asked a security policeman on june 16 
1986 the day the police detained me under national emergency 
regulations decreed four days earlier 
dont worry well bring him back soon he said soon 
turned out to be nearly three years 
when the police came no one tried to keep them out the 
emergency empowered them to kick in the door anyway 
after hearing of the detention of other journalists i thought of 
going into hiding but after moving from house to house looking for 
asylum i eventually came home how does a journalist go into 
hiding i asked myself 
the next night the security police left with me i had a jacket 
a pair of jeans and a woolen hat 
algoa park police stations offices were as busy that night as a 
black hospitals casualty ward we sat on the floor of the cold 
waiting rooms until we were fingerprinted and photographed 
ja brian you write a lot in the papers said one of the cops 
to me making me feel like a little boy in a cage 
one of the horrible experiences you go through in detention is 
that of being divorced from your family your colleagues and the 
outside environment 
inside the police station i was kept with about nine other 
people in a filthy tiny cell with blankets full of lice we slept 
on the floor 
each day we got cold porridge in the morning two thin slices of 
bread and black coffee served in a big tin for us to share 
no one knew where we were as we were denied newspapers visits 
pens and even clothes to change i had to use my tshirt as a 
washrag on occasion my jeans and lumber jacket made perfect pajamas 
a major breakthrough came sometime in july when we developed 
various sorts of ailments colds ulcers backaches some of us 
were admitted to livingstone hospital and were able to smuggle 
letters to our parents and bribe guards with food and money to get 
visitors 
during that period a detainee would be called for hours of 
interrogation one young detainee about 16 years old came back 
sobbing 
theyve beaten me up he said he also told of being 
subjected to electric shocks 
it seems the police were trying to prove that i was a 
revolutionary journalist who during the 1985 consumer boycott took 
pictures of people who broke the boycott of white businesses 
according to police allegations i took the pictures to the 
peoples militia 
i went to the grahamstown supreme court to try to prove the 
police wrong the case was dismissed but i still have to pay the 
costs 
what they could not do was to charge me with a crime 
later i was transferred to st albans prison the difference 
between the police station and prison was that we were entitled to 
have money clothes and visits 
prison breaks one physically and psychologically and solitary 
confinement is a method of torture 
i spent three days in a tiny underground cell which was like 
being buried alive you see no car hear no noise on occasion a 
policeman walking on a floor above looks at you through a window 
when you are escorted inside by police your shoelaces are taken 
away when you try to sleep you are constantly awakened by police 
who say they are guarding against you killing yourself 
the strain is tremendous i suffered from depression and had to 
be brought back to st albans 
what kept us going for those years of hardship collective 
decisionmaking consultation a political program 
ironically the structures crushed by the state in the african 
townships were revived in prison we had an education panel a 
political panel and sport 
we had to bribe wardens and hardened criminals with money to get 
us newspapers we even smuggled a small radio to listen to the news 
numerous struggles for our release were waged inside and outside 
prison in february of 1989 there was an 11day hunger strike it 
proved to be instrumental in bringing about our release

new evidence that architecture is going to the 
dogs canine critics at an exhibit of designer doghouses turned up 
their wet noses at the modernist bauwauhaus and licked their 
chops over a dog cabin made of waterproof dog biscuits 
dog biscuits thats the secret to good doghouse design said 
russ post who held the leash of a tan labrador retriever old 
boris here really perked up when he saw them 
old boris didnt seem to like much of anything else on display 
outside the cooperhewitt museum which challenged architects and 
designers to build a better doghouse for an exhibition that opens 
friday 
but the dogs who attended a preview of the luxury doghouses 
thursday were confronted with the same architectural woes that dog 
human clients cost overruns selfindulgent designs ignorance of 
the clients needs 
their masters forced them into the doghouses for the benefit of 
photographers but the dogs seemed unimpressed 
cooper a tan lab puppy had to be forced into the sleek 
gleaming white bauwauhous after one look around the spare cold 
corian plastic interior he scampered out 
dora a black lab pup sniffed around but refused to enter the 
iglooshaped guardian dog house possibly because of the 
250pound sculpture of a winged dog perched on the roof 
ernie an adult lab bumped his head as he tried to walk into 
lassie come home a junked television console that was turned 
into a doghouse by smart design inc 
to get an idea of how someone could try to pass off an 
architectural joke as doghouse listen to smart designs tom dair a 
talented designer of products such as toasters and sunglasses 
there was no client we didnt have to sell it so we thought 
wed have some fun he admitted we basically decided dogs dont 
care where they sleep you see them under a tree in the dirt so 
it didnt make sense to go into some laborintensive process 
inspired by the sight of a discarded television cabinet on a 
harlem street corner dair and his colleagues bought a similar one 
for 40 painted it blue and equipped it with corrugated fiberglass 
roof 
what does it sound like when it rains he was asked 
i dont know he shrugged 
at this point boris walked by he glanced at the console with its 
rabbit ears antenna thats a joke boris and made a sound that 
sounded like a grunt 
fortunately he could not read the designers explanation 
television has become mans best friend dependable lovable and 
entertaining 
the two most popular houses the dog cabin and dog house in 
the mayan style both built with dog biscuits are impractical 
because the inhabitants would either eat them or be frustrated by 
their inability to do so the cabins biscuits are covered with 
eight gallons of polyester resin waterproofing 
the temple contains 400 pounds of dog biscuits russ post kept 
boris on a tight leash and told him we cant have you salivating 
every time you walk in front of the mayan temple 
each architect was given 1000 with which to build but almost 
everyone spent far more michael macleod said he spent his share 
just on the dog bones that he stuck in the walls of his guardian dog 
house 
other doghouses seemingly designed more to amuse humans than 
shelter animals included a pyramid the cheops doghouse a 
classical temple for fido dont fence me in which is 
entered through a door that looks like a hole in a fence and the 
mythologically inspired trojan dog built in the shape of a dog 
at least none of the doghouses looked like a fire hydrant which 
may explain why none of the canine critics resorted to their 
ultimate insult 
the show runs through oct 14

josef stalins henchmen used people already 
condemned to death to test cloakanddagger methods of execution 
including poisoned food or poisontipped walking sticks a newspaper 
revealed 
this weeks moscow news also detailed the arrest of stalins 
secret police chief lavrenti beria in 1953 saying the late soviet 
leader leonid i brezhnev strapped on a pistol and helped nab beria 
in the kremlin 
the portrait of brezhnev who came to power 11 years later is 
surprisingly positive given current criticism that he led the 
country to decay until his death in 1982 
beria was executed in december 1953 nine months after stalin 
died by a handful of soviet officials who feared he would use his 
brutal methods to seize power 
moscow news produced excerpts from the indictment against beria 
which alleged he and two underlings were responsible for carrying 
out experiments on live people 
seeking methods to use various poisons to carry out secret 
murders beria organized a secret laboratory to carry out 
experiments on soviets who were sentenced to death the newspaper 
said 
scientists at the secret laboratory poisoned their victims 
through food a prick from a walking stick or injections the 
indictment said 
at least 150 people died that way the indictment said 
a few dozen more were poisoned in hideouts in moscow ulyanovsk 
saratov the carpathian region and the ukraine the indictment said 
it quoted a statement from the head of the laboratory identified 
only as maironovsky as saying of those he poisoned i dont know 
their names i dont know what they were guilty of 
millions of people were condemned to death for alleged 
antisoviet activities during the years of stalin 
soviets for years could only whisper among friends about the 
repressive era but many details of the terror have become public 
for the first time in the soviet union under president mikhail s 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness 
as details emerge many soviets increasingly are seeing little 
difference between stalin and adolf hitler whose nazi germany has 
been characterized here for decades as the epitome of evil 
memoirs of marshal kirill moskalenko who arrested beria were 
preserved for decades and published by moscow news 
he recalled how he was summoned to the kremlin in june 1953 by 
future soviet leader nikita s khrushchev and asked to lead a band 
of men who would arrest beria at a government meeting 
they were armed because the secret police chief had his own 
wellarmed guard 
moskalenko said that when asked to choose several trustworthy 
officials who could take part in the arrest he chose brezhnev whom 
he recalled as a brave general a political worker dedicated to 
the communist party and the people 
brezhnev was given a pistol by defense minister nikolai a 
bulganin which he carried when the group burst into the meeting 
room on a prearranged signal to arrest beria the secret police 
chief did not resist and was executed after lengthy questioning 
brezhnev ousted khrushchev as soviet leader in 1964 and now is 
criticized for permitting what gorbachev calls a period of 
stagnation to settle over the soviet union

leaders of the senate ethics committee 
preparing triallike proceedings against sen dave durenberger say 
they may delve into the motivations behind the minnesota 
republicans financial dealings 
committee chairman howell t heflin dala and vice chairman 
warren b rudman rnh said thursday durenberger could agree in 
the case that many facts involving key financial transactions are 
not in dispute 
the committee could then turn to the intent behind those moves 
rudman and heflin said at a news conference on procedures for the 
hearings which begin tuesday and could last two weeks 
durenberger already has acknowledged errors in judgment in his 
personal finances but he told constituents last december it was 
never my intent to circumvent the senate rules or circumvent them 
for my own benefit 
the committee previously announced it found substantial 
credible evidence of financial wrongdoing by durenberger 
some of the allegations cover transactions from 1983 to 1989 
relating to a minneapolis condominium that durenberger partly owned 
and for which he received senate reimbursements 
other charges are connected to money collected by durenberger in 
promoting two books he wrote and his acceptance of free limousine 
rides these alleged violations took place in 1985 and 1986 
heflin said durenbergers intent is one of the elements wed be 
considering thats an element among many elements 
rudman added durenbergers motivation also could be considered in 
determining whether punishment should be applied 
both senators said there has been no plea bargaining that could 
result in a settlement before the case runs its course 
were not in the nature of trading rudman said 
senate rules however dont preclude a settlement at any point 
in the ethics process that could lead to the full chamber debating 
durenbergers fate 
a conviction could bring punishment ranging from a mild rebuke to 
expulsion although the senates ethics history indicates it would 
take a criminal conviction to get expelled 
durenberger was elected in 1978 to fill an unexpired term he won 
reelection in 1982 and 1988 his current term expires after 1994 
durenberger has spoken little about the case publicly in the last 
several weeks and in an interview thursday with wccotv in 
minneapolis he offered no predictions on the outcome of the case 
this is new for me as it is for the committee and for a lot of 
you and i think well all get our answers beginning next tuesday 
he said 
when the hearings are completed special counsel robert bennett 
will report to the panel which then would make recommendations to 
the senate

senate sponsors of an omnibus crime bill with 
curbs on semiautomatic assault weapons say odds are better than even 
they can save their measure despite their failure to limit debate 
my gut tells me that something will break and well end up with 
a bill sen joseph r biden jr ddel said thursday after 
talking with republicans about a possible compromise 
the senate voted 5737 in favor of limiting debate on the bill to 
30 hours but the tally fell three votes short of the 60 required in 
this case 
biden floor manager of the measure then pronounced the bill 
dead but within an hour he was scrambling to revive it 
republicans met to discuss a plan by sen strom thurmond rsc 
to drop provisions that would in some cases allow courts to consider 
evidence gathered with flawed warrants and create an organized crime 
and drug division within the justice department 
thurmonds plan would allow each party to offer 12 amendments but 
keeps the rest of the bill intact 
democrats later agreed to explore the republican plan 
the bill contains remnants of a crime package sent to congress by 
president bush a year ago but largely rewritten since then the 
administration now has little good to say about the measure 
democratic leaders said they needed a limit on debate to push 
ahead with floor action on the bill they pointed to 300 pending 
amendments and described them as filibuster fodder 
they said attempting to debate each of the 300 amendments would 
create openended delays that would prevent the senate from voting 
on the bill 
those favoring curbs on assault weapons blamed pressure from the 
national rifle association for the failure of efforts to limit 
debate it certainly was the major reason said sen paul simon 
dill 
but others scoffed at the notion that fear of nra retaliation at 
election time was the reason it wasnt in my case im leaving 
here said sen gordon humphrey rnh who is retiring at the 
end of this year 
in the days before the vote the nra blanketed gun owners in 
eight states with mailings criticizing senators who in a vote two 
weeks ago supported the bills gun provisions 
it said for example that sen tom daschle dsd betrayed 
every honest gun owner in south dakota by voting for it because 
daschle bought the big antigun media lie that gun control equals 
crime control and has now joined ted kennedy and the national 
gun ban crowd 
the nra mailing was identical in other states with only the 
senators name changed 
it called on gun owners to contact the senators state offices 
and provided telephone numbers 
daschle issued a statement telling south dakotans that as a 
hunter and gun owner i am against gun control period 
lets be realistic he said taking a couple of very small 
steps to try to deal with the drug killers who use these assault 
weapons is not going to hurt a single lawabiding south dakota 
sportsman

after a bloody revolution a 
contentious election and a damaging earthquake romanians now face 
the next upheaval in their lives the move to a market economy 
ion iliescu the only former communist popularly elected to lead 
an east european nation has promised to transform romanias 
centralized economy to a freemarket system 
but just how iliescu carries out this pledge slowly or quickly 
superficially or extensively will provide the first solid evidence 
of whether romania moves down the road to westernstyle democracy or 
sovietstyle reform communism 
western diplomats intellectuals and opposition politicians said 
the first clue will come later this month when iliescu announces his 
new government it will reveal whether the economy is still being 
run from the top in the old communist style they said 
muzzled by communism for 44 years the romanian people know their 
future is at stake 
unfamiliar with making points through westernstyle political 
dialogue they are still resorting to the shouting violence and 
volatility of decembers revolution and the recent election campaign 
the frustrations are now exploding its like a carnival after 
a period of fasting said culture minister andrei plesu a leading 
dissident before decembers popular revolt which ended nicolae 
ceausescus 24year dictatorship 
an anticommunist protest which has blocked university square 
since april 22 simmers on despite a threat from the mayor of 
bucharest to clear the thoroughfare the demonstrators backed by 
about a dozen hunger strikers are demanding a free press 
independent television and a ban on excommunists like iliescu 
holding public office for 10 years 
while there are some new faces in high places many of the old 
communist party members who ran ceausescus government are still in 
key posts 
ironically iliescus staggering 85 percent landslide and his 
national salvation fronts winning twothirds of the seats in 
parliament may turn out to be costly victories 
iliescu wanted a coalition government to tackle the modernization 
of romanias faltering economy where production has fallen 30 
percent since the revolution but the opposition parties refused 
stelian tanase editor of the weekly 22 one of the most 
anticommunist newspapers said iliescu now will have to take all 
the responsibility for highly unpopular reforms 
iliescu also faces competing demands from his own supporters 
the workers and peasants the old base of the communist party who 
provided the bulk of his landslide voted for stability a slow 
transition to a market economy and no unemployment 
but the broadbased front is split between conservatives who back 
the goslow approach and reformers who want a speedy transition to 
capitalism 
there are other problems as well unresolved allegations of 
electoral fraud and intimidation ethnic tensions involving the 22 
millionmember hungarian minority the drafting of a new 
constitution and preparing for new elections in about two years 
as if romanians didnt have enough to worry about the country 
must spend more than 25 million for emergency repairs from an 
earthquake last week that killed 14 people and injured 1000 across 
central and eastern europe officials say 
predicting two years of terrible complications plesu said the 
winners are those who are already losing it is not a very 
glorious victory 
during the election campaign many romanians said they didnt 
understand what democracy meant 
a cartoon by mihai stanescu romanias bestknown cartoonist 
shows a man holding a newly painted sign saying democracy and 
shouting into the telephone hello mr bush now what am i going 
to do with it 
a joke currently making the rounds in bucharest gives some 
indication of the lingering distrust of intellectuals for iliescu a 
onetime politburo candidate member who fell out with ceausescu and 
took the reins of power when the dictator was toppled 
in the joke president bush soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and iliescu are sitting in the back seat of a car bush 
tells the driver to turn right gorbachev tells him to turn left 
iliescu tells him to head right but turn left 
in the last days of the campaign iliescu said he didnt want to 
take undue risks in the transition to a market economy for fear of 
creating social problems 
but adrian severin secretary of state in the ministry of 
national economy who has emerged as a champion of radical reform 
said the interim government had prepared for a speedy and very 
deep reform of the economy without mass unemployment or soaring 
inflation 
he said he expected the legal and institutional framework for the 
transition to a free market to be completed in one year 
romania will promote the creation of small and mediumsized 
private business especially in agriculture and tourism he said in 
an interview 
within eight months severin said the government expects to turn 
state enterprises into autonomous companies which will be subsidized 
for several years and then either become independent or be 
dismantled if they cant compete

camouflage pants tshirts and combat 
boots are out straw sun hats cocktail dresses and manicured nails 
are in 
the new government of president violetta barrios de chamorro is 
sending clear signals that gentility is back in style no more 
sandinista revolutionary garb please 
the first clue came on the night of the inaugural ball at the 
former country club 
the dressedtokill crowd of uppercrust nicaraguans at their old 
haunt was something not seen in leftist nicaragua for more than a 
decade 
its like the great gatsby a south american diplomat said 
the morning after the ball 
he was referring not only to the fine gowns and designer shoes 
but to the refined manners and glittering atmosphere that left some 
people gaping 
these are people who either did not live in nicaragua because 
they were in miami or they lived here during the revolution as if 
they were living in miami said rosario murillo the wife of 
former sandinista president daniel ortega 
even in diplomatic circles a relaxed downhome attitude had 
been encouraged by the sandinistas themselves generally more at 
ease in nicely pressed combat uniforms and in workingclass barrios 
than in glitzy halls 
change is apparent all over managua 
the plaza of the revolution where the bourgeoisie used to be 
publicly scorned at sandinista rallies is now called plaza of the 
republic its presandinista name 
telephone operators now call customers sir and madame 
replacing the egalitarian comrade or the laidback honey of 
sandinista times 
some things from the old government remain a boulevard from the 
old country club to a shopping plaza retains its name ho chi minh 
avenue 
groups of young affluent nicaraguans fresh from miami in their 
stylish clothes flock to salvadoran restaurants where the walls 
bear proguerrilla posters 
men have started wearing coats and ties to important public 
functions 
i must admit i am a bit worried about that said a northern 
european diplomat 
i had gotten quite used to these clothes he said of his 
white cotton guayabera the latin american mens shirt of many 
pockets worn outside the pants it satisfied the dressiest dress 
code in sandinista nicaragua 
clothing style under the sandinistas was dictated by ideology and 
economic reality few had the money to dress up those who did were 
careful not to offend with clothes that bespoke a fatter pocketbook 
ms murillo perhaps carried to the extreme the sandinista 
rejection of middleclass conservatism in her usually flamboyant 
style of dress 
her husband on the other hand exemplified the politically 
correct dress with his signature camouflage uniforms 
ortega changed his image during the election campaign when he 
switched to cotton bomber jackets over black tshirts and tight 
jeans in an effort to woo younger voters to his cause 
he arrived at mrs chamorros april 25 inauguration wearing a 
redandblack print cotton shirt and black denim pants with the 
presidential sash in the blueandwhite colors of the nicaraguan 
flag draped over his chest 
next to him ms murillo wore skintight jeans huge earrings and 
kneehigh riding boots a baseball cap with a sandinista campaign 
slogan completed her outfit 
mrs chamorro a 60yearold grandmother wore an elegant white 
twopiece suit 
ms murillo is dismayed by a recent ban on miniskirts at the 
government complex 
the miniskirt long hair were revolutionary symbols ms 
murillo said she called the ban attempts against freedom 
a young sandinista woman who kept her job at the presidential 
house despite the change in government said the new clothing 
restrictions came as a shock 
we held a meeting and they told us that we couldnt come 
wearing sandals or culottes she said asking her name not be used 
for fear of being fired 
they said it was the new image we asked them if they were 
going to raise our salaries

a city ban on thongbacked swimsuits has 
prompted a rearguard action by devotees of the skimpy swimwear 
a couple of hundred demonstrators rallied thursday outside city 
hall to protest the ban including several young women sporting the 
swimsuits which leave the buttocks exposed no arrests were made 
last month police arrested five people on indecent exposure 
charges for wearing the gstring swimsuits at the citys lido beach 
touching off a debate at city hall that led to the may 22 ban the 
council voted monday to uphold the ban 
if convicted the five face up to to 60 days in jail but no 
court hearing has been set 
they cant think of anything else to do said michele larsen 
they have to complain something about us young kids 
others took a different view 
im a proud healthy virile 68yearold navy veteran of world

the wives and children of asbestos workers are 
dying of cancer at 1 times the rate of the general population and 
their only exposure to asbestos was the dust on the clothes of their 
husbands and fathers a study shows 
this finding of elevations in cancers really concerns us 
said the author of the study lou joubert of the american cancer 
society 
the study was described thrusday at a conference on the hazards 
associated with asbestos in place in schools and other public 
buildings 
in other studies alarmingly high levels of lung damage were 
found in construction workers who dont work directly with asbestos 
many previous studies have found elevated disease and death rates 
among workers who produced asbestos or worked with it the new 
studies find that asbestos is deadly even for construction workers 
who do not use it in their jobs 
high levels of asbestosrelated cancer were also found in school 
custodians in three separate studies suggesting that the asbestos 
hazard in schools is greater than anticipated said dr philip j 
landrigan of the mount sinai school of medicine in new york 
landrigan was one of the conferences organizers 
the hazard of asbestos in place is more than we anticipated 
landrigan said 
jacques dunnigan of the asbestos institute which represents the 
interests of canadian asbestos mines argued that canadian asbestos 
called chrysotile asbestos is less dangerous than other forms 
asked about the reports at the conference he said its very 
very poor science that im listening to 
asbestosrelated diseases lung cancer a lungscarring called 
asbestosis and a cancer of the lung lining called mesothelioma 
occur 20 to 30 years after exposure to asbestos 
asbestos was widely used as insulation in schools and other 
buildings during the construction boom of the 1950s and 1960s and 
so asbestosrelated diseases are just beginning to appear 
these diseases now cause about 10000 deaths per year said dr 
stephen m levin also of the mount sinai school of medicine 
joubert studied 878 children and wives of men who worked at a 
nowclosed asbestos plant in paterson nj of the 115 that have 
died 38 percent died of cancer compared with an expected death 
rate of 20 percent to 25 percent in the general population 
dr laura welch of george washington university in washington 
found that 40 percent of sheet metal workers who do not use 
asbestos in their work had asbestosrelated lung damage a 
precursor of asbestosis or cancer they were exposed to asbestos on 
construction sites welch said 
landrigan found the same asbestosrelated lung damage in 
firefighters with at least 20 years of service their rate of lung 
damage was seven times that of the general population the 
firefighters are typically exposed to asbestos when they enter 
buildings after fires have been put out he said 
levin reported the results of a study in which he and his 
colleagues examined 660 new york city school custodians 20 years 
after any possible exposure to asbestos the researchers found that 
28 percent of the custodians had asbestosrelated lung damage 
it was somewhat surprising he said we knew exposure 
occurred but while we expected to see some disease the rates 
surprised us similar findings were reported from independent 
studies in los angeles and boston levin said 
an article in science magazine in january argued that asbestos in 
schools and other buildings was not a significant hazard 
scientists at the new york conference were sharply critical of 
that article which they said was already causing some building 
owners and regulatory agencies to be less diligent in containing or 
removing asbestos

columbias astronomy mission with the 
150 million astro observatory is off until august because of a 
hydrogen leak making atlantis the next shuttle to fly nasa says 
atlantis is scheduled to carry a secret military payload into 
orbit in midjuly 
i do not have any problem at all moving atlantis out and 
preparing it for its next flight shuttle director robert l 
crippen said thursday i think weve got a situation that is safe 
to go fly and if we do not we will have evidence of that that will 
be very clear to us 
columbias upcoming flights will be pushed back in an orderly 
fashion crippen said a scientific research mission scheduled for 
august is now set for december pushing columbias december mission 
with a microgravity laboratory into next year 
the national aeronautics and space administration will move 
columbia from the launch pad back to the hangar next week so the 
hydrogen leak can be repaired the leak was detected as more than a 
halfmillion gallons of supercold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen 
were being pumped into the shuttle for last weeks launch attempt 
all of the checks and balances that we had in place worked just 
like they were supposed to work we were never in an unsafe 
condition crippen said 
a test wednesday confirmed nasas suspicion the leak is in or 
near a tight cavity between two metal plates that connect the 
orbiter and external tank the orbiter and tank will have to be 
disconnected a job that can be performed only at the hangar 
crippen said pipes and valves probably will have to be replaced 
in that area and another external tank used he declined to estimate 
how much the repairs will cost and how much the delay already has 
cost 
the problem were dealing with is unique weve never seen it 
before he said 
until we pull it apart and do some detailed troubleshooting on 
it well be unable to say specifically what the problem is 
crippen said the delay poses no risk to the astro observatory 
which consists of three ultraviolet telescopes and one xray 
telescope capable of examining some of the hottest objects in the 
universe 
it just has to sit on the ground for longer than we had 
desired he said 
the astro mission the first in five years dedicated entirely to 
scientific research already was two weeks late because of cooling 
system repairs the mission originally was scheduled for 1986 but 
was delayed by the challenger explosion 
discoverys flight in april with the hubble space telescope was 
two weeks late because of a malfunctioning power unit that had to be 
replaced at the launch pad 
crippen said mechanical problems are to be expected now and then 
flying the space shuttle is not like operating an airline and 
it never will be he said it is a very complex vehicle that 
is going to have problems show up periodically and yet it does offer 
us a way to get large payloads into space on a fairly frequent 
basis

a federal judge has ruled that us courts have 
jurisdiction over the palestine liberation organization 
us district judge louis l stanton made the finding thursday in 
deciding to let stand lawsuits against the plo stemming from the 
october 1985 hijacking of the achille lauro cruise ship 
the litigation included two lawsuits by passengers as well as 
claims by travel agencies that were sued by the estate of leon 
klinghoffer the 69yearold american who was shot to death in his 
wheelchair aboard the ship and thrown into the mediterranean sea 
the complaints allege the plo was responsible for the highjacking 
and seek to hold the organization liable for damages 
the plo sought dismissals on the grounds of diplomatic immunity 
and lack of jurisdiction it denied any involvement and said its 
chairman yasser arafat mediated a peaceful resolution to the 
hijacking 
the plos attorney ramsey clark said he would appeal the 
decision 
i do not believe the united states courts have jurisdiction 
over the plo clark a former us attorney general said 
the hijackers released the ship in egypt in exchange for safe 
passage to tunisia but their plane was forced down in sicily by the 
united states a man directing the hijackers from shore was released 
but four others were held by italy and subsequently sentenced to 
prison on weapons charges 
stanton rejected several of the plos arguments including that 
the issue of its liability for a terrorist attack was a foreign 
policy question not appropriately decided in the courts 
the seizure of a ship on the high seas poses no value judgments 
or debatable issues of the law of nations stanton wrote acts 
of piracy are clear violations of international law 
stanton ruled the plo had no immunity from this litigation 
because of its status as an observer at the united nations 
any acts for which the plo could be held responsible in these 
cases did not occur in connection with its observer function he 
said 
the judge also settled jurisdictional questions by ruling that 
the plo did business in manhattan at its united nations mission and 
therefore could be sued in new york 
the plo has purposefully established a permanent and extensive 
presence in new york stanton said while the united states 
strictly limits plos activities it still has constant and 
substantial contacts here 
stanton also ruled that the plo was properly served with the 
complaints 
the klinghoffer lawsuit in federal court claims the owner and 
charterer of the achille lauro and travel agencies did not take 
sufficient steps to prevent a hijacking or warn passengers of the 
possibility 
jay d fischer the klinghoffer attorney said the estate also 
has a lawsuit pending in state court alleging that the plo was 
responsible for klinghoffers death 
this decision vindicates the view of the klinghoffer family 
that the us courts constitute the appropriate forum for the 
determination of legal liability for the murder of leon klinghoffer 
aboard the achille lauro fischer said

president fw de klerks 
lifting of the 4yearold state of emergency met with some criticism 
on both sides here with blacks calling it a half measure and 
rightwing whites warning the president he had gone too far 
de klerks action thursday an effort to pave the way for 
blackwhite negotiations on dismantling apartheid ended some of the 
harshest political restrictions ever imposed by the countrys white 
rulers 
the net result of the lifting of the state of emergency is that 
one of the main stumbling blocks to constitutional negotiations 
has been removed de klerk told parliament in cape town 
in paris african national congress leader nelson mandela called 
the development a victory for the people but he said he would 
continue to urge western governments to maintain economic sanctions 
against pretoria 
he also criticized the retention of the state of emergency in 
natal province de klerk said that province will remain under 
emergency rule because violence there cannot be countered with the 
ordinary laws of the land 
anc leader walter sisulu said the state of emergency had done 
nothing to stop the fighting in natal where about 4000 blacks have 
died in the past four years the main combatants are supporters of 
the anc and members of inkatha a relatively conservative zulu 
organization 
we are not asking for half measures sisulu told a news 
conference what we have asked for is to clear the atmosphere to 
negotiations that was not done 
the anc has said the lifting of the emergency the release of 
political prisoners and the return of exiles are the main obstacles 
to full negotiations 
the proapartheid conservative party meanwhile said the end of 
the state of emergency would lead to chaos and further alienate 
rightwing whites disgruntled with de klerks reforms 
he no longer speaks for the white people he claims to 
represent said clive derbylewis a conservative spokesman 
but business groups and world leaders heaped praise on de klerk 
the white house called the lifting of the emergency a sign of 
the remarkable progress in recent months in south africa and 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said it was a 
positive development 
during the state of emergency more than 30000 activists most 
of them black were detained without charge for varying lengths of 
time thousands more went into hiding after former president pw 
botha imposed the restrictions on june 12 1986 
about 300 activists were being held under the emergency 
regulations as of thursday most of them in natal 
in announcing the end of the state of emergency de klerk also 
held out the prospect for other reforms 
he said the government was considering changes to security laws 
that could possibly inhibit the free conduct of peaceful 
politics and said he was taking unspecified actions that would 
allow thousands of exiles to return home 
the anc says it has more than 15000 exiled members 
de klerk also said that as a good will gesture he would 
release 48 prisoners convicted of politically motivated crimes the 
anc has said there are some 3500 inmates it considers political 
prisoners 
de klerk wants to work out a new constitution with opposition 
groups that will lead to powersharing between the 5 million whites 
and 28 million blacks who under apartheid have no voice in national 
affairs 
midlevel officials from the anc and the government worked out a 
joint program on the obstacles to negotiations last month and 
submitted the plan to the leaders on both sides 
de klerk said the government has accepted the plan and is ready 
to implement it but the anc has asked to delay its response until 
july 10 details of the plan have not been released 
the president challenged mandela to stop advocating guerrilla 
violence he criticized mandelas recent statement that the anc 
approves of organized disciplined violence against chosen 
targets 
the end of the emergency is likely to make it more difficult for 
mandela to persuade foreign governments to maintain economic 
sanctions against pretoria 
french president francois mitterrand who met mandela in paris 
thursday met de klerk last month and indicated he would be willing 
to call for a reassessment of european community sanctions if the 
emergency were lifted political prisoners were released and exiles 
were allowed to return 
more than 20 opposition groups were banned and several 
antiapartheid newspapers were shut down temporarily during the 
emergency police repeatedly raided black trade union offices and 
broke up political meetings and demonstrations in black townships 
and university campuses 
de klerk in february nullified some of the restrictions as part 
of his reforms 
many of the emergency regulations are duplicated in existing 
security laws but the emergency decree allowed the government and 
police to bypass the courts 
existing laws allow for detention without trial provide 
authority to ban political meetings and permit the government to 
place restrictions on activists such as house arrest

the national rifle association opens its 
annual convention today with some of its supporters puzzled why a 
group known for its clout is suffering legislative defeats and a 
sharp loss in membership 
i think theres a great deal of frustration among the 
membership based on a very tough year said james j baker 
lobbyist for the 28 millionmember gun lobby based in washington 
dc 
once renowned for its political influence throughout the nation 
the nra has recently suffered legislative defeats in new jersey 
maryland and florida 
an estimated 20000 members will attend the convention in 
california which last year passed legislation banning more than 50 
types of militarystyle assault rifles 
on thursday the gun lobby scored a tenuous victory when us 
senate supporters of a wideranging crime bill with curbs on 
semiautomatic assault weapons failed to stop a filibuster 
democratic leaders blaming pressure from the nra for the failure 
of efforts to limit debate initially decided the bill was dead 
then sought a compromise to revive the measure 
the convention comes at a crucial time in the history of the nra 
along with legislative defeats the group has lost support among law 
enforcement and dropped an estimated 250000 members in four years 
baker blames the falloff in membership on a 10 dues increase and 
unknown factors but gun control advocates see a badly damaged 
organization 
over the last 12 months youre looking at the worst period in 
the nras existence said luis tolley western director of handgun 
control inc 
among the events on the convention agenda is a membership meeting 
saturday when the rank and file can question nra leaders on 
legislative losses 
californias clampdown on assault weapons came after five 
children were slain and 29 others were wounded in a schoolyard by a 
man with an assault rifle the man patrick purdy killed himself at 
the end of the jan 17 1989 attack in stockton 
california also now requires a 15day waiting period for the 
purchase of rifles and shotguns 
elsewhere maryland voters approved a referendum in 1988 that 
bans the sale and manufacture of cheap handguns known as saturday 
night specials 
in new jersey earlier this year gov james florio signed what he 
called the nations strongest ban on the sale and possession of 
assault weapons 
but baker asserts that despite those setbacks the nra retains 
influence using as an example the extension of the crime bill 
filibuster the nra had sent messages from executive director wayne 
lapierre to gun owners in eight states urging them to pressure their 
senators 
weve lost some battles baker said thursday the war is 
far from over you look at the votes in the united states senate 
this morning and i think that gives you the proof that you need 
robert ellison helping to set up a convention booth for sierra 
bullets blamed the nras troubles on widespread misunderstanding of 
gun issues rather than on the organizations internal shortcomings 
they do a good job and work in the best interest of members 
he said but the general public quite frankly isnt getting the 
right message

a unanimous senate foreign relations committee 
wants to slash by 80 percent president bushs request for money to 
tear down and rebuild a new us embassy building in moscow riddled 
with electronic bugs 
a 150 vote by the panel on thursday demonstrated anew that there 
is no consensus among policy makers about what to do with the 
eightstory white elephant 
in a drafting session called to deal with bushs request for 
additional money for the embassy and to pay pastdue us fees to 
the united nations sen daniel patrick moynihan called it 
humiliating and wasteful to tear down a nearly completed 
building that already has cost 60 million 
moynihan dny proposed instead to cut the state department 
embassy request for 270 million in the fiscal year starting oct 1 
to 50 million 
he said that would be enough to finish the current office 
building which could be used for nonclassified activities and to 
construct a secure bubble elsewhere in the embassy compound for 
sensitive intelligence and diplomatic activities 
during a brief discussion of moynihans amendment there was no 
dissent except from a state department representative who said the 
administration would strenuously oppose the move because it would 
compromise security at the site 
the administration wants to dismantle the building down to its 
foundation which would be left in place a new structure then would 
be built after a buffer layer is installed to insulate the new 
building from the foundation 
the structure would then be put to its originally planned use as 
the primary office building for the complex intelligence experts 
including the senate intelligence committee have endorsed that 
approach as the only secure one 
a similar bill awaiting house action includes the full 270 
million asked by the administration but defers the question of 
whether to raze and rebuild the office building until after 
negotiations are completed on purchase of additional land adjacent 
to the embassy compound 
a house foreign affairs committee staff report concluded that it 
is unnecessary and unwise to tear down the building because it 
could be put to use as staff housing which is in short supply in 
moscow 
it is unclear whether the legislation approved thursday by the 
senate panel will ever be enacted few major foreign affairs bills 
have survived the full legislative process in recent years 
work on the embassy building was halted in august 1985 after it 
was discovered that the structure had been permeated with soviet 
listening devices sources have said the united states still does 
not fully understand the technology used by soviet spies to turn the 
building into a giant microphone 
at least three outside consultants have done lengthy studies of 
what to do with the building and numerous internal state department 
and congressional studies have been performed more than a dozen 
different solutions to the problem have been considered

americas mightiest unmanned space 
rocket a titan 4 blasted off today with a secret military payload 
it was the second launch of a titan 4 the giant rocket boosted a 
missilewarning satellite into orbit in june 1989 
the rocket was launched at 122 am edt from cape canaveral air 
force station lighting up the sky as it thundered toward orbit 
the air force refused to discuss or even acknowledge the flight 
until about 20 minutes later when a statement was issued the 
payload was not disclosed 
this was an important launch for americas space program 
said martin c faga the air forces assistant secretary for space 
the titan 4 is the largest booster ever launched by the air force 
the titan 4 provides our nation a vital path to space for 
critical national security payloads 
john pike director of the federation of american scientists 
space policy project said the rockets cargo probably is a 500 
million electronic eavesdropping satellite capable of intercepting 
missile telemetry and radio communications 
a less likely possibility pike said is that it is a 
missilewarning satellite 
martin marietta space launch systems has a 71 billion contract 
with the air force to supply 41 titan 4 rockets with an option for 
eight more the air force ordered the rocket in 1985 to lessen its 
dependency on nasas manned space shuttle 
the shuttle is the most powerful cargo carrier used by the united 
states capable of putting a 52000pound payload into orbit the 
titan 4 an expendable launch vehicle can lift a 39000pound 
payload into low earth orbit or carry 10000 pounds to stationary 
orbit 22300 miles high 
the titan 4 stands 20 stories tall and is powered by two liquid 
fuel main engines and two solid rocket boosters one of the engines 
nozzles malfunctioned in last years launch but the other nozzle 
compensated and the rocket remained on target 
the air force plans to launch future titan 4 rockets from cape 
canaveral and vandenberg air force base in california 
ten titan 4 rockets originally were to have been launched by 
october the us general accounting office criticized the program 
in a report last month citing schedule delays and 209 million in 
cost overruns as of july 1989 
martin marietta said it is working to improve production and cut 
costs 
the denver company encountered problems with a commercial titan 3 
launch in march an engineering design error caused the rockets 
cargo an intelsat communications satellite to be placed in a 
uselessly low orbit 
intelsats board of governors will decide at a meeting in 
barbados this week and next whether to pay the national aeronautics 
and space administration for a shuttle rescue mission which could 
exceed 130 million the washingtonbased consortium of 119 
countries operates a global communications system 
a commercial titan 3 is scheduled to carry another intelsat 
communications satellite into orbit on june 21

a brief glance at the main issues 
in the czechoslovak elections today 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
whats at stake 300 seats in the twochamber federal parliament 
200 seats in the regional parliament of the czech republic and 150 
seats in the regional parliament of the smaller slovak republic 
the two republics have control over significant areas of public 
life including education culture and health care 
the federal parliament controls foreign affairs defense finance 
and the environment it also has to elect a new president virtually 
certain to be the incumbent vaclav havel after he appoints a new 
federal government based on the results of the election 
the chief task of the new federal parliament which like the 
regional parliaments will sit only for two years is to draft a new 
czechoslovak constitution 
this should remove the vestiges of four decades of communist rule 
and will have to deal with rising separatist sentiment in the slovak 
republic where many people seek the eventual creation of a separate 
slovak state that could enter a new united europe 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
main political parties there are 22 parties competing in the 
elections although some are standing only in the czech or slovak 
republics 
the heavy favorites to emerge as strongest forces are the civic 
forum and its slovak partner organization public against violence 
who led last winters peaceful revolution against communist rule 
latest opinion polls give them 39 to 42 percent of the vote 
nationwide the second strongest force is the christian democratic 
alliance of three parties the peoples party and christian 
democrats in the czech republic and the christian democrat movement 
in slovakia 
the third strongest is the communist party which is given around 
10 percent in the latest preelection polls 
other parties likely to get the 5 percent minimum vote required 
for seats in federal or regional bodies are the environmentalist 
greens and the social democrats

president bush says he really likes the white 
house because theyve got good food there even if the job 
entails reading tons of paper 
the president reflected on his life as the nations chief 
executive thursday in a discussion with kindergarten through 
thirdgrade students at chicagos farnsworth elementary school 
he first discussed education and the war on drugs with a group of 
area principals and then read to a group of young students in 
observance of national literacy week 
you really like it or are you just saying that bush asked 
his young audience who clapped after he read from a childrens book 
something that his wife barbara does frequently in her efforts to 
promote literacy 
he told the kids to go home and tell their parents and 
grandparents to read to them more 
if you want to be president learn to read and try to keep 
going in the right direction bush said 
but he said theres tons of papers just endless numbers of 
papers to read i read so many i sometimes start reading 
backwards which is very bad to do because you dont understand it 
very well 
bush asked the students if they saw news accounts of the man 
from russia referring to soviet president mikhail gorbachevs 
recent visit to the united states you do things like that he 
said and you work with congress 
i like it a lot theyve got good food there bush said of 
life in the white house 
its fulltime work its very interesting its very important 
you work with important people in the white house bush said 
but its not all hard work he added noting that he and mrs 
bush like to walk their pet spaniel millie around the grounds 
after he finishes work in the oval office each evening

a good question bush said clearly stumped

more 
he said his favorite room in the white house was the oval office

the suicide machine used by an 
oregon woman to end her life has raised no new ethical questions in 
the netherlands where euthanasia is widely accepted advocates of 
mercy killing say 
there is no ethical or legal difference in the netherlands 
between direct euthanasia action by a doctor or a doctor simply 
providing the means to commit suicide theo van berkesteijn 
chairman of the royal netherlands physicians association said in a 
telephone interview 
janet adkins of portland ore died monday after using the 
suicide machine designed by dr jack kevorkian of michigan she had 
been told she was suffering from alzheimers disease 
the subject was discussed informally thursday as a 21nation 
euthanasia conference opened in the netherlands formal discussion 
is expected today 
kevorkians device has sparked a debate among american legal and 
medical authorities on whether it is legal and ethical for doctors 
to assist their patients in committing suicide medical regulators 
have joined prosecutors in investigating kevorkian 
but in the netherlands it has become widely accepted for 
physicians to go even further and personally administer lethal 
injections to terminally ill or suffering patients who have asked to 
die 
the physicians association has spearheaded a 15year campaign 
for full legalization of euthanasia on the grounds that mercy 
killing can be a humane medical practice and should not have to take 
place surreptitiously 
kevorkians machine is a technical innovation which brings no 
new ethical elements said pit bakker chairwoman of the dutch 
voluntary euthanasia society 
the eighth world conference of righttodie societies opened in 
the southern dutch city of maastricht on thursday to discuss legal 
and ethical issues surrounding euthanasia 
derek humphry the british executive director of the hemlock 
society a us righttodie advocacy group described kevorkian as 
a very brave pioneer who is trying to shock the medical profession 
into accepting voluntary euthanasia 
but he said that we dont think that dying in the back of a 
van 2000 miles from home is a dignified death 
mrs adkins 54 traveled from oregon to michigan because the 
state has no clear laws on doctorassisted suicide according to 
humphry kevorkian drove with mrs adkins to a park outside detroit 
and attached her to the electricpowered suicide device in the back 
of his van she pressed a button that delivered chemicals that 
stopped her heart and kevorkian said she was dead within minutes 
we accept this is what mrs adkins wanted because of the 
terrible euthanasia law in america humphry said 
although euthanasia is still technically a crime punishable by a 
12year prison term here physicians are rarely prosecuted as long 
as they follow a set of semiofficial guidelines that have received 
the tacit support of the government 
under the guidelines established by the physicians association 
doctors must make sure the patient has explictly asked to die and 
that relatives and other physicians are consulted before euthanasia 
is carried out 
berkesteijn noted that the adkins case raised the issue of 
whether informed consent could be obtained from a patient suffering 
from alzheimers disease an incurable disease that leads to 
deterioration of the brain 
euthanasia in the netherlands is and should remain a case where 
patients are fully lucid when they seek death he said 
last year a government euthanasia proposal was shelved 
indefinitely after the centerright coalition government of premier 
ruud lubbers collapsed over an unrelated issue 
the proposal was a compromise between the proeuthanasia liberal 
party rightwingers on most other issues and lubbers christian 
democrats 
the dutch christian democrats an amalgam of religiousbased 
political parties take pains to avoid antagonizing the conservative 
roman catholic and protestant communities 
lubbers wanted to avoid legalization but give government 
recognition to the status quo by codifying the existing guidelines 
his current centerleft coalition has ordered an investigation to 
determine the volume of euthanasia cases and their circumstances a 
move criticized by advocates as yet more political waffling on what 
has already become widespread practice 
estimates of the number of righttodie cases vary from a few 
hundred to 20000 a year in this nation of 146 million although 
experts stress thee are no reliable figures 
attending the conference are experts from australia belgium 
great britain canada colombia denmark france the netherlands 
greece india israel japan monaco new zealand norway portugal 
spain sweden south africa west germany and the united states

the worlds rain forests are being destroyed 
faster than previously thought an environmental research group says 
every year the world loses an area of tropical forests almost 
as big as the state of washington said james gustave speth 
president of world resources institute 
the report released thursday by the institute said data from 
satellites and ground sensors along with reports from individual 
governments indicate tropical forests are vanishing 50 percent 
faster than previously estimated 
the report citing 1987 data concluded that 40 million to 50 
million acres of tropical forests are stripped each year compared 
to the official estimate of about 28 million acres based on 1980 
data that still is used by the united nations and many governments 
deforestation is a major concern to scientists and 
environmentalists because tropical forests absorb carbon dioxide 
and therefore serve as a carbon sink for the manmade gas 
which contributes to global warming as forests disappear more 
carbon dioxide is allowed free to drift into the atmosphere where 
it and other manmade pollutants act much like a greenhouse and cause 
the earth to warm 
some scientists believe such warming if not checked will cause 
severe changes in weather patterns coastal flooding and economic 
disruptions by the middle of the next century 
allen hammond who headed the institutes research effort said 
the satellite findings and data from studies in several countries 
with vast tropical forests provide the first exhaustive look at the 
current extent of deforestation worldwide 
but other recent indications show that the official estimate of 
rainforest destruction based on data a decade old was far too 
conservative a study by a british scientists last year came to a 
conclusion similar to the institutes findings 
ken andrasko senior forestry analyst for the climate change 
office of the environmental protection agency said the definitive 
answer to how much forest were losing wont be available until 
next year when the un food and agriculture organization revises 
its rain forest destruction estimates 
andrasko said indications are that the updated estimates will 
reflect findings similar to the institutes report 
meanwhile official estimates on the extent of the deforestation 
problem continue to be based on the 1980 data for example the epa 
used the official data in drafting a policy options paper on global 
warming last year 
were talking about sparse official data that is credible 
hammond said he said he considers the institutes findings 
conservative 
according to the world resources institute report about 
onethird of carbon dioxide pollution each year comes from the 
destruction of tropical rain forests an additional 28 billion tons 
of carbon were released into the atmosphere in 1987 because of 
tropical deforestation the study said 
the report is based on data gathered in 1987 when deforestation 
in brazil which has the worlds largest rain forest was at its 
peak as much as 20 million acres of forest may have been destroyed 
in brazil that year the study said 
the brazilian government has since begun to curb deforestation 
but hammond said the destruction of the brazilian rain forest 
continues at a significant rate and deforestation elsewhere is 
increasing 
according to the 1987 data gathered in the institutes study 11 
countries were responsible for 82 percent of the worlds tropical 
deforestation brazil indonesia burma india colombia ivory 
coast thailand laos philippines nigeria and vietnam 
satellite sensing studies showed deforestation in india at 37 
million acres in 1987 10 times the earlier estimate the study 
said large areas of india legally still designated as forest land 
already are virtually treeless according to the satellite 
imagery said the researchers 
burma which was not among the top 10 countries in deforestation 
a decade ago now ranks near the top with 17 million acres of 
forests lost annually a 500 percent increase over 1980 
as a result of deforestation brazil in 1987 caused 12 million 
tons of carbon to be released about the same amount of carbon 
released by the united states from the burning of fossil fuels that 
year the study said

the departure of federal reserve vice chairman 
manuel johnson will have little immediate effect on interest rates 
economists say but it will give president bush another chance to 
put his stamp on the central bank 
johnson 41 unexpectedly announced thursday he will resign from 
the no 2 job at the central bank on aug 3 to return to an academic 
career 
bush who has been pressing the fed to relent and let interest 
rates fall to keep the country out of a recession will get his 
third chance to appoint someone to the sevenmember fed board 
earlier this year bush appointed david mullins a top aide to 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and reappointed edward w kelley 
jr originally appointed by president reagan 
early speculation pointed to wendy gramm chairman of the 
commodities futures trading commission as a likely nominee to 
succeed johnson 
but economists said the changes on the board would not chance the 
feds current tightmoney policies 
despite administration complaints federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan and his colleagues have been keeping interest rates high 
to dampen economic demand and reduce inflationary pressures 
this softlanding approach appears to be working economic 
growth has slowed but the economy has not dipped into a recession 
lyle gramley a former fed board member and now chief economist 
for the mortgage bankers association said fed policymakers 
including johnson had been supporting greenspans approach 
the bulk of policymaking officials are committed to bringing 
down inflation through a process that involves slow growth he 
said the fed isnt closely divided now where one vote in either 
direction would make much of a difference 
a published report in march quoted an anonymous bush adviser as 
saying the president was mad as hell at greenspan and predicting 
he would not reappoint the chairman when his term expires next year 
bush later denied the report but left no doubt he would prefer 
to see lower interest rates 
johnson had been considered one of the leading candidates for the 
chairmans job should bush decide to fire greenspan but thursday 
johnson said he fully supported greenspans reappointment in 1991 
and would decline any offer to succeed him at that time 
gramm the wife of sen phil gramm rtexas has opposed an 
administration effort on capitol hill to transfer the cftcs control 
over stock index futures to the securities and exchange commission 
her appointment to the fed would remove her from that debate 
others mentioned as possible candidates for a fed appointment 
were john taylor a member of the presidents council of economic 
advisers and treasury undersecretary robert glauber 
the administration is likely to choose some one out of the same 
mold as mullins a proadministration republican with an academic 
background said david jones author of a book on the federal 
reserve and chief economist at aubrey g lanston amp co 
johnson said he was leaving because he wished to return to the 
private sector 
the main reason i decided to step down is that i have spent 10 
consecutive years in public service he said ten years is long 
enough to serve in positions in government 
johnson was appointed to the fed by president reagan on feb 7 
1986 and was elevated to vice chairman six months later 
johnson said he planned to return to george mason university in 
washingtons virginia suburbs and assume the koch chair in 
international economics and become director of the center for global 
market studies 
he was a professor at the school in 1981 when he was selected to 
join the economics team in reagans first term

lawyers for john m poindexter are asking the 
judge to reject a prosecution request to send the former national 
security adviser to prison 
defense attorney richard w beckler argued in court papers filed 
thursday that imprisoning poindexter for lying about the irancontra 
affair would only unjustly extend the suffering he has endured 
for 3 years 
poindexter convicted of five felony counts stemming from efforts 
to conceal details of the irancontra affair from congress is 
scheduled to be sentenced monday 
the retired navy rear admiral who served as president reagans 
national security adviser from 1985 until his resignation when the 
affair became public in late 1986 could be sentenced up to 25 years 
in prison and fined 125 million 
but the defense urged us district judge harold h greene to 
reject a request by independent counsel lawrence e walsh that he 
order poindexter to serve a prison sentence for lying to congress 
this recommendation was made without the slightest reference to 
john poindexters lifelong career of service to his country and to 
his community beckler said of the retired navy rear admiral 
it is made without consideration of the heavy punishment that 
the more than threeyear irancontra investigation has already 
visited upon john poindexter and his family the lawyer wrote 
to take him away from his family and the community he has 
served and can continue to serve would be fundamentally unjust 
the defense noted that all other irancontra defendants convicted 
of crimes including former white house aide oliver l north were 
given terms of probation 
if there is a distinction between these men and john poindexter 
which the court should consider at sentencing it is this whatever 
john poindexter has done his actions were always motivated by what 
he truly believed to be the best interests of the presidency of the 
united states beckler said 
poindexter 53 was convicted april 7 of making false statements 
to congress by denying that the white house staff was secretly 
helping to arm the contra rebels in nicaragua after congress had 
banned us aid 
he was also convicted of lying destroying and altering documents 
to conceal the us role in a 1985 shipment of israeli hawk missiles 
to iran 
reagan who gave a videotaped deposition that was played to 
jurors testified that he never authorized poindexter to break the 
law or lie 
prosecutors said the sentence must include a period of 
incarceration because the diet of lies poindexter fed congress 
did violence to this nations fundamental principles of 
government 
beckler said poindexter has suffered enough since the irancontra 
affair became public 
he has lost a bright and promising career in the united states 
navy he has endured the public ridicule of the congress and the 
media and he has suffered financial hardship the lawyer said 
most painful of all he has been convicted

thirteen surviving munchkins will follow a 
real yellow brick road this weekend to pay tribute to the star of 
the wizard of oz 
theyre off to see the birthplace of the late frances ethel gumm 
better known as judy garland who would have celebrated her 68th 
birthday sunday 
the diminutive actors and actresses will trek to grand rapids and 
walk down a yellow brick road built last year to honor garland who 
left the northern minnesota city as a youngster and was 15 when she 
starred as dorothy in the 1939 movie she died of a drug overdose in 
1969 
a parade and an exhibit of private photographs of garland are 
among the planned festivities as part of the weeklong judy garland 
festival 
its touted as the largest gathering of munchkins since 
metrogoldwynmayer released the movie about two dozen of the 124 
munchkins are still alive 
im especially glad to be here with all my old pals said 
jerry maren 69 the only surviving member of the lollipop guild in 
the movie the threemember guild welcomed dorothy to munchkinland 
by giving her an enormous striped lollipop 
the munchkinland scene lasted only 10 minutes but it took nearly 
seven weeks to shoot and helped make the movie a classic 
most of the munchkins earned just 50 a week for their services 
they paid toto more than they paid me quipped former 
munchkin fern formica 
meinhardt raabe who played the coroner who pronounced the wicked 
witch of the east dead said the munchkins didnt know much about 
the rest of the movie while they worked 
we didnt have the script all we had was the script for 
munchkinland after we left they shot the rest of the picture 
in his book the munchkins remembered stephen cox says 
gathering more than 100 midgets under one roof would be nearly 
impossible to repeat today 
unlike dwarfs midgets have bodies that are proportionately 
correct and advances in hormonal treatment now enable them to grow 
to nearnormal stature 
there just arent enough little people any more maren said 
wistfully formica said he doesnt think the wizard of oz is 
dated 
i think itll be around for another 50 years he said i 
feel like someone much larger than us has had his hand on it from 
the very beginning

chancellor helmut kohl of west germany 
urged the united states to participate actively in rebuilding 
eastern europe and envisioned an openborder europe in which 
nations had overcome mutual prejudice 
in an address thursday at harvard universitys commencement 
ceremonies kohl reaffirmed that the border between germany and 
poland should remain intact but open 
we germans do not want to couple the unity of our fatherland 
with the displacement of existing borders he said kohl had drawn 
protests when he last visited the united states early this year over 
his refusal to categorically rule out a shift in borders 
kohl who received an honorary doctor of laws degree said europe 
and the united states needed to develop more intense political 
connections possibly through new institutions in ensuring the 
success of europes drive toward unification 
my message today is this germanamerican friendship is a 
decisive prerequisite for europe and america managing to cope in 
unison with the tasks of the future said kohl who meets today 
with president bush at the end of a fourday visit 
the europeans and americans must together elucidate their 
vision of a better world in which coming generations can thrive 
he said 
kohl painted an optimistic portrait of an economically and 
politically prosperous europe that could dispense with borders 
the united states of europe will form the core of a 
peaceful order in which the nations of the old continent finally 
overcome former rivalry chauvinist thinking and mutual 
prejudice he said 
europe of the future will be a continent of diversity that 
affords the regions and nations new opportunities for 
selfdevelopment this naturally includes above all the protection 
of ethnic cultural and religious minorities 
kohl drew appreciative applause in stressing the importance of 
german unification for the human political and economic gains of 
europe 
unification of germany will impart a strong impetus to the 
process of european integration which will result not least in an 
economic upswing from which many will benefit he said 
events in europe he said must not distract attention from the 
problems of the third world of the need to preserve the environment 
and to continue to work for human rights and selfdetermination 
around the world

few american students are hooked on books and 
even fewer possess essential writing skills according to a 
congressionally required study 
the national assessment of educational progress popularly known 
as the nations report card said few school students in grades 
four eight and 12 have actually mastered reading and writing 
mainly because most parents dont work with them at home and few 
teachers require much reading or writing in class or for homework 
even more troubling are the wide gaps in achievement between 
whites and minorities said roy truby executive director of the 
national assessment governing board 
the average assessment on the writing test for 12thgrade blacks 
is only slightly better than the average for fourthgrade whites 
hispanics are nearly as low 
on the reading exam on the other hand which was primarily 
multiplechoice the average black or hispanic 12th grader performed 
at about the same level as the average for eighthgrade whites this 
has been the pattern in many previous exams 
no student should be allowed to go through the education system 
without mastering the essential skills of reading and writing 
said christopher cross of the education department which released 
the study 
the data underscore the urgent need for parents and teachers to 
foster essential literacy skills through daily practice cross 
said 
key results were 
the average reading proficiency of schoolchildren increased 
substantially from grade four to grade eight and somewhat less 
dramatically between grades eight and 12 in general students 
appeared to have great difficulty with explaining what they had 
read but less difficulty with questions asking about overall 
meaning and specific details 
students reported doing very little reading in school and for 
homework at all three grade levels assessed 47 percent to 61 
percent reported reading 10 or fewer pages each day for schoolwork 
across the curriculum 
sixtynine percent of the fourth graders reported watching three 
hours or more of television each day while less than half 46 
percent reported reading for pleasure on a daily basis 
about onethird of the eighth and 12th graders reported that 
they never discuss reading at home these students had significantly 
lower reading proficiency 
eighthgrade english teachers reported that 45 percent of their 
students wrote papers of a paragraph or two weekly and only 14 
percent wrote a one or twopage paper each week only 6 percent 
wrote papers of three or more pages each week 
truby said the 1988 assessment data released thursday was based 
on different tests than those reported earlier for measuring trends 
the writing assessment gave students more time to write out some of 
their responses up to 30 minutes in some cases instead of the 
previous 15minute limit 
truby said the longer format in the writing test raised the 
average performance result for white students but had little effect 
on the scores of blacks and hispanics 
as a result the racial gap appears wider on the writing exam 
than on other naep assessments 
the study also found that children who had preschool classes in 
reading scored higher than those who did not but the racial gap is 
slightly greater for those with preschool experience than for those 
without 
naep released the first reading and writing reports in january 
the two studies present additional findings from a national 
sample of 13000 students in reading and 20000 students in writing 
as well as information from fourthgrade reading teachers and 
eighthgrade writing teachers

mayor marion barry is open to talks on a 
possible plea bargain agreement in his cocaine and perjury case 
jesse jackson says 
jacksons comment thursday followed a lunch meeting with barry 
who later denied a report that he would announce in the next day or 
two that he wont seek reelection 
barry refused to discuss the meeting with jackson as he left the 
federal courthouse where jury selection for his trial continued 
but barry did address the suggestion of an imminent announcement 
that he wont seek reelection 
if you hold your breath youll die the mayor said through 
spokeswoman lurma rackley he added there was no truth to the report 
broadcast on a local television station 
the mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor counts of 
cocaine possession three felony counts of lying to a grand jury and 
one count of conspiracy 
negotiations leading to a guilty plea on one or more of the 14 
charges have stalled sources close to barrys legal team say 
but barry is open to talks as opposed to a drawingtheline 
situation jackson said in a televised interview after he met with 
the mayor 
i am rather convinced the mayor is inclined to do something 
to break the cycle and break the tension jackson said i hope 
it happens sooner than later 
barrys lawyers and the prosecutors are nowhere right now in 
terms of plea bargaining one source familiar with the situation 
said 
its increasingly unlikely that we will have any agreement 
soon said the source speaking on condition of anonymity 
jackson associates say he has been urging barry for six weeks not 
to seek reelection and to strike a plea bargain with the government 
the jury selection process continued in barrys trial with 13 
prospective jurors sent into a pool from which a panel of 12 jurors 
and six alternates will be chosen 
the total number of prospective jurors in the pool now stands at 
37 us district court judge thomas penfield jackson said he would 
continue the selection process through the end of next week it 
likely will take that long to question over 200 prospective jurors 
who have filled out questionnaires for the case

as animal rights activists prepared for a 
weekend march in the nations capital federal health officials 
turned up the verbal heat branding as terrorists the protesters 
who storm research labs 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan said he 
refused to be intimidated by the violent tactics of some animal 
advocates and predicted they will not succeed because they are on 
the wrong side of morality 
sullivan said animal research has saved millions of lives and 
holds promise for new therapies to treat devastating illnesses like 
alzheimers disease 
it would be evil to forsake animal research when lives hang in 
the balance he said at a news conference thursday 
he said he was saddened and a bit angry that we have to put up 
with major disruptions to science by socalled animal activists who 
are in fact nothing more than animal rights terrorists 
medical schools are spending about 6 million annually for damage 
from breakins at research labs and other disruptive activities and 
for tighter security the association of american medical colleges 
said 
sullivan said virtually everyone agrees that unnecessary animal 
research or the cruel use of animals is wrong but he said such 
incidents are rare because of regulations that require humane 
treatment of animals 
activists responded that supporters of animal research were 
perpetuating the myth that animals must be sacrificed to improve 
human health 
responsible medical professionals should be promoting quality 
research and effective disease prevention not aligning themselves 
with pork farmers and other industry groups whose policies erode 
human health the physicians committee for responsible medicine 
said 
the animal advocates said sullivan was ignoring the continuing 
exploitation of laboratory animals that suffer while alternative 
nonanimal testing methods are available 
animal rights activists plan to gather in the nations capital on 
sunday to march for the animals which is being coordinated by 
the national alliance for animals educational fund 
the march will focus on all kinds of animal exploitation from 
their use in medical experiments to zoos and circuses and embrace 
varying ideologies from those who would protect all animals all 
the time to those with more moderate views 
we try to encourage legislation to put an end to abuse of 
animals said rebecca mcginley events coordinator for the march 
there are some people who want larger cages and some who want no 
cages we want to embrace all the people who are concerned its 
not an event to force issues on people 
ingrid newkirk national director of people for the ethical 
treatment of animals said she is morally opposed to exploitation 
of any individual or group of individuals who cannot fight for 
themselves 
so i believe there is always a way if you look to get 
information without using animals she said 
she said sullivan was wrong in claiming that inhumane treatment 
of research animals was rare 
we cant even get them to stop cutting off the toes of rabbits 
to identify them she said

a landscape of teen pregnancies illegal drug 
use and violence threatens the health and wellbeing of the nations 
adolescents a commission of health medical and business leaders 
said today 
the commission in a report assessing the health of american 
adolescents concluded that young people are less healthy and less 
prepared to take their places in society than were their parents 
among the troubling signs cited by the panel were 
1 million teenage girls nearly 1 in 10 get pregnant each 
year 
39 percent of high school seniors reported they had gotten drunk 
within the two previous weeks 
the suicide rate for teens has doubled since 1968 
teenage arrests are up 30fold since 1950 
homicide is the leading cause of death among 1519 year old 
minority youths 
unhealthy teenagers are unlikely to attain the high levels 
of education achievement required for success in the 21st century 
the commissions report said 
thousands of these young people will experience school failure 
which for many will be a precursor to an adult life of crime 
unemployment or welfare dependency the report said 
the commission was formed by the national association of state 
boards of education and the american medical association to make 
recommendations on the role of the school and community in improving 
adolescent health 
the 37 panel members included former surgeon general c everett 
koop pollster george gallup jr former education commissioner 
ernest boyer illinois gov james thompson and california school 
chief bill honig 
the commission recommended that all teenagers be guaranteed 
access to health services regardless of their ability to pay this 
health care should include psychosocial as well as medical 
services the report said 
also communities should set up adolescent health centers in 
schools or other convenient locations financed by local state and 
federal funds as well as by private money 
the report did not estimate the cost for these services 
it also called on schools to play a larger role in improving 
adolescents health it suggested a new kind of health education 
a sophisticated multifaceted program that goes light years beyond 
present lectures about personal hygiene such a program should 
include sex education the panel said 
the commission calls upon this nation to recognize that 
adolescents will not achieve their potential if they have social 
emotional and physical health problems that interfere with their 
learning and that they will cost society millions of dollars in 
medical and social costs if they continue to engage in 
healthrisking behaviors the report said 
the future is bleak if we do not invest more in our nations 
greatest resource our young people

a collegebound vietnamese high school 
student who failed an english test by a single point wont be 
allowed to graduate with her peers 
no exceptions are made on the districts competency tests which 
all students must pass to graduate said superintendent pat sandro 
im sure people would say just give her the test again 
sandro said but if you dont have standards where do you draw 
the line 
ngocnu lam spoke virtually no english when she arrived from her 
native vietnam six years ago she has a b average at union high 
school and has been accepted at ferris state university where she 
hoped to study computer science 
the 21 year old said she canceled her order for a cap and gown 
for thursday nights commencement after hearing she would not be 
allowed to participate 
i would like to march with the others said lam who also 
skipped an honors ceremony earlier this week in which she was to 
receive the presidential academic fitness award 
sandro said lam can retake the test in august but lam and 
supporters are urging sandro to have the test regraded or allow her 
to retake it immediately they say the wait might jeopardize college 
financial aid even if she passes 
peggy chancehicks a grand valley state university tutor who 
works with lam in a bilingual student program said lam failed the 
conversational english part of the test in which students read a 
paragraph and rewrite it conversationally 
conversational english is one of lams weaknesses since her 
family speaks chinese or vietnamese at home chancehicks said 
she said the way the section is graded may have an inherent 
cultural bias 
when the test becomes a barrier to a student who through 
their own tenacity and selfperseverance will become a success 
then it is a problem chancehicks said

a candidate vaccine produced by genetic 
engineering fights the virus that produces aids researchers at 
johns hopkins university have reported 
the vaccine uses genesplicing techniques to produce a chain of 
proteins mimicking a portion of the surface of the human 
immunodeficiency virus hiv the cause of aids 
vaccines against viruses usually are made of the whole virus 
crippled so that it cannot cause the disease in question or killed 
virus 
the johns hopkins team reported its work thursday in science the 
journal of the american association for the advancement of science 
the candidate vaccine was injected into eight volunteers four 
times over 18 months an initial injection followed by three 
boosters 
at the end of 18 months three of the eight had developed a 
response in which the cells of their immune systems attacked the hiv 
virus and the cells it infected 
they did so without attacking the socalled innocent 
bystander uninfected cells of the immune system a major problem 
in aids research 
the test vaccine is a long way from being shown to be a possible 
weapon against aids further clinical tests which could take years 
to complete must be conducted before the vaccine could be used

the chinese embassy on thursday called the student chai ling 
a criminal wanted by the chinese public security department

near the virgin islands for a small plane missing since tuesday with 
one woman aboard 
the piper 28 aircraft was en route from the dutchfrench island 
of st martin to st croix in the us virgin islands when it 
disappeared fred farrar a spokesman for the federal aviation 
administration said thursday night 
a piper 28 is a singleengine plane and the distance from st 
martin to st croix is about 100 miles 
farrar identified the pilot as mary pomeroy he said that details 
were sketchy but that it was believed that ms pomeroy was a british 
noblewoman possibly known as the countess of malta or duchess of 
malta 
reference books on the british nobility list one rosamond mary 
pomeroy the sister of thomas de vautort pomeroy 10th viscount of

surprised to learn she was feared to be missing at sea 
she said a woman who once lived with a cousin of hers on another 
caribbean island legally took the name pomeroy decades ago but she 
had no idea if this was the missing pilot 
its absolutely nothing to do with our family the harberton 
family because we would know miss pomeroy said unless its 
this woman who took the name by deed poll when she was living with 
as cousin of mine in st kitts and nevis at least 30 years ago 
the missing airplane left st martin about 305 pm tuesday 
flying under visual flight rules farrar said the pilot radioed

4500 feet and that was the last transmission from the plane 
a squall line had been reported between st martin and st croix

a federal judge rebuffed a group of states and 
cities led by new york city that challenged commerce department 
guidelines for deciding whether the 1990 census should be adjusted 
to compensate for any undercount 
judge joseph mclaughlin upheld the guidelines which the group 
including new york state los angeles california and other 
governments had argued were biased against the very idea of a 
statistical adjustment 
the census is intended to reach and count every person but 
critics argue that distrust and fear of government among some 
minority groups particularly immigrants and the poor ensure they 
will be undercounted 
mclaughlin said the guidelines were not biased but said some of 
the criteria lend themselves easily to abuse he warned he would 
not tolerate any backdoor attempts by the commerce department 
which runs the census bureau to make an unfair decision about 
whether to adjust the count 
the census is used to decide the amount of federal aid each city 
and state gets it also determines representation in congress and 
state legislatures 
the general counsel of the commerce department wendell willkie 
ii said his agency was extremely pleased with the judges 
decision 
under the guidelines upheld by the judge it is up to the 
secretary of commerce robert mosbacher to decide whether to make 
the statistical adjustment 
the guidelines do not set technical standards but state among 
other things that an adjustment must not violate the us 
constitution 
the commerce department must decide for or against adjustment by 
july 15 1991 
state attorney general robert abrams said his department had 
wanted the guidelines struck down but said we are nevertheless 
heartened by his stern warnings to the department that a decision 
not to adjust will be closely scrutinized 
mayor david dinkins who has said the guidelines all but 
precluded an adjustment said he hoped the commerce department would 
fulfill its obligations for a complete count 
it is an especially heavy burden because it is impossible for 
the department to explain why a census intended to count every 
american fails to count so many he said

prime minister yitzhak shamir was ironing out 
lastminute obstacles to forming a narrow rightwing government 
today and hoped to meet a sundown deadline an aide said 
if shamir manages to pull together a rightwing cabinet it would 
replace the coalition between his likud bloc and the centerleft 
labor party that collapsed more than 2 months ago 
israel radio reported early today that shamir had apparently 
pulled together a coalition later however its reports became less 
certain as meetings dragged on between the prime minister and 
potential coalition partners 
likud officials said shamir had support from 62 members of the 
120seat parliament but news reports said lastminute differences 
with ultraorthodox religious parties could upset the coalition 
shamir spokesman yossi ahimeir said shamir who is caretaker 
prime minister expected to sign a coalition agreement with at least 
eight small farright and religious factions in his office later 
today 
with firm agreements shamir would be able to fulfill the legal 
requirement of informing president chaim herzog that he has a 
government then a vote could be scheduled in the knesset or 
parliament to install the new cabinet 
if shamir succeeds the knesset would likely be convened on 
monday 
the 42 days given shamir to form a government technically end at 
midnight but the jewish sabbath begins at sundown 
the coalition agreement was being held up by a disagreement 
between two religious parties the national religious party and the 
ultraorthodox degel hatorah over control of the religious affairs 
ministry 
another ultraorthodox party shas or the torah guardians was 
given the interior ministry but asked for one more important cabinet 
post it reportedly rejected the economy ministry as not prestigious 
enough 
national religious party leader zevulun hammer came to shamirs 
office today and said he would discuss his differences with degel 
hatorah 
the staterun radio reported that key posts in the new cabinet 
have already been assigned 
it said the foreign ministry would be headed by david levy now 
housing minister and a chief rival to shamir for leadership of 
likud the defense portfolio would go to shamirs closest ally 
current foreign minister moshe arens it said 
former defense minister ariel sharon will get the housing 
ministry and head a group of ministers dealing with immigration the 
radio said sharon as defense minister in 1982 engineered the 
invasion of lebanon 
in the last election in november 1988 likud won 40 seats and 
labor 39 forcing them into a socalled national unity government 
despite their deep philosophical differences 
the coalition collapsed in a parliament vote of noconfidence on 
march 15 after likud rejected labors demand to accept a us 
proposal for peace talks with palestinians 
news reports have said the 74yearold shamir would prefer 
another coalition with labor in a rightwing government he would 
be squeezed between us pressure to move forward with the peace 
process and the farrights refusal to do so 
after the governments collapse labor leader shimon peres failed 
in a 35day effort to form a leftleaning government shamir was 
given the mandate on april 27 
the delicate coalition bargaining has involved a number of small 
parties each with different views the national religious party and 
shas each have five seats in the knesset and degel hatorah has two 
the lengthy bickering has raised demands for political reform to 
end the system under which tiny parties hold the balance of power 
late thursday police clashed outside the prime ministers office 
with protesters shouting they wanted an end to political 
extortion

a battle between two jungle tribes armed 
with arrows spears machetes and poison darts in central peru has 
left at least 48 people dead authorities said 
the battle involving at least 1000 members of the ashaminka 
tribe and 200 members of the campos tribe took place monday near 
the andean jungle town of satipo about 160 miles east of lima gov 
andres galarza flores of the junin department said thursday 
witnesses said as many as 200 people died in the battle with 
most of the bodies thrown into the perene river galarza said 
police investigating the battle found only three bodies but 
confirmed that 48 people had died galarza said 
reports of the battle were delayed because there are no phones in 
the area and transportation is slow galarza said 
the two tribes are longtime rivals and have had earlier 
confrontations over rights to grow coffee and coca in the area he 
said 
politics also may have played a part in the battle galarza said 
the ashaminka are solidly behind presidential candidate mario vargas 
llosa while the campos support his rival alberto fujimori vargas 
llosa faces fujimori in a runoff sunday 
witnesses said the battle started when a large truck entered the 
ashaminka town of yarividoni during an important tribal festival 
an ashaminka watchman found up to 200 heavily armed campos hidden 
under a tarp on the trucks flatbed witnesses said the chief of the 
ashaminka then ordered his men to attack galarza said 
there were unconfirmed reports that both sides also used 
grenades dynamite and rifles as well as their traditional weapons 
in the battle which lasted more than four hours 
the ashaminkas captured 10 of the campos who were later turned 
over to police 
there also were reports that militia groups from neighboring 
towns joined with the ashaminka in battling the campos 
many tribes in the region have wellorganized militias peruvian 
soldiers have set them up to help tribespeople protect themselves 
against maoist shining path rebels

boy that elliot sure has problems with women 
and hes not shy about revealing them at least not to a theater 
audience 
they are chronicled in exhaustive detail in elliot loves 
jules feiffers selfabsorbed comedydrama about the neverending 
struggles between male and female 
the play starring anthony heald and christine baranski and 
directed by mike nichols opened thursday at offbroadways 
promenade theater its a disappointment considering the stature of 
the playwright the cast and the director what starts out as a 
promising look at how the sexes survive each other turns into a 
narrowly focused and theatrically static evening about some not very 
nice or even interesting people and their not very nice or 
interesting problems 
feiffers dialogue is flip and occasionally very funny his 
characters make wry witty observations almost too witty to be 
real the oneliners would be more at home in the playwrights 
brilliant weekly comic strip than in a fulllength play 
feiffers hero is a fortyish chicago polltaker divorced and 
trying to establish a relationship with joanna a slightly ditsy but 
accommodating woman 
ill never do better shes good for me he tries to tell 
himself and us in the plays opening monologue if only hed listen 
to himself but elliot has hangups about love not to say guilt 
about establishing a commitment to someone new 
the distance between what i need and what im getting is 
love he theorizes its that distance or gap that elliot focuses 
on the one thing in his lessthansatisfactory life that has 
quality shape and substance 
to validate his relationship with joanna elliot takes her to 
meet his three best friends she charms them but not before old 
wounds are opened up and the men reveal their bitterness about women 
and each other 
the unlikely buddies include a recovering alcoholic a black 
editor at playboy and a misogynistic accountant who has had the 
pleasure of driving his spouses car over a cliff how he survived 
is a question the play doesnt address 
the party ends disastrously with elliot verbally attacking the 
alcoholic the nicest and weakest of his three friends it seems 
inconsistent with his personality which until then has been morose 
but not malevolent 
the boyish heald is miscast as the guiltridden elliot theres 
no sense of worry in his performance he seems foolish rather than 
frantic the sexy personable baranski exudes a flaky likability as 
she prepares for the dinner party and nervously tries to memorize 
details about the men she is about to meet 
bruce a young oliver platt and particularly david pierce as the 
sad sack alcoholic offer some strong support latanya richardson is 
wasted in an unnecessary role as one of the mens wives 
nichols direction is determined not letting the plays momentum 
falter until the very end part of that motion is due to designer 
tony waltons stylish set of a highrise apartment that spins with 
great ease 
the plays final scene is a tedious telephone conversation 
between a drunken elliot and joanna as they try to patch up their 
tattered relationship it nearly stops the play dead as elliot 
keeps reiterating his love for the protesting joanna 
after a while you want to shake the selfcentered man and tell 
him to get on with his life thats because theres a lingering 
suspicion the only person elliot really loves is himself 
the reviews by new york newspaper critics were generally poor 
most scribes were put off by the characters and the letdown after 
an excellent opening monologue 
frank rich in the new york times howard kissel in the daily news 
and linda winer in new york newsday all disliked elliot loves 
clive barnes of the new york post enjoyed it 
feiffer asks theatergoers to spend an evening with empty 
characters without offering the payoff of insight said rich 
adding that he found the play bleak and unsatisfying 
if elliot loves were as compelling as entertaining as 
thoughtful as its opening monologue it would be altogether 
remarkable wrote kissel 
theres enough material in the monologue to make a harrowing 
and wonderful play the heartbreak is that somehow that play never 
got written winer opined 
rich kissel and winer all thought the acting was superb 
in the post barnes raved elliot loves in its 
comparatively modest sketchlike way seems totally successful not 
to mention hilarious i promise you you will laugh and laugh

a federal judge gave los angeles county 20 
days to submit a plan for remapping districts to give hispanics more 
representation but did not rule whether tuesdays election results 
will stand 
us district judge david kenyon on thursday warned he will do 
whatever is necessary to devise a redistricting plan if the board 
of supervisors fails to meet his june 27 deadline 
i do believe time is important here he declared 
supervisor mike antonovich who attended the federal court 
hearing told reporters 20 days was insufficient time to hold public 
hearings on the issue antonovich is one of the boards conservative 
majority which voted to appeal kenyons decision mandating new 
districts 
hispanics make up an estimated 35 percent of the countys 87 
million people but no hispanic has been elected to the board since 
1875 
liberal supervisors have called for a settlement that would 
increase the number of districts and supervisors to offer more 
representation 
kenyon did not rule whether tuesdays election results in two 
supervisor races should be voided but he remarked the court 
would note that none of the candidates ran without full knowledge 
that this lawsuit was pending 
on monday the day before the election kenyon found the five 
board members had conspired to protect their incumbencies and that 
of their allies when they redrew the countys five voting 
districts in 1981 
the lawsuit filed in august 1988 charged that the supervisors 
deliberately spread the countys hispanic population across several 
districts when they changed voting boundaries following the 1980 
federal census 
attorneys for the american civil liberties union and the mexican 
american legal defense and educational fund which joined the us 
justice department lawsuit on the matter said kenyons order put 
those results in doubt 
obviously the implication is that tuesdays election doesnt 
really mean anything said richard fajardo a maldef attorney 
remember that election took place under an unconstitutional 
plan

nasa has scrubbed a 700 million 
program to build an orbital space tug designed to service 
satellites including the hubble space telescope 
the national aeronautics and space administration said 
budgetary pressures and the lack of a firm nearterm 
requirement for the spacecraft influenced its decision 
william b lenoir nasas associate administrator for space 
flight said the space tug eventually will be needed in our space 
infrastructure but we will have at least two or three years to 
develop firm requirements before it will be necessary to begin 
development 
the agency did not cite what budget constraints compelled it to 
cancel the program 
the tug or orbital maneuvering vehicle was to have been a 
remotecontrolled reusable spacecraft performing satellite service 
and retrieval missions 
in addition nasa planned to have the vehicle periodically boost 
the hubble space telescope into a higher orbit around earth 
begun in the 1980s the project employed 280 people at trw incs 
space amp defense sector facility in redondo beach said company 
spokeswoman julie meier wright the companys portion of the program 
totaled 400 million 
workers will be reassigned at the facility which employs 17900 
people she said

leaders of the warsaw pact say they want to change 
the sovietled alliance from a military to a political body by this 
fall reflecting the reduced eastwest tensions in europe 
after meeting thursday in moscow the pact leaders declared their 
readiness for constructive cooperation with the north atlantic 
treaty organization 
nato foreign ministers concluding two days of talks in scotland 
today welcomed the statement by their longtime rival 
we are ready to contribute actively to building confidence and 
closer relations between all european countries including the 
members of the two alliances a nato statement said 
members of the kremlinled warsaw pact alliance also discussed 
various roles for a united germany in europe said soviet deputy 
foreign minister yuli kvitsinsky but he indicated there was no 
agreement 
the members said they favor the formation of a new 
alleuropean security system and the creation of a single europe 
of peace and cooperation without artificial barriers and 
ideological hostility 
participants in the meeting are unanimous in their opinion that 
the ideological enemy image has been overcome by mutual efforts of 
the east and the west the declaration said 
the warsaw pact meeting came as the old structure of the 
35yearold alliance is crumbling in the wake of last years 
democratic upheaval and the ouster of hardline communist regimes in 
eastern europe 
in light of the changes it has become necessary to reconsider 
the character and functions of the warsaw treaty the members said 
in their declaration 
new proposals on such a transformation will be drawn up before 
the end of october 
soviet and east european sources familiar with the thinking of 
government leaders have said that the envisioned new structure of 
the pact would be patterned roughly after the nato secretariat and 
council in brussels although no firm plans have been disclosed 
warsaw pact members include bulgaria czechoslovakia east 
germany hungary poland romania and the soviet union 
the declaration said a commission will work out proposals on 
transforming the alliance before the end of october and the 
political consultative committee the group that met in moscow 
thursday will examine them before the end of november 
despite statements before the meeting by hungarian prime minister 
jozsef antall that he wants to remove his country from the alliance 
kvitsinsky said there wasnt a single statement made relating to a 
wish to quit the pact 
czechoslovak president vaclav havel too said upon returning to 
prague that he stressed that his country should remain in the pact 
in order to oversee its transformation 
pact members also heard a detailed report by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev on his washington summit last week with 
president bush 
havel and his foreign minister jiri dienstbier also indicated 
there was no agreement on future security arrangements for a united 
germany 
the soviets oppose nato membership for a united germany and 
gorbachev and bush failed to resolve their differences over the 
issue last week

black was the color of national arts 
awareness day at the fuller museum of art 
staff members wore black thursday and they used a black band to 
cordon off an exhibit of pieces loaned by bostons museum of fine 
arts 
the idea they said was to warn that the museum may not be able 
to afford some exhibits if federal and state funds are cut back or 
eliminated 
the cordonedoff gallery now showing classical furniture 
borrowed from the boston museum with money from the national 
endowment for the arts will be closed if grants stop the museum 
said 
fuller officials said the museum will have to cut its staff or 
operating hours if its allocation from the massachusetts cultural 
council is cut from the 30000 this year to 15000 next year as 
the massachusetts house has recommended 
we feel a sense of loss said james keneklis director of the 
fuller our demonstration is in support of the nea and a request 
to congress to renew its fiveyear term without limiting funding 
bills have been introduced in congress and the state legislature 
that would prevent the national endowment for the arts and the 
massachusetts cultural council from making grants to institutions 
exhibiting art considered obscene or offensive

us ambassador john mccarthy urged rebel 
gen michel aoun to step down and recognize the government set up 
last year under an arab league peace plan a newspaper reported 
today 
the forces of aoun and militia chieftain samir geagea skirmished 
today with mortars and machine guns in east beirut police said one 
erson was wounded by sniper fire in the ashrafiyeh district before 
the exchange ended 
the fighting violated a shaky ceasefire that was called may 17 
to halt more than four months of intrachristian clashes for 
dominance of a tiny enclave northeast of beirut 
the power struggle between the rival christian forces began jan 
30 and has killed 1036 people wounded 2772 and forced about 40 
percent of the christian enclaves 1 million population to flee 
their homes 
th newspaper addiyar reported that mccarthy said he told 
president elias hrawi in cairo early this week of the us 
administrations support for the legal lebanese authority to 
enable it to carry out its responsibilities 
hrawi was elected president nov 24 in line with an arab 
leaguebrokered peace accord to end lebanons 15yearold civil war 
the peace plan was worked out by lebanese legislators in the saudi 
resort of taif in october 
aoun has rejected the taif accord because it does not contain a 
specific timetable for the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon 
and he has refused to recognize hrawi as head of state 
geagea who heads the lebanese forces militia has recognized 
hrawis authority and voiced cautious support of the peace plan 
the united states still supports the taif accord and sees it as 
a pressing need that aoun should step down mccarthy told addiyar 
aoun has refused to withdraw from the presidential palace in 
baabda east of beirut hrawi has been forced to set up headquarters 
in moslem west beirut 
i dont mean by stepping down that aoun should leave baabda 
only he also should recognize the legal authority and join the 
national reconciliation march provided by the taif accord 
mccarthy said 
mccarthy and his american staff evacuated the us embassy in 
beiruts northern suburb of aoukar sept 6 after proaoun youths 
besieged the compound protesting alleged american opposition to 
their leader 
mccarthy met hrawi in cairo during an arab tour by the lebanese 
president that also took him to libya and tunisia 
aouns control of about 40 percent of the 310squaremile 
christian enclave has prevented hrawis syrianbacked government 
from spreading its authority to the disputed sector 
mccarthy said continuation of the present situation in lebanon 
would lead to further fragmentation of the nation 
intercommunal clashes and more refugees

for the first time since the ukrainian 
catholic church was banned more than four decades ago its 
clandestine bishops will meet with the pope later this month it was 
announced friday 
pope john paul ii set the meeting for june 2526 to discuss 
efforts to legalize the church and recover its lost property the 
vatican said in a statement 
the 10 ukrainian catholic bishops living in the soviet republic 
will be joined by the 18 ukrainian prelates living in the west said 
romebased ukrainian cardinal myroslav lubachivsky in a separate 
statement 
this will be the first meeting between the pope of the 
universal church and the ukrainian catholic hierarchy from the 
ukraine since the ukrainian church was liquidated in 1946 
lubachivsky said 
the suppression was carried out by dictator josef stalin who 
forced the ukrainian catholics to merge with the russian orthodox 
church bishops and priests who resisted were shot or imprisoned 
according to western estimates there are 4 million to 6 million 
catholics in the ukraine until recently they practiced their faith 
clandestinely but in the past few years many have emerged to worship 
openly and demand official recognition 
the ukrainian issue was one of the topics discussed when soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev met with john paul in december in the 
first visit of a kremlim chief to the vatican 
gorbachev pledged enactment of a law guaranteeing freedom of 
conscience in the officially atheist country which would pave the 
way for legalization of the ukrainian church the bill is slowly 
working its way through the soviet legislature 
since gorbachevs visit the ukrainians have regained many 
churches and the faithful have been registering with authorities 
parish by parish in anticipation of full legality 
lubachivsky said the 10 ukrainian bishops were all consecrated 
clandestinely only in the past two years have some of their names 
been made public 
talks bringing together officials of the vatican the ukrainian 
and the orthodox churches broke down in march when ukrainian leaders 
complained that moscow was dragging its feet on the freedom of 
religion law but the ukrainians have said they are prepared to go 
back to the negotiating table 
the return of church property is a major stumbling block because 
the orthodox stand to lose hundreds of churches they took over after 
1946 
the vatican statement issued by papal spokesman joaquin navarro 
said the vatican hopes the meeting will contribute to the solution 
of still existing difficulties in the ukraine 
it referred to the ukrainian church as a meritorious church 
that has given heroic testimony of its catholic faith in 
particularly difficult circumstances

three moslem militants shot and killed the 
uncle of indias home minister at his home in the disputed kashmir 
valley authorities said today 
ghulam hassan shah an uncle of home minister mufti mohammad 
sayeed was killed thursday night in bijbiara 25 miles southeast of 
srinagar the summer capital of jammukashmir state and a stronghold 
of moslem secessionists 
shah was one of several relatives whom sayeed had evacuated to 
new delhi last winter fearing they would be targeted by moslem 
militants seeking independence for jammukashmir 
shah 62 returned to bijbiara a week ago because of his concern 
for the wellbeing of a son who had stayed behind according to the 
neighbors who spoke on condition of anonymity 
sayeeds daughter rubaiya was kidnapped by moslem separatists 
in srinagar in december and held hostage for six days until the 
government freed five members of the jammukashmir liberation front

a moslem majority about 64 percent of the 6 million inhabitants are 
moslem nationwide moslems make up only 12 percent of indias 880 
million people while hindus account for 82 percent

the seizure of a 4600acre ranch used as 
a landing field by drug traffickers has been reversed by a federal 
appeals court which ordered the property returned to the innocent 
owner 
when marshals moved against the tucker ranch east of lake 
okeechobee in september 1988 us attorney dexter lehtinen hailed 
it as part of the largest drugrelated propety seizure in the nation 
but the tucker family vigorously fought the action saying they 
had no way of knowing their tenant frank brady was using the land 
for illegal purposes on wednesday the seizure was dismissed by the 
11th us circuit court of appeals 
robert t godley a senior vice president for the first union 
national bank of florida the current trustee for the property 
applauded the decision 
its been very tough godley said in our quest to end the 
drug problem in this country laws are being passed and citizens are 
being denied their civil rights we were guilty until proven 
innocent its a bit of anarchy 
no one disputed the ranch was used as an airstrip by brady a 
medellin drug cartel smuggler who was sentenced to 10 years in 
prison in 1986 brady flew marijuana into the country from the 
bahamas at one point he was listed as one of the fbis 10 most 
wanted 
but brady only rented part of the ranch and the tucker family 
which was never implicated in the case said it was unfairly 
penalized 
their attorney edward a marod argued the owners had done 
everything possible to prevent illegal activity on their land short 
of sealing it from the air with barbed wire 
in august 1989 miami us district judge edward davis sided with 
the tuckers the judge ruled he was unwilling to require majority 
shareholders to walk thousands of acres to assure themselves that 
no illegal activity is taking place 
the us attorneys office appealed davis decision last week 
however it reversed its stand and asked for the dismissal 
lehtinens office had no immediate comment on the case 
the dismissal clears the way for a sale arranged more than a year 
ago martin county property records show the land is worth about 
73 million 
federal law enforcement officials defend their practice of 
seizing property used for drug smuggling and called it one of the 
most effective tools in the war on drugs 
if a landowner allows drug smuggling on his property people 
have to just face that the consequences can be devastating said 
paul miller spokesman for the fbi in miami

a state of emergency was declared in eastern 
uzbekistan today because of ethnic warfare over the distribution of 
plots of land and the president of the republic asked the kremlin 
to help settle the conflict 
the soviet news agency tass said five days of clashes between 
ethnic uzbeks and kirghiz in kirghizia have left at least 78 people 
dead and 330 wounded 
on thursday dozens of people in uzbekistan crossed into 
neighboring kirghizia and one person was killed and 33 injured in 
fights a soviet interior ministry spokesman said on condition of 
anonymity 
uzbek president islam karimov declared the state of emergency for 
the region near the kirghiz border and sent an urgent telegram to 
president mikhail s gorbachev warning that the violence could cause 
open conflict between the two republics tass said 
karimov called on the kremlin to dispatch a government 
commission headed by a member of the politburo and including 
deputies of the supreme soviet legislature to assist in ending the 
strife 
a state of emergency already is in effect in the kirghiz border 
city of osh where the fighting broke out on monday and in 
kirghizias capital frunze 
residents of the two densely populated soviet republics have been 
fighting each other in a dispute over the allocation of plots of 
land 
the interior ministry spokesman said more than 3000 kirghiz 
youths in frunze demanded today to be allowed to go to osh 195 
miles south 
tass quoted col felix kulov as saying the situation remained 
tense near osh 
the area is closed to western correspondents and official 
accounts of the unrest and the death toll have been sketchy 
tass said thousands of police and soldiers have been sent into 
the region on thursday interior minister vadim bakatin told 
lawmakers in moscow that 1500 soldiers 900 police and interior 
ministry troops and 450 border guards were in kirghizia in an 
attempt to quell the fighting 
authorities declared the emergency in frunze after cars were 
destroyed and thousands of people surrounded communist party and 
government buildings 
the protesters demanded the resignation of the republics leaders 
within three days and urged kirghiz to unite and strike back at 
uzbeks tass reported 
tass said 249 houses and 40 cars had been burned in the fighting 
and that police had confiscated 79 guns 
the sequence of events in kirghizia has been similar to other 
outbreaks in past months in the heavily populated povertystricken 
region of central asia a local dispute in this case conflicting 
claims by kirghiz and uzbeks to private plots unleashing pentup 
fury between the ethnic groups 
the uzbeks and the kirghiz are predominantly sunni moslem ethnic 
groups that speak different turkic dialects 
abdurakhim pulatov one of the leaders of the uzbek popular 
movement berlik said thursday that refugees were telling 
horrible stories about how kirghiz are destroying the uzbek 
population 
he said berlik and the uzbek government were trying to appeal to 
uzbeks in kirghizia to defuse the crisis but added its hard 
because the people are already in the streets this should have been 
done a week ago

some of the worlds top physicists savored the 
possibility today of making the siberian snake concept and 
shooting subatomic particles underground to arkansas with the 
planned superconducting super collider 
somewhat like selecting options for a new family car members of 
an advisory committee are soliciting project suggestions for the 
atom smasher scheduled to be built south of dallas fourteen groups 
representing more than 1500 scientists began their presentations 
thursday and continued today 
some of the best physicists in the world are obviously eager to 
go said roy f schwitters director of the scc laboratory 
when completed the 53mile particle accelerator is expected to 
confirm many theories about matter and energy while disproving 
others 
murdock gilchriese of the lawrence berkeley laboratory in 
berkeley calif said the competition that opened thursday is 
exciting for those involved because it brings them so much closer to 
the work they believe will reap great discoveries 
its essentially the same reason people climb mountains to 
see whats over the hills gilchriese said 
schwitters said that completion is at least eight years away 
adding that its too soon to say how much the total cost will 
be current estimates are about 8 billion 
the project passed a critical test thursday when a house 
subcommittee in washington unanimously accepted the white houses 
spending recommendation of 318 million for the super collider 
the experimental programs being touted in dallas by 
representatives of the 14 groups not only included recommendations 
for possible experiments but concepts for detectors that can record 
results of experiments 
more than 100 people including many of the worlds leading 
physicists listened as the presentations unfolded thursday the 
proposals will be evaluated by the advisory committee during the 
summer and the fall the committee will make its recommendations 
nov 13 
alan krisch of the university of michigan led off thursday with a 
pitch to include spincorrecting devices in the collider he 
stressed the importance of considering the rotation of the protons 
as they are shot at around the giant ring 
under the proposal from krischs group a series of eight 
halfmeterlong magnets would be placed every 3 kilometers at each 
point the magnets would force protons to flip over 180 degrees 
whatever imperfections there are in the facility would cancel 
each other out explained krisch 
the technique is called the siberian snake concept and one 
of its creators y derbenev of the soviet union will soon be 
conducting research at ann arbor mich alongside krisch 
another group wants 150 million to search for the higgs 
particle which has eluded scientists so far group spokesman dick 
lander said the particles attributes have been predicted by many 
including namesake peter higgs and the super conductor has been 
designed to be large enough to find one 
if it exists it should show up as a particle that decays into 
four other particles its almost guaranteed the way the theory is 
written that well find it he said if we cant find it the 
theory cant survive 
lander said a planned accelerator in europe also was designed to 
be large enough to look for the higgs particle 
its a race for the higgs he said 
michael lieber of the university of arkansas said his group wants 
the committee to consider equipping the super collider with the 
capability of shooting a stream of neutrinos to arkansas 
they would shoot 20 billion billion neutrinos per pulse and we 
would stop about a million of those lieber said of a planned 
neutrino detector 200 meters in diameter it would be placed in a 
lake near hot springs ark 
the experiment would try to determine if and how neutrinos change 
as they travel lieber said scientists ultimately would like to know 
why only about a third of the neutrinos shot earthward from the sun 
actually make it here

prime minister yitzhak shamir today announced 
the formation of a new rightwing government that pledged to 
uproot the palestinian uprising and expand jewish settlements in 
the occupied territories a leading palestinian activist immediately 
criticized the new coalitions policies calling them obstacles in 
the way of peace 
shimon peres leader of the rival leftcenter labor party 
predicted the coalition would be beset by infighting 
todays coalition agreement would give shamir 62 votes in the 
120member knesset where a vote approving the government could come 
as early as monday 
shamirs announcement came after he signed an agreement with a 
string of farright and religious factions plus a defector from the 
labor party 
the formation of the new government the first to be fully 
controlled by shamirs likud bloc since 1984 breaks a 3monthold 
political deadlock 
close election results since 1984 had forced likud and labor into 
powersharing arrangements but ideological differences often 
paralyzed political action 
a likudlabor unity government fell apart march 15 in 
disagreements between the two parties over whether to take part in 
usproposed peace talks with palestinians 
after the governments collapse peres failed in a 35day effort 
to form a leftleaning government 
as legally required shamir telephoned president chaim herzog to 
report the formation of the new coaltion 
the announcement came only hours before his 42day mandate for 
forming a government ran out at sundown with the beginning of the 
jewish sabbath 
the new governments expected hard line on the 30monthold 
palestinian uprising and its plans to push for more settlements of 
jews in the occupied lands were likely to exacerbate tensions with 
the united states 
washington has been urging israel to make concessions to 
palestinians to revive the stalled peace process 
on the uprising the coalition pledged to to uproot the 
phenomenon of violence and disturbances and create tranquility in 
all parts of israel 
faisal husseini a leading proplo activist in the occupied 
lands said after the announcement we believe the next few months 
will be hard ones 
there will be more obstacles in the way of peace he said 
the new coalitions policy guidelines oppose the formation of a 
palestinian state and renew israels refusal to talk with the 
palestine liberation organization 
they insist on the right of jews to settle in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip saying the government will act to strengthen 
expand and develop the settlements 
arab countries have claimed that israel will settle many of the 
thousands of soviet jewish immigrants in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
ariel sharon a leading rightwing figure was reported to be in 
line to become housing minister and thus would be in charge of the 
settling of soviet immigrants after the announcement sharon was 
asked about settling soviets in the territories 
israel is a democratic country everyone can settle where he 
wants he replied 
peres said on israel radio that opposing views of the many 
coalition partners were likely to split the new government 
most of the time and energy will be spent in holding it 
together instead of advancing the state he said 
the delicate coalition bargaining involved a number of small 
parties each with different views the lengthy bickering raised 
demands for political reform to end the system under which tiny 
parties hold the balance of power 
shamir asked if cabinet posts had been assigned replied not 
yet 
but reports said likud hardliners would be in charge at the key 
ministries israel army radio said housing minister david levy would 
become foreign minister and the present foreign minister moshe 
arens would be defense minister 
besides likud the coalition partners include three rightwing 
parties three religious ones two oneman factions and lawmaker 
ephraim gur who quit the labor party on thursday 
news reports had suggested shamir would have preferred a 
coalition with labor but he said on army radio he did not expect 
the rival party to join the new government now 
at this stage it is not realistic he said 
in the last election in november 1988 likud won 40 seats and 
labor 39 forcing them into a socalled national unity government 
shamir alluded to that failed government as he announced the 
formation of the new coalition 
i pray that national unity will exist in this government that 
we are forming today and that all of us will act together for 
the israeli people and the land of israel he said 
radio reports said the governments guidelines include various 
promises to meet demands of the small partners 
one promise intended to satisfy ultraorthodox parties says the 
government will press to outlaw the sale of pork in israel in line 
with jewish dietary strictures

us secretary of state james a baker 
iii today said washington is seeking more information on a foiled 
palestinian raid along the israeli coast before deciding whether to 
cut off talks with the plo 
last weeks attempted raid has to be taken very seriously 
baker said but he added that some perspective and responsibility 
is required in dealing with the issue 
baker responding to reports that a cutoff in talks was imminent 
told reporters the talks are continuing while the administration 
seeks to find out all we need to know about the circumstances 
he declined to say what information was still lacking 
baker made his comments during a news conference at the 
conclusion of a twoday nato foreign ministers meeting in turnberry 
israel and some us lawmakers have demanded that the bush 
administration break off the 16monthold direct contacts with the 
palestine liberation organization because its chairman yasser 
arafat has refused to condemn the attempted raid by a plo faction 
on may 30 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd in a separate news 
conference said a break in the dialogue would be a real setback 
to peace efforts in the middle east i am very keen that he 
baker and the us administration should remain directly engaged 
that is crucially important 
but hurd also urged arafat to be more precise and specific in 
condemning the attempted raid 
israeli forces foiled the raid on the beaches of tel aviv and the 
palestine liberation front a wing of the plo claimed 
responsibility 
the attack followed the slaying 10 days earlier of seven 
palestinian laborers by an israeli the government described as 
deranged 
since then the bush administration has weighed whether to 
suspend the talks with the plo that in december 1988 after arafat 
renounced terrorism

nelson mandela said today that south africa will 
one day need massive western financial aid to help its people but 
that economic sanctions should be maintained until the white 
government scraps apartheid 
the black nationalist leader who underwent surgery last week to 
have a benign cyst removed canceled a morning meeting with red 
cross officials due to fatigue a red cross spokeswoman said 
however mandela who turns 72 next month spoke later to the 
international labor organization 
given the fact that apartheid has not ended it is only logical 
that we should continue this weapon of struggle mandela deputy 
president of the african national congress told the annual meeting 
of the 150nation un body 
in the future he said the south africa economy will need 
massive international intervention if we are to move forward at a 
pace that recognized the urgency of the needs of our people 
mandela freed in february after 27 years in prison concluded 
his speech by talking of a glorious vision of south africa free of 
racism no longer the skunk of the world 
mandela says other countries should not lift their restrictions 
on trade and investment to south africa despite an announcement 
thursday by south african president fw de klerk to drop repressive 
state of emergency measures in three of the nations four provinces 
the apartheid system still deprives the nations 28 million 
blacks of a say in the government while the 5 million whites 
control the economy and maintain separate services 
mandela received a thunderous ovation from more than 2000 
delegates crowding the assembly hall of the united nations 
headquarters in geneva the international labor organization 
expelled south africa 25 years ago because of its racial policies 
the organization sets international standards for working 
conditions but the standards are nonbinding and must be ratified 
by individual governments 
mandela canceled a morning visit to the international committee 
of the red cross because of fatigue a red cross spokeswoman 
said 
catherine pelissier said mandela had been due to hold private 
talks with red cross chief cornelio sommaruga 
however mandela kept a lunch appointment at the international 
labor organization and was expected to address the world council of 
churches later 
mandela is on a sixweek trip to europe and north america he 
will stay in switzerland throughout the weekend before continuing to

president mikhail s gorbachev said today that nato 
and the warsaw pact alliances should be cooperating with each other 
in the same way that european leaders from both blocs have been in 
close contact 
if the leaders of the governments cooperate on the political 
level these organizations cant stand aside from their 
governments he said at a joint news conference with visiting 
british prime minister margaret thatcher 
mrs thatcher said she did not think the time was right for a 
system of alleuropean security a plan that would end the division 
of europe into competing military alliances 
gorbachev said he differed with mrs thatcher on this poit 
one can have the policy that will resemble an elephant in a 
china store one move to the left smashes half of the store a move 
to the right smashes the other half he said if this is the 
policy we choose i dont envy us 
both alliances were created to provide security he said 
in the period of the cold war they reached this using one 
method the soviet leader said in the period of the 
construction of the common european home they should use other 
methods 
earlier aides to mrs thatcher said that after her consultations 
with gorbachev she felt increasingly confident that the eastwest 
standoff over germany would be resolved without ultimatums or 
deadlines 
the leaders discussed a ninepoint us proposal aimed at easing 
soviet concerns about a united germany belonging to the nato 
alliance said british officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
the plan would allow soviet troops to remain temporarily in what 
is now east germany and keep western forces out 
the prime minister felt encouraged the british official 
said the whole issue of eastwest relations is evolving 
people have not adopted fixed positions 
as he greeted mrs thatcher in his office at the kremlin 
gorbachev said he still felt jetlagged from his us visit 
yesterday i almost fell asleep during the warsaw treaty 
meeting he joked referring to a summit meeting in moscow of the 
now dying warsaw pact the military alliance of the soviet union and 
its former communist allies 
but thatcher aides said that during the 2hour private talks 
before lunch gorbachev showed no sign of weariness or despondency 
over his mounting domestic problems 
he was cheerful ebullient and confident throughout said a 
british official speaking on condition of anonymity 
mrs thatcher arrived thursday at the start of a fourday visit 
she was to hold separate talks later today with soviet prime 
minister nikolai i ryzhkov and defense minister dmitry t yazov 
she and gorbachev met as both the warsaw pact and the north 
atlantic treaty organization wrestled with the need to find new 
roles 
at a meeting in moscow thursday the sevennation warsaw pact 
said it needed to transform itself into a political body and sought 
constructive cooperation with the 16member western alliance 
nato foreign miisters met thursday and today in scotland also 
trying to work out new stances before a special summit meeting in 
london in july 
both the east and west blocs are seeking to increase the role of 
the 35nation conference on security and cooperation in europe as a 
new paneuropean forum it comprises all the countries of europe 
except albania as well as the united states and canada 
mrs thatcher leaves moscow saturday to visit a british trade and 
cultural exhibition in the ukraine capital kiev on sunday she goes

260000 gallons of heavy oil 
authorities charged the first mate of the 811foot tanker bt 
nautilus with operating a vessel under the influence of alcohol or 
drugs 
the kill van kull and the arthur kill a second shipping channel 
between new jersey and new york have had four major oil spills this 
year 
the coast guard said the quick deployment of absorbent boom 
shortly after the accident at 515 am thursday contained nearly 
all of the no 6 heating oil in the normally busy channel which 
remained closed indefinitely 
about 300 workers including 50 sailors and six vessels from the 
coast guard resumed cleanup operations this morning five skimmer 
boats cruised the channel collecting oil and a special coast guard 
strike team brought in 10 small boats for maneuvering in small coves 
footballsized blobs were found as far away as the 
verrazanonarrows bridge about three nautical miles from the spot 
where the tanker struck bottom as it was docking said coast guard 
lt cmdr paul a milligan 
oil leaked for about five hours from one of the tankers 10 
12milliongallon holds the coast guard said divers found a gash 
about 30 feet long and 12 to 16 inches wide in the ships no 4 
tank but the coast guard had not determined the cause of the 
rupture late thursday night 
new jersey gov jim florio called the spill inexcusable 
saying it indicates that something is dramatically wrong with the 
way the petrochemical industry does business 
the first mate gregory frederick geoffrey 52 of merkse 
england was released on 50000 bail from police custody in bayonne 
thursday night he pleaded innocent to state charges of operating a 
vessel under the influence of alcohol or drugs and negligent 
discharge of a pollutant without a permit 
urine tests were conducted for the ships captain identified by 
the coast guard today as albert ainscough and the harbor pilot 
brought aboard for docking coast guard officials had no further 
information about the crew 
christopher florentz a spokesman for attorney general robert j 
del tufo could not say if gregory used drugs or alcohol or what 
led to his arrest about 4 pm thursday 
i believe he was the spotter so he was up front florentz 
said but geoffreys lawyer richard fx regan said the first 
mates responsibility during docking was to remain on the 
forecastle not to act as spotter 
it appears that my client is really a scapegoat for what 
appears to be an accident regan said 
the coast guard said the cleanup team included guardsmen from 
mobile ala who were deployed on skimmer boats and vacuum truckers 
to shovel rake and sop up the oil about 27000 feet of floating 
booms were already on the water 
coast guard rear adm richard rybacki said the tanker owner 
nautilus motor tanker of gibraltar has assumed responsibility for 
the cleanup the tanker is operated by bulk tanker management of 
london and registered in hong kong

a judges obscenity ruling against a 2 live crew rap 
album has no legal effect outside south florida where a record 
store owner was arrested today but civil libertarians see a 
practical effect spreading nationally 
this does pose a real threat that the amount of obscenity 
actions may increase around the country new york attorney floyd 
abrams a first amendment expert said thursday it is a direct 
threat to freedom of expression in the arts as well as in music in 
particular 
us district judge jose gonzalez ruled wednesday that the lyrics 
of the miami groups sexually explicit album as nasty as they want 
to be are obscene leaving area retailers liable for arrest for 
sales of the platinumselling record 
today a fort lauderdale area record store owner was arrested on 
an obscenity charge after selling the album broward county 
sheriffs deputies arrested ec records owner charles freeman at his 
store less than three hours after he received a shipment of 25 
copies 
america is free free for everybody freeman said and as 
long as this is america and im not living in cuba i feel my rights 
are violated 
an undercover officer went in to buy copies of the record and 
tape then uniformed officers entered the store to make the arrest 
i would have to say that the research and the consultation that 
we were doing has apparently been concluded and were prepared to 
enforce it sheriffs spokesman jim leljedal said minutes after 
the arrest 
before authorities arrived freeman said he had sold all but six 
copies of the recording he said a line had formed outside the shop 
in anticipation of the shipments arrival 
ill go to jail and ill come back and sell it again he 
said before deputies arrived i opened up a record store three 
years ago expecting to sell records and this was the furthest thing 
from my mind 
asked why he would challenge the ban freeman explained im a 
small independent all my money is going to be made on rampb and rap 
so itll hurt me in the long run 
the recording industry generally favors warning stickers on album 
covers to bring attention to lyrics that some might consider 
objectionable 
but michael greene president of the national academy of 
recording arts and sciences said he hoped the specter of censorship 
raised by the fort lauderdale ruling would act as a unifying force 
this ruling alongside the chilling lyrics legislation which is 
making the rounds through the statehouses nationwide must serve as 
a call to mobilize all who value basic artistic freedom and who are 
willing to tenaciously fight for the protection of first amendment 
rights greene said 
bruce jesse vice president of advertising and sales promotion 
for the 265store wherehouse record store chain based in los 
angeles concluded youre putting the retailer at a significant 
risk 
but bruce fein former counsel general of the federal 
communications commission saw a limited impact saying i dont 
think this sets a nationwide precedent that will cause all offcolor 
rock music to be banned 
supplies of 2 live crews disputed record dried up in south 
florida as the obscenity case was argued but the decision is widely 
expected to boost sales elsewhere 
the lesson of history has always been if you tell people you 
cant have anything they want it all the more said nova 
university law professor bruce rogow he represented 2 live crew in 
its lawsuit against broward county sheriff nick navarro over his 
threat to prosecute retailers 
the decision had no effect on the groups plans for two shows 
saturday night at club futura in nearby hollywood 
club owner kenneth gerringer told city council members thursday 
that the opening show would be a tame performance for all age 
groups and he would ask the rappers to shun explicit lyrics in the 
later adultsonly show 
ten uniformed police officers will be working inside and outside 
the club primarily for crowd control said paul dungan 
administrative assistant to the police chief who was out of town 
were handling this as if michael jackson were coming to town 
or dean martin or any of the top stars he said i would not 
advise officers to go up on the stage and arrest four people in 
front of 1000 people 
but mayor sal oliveri gave gerringer a stern warning to pass 
along to 2 live crew saying artist or no artist i dont want 
hollywood to have the reputation in my opinion that we have 
obscene entertainment

president bush said today that despite 
improving relations between the united states and soviet union we 
cannot lose sight of the differences that remain between our two 
countries 
he heralded the beginning of the end of the cold war in the 
wake of his summit meeting last week with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev 
but one problem that will not be solved quickly or easily is 
the future of a unified germany bush said before heading home from 
a midwest swing to consult in washington with west german chancellor 
helmut kohl 
the question of a unified germany is not one that will be 
solved by the united states alone bush told a fundraising 
breakfast for republican gov terry branstad 
in the final analysis its a question for the people of 
germany to decide but the united states remains committed to german 
membership in nato bush said 
the soviet union is opposed to having a unified germany in nato 
bush also renewed his call for the soviets to establish peaceful 
dialog with lithuanian leaders to resolve the tumult in that baltic 
republic 
bush touted the fiveyearcognized people whose homes he had stayed 
in during early 
campaign trips 
on friday the president returned as a major drawing card for gop 
candidates mary matalin republican national committee chief of 
staff said bushs current political speaking trip is raising 
millions for gop candidates 
his visits are following a usual formula he speaks at a 
breakfast lunch or dinner that usually costs up to 1000 per 
ticket then for amounts ranging from 2000 to 5000 apiece 
depending on the locale and the race supporters can meet the 
president at a private reception and have a picture taken 
matalin said bush will take time out from campaigning in july 
because of the nato summit in london and the economic summit in 
houston and will vacation in kennebunkport maine for much of 
august but he will be campaigning nearly nonstop in september and 
october 
bush himself a former rnc chairman has even suggested trips 
himself that party officials havent recommended matalin said 
for instance she told reporters bush wanted to do a fundraising 
stop on thursday in milwaukee for gov tommy thompson even though 
thompson is far ahead in the polls and rnc officials felt he didnt 
need the help 
on most political stops bush also appears at a presidential 
event so that part of the cost of the visit can be defrayed by tax 
dollars 
thus in addition to his stop here to speak for branstad bush 
spoke with iowa pork producers on ongoing trade talks in geneva he 
was combining a stop in omaha neb later friday for gop senate 
candidate hal daub with a discussion with a community antidrug 
group 
bush spoke on thursday at fundraisers for thompsons reelection 
effort in milwaukee and for illinois gop gubernatorial candidate jim 
edgar in chicago

a city alderman is creating a stir with 
his proposal that the city council stop reciting the pledge of 
allegiance regularly 
routine recitation of the pledge of allegiance in a situation 
having no direct relationship to the entity to which the allegiance 
is being pledged tends to trivialize the flag alderman les 
nelsons resolution says 
nelson said council meetings have only a mimimal relationship 
to the federal government he added that the pledge would be more 
meaningful if it was recited only on special occasions such as 
veterans day or flag day 
the council is scheduled to consider the resolution tuesday 
night alan colvin another member of the council called it a a 
wacky idea 
the pledge of allegiance to the flag is symbolic to patriotism 
i think its important for us to do these kind of things especially 
as elected officials patriotism and americanism are hot issues 
these days this will attract a lot of attention he said

she studies for a job that may not exist 
lives on an allowance that seems to buy less and comes from a city 
where the main industry is expected to die 
beatrice uhlig sat in front of east germanys parliament at 
midnight thursday one of a few hundred college students sprawled on 
the steps of the big building their banners crumpled beside them 
earlier in the day thousands staged a sitin at the parliaments 
main entrance to demand increases in their living allowances which 
they say are not keeping pace with rising prices 
at 8 am beatrice uhlig was calling for a higher stipend to 
stay in college at midnight as the students protest wore on she 
was contemplating life after school 
do i have hope not much said the 23yearold dairy science 
student at east berlins humboldt university but i am young 
there is always a future 
east germany is to officially become a free market july 2 when 
it merges its economy with west germanys in a major step to german 
unification 
the day that germans call day x is still five weeks away but 
the effects have already begun 
joblessness has started to rise farmers are sitting on stocks of 
unsold meat and vegetables which are being shunned by east german 
consumers who prefer betterquality western goods 
several industries are facing canceled orders from distributors 
who are keeping their warehouses open for the influx of westernmade 
products they would rather sell 
east german lawmakers held a heated debate thursday over whether 
to force retailers and distributors to sell goods grown or made by 
east german industries 
they finally decided not to tamper with the embryonic free 
market voting instead to allow farms and industries to bypass 
wholesalers completely and try to sell their goods directly to 
retail stores 
this was a mere stopgap measure to miss uhlig who has little 
hope for the future of her field 
she is an agriculture student specializing in dairy production a 
highly specialized area that is geared to work on a communist farm 
collective 
the huge collectives are run as overstaffed factories with 
workers trained for specific jobs the system is inefficient 
compared to marketoriented western farms where cows are milked by 
regular workers not collegetrained dairy engineers 
i am not sure if there is much hope for my type of job she 
said 
miss uhligs hometown is the southern industrial town of zwickau 
which produces the east german trabant auto a tiny lowtech 
twocylinder car that is disappearing fast from east german streets 
my sisters husband works there but i dont know for how 
long she said 
economics minister gerhard pohl told parliament on thursday that 
the government will discuss the possibility of closing large 
sections of industries to conduct massive retraining programs 
he said this discussion would take place against the backdrop of 
the hopeless situation in many industries including the auto 
industry 
the stipend miss uhlig receives while attending school is 200 
marks a month right now the equivalent of 100 west german marks or 
60 
the students who protested thursday demanded 500 marks 
we need it she said prices are high prices are high 
because east germans are buying west german products 
miss uhlig said she feels pessimistic because so much of east 
germanys transition to a new society is a mystery 
both german governments believe an initial stage of economic 
hardship will dissipate as western investment moves in creating new 
jobs and raising living standards 
i hope it happens said miss uhlig

nato foreign ministers today welcomed 
plans by the rival warsaw pact to study ways of transforming itself 
from a military alliance into a political organization 
president mikhail s gorbachev said in moscow that nato and the 
warsaw pact should be cooperating in the same way as european 
leaders from both blocs and that he might support one security 
system for all of europe 
the ministers of the north atlantic treaty organization said they 
were encouraged by the positive spirit shown by a summit of 
warsaw pact leaders in moscow on thursday 
in a final statement concluding their own twoday meeting the 
nato ministers said they were ready to contribute actively to 
building confidence and closer relations between all european 
countries including the members of the two alliances 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner went out of his way to 
extend the hand of friendship and cooperation to the soviet 
union and others in the warsaw pact 
he said nato wanted to end soviet isolation from the rest of 
europe 
the soviet union would gain stability he said it would 
gain partners even friends what a gain for the soviet union what 
a gain for the whole of europe 
us secretary of state james a baker iii said the western 
allies were themselves forming a new alliance renewed and 
reinvigorated to develop and ensure a europe whole and freed 
nato officials have been taking a hard look at their own alliance 
and its strategy in an era of reduced eastwest tensions 
on thursday leaders of the seven warsaw pact nations ended their 
summit by declaring that their military alliance long dominated by 
the soviet union must be transformed to reflect the changes in 
europe the summit said it would study ways to bring that 
transformation about 
a senior us official said today he saw the warsaw pact summit 
as a triumph for gorbachev in that he managed to keep hungary and 
czechoslovakia in the alliance for now 
the fact that the warsaw pact was able to do this may make the 
soviet union a little calmer about the impending unification of 
germany said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the warsaw pact has nearly collapsed since the soviet unions 
allies began ousting their longruling communist regimes last year 
gorbachev said today it was time for greater closeness between 
the alliances because of the changing politics in europe 
if the leaders of the governments cooperate on the political 
level these organizations cant stand aside from their 
governments he said at a joint news conference with visiting 
british prime minister margaret thatcher 
mrs thatcher said she did not think the time was right for a 
system of alleuropean security which would end the division of 
europe into competing military alliances 
but gorbachev said he disagreed 
one can have the policy that will resemble an elephant in a 
china store one move to the left smashes half of the store a move 
to the right smashes the other half he said if this is the 
policy we choose i dont envy us 
if nato shows the same willingness as the warsaw pact to 
transform itself this will open the possibilities for some 
agreement in favor of an alleuropean system of security 
gorbachev said 
the nato communique also stressed that the ministers attach the 
highest priority to the conclusion this year of a treaty to cut 
us and soviet troops and nonnuclear weapons in europe 
the allies said they were prepared to make reasonable 
compromises to finish the treaty they said they told their 
negotiators in vienna to pursue new approaches particularly on 
aircraft armor and verification measures 
the soviets have been objecting to the inclusion of hundreds of 
planes that the western allies categorize as combat weapons moscow 
argues that their mission is purely defensive 
the ministers reiterated their demand that a united germany be a 
member of nato we believe that european stability as well as the 
wishes of the german people requires that a unified germany be a 
full member of this alliance they said 
they also said the west sought no unilateral advantage from 
german unity and was prepared to demonstrate this taking into 
account legitimate soviet security interests 
president bush said today he did not believe the future of a 
unified germany would be solved quickly or easily 
in the final analysis its a question for the people of 
germany to decide bush said at a republican fundraising 
breakfast in des moines iowa mrs margaret thatcher felt more 
confident after meeting today with gorbachev that the standoff would 
be resolved a spokesman said 
gorbachev has opposed nato membership for a united germany the 
soviets have suggested that the new german state either be neutral 
or belong to the warsaw pact 
the nato ministers also endorsed a ninepoint list of assurances 
drawn up by the united states to gain moscows support of nato 
membership for the new germany 
the list includes promises to allow soviet troops to remain 
temporarily in what is now east germany and to keep western forces 
off that territory

former president jose figueres who 
led costa rica through a revolution and into 41 years of continuous 
peace died today officials said he was 83 
figueres died at home in san jose presidential spokesman ana 
lorena vargas said the cause of his of death was not known 
the useducated figueres was elected president three times he 
abolished the army in 1949 a civil guard remains the nations sole 
line of defense in this island of tranquility surrounded by 
neighbors in turmoil 
affectionately known as don pepe figueres was a 
contradictory figure he boasted of having worked closely with the 
cia in his earlier days but he raged against us policy against 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government which ruled until it was 
ousted earlier this year in free elections 
born in 1906 of catalonian immigrants in costa rica figueres 
entered politics and by the 1940s had developed a strong following 
in 1948 after allegedly fraudulent elections figueres took to 
the hills with a band of rebels and led a brief but bloody 
revolution that overthrew president fernando calderon guardia who 
had allied himself with the communist party 
after taking over as president of a provisional junta for a year 
figueres banned the communists oversaw the writing of a new 
constitution that provided increased social services and most 
importantly banned the army the only latin american leader in 
history to do so 
this small country made a contribution to mankind by outlawing 
the army he said but we had to pay dearly we killed 2000 
communists 
figueres had a second term from 1953 to 1958 and a third from 
1970 to 1974 he was an accessible president often seen on the 
streets of san jose 
his short graying figure remained for years a familiar sight at 
gatherings of almost any class in costa rica always traveling alone 
without bodyguards 
he lived his last years in a simple aframe house on a farm in 
the hills 10 miles east of san jose 
while anticommunism had been a trademark of his earlier years 
figueres grew to tolerate and even embrace the left he was an 
adviser to the sandinistas before and after they ousted dictator 
anastasio somoza in 1979 
he saw us backing for antisandinista rebels as flawed 
however he said us policy was succeeding in el salvador where 
he visited as an observer during elections in 1984 
figueres studied electrical engineering at the massachusetts 
institute of technology in cambridge mass from 1934 to 1938 but 
never pursued engineering he married henrietta boggs of alabama in 
1942 and they had two children before the marriage ended in 1952 
he then married karen olsen a naturalized american citizen of 
danish birth they had three children and were divorced in 1980

nato officials ended a twoday meeting 
friday saying they want an eastwest accord this year on arms and 
troop cuts in europe and are willing to compromise further to get 
one 
the negotiations in vienna have slowed down over proposed cuts in 
warplanes and over soviet reservations about a unified germany 
belonging to the north atlantic treaty organization 
but secretary of state james a baker iii and allied foreign 
ministers who met in this scottish seacoast town concluded the 
soviets were lowering their objections 
the soviets have opposed natos efforts in the vienna 
negotiations to restrict aircraft that moscow considers defensive 
as a result the warsaw pact has not responded to the latest nato 
proposal which sets a ceiling of 195000 on us and soviet troops 
in central europe and imposes limits on tanks aircraft artillery 
armored personnel carriers helicopters and other nonnuclear arms 
we strongly emphasize that we attach the highest priority to 
the conclusion this year of a cfe conventional forces in europe 
treaty the nato communique said 
the allies pledged to explore all open issues on the basis of a 
willingness on all sides to make reasonable compromises 
we have therefore instructed our negotiators in vienna to 
pursue new approaches to mutually acceptable solutions in 
particular on aircraft armor and verification the nato 
ministers said 
baker at a news conference said soviet foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze indicated to him tuesday in copenhagen denmark 
that they would have new proposals 
other us officials said they might be put on the table in 
vienna in the next few days 
baker has offered shevardnadze a ninepoint western package of 
guarantees including that nato troops would not move into what is 
now east germany after the german states are united 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher insisted the 
final communique reiterate past west german statements pledging the 
territory would be offlimits to nato troops 
that apparent rift aside baker nato secretarygeneral manfred 
woerner and foreign ministers of the western alliance emphasized 
they wanted to allay soviet concerns about having a more powerful 
neighbor 
we extend to the soviet union and all other european countries 
the hand of friendship and cooperation woerner said 
the nato statement also welcomed plans by the longtime rival 
warsaw pact to undertake a drastic political overhaul 
the allies said they were encouraged by the positive spirit 
shown by at the summit meeting held by the soviet union with leaders 
of bulgaria czechoslovakia east germany hungary poland and 
romania in moscow on thursday and especially pleased by the 
readiness on the part of the countries for constructive 
cooperation 
woerner said we want to build bridges to the warsaw pact and 
end what he described as soviet isolation from the rest of europe 
at the same time woerner did not try to woo the members into the

senate republicans are stalling democratic 
efforts to slap president bush with his first veto override after 
the house voted to set aside presidential rejection of an amtrak 
funding bill 
senate minority leader bob dole of kansas said the vote was too 
important to the president for a vote thursday or today with several 
republicans absent none of bushs 10 vetoes last year was 
overturned and the amtrak bill prompted his first veto of 1990 
bush told reporters today i think its going to be very 
close in the senate he said he hoped congress would sustain his 
veto 
bush has said he supports the bills authorization of 2 billion 
for amtrak over the next three years but vetoed the measure because 
of a provision that increases government control over freight 
railroad buy outs 
democrats accused the administration of trying to scuttle support 
for the successful national passenger rail service a course 
followed unsuccessfully by the reagan administration 
the administration has again showed its opposition to the 
funding for amtrak said sen james exon dneb 
as republican senators tried to round up votes to protect 
presidential prestige house gop leaders introduced an alternative 
measure that supports amtrak but leaves out increased interstate 
commerce commission authority over rail takeover attempts 
the icc already has the power to scrutinize takeovers involving 
multiple railroads or a portion of a railroad the bill would give 
it authority over the buy out of a whole railroad by nonrail 
interests 
bush in his veto message called the provision a step backward 
for the entire rail industry he said it would interfere with the 
ability of railroads to obtain financing and be a step towards 
reregulation of the industry 
democrats argued that government scrutiny is needed to prevent 
corporate raiders from ruining the nations railroads with leverage 
buy outs 
the president is committed to an adequate passenger rail 
service said house gop leader bob michel of illinois he said 
bush would not veto the measure if it is passed again without the 
icc provision 
the vetoed bill also contained provisions needed to start a 
commuter rail service into virginia suburbs near washington to save 
amtrak 16 million over two years in unemployment insurance for rail 
workers and to allow truck bus and rail workers to file state 
income tax in only one state even though they may work in several 
exon opened debate on the override in the senate and tried to 
push for a quick vote but republicans first failed to field any 
response and then dole announced hed prevent a vote 
the trains are going to run whether we do this today next 
wednesday or a week from wednesday dole said 
the veto has not affected amtrak operations because the railroad 
is working with money that congress already has appropriated the 
bill envisions more than 2 billion going to the line through sept 
30 1992 actual amounts will be determined when congress 
appropriates the money 
democrats are expected to push for a vote on the override again 
next week 
the amtrak authorization passed the house 32293 and got 
unanimous support in the senate but the icc provision was added 
during negotiations between the two houses that produced the final 
bill 
several republicans indicated opposition to the amtrak aid as 
well as the leverage buyout provision

although he has been music director of the 
new york philharmonic since 1978 zubin mehta has not conducted an 
entire opera in new york in 19 years 
but that hasnt stopped him from conducting opera elsewhere and 
on thursday he led luciano pavarotti in the opening night of a new 
production of verdis il trovatore at the maggio musicale 
fiorentina florences spring music festival 
mehta the longesttenured music director in new york 
philharmonic history often has been accused of uninspired 
performances in new york part of the problem is the 
fourconcertaweek routine and the notoriously bad acoustics in 
avery fisher hall 
on thursday night at the teatro comunale his conducting was 
propulsive and exciting at times he revved up the orchestra in a 
manner similar to that of sir georg solti the chicago symphony 
music director who long has been the champion of boisterous 
conducting 
mehta actually began his opera career in this artfilled city on 
the arno river debuting with verdis la traviata in 1964 he 
has not conducted opera anywhere in the united states since leading 
wagners tristan und isolde at los angeles 2 years ago his 
last new york opera performance was a trovatore at the 
metropolitan opera on march 20 1971 
since mehta also is muic director of the maggio musicale he was 
able to put together a steller cast for thursdays performance 
pavarotti also sang manrico in the 4000seat metropolitan opera 
house two years ago in an auditorium half that size he was much 
more convincing his tenor filling the hall without strain 
dolora zajick a slavic soprano sang azucena a role she also 
performed with pavarotti at the met 
while dame joan sutherland and eva marton sang leonora at the 
met the young soprano antonella banaudi sang it on thursday night 
a replacement for susan dunn giorgio zancanero was the count di 
luna manricos rival for leonoras affections 
the production the first new trovatore in florence since 
1977 was done by giuliano montaldo a film director nana cecchi 
designed outstanding period costumes and the sets by luciano ricceri 
were handsome and unusually realistic the opposite of the ugly 
black marble steps that dominate fabrizio melanos met production 
in sharp contrast to the way things are in new york mehta was 
the star of the show getting the loudest ovation of the night from 
the glamorous florentine audience

the inventor of a device a 54yearold woman used 
this week to commit asked a circuit judge today allow him to form a 
committee to establish an international planned death policy 
dr jack kevorkian told judge alice gilbert he wanted to form a 
committee with members from all sectors of society that would study 
his device which involves injection of coma and deathinducing 
drugs and the circumstances under which it could be used 
the panel would establish a policy for the world for use of 
his invention kevorkian said promising he would refrain from using 
it again until the committee completed its work 
gilbert recessed the hearing in pontiac until this afternoon 
without ruling 
oakland county prosecutor richard thompson took kevorkian to 
court seeking an injunction barring further use of the device that 
killed janet adkins of portland ore 
although michigan has no law against assisting suicide thompson 
has said authorities are investigating the possibility of charges 
against the doctor and they dont want the device used again 
adkins killed herself monday after kevorkian hooked her to the 
machine and she pressed a button to release the lethal chemicals 
fewer than half of the states have outlawed helping someone 
commit suicide but law professors say the legality of such 
assistance is open to interpretation 
meanwhile a survey in usa today found that twothirds of people 
say the terminally ill should be allowed to end their lives and 
medical facilities should be available to help them do it 
the phone poll of 724 adults with a sampling error of 35 
percent also found 28 percent feel kevorkian should be prosecuted 
and 43 percent said he shouldnt be punished 
although authorities failed to subpoena kevorkian at his royal 
oak home thursday they did serve papers to his sisters margo janus 
of troy and flora holzheimer of frankfurt west germany they 
allegedly were present in the oakland county park where adkins died 
in the back of kevorkians 1968 volkswagen van 
assisting a suicide is a crime in 23 states and three us 
territories said robert brown professor and director of the health 
law center at the university of detroit law school 
in those jurisdictions assisting suicide is classified as a 
unique offense manslaughter or murder brown said 
states and territories with laws against aiding suicide include 
arizona california connecticut delaware florida guam hawaii 
kansas maine minnesota mississippi montana nebraska new 
hampshire new jersey new mexico new york oregon oklahoma 
pennsylvania puerto rico south dakota texas washington 
wisconsin and the virgin islands 
i think its unlikely that michigan is going to become the 
suicide haven of north america brown said there may be an 
aiding and abetting statute in which a prosecutor may squeeze these 
facts in 
suicide is legal in michigan but professor yale kamisar of the 
university of michigan law school said the legality of assisting a 
suicide is open to debate 
in 1920 the michigan supreme court ruled that a man who had put 
poison within the reach of his deathly ill wife was guilty of 
firstdegree murder when she committed suicide kamisar said 
but in 1983 the state court of appeals said a man shouldnt be 
charged with murder because he had given a friend a gun that the 
friend later used to commit suicide 
the high court didnt review the 1983 appeal so we have this 
intermediate court causing all this confusion kamisar said

when the going gets 
tough even the toughest pardners on the wyoming centennial wagon 
train can get going straight to the whining tent 
all in all folks have been pretty happy on the monthlong 
260mile trek wagon train spokesman bj wertz said but this being 
the enlightened 90s 1990s that is certain precautions must be 
taken 
if someone starts complaining we send them to the whining 
tent wertz said that pretty much lightens people up 
so far the only things people have had to whine about have been 
some fairly stiff winds on thursday some bad hay and a couple of 
minor accidents 
more than 70 wagons and nearly 1000 people from across the 
united states are participating in the trip from casper to cody 
which is being made to celebrate wyomings centennial on thursday 
they campd at arminto about 50 miles west of casper 
in one of the most frightening mishaps so far a 13yearold girl 
was thrown from her horse thursday and flown by helicopter to the 
wyoming medical center where she was treated and released the 
girl whose identity was not made public will be rejoining the 
wagon train wertz said 
other minor incidents like a sheep wagon coming loose from its 
hitch and sliding into a barrow pit or broken wagon wheels and 
hitch tongues have pulled the train together wertz said 
its just like if youre driving along the highway and you 
break down only someone will stop and help you she said 
pulling together on the trail has also made for fun evenings in 
camp 
every night theres been guitar playing and storytelling she 
said theres a squeeze box accordion in camp and theres lots of 
music and dancing its real spontaneous fun theres even cowboy

president bush said today he is 
considering breaking off talks with the palestine liberation 
organization in the wake of a terrorist attack on an israeli beach 
but no decision has been made 
bush speaking with reporters on a midwestern political trip was 
asked about a report in the washington times that the administration 
has decided to break off its 16month dialogue with the plo 
im not prepared to make an announcement on policy at this 
point bush said however he said our dialogue is predicated 
on a renunciation of terror in my view this is sheer terror 
speaking separately at a nato conference secretary of state 
james a baker iii said the administration is seeking more 
information on the raid 
he said a decision on the usplo talks would be made when we 
are satisfied we know all we need to know 
bush said hed like to see plo chairman yasser arafat speak out 
ive expressed my outrage about the attack bush said maybe 
i can take this opportunity to express my outrage about all the 
violence in the middle east 
asked if he was planned to cut off the usplo dialogue bush 
said we are discussing all of that no decision has been made 
arafat has denied any plo involvement in last months raid but 
has not condemned the act outright 
the palestine liberation front a plo faction claimed 
responsibility for the raid in which six speedboats attempted to 
attack a crowded beach but were intercepted by israeli security 
forces the plf is headed by mohammed abbas who uses the name abul 
abbas and who masterminded the achille lauro cruise ship hijacking 
in washington white house deputy press secretary roman popadiuk 
said the administration has received some information about the 
attack from the israelis 
separately an administration official said a decision was not 
expected for a number of days the official who declined to be 
identified said the united states has held at least four meetings 
with plo representatives since the raid to discuss the 
organizations views on it 
on the subject of the possible formation of a new rightwing 
government in israel bush said that was an internal matter for 
israel 
israel can do what it wants with this government and ill work 
with whoever that country puts forward as their government bush 
said but they know the policy of the united states on peace 
talks us policy is firm we want the peace talks to begin 
diplomatic sources in washington said earlier in the day that the 
united states had decided to suspend the talks and would make the 
announcement next week the sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the administration would cite the attack and the 
plos decision not to condemn the action 
baker in turnberry scotland for a nato foreign ministers 
meeting said terrorism is not the sole issue in deciding whether 
the united states will suspend its 16month dialogue with the plo 
it is important that we pursue peace in the middle east in a 
serious manner baker told a news conference asked if he meant to 
suggest the impact a cutoff might have on middle east peace talks 
would outweigh the us antiterrorism policy baker said 
i dont want to seem to be suggesting in any way that we would 
countenance terrorism in order to advance the noble cause of peace 
baker told reporters the talks were continuing while the 
administration sought to find out all we need to know about the 
circumstances he declined to say what information was still 
lacking 
the dialogue with the plo carried out by robert pelletreau the 
us ambassador in tunisia where the organization has its 
headquarters was begun after plo chairman yasser arafat renounced 
terrorism and recognized israels right to exist in december 1988 
the us government said it would end all contact at any time if 
the plo failed to live up to its renunciation of terrorism 
the may 30 assault by palestine liberation front guerrillas was 
thwarted by israeli forces plf leaders said the attack was aimed at 
a military target but israeli officials say they have proof the aim 
was to murder civilians 
arafat said the plo had nothing to do with the operation but he 
has been unwilling to condemn it and said he had no authority to 
throw the plfs representative of the plo executive committee

a republican official says democrats may have 
deliberately sabotaged their own state convention with a police 
demonstration and then falsely blamed the gop 
democrats have accused the springfield police union and white 
house aide ronald kaufman with trying to embarrass the party and 
disrupt the convention with a police picket line outside the hall 
last saturday 
the protest disrupted the democratic convention at the 
springfield civic center nearly forcing its cancellation 
it will be very interesting when all is said and done who 
really caused the problems in springfield state gop executive 
director alexander tennant said thursday 
tennant offered no proof for his accusations and democrats have 
offered little proof for their accusations against kaufman saying 
he met briefly with the police union president the night before the 
picketing 
robert jacobson president of the springfield police union which 
backed george bush over gov michael s dukakis in the 1988 
presidential campaign denied democrats or republicans had anything 
to do with the picketing 
he said the union picketed to call attention to its problems with 
springfield mayor mary hurley over getting a contract 
republicans suggested thursday that democratic gubernatorial 
candidate john silber and senate president william bulger also a 
democrat may have been behind the police demonstration 
the state democratic party has sued the police union and has 
vowed to sue kaufman over the demonstration tennant said 
republicans intend to seek depositions from silber bulger and 
others 
it will become clearer and clearer that the republican party 
had nothing to do with this and that there was a conspiracy 
tennant said 
robert donahue silbers campaign manager called the republican 
suggestion ludicrous beyond belief 
bulger spokesman paul mahoney said we had absolutely nothing 
to do with any strike or disruption

barbara bush devoted part of her 65th birthday 
friday to a favorite task reading to children and recalled that 
she and president bush did that often when their kids were young 
it was a chance for us to put an arm around a child and have a 
special time said the first lady it does a lot for bonding 
with your children and it pays off later 
mrs bush appeared on abctvs good morning america and read 
to a dozen children seated around her the story was leo the late 
bloomer about a lion who was slow to learn to read and write 
the children responded with a chorus of happy birthday mrs 
bush 
oh howd you know she asked who told you that secret 
thank you very very much 
a day earlier she had said she could not care less about her 
birthday she was born june 8 1925 in new york city 
bush telephoned wishes from iowa where he was finishing a 
fourstate political trip he told reporters that she seemed 
unexcited about her 65th birthday 
the national pork producers council gave the president a box of 
pork chops and several bags of pork rinds a favorite snack and he 
quipped maybe thats what ill give to barbara for her birthday 
present 
the first lady who made literacy a personal crusade said on the 
television program that about the most important thing that 
parents can do for their children is to get them excited about and 
start them reading 
that she said is because parents are the first teachers 
my first memories of my mother and father are my mother curled 
up on a couch reading and my dad reading she said its a proven 
fact now that children who are read to do better in school 
mrs bush recommended letting children pick the books they are 
interested in then reading to them 
were not talking about hours she said were talking a 
little bit about a way of life have books out have books 
available you dont have to buy them have them there so the 
child can pick up a book not just story books but books about 
science or whatever you think your child might be interested in 
it is quality time maybe its 15 minutes a night maybe its 
allowing your child to pick a book they want to read themselves to 
sleep to its just a way of life and its a very easy to 
establish 
mrs bush spoke also about the time she spent last week with 
soviet first lady raisa gorbachev who was in this country with 
president mikhail gorbachev 
she told me that she herself as a working woman had turned 
down promotions so she could be home with her family mrs bush

to some philadelphians it was an electrical 
jolt as shocking as ben franklins kiteflying experiment 
the psfs sign was turned off 
the 27foothigh red neon letters which have glowed atop the 
39story psfs building for 58 years were turned off may 21 because 
the bank inside the building no longer owns the rights to the 
letters 
the reasons are complicated but to some architectural 
historians the result is simply a mistake 
because of mergers and acquisitions in corporate america the 
signs turned off william blades executive director of the 
philadelphia historic preservation corp said thursday its 
silly 
the untrained eye may consider the 491foot building at 12th and 
market streets just another modern skyscraper not too big not too 
dazzling 
building buffs however positively gush when they talk about it 
in 1932 architects george howe and william lescaze they say 
designed the first truly modern american skyscraper lovingly 
detailed and way ahead of its time 
and the sign says susan shearer past president of the society 
for commercial archaeology is an integral part of the building 
and an important element in the landscape of philadelphia 
to turn off the sign she said is to eliminate a major 
part of the archictectural statement 
until the mid1980s philadelphia custom dictated that no 
building be higher than the statue of william penn that crowns city 
hall and the psfs building then the citys second tallest 
structure was a dominant feature of the skyline 
if this was a billboard thats been up there two years thats 
another issue blades said but this is a national historic 
landmark 
sign supporters point out that it is the countrys first 
largescale illuminated graphic on the countrys first modernist 
skyscraper housing the countrys first savings bank 
the bank in question was the philadelphia saving fund society 
founded in 1816 as the nations first savings bank for regular folk 
not just businesses 
it became known as simply psfs this year psfss parent meritor 
savings bank sold 54 psfs branches and the psfs name to mellon bank 
corp 
meritor is staying in the building and keeping 29 branches using 
the new name philadelphia savings fund society 
but since it no longer has the legal rights to the name psfs 
meritor decided to turn off the sign the sign itself must stay 
protected by the landmark designation 
legally we have no right to the psfs name and thats why the 
sign is off said leslie voth vice president of corporate 
communications for meritor mellon bought the rights to the psfs 
name if they wanted it illuminated they would have to pay for it 
mellon spokeswoman becky brinks offered nostalgic philadelphians 
a hint of hope were certainly willing to discuss the 
possibility she said

a woman telephoned police to say she had 
just killed her husband and motherinlaw then after asking the 
police to take care of her dog she shot and killed herself 
authorities said 
the three dead were identified as lorraine napieralski 42 her 
husband anthony 43 and his mother theresa 63 
ive just killed my husband a detective quoted lorraine 
napieralski as saying in her phone call to police shortly after 5 
am ive just killed my motherinlaw im about to kill myself 
please take care of my dog 
police said they made it to the napieralski home in this buffalo 
suburb in one minute but not in time to prevent mrs napieralski 
from killing herself 
detective lt thomas rowan said police are aware of a motive in 
the killings but were not going to talk about it at this point 
its a tragic family matter and not much else is going to be served 
at this point by talking about it 
the first officers to arrive found mrs napieralski on a living 
room couch and the two others in their bedrooms all three were 
pronounced dead at the scene of gunshot wounds 
we believe the husband was shot first said rowan we 
believe the mother motherinlaw was shot next the woman then 
called the police and took her own life 
investigators found the dog taffy unharmed later in the 
morning the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals picked 
up the animal 
napieralski was a former worker for the internal revenue service

ohio gov richard celeste defended his 
wifes fairly earthy advocacy of gay and lesbian rights and 
shrugged off suggestions of political damage 
whats the embarrassment celeste said when asked about 
remarks by his wife dagmar ill bet you there are a lot of 
people around here who say fairly earthy things 
celeste who heads the democratic governors association was in 
iowa for private meetings with democratic activists and candidates 
and to tape a television debate on peace issues but he found 
himself questioned thursday about a newspaper account of a speech 
his wife delivered to a group of homosexual advocates in cincinnati 
the cleveland plain dealer reported earlier this week that mrs 
celeste quoted sexually explicit language from a lesbian author in 
asserting her support of gay rights during the april speech the 
plain dealer based its account on a report in the cincinnatibased 
gaybeat newspaper 
mrs celeste said her remarks were taken out of context she was 
attending the cincinnati dinner to accept an award on behalf of the 
governor who was honored for opposing discrimination against 
homosexuals 
it was a surprise to me that a newspaper would write a story 
about an event that occurred in april based solely on a report in 
an advocacy journal that they would normally never use as a basis 
for a story and treat it as an objective description of the 
events the governor said 
celeste occasionally mentioned as a democratic presidential 
candidate made a similar tentative foray into iowa in 1987 to talk 
with party activists but decided against running for president

students and colleagues of american 
educator thomas sutherland gathered at the american university of 
beirut on friday to mark a grim milestone the passing of 
sutherlands fifth year as a hostage in lebanon 
sutherland begins his sixth year in captivity saturday in the 
time since he was captured june 9 1985 the only word on his 
welfare has come from former hostages who were held with him 
the proiranian group that holds him islamic jihad has never 
issued a photograph of sutherland as it has its other captives 
the four things that mean the most to tom are his home his 
family his work and his friends and he found all four of those 
here in beirut and at aub sutherlands wife jean told the 
gathering at the lecture hall in the universitys agriculture 
facility 
one of those attending was elham cicippio the wife of american 
hostage joseph cicippio who was the acting comptroller at the 
american university of beirut he was kidnapped sept 12 1986 
people who have come out from where he is and who have been 
with him say that tom speaks and thinks of aub and wants to come 
back mrs sutherland said 
the scottishborn sutherland 59 of fort collins colo was 
dean of agriculture and food sciences at the american university of 
beirut when he was kidnapped june 8 1985 
in addition to sutherland and cicippio 14 other westerners are 
missing in lebanon the hostage held longest is terry anderson 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press who was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 next to anderson sutherland has been held 
the longest 
most of the hostages are held by proiranian shiite factions 
mrs sutherland still lives at the american university in moslem 
west beirut continuing the work she and her husband were doing when 
he was abducted 
tom and i are ordinary people she said friday we came 
here to do a job the job is still to be done and were still doing 
it 
all that we know is that he has life and health and work to do 
and we will continue with that work she added 
she said what her husband is going through is only a 
reflection a shadow of what the people in lebanon have gone 
through in 15 years of civil war 
she and the students pinned photographs of sutherland in happier 
times to a board in the hall 
what tom would say to the faculty of agriculture and food 
sciences is we have our memories on the board out there but we 
dont go to the past mrs sutherland said 
lets not let this time be a time of sadness but rather a time 
of gladness she added 
we hope that when he comes out it means reconciliation it 
means that people are not divided that people are on their way to 
work together in peace and harmony she said 
the sutherlands have three daughters ann 32 kit 30 and joan 
26 they all live and work in the united states 
former hostages have told mrs sutherland that her husbands 
captors had given him a picture she had placed in a newspaper of his 
only granddaughter simone 3 who was born after his abduction 
sutherland was seized as he drove from the airport after arriving 
from the united states to attend the graduation of his students 
mrs sutherland said in an interview with the associated press that 
her husband had been hesitant about returning to beirut because of 
the civil war and kidnappings 
but somehow there werent any further indications that things 
were any worse than they had been and he made that decision to 
go she said 
she recalled that in the last week before he returned to beirut 
an interviewer asked her husband whether he was afraid 
he said if im going to be afraid id better not be there 
she added we made the choice to come we made the choice to 
stay and i know that tom always felt that it was worth it 
we always had the sense that if somebody can make it tom will 
because hes a very strong person but hes also a very sensitive 
person and i know that for him this has been an ordeal because his 
work is his life mrs sutherland said 
so i try to to carry on the sense of that work and i feel 
everything i do is tom and i doing it together she added

oh jamie willard wished he was an oscar 
mayer wiener that is what he truly wanted to be and if he drove 
around in a 23footlong hot dog people on the street certainly 
would be agog 
willard is one of 13 college graduates to complete a oscar mayer 
food corp training program this week to drive the motorized 
promotional hot dog around the country for the madisonbased food 
provider 
willard says he plans to relish his new job 
i loved the commercials but i never thought id be doing 
this he said this is going to be the best job in the world 
willard who graduated last month from aquinas college in grand 
rapids mich and his hotdogger colleagues will be divided into 
groups of two and will cruise around the country in the 23footlong 
hot dog vehicle 
while cruising the united states the vehicle will make 
promotional stops 
the hotdogger training includes classes on the history of oscar 
mayer and how to deal with the public although the real test is 
when the driver gets behind the wheel of the giant dog for the first 
time 
after russell coy a graduate of new mexico state university in 
las cruces mustered up the courage to get into the cockpitlike 
drivers seat he said it felt good to be honking and waving at 
surprised people on the street and in cars 
i feel like im the top dog coy declared 
hot dog jokes have been passed down through the three classes of 
hotdoggers who warn newcomers against such job hazards as getting 
grilled by reporters

a former army sergeant responsible for 
safeguarding sensitive documents was arrested on charges he 
conspired to sell information on the nuclear defense of europe to 
hungary and czechoslovakia the fbi said 
this represents a hemorrhage of extremely sensitive information 
which caused grave danger to the united states and its nato 
allies fbi agent allen mccreight said we think it has major 
implications 
roderick james ramsay 28 was arrested without incident thursday 
night on a downtown street he being held at an undisclosed 
location he was scheduled to appear today before a federal 
magistrate 
the fbi has been investigating ramsay for about two years and has 
conducted a covert surveillance of him for some time said a law 
enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in washington a justice department spokesman said that the 
information that ramsay is accused of helping provide the hungarian 
and czech spy agencies eventually fell into the hands of the soviet 
kgb 
this is a significant case from the point of view of us 
security interests said spokesman doug tillett it involves an 
extensive amount of information provided to the soviet intelligence 
service kbg through eastern european surrogates 
ramsay worked in west germany from 1983 to 1985 directly under 
clyde lee conrad 43 a retired us army sergeant convicted of 
treason by a west german court and given a life sentence earlier 
this week the fbi said it said ramsays arrest stemmed from the 
investigation of conrad 
an affidavit filed in court noted that in january 1986 conrad 
visited ramsay in boston gave him a cow bell and told him that 
anyone displaying a similar cow bell was involved in the spy ring 
ramsay said he kept the bell and had it at his mothers tampa home 
until april when he turned it over to federal authorities said an 
affidavit signed by fbi agent joe navarro 
ramsay acknowledged to navarro that he was recruited by conrad 
and participated in spying activities while in the army the 
affidavit said he also told the agent that he had topsecret 
documents at his mothers house that he had planned to sell in the 
future navarro said but destroyed them in august 1988 
ramsay was charged with conspiracy to gather or deliver defense 
information to aid a foreign government the fbi said 
that information included sensitive documents on the use of 
tactical nuclear weapons by us forces and nato allies and plans 
for the defense of central europe the justice department said in a 
news release 
its fair to say the information would have been very useful to 
the soviet union us attorney robert genzman said he refused to 
confirm whether the east bloc countries passed it on to the soviets 
fbi agents said the sevenyear nationwide investigation into the 
alleged spy ring was continuing they refused to say how many people 
were involved 
fbi director william s sessions said the investigation was one 
of the most complicated of its kind ever undertaken by the bureau 
and the information passed on was extremely sensitive 
court papers filed in the case charge that for 20000 ramsay 
gave conrad the documents as well as technical manuals about 
military communications technology and material about the 
coordination of nato forces 
the material was passed to hungarian and czechoslovakian 
intelligence agents according to the court papers 
ramsay worked directly under conrad in the 8th infantry division 
g3 plans section in bad kreuznach as the assistant document 
custodian the g3 section of a division is in charge of the units 
military operations 
ramsays duties included safeguarding all classified and military 
documents he held a topsecret clearance 
the affidavit charged that in december 1985 ramsay videotaped 
hundreds of documents and gave them to conrad for their eventual 
sale to the czechs and hungarians 
conrad was arrested in august 1988 the trial judge in his case 
said his offense passing secrets to hungary and czechoslovakia 
from 1975 through 1985 in return for 12 million endangered the 
entire defense capability of the west 
it could have led to a breakdown in the defenses of the western 
alliance and to capitulation and the use of nuclear weapons on 
german territory said ferdinand schuth chief judge of the court 
in the west german state of rhinelandpalatinate where the spying 
occurred 
according to court records conrad was introduced to the 
hungarian secret service in late fall 1975 by his supervisor in the 
8th infantry division former us army sgt 1st class zoltan szabo 
szabo was convicted of espionage in austria in 1989 and received 
a 10month suspended sentence he identified for investigators some 
of the documents the court said conrad sold to the hungarians 
ramsay faces a maximum penalty of life imprisonment if convicted 
of espionage conspiracy

a giant titan 4 rocket thundered into 
orbit friday with whats believed to be a military surveillance 
satellite air force officials said the early morning launch went 
smoothly 
it was the second launch of the nations most powerful unmanned 
space rocket and one of three planned for this year 
everything went very well it was a beautiful sight to 
behold said air force col frank stirling director of the titan 
program it was a great step for us in the air force to get the 
second titan 4 launched on time as planned 
the 173 million rocket blasted off at 122 am from cape 
canaveral air force station it resembled a large ball of fire as it 
cut through clouds on its way toward an undisclosed orbit 
the air force refused to discuss or even acknowledge the flight 
until it issued a statement about 20 minutes after liftoff the 
payload was not revealed but civilian experts believe it is an 
electronic eavesdropping satellite or a missilewarning spacecraft 
a titan 4 successfully boosted a missilewarning satellite into 
orbit in june 1989 even though an engine nozzle malfunctioned 
stirling said the problem was corrected and did not occur in 
fridays launch 
martin marietta space launch systems has a 71 billion contract 
with the air force to supply 41 titan 4 rockets with an option for 
eight more the goal is to have 75 by the end of 1997 which would 
put the cost of the program at 17 billion stirling said 
the air force ordered the rocket in 1985 to serve as a 
complimentary launch vehicle to nasas manned space shuttle the 
most powerful cargo carrier used by the united states 
the shuttle is capable of putting a 52000pound payload into 
orbit the titan 4 which stands 20 stories tall can lift a 
39000pound cargo into low earth orbit or carry 10000 pounds to 
stationary orbit 22300 miles high 
after the 1986 challenger explosion the air force revamped the 
program and targeted the titan 4 as its primary booster for heavy 
pentagon payloads 
stirling said the switch from an offtheshelf rocket to one 
of shuttle caliber led to schedule delays and a 209 million in cost 
overruns as of july 1989 
the us general accounting office cited program delays and cost 
overruns in a report last month noting that 10 rockets originally 
were to have been launched by october 
the rocket launched friday could have gone up several months ago 
but its payload was not ready stirling said 
the air force plans to launch two more titan 4 rockets this year 
from either cape canaveral or vandenberg stirling said several 
rockets are at each site ready to go he said 
smaller rockets such as the delta and atlas will be used to carry 
lighter payloads stirling said the space shuttle will be used only 
if astronauts assistance or the shuttles unique capabilities are 
required he said 
atlantis is scheduled to carry a secret military payload into 
orbit next month it will be the seventh shuttle mission dedicated 
to the defense department only a few remain on the shuttle flight 
manifest 
right now the idea is to have a robust and capable launch 
vehicle program that stands alone based on a mixed fleet so we 
never get into a posture again of having to rely on a single means 
of access to space which is in many regards technically fragile 
stirling said

explorers shimmied through a 42inch hole to poke 
around one of eight icebound world war ii aircraft in southeastern 
greenland for the first time and found it in good condition 
expedition officials said friday 
richard taylor who is supervising the the greenland expedition 
societys effort to recover the planes radioed the societys 
suburban atlanta headquarters 
we have been down to the plane and gotten inside it its 
condition is good and just as we all hoped it would be 
taylor and gordon scott entered the b17 bomber wednesday pat 
epps the societys founder said friday 
on wednesday epps said the group succeeded in reaching the plane 
for the first time and would try to get inside by descending 250 
feet through a 42inch shaft in the ice 
the b17 bomber is one of eight us planes two b17s and six 
twinengine p138 lightning fighters that crashlanded on the 
greenland icecap on july 15 1942 they ran out of fuel en route to 
europe after being given false radio transmissions from german 
submarines the crews survived 
epps owner of an air service in suburban atlanta said the 
salvage team which has been in greenland since may reached the 
buried bomber by digging through 250 feet of ice with a thermal 
borer 
we plan to get the fighters out this year he said we will 
work until september 1 
the greenland expedition society has worked to find the aircraft 
for almost a decade in 1988 its members found the planes by using 
lowfrequency subsurface radar last year they drilled down to the 
b17 and brought back poker chipsize pieces of its skin

scientists have produced a calf with a human 
hormone gene and three others with extra cattle genes in research 
that could lead to leaner beef and cows that give more milk 
the three bulls and one heifer were given the extra genes while 
still embryos as part of a continuing project at the diamond g ranch 
in southeast texas 
in addition 60 to 70 cows at the ranch are pregnant with 
genetically altered embryos 
im not willing to say any of the animals we have produced or 
those were about to produce will have commercial value said ken 
bondioli a senior scientist at granada biosciences of houston 
this is research in its infancy theres a lot of potential there 
we dont think we have all the answers 
the human gene is carried by the eldest of granadas experimental 
cattle a 15monthold bull researchers said thursday the animal 
has not grown as large as researchers anticipated but they still 
hope the gene altering could lead to strong healthy cattle without 
the use of steroids 
steroids have been linked to heart disease and impotence 
the purpose of these kinds of things is to prevent disease 
make animals more immune to particular kinds of diseases said 
david eller granadas chairman in the broad analysis its to 
make foodproducing animals more economical for producers to grow 
and more healthy for the dietconscious healthconscious consumers 
of today 
researchers have experimented successfully with gene altering in 
chickens pigs sheep and laboratory animals human genes have also 
been previously inserted into farm animals 
but the granada experiments are believed to be the first 
performed on cattle in the united states genealtered cows have 
been produced in europe and canada 
the testing is being done by biondoli bert omalley a cell 
biologist at houstons bayor college of medicine and robert hammer 
a physiologist at the howard hughes medical institute in dallas 
to produce their first genetically engineered bull the 
scientists used a human estrogen gene reproduced in the lab to 
promote growth the hope was that an animal with the extra gene 
would enjoy the same benefits steroids provide without the health 
risks 
the first bull however did not show any abnormally fast or 
healthy growth 
a second bull was born last september a heifer was born three 
months later the fourth a bull was born last march these three 
calves received additional bovine genes 
the two bulls received an insulingrowth factor gene designed to 
promote growth the cow received a growth hormone gene which the 
scientists hope will promote milk production

a texas businessman stung in a federal 
crackdown on child labor law violations cautioned congress friday 
against letting governmental paternalism ruin worthwhile work 
opportunities for youngsters 
donald farrell said jobs like those he provides give youngsters 
especially those from unstable homes a chance to earn money 
experience and selfrespect the dallas business farrell owns is 
under investigation for allegedly letting nearly 300 children 
illegally sell newspaper subscriptions at night 
please do not allow misguided idealism and governmental 
paternalism to close that door they desperately need an alternative 
to the street corner and the dangers associated with that 
irresponsible lifestyle farrell told the house government 
operations employment and housing subcommittee 
farrell faces 150000 in fines for alleged violations uncovered 
in a nationwide labor department sweep in march he was one of 
several business officials who testified as the panel continued 
hearings on protecting children in the workplace 
executives from mcdonalds burger king and dominos pizza said 
they had implemented programs to ensure that young employees do not 
work in violation of federal law youngsters may only work 
restricted hours and are prohibited from working at dangerous 
machines such as paper balers dough machines and meat slicers 
two high school students also testified saying their grades had 
slipped because they were devoting too much time to their jobs 
christopher randolph a senior from clifton park ny said 
teenagers were easy marks for exploitation 
our natural naivete and intuitive trust of adults makes us easy 
prey said randolph adding that his former restaurant job 
frequently kept him at work until 11 pm two hours beyond the 
legal time 
congress is considering legislation to increase civil fines for 
child labor law violations from 1000 a violation to 10000 the 
legislation also would require jail terms for repeat and willful 
offenders 
along with congressional attention the labor department has 
stepped up its enforcement the nationwide sweep conducted in march 
uncovered 15000 alleged violations federal agents followed with a 
oneday effort this week by visiting another 2000 establishments

a judge ordered the press and public 
out of his courtroom friday while hearing arguments on key evidence 
in the case against two brothers charged with the shotgun slayings 
of their parents 
superior court judge james albracht closed a hearing on the 
question of whether the records of a psychiatrist who treated erik 
and lyle menendez are admissable evidence 
gerald chaleff attorney for lyle menendez asked that the 
hearing be held in secret saying that it concerned matters of the 
psychiatrists privilege and could not be held in public without 
violating that privilege 
i apologize for these in camera closed proceedings albracht 
told reporters and spectators in the crowded courtroom i hope you 
can understand the reason for closing some of these proceedings 
privilege would not matter much if we had to discuss those 
privileged matters in public 
albracht said however that the material discussed in tape 
recordings seized from the doctor have never been disclosed to him 
because of their sensitivity 
i think freedom of the press is very important he said after 
several reporters raised their hands and asked to be heard on the 
issue but ive given this a lot of thought and we simply cannot 
proceed in public when we discuss matters of privilege 
the brothers are accused of murdering jose menendez 45 and his 
wife kitty 44 in the familys beverly hills mansion on aug 20 
the couple was hit numerous times with shotgun blasts 
menendez was a wealthy executive of live entertainment inc a 
video distribution firm 
the brothers said they found the bodies of their parents when 
they returned home from a night out prosecutors allege the brothers 
were motivated to kill their parents to claim their fathers fortune

the sight of a nearly empty senate chamber 
friday proved the last straw for majority leader george j mitchell 
the maine democrat announced to a half dozen of his 
98000ayear colleagues and about four times as many tourists that 
he was going to force some elected noses to the grindstone other 
senators were milling about elsewhere in the capitol 
were just reaching the point where it is very very difficult 
to move forward on any piece of legislation said mitchell the 
man who is supposed to make things happen in the senate couldnt 
force completion of action on any of four bills on his menu this 
week 
the frustration over absences delays filibusters and endless 
amendments had been building 
it is intolerable that the senate cannot function if one of a 
few senators have something else to do on one of the three days of 
the week of the three weeks of the month that the senate is supposed 
to be in session and working he said thursday after trying to 
juggle next weeks voting schedule 
senators have quit holding votes on mondays and fridays 
presumably so they can visit with the people who elected them 
friday was an exception that mitchell is suggesting he might make 
permanent 
the majority leader is threatening to make mondays and fridays 
voting days hold votes in the morning make lawmakers burn the 
midnight oil other than on thursdays and cut into the fourweek 
august recess 
he didnt mention having the sergeantatarms make midnight 
arrests and physically carry reluctant lawmakers to the senate 
floor democrats under former majority leader robert c byrd of west 
virginia resorted to that tactic in february 1988 
mitchell said he understood that two senators were in 
czechoslovakia to monitor elections and others were attending 
graduations and he said he understood the need for senators to 
sound out their constituents for advice 
but those actions are not a substitute for but in connection 
with and in preparation for activity which occurs on the senate 
floor all other considerations must give way to that overriding 
public consideration 
sen robert dole the minority leader told mitchell that he 
could lead senators to the floor but couldnt make them pass bills 
i think i tried them all but none of them worked said dole 
who was once majority leader being on the floor doesnt mean 
were going to do anything in that time 
dole argued that the minority republicans have their own view of 
what legislation is important and must use the available tactics 
such as filibusters and offering irrelevant amendments to affect 
the flow of bills 
the senate this past week was unable to complete action on a 
crimefighting measure a bill to change timber management at the 
tongass national forest in alaska an override of the presidential 
veto of the amtrak authorizing bill and a bill to let blind airline 
passengers sit in exitrow seats 
the senate still has to deal with major pieces of legislation 
like the budget defense civil rights and farm programs

greek prime minister constantine mitsotakis 
said friday that turkish military forces on the island of cyprus are 
a blot on the reputation of nato and urged president george bush 
to press turkey to get out 
mitsotakis also said he had promised bush in their wednesday 
meeting that his newly elected new democracy party would rid greece 
of the antiamerican and palestinian terrorism that plagued the 
socialist government of his predecessor andreas papandreou 
my government intends to end the friction in relations with 
washington that was evident during the eight years of socialist rule 
in greece said mitsotakis whose meeting with bush was the first 
visit by a greek leader to the white house in 26 years 
us officials say relations with greece have already improved 
since the conservative prime minister came to power in april 
mitsotakis a newspaper publisher and veteran politician said he 
had told bush and other us leaders that at a time when the soviet 
union has pulled out of afghanistan and south africa had withdrawn 
from namibia turkeys continued occupation of cyprus is a 
terrible blot on the reputation of the entire western alliance 
mitsotakis addressed reporters and members of the greek community 
at a national press club luncheon before departing for new york 
turkey invaded the mediterranean island in 1974 in what it 
described as a move to protect the cypriot turkish community from 
the greek majority cyprus has been divided into two regions with a 
un force keeping the peace 
the members of nato and especially the united states can do 
much to end the cyprus crisis and the time is now he said 
un efforts begun last year to start peace talks between the 
sides have failed to progress 
the united states has refused to become involved in the feud 
between greece and turkey both members of the 16nation north 
atlantic treaty organization preferring to let the united nations 
mediate bush discussed the issue this week at a white house 
luncheon with un secretary general javier perez de cuellar 
mitsotakis said he had made clear to the united states his 
governments desire to resolve the cyprus problem in order to 
improve ties with turkey but he added the united states has it in 
its power to press turkey into changing its policies 
the greek premier said he had told bush his government would 
decide before the end of september whether to extradite mohammed 
rashid a palestinian wanted here in connection with a 1982 pan am 
bombing the case has been stalled by papandreous government 
in any case we will never let rashid free he promised 
mitsotakis said that rashid would either be handed over to the 
united states or put on trial in greece

william merica doesnt want to make a mountain 
out of a molehill but he did discover what a harvard researcher 
says is one of the nations largest anthills 
merica was walking down a road last month in this small town 
south of baltimore when he saw what appeared to a moving mound of 
dirt 
i thought the sun was playing tricks on me when i looked at 
it said merica 
at first i thought the whole hill was moving but then i looked 
up close and my god it was just solid ants it was unbelievable 
about 500000 allegheny ants constructed the 3foot high 
8by15foot oval mound which is the largest in a sixmound area 
connected by a 115yard ant highway 
ive spent a lot of time in the woods camping and hunting and 
whatever and i have never seen anything like it merica said 
merica reported his find to state and county officials 
harvard university researcher stefan cover said it probably took 
the ants at least four years to build the mound 
some termites are known to build larger nests in the tropics but 
the allegheny ants build the largest mounds in the united states and 
among the largest in the world said cover an assistant curator of 
the worlds largest ant collection at harvard he said the largest 
allegheny mound he has even seen was 8 feet across 
state entomologist gaye williams identified the arnold ants as 
formica exsectoides a harmless species native to maryland 
its a very nice ant very handsome and very strong but it is 
of no importance other than as a curiosity said williams who 
studies plays with and even eats insects as well as occasionally 
wearing jewelry made of them 
the individual ants look like common red ants about a 
quarterinch long with red heads and bodies and black bottoms 
cover explained that the ants are able to build such enormous 
colonies because unlike most ants they do not harbor tribal 
prejudices 
in most ant species queens are intolerant of other queens and 
the separate nests compete with one another for food but with 
exsectoides the mounds can contain 30 or 40 queens working 
together cover said 
the separate mounds even cooperate and seem to communicate with 
each other forming a sort of united nations of the ant world he 
said

a nuclear regulatory commission investigation 
concluded friday that an accident that cut electrical power to 
safety systems at a georgia nuclear power plant last march could 
have been prevented 
but investigators praised operators at plant vogtle near 
waynesboro ga for restoring power to a reactors cooling system 
within 36 minutes after a truck accident knocked out one power 
system and a backup generator failed twice to kick in automatically 
my personal opinion is we ought to congratulate those 
operators nrc chairman kenneth carr said after the special 
investigative team briefed the commission on its findings 
they were operating without a full deck of cards and they 
did a heroic job to get it back in 36 minutes he said 
the accident occurred march 20 while the plants unit 1 reactor 
was shut down for refueling two of the four electric power sources 
for unit 1 safety systems were out of service at the time and the 
reactors cooling system was open for maintenance 
a fuel delivery truck knocked out one of the two remaining power 
sources when it backed into a support column in an electrical 
switchyard at the plant during the 36 minutes it took to get the 
backup diesel generator started the temperature in the reactor 
cooling system increased from 90 to 136 degrees fahrenheit 
the accident also triggered an automatic shutdown of the unit 2 
reactor which was operating at full power because of a wiring 
error that had gone undetected since the plant was constructed 
carr said there never was any real serious danger that the 
loss of the unit 1 reactor cooling system would have damaged the 
reactor core and resulted in a release of radioactivity but he said 
the incident can provide lessons to improve the safety of nuclear 
plants 
ken mccoy georgia power co vice president in charge of plant 
vogtle agreed with carrs assessment and with the investigative 
teams conclusion that the accident could have been prevented 
i never felt uncomfortable that there was ever any real threat 
of a release of radioactive material mccoy said the operators 
were well trained and they did an outstanding job of getting the 
unit back on line

president mikhail s gorbachev on friday reiterated 
warnings that he will curb the emigration of soviet jews unless they 
stop settling in the israelioccupied territories 
this is a very serious matter gorbachev said he urged 
israel to heed his warnings against west bank and gaza strip 
settlements made during last weeks summit in washington 
i hope that israel will listen and then this process of 
jewish emigration can go on normally and we wont be forced to 
introduce any corrections gorbachev told a news conference 
if the situation became such that we have to react we probably 
will have to apply our sovereign rights our competence and act 
he said 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain who was visiting 
moscow joined gorbachev at the news conference answering an arab 
journalist said settlement of soviet jewish emigres on the west 
bank was wrong she said israel not gorbachev was to blame 
it is wrong that people who leave the soviet union should be 
placed in the occupied territories which we really regard as 
belonging to someone else and not the state of israel said mrs 
thatcher 
i think it is almost letting down those of us who have 
campaigned vigorously for jewish emigration rights 
a record number of jews are leaving the soviet union following 
gorbachevs lifting of emigration curbs 
israel says some 35000 soviet jews have arrived this year and as 
many as 150000 are expected but that only a few hundred have 
so far settled in the west bank 
israel says it has no policy of directing soviet jews to the 
occupied territories where there are some 17 million palestinians 
and about 70000 jewish settlers the palestinian uprising against 
the 23yearold occupation is now 2 years old

the 4yearold state of 
emergency was lifted everywhere in the country friday but in a 
region torn by black factional fighting and a black union demanded 
the emergency be ended there too 
president fw de klerk announced thursday the emergency would 
end at midnight friday in three of the countrys four provinces 
the action removes some of the harshest political restrictions 
ever imposed by the countrys white rulers and should help clear the 
way for blackwhite negotiations on ending apartheid 
the end of the emergency is an important step in the 
normalization of our society and is an illustration of the 
governments declared policy to affirm the rule of law in a 
democratic south africa said justice minister kobie coetsee 
but in the eastern province of natal and the adjoining kwazulu 
homeland police still have sweeping powers to detain people without 
charge and break up demonstrations 
the government had indicated it would keep the measures in effect 
in natal and it formally announced the decision friday in the 
official government gazette 
black factional fighting has claimed more than 4000 lives in 
natal since 1986 about 500 people were killed in clashes during 
first three months of this year 
the countrys largest black labor federation criticized the 
government for extending the emergency decree in natal saying it 
was a pretext for police to continue abusing blacks 
our experience of the state of emergency in natal is that it 
has provided a cover for the security forces to terrorize the 
people said the congress of south african trade unions which is 
allied with the african national congress 
retaining the state of emergency in natal can only worsen the 
conflict not resolve it the federation said 
the anc the countrys most powerful black organization has also 
condemned the retention of the state of emergency in natal 
the main combatants in natal are supporters of the anc and 
members of inkatha a relatively conservative zulu organization 
the anc has said that in order for there to be blackwhite 
negotiations on a new constitution the government must lift the 
state of emergency release political prisoners and allow exiles to 
return 
de klerk wants to work out a constitution with opposition groups 
that will lead to sharing of power between the 5 million whites and 
28 million blacks who under apartheid have no voice in national 
affairs 
meanwhile the proapartheid conservative party said the end of 
the state of emergency in cape transvaal and orange free state 
provinces would lead to chaos and further alienate rightwing whites 
disgruntled with de klerks reforms 
conservative leader andries treunicht said the government should 
have required the anc to renounce its armed struggle against 
apartheid before the state of emergency was lifted 
but leading newspapers praised de klerks decision 
the cape times said the action will have a steadying effect at 
home while once more demonstrating to the world de klerks firm 
commitment to a negotiated settlement 
even for the cynics the lifting of the state of emergency will 
mean more space however small has been cleared for political 
activity said the sowetan a blackoriented newspaper 
during the national emergency more than 30000 activists most 
of them black were detained without charge for varying lengths of 
time thousands more went into hiding after former president pw 
botha imposed the restrictions on june 12 1986 
about 300 activists were being held under the emergency 
regulations as of friday most of them in natal

voters cast ballots friday in 
czechoslovakias first free elections following four decades of 
communist rule bringing democracy to their country only months 
after the overthrow of their hardline rulers 
president vaclav havel the former dissident playwright elected 
by parliament in december after a peaceful revolution was loudly 
cheered as he walked with his wife olga from his central prague home 
to vote 
jostled by the crowd of about 200 people as the couple emerged 
from the polling station minutes later olga was asked how it felt 
to vote freely 
beautiful she said 
voters dressed in their sunday best turned out in moderate 
numbers across prague for the twoday election to choose the 300 
deputies that will sit in a new federal parliament also at stake 
were seats for the regional parliaments in the czech and slovak 
republics 
the new parliament will choose a president and it is expected to 
elect havel parliaments chief task during its twoyear term is to 
rewrite the constitution 
that will mean dealing with rising separatist sentiment in 
slovakia where many would like to see a looser alliance replace the 
federation of czech and slovak republics set up by the communists in 
1968 
the first of the 112 million registered voters to cast their 
ballots were the coal miners of ostrava a mining and industrial 
center on the polish border long known as a bastion of stalinism 
their polling stations opened two hours ahead of the 2 pm 8 
am edt start of voting so their mining shifts would not be 
disrupted 
polls close at 2 pm saturday with initial returns expected 
later in the afternoon final results are not expected until sunday 
civic forum the movement founded by havel to lead last winters 
revolution and its slovak partner public against violence were 
heavily favored to emerge strongest from the voting 
civic forum will do well im sure said havels spokesman 
michael zantovsky after voting in a prague suburb 
echoing the latest preelection opinon polls zantovsky predicted 
that civic forum would get about 40 percent of the vote with the 
alliance of christian democrats polling about 20 percent nationwide 
but doing better in rural slovakia 
asked about the communists zantovsky made a thumbsdown gesture 
less than 10 percent he said 
all the 21 parties contesting the election alongside the 
communists campaigned on a heavily anticommunist platform 
the fairly subdued campaign turned acrimonious and even violent 
in its final week a bomb planted by unknown terrorists injured 19 
people in prague on saturday 
on wednesday a fierce row broke out between the civic forum and 
the christian democrats over the alleged links of a top christian 
democrat josef bartoncik with the hated communist secret police 
both the civic forum and the christian democrats have said a 
coalition with the communists is unlikely after the election but 
former or reformed communists who have worked in the interim 
government of national understanding forged by the revolution 
may keep their posts 
havel 53 who before last winters revolution was a reluctant 
candidate for office has clearly grown into his post and enjoyed 
both guiding his country toward democracy and helping to reshape the 
order of a changing europe 
i liked him as a dissident and i like him even more as a 
president said havels neighbor zdenek zadnik 64 one of the 
crowd waiting to see havel vote 
during the voting authorities banned the sale of alcohol except 
beer and posted police at public places from polling stations to 
post offices 
for young people who had never voted and older citizens who 
thought democracy had vanished in the 1930s with the nazis and again 
in 1948 with the communist takeover the balloting was a dream come 
true 
i didnt hope to see free elections again said milena 
jirotova 68 
its a new feeling said katrina hauffova 20 the old 
communist order seemed unchanging she added i couldnt 
imagine anything like this elections always seemed so controlled 
asked what outcome shed like to see she smiled and said five 
percent for the communists

educators on friday praised as perestroika 
or criticized as detrimental a proposal to deregulate public 
education and allow students to use taxfunded scholarships to 
attend the school of their choice 
american education is about as effective as russian agriculture 
and it operates in much the same way what they are doing is 
redefining public education said michael guerra of the national 
catholic educational association 
guerra was referring to a brookings institution study that has 
heightened an already intense debate over how much control parents 
should have in selecting schools for their children 
authors john chubb a senior fellow at brookings and stanford 
university political scientist terry moe studied various education 
reform programs declared them unsuccessful and called for an end to 
government operation of schools in favor of an entirely new system 
based on free enterprise schools would compete for students in the 
openmarket by providing genuine educational choices for parents and 
children 
chubb and moe said their recommendations result from a 10year 
nationwide study of american high schools considered the largest of 
its kind ever conducted they studied academic achievement using 
surveys of more than 20000 principals teachers and students at 
some 500 high schools nationwide 
under the chubbmoe plan each school would determine its own 
governing structure and the state could not dictate a schools 
internal organization a community office of choice would 
dispense funds while a center for parental information would 
counsel parents 
what they are proposing involves radical change they are 
talking about perestroika for american education said guerra 
using the term referring to reforms in the soviet union 
while the idea is being billed as radical even revolutionary 
myron lieberman noted that a similar idea was espoused in 1962 by 
economist milton friedman and in his own book published last year 
the major weakness is in singling out the marketplace as 
the answer said lieberman there is more than one feasible way 
of applying a market system to education he added pointing to 
the idea of allowing schools to contract out various areas of 
instruction 
walter cooper a regent of the university of the state of new 
york said the authors may be overrating the potential for the 
entrepreneurial spirit 
gary watts of the national education association called the 
proposal impractical thomas shannon executive director of the 
national school boards association predicted government would 
expand given the huge amounts of public money involved and the 
natural proclivity of legislators to regulate all within an 
emotionally charged environment when dealing with citizens 
children their rights and their tax money 
albert shanker president of the american federation of teachers 
agreed with the authors that the present governance structure of 
public education forces schools to respond to or protect the myriad 
interests of diverse pressure groups 
its no surprise that the result is excessive bureaucratization 
and educational gridlock he said required to do just about 
everything schools often find themselves unable to do anything very 
well 
but shanker said the authors never consider the possibility of 
changing the legal functions or roles of school boards so they do 
not produce bureaucratic paralysis and they dont look at the 
possibility of moving school control to some other level of 
government where schools might not be subject to the same pressures 
they now face 
theres a lot to commend said shanker but to think that 
if we only changed the governance structure of education to a market 
model or anything else for that matter wed solve the problems 
in our schools is a fantasy

a judge friday ordered dr jack kevorkian 
to stop using his suicide machine until prosecutors decide whether 
to try him for letting an alzheimers patient use the device 
oakland county circuit judge alice gilbert also enjoined the 
62yearold retired pathologist from helping people use any other 
means to kill themselves the temporary orders are effective 
statewide assistant prosecutor michael modelski said 
kevorkian who acted as his own attorney had asked the judge to 
allow him to set up a team of untouchables to help terminally 
ill people end their lives 
on monday kevorkian assisted in the suicide of janet adkins a 
54yearold portland ore woman who had been diagnosed as being in 
the early stages of alzheimers disease 
modelski said there were no immediate plans to prosecute 
kevorkian but an investigation was continuing 
kevorkian had asked the judge for a partial injunction instead 
of the full stop order sought by prosecutors to allow use of his 
machine in a specific set of circumstances 
he said he wanted time to set up a committee of specialists to 
establish a permanent planned death policy for when to use the 
machine he said he also wanted to set up an obitorium a clinic 
for the terminally ill who want medical help with suicide 
let me put together a small team called the untouchables 
kevorkian told a mediapacked courtroom i guarantee under my 
supervision it would be incorruptible 
modelski questioned the judgment of kevorkians suggested clinic 
involving a person who is physically well but mentally ill 
its got to be a medical decision ive had many healthy people 
call me begging to get them out of their misery kevorkian said 
adding the clinic would focus on people with incurable diseases 
kevorkian created an intravenous device that he hooked up to mrs 
adkins at her request it allowed her to press a button that fed 
coma and deathinducing drugs into her bloodstream 
the county prosecutor state police and state medical association 
are investigating although michigan has no specific law against 
suicide or assisting in it 
if my medical license is revoked i will build another one and 
still help patients but not as a physician kevorkian said in 
court 
kevorkian said his colleagues have been in the dark ages in 
opposing doctorassisted suicide 
im sure if they could they would burn me at the stake 
kevorkian testified often glancing around the courtroom at 
reporters 
kevorkians sister flora holzheimer of frankfurt west germany 
testified that she drove mrs adkins to the oakland county park 
where she committed suicide 
holzheimer spent saturday evening before the suicide with her 
brother mrs adkins and mrs adkins husband ronald 
each time her health faltered she died a thousand deaths 
holzheimer said of mrs adkins someone said to her janet 
youre just getting there before us she said i know and 
smiled 
also subpoenaed for fridays hearing was another sister of 
kevorkians margo janus of troy who reportedly was present during 
the suicide in the back of the doctors volkswagen van 
a survey published friday found wide support for medically 
assisted suicide for the terminally ill twothirds of 724 adults 
surveyed this week by telephone believed medical facilities should 
be available to help the terminally ill end their lives 
the usa today poll with a sampling error of plus or minus 35 
percentage points also found 28 percent feel kevorkian should be 
prosecuted and 43 percent said he shouldnt be punished for helping 
mrs adkins

a court on friday convicted a london man of 
conspiracy in an ira bombing campaign in britain and sentenced him 
to 30 years in prison 
nicholas mullen was charged in connection with one of the biggest 
caches of terrorist equipment ever found in britain the stockpile 
of arms and explosives was discovered in london in 1988 
justice anthony hidden said mullen 42 was a very dangerous 
man 
you combine a high degree of criminal cunning with a commitment 
to a particular cause that cause deals not with arguments but with 
atrocities hidden said 
the old bailey central criminal court jury deliberated 12 hours 
before finding mullen guilty of conspiracy to cause bombings for his 
part in the irish republican armys 1988 bombing campaign 
eamon wadley 36 also on trial for terrorist offenses was 
cleared of all charges 
police accidentally discovered the arms and explosives stockpile 
in south london in december 1988 after a man was shot in the stomach 
in a disturbance on the street in front of an apartment complex 
the gunman ran into the complex and a search of the area found 
an apartment filled with terrorist equipment including nearly 200 
pounds of czechoslovakmade semtex explosive an unspecified number 
of machine guns and other firearms rifles handguns and 
bombmaking equipment 
during the sixweek trial the jury heard how mullen helped the 
ira by renting apartments buying used cars and obtaining false 
identities for the guerillas 
however the old bailey jury found wadley innocent of aiding 
terrorists and he was acquitted of four charges of making property 
available for use in connection with terrorism 
prosecutor john nutting called the south london apartment one 
of biggest caches of terrorist equipment ever found in this 
country 
the prosecutor said that if the plot had not been unexpectedly 
foiled the iras campaign would certainly have led to the death 
or injury of many people 
the ira is waging a bloody fight to drive the british out of the 
predominantly protestant province of northern ireland and unite it 
with the roman catholic irish republic

president bush said friday he is considering 
breaking off talks with the palestine liberation organization after 
the sheer terror of a thwarted palestinian attack on an israeli 
beach 
in washington a senior administration official said he expected 
a 30day suspension of the talks though he said no final decision 
had been made and outright termination of contacts also was possible 
bush called on plo leader yasser arafat to publicly renounce the 
attack and suggested the continuation of usplo contacts depended 
on arafats response 
our dialogue is predicated on a renunciation of terror in my 
view this was sheer terror bush said 
asked if as several news reports have suggested he were 
considering breaking off the talks begun in december 1988 bush said 
we are discussing all of that no decision has been made im 
not prepared to make an announcement on policy at this point 
 
 
in his first public comments on the matter bush criticized 
arafat for refusing to condemn last weeks attack on the israeli 
coastline by the palestine liberation front one the plos 
constituent groups arafat has said the plo was not involved in the 
attack but has not condemned it outright 
israeli forces intercepted two speedboats filled with palestinian 
fighters near tel aviv four of the palestinians were killed and 12 
captured the attack followed the slaying 10 days earlier of seven 
palestinian laborers by an israeli the government described as 
deranged 
bush commented aboard air force one as he neared the end of a 
political fundraising trip to midwestern states 
shortly before he spoke secretary of state james a baker iii 
in scotland for a nato meeting said the attempted raid has to be 
taken very seriously but he also said that some perspective and 
responsibility is required in dealing with the issue and that the 
bush administration was seeking more information before deciding on 
possible action 
in washington an administration official said the united states 
has held at least four meetings with plo representatives since the 
raid to discuss the organizations views on it the official 
speaking only on condition of anonymity said no decision on 
breaking off talks was likely for a number of days 
another senior official said he expects the administration to 
suspend the dialogue with the plo for about 30 days but he did not 
rule out outright termination if the administration concludes that 
such a message to the plo is necessary he too said no decision 
had been made 
earlier diplomatic sources in washington said the united states 
would announce suspension of the talks next week the sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity said the administration would 
cite the attack and the plos decision not to condemn the action 
bush said the attempted attack was horrendous 
there was no rationale for it other than in my view terror 
he said 
bush said that he had discussed the middle east peace process 
earlier in the day in a telephone conversation with egyptian 
president hosni mubarak both of us are still committed to getting 
the peace talks going forward he sid 
ive expressed my outrage about the attack last week he 
said maybe i can take this opportunity to express my outrage 
about all the violence in the middle east 
he expressed some pessimism about the progress of peace efforts 
every time you get something started there seems to be some 
outbreak bush said 
im still outraged by the holding of us hostages i have this 
on my mind all the time all of those things have a way of coming 
together 
on efforts by yitzhak shamir the caretaker prime minister of 
israel to form a rightwing government bush said it was an 
internal matter for israel 
ill work with whomever that country puts forth as its 
government he said 
asked if such a government would hamper peace efforts bush said 
that israel knows the policy of the united states in wanting to 
get peace talks going between israel and the palestinians 
the world is crying out for negotiations on this question he 
said

the ames department stores inc trying to 
jettison unprofitable operations announced plans friday to close 
221 stores and lay off about 17500 employees as it struggles to 
emerge from bankruptcy protection 
the closings which represent nearly a third of ames 679 stores 
nationwide must be approved by the us bankruptcy court in new 
york where the nations fourth largest retailer filed for 
protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankrutpcy laws on april 25 
this is a critical first step towards our primary goal of 
leading ames out of chapter 11 said stephen l pistner the new 
chief executive officer brought in by ames to steer it through its 
current troubles 
the 221 stores being closed include 33 stores ames previously 
said it would close and 184 former zayre stores analysts have said 
ames acquisition two years ago of the zayre chain led to ames 
downfall 
most of the stores being closed are in illinois indiana ohio 
north carolina and florida 
this downsizing will cut our expenses reduce operating losses 
and allow us to focus our efforts on serving our customers 
pistner said 
the 458 stores staying open are mostly in the northeast the 
company employed about 55000 people at the time of the bankruptcy 
filing 
ames also plans to close distribution centers in plant city 
fla and worcester mass the retailer plans to complete 
construction of a distribution center in leesport pa in early 
1991 subject to court approval 
ames hopes to realize 180 million in cash from liquidation sales 
this summer 
the stores being closed lost about 48 million last year pistner 
said 
ames which reported losses of 228 million last year has 
attributed its troubles to the sluggish retail market in the 
northeast and to problems with its 1988 acquisition of the 392store 
zayre chain 
the 788 million acquisition doubled ames size and transformed 
the company from a littleknown new englandbased chain into the 
nations fourthlargest discounter it has since closed 90 of those 
stores and converted others to the ames name

some practitioners of euthanasia 
on friday defended mercy killing but criticized the inventor of a 
suicide machine that an oregon woman used this week to kill herself 
the case was discussed here friday on the second day of the world 
conference of the international federation of righttodie societies 
the 21nation gathering of physicians lawyers and righttodie 
activists was called to consider legal ethical and psychological 
aspects of the right to die 
janet adkins of portland ore died monday after using the 
suicide machine designed by dr jack kevorkian of michigan she had 
been told she was suffering from alzheimers disease 
a judge in michigan on friday ordered kevorkian to stop using the 
machine until prosecutors decide whether to file chargers in 
connection with the adkins case 
herbert cohen a dutch general practitioner also known for his 
willingness to perform mercy killing said kevorkian had used the 
device just so he could run away from the moral repercussions of 
the womans death 
kevorkians machine makes use of a buttonoperated intravenous 
drip 
such a machine is no expression of compassion tenderness or 
care cohen said 
dr piet admiraal one of two dutch physicians who have 
spearheaded a 15year campaign for the full legalization of 
euthanasia here said he had been approached by kevorkian about use 
of the machine but rebuffed him 
i tried to explain to him time and again we dont need such a 
machine here admiraal said i prefer to simply inject the 
lethal drugs myself and if the patient prefers to do it we give 
him a euthanasia drink 
in an address to the conference on friday cohen made no direct 
reference to the adkins case but he urged his colleagues to take 
the time to sit down hold hands with patients who ask to die 
you cannot discuss euthanasia standing at the foot of the 
bed in a white coat mumbling latin incantations cohen told his 
audience 
dutch legal and medical authorities widely approve of the 
principle that patients be allowed to opt for death when they face 
pointless suffering or terminal illness 
however mercy killing is still technically on dutch law books as 
a crime carrying a 12year maximum prison term

a west german salesman who provided two east german 
agents with commercially available items including dictionaries and 
brochures was convicted friday of spying for a foreign power 
a special court sentenced klaus tscheu who has lived in france 
since 1966 to four years in prison with 18 months suspended the 
sevenjudge panel acquitted a codefendant francoise drouillaut 
during the twoday trial tscheu 51 said all he furnished to 
two east german agents during contacts from may 1982 to may 1983 
were items available commercially such as a francogerman 
dictionary of computer terms he bought in a book store and leaflets 
on office equipment 
he said he was paid about 2550 for his services 
tscheu told the court he ended his contacts after a fourth 
meeting in east berlin he was arrested by french secret agents a 
few weeks later 
tscheu became involved with the german agents after placing an ad 
in a west german newspaper offering to act as a commercial 
representative in france he said his own commercial ventures such 
as selling greek carpets had been unsuccessful and he was in need 
of a job 
when he first met the agents identified as michael neubus and 
peter they said he could represent them in france selling 
porcelain and shirts however tscheu admitted in court that the men 
appeared a little strange 
in three meetings in east berlin they asked him to supply 
seemingly banal information such as details on modern office 
equipment a civil aviation map and a francogerman technical 
dictionary 
tscheu told the court the material he provided was all available 
commercially 
i was arrested tscheu said in testimony thursday but im 
not a spy and i never was i was afraid 
french agents were alerted by the husband of ms drouillaut who 
was tscheus mistress they began investigating tscheu and arrested 
him within weeks of his last trip to east berlin 
ms drouillauts husband a navigating engineer at a flight test 
center became suspicious after she began asking him a series of 
questions the questions came after tscheus contacts requested 
technical information on the aviation industry 
the husband allegedly wrote an anonymous letter to the local 
gendarmerie denouncing tscheu as a spy

greyhound union president edward m strait 
called friday for a bankruptcy judge to oust the companys 
management and approve an employee takeover plan to save the 
nations only nationwide bus line 
i think the only salvation right now is an employee stock 
ownership plan and thats what were pursuing said strait who 
represents greyhounds 6300 union drivers who walked out march 2 
in a wage and job security dispute 
strait in his first detailed response to greyhounds filing for 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this week said in an 
interview that the amalgamated council of greyhound local unions 
wants to work with the bus lines creditors toward implementing an 
employee stock ownership plan 
any such plan would first require a bankruptcy judges removal of 
current greyhound chairman fred currey and the appointment of a 
trustee strait said 
union drivers could then resume work under their old contract and 
help the company become profitable again possibly with thirdparty 
investors and pay off debts strait said the union would 
gradually gain an increased amount of control of the companys 
operations he said 
the only other way to save the company strait said is for 
greyhound to return to the bargaining table and seek a contract with 
union drivers for an end to the threemonthold strike 
those are not the only two ways countered greyhound 
spokesman george gravley noting the company filed chapter 11 so it 
could reorganize its finances and continue operating 
the company was forced into bankruptcy gravley said because of 
strike violence that cost the company close to 50 million 
there were dozens of shootings and bomb threats early in the 
strike as well as violence on the picket line a striking driver 
was crushed to death in redding calif by a bus driven by a 
replacement driver 
what we are faced with is this onetime charge that is directly 
attributable to the violence of the strike that overwhelmed our 
financial system when it occurred all at once gravley said 
if this had been a lawful peaceful strike we would not be in 
chapter 11 right now he claimed 
strait noted there have not been any acts of violence in more 
than a month 
the violence seemed to end when the company got rid of all 
their ninja security guards they traveled in these black vans they 
had these uniforms tucked into boots if that isnt planned to 
initiate something i dont know what is strait said 
instead strait claimed the turning point that brought 
greyhound to bankruptcy was a national labor relations board 
complaint alleging that greyhounds unfair labor practices caused 
the walkout 
the complaint formally filed last week was crucial because it 
prompted concern among creditors since it opens greyhound up to 
possibly 10 million a month in back pay strait said 
gravley said greyhound could easily continue operating once it 
reorganizes its finances 
there is a strong demand for our service he said this is 
not a sunset business that is disappearing because no one wants to 
buy from us

a judge friday cleared the way for a 31yearold 
quadriplegic to end his life after hearing the disabled mans ailing 
father testify his son wants to die before him 
state district judge donald mosley granted a petition sought by 
kenneth a bergstedt that would allow a doctor to give bergstedt a 
sedative and disconnect him from the respirator that he needs to 
help him breathe 
he wants to go before i do bergstedts 65yearold father 
robert testified theres no future for him he knows hell never 
walk again he knows he has to depend on someone else the rest of 
his life 
but mosley ordered the state attorney generals office to appeal 
to the nevada supreme court and cautioned the elder bergstedt 
against acting too hastily this merely allows you the option 
mosley said 
mosley ordered an expedited appeal so the supreme court could set 
a precedent nevada has no laws governing such cases 
one district court judges opinion does not put this to rest 
mosley said for the residents of the state of nevada and for 
kenneth bergstedt a definitive resolution needs to be had 
the request for the order was not opposed by deputy attorney 
general donald haight who said he based his opinion on bergstedt 
having a constitutional right to privacy 
bergstedt who did not attend the hearing has been paralyzed 
from age 10 since his neck was broken when a girl jumped into a pool 
on him while he was swimming 
the elder bergstedt said his son has wanted to end his life for 
17 years ever since he came to the realization he had no hope of 
recovering from injuries that shattered any chances of leading a 
normal life 
he sees all these things are denied him that a normal man would 
do he said when he had it for three or four years he started 
realizing there was no cure he expressed then his desire to die 
bergstedt said his son decided to seek a court order allowing him 
to die after hearing of a similar case about 18 months ago in 
california 
he said his son who spends most of his time on a gurney and 
cannot feed himself or handle any of his bodily functions sees no 
reason to continue living 
im not overjoyed with it he said of his sons desire to 
die but i do consent with what hes doing i can see why hes 
doing it 
he has cared for his son on a 24hour basis since his wife died 
in november 1978 and he said his son fears being put in an 
institution when he dies 
the elder bergstedt has one leg suffers from high blood pressure 
and said he recently had a spot discovered on a lung 
it would probably be very difficult for him to adjust to a 
bunch of different people caring for him bergstedt said

perestroika has brought the soviet union baseball 
big macs and now a barbershop quartet and that countrys first such 
troupe harmonized here friday to american classics like 
chattanooga choochoo 
the quiet don quartet wearing western europeanstyled suits 
pleased a small crowd at the faneuil hall marketplace with familiar 
melodies and lighthearted showmanship 
its not very known in russia but wherever we go people love 
it said yuri ivanovich vasilief the smiling tenor in the group 
through a translator 
the people in the soviet union are usually very surprised 
and people from the audience like barbershop style said the 
groups bass oleg nikolaevich kovalenko evgeni garreivich feldman 
is the groups lead vocalist and sergei alexandrovich tarakanov 
sings baritone 
vasilief 55 said the quartet first heard barbershop singing a 
popular american tradition of simple easytosing melodies in 
fourpart harmony at a music conference in east germany in 1987 
the group was visiting with their chamber choir from the soviet 
institute of music in rostov 
friday the singers smiled and gestured with their hands as they 
performed several songs including toot toot tootsie goodbye 
and side by side 
the quartet members spoke little or no english but sang the 
songs in english 
it is not difficult to learn the songs because they are very 
interesting vasilief said 
the quartet arrived from the soviet union a week ago to perform 
with a barbershop group called the big apple chorus in new york 
city said george obrien a representative of the southshore 
mass men of harmony which brought the troupe to boston 
this was the first stop in a tencity tour for quiet don quartet 
whose name is taken from the lazy flowing don river in the 
soviet union vasilief said 
i think this trip is one of many new bridges of communication 
between the two countries vasilief said noting soviet union 
president mikhail gorbachevs restructuring plans and opendoor 
policy with the united states 
kovalenko said the group received several letters and finally an 
invitation from a los angeles troupe the 139th street quartet to 
visit the united states the los angeles group asked them to travel 
to san francisco to compete in an international barbershop quartet 
competition beginning july 3 
getting permission to make the trip wasnt a problem but the 
members couldnt afford airplane tickets said kovalenko 27 
the society for the preservation and encouragement of barber shop 
quartet singing in america inc raised about 20000 to bring the 
quartet to america obrien said 
they are going back to russia to form other barbershop choral

the staunchest public defender 
of the irish republican army said friday the ira killing of a 
reserve police officer and his wife this week was wrong 
you dont expect me to say that it was a good operation when it 
patently was not said gerry adams the president of sinn fein 
the iras political wing 
last week adams criticized the mistaken killing of two 
australian tourists in the dutch town of roermond on may 27 as 
inexcusable and unjustifiable 
however adams also told reporters in london earlier this week 
that he regards the ira as freedom fighters on friday he said 
the killing of soldiers is justified 
the ira says it aims to end british rule in northern ireland and 
unite the mostly protestant province with the overwhelmingly roman 
catholic republic of ireland 
within two weeks it has killed six people attorneys stephen 
melrose and nicholas spanos in roermond british army pvt william 
robert davies 19 on june 1 in lichfield british army maj michael 
john dillonlee 34 in dortmund west germany and retired reserve 
officer james sefton 65 and ellen sefton 66 in belfast 
the seftons were killed wednesday by a bomb planted in their car 
what happened to those two old people was totally wrong 
adams said on thursday he reiterated that friday saying it was 
wrong that is my position 
meeting with journalists friday adams said it was not ira policy 
to attack retired police officers 
other recent ira mistakes included the killing of heidi 
hazell 26yearold german wife of a british soldier in september 
the slaying of the 6monthold daughter of a british soldier in 
germany the following month and the death of 16yearold terry 
love killed by debris from an ira bomb while watching a parade in 
londonderry in january 
some sinn fein activists have blamed such operations for the 
decline in the partys vote in national elections from a high of 
134 percent in 1983 to 114 percent in 1987 
adams was in london this week to promote his latest book cage 
eleven about his experiences in prison questions however 
inevitably focused on the killings in roermond lichfield and 
dortmund 
i have been very critical of the ira i have made my criticisms 
known in a principled way where it matters in republican circles as 
well as the mass media adams said there can be no doubt where 
sinn fein stands on actions which lead to the deaths of civilians or 
injuries to civilians 
but he did not criticize the killing of soldiers 
i dont want to see anyone killed much less a 19yearold 
soldier an australian citizen or an irish citizens but there is a 
conflict he said there is a war going on people join armies 
to fight

new findings have thrown cold water on 
cold fusion experiments at several laboratories but researchers 
at the national cold fusion institute here remain undeterred 
researchers at two texas aampm university labs and at the los 
alamos national laboratory in new mexico have conceded that the 
palladium rods used in their cold fusion experiments were 
contaminated with tritium 
tritium is a byproduct of fusion the bonding together of atomic 
nuclei to create energy the researchers now believe that what they 
took to be evidence of fusion was actually contamination 
ronald parker director of the plasma fusion center at the 
massachusetts institute of technology said skeptical scientists 
long have speculated that contamination might be responsible for the 
evidence of tritium in such experiments 
the thing that does astonish me is that something this wasnt 
detected earlier he said tritium is the thing that would still 
pique the interest of many scientists now that there seems to be a 
logical explanation maybe it is the last nail 
but a spokesman for the utah institute said friday that it used 
palladium rods from a different source than the other labs and they 
are believed to have been uncontaminated 
my impression is that people would be welladvised to analyze 
thoroughly the palladium theyve used in their experiments 
institute director fritz will said 
nuclear fusion is usually accomplished at extremely high 
temperatures and is a costly process cold fusion would be highly 
attractive because it would be a cheap and virtually inexhaustible 
energy source 
the cold fusion experiments were first reported by utah 
electrochemist b stanley pons and british colleague martin 
fleischmann they involved a palladium electrode wrapped in platinum 
wire then immersed in deuterium oxide also called heavy water 
in a march 29 1989 announcement that sparked a furor pons and 
fleischmann said that when they applied electricity to the 
roomtemperature device more energy was released in the form of 
heat than they put into it 
the pair have said the cells also produced tritium a product of 
fusion although they have not published any scientific reports 
explaining their findings nor have they or other researchers 
pinpointed the reason for the excess heat 
will who joined the statefunded institute in february said he 
could not speak for pons and fleischmann who conduct separate 
experiments in their chemistry department laboratories in addition 
to those at the institute 
telephone messages to pons went unanswered 
but will said that most if not all of the palladium rods used 
at the institute were purchased from johnson mathey a british 
scientific supplier and that specifications called for them to be 
9999 percent pure 
the wall street journal reported thursday that kevin wolf a 
physicist at texas aampm universitys cyclotron laboratory had 
conceded that the palladium rods used in his experiments might have 
been contaminated 
wolf said the rods were purchased from hoover amp strong a metals 
processor in richmond va an official there said the company 
refines and processes palladium primarily for the jewelry trade and 
thus isnt as concerned about purity as scientists might be 
wolf was not immediately available for comment 
palladium from the same company was used in cold fusion 
experiments at a chemistry lab at texas aampm and at los alamos

president mikhail s gorbachev said friday he 
envisages a new relationship between the nato and warsaw pact 
alliances and the establishment of an alleuropean security body 
but after more than four hours of talks with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher gorbachev said he remained opposed to a 
united germany as a member of the north atlantic treaty organization 
we believe there is a chance for the formation of a new type of 
relationship between the two alliances as they go through a 
transforming process while overcoming military confrontation in 
europe gorbachev said 
at a news conference with mrs thatcher gorbachev added that if 
the 16nation nato alliance agreed at a summit in london next month 
to adopt a political role an alleuropean system of security 
could follow 
during the hourlong news conference it was clear that mrs 
thatcher did not change gorbachevs mind about the military future 
of germany a key dispute unsolved at last weeks superpower summit 
in washington 
gorbachev also suggested the soviets want a matching response 
from nato to the decision by the sevennation warsaw pact at a 
summit here on thursday to become a purely political and 
consultative organization by november 
the warsaw pact is however regarded as a dying military 
alliance incapable of mounting any joint offensive operation because 
of the fall of communist governments in six of the member states 
i think that what happened yesterday testifies about deep 
changes in the essence of the warsaw pact organization said 
gorbachev 
if the processes go in such a direction at the nato meeting in 
july this will open the possibility for some agreement in 
favor of an alleuropean system of security he said 
mrs thatcher disagreed saying for the time being we should 
continue to work through the existing organizations 
but she also said that no country is more entitled to 
assurance and reassurance about the future of germany than the 
soviet union 
the prospect of a united germany has revived memories in the 
soviet union of the devastating german invasion during world war ii 
that left millions dead 
at the news conference gorbachev said the nato and warsaw pact 
military alliances cannot ignore the political cooperation that has 
developed between east and western europe in recent years 
one can have a policy that will resemble an elephant in a china 
store one move to the left smashes half of the store a move to the 
right smashes the other half he said if this is the policy we 
choose i dont envy us 
he said he was sure a solution would be found to the german 
issue 
in the talks mrs thatcher and gorbachev discussed among other 
things a ninepoint us plan aimed at overcoming soviet concerns 
about germany in nato it includes proposals for keeping soivet 
troops in what is now east germany during a transitional period 
mrs thatcher who is on a fourday visit to the soviet union 
was to leave moscow on saturday to tour a british exhibition in the 
ukrainian capital kiev on sunday she goes to armenias second 
city leninakan hit by an earthquake 18 months ago

the national airline klm will begin 
grounding pregnant stewardesses this fall because of a us report 
saying crews may be exposed to harmful levels of radiation a 
company spokesman said friday 
the study by the us transportation department released in 
february estimates the lifetime cancer risk due to cosmic radiation 
for airline crew members who fly 960 hours annually would be from 
five to 61 deaths for every 100000 individuals in 20 years of 
flying 
it also notes some risk to frequent fliers and to the fetuses of 
pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy 
we were planning on making some changes anyway but the 
reports of possible dangers related to higher radiation levels made 
us act faster klm spokesman hugo baas said 
scientists and us officials caution that the risk data was not 
based on any study of actual cancer cases but on mathematical models 
projecting the effects of lowlevel radiation from the sun and stars 
folkert draaisma a radiobiology expert at the national 
scientific research center in rijswijk said radiation is most 
dangerous between the 8th and 15th weeks of pregnancy when fetal 
brains are formed 
i estimate that a stewardess who flies during her entire 
pregnancy will reach the unacceptable level which he indicated 
was 40 percent above the normal dose of cosmic radiation that 
everyone routinely receives 
according to the new airline regulation once a stewardess 
reports her pregnancy she must be given the option of an 
alternative job on the ground or an extended paid pregnancy leave 
union leader joop kostermans said 
kosterman heads the dutch association of cabin personnel which 
represents 98 percent of klms 4100 flight attendants

in a move reminiscent of the baltic republics 
first steps toward secession lawmakers of the vast russian 
federation approved a draft proclamation that would give their laws 
priority over national legislation 
the russian congress led by radical reformer boris n yeltsin 
approved the article in a draft declaration of sovereignty by a 
544271 vote the tass news agency reported the final version of 
the document must still be voted on 
most laws on the books in the 15 soviet republics mirror national 
laws but sovereignty allows the republics to push ahead with 
legislation that might contradict kremlin wishes the russian 
federation is the largest and most populous of the soviet republics 
the russian federation with its capital in moscow comprises 
twothirds of the countrys territory and contains more than half 
its population 
the vote appeared to set the stage for a confrontation between 
yeltsin and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who has warned 
that the kremlin cannot carry out its reforms if the russian 
heartland is not firmly behind it 
gorbachev strongly opposed yeltsins election last month as 
president of the russian federation saying his plans could lead to 
the breakup of the country but he expressed no concern about 
fridays measure 
the russian congress has not passed anything that would 
contradict the soviet constitution he told a news conference 
after he met with prime minister margaret thatcher of britain who 
was visiting moscow 
and im sure if you ask what percent 100 percent sure that 
neither the congress of peoples deputies of russia nor the future 
supreme soviet will pass laws that would damage the development of 
the federation or complicate its reformation he said 
the russian people will not stand for being pushed to pit 
themselves against other people for breaking up the union he 
added 
the baltic republics of latvia lithuania and estonia began their 
drive for independence by proclaiming the priority of their laws 
over national laws the kremlin rejected their declarations of 
sovereignty and it has imposed a partial economic blockade against 
lithuania 
gorbachev indicated friday he would seek a reconciliation with 
yeltsin even if he continues his strong push for russian sovereignty 
what would disturb me more than anything at this stage is a 
split in the democratic forces he said implying that he viewed 
yeltsin as an ally in the reform movement 
yeltsin who has become gorbachevs political nemesis over the 
last two years has said he hopes to cooperate with gorbachev 
despite their personal and political differences but that his first 
priority is defending russias interests 
he met recently with lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis 
and promised to set up strong ties with the breakaway republic as 
soon as russia gained sovereignty 
the pledge implied he would be willing to circumvent the 
kremlins blockade against lithuania which was imposed to pressure 
the republic into suspending its march 11 declaration of indpendence 
the russian congress which convened for the first time in late 
may discussed the idea of sovereignty for hours and virtually all 
deputies supported it as a means of gaining more independence from 
centrally dictated decisions 
however there were widely varying opinions on how far 
sovereignty should go 
the measure passed friday instructed the editorial commission 
working out russias declaration of sovereignty to base its work on 
the idea that russian laws supercede national ones 
the legal sense of this is that russian laws have a certain 
priority over soviet laws said sergei gribanov of the congress 
press center but i wouldnt say this should be taken as a 
secessionist declaration 
a final draft of the declaration likely will not be ready before 
wednesday he said press center officials said they believed the 
draft would require a twothirds majority in the 1060member 
russian congress 
the brief tass report from the congress said the declaration 
proclaims the priority of the constitution of the russian 
federation and laws of the russian federation on the entire 
territory of the republic it would suspend any laws of the soviet 
union that contradict the republics laws

a former us army sergeant with a brilliant 
criminal mind has admitted selling secret nato plans for the 
nuclear defense of europe that were passed to the soviet union an 
fbi agent testified friday 
its one of the most serious breaches ever its unprecedented 
what went over to the other side said joe navarro who led the 
fbis investigation the ability to defend ourselves is 
neutralized because they have all our plans 
roderick james ramsay 28 made his initial court appearance 
friday on the charge of conspiracy to gather or deliver defense 
information to aid a foreign government us magistrate elizabeth 
jenkins ordered him held until a bond hearing tuesday 
ramsays attorney mark pizzo did not enter any plea on his 
clients behalf ramsay faces a maximum penalty of life imprisonment 
if convicted of espionage conspiracy 
ramsay was arrested thursday night on a downtown street following 
a twoyear investigation 
the fbi said ramsay worked in west germany from 1983 to 1985 
directly under clyde lee conrad 43 a retired us army sergeant 
convicted of treason by a west german court and given a life 
sentence earlier this week 
when the fbi began collecting information on conrad in mid1988 
agents conducted the first of some 40 interviews with the 
cooperative ramsay authorities said 
ramsay has acknowledged that he was in fact recruited by conrad 
in midtolate 1983 and participated in espionage activity with 
him navarro testified 
ramsay had a high iq speaks fluent japanese spanish and german 
and has the ability to recall minute details facts and figures from 
hundreds of volumes of documents navarro testified 
those included sensitive documents on the use of tactical nuclear 
weapons by us forces and nato allies and plans for the defense of 
central europe the justice department said ramsay also leaked 
technical manuals on military communications technology and material 
about the coordination of nato forces 
he had the unique privilege of being posted where a lot of 
highly sensitive information came through his hands navarro said 
he mentioned other examples such as the sites of nuclear storage 
areas and contingency plans in the event of a nuclear attack by the 
soviet bloc or a third world nation 
the material was passed to hungarian and czechoslovakian agents 
and eventually fell into the hands of the soviet kgb according to 
fbi and justice department officials 
it involves an extensive amount of information provided to the 
soviet intelligence service through eastern european surrogates 
said justice spokesman doug tillett in washington 
navarro testified that ramsay began by photographing documents 
and later discovered he could record more information with a video 
recorder in december 1985 the agent said ramsay spent a week 
recording some 45 hours of documents he had either stolen or copied 
although ramsay told the fbi he received only 20000 for his 
efforts navarro estimated the east bloc agents paid between 22 
million and 5 million for the information from the ring 
authorities believe some of the money is stashed in foreign bank 
accounts said law enforcement sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity investigators are trying to trace the money 
conrad controlled the money and ramsay wanted very much to obtain 
it especially since recent financial problems forced him to live at 
his mothers home in tampa or sleep in his car navarro said 
fbi agents would not discuss why they investigated ramsay and 
kept him under surveillance for two years before making an arrest 
but navarro said agents hoped his cooperation would lead to other 
suspects 
ramsays last known contact with conrad came in january 1986 in 
boston when his former boss gave him a small cow bell and told him 
that anyone displaying a similar bell was involved in the spy ring 
the agent testified 
while the fbi has no evidence that ramsay participated in 
espionage since 1986 his vast knowlege of nato secrets made him a 
highly marketable commodity to hostile governments navarro said 
during the investigation agents learned ramsay had stashed top 
secret documents at his mothers house and later destroyed them 
navarro said the agent added that ramsay still claims to have a 
tape with highly sensitive defense information 
agents searched the home and ramsays car following his arrest 
but have not revealed what was found 
the fbi agent described the mustachioed bespectacled suspect as 
having a criminal mind and no remorse for his actions 
before joining the army ramsay is believed to have participated 
in a 1981 bank robbery in vermont and then fled to hawaii navarro 
said 
he added that ramsay said he tried every drug under the sun 
and in fact was forced out of the army in 1985 after traces of 
hashish showed up in a urine test 
ramsay was a man who had no fear of going to jail telling fbi 
agents as recently as a month ago he would be able to read get a 
law degree and obtain a criminal education navarro said 
look out when i get out navarro quoted ramsay as saying 
because im going to be an educated criminal

three whistles is an sos or ranger alert he said at the 
outset of the tour his first in the park since he quit his parks 
department job last month in a dispute with the new commissioner 
parks spokesman skip garrett said the department would not take

walkingdining tours of city parks encouraging people to sample the 
edible flora growing wild 
parks officials had him arrested in 1986 but reached an 
agreement for him to continue the tours as a city employee 
but new commissioner betsy gotbaum complained brill didnt want 
to punch a time clock or report to an office and that he was 
encouraging people to take things out of the park she also said it 
could be unhealthy to eat things picked from the parks given the 
number of dogs who relieve themselves there 
brill quit on may 29 rather than accept the new rules he said 
the group from the riveredge nature center in newburg wis had 
arranged their tour with brill last year and decided to stick with 
the plan despite his changed status

patton sent the signed letter in 1944 to gen charles summerall 
a former army chief of staff who was one of his teachers at west

that they would attack removed the nervous tension he wrote it 
is really amazing what the determination on the part of one man can 
do to many thousands 
the letter was sold thursday by herman darvick autograph auctions 
to an anonymous private new jersey collector the letter was one of 
seven patton letters sold at the auction for a total of 50325

experiments are conducted on materials that may be used in nuclear 
weapons said lab spokesman john webster 
tritium is a manmade radioactive isotope of hydrogen 
the exposure dose cannot be definitely determined until the time 
of exposure is known but the dose hypothetically could be as much 
as 32 rem the lab said 
a rem is the unit of measurement used to describe the biological

an independent survey has concluded that the 
usgovernment sponsored television station sending test broadcast 
which broadcasts to cuba is reaching at least occasionally about 
28 per cent of the households in western cuba officials said friday 
tony navarro who directs the tv marti operation said the survey 
repudiates cuban claims that extensive jamming has been virtually 
100 per cent successful in keeping the stations news and 
entertainment shows from reaching cuban households 
tv marti has been testing since march 27 sometime this summer 
president bush is expected to make a determination as to whether the 
broadcasts should become permanent 
the survey was taken of 543 cubans who have arrived in the united 
states since testing began navarro said in an interview that the 
results clearly indicate that tv marti is a worthwhile project that 
should be continued despite the jamming effort 
the sampling which was performed by a new york firm was limited 
to cubans who live in the primary target area of tv marti the 
city of havana and three western provinces 
twentyeight per cent of the households in the primary target 
area appear to be able to receive tv marti at least occasionally 
navarro said 
he said the word occasionally means anywhere from five 
minutes to three hours at least twice a week 
he said the credibility of the testimony of the witnesses was 
reinforced by the fact that 57 per cent were able to recall and 
identify specific programs 
president fidel castro has called tv marti a gross instrument 
of subversion and made arrangements to block the signal from the 
first day that programming began he also has said the operation 
violates international law 
in addition to jamming tv marti cuban authorities also have 
begun blocking the signal in the havana area of radio marti a voice 
of america station that began broadcasting five years ago 
tv marti has limited testing to the predawn hours in order not 
to interfere with regular programming by cuban stations its 
supporters maintain that tv marti helps break the monopoly over news 
that the cuban government has had for 31 years and also provides the 
cuban people with more varied entertainment

a veteran fbi agent sued the agency friday 
contending it irrationally bans homosexuals from employment and 
plans to fire him because he disclosed in 1988 that he is a 
homosexual 
the agent is identified as john doe in the us district court 
suit not because he is embarrassed by his openly declared sexual 
orientation but because he has done sensitive counterintelligence 
work for the fbi and wants to resume if he wins the suit his lawyer 
said 
the fbi has a policy and practice of denying security 
clearances and employment to gay persons only because of their 
sexual orientation association with other gay people and 
speculation about their sexual conduct the suit said 
it said the policy was based on sexual orientation not conduct 
and that no such policy covered heterosexual conduct such as 
extramarital affairs 
the policy is irrational as applied to doe who has an excellent 
work record has received several special commendations and isnt 
susceptible to blackmail the suit said doe is based in san diego 
in washington fbi spokesman carlos fernandez denied that such a 
policy exists 
our concern is with sexual conduct not preference he said 
you may have even heterosexual conduct with which we may be 
concerned if it affects the job 
stressing that he was not discussing any specific case fernandez 
said the fbis policy is that homosexual conduct is considered a 
significant factor in employee hiring and retention on a 
casebycase basis 
he declined to say whether homosexual conduct is a bar to fbi 
employment or how it is evaluated 
but does lawyer richard gayer said the fbis absolute ban on 
homosexual employees was declared publicly in response to a 1979 
lawsuit that challenged the policy 
gayer said the fbi policy has been upheld in two other appellate 
circuits 
the issue in this case is whether they can simply ignore 20 
years of good service gayer said 
doe does not care who knows he is gay but never told the fbi 
until an investigation that started in december 1988 the suit said

former president jose figueres who 
guided costa rica through a revolution to democracy and then 
abolished the countrys army died friday he was 83 
he was widely credited with starting this central american nation 
of 28 million people on the road to 42 years of peace and relative 
prosperity in a region not known for stability or economic success 
figueres died at his home outside san jose presidential 
spokeswoman ana lorena vargas said the medical report said he died 
of natural causes a family spokesman said he had been in poor 
health in recent years 
his body will remain at his home friday night and lie in state at 
the national museum beginning saturday morning a statement from the 
family said 
funeral services were scheduled for tuesday at the national 
cathedral with burial at his ranch in san marcos de tarrazu 50 
miles from san jose 
president rafael angel calderon guardia called a threeday 
mourning period he described figueres as one of the most valient 
men our country had who contributed enormously to the development of 
democracy in costa rica he is one of the protagonists of our 
history and one of those who contributed most to peace 
the charismatic and combative figueres known affectionately as 
don pepe took to the hills in 1948 to lead a brief but bloody 
revolt against the late president rafael angel calderon father of 
the present chief of state 
the elder calderon was a strongman who allied himself with the 
communists and was trying to return to power by canceling the 
presidential election of otilio ulate 
during an 18month interim presidency figueres abolished the 
army in 1949 and restored honest elections the new constitution 
written by his government also increased social services 
the communist party was banned but has since been legalized 
figueres later was elected to two terms serving from 195358 and 
197074 
a civil and rural guard continues to be costa ricas only defense 
in a region wracked by wars the country invested in education 
instead and has a literacy level of about 90 percent one of the 
highest in the hemisphere 
born sept 25 1906 soon after his parents arrived in costa rica 
from spain he attended the massachusetts institute of technology 
and studied hydroelectric engineering 
he established a ranch in costa rica where he carried out 
innovative agricultural and forestry projects 
even as president the 5foot3inch figueres traveled without 
bodyguards although he often carried a pistol 
a fierce anticommunist he came to sympathize with the left he 
visited cuba numerous times allowed establishment of a soviet 
embassy over widespread objections and backed the leftist 
sandinista revolution in neighboring nicaragua that overthrew 
dictator anastasio somoza in 1979 
he boasted of having worked closely with the cia in his earlier 
days but railed against us policy when the united states 
supported nicaraguas contra guerrillas 
times change and only the rivers dont return he once 
retorted to critics of contradictions in his politics 
he went against public opinion and granted fugitive american 
financier robert vesco refuge here in 1972 vesco was expelled in 
1978 
during the 1971 hijacking of a costa rican airliner figueres 
took matters into his own hands 
figueres grabbed a submachine gun and took off for san jose 
airport after being told that the three nicaraguans demanding to go 
to cuba were refusing to cooperate in efforts to free the passengers 
ill end all this he said as he moved toward the plane 
shots came from the plane and police fired machine guns the 
incident concluded with two hijackers wounded and the passengers 
leaving the plane unharmed 
in his later years before his health failed he traveled the 
world on behalf of costa rica and to many was the personification of 
his country 
costa rica is one of the few countries in the region with a 
substantial middle class much of this is due to costa ricas 
possessing little mineral wealth it was not settled by spaniards 
seeking gold or silver but by european farmers who tended to work 
their own land 
however much of the countrys prosperity was achieved on credit 
and costa rica spends a high percentage of its export earnings 
paying off the debt this has led to unpopular austerity measures in 
recent years 
figueres married henrietta boggs of alabama in 1942 they had two 
children muni and jose marti before the marriage ended in divorce 
in 1952 
he later married karen olsen a naturalized american citizen of 
danish birth they had three children jose maria mariano and 
cristiana his wife now is a member of the national assembly the 
countrys congress 
he also is survived by 17 grandchildren

the security council on friday extended the 
mandate of the un observer group in central america for 19 days to 
complete the lagging demobilization of nicaraguas contra guerrillas 
disbanding of more than 13000 rebel fighters and support 
personnel was to have been completed by june 10 but only about half 
have been disarmed 
the observer group has 995 military personnel in six border 
zones but it ran into trouble when some contra leaders insisted on 
parallel dismantling of some forces of the former sandinista army 
under the new usbacked government 
the councils unanimous decision friday forestalled a 
confrontation between the united states which has backed the 
contras and cuba which supported the former sandinista government 
and blames washington for tension in the region 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar told the council it 
appears impossible to complete the process of demobilization by 
sunday june 10 but rapid progress has been made in the past week 
in some areas

sheriffs deputies burst into a 
record shop friday moments after an undercover detective bought 2 
live crew recordings to make the first arrest since a federal judge 
declared the rap groups album obscene 
ec records owner charles freeman had defiantly ordered a 
shipment of 25 copies of as nasty as they wanna be and was doing 
a brisk business when an undercover officer bought the doublealbum 
and a cassette for 849 each 
before the detective reached the door six deputies rushed in 
handcuffing freeman and arresting him on misdemeanor charges of 
distributing obscene material if convicted he could be sentenced 
to a year in jail and fined 1000 
america is free free for everybody freeman said before 
authorities took him to the broward county jail where he was booked 
and posted 100 bond and as long as this is america and im not 
living in cuba i feel my rights are violated 
the arrest came two days after us district judge jose gonzalez 
found that the sexually explicit recording was without social value 
appealed only to prurient interests and violated community standards 
in dade broward and palm beach counties 
lyrics of many of the songs on the album contain references to 
violence against women and abusive sex though theyre tempered with 
humor 
the inevitable has finally occurred said robyn e blumner 
executive director of the american civil liberties union in florida 
someone in broward is facing jail time because he sold a record 
album to an adult that action put south florida about on a par with 
eastern europe a year ago 
she said the aclu will offer legal representation to freeman 
at a news conference later in miami luther campbell owner and 
president of 2 live crews record label said the company will help 
pay the legal fees of retailers arrested for selling the album 
somebody has to stand up and the retailers i think should 
stand up campbell said we can give them some of the contacts 
we used in our case and we can help them financially campbell did 
not give specifics 
the miamibased rap group sued after sheriff nick navarro sent 
his deputies in march to warn retailers they faced arrest for 
selling the album the sheriff acted after a county judge said the 
material was probably obscene 
gonzalez said the sheriffs office engaged in prior restraint of 
free speech by threatening owners before the recording was ruled 
obscene 
the judge listened to 2 live crews recording which offers a 
frank detailed discussion of sexual positions and practices he 
also heard witnesses and legal anticensorship arguments may 1415 
before issuing his opinion 
michael greene president of the national academy of recording 
arts amp sciences issued a statement in los angeles denouncing the 
courts ruling as politically motivated 
it pungently underlines the oppressive rightwing political 
agenda that is attempting to legislate morality in all the arts 
including music its another attempt to smother freedom in this 
country freedom for the recording artist 
in the three hours before his arrest freeman said he sold all 
but six copies of the recording he said a line had formed outside 
the shop in anticipation of the shipments arrival 
ill go to jail and ill come back and sell it again he 
said i opened up a record store three years ago expecting to sell 
records and this was the furthest thing from my mind 
authorities confiscated the remaining recordings 
friends and customers packed into ec records to complain after 
he was taken to jail for booking on the misdemeanor charge 
assistant manager edward g robinson said freeman felt strongly 
about the issue 
if we can buy them mr freeman will sell them robinson 
said adding that he wont personally i dont care for the 
inside of a jail cell 
why theyd pick this one guy asked gary white 27 in the 
shop with his 19monthold son once they take the rights away 
from one guy its going to spread its not right when a person 
cant express himself 
the judges obscenity ruling has no legal effect outside south 
florida but civil libertarians see a practical effect spreading 
nationally 
supplies of the disputed record dried up in the miami area as the 
obscenity case was argued but the decision was expected to boost 
sales elsewhere 
the decision had no effect on the groups plans for shows friday 
night at club nu in miami beach and saturday night at club futura in 
nearby hollywood 
the group planned to perform its sexually explicit material both 
nights at a late show for adults after an early cleanedup show 
for all ages campbell said

bulgarian border city of russe accused the romanian government of 
refusing to deal seriously with chemical pollution that drifts

1986 when the concentration of chlorine released by the factory 
started to rise 
after a 1987 demonstration then communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu stopped the production of chlorine and hydrochloric acid 
but three 80ton reservoirs of chlorine are still in use for the 
production of other chemicals at the factory

the federal government has no proof that millions of 
dollars seized from financial institutions in south florida is 
linked to a drug cartel and should give the money back to account 
holders attorneys argued friday 
in a nationwide money laundering crackdown in april and may the 
government seized 658 accounts worth over 400 million it 
subsequently released all but 102 accounts including 88 in south 
florida 
us district judge lenore nesbitt heard two hours of arguments 
friday but gave no indication when she would rule on a defense 
motion to free the accounts seized in operation polar cap 
the judge said she would rule later 
prosecutors contended there was probable cause to believe the 
money came from drug smuggling 
scores of lawyers representing the 88 claimants crowded nesbitts 
courtroom but let their positions be represented by a half dozen 
attorneys 
attorney mark schnapp charged that while the government claimed 
the seized accounts were tied to the colombias medellin drug 
cartel they had presented no proof of this when they froze the 
accounts and the complaint was based on stale information 
attorney fred schwartz said he represented a us citizen named 
mark levy who lives in barranquilla colombia 
mr levy is a us citizen with two children who pays his taxes 
in the us and in colombia and sends his children to school in the 
united states said schwartz who said the seizure made it 
impossible for his client to pay his childrens bills 
in defense of the governments case assistant us attorney 
blanton allen told the court friday that in january 1990 after the 
overthrow of manuel noriega in panama a bank there pleaded guilty 
to charges involving money laundering 
transfers of funds from medellin cartel sources resulted allen 
said coming to accounts in miami banks the accounts were traced 
and the government has the day and dates and chapter and verse 
allen said 
these people are not charged and will never appear in court in 
criminal matters allen said they may not be involved but 
their money is 
schwartz and other attorneys have said in the past that their 
clients bought dollars in latin america on the black market a huge 
pot of money swelled by the cocaine trade without knowing the cash 
was drugtainted 
account holders have denied laundering was involved insisting 
the money was flight capital removed from unstable south

the leaders of bulgarias three major 
parties all called for a coalition government after sundays 
elections to tackle the nations serious economic and political 
problems 
but zhelyu zhelev chairman of the opposition union of democratic 
forces said friday night that the udf was not prepared to enter 
into a coalition with the former communists now the governing 
socialist party 
joining zhelev in a television debate on political and economic 
topics were socialist party chief alexander lilov and viktor valkov 
who leads the mainstream agrarian party 
the three parties are expected to take most of the popular vote 
on sunday when a total of 38 parties compete in bulgarias first 
free multiparty elections since 1932 
zhelev declared we are ready to take part in a coalition with 
the asp the alternative socialist party that broke from the 
former communist party after the last party congress early this year 
in a coalition with the socialist party we cannot take part 
not only because of political bias but because it is still burdened 
from the past and cannot carry out the changes bulgaria needs 
zhelev insisted 
he said such a coalition may be possible at some future stage 
but it is not enough for a communist party to wake up and be a 
socialist party 
he was referring to last aprils name change 
all three men refrained from personal attacks or strong 
criticism avoiding serious dispute two days prior to the voting 
the debate was in sharp contrast with campaign violence and harsh 
accusations that may be settled in court long after the elections 
the only real argument came when lilov rejected a shock 
therapy for the national economy 
the slogan used early in the campaign by udf officials was 
dropped later but likov described it as unfeasible and dangerous 
zhelev said it was discarded to defuse socialist claims it would 
cause chaos 
we are for a quick wellthoughtout radical road to a market 
economy the udf chairman said 
when a bulgarian goes to a shop and finds no sugar this is a 
shock or when he hears about an 11 billion foreign debt and has 
seen none of the money that is a shock and there is no 
therapy offered by the socialists he declared 
let us not frighten people with shock therapy neither you nor 
we are interested in this 
likov pressed his argument saying such a course of action had 
caused 3700 percent annual inflation in argentina 
valkov called for integrating the party of the nonaffiliated 
people they have a lot of good dignified people in their ranks 
lilov said his party was ready to form a broad coalition on the 
basis of national consensus and we hold out the hand to all 
political parties 
zhelev complained about remnants of totalitarianism including 
the one party government 
he and lilov also disagreed on the need for private ownership 
with lilov saying private ownership by itself will not take us 
out of the crisis 
the three politicians agreed they would respect the voters 
decision sunday 
bulgarias longtime hardline communist party chief todor 
zhivkov was ousted last november

markus wolf east germanys 
celebrated former spy chief was quoted friday as saying some former 
agents may now be working for the soviet kgb 
however wolf said he thought any such defections were individual 
cases rather than the result of wholesale recruitment according to 
an interview in the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper of munich 
wolf called for a meeting of officials from both germanys to try 
to resolve the problem of innergerman espionage he predicted the 
longer it takes to resolve how a united germany deals with former 
communist spies the greater the danger even more east german agents 
will defect to other spy networks 
wolf 67 recently returned to east berlin from moscow where he 
said he went to finish work on a book west german counterespionage 
officials alleged he was meeting with the kgb to turn over east 
germanys spy network in west germany 
wolf retired in 1987 as head of foreign intelligence in communist 
east germanys security ministry where he gained a reputation as 
one of the most skilled intelligence chiefs in the east bloc 
west germany has an arrest warrant out for him for his espionage 
activities but wolf is protected as long as the two germansy remain 
separate countries west german officials have not yet decided how 
they will handle east german spies after unification 
the munich abendzeitung newspaper on friday quoted guenther 
beckstein a senior official in the bavarian interior ministry as 
saying east germany should hand wolf over to west germany for 
prosecution 
beckstein likened wolfs case to that of suspected terrorist 
susanne albrecht who was captured by east german authorities in 
east berlin on wednesday and is expected to be turned over to west 
germany next week 
in bonn spokesman roland bachmeier of the west german interior 
ministry said a meeting of the two german interior ministers in 
april provided the information that led to albrechts capture west 
german authorities had sought ms albrecht a suspected member of 
the leftist red army faction for 13 years 
the red army faction has been blamed for a wave of terror in west 
germany since the early 1970s

prime minister toshiki kaifu stood up to heavy us 
pressure friday and refused one of washingtons key demands to make 
japans economy more accessible to american businesses 
kaifus tough stand suggests his government can assert itself 
despite washingtons threats to retaliate if japan fails to slash 
its 49 billion trade surplus with the united states 
kaifus decision comes even as some observers are detecting a 
change in japans legendary resistance to imports on thursday 
japan accepted us technology as the standard for a new generation 
of cellular phones 
but kaifu said japan would not give in to a us demand that it 
set an annual timetable for increasing spending on public works the 
demand was raised in the structural impediments initiative talks 
which are aimed at eliminating structural trade barriers 
kaifu said this had settled the issue i dont quite understand 
why they are raising the issue again he told reporters 
the prime minister spoke on the same day kyodo news service 
quoted an unidentified senior us official as saying japan was 
dragging its feet in preparing a final trade report outlining more 
reforms 
japan agreed in april to boost public spending which would 
expand the number of projects that us firms could bid on the 
united states demanded a definite annual spending target something 
japan refused to provide instead it said it would specify a total 
figure for the next 10 years overall 
japan also agreed in april to deregulate its complex distribution 
system including a relaxation on the establishment of large retail 
stores to increase enforcement of antitrust laws with tougher 
penalties for bidrigging and to work to lower land prices 
cited by washington as an unfair trade partner in satellites 
supercomputers and forest products japan last month agreed to 
expand opportunities for us businesses in those industries 
after the agreement president bush dropped japan from the list 
of unfair trade partners under the 1988 omnibus trade act countries 
on the list can face tariffs of up to 100 percent on certain goods 
but some congressmen in washington still want japan on the list 
us and japanese negotiators will meet in tokyo on june 2526 to 
hammer out the final report on the structural impediments 
initiative but the japanese government already has begun to 
implement some of the reforms 
last month the ministry of international trade and industry told 
local governments it had shortened the application period for 
opening large retail stores this will benefit us retailers 
on june 6 japans fair trade commission issued new guidelines 
that would prohibit manufacturers from pressuring discount shops 
that sell goods below manufacturerrecommended prices 
but the most potent symbol of japans recent willingness to open 
its markets may be its adoption thursday of digital cellularphone 
technology by motorola inc of schaumburg ill 
motorolas codec speech coder system the technology to 
digitalize voice sounds and send them to a receiving unit 
outperformed six japanese and one swedish company to be chosen as 
the national standard japanese officials said 
that has been unthinkable during the past 40 years but it 
happened said richard c koo senior economist with the nomura 
research institute a think tank connected with nomura securities 
i was stunned 
japans cellular phone market is estimated to be worth about 2 
billion over the next five years enough to put a dent in the 49 
billion trade imbalance 
the imbalance has been shrinking yearly from a high of 563 
billion in 1987 it has been declining more dramatically this year 
with a surplus in march of 36 billion down 143 percent from a 
year earlier according to the us department of commerce 
a major reason for the decline since 1987 has been the yens 
strength compared to the dollar which makes japanese products more 
expensive overseas and imports cheaper 
but some economists say a more fundamental reason for the decline 
is that japan is finally becoming a consumptionoriented society 
after years of sacrifice to build the economy

nelson mandela on friday said the west should 
maintain economic sanctions on south africa until the white 
government ends apartheid and the country is no longer considered 
the skunk of the world 
the african national congress leader said the south african 
economy then would require massive international aid if we are to 
move forward at a pace that recognized the urgency of the needs of 
our people 
mandela 71 on the second leg of a sixweek transatlantic 
trip canceled a morning meeting with red cross officials due to 
fatigue a red cross spokeswoman said 
but he spoke later to the international labor organization the 
world council of churches and foreign minister rene felber 
mandela received a loud ovation from more than 2000 delegates to 
the un labor organization 
he told the 150nation assembly he was encouraged by thursdays 
lifting of the state of emergency in most of south africa as well as 
by the release of more political prisoners 
these steps constitute part of the process of implementing what 
was agreed with president fw de klerk a month ago he said 
of course more will have to be done to ensure that the agreement 
is implemented in full 
he said he was convinced that de klerk and his colleagues are 
men and women of integrity but until what was agreed has been 
done we cannot afford to lower our guard and relax economic 
sanctions 
mandela freed in february after 27 years in prison concluded 
his speech by speaking of the glorious vision of a south africa 
free of racism free of racial antagonisms among our people no 
longer a threat to peace no longer the skunk of the world 
the un agency which sets international standards for labor 
conditions expelled south africa 25 years ago for its racial 
policies 
under apartheid the nations 28 million blacks are deprived of a 
say in the government while the 5 million whites control the 
economy and maintain separate services 
at the geneva headquarters of the world council of churches 
hundreds of supports gave mandela the clenchedfist anc salute 
he thanked the meeting for the support given him and fellow 
antiapartheid fighters by the council which has provided financial 
assistance to the anc for more than a decade 
speaking with a firm voice and without a text he said 
religions christian and nonchristian have been the only source 
of hope for many years for him 
during talks with the foreign minister mandela urged switzerland 
to add to western pressure on south africa and impose its own 
sanctions against the country a government spokesman said 
neutral switzerland has never joined in the sanctions but has 
repeatedly condemned racial segregation 
spokesman michel pache said that during the 90minute meeting in 
bern the capital felber said switzerland was ready to promote 
economic contacts with the anc 
mandela will stay in switzerland this weekend before continuing 
to west germany italy canada the united states ireland britain 
and several african countries he is scheduled to meet with swiss

arsenic was found in freed hostage frank reeds 
system shortly after his return to the united states hospital 
officials announced friday 
reed 57 has been undergoing treatment at the malcolm grow 
medical center at andrews air force base in maryland since soon 
after his release from 44 months in captivity in lebanon april 30 
in a statement the hospital said screening for heavy metals such 
as arsenic lead and mercury was normal procedure for returning 
hostages or prisoners 
these tests were performed on mr reeds arrival the initial 
test for arsenic was positive subsequent tests confirmed this 
exposure to arsenic and its elimination to a nontoxic level the 
hospital said 
hospital officials were unavailable to say how much arsenic was 
found how it affected his health or how it might have gotten in 
reeds system 
reeds arsenic levels were abnormally high reeds attorney bob 
woolf said in a telephone interview from miami 
this was beyond what was normal believe me woolf said it 
was enough to be concerned about 
woolf refused to comment on the possible source of the arsenic 
he said some of the toxin had been eliminated from reeds body since 
he began medical treatment but that traces remained 
its not completely out of his system but now its at a 
controlled nontoxic level woolf said 
reeds wife fahima said she believed her husband had been 
poisoned by his captors 
what else could it be the arsenic couldnt get in his body 
just like that she said 
im outraged that they would have done something like this 
she added im just happy that hes ok that nothings been 
damaged 
dr alan woolf director of the massachusetts poison center said 
trace amounts of arsenic could get into a persons system from water 
and food especially seafood 
you or i might have traces of arsenic in our blood after a 
heavy seafood dinner the doctor said its used as a wood 
preservative and as a pesticide 
peggy say sister of hostage terry anderson said she was 
appalled by the news and worried it could mean other hostages could 
also be affected 
if the arsenic poisoning is deliberate it is the worst kind of 
barbarism ms say said by telephone from her home in cadiz ky 
if it is not deliberate they are apparently living in conditions 
in which their surroundings are putting this arsenic into their 
systems either way it is an extremely serious problem 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was taken hostage march 16 1985 reed has said he last saw 
anderson between a year and 18 months ago 
the attorney said reed was surprised by the finding 
it was a little shocking and frightening for him woolf said 
this was serious and totally unexpected 
the attorney said it was still unclear how the poison would 
affect reeds health the malden mass native was gaunt and weak 
after his release and during a memorial day visit to his hometown 
he said he suffered from severe anemia 
we still dont know what all the ramifications are woolf 
said but he seems to be coming along fine hes gaining weight 
and im hopeful hell be released in a few weeks 
reed was the director of the private lebanese international 
school in beirut when he was seized by islamic extremists in 1986 
after his release he told of being beaten when he tried to escape 
and of being chained and blindfolded for months at a time 
arsenic a silverywhite poisonous chemical element is used to 
make insecticides glass medicines and semiconductors exposure to 
high levels of the substance can produce a burning pain in the 
esophagus and stomach vomiting diarrhea and depression 
prolonged exposure can lead to a rapid feeble pulse and 
circulatory collapse

the national science foundation said friday it 
would back a major research effort aimed at developing longdistance 
data exchange networks that can work 20 to 700 times faster than 
todays best 
the foundation and the defense departments research agency the 
defense advanced research projects agency will spend 15 million 
over the next three years to develop five experimental mininetworks 
that can transfer data at 1 billion bits a gigabit per second 
collaborators including government agencies universities 
computer companies and communications firms are expected to 
contribute several times as much money the foundation said 
such a speed would enable 70 fat novels of 300000 words each to 
be transmitted every second 
todays fiber optic cables can carry data that fast from point to 
point it is the switches and datahandling routines for a network 
that must be developed and these are only now beginning to emerge 
from the laboratory 
this is what telephone companies will be bringing to the 
table said charles brownstein acting assistant director for 
computer and information sciences at the foundation 
we dont even know yet that such a network can be developed 
and it may take until the next century to build one said alan 
levitt a spokesman for the foundation 
one of the experiments if all goes well will enable 
neurosurgeons at the university of north carolina to simulate an 
operation using catscan images of a patients brain called up from 
a distant computer before they operate on the actual patient 
the surgeons will be able to say lets see what happens when 
we peel back this layer of tissue or put that one back and lets 
peel back this layer said brownstein this requires a 
tremendous data file 
todays best networks brownstein said operate at 15 million 
bits per second to 45 million bits per second or 188000 to 56 
million characters per second a facsimile machines best speed is 
1200 characters per second

the arab leagues un envoy friday said 
israels new hardline government was a blessing in disguise and 
said the rightwing adiministration might force the united states to 
get tougher with its ally 
clovis maksoud permanent observer of the 22nation arab league 
said the government which will consist of acting prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc and smaller ultranationalist 
and religious parties could force congress to reexamine its 
relationship with israel 
shamirs government which still needs parliamentary approval 
has vowed to expand jewish settlement in the occupied territories 
and has indicated it is prepared to use harsher measures to quell 
the 30monthold palestinian uprising against israels rule of the 
west bank and gaza strip 
the united states has called jewish settlements an obstacle to 
peace and has tried to encourage israel to open peace talks with a 
palestinian delegation 
i hope formation of this new cabinet will jolt the us 
administration and the us congress to come back to their 
historical sense of fairness in the middle east maksoud said 
after a strategy meeting with arab representatives 
this can be a blessing in disguise if it awakens the us 
administration from permissiveness to allow israel to proceed with 
the defiance of the international community he added 
maksoud also criticized the united states saying it has shielded 
israel from international censure by using its veto in the un 
security council 
on thursday the united states blocked an arabsponsored security 
council resolution calling for a un team to visit the occupied 
territories and investigate allegations of israeli abuses of 
palestinian human rights

president bush said friday night were making 
progress in easing soviet fears about a united germany in nato 
bush said he and west german chancellor helmut kohl agreed that 
moscow has understandable interests in the military future of 
europe 
bush and kohl met for more than two hours over dinner at the 
white house to discuss germany unification and soviet objections to 
a new germany belonging to the usled nato alliance 
the meeting their third in three weeks came on the heels of 
bushs summit with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who 
expressed strong concerns about nato membership for a united germany 
bush said that western leaders at a nato summit in london early 
next month would explore ways to allay soviet fears 
kohl said we germans as a matter of course also are going 
to bear in mind soviet security its going to be important that 
nato and the warsaw pact meet in a good atmosphere 
gorbachev in opposing nato membership for a united germany has 
proposed that the new country be a member of both the warsaw pact as 
well as nato or be a member of neither he also has suggested 
limits on the size of the german army an idea opposed both by kohl 
and bush 
any singling out and neutralization always means isolation 
kohl said out of the isolation of germany which we had in the 
20s a lot of bad things came about we want a unified germany as 
part of nato 
bush expressed confidence that gorbachevs fears would be laid to 
rest 
i think were making progress but i cant make a prediction as 
to how successful totally successful were going to be bush 
said 
bush and kohl emphasized that there is no difference between them 
in insisting that a new germany be a full military and political 
member of the usled nato alliance 
i never expected that this important question could be solved 
overnight kohl said 
he voiced hopes that the socalled twoplusfour talks involving 
the four allied victors of world war ii and the two germanies 
complete their work by fall the participants are the united states 
soviet union britain france west germany and east germany 
bush returning from an overnight political trip to the midwest 
met kohl before heading off the camp david for the weekend kohl 
who gave the commencement address at harvard university on thursday 
headed home 
bush said that he and kohl agreed that the soviets who lost 27 
million people in world war ii triggered by german aggression 
have understandable interests in all of this but we did not try 
to fashion some compromise solution 
asked why he felt so confident about winning over the soviets 
bush said i just had the feeling from talks with gorbachev that 
the soviet leader was moving toward the wests position 
they also paid some lip service gave some credibility to the 
idea that a country could choose what alliance it was going to be 
in bush said 
the facts are on our side the president said a united 
germany in nato will not be threatening to the soviet union a us 
presence in europe will not be threatening to the soviet union 
so weve just got to keep on making our case 
in fact poland and czechoslovakia still nominally allies of the 
soviet union and east germany in the warsaw pact have said they 
prefer a united germany in nato to one outside the alliance 
bush told political fundraising audiences in omaha and des moines 
that the german issues will not be resolved easily or quickly 
we must see that german reunification adheres to the wishes of 
the german people while respecting the views of other nations 
bush told a luncheon for republican senatorial candidate hal daub 
serious differences still remain he said 
earlier at a fundraising speech in des moines iowa bush said 
that agreements struck at the summit we hope represent the 
beginning of the end of the cold war 
gorbachev has said repeatedly that the cold war is already over 
asked by reporters aboard air force one on the way to omaha from 
des moines whether he and gorbachev had different views on this 
subject bush said 
i dont know weve got a difference of semantics dont we 
weve got to wait and see how we can resolve all these problems 
out here there are plenty of them around 
however he added in his remarks on the presidential aircraft 
i felt the summit moved in the right direction 
bush said that secretary of state james a baker iii returning 
to washington for the meeting with kohl was bringing with him a 
certain degree of optimism from his talks in europe on the german 
issue with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
but bush added well have to wait and see 
soviet officials have also suggested that a 35nation european 
council made up of east and west bloc states take over the roles 
of the two postworld war ii alliances the united states has 
rejected that idea 
as he wrapped up two days of political campaigning in wisconsin 
illinois iowa and nebraska bush continued to emphasize the 
importance to the farm belt of trade and grain agreements made at 
last weeks superpower summit 
on other matters bush told reporters aboard air force one 
that he hopes the senate will ustain his veto of a 2 billion 
transportation authorization bill which includes funds for amtrak 
and not follow the example of the house which voted on thursday to 
override the veto however bush conceded i think its going to 
be very close 
that he views as unfortunate the shoving by a secret service 
agent of condoleezza rice bushs senior adviser on soviet affairs 
and the highest ranking black woman at the white house she was 
shoved while accompanying gorbachev in san francisco bush said it 
was important to see that such an episode does not happen again 
while adding that i have great respect for the secret service and 
how they do their job

a full moon and high tides brought 
horseshoe crabs to the shores of the delaware bay on friday for 
their yearly mating game 
the females dug into beaches along the bay laying millions of 
green shotgun pelletsized eggs many of them had males hooked onto 
their tails and each would drag the male over the eggs so he could 
fertilize the batch 
horseshoe crabs with long spiked tails are known to completely 
cover beaches laying shelltoshell while shore birds and seagulls 
hover around eating the eggs 
on friday there was also a human factor in the scenario 
volunteers hit the beaches in delaware and new jersey counting 
and tagging the menacinglooking creatures 
the plans called for tagging 2000 horseshoe crabs in delaware 
alone 
the work is part of research being conducted in both states to 
learn about their migration patterns and lifespans 
delaware bay has the largest numbers of horseshoe crabs on the 
east coast according to tim jacobsen an assistant research 
professor at rutgers university they are found as far north as new 
hampshire and as far south as florida jacobsen said 
in delaware bay no one knows how large the population is how 
long the horseshoe crabs live or whether their numbers are declining 
we want to see if the population is stable is it going up is 
it going down said marian johnson pohlman outdoor recreation 
planner for bombay hook national wildlife refuge near smyrna 
pohlman was in charge of counting at port mahon just east of little 
creek 
she said people use horseshoe crabs for bait and officials need 
to know if too many are being taken it takes a horseshoe crab 11 
years to mature and be able to lay eggs pohlman said

it may take two months to clean 260000 
gallons of heavy heating oil that leaked from a grounded british 
tanker into a commercial waterway the coast guard said friday 
the coast guard said it had received reports of grapefruitsize 
tar balls as far as 15 miles away coming ashore along sandy hook 
and breezy point the points that flank the mouth of new york harbor 
about 9000 gallons of the industrial fuel has been recovered so 
far said coast guard capt robert north adding that usually just 
15 percent to 20 percent of a spill is recaptured 
north is overseeing the cleanup that began when the bt nautilus 
ran aground early thursday morning while docking in bayonne 
the remainder of the oil will either dissipate or sink in the 
kill van kull a shipping channel between and staten island ny 
and an industrial stretch of new jersey shoreline officials said 
the coast guard and the new york and new jersey attorneys 
general offices were all investigating the spill civil and criminal 
charges were considered said judith yaskin new jersey commissioner 
for the environment 
the accident one of several significant oil spills in the new 
york harbor this year boosted the amount spilled in the area to 
more than 1 million gallons or four times the 1989 total the coast 
guard said that is less than onetenth the size of the catastrophic 
exxon valdez spill in alaskas pristine prince william sound 
coast guard rear adm gene henn said a board of inquiry will 
begin hearings monday because we do not know if it is bad luck or 
a common thread that binds these incidents the board is to make 
recommendations within weeks not months he said 
the tankers first mate englishman geoffrey frederick gregory 
52 faces state charges of operating a vessel while under the 
influence of either alcohol or drugs 
he pleaded innocent at his arraignment thursday was released on 
bail and is to appear in bayonne municipal court on june 12 
he is also charged with negligent discharge of a pollutant 
without a permit the case is to be presented to a state grand jury 
in trenton next week said christopher florentz a spokesman for 
attorney general robert j del tufo adding that the investigation 
is continuing 
capt james sanial in charge of the coast guard probe said 
until the grounding there was no communication between gregory on 
duty at the front of the boat and the captain and pilot in the 
ships bridge 
the tankers captain albert ainscough and docking pilot jim 
naughton were interviewed after the accident and said they noticed 
nothing amiss until the grounding 
sanial said naughton had no previous record of accidents 
ultimately the master captain is always responsible for the 
ship in actual practice the pilot takes over during docking 
said sanial 
more than 200 workers including about 50 guardsmen were 
cleaning the water and shores friday said north the operation 
involved 47 vessels including five boats equipped to skim oil from 
the surface and a special coast guard oil spill response team from 
mobile ala 
the tanker owner nautilus motor tanker of gibraltar has assumed 
responsibility for the cleanup the coast guard said the tanker is 
operated by bulk tanker management of london and registered in hong

roy and marge heimdal marched into a peoria 
bank friday clutching coffee cans stuffed with money as they 
concluded a fundraising campaign to ransom their son held in south 
america 
in less than four days the heimdals raised 60000 demanded as 
ransom by maoist guerrillas who ambushed 27yearold scott heimdal 
in a jungle in ecuador on april 28 
mrs heimdal 47 said the kidnappers reportedly members of a 
colombian group known as the popular liberation army have 
threatened to show us where his body is 
the attack left one man dead and another seriously injured 
a shiver went down my spine when they told me we had 60000 
roy heimdal said friday about 80 hours after the financially 
strapped family went on tv to seek public help in raising money 
im stunned said heimdal who sells cabinets if there had 
been any other way to handle this we would have but a public 
appeal was the only avenue we had 
even as the heimdals fought their way through a herd of reporters 
into the bank strangers approached with dollar bills for their 
overflowing coffee cans and words of encouragement 
for the first few weeks we felt so helpless mrs heimdal 
said at least these past few days weve felt like we were helping 
scott we were doing something and that felt good 
the 60000 was wired to a bank in ecuador where it will be taken 
by an intermediary into the jungle along the ecuadorcolombia border 
this weekend to meet the kidnappers 
the funds will be handled by a professional negotiators who

prison author jack henry abbott acting as his 
own lawyer in a wrongful death suit friday introduced himself with 
an apology to the crying widow of the young actor he stabbed to 
death nine years ago 
i almost dont know what to say except to say im very sorry 
for the death of richard adan abbott told ricci adan 32 
then in their first exchange of words ever abbott asked mrs 
adan are you under the impression i murdered your husband 
mrs adan looked at abbott in apparent disbelief and said i 
know you killed my husband i know you took a knife and thrust it 
into his chest i know he died hes dead hes not here 
abbott convicted of firstdegree manslaughter in adans death 
maintains the slaying was not murder because he thought adan was 
going to harm him 
mrs adan said she refused to attend the trial in her husbands 
death 
you were not in my courtroom abbott seemed amazed 
no i didnt want to see all that the widow said i didnt 
want to see you i didnt want to hear you you killed my husband 
how could you do that 
does anything matter to you other than richard adan died at my 
hands 
yes she replied something has to balance out there has 
to be some restitution some kind of payback for what you did to my 
husband 
before abbott began his disjointed crossexamination mrs adan 
testified that her husband had won a role on a public broadcasting 
system television series a development she called a big break 
we were having dreams about our future together as a husband 
and wife mrs adan said everything was so bright he promised 
me children he said we wouldnt have to go handtomouth anymore 
we wouldnt have to struggle so much 
abbott 46 convicted in 1982 of firstdegree manslaughter in 
adans death is serving a 15yeartolife sentence mrs adan has 
sued abbott for 10 million for her husbands wrongful death and 
pain and suffering 
abbott gained fame from writing in the belly of the beast a 
bestseller composed of letters he sent from prison to author norman 
mailer from 1978 through 1981 
during that period abbott was in prison first for bank robbery 
and then for fatally stabbing another inmate mailer later supported 
abbotts parole largely because of his writing talent 
mrs adans lawyer estimates that abbott has a little more than 
100000 in an escrow account held by the sheriff in manhattan in 
case of a civil judgement in mrs adans favor 
abbott had been free six weeks when he killed adan around 5 am 
july 18 1981 in front of the binibon restaurant at second avenue 
and fifth street adan was a waiter at the restaurant partly owned 
by his fatherinlaw 
earlier friday eyewitness wayne larsen reiterated that abbott 
stabbed adan after sneaking up behind him reaching around from 
behind and plunging a knife into the victims chest 
on cross examination larsen got abbotts standard question 
did you read my book 
larsen said he began it but what i read was so revolting i had 
not appetite for the rest you were describing what it felt like to 
plunge a knife into a mans chest 
larsen also said he will never forget what he saw but tries not 
think about it its the lowest that ive seen a human being sink 
to thats you im talking about he told abbott

a federal judge gave the los angeles county 
board of supervisors a 20day deadline thursday to submit a plan for 
remapping districts to provide hispanics with representation and 
erase ballot box discrimination 
us district judge david kenyon whose ruling monday in a voting 
rights suit could affect november elections declared i do 
believe time is important here 
he warned that if the supervisors fail to meet his deadline he 
will do whatever is necessary to devise a redistricting plan 
kenyon suggested that the supervisors hold more than their 
regular meetings to draft a proposal to be presented to him on june 
27 
i want to make it clear said kenyon this is a deadline 
after that the court will feel free to do whatever is necessary to 
come up with a plan 
supervisor mike antonovich who attended the federal court 
hearing told reporters he thought 20 days was insufficient time in 
which to hold public hearings on the issue antonovich is one of the 
boards conservative majority which voted to appeal kenyons 
decision mandating new districts 
attorney marc rosenbaum of the american civil liberties union 
which joined the us justice department lawsuit on the matter said 
hearings could be held immediately 
on monday the day before a statewide election kenyon issued a 
long awaited ruling in the voting rights lawsuit 
he found that board members conspired to protect their 
incumbencies and that of their allies when they redrew the 
countys five voting districts in 1981 
the lawsuit filed in august 1988 charged the supervisors 
deliberately spread the countys hispanic population across several 
districts when they changed voting boundaries following the 1980 
federal census 
hispanics make up an estimated 35 percent of the countys 87 
million people but no hispanic has been elected to the board since 
1875 
liberal supervisors have called for a settlement which would 
increase the number of districts and supervisors to offer more 
representation

for rosario murillo former president 
daniel ortegas companion of many years the outcome of februarys 
elections meant liberation as well as loss 
theres no doubt im happier now she said in an interview 
i had a series of responsibilities that didnt let me do art 
murillo a poet and singer headed cultural institutions during 
nearly 11 years of sandinista rule she has not left political life 
but moved out of her office into the street to revive stagnant party 
spirit and bolster wavering militants 
it could be that we bureaucratized ourselves too much in power 
thats the natural tendency murillo said after leading protesters 
at the supreme court in a medley of sometimes nostalgic 
revolutionary songs 
artists didnt perform in the street while the sandinistas 
governed because the rules made it too hard she said you had 
to talk to 50 bureaucrats to get permission to do one performance 
she said sandinista singers artists and writers will have a 
chance to put political content back into their work even 
sandinista artists had been just wanted for entertainment she 
told the interviewer 
murillo has found a new vocation in leading protests of president 
violeta barrios de chamorros government 
they are small compared to past sandinista crowds only 1200 
people most of them employees of the government telephone company 
appeared at the supreme court on may 22 to demand that it overturn a 
new civil service law 
in the past month murillo has spoken almost daily to workers 
students and artists on may 25 she protested a government plan to 
reopen a public street that passes through a sandinista compound 
where she and ortega live 
the sandinistas experts in symbolic battle said the 
governments desire to tear down the brick wall blocking the street 
symbolized efforts to destroy everything the sandinistas had built 
including free health care public education and land reform 
its also an attack on the security of the party said aldo 
cajina a sandinista party worker who rushed to the compound to 
support murillo the government has backed off at least temporarily 
sandinista lyrics sometimes have an ironic ring since mrs 
chamorros victory they say we will win the people united 
will never be defeated its not enough to pray theres lots 
to be done to achieve peace 
demobilization of ussupported contra guerrillas is going 
slowly murillo says and claims the chamarro government is 
threatening to reestablish the power of the rich over the poor 
the intercontinental hotel is full of fat businessmen from 
miami who lived in exile while the sandinistas ruled she said 
this government is starting to look like somozas she 
declared using what has become a standard sandinista phrase 
likening mrs chamorros government to that of president anastasio 
somoza whom the sandinistas overthrew in july 1979 
murillo hair cut in a short punk style dressed in tight yellow 
pants and a hawaiianstyle flowered shirt said she worried about 
the new governments cultural conservatism 
were returning to a troglodyte epoch she said using 
another party expression for the attempt by some chamorro officials 
to forbid miniskirts in government offices 
like most party militants murillo puts the best face on the 
sandinista election loss the people will realize their error she 
said and return the prty to power in six years if not sooner 
in the meantime the demonstrations she leads contribute to the 
partys effort to renew its identity and hold wavering militants to 
the faith 
its a great opportunity that nicaragua has she said its 
unique theres more passion now here the revolution is being 
reborn 
not all of her concerts are so overtly political as the singing 
outside the supreme court she said but the demonstration needed 
a very concrete message 
they didnt come out to hear chopin she observed 
she has not forgotten the grim dawn of feb 26 when she was part 
of one of the most riveting tableaus in nicaraguan history her arms 
crossed face raw with tears she stood behind ortega as he conceded 
that the voters had rejected sandinismo 
murillo said she was happier not having to hold herself in check 
to think about her relationship with ortega every time she wanted to 
participate in something 
people always saw me as someones shadow she said i had 
to be careful because i didnt know how it would affect his image 
it was an impossible selfcensorship

one sunday morning president 
fernando collor de mello climbed into an f5b fighter beside a 
brazilian air force pilot for an hour of aerial acrobatics 
he pulled out a camera during the flight and took his own 
picture next day the photo was on front pages across the country 
it was a stunt typical of collor whose vigorous mediaconscious 
style has charmed many brazilians and irritated others since his 
inauguration in march 
at 40 he is brazils youngest president he is the first since 
1960 to be chosen by popular vote 
collor arrived like a whirlwind in brasilia a placid inland 
capital run for a generation by generals and bureaucrats 
brazilians have watched him soar through the air in an 
ultralight race along back roads on a black motorcycle zip over 
water on a jetski and glide beneath it in a submarine he has 
bicycled kayaked jogged swum and worked at karate soccer and 
volleyball 
a note from president bush to a former ambassador published in 
rio newspapers referred to the brazilian leader as indiana 
collor 
when the president recently announced plans to go skydiving his 
mother thought it was too much 
everyone please write him letters ask him to stop leda 
collor de mello said in an interview on government radio im as 
worried as you are 
her son changed his mind and ruled out skydiving 
last week a gasolinesoaked pile of illicit cocaine and 
marijuana exploded in flames when he dropped a torch on it he 
covered his face and retreated suffering a singed right ear hair 
and forearm 
critics say the media events reflect a shallow populism aimed 
at the poor millions who are collors chief supporters 
collor governs by creating spectacular events rep jose 
genoino of the leftist workers party said in an interview he 
presents the image of a strong president in contrast to a weak 
society 
jair meneguelli president of the 12 millionmember central 
workers union which supported leftist candidate luis inacio lula da 
silva in the december election described the presidential outings 
as a stupid recourse to call attention to himself 
collor a black belt in karate wrote in an article for veja 
brazils largest newsweekly ive always had a passion for sports 
today im in a position where i have to set an example 
a similar style has been evident throughout his political career 
when campaigning for local office in his poor home state of 
alagoas in northeastern brazil where political assassination is not 
uncommon collor would beat his chest at rallies and defy the hired 
pistoleiros of his adversaries to shoot him 
at the presidential inauguration in march he dismissed his 
driver and made the 5minute trip from the presidential palace to 
congress on foot he strode down the esplandade of ministries with 
cabinet members struggling to keep pace 
every friday he crosses the street in front of the presidential 
palace to mingle with wellwishers much to the discontent of his 
secret service guards in the crowd collor signs autographs shakes 
hands and receives kisses and slaps on the back 
to make sure stores were obeying a price freeze he imposed the 
president dropped in at a brasilia supermarket and pushed a shopping 
cart through the aisles 
at the produce section he stopped and snapped at the startled 
manager these potatoes are rotten remove them at once 
he wrote a check for the 28 worth of food he bought and gave 
the bag to a boy who was begging outside the store 
all agree collor is a master of television his good looks 
elegant suits and measured baritone are perfectly suited to it 
tv is the great instrument of communication in brazil where 20 
percent of the people are illiterate and only 10 percent have 
completed the eighth grade political scientist helio jaguaribe 
said in an interview 
collor froze 115 billion in bank and money market deposits 
changed the currency from cruzados to cruzeiros and invited the 
press along when to encourage savings he opened an account with 
the equivalent of 100 
its all a show genoino said it comes from his 
authoritarian concept of government a charismatic leader with 
everything centered on himself 
allegations of authoritarianism increased after collor introduced 
his economic plan by decree march 16 and told legislators not to 
tamper with it 
he is a little emperor sa1nd meneguelli the labor leader 
he tried to sit on congress and then was forced to back off to 
avert an explosion 
some see collors style as a throwback to the classic latin 
american caudillo or populist leader 
latin america unfortunately swings between caudillos and 
dictatorships genoino said multiparty politics still doesnt 
exist its part of our backwardness 
others feel collor has accurately read a public desire for an 
active decisive president 
he is exercising his authority but is not authoritarian 
jaguaribe said theres a difference brazilians like that 
because the previous government showed very little authority 
jose sarney collors predecessor was widely seen as weak and 
incompetent his unpopular administration blamed for annual 
inflation of 4000 percent 
a comparison seems inevitable said claudio humberto rosa e 
silva press spokesman for collor we have a young handsome 
athletic courageous and competent president he replaced one 
who was ugly short old and cowardly

during last weeks nbc affiliates convention 
deborah norville faced station officials and said of the today 
cast this is a family im sorry the print press doesnt see it 
that way 
nbc hopes a more important audience viewers will see it that 
way today as it relaunches today with joe garagiola faith 
daniels and katie couric joining norville bryant gumbel willard 
scott and gene shalit on the troubled show 
the networks we are family plan puts a lot of hope on the 
addition of the gregarious garagiola 64 a popular today 
cohost from 1969 to 1973 hell join gumbel and norville as cohost 
on tuesdays through thursdays 
the print press keeps calling them cohosts wrong nbc recently 
has been emphasizing gumbel is the shows anchor norville and 
garagiola are coanchors oh the print press has said 
daniels late of cbs will be the news anchor while couric who 
has a lively wit will be the shows national correspondent based in 
washington where one can find far more harrumph than humor 
only time will tell as they say on tv whether the newcomers and 
nbcs imagerebuilding effort makes nielsen families welcome the 
show back to their bosoms or at least to the peoplemeters in 4000 
homes 
as all but the dead know cohost jane pauley left the show in 
december after 13 years she was privately angered by today 
changes that began last summer but steadfastly has refused to blame 
norville her successor 
since pauleys exit the previously toprated today has been 
riding the crest of a slump 
it has trailed abcs good morning america for 22 weeks its 
yeartodate ratings are 17 percent below those of 1989 and theyre 
down 17 percent in what some consider a key demographic group 
women aged 18 to 49 
that means uhoh time the ratings drop translates into millions 
of dollars in lost advertising revenue for both nbc and its 209 
affiliates 
however notes betsy frank a senior vice president at saatchi amp 
saatchi advertising in new york the drop didnt start when norville 
became today cohost in january just five months after she 
became its news anchor 
the shows ratings were trending down even before the 
cataclysmic norvillepauley change she says 
thats why nbc officials began tinkering with today in the 
first place to get the ratings back up alas they foaled only a 
public relations nightmare and failure 
in round two of tinkering the hiring of old pro garagiola came 
as a surprise particularly to those expecting nbc to commit 
thirtysomething video voodoo to win back those younger 
demographically desirable female viewers 
but the bald affable former major league catcher probably will 
do that says tom capra a today rookie he became the shows 
executive producer in january 
i think hes kind of an everyman capra says everyone 
likes joe younger women old men everybody hes just kind of a 
universal figure 
capra tends to scoff at those who write of the women 18to49 age 
group as if that group were to morning ratings what oxygen is to 
life its ownself 
hed like to have that audience watching today he says but 
it is not gigantic in the morning on any show and he says 
our show as are all the other morning shows is sold on the basis 
of households as well as demographics 
we also think that our core today audience is still loyal to 
us capra says and just isnt watching us as often as they used 
to so we believe that the addition of joe will cause them to come 
home 
frank says nbc in seeking the top today ratings of 
yesteryear is hoping to recapture some of that warmth and family 
appeal the show once had 
garagiola seems to be a pretty good choice she says but 
my question is whether people for whatever reason have not 
gotten into the good morning america habit and whether the 
addition of joe is enough to bring today back

war and rain have made a rusty steel 
cable 50 feet above a swollen river the umbilical cord between half 
of morazan province and the rest of el salvador 
isolation that has come with every rainy season since 1983 when 
guerrillas blew up the bridge makes a hard life harder for the 
50000 people north of the torola river 
they are virtually cut off from may to october when the river is 
too deep for even trucks to ford 
the people of this town nestled among mistshrouded hills pray 
for the war to end 
salt cooking oil sugar almost everything except the corn 
beans and coffee they grow must be hauled along the cable in a 
precarious iron gondola the gondola also is the only transport for 
a mother and sick child who must reach the provincial capital san 
francisco gotera 
the region along with the northern half of chalatenango province 
to the west is the zone hit hardest by a 10yearold civil war that 
has brutalized this small central american country 
rebels destroyed the bridge to hamper the movement of army 
troops soldiers have entered the area by helicopter since 
perquin is a guerrilla bastion 75 miles northeast of san 
salvador most of the 600 residents seem to support the farabundo 
marti national liberation front whose fighters can be found on 
street corners talking with townsfolk 
on the last sunday in may about 400 rebels mustered in the main 
square to hear a speech from the top guerrilla field commander 
with scores of villagers looking on several dozen fighters 
received shoulder patches distinguishing them for valor during and 
since the big rebel offensive in november 
the people of this town nestled among mistshrouded hills pray 
for the war to end strict limits are imposed on the amount of food 
each family may take north from the provincial capital each month 
medicine boots adult clothing and flashlight batteries there

the 1990 elections may not greatly increase the 
number of women in governors mansions and congress but female 
candidates hope to smash a symbolic barrier by winning the top jobs 
in texas and california 
democratic governor nominees ann richards in texas and dianne 
feinstein in california are the bright spots in a year that at 
best may bring incremental progress in electing more women to 
toplevel offices 
three women already are governors of smaller states but claiming 
control in major states like texas and california would break a 
big thick glass ceiling said sharon rodine president of the 
bipartisan national womens political caucus 
while numerical gains at the top are likely to be slim more 
women than ever are running for state legislatures statewide 
offices and congress according to the caucus these candidates are 
receiving tens of thousands of dollars from a growing number of 
groups promoting womens candidacies 
but all eyes and a good deal of money are on california and 
texas where the new governors will have a strong hand in the 
redistricting expected to add up to 10 new seats to their 
congressional delegations next year 
california and texas are key in terms of presidential politics 
and reapportionment said jane danowitz executive director of the 
bipartisan womens campaign fund these are not local posts we 
are talking about chief executive officers for two of the largest 
entities in the country 
the practical powerbroker aspects of feinstein and richards 
victories would be matched by their symbolic import many women say 
until we crack the stereotypical barrier of women as executives 
of major states we will not have a woman in the white house said 
wendy sherman executive director of the democratic emilys list 
which supports women candidates 
feinstein faces sen pete wilson in november and richards is up 
against oilmanrancher clayton williams both women survived 
bruising primaries and are considered viable contenders 
those women have been through tough ugly primaries and shown 
theyve got what it takes to hold those offices rodine said 
both of them are hungry for the job 
two women governors are retiring this year democrats madeleine 
kunin of vermont and rose mofford of arizona there are 11 others 
running for governor including republican kay orr who is up for 
reelection in nebraska 
in addition to feinstein and richards democrat barbara roberts 
in oregon is considered a strong contender for an open seat 
republican arliss sturgulewski of alaska will be in the same 
category if she wins her aug 28 primary 
republican barbara hafer of pennsylvania won her primary but has 
an uphill fight against popular democratic gov bob casey the other 
governor candidates all facing primaries are republican marlene 
woodsonhoward of florida democrat joan finney of kansas democrat 
evelyn murphy of massachusetts and republicans mary mead and nyla 
murphy who will face off in wyomings gop primary 
seven women are running for the senate which now counts two 
women among its 100 members sen nancy kassebaum rkan is up for 
reelection and sen barbara mukulski dmd comes up for 
reelection in 1992 
the one democratic woman making a senate bid this year josie 
heath of colorado is expected to win her party nomination but faces 
a formidable opponent in gop rep hank brown 
three gop women are quitting the house to run for senate reps 
claudine schneider of rhode island lynn martin of illinois and pat 
saiki of hawaii saiki is given the best shot at winning her 
democratic competitor is daniel akaka who recently was elevated 
from the house to the senate upon the death of democratic sen spark 
matsunaga 
schneider and martin are putting a scare into two entrenched 
democrats claiborne pell and paul simon 
longshot senate candidates are m jane brady a republican 
challenging sen joe biden ddel and republican christine todd 
whitman taking on sen bill bradley dnj 
there are 28 women in the 435member house including three 
certain departures by those running for the senate there also is 
speculation that rep lindy boggs dla whose daughter is very 
ill may retire this year 
in addition a few incumbent women in the house could be 
vulnerable among them democrats jill long of indiana and jolene 
unsoeld of washington 
on the plus side of the ledger california democrat maxine waters 
is a shooin to win the seat being vacated by retiring democratic 
rep augustus hawkins there are a number of strong candidates among 
the more than 50 women running for congress and analysts are 
predicting a net gain of up to four seats 
the most encouraging sign to rodine is the crowd of women running 
for statewide and state legislative offices that traditionally are 
jumpingoff points for governor and congressional races for 
example four women besides feinstein won nominations last week for 
statewide office in california 
many women are looking to 1992 as a watershed year that could 
break the pattern of incremental gains at the federal level 
redistricting will open up new opportunities for women in states 
gaining house seats and a large crop of incumbents is expected to 
retire because it will be the last year legislators can take their 
campaign war chests with them 
the caucus the campaign fund emilys list and the national 
federation of republican women all are offering money time and 
expertise to make sure prospective female candidates are prepared 
for 1992 with sophisticated fundraising and media techniques 
sherman said emilys list will help women in six to 10 states 
where new seats and retirements appear likely were going to take 
some risks in some places that wont pan out she said but we 
need to take those risks because this is the opportunity of the 
decade it wont come again for another 10 years

weak retail sales growth last month may have left stores with so 
much extra inventory that they will have to slash prices to clear 
out summer merchandise 
it will be good for the consumer said retail analyst monroe 
greenstein of bear stearns amp co 
many of the nations big general merchandisers discounters 
specialty and department stores posted disappointingly modest may 
sales gains on thursday retail executives said unseasonable weather 
discouraged shoppers 
abnormally cool temperatures and heavy rainfall particularly in 
the midwest and east kept customers from buying summer clothing and 
other seasonal merchandise such as air conditioners lawn mowers or 
outdoor furniture several analysts said 
but greenstein disputed the importance of the weather 
the poor weather may have played a role but i do not think it 
was the dominant factor greenstein said 
sales of apparel which have been the mainstay for retailers for 
more than a year lost momentum the slowing trend began in late 
april greenstein said 
it is the first sign of a slowdown for the industry he said 
adding that it indicates consumers have become more cautious about 
spending 
he said markdown activity is starting earlier than usual this 
season and price cuts may end up being deeper than retailers 
originally planned 
retailers typically start lowering price tags in midjune in an 
effort to empty their stores in preparation for shipments of 
backtoschool and fall merchandise 
several retailing executives acknowledged their may sales fell 
short of projections 
but k mart corp chairman and chief executive joseph e antonini 
said the discounters results were decent considering how much 
business was lost to bad weather 
the troy michbased nationwide chain posted a 104 percent may 
sales increase at all of its stores excluding stores opened within 
the past year however k marts sales were up a weaker 09 percent 
from a year earlier 
analysts consider results from stores open at least a year 
called same or comparablestore sales to be the best barometer of 
a retailers performance 
sears roebuck and co also posted a meager 09 percent gain in 
its samestore sales the chicagobased giant said total sales for 
the four weeks ended june 3 also edged up 09 percent from last year 
walmart stores inc outperformed its competitors as usual 
analysts say walmart could overtake its bigger rivals in terms of 
national sales volume as soon as this year k mart currently is 
ranked second after sears 
walmart headquartered in bentonville ark said its may sales 
jumped 24 percent from the year earlier level and when measured on 
a comparablestore basis sales still managed a doubledigit gain 
rising 11 percent 
some retailers had mixed news good sales growth in an individual 
division or two but poor results in another such was the case for 
dayton hudson corp a minneapolisbased retailer that operates the 
target discount chain mervyns and department stores 
chairman kenneth a macke said business at target and mervyns 
held up well while the companys department stores had a decline in 
samestore sales 
we would be happy to have a good warm spell to increase sales 
of swim suits and other warm weather items macke said 
dayton hudson posted a 79 percent increase in the four weeks 
ended june 2 from a year before sales at stores open at least a 
year rose 42 percent 
the retailers results differ from the monthly retail sales 
report issued by the commerce department the governments report is 
more comprehensive and includes sales at auto dealerships and other 
retail establishments the government focuses on monthtomonth 
changes while the retailers measure their performance against the 
previous years pace 
other retailers reporting thursday included 
woolworth corp said total domestic sales in the four weeks to 
june 2 rose 61 percent from last year and samestore sales grew 3 
percent 
among department store operators 
may department stores co reported a 9 percent sales increase 
for the four weeks samestore sales for the st louisbased 
retailer rose 4 percent 
jc penney co inc of dallas posted a 23 percent increase

lee iacocca will stay in the drivers seat at 
chrysler corp after his contract expires next year but the 
question of his eventual successor will continue to loom large over 
the nations no 3 automaker 
the line to the chairmans office was disrupted last week when 
iacoccas heir apparent gerald greenwald resigned as vice chairman 
the succession issue has heated up at a time when chryslers 
sales and earnings are under the most pressure since the company 
came back from the brink of bankruptcy a decade ago 
right now theres a battle raging and im not going to leave 
my troops in the field iacocca said in a statement released 
thursday after a chrysler board meeting in new york we have 
mutually agreed that my employment will be extended past december of 
1991 
just how long the 65yearold iacocca will continue as chairman 
and chief executive officer and how much he will be paid isnt 
known chrysler spokesman ac liebler said 
iacocca is probably the single most important element ot 
chrysler corporation said alan helfman general manager of river 
oaks chryslerplymouth in houston he sells the sizzle and people 
like the showmanship 
that will be a tough act to follow helfman said 
one of my prime responsibilities is to put an orderly 
succession plan in place iacocca said were going to do that 
according to our own timetable and it wont be driven by a big x on 
the calendar 
greenwald was told by iacocca about a year ago that chryslers 
chairmanship was yours to lose greenwald chose to lose it 
opting instead to head a threeunion effort to buy the parent of 
united airlines for 454 billion 
analyst mary anne sudol of fitch investors service inc said 
iacocca probably would stay at the helm for no more than two extra 
years as a stopgap 
i tend to think it the extension is to give the board time 
and the contenders the opportunity to establish their own track 
records she said 
less than 24 hours after greenwalds resignation chrysler said 
robert s miller the companys chief financial officer would take 
over greenwalds title and most of his duties chrysler motors 
president robert lutz got the rest of the duties but no new title 
the changes prompted speculation that iacocca might stay on after 
his contract expires dec 8 1991 neither miller 48 nor lutz 58 
appeared ready to become chairman in 18 months 
greenwald was the highest ranking of three executives who 
announced their resignations in may michael hammes resigned as vice 
president for international operations to head up hand tool 
operations at black amp decker and treasurer frederick zuckerman said 
he will quit sometime this summer 
chrysler has been thinning its executive ranks since last 
october when it started a 15 billion costcutting program that 
will reduce the whitecollar work force by more than 2500 people 
the company reported an 80 percent drop in firstquarter earnings 
to 71 million analysts dont expect an upturn until at least the 
fourth quarter 
earnings have been pressured by a dive in the companys car and 
truck sales through the first five months of this year sales were 
running nearly 13 percent below last years pace 
iacocca signed a fouryear contract with the automaker in 1987 
he joined chrysler in 1979 after being fired as president of ford 
motor co by the late henry ford ii 
iacoccas most lucrative year as chairman was in 1986 when he 
received 205 million in compensation his average annual 
compensation since 1985 was 115 million he received 4 million 
for last year 
the companys 1990 proxy statement says iacocca will receive 
191250 shares of chrysler stock this coming nov 2 and another 
63750 shares after dec 8 1991 
at 16 a share chryslers common stock price at midday thursday 
the stock would have a combined value of 41 million

the government spent 158 billion trying to hold 
down the dollars rise against the japanese yen from february 
through april the federal reserve reported 
still the dollar increased 10 percent against the yen during the 
period the fed said in its quarterly report to congress the rise 
began to subside only when currency traders started to believe 
japanese interest rates did not need to climb further and when 
japans stock and bond markets became more settled the fed said 
the government used 200 million to buy west german marks to 
bring its total currency market intervention for the period to 178 
billion the dollar declined less than 05 percent against the mark 
in the three months 
in the previous three months the government spent 750 million 
intervening in currency markets all of it to buy yen 
although purchases more than doubled in the latest quarter it 
was far far lower than pervious periods last year said sam y 
cross a fed executive vice president who released the report at a 
press conference 
the government spent a record 1192 billion in the foreign 
exchange market during the three months ended july 31 and 5871 
billion in augustoctober period the government purchased both yen 
and west german marks during those periods 
in the latest period the dollar saw its steepest climb against 
the yen from late february through early april the climb subsided 
as the market awaited the april 7 meeting of finanical officials 
from governments of the worlds seven leading industrial nations 
the fed said 
also in april market participants came to view the bank of 
japans 1 percent increase in the discount rate as being sufficient 
to stop the yens slide and japans stock and bond markets began to 
recoup some of their losses according to the report 
the yens weakness against the dollar helped trigger a slide of 
more than 25 percent on the tokyo stock market early this year 
the dollar was at its low of the period on feb 19 at 1436 yen 
but the dollar began to rally after election victories for japans 
liberal democratic party and predictions of higher interest rates 
elsewhere in the world the government sold 650 million to buy yen 
between feb 23 and march 2 
also the dollar strengthened against the mark amid fears of 
inflation resulting from the pending currency union between east and 
west germany the dollar reached 17237 marks on march 1 
between march 5 and march 27 the treasury sold 830 million to 
buy yen and 200 million was sold for marks the purchases were made 
by the us treasury as the fed temporarily put its intervention 
program on hold the fed and treasury normally split the funds used 
for intervention 
the temporary halt came after some fed officials said they were 
concerned that high amounts of purchases like those in 1989 could 
cause doubts about the feds commitment to curbing inflation 
according to the report the governments currency intervention 
exacerbate inflation by increase the supply of dollars

the story of beatrice co resembles the rise and 
fall of an empire the conglomerate was built up slowly bit by bit 
then dismantled in much the same manner and the spoils of war made 
great fortunes along the way 
the last piece of the company disappeared thursday as conagra 
inc bought beatrices remaining food operations for 134 billion 
it was the endgame of a decade of corporate pacman 
the sale also marked the last chapter in the 61 billion 
leveraged buyout of beatrice engineered by kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co and businessman donald kelly who went on to serve as beatrices 
chairman 
after acquiring the conglomerate in 1985 kelly and kohlberg 
kravis began systematically stripping away its assets at a 
handsome profit for themselves and other investors 
back in the early 1980s beatrice was a food and consumer 
products company with several big brands in its portfolio including 
la choy oriental foods samsonite luggage tropicana orange juice 
and stp auto products 
led by thenchairman james l dutt the company had grown big 
through acquisitions but the nature of its businesses 
highprofile consumer brands that generated lots of cash left it 
vulnerable to a breakup 
in 1984 beatrice set its sights on esmark inc the acquisition 
that proved its undoing 
esmark had started out in business as swift amp co the 
meatpacker but esmark was also acquisitionminded and in 1983 it 
had paid 973 million for norton simon inc another conglomerate 
the purchase of norton simon gave esmark such wellknown brands 
as huntwesson foods max factor cosmetics playtex underwear swift 
and eckrich meats and the avis car rental company 
in may 1984 10 months after buying norton simon kohlberg kravis 
and kelly then chairman of esmark offered to take the company 
private for 24 billion dutt topped the bid and beatrice won the 
firm for 27 billion 
to pay for esmark beatrice began to pare assets saying it would 
sell avis danskin clothing international jensen electronics 
equipment and its cookie food service equipment agriproducts and 
leather businesses 
but beatrice proved unable to handle the financial and corporate 
burdens of the acquisition it led to management turmoil and a drop 
in profits and eventually to the ouster of dutt in august 1985 
two months later kohlberg kravis reappeared again with the 
support of kelly who had quit esmark after its buyout they 
swallowed beatrice for 61 billion 
the breakup of beatrice then began in earnest 
in the late 1980s under kellys leadership beatrice sold off 
some 7 billion in assets several were then turned around and sold 
once again 
among them 
avis was sold to its senior management and the investor group 
wesray capital corp for 16 billion in 1986 a year later wesray 
sold the car rental firm to its employees for 175 billion 
the companys cocacola bottling businesses were sold to the 
cocacola co for 1 billion in 1986 the businesses were combined 
with cokes other bottling operations under a separate company 
cocacola enterprises inc and 51 percent of the firm was spun off 
to the public 
the playtex consumer products and apparel businesses went 
private in 1986 in a managementled lbo for 125 billion playtex 
later sold its family products division to johnson amp johnson co for 
726 million 
beatrices international operations was bought by tlc group lp 
for 985 million in 1987 and renamed tlc beatrice international inc 
the following year tlc sold the companys latin american operations 
for more than 100 million 
tropicana products inc went for 12 billion to seagram co 
ltd in 1988 
kelly also spun off beatrices specialty food and nonfood 
businesses such as samsonite luggage culligan water treatment 
systems and stiffel lamps in a 192 billion public stock and debt 
offering the new company eii holdings inc was intended to be a 
vehicle for more acquisitions by the company 
eii lived up to expectations launching an attack on american 
brands inc in december 1987 but american brands turned the tables 
on eii and acquired the aggressor for 27 billion two months 
later 
with these and other divestitures there remained beatrices core 
food business brands including hunts wesson manwich peter pan 
snack pak swiss miss la choy swift premium butterball eckrich 
and reddiwip

securities and exchange commisson chairman 
richard c breeden is taking his message of international 
cooperation among stock market regulators on the road again to 
luxembourg germany and hungary 
the head of the federal agency that regulates stocks bonds and 
other securities said thursday hell travel to europe later this 
month to sign an international cooperation agreement in luxembourg 
and help reopen the long dormant budapest stock exchange 
he also said an advisory committee on east european markets 
representing some of the best and the brightest on wall street 
will hold its first meeting in washington next week to discuss ways 
of helping the infant free market economies of former iron curtain 
countries 
since taking office last october breeden has traveled to japan 
france and the netherlands to hammer out cooperation agreements with 
foreign securities regulators 
highlevel officials from the soviet union hungary and poland 
have visited sec headquarters in washington some delegations more 
than once 
together the countries of eastern europe and the soviet union 
represent a potential market of 400 million people breeden said 
in a speech to the new york financial writers association helping 
these countries create free economic markets is the right thing to 
do he added 
in addition to helping the budapest stock market celebrate its 
reopening june 21 after 42 years in limbo under communist rule 
breeden said he expected to sign an assistance agreement with 
hungarian government on securities matters 
he said the sec also was working on new agreements with mexico 
australia israel and several other countries 
in other matters breeden defended proposed legislation to give 
the sec control of stock index futures he rebutted congressional 
criticism that the bill unveiled by the bush administration earlier 
this week is riddled with loopholes that would hinder rather than 
assist investor protection 
breeden also said he believed there was still time in the 
dwindling congressional session to get the controversial legislation 
enacted 
critics have said the proposal to take regulation of stock index 
futures away from the commodity futures trading commission and give 
it to the sec would open the flood gates to deregulated trading 
because of vague legislative language 
the cftc and the sec have battled publicly over which agency 
should oversee financial products that have elements of both a 
security and a futures contract such hybrid products include stock 
index futures which allow investors to speculate on movements in 
the stock market without having to buy the stocks themselves 
the administrations plan for ending the turf battle would 
unify regulation under the sec of the one market of stocks 
stock options and stock index futures according to the treasury 
department 
but sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee which oversees the cftc said wednesday the proposal was 
riddled with loopholes and legal inconsistencies that could 
result in massive deregulation 
im not aware of any loopholes breeden told reporters before 
his speech 
breeden who has often complained about the split in regulatory 
authority over new financial products maintained that the proposed 
legislation would decrease instability and protect investors from 
stock market gyrations 
some washington officials have suggested there may not be enough 
time to get such a controversial piece of legislation approved 
before congress adjourns for the year on oct 5 
i dont think time is necessarily a problem said breeden 
adding that the issue already has been thoroughly explored and 
debated in numerous committee hearings

conagra incs 134 billion purchase of 
beatrice co closed out one of the key leveraged buyouts of the 
1980s at a big profit and established conagra as a leading us food 
company for the 90s 
this will put conagra at roughly 20 billion in annual 
sales said stephen carnes an analyst with piper jaffray amp 
hopwood in minneapolis 
it consolidates the food industry even further said john 
mcmillin an analyst with prudentialbache securities in new york 
conagra would rank as one of the worlds biggest food companies 
along with nestle of switzerland the anglodutch giant unilever and 
new yorkbased philip morris mcmillin said 
conagra will acquire beatrice for cash and stock valued at 134 
billion the deal announced thursday will unite some of the 
countrys bestknown food brands on a single corporate shelf 
conagra generated more than 15 billion in sales in the year 
ended may 27 by processing grain selling farm products such as 
fertilizer and animal feed and marketing prepared foods its food 
brands includes healthy choice banquet armour classics morton 
chun king and kids cuisine frozen foods armour processed meats and 
country pride chicken products 
beatrice had 43 billion in sales in its most recent year with 
brands such as hunts wesson orville redenbachers manwich peter 
pan snack pak swiss miss la choy swift premium butterball 
eckrich and reddiwip 
we believe conagra and beatrice together will be the best food 
company in the united states chairman charles m harper said at a 
news conference at conagras omaha headquarters 
one of conagras most important longterm objectives has been 
to establish a strong sales and distribution system to the 
shelfstable section of the grocery store he said referring to 
food products that dont require refrigeration beatrice will 
fulfill that objective 
the deal which is subject to approval by federal regulators was 
announced after the close of trading on the new york stock exchange 
where conagras stock rose 75 cents to 32 a share 
the sale completes kohlberg kravis roberts amp cos divestiture of 
beatrice a classic assetstripping exercise that pocketed huge 
profits for the new york buyout firm and its other investors 
kkr purchased beatrice then a major foods and consumer products 
conglomerate in a 61 billion leveraged buyout in 1986 in 
subsequent years beatrice sold off avis rentacar a cocacola 
bottler tropicana products inc and other prominent brands the 
food businesses sold to conagra were all that remained 
investors who put 420 million of equity into kkrs beatrice 
buyout reaped a total of about 22 billion from the selloff of its 
businesses representing a compound annual rate of return of more 
than 50 percent the buyout firm said 
under terms of the sale conagra will buy beatrice for 1150 a 
share from kkr partnerships and management investors the purchase 
price consists of approximately 626 million in cash 355 million 
in conagra common stock and 355 million in two series of conagra 
preferred stock 
harper said the acquisition would have no immediate effect on 
employment at beatrice or conagra there also are no plans to move 
executives from beatrices chicago office or to phase out the 
beatrice name he said 
our whole company is trying to manage them beatrice as 
independent operating companies harper said 
consumers will see no immediated changes he said but added i 
think there will probably be more new products introduced over time 
that fit consumers needs and improve their quality of life 
beatrice reported earnings of 12 million on sales of 426 
billion in the year ended feb 28 conagra is expected to report 
earnings for its fiscal year ended may 27 later this month

a 1 billion deal with the soviet unions largest 
automaker may pave general motors corps way to more lucrative 
contracts in that country vice president william hoglund said 
as president gorbachev said last week and as we have felt for a 
very long time if you ever want to play in that market you have 
to start someplace hoglund said at a news conference at gm 
headquarters 
he was referring to the soviet leaders comment to bankers 
industrialists and manufacturers five days earlier in minneapolis 
those who dont want to risk their dollars will remain observers 
for years to come 
under the fiveyear agreement signed thursday at volga auto works 
in togliatti 700 miles east of moscow gm will supply volga with 
engine emissioncontrol systems the first components would be 
shipped in 1992 for volgas lada cars 
the contract marks the first automotive deal between a us and 
soviet company since the great depression ford motor co last year 
pulled out of joint venture talks with soviet companies chrysler 
corp has no dealings in the soviet union 
it does provide a very good foundation from which start to 
learn how to do business there learn how to find hotel rooms and 
make telephone calls hoglund said 
world automakers have been looking actively for business in 
eastern europe as a result of recent political and economic changes 
gm already has announced vehicle manufacturing deals in hungary and 
east germany 
the technology gm will supply volga will enable the company to 
meet current or expected worldwide emission standards and export 
ladas to pollutionconscious europe and other markets hoglund said 
gm systems would make lada engines cleanerrunning and more fuel 
efficient hoglund said and provide massive improvements to 
driveability 
gm will supply 100000 to 150000 enginecontrol systems a year 
to volga not a vast number compared with its capability of making 
more than 5 million systems a year for the us market he said 
gm is to be paid in dollars assuming volga can export enough 
cars to raise the hard currency this as a proportion of our total 
enginemanagement system business is a reasonably small risk he 
said 
components gm will supply include enginecontrol computer 
modules fuel injection systems ignition parts wiring and 
catalytic converters the first batches will be made by gm in the 
united states and europe the components make up the bulk of the 1 
billion deal hoglund said 
gm also will do engineering work at its european technical center 
in bascharage luxembourg on how the systems are to be adapted to 
15 liter and 17 liter lada engines he said the company also will 
train soviets in the use of the systems he said 
gm and volga said they also will discuss forming a joint venture 
to manufacture catalytic converters in the soviet union 
that could give gm a valuable source of the costly platinum and 
platinumbased elements used in the converters materials found 
chiefly in the soviet union and south africa hoglund said 
last february gms allison gas turbine division said it had 
signed a deal to supply up to 100 helicopter engines to the soviet 
union beginning in 1992 that agreement could be worth 50 million 
to 100 million during the 1990s officials have said

creditors have spurned drexel burnham lambert 
group incs bankruptcy reorganization proposal and are pursuing 
their own plan that would oust the management of the collapsed wall 
street firm 
the committee representing drexels creditors decided thursday to 
reject drexels plan for emerging from chapter 11 protection 
the previous day drexel proposed to pay creditors 100 cents on 
the dollar in part by giving them a share of the companys holdings 
of junk bonds and other illiquid investments valued by the firm at 
about 2 billion 
drexel has asked for a 120day extension of a deadline set for 
wednesday giving it the exclusive right to file a reorganization 
plan but the creditors said they would asked us bankruptcy judge 
howard c buschman iii for permission to file their own plan 
the company filed for bankruptcy protection in february and its 
brokerage subsidiary drexel burnham lambert inc followed suit 
last week drexel plans to emerge from bankruptcy court as an 
operating entity although it is unclear what shape the firm would 
take 
creditors said they were dissatisfied with drexels proposal that 
would keep management in control as the company liquidates assets 
they also said a plan to repay creditors of most subsidiaries with 
cash and creditors of the parent company with notes backed by 
drexels assets was unacceptable 
drexel management was a problem of consequence but certainly 
the plan they proposed wasnt in any manner sufficient said 
sylvan schefler a former drexel managing director who is 
representing former employees on the committee 
the creditors proposal would substantively consolidate the 
parent company and its major subsidiaries and provide for 100 
percent recovery to creditors within three years 
it also would create a new board of directors and new management 
for drexel the creditors said debt instruments and common and 
preferred stock would be created under their plan that could be 
traded publicly 
under drexels proposal the firm would create a separate 
business entity out of its investments creditors would receive 
promissory notes valued at the amount of their individual claims and 
backed by drexels assets the notes would be paid off as drexels 
assets are liquidated drexels attorneys said the firm would manage 
the portfolio 
the creditors panel said its plan also would ask the bankruptcy 
court to estimate the amount of drexels liability in more than 400 
lawsuits which seek damages for the firms trading activity 
a separate litigation trust would be formed to handle potential 
claims against recipients of some 260 million in bonuses drexel 
paid out in the months before it filed for bankruptcy protection 
the committee said 
drexel rose to power in the 1980s by dominating the highyield 
bond business but failed to recover from a government securities 
fraud investigation the firm last year pleaded guilty to six 
felonies and agreed to pay 650 million to settle insider trading 
and other allegations

scientists studying a disease affecting citrus 
fruit inadvertently discovered two antibiotics that might be used to 
treat staph infection among humans the agriculture department says 
staph bacteria became resistant to earlier antibiotics and are 
beginning to resist the current method of treatment 
in lab tests the new potent antibiotics stopped the growth of 
staph bacteria said robert a baker a chemist with usdas 
agricultural research service 
he and retired colleague james tatum discovered the compounds 
after fermenting the soilborne fungus fusarium solani in vats 
we werent really looking for the antibiotics said baker 
we were trying to establish a relationship between the soil fungus 
and a citrus disease 
he said the antibiotics can be easily isolated from fermentation 
broths 
about 20 percent to 40 percent of all adults intermittently carry 
staph bacteria on their skin in their nose or on their clothes 
said dr mary young of georgetown university medical centers 
division of infectious diseases here 
if a carrier gets an abrasion or cut the bacteria can attack not 
only the surface skin cells but also enter the body and cause even 
more serious problems she said 
the staph organism quickly becomes resistant to antibiotics by 
producing an enzyme that renders the antibiotic ineffective young 
said 
baker said he thinks his discovery can be effective against 
staph but such testing would have to be done by pharmaceutical 
companies

three new varieties of sweet potatoes with 
builtin defenses against insects have been developed by agriculture 
department scientists 
most sweet potatoes have skins that naturally provide some 
resistance to insects and nematodes but few have the level of 
resistance of these new varieties said scientists at the 
charleston sc vegetable lab of usdas agricultural research 
service 
the new sweet potato varieties are called regal southern delite 
and excel 
resistance in excel amounts to 80 percent control of soil 
insects 75 percent of the sweet potato flea beetle and 92 percent 
of the white grub said plant geneticist alfred jones thats 
control you just cannot achieve with the presently recommended 
chemical treatments 
jones said excel the newest of the varieties has unsually strong 
resistance to seven common soil insect pests in field tests the 
southern potato wireworm tobacco wireworm banded cucumber beetle 
spotted cucumber beetle elongated flea beetle palestriped flea 
beetle and sweet potato flea beetle 
on test plots the new varieties produced more marketable 
potatoes without insecticide than did jewel when it was sprayed 
regularly with insecticide usda said

universal studios florida wants its new 630 
million theme park to prove it can compete worldwide with 
entertainment giant walt disney world but first there are some bugs 
to be worked out 
glitches on a glitzy opening day thursday at the combination film 
production center and tourist park closed several of the heavily 
publicized rides including kongfrontation featuring king kong 
and long lines formed throughout what sidney sheinberg president 
of universal parent mca inc calls his swampland into a 
dreamland the 444acre rival to walt disney cos dominance 
among the 13 million annual visitors to central florida 
i have never been so mad in my entire life said visitor 
denise mcdonald of toronto im so ticked off 
because of the difficulties all patrons today were to receive a 
free pass with no expiration date 
but sheinberg was optimistic 
universal studios is the prototype of the studio and visitor 
attraction we hope to build in europe and the orient and some day in 
other locations around the globe he told openingday guests 
mcas recreation services division will be a major segment of 
our future second to none of our other businesses sheinberg said 
the 338billion entertainment conglomerate has relied on its 
filmed entertainment and music operations for up to threefourths of 
its annual revenue 
up to now recreation services primarily has been involved with 
mcas universal studio tour in california and concession operations 
for yosemite national park industry observers say 
walt disney co operates three orlandoarea theme parks 
including the yearold disneymgm studios 
universal studios florida is a joint venture of mca and the rank 
organization plc of london ranks chairman sir patrick meaney 
said france and england are enthusiastic about proposals to build a 
new theme park in their countries 
sheinberg said he hoped to announce a european site within two or 
three months mca also has indicated interest in building a studio 
park in japan with nippon steel 
but operational problems plagued the muchheralded opening of the 
florida park 
the sixstory tall kongfrontation sound stage was closed 
because the 6ton steelandfur monster could go through its 
computeractivated terror routines only in stages a program that 
melds all the segments into one smooth performance was inoperative 
a company spokesman said 
a recreation of a san francisco earthquake for passengers aboard 
a subway train operated only partially actor charlton heston became 
the main attraction at that site 
he was joined by celebrities michael j fox bill cosby linda 
blair jimmy stewart ernest borgnine sissy spacek and dozens of 
other stars flown in from hollywood and new york by chartered plane 
and train 
robert wagner master of ceremonies for the inaugural ceremonies 
directed the sealing of a 25year time capsule of universal studios 
memorabilia director steven spielberg cut a ribbon before visitors 
poured in 
universal studios florida has a capacity of about 40000 but 
officials have said attendance would be held below 20000 if 
necessary for the first few weeks until a shakedown is completed 
universal hopes to attract about 5 million visitors in its first 
year jay stein president of recreation services told reporters

private businesses universities and government 
agencies are teaming up to develop an advanced computer network that 
would transmit data 700 times faster than currently possible the 
new york times reported today 
the project is expected to be announced later today by the 
national science foundation based in washington dc 
the highspeed computer network would enable the transmission of 
1 billion bits of computer data per second via fiberoptic cables 
currently used for telephone service 
government laboratories at los alamos nm and livermore 
calif will participate in what would be the first comprehensive 
effort in the united states to advance the technologically critical 
area of computer networks the newspaper said 
dozens of corporations including ibm atampt mci and the 
regional bell companies and such universities as the massachusetts 
institute of technology the university of pennsylvania the 
california institute of technology and the university of california 
at berkeley will participate it said 
the network might be used to link computers and televisions to 
allow users to manipulate images on screen and transmit them to 
other users within seconds 
another use would be threedimensional medical imaging that would 
allow doctors thousands of miles away to simultaneously analyze 
lifelike images 
weather forecasting would improve because supercomputers 
throughout the country would be linked and business trips could be 
eliminated in favor of multimedia teleconferencing 
several technological challenges confront the project such as 
the need to develop a new class of computers to keep up with the new 
data highways 
the network will be set in motion with a 15 million grant from 
the national science foundation and the pentagon and more than 100 
million from the computer and communications companies the times 
reported 
other recent cooperative technological projects have failed 
because of lack of money or enthusiasm among government and 
industry they include us memories a joint governmentindustry 
project that would have strengthened us semiconductor businesses 
in japan the government and large corporations have already 
begun work on developing data highways

the senate is moving toward reimposing price 
restraints on cable television six years after it decided to lift 
controls on a younger less powerful cable tv industry 
faced with rising constituent complaints about prices and 
service the senate commerce science and transportation committee 
on thursday approved a bill that would allow local governments to 
control some cable tv prices 
this is a major victory for the american public sen john 
danforth rmo said following the 181 vote millions of 
subscribers are fed up with high prices and who cares service the 
message is that help is on the way 
we oppose the bill but we recognize too that it is a 
significant improvement over the original staff draft said john 
wolfe spokesman for the national cable television association 
the association was concerned over lastminute changes on how 
cable must deal with competitive distributors such as satellites and 
wireless cable trying to acquire cable programming 
james mooney president of the association said his group also 
was concerned about provisions ordering the federal communications 
commission to consider limits on the number of cable systems one 
company may own and the number of channels that may be occupied by a 
programmer in which the cable operator has an interest 
mooney said that while his group would work to effect a 
reasonable bill in congress we cannot accept legislation that 
hampers the ability of our industry to continue to grow and to 
serve our subscribers 
thursdays vote marked the first time lawmakers have moved to 
restore some of the regulation of the cable industry that congress 
lifted in the 1984 cable act 
the 1984 law ended local rate regulation effective in 1987 and 
since then cable prices have risen dramatically 
prospects for the bills passage in the full senate were unclear 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher wrote danforth and committee 
chairman sen ernest f hollings dsc that the administration 
opposed the bill because it emphasized regulation at the expense of 
trying to improve competition in the cable industry 
the cable industry also vowed to fight any attempt to amend the 
legislation to allow telephone companies into the cable business 
sen conrad burns rmont agreed to withdraw an amendment 
thursday that would have allowed nonbell telephone companies to own 
cable tv programming after he was assured the committee would vote 
on a separate bill before the cable measure goes to the senate floor 
several cable reregulation proposals also are pending in the 
house and may be voted on by the house energy and commerce 
telecommunications subcommittee by the end of the month 
the senate bill among other things would 
allow local governments to regulate prices for a basic tier 
of channels including local overtheair broadcast channels 
adsupported pay cable channels such as espn cnn and mtv would not 
be subject to local rate regulation however if local authorities 
or a subscriber complains about rate increases for such adsupported 
cable channels the fcc could establish reasonable rates if it 
finds them to be excessive 
require cable operators not to discriminate against cable 
programmers such as movie channels with which they have no 
affiliation some cable companies are owned by giant conglomerates 
that also own movie channels 
require that all cable programmers make their programming 
available to owners of home satellite dishes

the first woman to serve as executive director of 
the american bar association is resigning amid mixed reviews ending 
a sometimes stormy threeyear tenure 
jill winebanks a 47yearold former watergate prosecutor 
submitted her resignation thursday to l stanley chauvin jr 
president of the 360000member bar she was hired in august 1987 
for the post which now pays 225000 a year 
although my tenure at the american bar association has been an 
exciting and challenging time i am now eager and ready to move on 
to explore several other exciting opportunities awaiting me 
winebanks wrote 
chauvin credited winebanks with streamlining the bar 
associations bureaucracy reforming its budget process and putting 
into effect the first longrange plan the association ever had 
and she broadened the associations appeal to women minorites 
younger people chauvin said 
others welcomed her departure 
frankly the mainstream of the abas membership will applaud 
this change said former aba president eugene thomas the 
leadership sets the tone and we want someone who sets a different 
one 
winebanks drew unwanted attention last year when news stories 
suggested that she had used her political clout to seek disciplinary 
charges against a veterinarian for mistreating her dalmatian who 
died after eating a tampon 
she said she had the right to complain about mell wostoupal who 
eventually was suspended for 45 days from practice 
at the time thomas wrote a letter to bar association leaders 
calling for winebanks resignation saying she does not 
understand the use of power and lacks a sense of decorum and 
propriety in professional matters 
at a closeddoor meeting last year the board of governors 
decided not to fire her 
winebanks also was criticized for wasting the associations 
money when she traveled to and from work in a limousine equipped 
with a television chauvin said she opted for renting the limo 
because it was cheaper than the cost of a car which the association 
had agreed to buy her 
she called the charges that she misused her power total 
baloney 
the people i admire and respect felt very positively about my 
performance and thats what matters to me winebanks said 
george bushnell jr head of the bars house of delegates said 
winebanks was criticized because of culture shock 
the aba has until the last five years been an organization of 
staid and conservative male lawyers bushnell said jill was 
neither staid nor conservative nor male she caused a lot of 
discomfort simply because she represented radical change

takeover strategist carl c icahn said he would 
continue his battle to increase the value of usx corp stock despite 
shareholders rejection of his plan to spin off the companys steel 
division 
we have a number of options that were exploring icahn said 
thursday we have no definite plans but we are going to continue 
to be very involved as far as what is happening 
usx said thursday preliminary results of the vote count show 
about 571 percent of shareholders representing about 999 million 
shares rejected the proposal while 429 percent representing 
about 75 million shares voted for it 
icahn usxs largest shareholder with a 133 percent stake holds 
about 339 million of the shares cast for the proposal the company 
said 
usx chairman charles a corry said the vote meant shareholders 
have decisively supported our policy of well considered and 
prudent corporate change 
management is dedicated to improving the corporations 
operations and financial position he said corporate 
restructuring will continue as opportunities arise and when it is in 
the best interest of all of our shareholders 
greg drahuschak a steel analyst with butcher amp singer in 
pittsburgh said icahns failure to gain the support of even a 
simple majority signaled sound rejection of his plan 
the management has been in the drivers seat ever since icahn 
stepped in the door and they knew it drahuschak said down the 
line some of icahns ideas are going to happen but in managements 
time 
icahn explained the loss by saying a few institutional investors 
sided with usx management even though they agreed with his spinoff 
plan icahn said the institutions told him they received indications 
from management they would undertake a meaningful restructuring 
soon 
shareholders voted on the nonbinding proposal at the companys 
annual meeting in findlay ohio on may 7 exactly one month before 
the results were announced 
icahn proposed spinning off at least 80 percent of the companys 
steel division in the form of a dividend to shareholders contending 
the move would boost usxs stock 
icahn contends the relatively weak steel business is depressing 
usxs stock price and is a potential drag on the company if the

european community environment ministers friday 
agreed to fix 1997 as the deadline for eliminating the manufacture 
and use within the community of a gas that destroys the earths 
protective ozone layer 
they also said they would negotiate with other countries to 
enforce a total international ban on chlorofluorocarbons between by 
2000 
although the decision does not yet have the force of law in the 
12nation ec a spokesman for the ecs executive commission said a 
law would be adopted by the end of this year 
the law would mean that ec industries that use 
chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs as a cooling agent or as an aerosol 
component would have to use alternative technologies 
the ministers also decided to try at a meeting on the montreal 
protocol in london later this month to forge an international 
agreement to end worldwide use of cfcs by the year 2000 
the montreal protocol signed by 40 nations in 1987 agrees to 
cut the use of cfcs in half by 1998 
large developing nations like india china mexico and brazil 
have not signed the protocol arguing that it would cost them too 
much money to introduce new technologies they said they would need 
230 million in an international fund in order to develop 
alternative technologies 
diplomatic sources said the commission would likely suggest the 
creation of such a fund at the london meeting 
sources also said the netherlands italy west germany and france 
strongly backed the idea of raising money for the fund by taxing 
both manufacturers and users of cfcs

a 267mile route near tokyo has been picked as the 
site for a 23 billion test track for a superfast magnetically 
levitated linear train the transportation ministry said friday 
the firstphase of construction on the 343mph system will start 
later this year for completion by late 1994 following a threeyear 
test period the railway will go into business by the end of 1997 
officials said 
the test track linking sakaigawamura and akiyamamura in 
yamanashi prefecture northwest of tokyo could become part of a 
tokyonagoya or a tokyoosaka maglev railway officials added 
nagoya is 169 miles west of tokyo while osaka is 255 miles west of 
tokyo 
japan began searching in 1962 for ways to apply superconductive 
materials which carry electricity without any resistance to 
building a commercial version of a highspeed train that floats 
above its tracks 
in 1988 researchers at the railway technical research institute 
set a record of 321 mph then a world record on a 4mile test 
track near miyazaki city so far about 302 million has been spent 
on developing the system the government said 
the train is guided by a magnetic field instead of by rigid 
rails the trains powerful superconducting magnets suspend it 4 
inches above hundreds of oppositely charged metal coils set in the 
base of its ushaped guideway they also keep the train centered in 
the guideway and propel it forward through attraction to 
electromagnets along the guideways walls 
in the united states a bill introduced in congress in april 
would spend 350 million over three years to develop a magnetic 
levitation system that would whisk passengers between major us 
cities in streamlined capsules 
the 300mph us system is aimed at competing with the highspeed 
transportation systems under development in japan and germany

embittered us business leaders told congress 
japanese companies copy their designs then with the help of the 
japanese government push the us firm out of the market 
we are in a trade war with japan that the japanese are 
equipped to win through miti the ministry of international trade 
and industry edgar otto head of therma systems inc of 
plainfield new jersey told the congressional task force on 
technology transfer thursday 
otto said his companys insulated thermal trays for serving 
food hot to hospital patients revolutionized an antiquated serving 
system in japan after five years of success his japanese 
distributor with the excuse that the us trays were declining in 
quality abrubtly switched to an affiliated japanese supplier it had 
quietly commissioned to copy his design otto said 
nancy h chasen of rockville maryland said after initial 
success her high technology firm fusions corp collided directly 
with a massive structural barrier in the form of the japanese patent 
system 
long waiting periods for patent approval coupled with the 
practice of quickly making applications public invites behavior that 
in the united states would be regarded as fraud or piracy she said 
yet the japanese patent fraud statute has never been enforced 
and predatory companies feel free to target promising technologies 
and to file for patents derived from the products of others she 
added 
ms chasen said us negotiators in the yearold structural 
impediment talks with japan should insist on meaningful 
intellectual property rights provisions persuading the japanese 
to upgrade their system to the standard of those in the us and 
europe 
ken w cole vice president of allied signal inc of morristown 
nj said his aerospace and engineering firm filed an unfair 
practices complaint last march with the us trade representative 
he said miti organized and helped fund a 34corporation group 
that told allied to license its property rights for power 
transformers at a low price or else to stay out of japan he 
said allied was told no one would buy from them if they didnt cut 
the license price 
cole described it as a classic case of the japanese 
government targeting an advanced technology for development by its 
own industries

for bondholders of donald trumps three atlantic 
city casinos the gambling doesnt stop at the tables 
news that bankers were in negotiations with the eponymous 
developer and might seek to force him to sell assets sent prices of 
the casino bonds plunging early last week 
junk bonds backed by the taj mahal the new billiondollar resort 
that some analysts consider the shakiest leg of the trump empire 
lost 10 percent of their face value in one day alone 
although they ended the week well off their lows the 14 percent 
bonds still traded at less than 60 percent of face value at that 
price the bonds would yield more than 27 percent to maturity in 
1998 assuming the taj can generate the income to make its payments 
the low price reflects investor worries that trumps casinos 
could turn out to be another resorts international inc 
that gaming company which trump sold to merv griffin in exchange 
for the taj defaulted on its bonds last year resorts is seeking 
court approval of a plan it hopes will take it out of chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection 
given the experiences of trump and resorts investors may think 
twice about buying bonds usually considered among the safest of 
investments if they are issued by a company dependent on gambling 
some analysts and fund managers see nothing wrong with gaming per 
se but they offer plenty of caveats 
the casino industry as a whole is a relatively stable 
industry says robert nelson vice president at the rating agency 
standard amp poors corp 
the key to judging investments in the field nelson says is to 
find casino operators whose properties are wellbuilt wellmanaged 
and located in prime areas it also helps to be diversified 
geographically so a slowdown in one market such as atlantic city 
doesnt threaten the business he adds 
sampp has looked at the field and it gives only one casino company 
an investmentgrade rating circus circus enterprises inc that 
company has casinos in the major nevada markets and later this month 
plans to open the worlds largest hotel the 4000room 
castleshaped excalibur in las vegas 
b daniel evans president of fitch investors services inc says 
casinos can be real cash cows if operators attract a steady stream 
of high rollers 
its run like an insurance business except its on a cash 
basis like a mcdonalds he says 
the house odds for a casino are like an insurers actuarial 
tables evans says a lucky gambler or cardcounter may make a 
killing but over time the odds are in the houses favor and the 
take can be predicted with some precision 
trumps problem evans says is volume the taj mahal represented 
a big increase in capacity for an atlantic city market that has 
shown little growth in recent years 
if the taj goes well it has to go at the expense of other 
entities including the trump plaza and trump castle casinos 
evans says indeed holders of the plaza and castle bonds last week 
sued trump claiming he shortchanged the casinos by steering high 
rollers to the taj mahal 
ralph stellmacher manager of oppenheimers high yield fund says 
he is not too concerned about the funds holdings of trump plaza and 
castle bonds because they are secured by mortgages on the properties 
unless the bottom falls out from underneath mr trump they 
represent good value here he said 
the fund also has bought some of resorts bonds recently 
expecting to profit from the companys reorganization he said the 
plan calls for investors to exchange 927 million in resorts bonds 
for a 78 percent stake in the company and 430 million in new bonds 
it would leave resorts wellcapitalized stellmacher said 
evans said the decline of trumps bonds show the markets 
skittishness the risky economics behind the taj have been known for 
months he said only the publicity about trumps reported problems 
and supposed fall from the ranks of billionaires has changed he 
says 
to own these bonds youve got to be patient and be able to 
take a longterm view evans says certainly at these prices it 
increases your gamblers odds

the government unveiled plans friday to 
slash the countrys deficit and lower inflation in an effort to 
prevent portugal from falling behind as europe approaches economic 
and monetary union in 1992 
finance minister miguel beleza said in a statement that an 
economic adjustment plan would cut current public sector spending 
and possibly raise some tax rates on purchases 
economists have warned the large public sector deficit has 
overheated the economy boosting inflation and damaging portugals 
chances of meeting ec deadlines for monetary integration 
according to government forecasts the 1990 deficit will total 
about 41 billion inflation registered 129 percent on an 
annualized basis in april about double the ec average 
beleza said the program aims to halve the public sector deficit 
in five years to 35 percent of the gross domestic product and 
trim inflation to below 5 percent 
beleza said portugal must fully participate in the ecs plans for 
economic and monetary union in order to influence the future shape 
of the 12nation trade block 
he restated portugals commitment to place the escudo in the 
exchange rate mechanism of the ecs european monetary system but 
insisted it wold have to be handled cautiously 
the exchange rate mechanism fixes nine ec currencies at a set 
rate against the european currency unit and permits them to 
fluctuate within fixed limits on either side of that rate 
a statement wednesday by prime minister anibal cavaco silvas 
that portugal would join the exchange rate mechanism soon prompted a 
burst of speculative buying of escudos on world markets 
portugal greece and britain are the only ec nations outside the 
mechanism 
the remaining ec countries are belgium denmark west germany 
france ireland italy luxembourg spain and the netherlands

the government has chosen voicecoder technology 
manufactured by motorola inc as japans national standard for 
newgeneration digital cellular phones officials said friday 
motorola which has long fought to increase its foothold in the 
japanese market was selected from among eight japanese and foreign 
companies 
the decision the first to allow motorola technology to be used 
nationwide could pave the way for other foreign electronics 
companies in the japanese market said an official at the mobile 
phone division of the post and telecommunications ministry 
the ministry official said the action showed the japanese market 
is now open to foreign competitors the result also proved the 
excellence of the us technology he said speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
anybody regardless of whether japanese or foreign can sell 
their products here only if the quality is high its up to how much 
effort each company will make he said 
the decision follows an unprecedented agreement in april to 
attack the underlying economic reasons for the persistent us trade 
deficit with japan under a trade agreement called the structural 
impediments initiative japan promised to reform the closeddoor 
policies long employed to bar foreign competition 
the cellular phone issue had been a major dispute between japan 
and the united states although it was excluded from the list of 
highpriority trade issues under the 1988 trade act 
motorolas codec speech coder system the technology to 
digitalize voice sounds and send them to a receiving unit proved 
best among those offered said kiyohiro omatsuzawa a spokesman for 
a governmentbacked research and development center for radios 
system 
most existing cellular phone systems are based on analog 
technology but digital systems which allow vastly more callers to 
use the service at once are believed to be the wave of the future 
omatsuzawa said major manufacturers will produce trial equipment 
based on motorolas design before starting mass production such 
digital cellular phones will be marketed by the end of 1991 
replacing the current telephone with analog system he said 
he said other competitors were swedens ericsson and japans 
toshiba corp ntt nec corp matsushita communication industrial 
co mitsubishi electric co and fujitsu 
ministry commissions are studying details of the standards for 
the new transmission system 
last month japan mobile communications also known as ido 
signed a contract with motorola to supply cellular equipment but 
only for the corridor between tokyo and japans central city of 
nagoya 
for the last two years motorola has also supplied cellular phone 
system equipment to ddi a japanese company while selling cellular 
phones to both ddi and nippon telegraph and telephone corp 
in june a bilateral agreement opened the way for the 
introduction of motorolas cellular phone technology in the greater 
tokyo area which had been limited to ntt technology

the more customers know about mcdonalds food the easier 
it will be for them to see how mcdonalds fits into their balanced

form since 1986 
what were trying to do now is make it as easy as possible for

include nutrient values as well as complete ingredient listings she

texas instruments inc blamed defense department 
cuts today when announcing a plan to reduce its workforce by about 
1000 employees over the next year 
the cuts will come at the companys defense systems amp electronics 
group which employs about 22000 people primarily in the united 
states texas instruments said 
as we told stockholders at out annual meeting in april we 
expect defense markets to decline for at least the first half of the 
1990s as the us department of defense adjusts to the changing 
world political environment said william b mitchell ti 
executive vice president and dseg president 
the employees affected may be able to bid for other jobs in the 
company the company said all will be given job placement 
assistance 
texas instruments develops manufactures and markets 
semiconductors defense electronics systems software computer 
systems and consumer electronics products 
the company said it did not expect the workforce reduction to 
have much effect on its secondquarter financial results 
our strategy is to size our defense business to the declining 
market and then as the market stabilizes drive for increased 
market share mitchell said ti has a strong technology base and 
a good mix of programs which will help the company remain a strong 
competitor in the defense market of the 1990s 
the company reported 1989 earnings of 65 billion up from 64 
billion in the previous year first quarter revenues were 15 
billion down about 4 percent from the same quarter the previous 
year

prime minister toshiki kaifu said friday he would 
not give in to a key us trade demand that japan specify targets 
for boosting its public works spending a hopedfor wedge in opening 
the market here to more foreign business 
kaifus tough stand coming a day after a stunning trade 
breakthrough in which japan accepted us technology as a 
cellularphone standard suggests the government intends to assert 
itself despite heavy pressure for economic reform 
japan agreed in april to increase public spending as part of an 
unprecedented pact to reduce its 49 billion trade surplus with the 
united states by attacking trade barriers but the prime minister 
has come under harsh criticism in parliament for bowing to us 
demands 
kaifu said friday that japan would refuse to specify the ratio of 
public works spending to its gross national product in a final 
report on the april agreement called the structural impediments 
initiative 
it was settled in the interim report in april kaifu told 
reporters i dont quite understand why they are raising the issue 
again 
japan did agree then to boost public spending which would expand 
the number of projects that us firms could bid on 
but the united states had sought a definite annual spending 
target japan rejecting what it called interference in internal 
affairs said it would specify a total figure for the next 10 years 
and decide yearly spending flexibly to avoid overheating the economy 
kaifus firm stand was a striking contrast to thursdays 
announcement the government in what may be the most potent symbol 
of japans recent willingness to open its markets said it was 
adopting digital cellularphone technology made by motorola inc 
as a national standard 
that has been unthinkable during the past 40 years but it 
happened said richard c koo senior economist with the nomura 
research institute a think tank connected with nomura securities 
i was stunned 
motorolas codec speech coder system the technology to 
digitalize voice sounds and send them to a receiving unit 
outperformed six japanese and one swedish company to be chosen as 
the national standard japanese officials said 
koo said the significance of the decision is that it came without 
the overt pressure and acrimonious debate that marked previous trade 
talks 
the japanese side moved before it became an issue he said 
it really is a first for japan and it couldnt have been made 
without decisions at the highest level 
the ministry of posts and telecommunications chose motorola over 
japanese giants toshiba corp nippon telephone and telegraph nec 
corp matsushita communication industrial co mitsubishi electric 
co and fujitsu as well as swedens ericsson 
a ministry official said the action showed the japanese market 
now is open to foreign competitors the result also proved the 
excellence of the us technology he said speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
anybody regardless of whether japanese or foreign can sell 
their products here only if the quality is high its up to how much 
effort each company will make he said 
motorola which lost its oncesignature television business to 
japanese competitors and eventually sold its tv division to 
matsushita in 1974 long has fought to increase its foothold in the 
japanese market with other technologies 
the schaumburg illbased company first tried to enter japans 
cellular phone market in the mid1980s and met stiff resistance in 
1987 the united states and japan agreed that japan would operate 
under two cellular standards ntts in the busy tokyonagoya strip 
and motorolas in the rest of the country phones using one standard 
did not operate in the others territory 
last year under the threat of us trade sanctions on 50 
japanese products japan agreed to open its cellular phone market 
and allow motorola to compete in the tokyo area 
japans cellular phone market is estimated to be worth about 2 
billion over the next five years

japans desire to avoid us trade retaliation and 
its growing realization that many japanese consumers want the 
benefits of an open market have already forced some restructuring of 
business practices economists say 
while us and japanese negotiators meet in tokyo on june 2526 
to hammer out the final report on the groundbreaking structural 
impediments initiative the government even now is implementing some 
of pacts reforms 
last month the ministry of international trade and industry 
told local governments it has shortened the application period for 
opening large retail stores to 18 months under previous law the 
application could take up to 10 years effectively shutting most 
us retailers out of the market 
on june 6 japans fair trade commission issued new 
antimonopoly enforcement guidelines that would prohibit 
manufacturers from pressuring discount shops that sell goods below 
manufacturerrecommended prices 
as part of the sii agreements in april japan agreed to 
deregulate its complex distribution system including a relaxation 
on the establishment of large retail stores to increase enforcement 
of antitrust laws with tougher penalties for bidrigging and to 
work to lower land prices 
the agreements came during a flurry of japanese concessions aimed 
at keeping the united states from putting japan on a retaliatory 
hit list of countries with the most offensive trade barriers 
there is a sea change going on slowly but surely said 
richard c koo senior economist with the nomura research institute 
its in the interest of the united states not to press too hard to 
the point that it invites negative reaction

grain and soybean futures prices fell in heavy 
trading friday on the chicago board of trade 
weather remains the key force driving the market as forecasts 
call for dry conditions for the corn and soybean crop producing 
areas into next week with a return of wet conditions late in the 
week said steve freed an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in 
chicago 
corn prices were pushed lower by profittaking with the market 
ignoring planting delays and the possibility of yield losses from 
late planting of fields 
soybean futures were pushed lower by preweekend liquidation and 
professional selling 
soybeans also came under pressure from a concern that additional 
acres will be planted in areas of the midwest where corn planting 
has been delayed 
soybeans can be planted in the southern midwest into the first 
week of july because they mature faster than corn 
wheat fell as traders shrugged off reports of disease ravaging 
soft red winter wheat crops in the lower midwest 
at the close wheat was 4 cents lower to 1 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 330 a bushel corn was 3 cents 
lower to a cent higher with july at 284 a bushel oats were a 
cent lower to 1 cents higher with july at 148 a bushel soybeans 
were 2 cents to 4 cents lower with july at 6 a bushel

a national task force on the wine industry 
says it is time the 50 states stopped treating each other like 
foreign countries and buried the restless corpse of prohibition 
the 33state task force is asking the national conference on 
state legislatures to standardize licensing unify statefederal and 
interstate regulations and consider reciprocal shipping agreements 
between states 
complying with the staggering array of state and federal 
regulation tests the stamina of every american wine producer task 
force chairman dominic l cortese said friday 
the task forces recommendations released this week after a year 
of hearings attempt to deal with barriers created with prohibition 
repeal in 1933 when the states were permitted to retain elements of 
that 14year experiment as they saw fit 
the task force noting that 43 states make wine from the grapes 
produced by 8000 grape growers said the wine industry is one of 
the most heavily regulated industries in the united states 
as a grower of grapes the wine producer is subject to all 
agricultural regulation as a producer of wine he or she is subject 
to alcohol regulation at both the federal and state level the 
task force report said 
each state has its own comprehensive set of regulations each 
state has its own bewildering laws regarding wine and no two states 
have the same laws the federal government has its own comprehensive 
set of regulations as a result wine is one of the few products 
where interstate sales are spoken of in terms of import and 
export 
the trade barriers between the states said the task force are 
bad for business and employment they steal the competitive edge and 
ultimately are bad for the state and national economies 
above all said the lawmakers a joint committee should be formed 
with the liquor administrators to review the uniformity of laws 
among the states and make recommendations regarding policies that 
could be adopted by all the states 
since the 21st amendment told the states they could make their 
own licensed beverage laws the federal government would not be 
involved in much of what the wine task force hopes to accomplish 
said cortese who also chairman of the state assembly select 
committee on california wine production and economy 
the recommendations are the product of four hearings in tulsa 
okla santa fe new mex sacramento calif and boise idaho the 
general membership of the ncsl made up of state lawmakers will 
vote on them in august in nashville tenn 
the us wine industry accounts for 250000 jobs and 12 billion 
in retail sales annually according to the california wine institute

president bush told pork producers friday 
that his administration continues to push for including all 
agricultural products in a new international trade accord despite 
stiff resistance from europe 
leaders of the swine industry meantime announced an alliance 
with colleagues in canada and mexico to attack barriers to sales of 
their products overseas and provide ammunition to us 
negotiators at the uruguay round of talks under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade 
farm trade already is big business the us department of 
agriculture estimates total us agricultural exports will reach 
approximately 40 billion in the fiscal year that ends in september 
expanding export markets for pork particularly in japan has 
helped fuel a surge in hog prices which reached record heights last 
week in the united states 
pork products accounted for a record 325 million in us farm 
exports in 1989 but mike wehler of plain wis president of the 
national pork producers council said he told bush that despite a 
growing export market we are a 6 percent to 7 percent net 
importer of pork 
european markets have been tough to crack because of restrictive 
standards and subsidized competition pork producers complain 
bush said his administration is working to remove those barriers 
were determined to press in the uruguay round for all 
agriculture products to be included bush told pork producers as a 
pool of reporters was ushered out of the room at the start of the 
meeting 
its hard to get this and particularly to get the europeans to 
do what they should be doing in giving up markets bush said 
according to the pool report i want you to know at the outset 
were not backing off 
after the meeting john hardin of danville ind presidentelect 
of the pork council praised what he said was the presidents firm 
commitment to protect agricultural interests in the uruguay round of 
gatt 
bush met for just under a half hour with 14 representatives of 
the pork group following an appearance at a fundraising breakfast 
for gov terry branstad 
wehler said the council which represents 300000 pork producers 
believes its members are the most efficient producers in the world 
but he said us pork is locked out of many markets by unfair 
competition 
we seek a level playing field he told reporters at a 
postmeeting briefing we were pleased that he bush was 
supportive of those types of comments 
wehler said the participation in a north american alliance for 
pork with canada and mexico would help secretary of agriculture 
clayton yeutter and trade representative carla hills in their talks 
aimed at countering subsidies of competing foreign farm products 
and even though us and canadian hog producers have battled in 
the past on subsidies on canadian pork products shipped to the 
united states wehler told reporters some things we can agree 
upon 
he said bush encouraged us to keep the pressure on in the 
export arena so that the producers of this country have the 
opportunity to expand their market

wholesale gasoline prices tumbled friday while 
home heating oil and crude finished moderately higher trading 
volume was light to moderate 
energy analysts said futures on the new york mercantile exchange 
bobbed up early in the session on rumors of a possible opec meeting 
to address the recent slump in oil prices but the buying subsided 
when there was no confirmation that the oil cartel would meet 
crude and heating oil managed to end the day with minor gains due 
to short covering which is buying to compensate for previous sales 
the contract for july delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude oil closed at 1678 a 42gallon 
barrel adding 11 cents the contract lost 25 cents thursday later 
months also gains 
the july contract for home heating oil rose 031 cent to 4721 
cents a gallon after losing 041 cent on thursday subsequent months 
settled unchanged to moderately higher 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for july delivery dropped 102 cents 
to 5659 cents a gallon expanding thursdays loss of 075 cent 
most of the selling was confined to the july and august contracts 
later months ended modestly higher 
john h oconnell senior energy analyst at refco inc said the 
decline in gasoline came in reaction to bearish industry statistics 
released earlier this week showing a buildup in oil stocks 
he said gasoline prices had not responded to the earlier news as 
fully as other energy futures so fridays selling represented a 
correction to previous market activity 
a news report that the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries might convene a special session initially encouraged 
buying but the report which oconnell said was based on comments 
by a south american opec official came to be viewed with skepticism 
by energy traders 
in natural gas trading prices ended mixed the july contract 
closed marginally higher at 1575 per 1000 cubic feet compared to 
1573 on thursday later contracts settled slightly lower to

texas instruments inc and general dynamics corp 
a pair of major defense contractors plan to lay off almost 2000 
people in texas because of anticipated military budget cutbacks 
texas instruments said friday it will trim its defense systems amp 
electronics group by about 1000 employees in the next year 
the announcement came one day after general dynamics announced 
planned cuts of 500 to 800 people over the next few months at its 
fort worth division 
both companies said their decisions were influenced by the 
shrinking us defense dollar 
improved relations between the united states and the soviet union 
have resulted in a series of arms reductions and lawmakers are 
showing an increasing reluctance to keep purchasing new military 
hardware 
its unfortunate that our industry and employees must bear the 
brunt of these changes it is the price we in this industry will pay 
for enhanced world peace and stability said charles a anderson 
a division vice president and general manager for general dynamics 
william b mitchell dseg president for texas instruments said 
his company doesnt expect things to get better soon 
as we told stockholders at our annual meeting in april we 
expect defense markets to decline for at least the first half of the 
1990s as the us department of defense adjusts to the changing 
world political environment mitchell said 
ti employs about 22000 people at its dseg texas plants in 
abilene austin lewisville mckinney and sherman and at facilities

mcdonalds corp said friday it would post 
complete nutritional information including fat and sodium levels 
on all of its products at its restaurants this summer 
terri capatosto a spokeswoman for the nations biggest fastfood 
restaurant chain said the move was intended as a convenience for 
mcdonalds customers not as a response to a recent ad campaign 
attacking the nutritional value of the companys food 
weve been providing complete nutrition information since 
1973 she said weve provided nutrition information in booklet 
form since 1986 
what were trying to do now is make it as easy as possible for 
customers to get information before they make a purchase at 
mcdonalds 
but omaha industrialist phil sokolof who has used advertising 
and the news media to pressure a number of food companies to reduce 
or remove saturated fats from their products criticized the move 
was window dressing 
sokolof who blames a bad diet for a heart attack he suffered 
years ago took out fullpage ads in newspapers across the country 
on april 4 calling on mcdonalds to cut the amount of saturated fat 
on its menu 
mcdonalds said sokolofs ad which was headlined the 
poisoning of america was malicious and contained inaccurate and 
misleading information 
the company will post nutritional information posters on the 
customer side of its more than 8200 restaurants capatosto 
said the posters will include nutrient values and complete 
ingredient listings she said 
she said mcdonalds wants to ensure that its customers receive 
the information ahead of time so that they can make more informed 
choices 
but sokolof complained that what needed to be done was reduce the 
saturated fat content of mcdonalds food 
mcdonalds affects the lives of millions of people a day he 
said one simple step eliminating beef tallow from their french 
fries could reduce the incidence of heart attacks in our country 
in recent years mcdonalds has developed a menu that includes 
salads 2 percent milk and bran muffins it has said it is 
experimenting with using pure vegetable oil rather than the 
current beef shorteningvegetable oil mixture for frying its 
french fries and hash browns

cocoa futures prices were sharply lower friday on new yorks 
coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange amid widespread stoploss selling 
on other markets grain and soybeans were lower livestock and 
pork futures mixed precious metals were mixed and energy futures 
were higher 
the cocoa futures market opened moderately lower following the 
london markets lead but regained some ground before plunging due 
to commission house selling 
judith ganes an analyst for merrill lynch in new york said a 
number of factors contributed to the markets selloff 
she said the market rose recently because of concerns about the 
political climate in the ivory coast a major producer of cocoa she 
said the unstable conditions in that country have eased largely 
removing market concerns 
also weighing on cocoa futures was the settlement of the 
brazilian dock workers strike ms ganes noted that although the 
strike had not prompted a rally in the market the settlement 
allowed the shipment of cocoa and gave those wanting to sell a 
reason to do so 
cocoa settled 65 to 76 lower with the contract for delivery in 
july at 1235 a ton 
grain and soybean futures were lower in heavy trading the chicago 
board of trade 
weather remains the key force driving the market as forecasts 
call for dry conditions for the corn and soybean crop producing 
areas into next week with a return of wet conditions late in the 
week said steve freed an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in 
chicago 
corn prices were pushed lower by profittaking with the market 
ignoring planting delays and the possibility of yield losses from 
late planting of fields 
soybean futures were pushed lower by preweekend liquidation and 
professional selling 
soybeans also came under pressure from a concern that additional 
acres will be planted in areas of the midwest where corn planting 
has been delayed 
soybeans can be planted in the southern midwest into the first 
week of july because they mature faster than corn 
wheat fell as traders shrugged off reports of disease ravaging 
soft red winter wheat crops in the lower midwest 
wheat was 4 cents lower to cent higher july at 330 a bushel 
corn was 3 cents lower to a cent higher with july at 284 a 
bushel oats were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with july at 148 
a bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 5 cents lower with july at 6 a 
bushel 
energy futures were mostly higher in trading on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
crude oil prices climbed on rumors that opec ministers will hold 
an emergency meeting to discuss violations of production quotas 
said jerry samuels an analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in 
new york 
short covering in advance of the weekend also contributed to the 
modest gains in crude oil short covering occurs when traders buy 
contracts so that they can fulfill earlier promises to sell 
gasoline futures were also higher with trading shrugging off 
concerns over the huge stocks of gasoline reported earlier in the 
week analysts said 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 11 cents to 18 cents higher 
with july at 1678 a barrel heating oil was 10 cent to 31 cent 
higher with july at 4721 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 102

cypress semiconductor corp said friday 
it plans to make computer chips and other electronic devices for the 
soviet union in a unique licensing agreement that will give the 
company soviet chipmaking technologies 
cypress signed a letter of intent with the international center 
for informatics and electronics of moscow which has officials 
touring the silicon valley as part of a 10day silicon summit 
tj rodgers president and chief executive officer of cypress 
said the deal which is still being developed will be a good 
technological marriage 
the soviets will provide semiconductor designs that cypress would 
modify for production in its manufacturing plants for sale to us 
customers the soviet chips involved are used for highdefinition 
television and sound and audio processing 
cypress does not currently make any products covered under the 
agreement and views this as an opportunity to expand 
rodgers estimated it would be at least a year before cypress 
produces a sample chip from a soviet design but that 
sovietdesigned chips could generate as much as 60 million per year 
in sales for cypress two or three years from now cypress revenues 
from all sources were 1993 million last year 
the soviets main interest in the deal is not to gain access to 
us products but to work with american companies to commercialize 
and manufacture technology products that the soviets are designing 
the chips in the proposed cypress deal are being designed by the 
soviet international center for informatics and electronics a 
coalition of about 40 soviet science and engineering organizations 
set up to remove advancedtechnology development from government 
control 
the soviets have made advances in a semiconductor technology 
known as submicron lithography which can be used to produce 
extremely dense silicon chips that could handle large volumes of 
data quickly the soviets also developed advanced compounds to coat 
magnetic disks in disk drives to make them faster more reliable and 
longerlasting than usdesigned disk drives 
but while the soviets have developed these new technologies in 
the laboratories members of the delegation said they lack the 
manufacturing capability to bring them to market as commercial 
products 
our activity in research and development and microelectroncs 
have produced new technologies and new technology equipment said 
kamil valiev director of the soviet institute of physics and 
technology we have proposed to come to us companies and have 
them make commercial products from our technology and we hope this 
summit is the first step along the way 
rodgers and key cypress personnel will travel to zelenograd 
considered the silicon valley of the soviet union in july to 
discuss the specific technologies and products under consideration 
under the terms of the agreement cypress would acquire the 
advanced semiconductor fabrication technologies developed by the 
soviets and a license to manufacture some semiconductor products 
designed by the soviets 
in return cypress would pay royalties to the soviet union which 
are still being negotiated cypress plans to deposit 100000 in an 
escrow account from which the soviets can start to withdraw 
royalties rodgers said 
the soviets signed the letter of intent after touring the cypress 
plant in san jose thursday in high style the visitors arrived in 
stretch limousines and were welcomed by a brass band cheering 
employees and american and soviet flags flapping in the wind 
as soon as we stepped into the plant and put on our protective 
white suits i realized we had opened doors here and that we would 
sign an agreement today nicolai kleschev general director of the 
soviets international informatics center said through an 
interpreter 
the products that are being considered for manufacture under the 
deal include chips for high definition television digital signal 
processing telecommunications and audio and video products 
cypress a chip design development and manufacture company 
currently doesnt make any of those products 
this is a tremendous opportunity for cypress rodgers said 
our philosophy is to grow through the addition of new products and 
product lines this agreement fits our needs perfectly it also 
meets the soviets needs they require high quality process 
technology international marketing capabilities and support as 
well as negotiable currency all things we can provide 
cypress makes programmable logic devices memory programs and 
other computer products

insurance policies designed to protect malcolm 
forbes estate from the taxman may have proved to be the bon vivant 
businessmans last capitalist tool 
insurance companies that originally balked at paying millions of 
dollars in claims to the estate have paid up a forbes official said 
friday 
the late publisher of the business magazine dubbed capitalist 
tool reportedly took out millions of dollars in life insurance 
with different companies in the years preceding his death in 
february at age 70 
forbes died of an apparent heart attack at timberfield his far 
hills nj mansion but john hancock mutual insurance company last 
month withheld payment on a multimilliondollar policy pending an 
investigation into the claim 
hancock officials had said only that an investigation was being 
conducted but published reports indicated medical information 
provided by forbes was being examined 
but hancock spokesman richard bevilacqua said the company had 
completed its routine investigation and paid the claim 
forbes spokesman don garson said all pending insurance claims 
have been paid to the forbes estate 
neither spokesman would discuss the amounts of money involved 
but garson said that the previously reported figure of 46 million 
in total insurance claims was too low 
forbes is an exceptionally valuable property that 46 
million seems like a drop in the bucket he said 
garson said forbes often commented that the only way to pass on 
an estate worth any money when he died was to have large amounts of 
life insurance 
estimates of forbes estate range from 400 million to 1 
billion the estate would be taxed in the 55 percent brackets 
according to tax specialists but much of forbes estate such as 
the magazine and his art collection could not go on the auction 
block to pay the government 
forbes apparent solution was to take out insurance polices some 
within the last two years to pay the necessary cash 
garson said no discrepancies were discovered in the medical 
information forbes provided to hancock i can assure you all 
investigations have been completed there were no irregularities 
and the claims have all been paid he said 
bevilacqua would not discuss the details of the agreement between 
hancock and the forbes estate which he said was concluded tuesday

bond prices dipped in light trading friday as 
many traders stayed on the sidelines awaiting several government 
reports scheduled to be released next week 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond fell 532 point or about 
156 per 1000 face amount while its yield which rises when 
prices fall rose to 844 percent from late thursdays 842 percent 
analysts said bond traders were just marking time as they waited 
for the figures that will provide clues on the direction of the 
economy and perhaps give some insight into the federal reserves 
credit policy 
the labor department will issue wholesale and consumer price 
figures for may while the commerce department will announce retail 
sales figures for may and trade deficit reports for the first 
quarter and for april 
if the figures indicate a slowing of the economy and inflation 
bond traders will be looking for some sign from the fed that it will 
relax credit allowing interest rates to decline and bond prices to 
rise 
some analysts say favorable figures could reignite the price 
surge of june 1 when the labor department announced employment 
figures that signaled a weakening of the economy 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments were unchanged to 116 point lower intermediate 
maturities were 132 point to 116 point lower and longterm issues 
ranged from lsqb point to 532 point lower according to telerate inc 
the financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 094 to 115967 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 91 the average yield to 
maturity remained at 75 percent 
yields on threemonth treasury bills were unchanged at 795 
percent as the discount held steady at 770 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills rose to 803 percent as the discount advanced 4 
basis points to 763 percent yields on oneyear bills rose to 806 
percent as the discount picked up 1 basis point to reach 751 
percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each other 
on overnight loans was quoted at 8 316 percent down from 8 
percent late thursday

eastern airlines has for the first time recalled 
pilots who stayed off the job until the end of the air line pilots 
assocation strike the company said friday 
they will be among 90 pilots called back to handle increased 
summer schedules and a planned expansion of atlanta routes said 
airline spokeswoman karen ceremsak 
most of the 90 had volunteered to work before the end of the alpa 
strike in november but the group also included some pilots who 
refused to sign up until the eightmonth job action officially ended 
ms ceremsak said the recalls were unrelated to ongoing 
negotiations with alpa in washington and were instead based on the 
airlines needs 
eastern alpa spokesman ej breen said the union had mixed 
emotions about the action 
its terrific but were disappointed that in seeking labor 
peace the management has screwed it up breen said 
the union thought it had an agreement that pilots would be called 
back by seniority but instead eastern went outside the seniority 
lists he said 
they have only done it because they need us and theyve done 
it in a confrontational way breen said 
but he acknowledged there have been other positive signs on 
friday eastern withdrew several new york court suits challenging 
alpas right to represent the pilots 
ms ceremsak said another reason eastern needs pilots is that 
many currently flying to south america will need to be retrained 
when those routes are turned over to american airlines this summer 
no pilots will be laid off due to that change she said 
the returning pilots will not begin flying immediately they must 
be retrained under both airline and federal aviation administration 
rules and will have to pass physical exams 
before the recall eastern had 1775 pilots flying about 800 
flights a day she said 
the pilots arent the first hardcore strikers to return ms 
ceremsak said that among 440 flight attendants recalled since 
thanksgiving are employees who remained on strike until their union 
agreed to return to work 
the recalls do not affect the machinists union whose members 
struck march 4 1989 amid a contract impasse and rising hostilities 
with frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp the 
other two unions walked out in sympathy 
control of the airline was taken away from lorenzo in april when 
a bankruptcy court judge appointed current trustee martin shugrue 
because creditors had lost confidence in the old management 
shugrue and the machinists union have established a dialogue but 
there have been no details on their talks

knoxvilles morning and afternoon 
newspapers locked in a legal battle since january agreed friday to 
dissolve their joint operating agreement by the end of december 1991 
owners of the knoxville newssentinel and the knoxville journal 
announced they had reached an agreement in principle to end their 
4yearold joa 
the parties expect to sign a definitive agreement by june 21 
1990 following notice to the department of justice their 
statement said 
after the joa ends the journal intends to publish separately 
and in competition with the newssentinel the statement said 
the newssentinel is owned by the ew scripps co of cincinnati 
the morning paper has a daily circulation of 101000 and a sunday 
circulation of 169000 
the journal is owned by persis corp of honolulu hawaii the 
afternoon paper publishes monday through saturday with a circulation 
of 40000 
under the joa the newssentinel provides sales production and 
distribution for the journal editorial departments of the two 
newspapers are separate 
the statement did not say where the journal will publish after 
1991 
as part of the termination arrangement the newssentinel will 
pay persis 40 million in two 20 million installments the money 
will be in lieu of payments the journal would have received from 
dec 31 1991 through the scheduled end of the joa on dec 31 2005 
the termination arrangement also will end litigation brought by 
the newssentinel in knox county chancery court against persis in 
january 
the lawsuit alleged persis violated the joa terms when the hawaii 
company purchased the maryville daily times in neighboring blount 
county in december journal editor and publisher gerald garcia also 
was made the president and publisher of the daily times 
the daily times publishes in the afternoon with a circulation of 
21000 
however the newssentinel which recently began a zoned edition 
in maryville considered the daily times a direct competitor 
the lawsuit contended that with garcia in the dual roles the 
daily times would have access to the newssentinels confidential 
business information and trade secrets 
we are pleased with the agreement said thurston twiggsmith 
president and chief executive of persis 
once we concluded that it was unlikely that the joa would be 
extended beyond 2005 we wanted to begin separate publication at a 
time when the journal was a strong and vital part of the knoxville 
community he said 
the newssentinels agreement to pay persis 40 million will 
result in a charge to ew scripps secondquarter 1990 net income 
of about 23 million or 30 cents a share 
this onetime payment is less than the expected amount the 
newssentinel would have paid in distributions to the journal had
