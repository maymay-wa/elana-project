france has lifted its 15month embargo on imports of 
crude oil from iran once its largest oil supplier 
the industry ministry informed oil companies operating in france 
on friday that imports of iranian crude are henceforth subject to 
the usual french regulations governing oil imports 
france severed its diplomatic relations with iran following the 
embassy war in the summer of 1987 when the iranian embassy in 
paris refused to allow wahid gordji an interpreter without 
diplomatic status to be interrogated by a french judge in 
connection with terrorist attacks in paris in september 1986 
the french police blocked off the embassy and the iranians 
retaliated by preventing french diplomats in tehran from leaving 
their embassy gordji and the french consul in tehran were 
eventually exchanged in november 1987 
the embargo was partially lifted sept 9 when france resumed 
normal diplomatic relations with iran 
oil industry officials said the partial lifting of the embargo 
did not have any practical effect because it simply involved giving 
authorization to french oil companies on a casebycase basis to do 
barter deals involving iranian crude 
the barter deals were negotiated by french trading houses and 
involved exchanges of french food and farm products notably sugar 
and meat for iranian crude 
industry sources said none of the barter deals was ever 
concluded however because the iranian asking price was felt to be 
too high in view of the bearishness of the oil market at the time 
latest oil industry statistics show no imports of iranian crude 
by france in the first nine months of this year 
france imported 44 million tons of iranian crude during the 
first eight months of 1987 imports totalled 29 million tons in 
1986 
jeanlouis breuiljarrige president of the french oil industry 
association wrote to industry minister roger fauroux in june after 
diplomatic relations were restored to point out that the embargo was 
having no real effect 
he argued that french refiners were importing petroleum products 
made from iranian crude imported by other european refiners french 
oil companies also pointed out at the time that they had a 
competitive disadvantage compared with european counterparts because 
iran was selling its crude relatively cheaply

the general assembly slapped its host 
country with an unprecedented rebuke by voting 1542 to reconvene in 
geneva so plo chairman yasser arafat barred from the united states 
can address the delegates 
the resolution adopted friday deplores the united states 
refusal to grant arafat a visa 
once again within hours the international body in this 
community has stood together for what is right against what is 
wrong said plo envoy zuhdi labib terzi 
only the united states and israel voted against the 
arabsponsored resolution britain abstained having previously said 
the criticism in the resolution was too harsh 
members of palestine liberation organization who specialized 
in hijacking of airplanes and cruise ships are expanding their 
efforts and hijacking the general assembly said israels acting 
ambassador johanan bein 
us ambassador herbert s okun the acting us representative 
said the move was unnecessary the united states contended that 
another plo delegate could present arafats viewpoints 
but the highest ranking us official at the united nations sided 
with critics saying washingtons action had done incalculable 
damage to the united states credibility in the world arena 
the comments were written by joseph v reed 
undersecretarygeneral for general assembly affairs in a letter to 
president reagan 
the assembly took the historic step of moving to the uns 
european headquarters because the united states rejected un 
appeals to admit arafat who last visited new york in 1974 
okun said the united states didnt object to the move and would 
participate in debate there 
arafat wants to address the 159nation assembly to explain the 
plos declaration of an independent state and its implicit 
recognition of israel the palestinian issue will be discussed dec 
1315 in geneva 
it will be the first session the united nations has convened 
outside new york since moving into its building in manhattan in 1952 
okun said the united states was justified in denying a visa to 
arafat whom the reagan administration called an accessory to 
terrorism 
critics said the us action violated the 1947 un headquarters 
agreement under which the united states is obligated to grant visas 
to un diplomats and guests 
the united nations has estimated the cost of the geneva session 
at 645500 including 159000 for firstclass roundtrip tickets 
to geneva for delegates of the worlds 40 poorest countries 
since 1946 the united nations has paid travel expenses of the 
least developed nations so they can be represented in deliberations 
the cost also includes travel for at least 30 un officials and 
staff translation and documentation in six official languages and 
other expenses 
on wednesday the assembly overwhelmingly denounced the us 
denial of a visa to arafat and gave the united states 24 hours to 
reconsider 
again only the united states and israel voted against the 
resolution britain abstained 
on thursday night the us government said it would not change 
its position the resolution to move to geneva was introduced early 
friday 
in his letter to reagan written after the wednesday vote reed 
said the state department position is baffling and contradictory 
because chairman arafat has already addressed the general assembly 
in 1974 and thus set a precedent for being granted an entry visa 
dominica was not present for fridays vote and south africa has 
not had voting rights since 1974 because of its policy of apartheid

a retired general services administration 
official faces a maximum 36year prison term when hes sentenced 
feb 3 for receiving 24185 in bribes to provide inside information 
to two businessmen who were found guilty of conspiracy 
lester h finotti jr 56 a former manager in gsas 
transportation audit branch was convicted by a us district court 
jury of receiving the money and the use of a luxury automobile 
during an 18month period ending in september 1986 
william h white sr 59 and carmine w depietro 53 the former 
president and former executive vice president respectively of 
southern investment co were convicted of conspiracy to defraud the 
government 
the charge carries a fiveyear term 
the three defendants were allowed to remain free on bond until 
their sentencing feb 3 by us district judge harold greene 
the scheme involved an effort to obtain inside information from 
gsa to help the fayetteville nc company which purchased 
billsoflading at a discount from moving companies that hauled 
furniture of government employees 
under the arrangement known as factoring the moving companies in 
effect paid southern investment a premium to receive their money 
faster than if they waited for the government to pay them directly 
southern investment in turn assumed total liability for any 
claims for damaged freight that the government filed against the 
trucking companies 
the prosecution presented evidence that finotti provided 
information about the reliability of freight haulers that enabled 
white and depietro to decide whether to factor a companys 
billsoflading 
such information would enable southern investment to avoid 
purchasing moving bills from companies that would likely incur large 
damage claims the prosecution contended 
the indictment charged that finotti manipulated the payment of 
billsoflading to benefit southern investment 
finotti of waldorf md was convicted of conspiracy bribery 
conflictofinterest and filing a false government financial 
disclosure statement that did not report his financial arrangement 
with southern investment co

us authorities have refused to grant refugee 
status to more than 200 soviet jews and armenians but a state 
department official says they could be eligible to enter this 
country through a system known as parole 
state department spokesman charles e redman said friday that the 
wouldbe refugees were unable to demonstrate a wellfounded fear 
of persecution but one way or another he said we continue to 
admit all soviet jewish applicants who choose to come to the united 
states 
the issue was raised by the union of councils for soviet jews 
the private group released two petitions from soviet jews in italy 
awaiting entrance visas to the united states 
most jews who are permitted to leave the soviet union have exit 
permits to emigrate to israel but an overwhelming majority choose 
to go to the united states after they reach rome or vienna 
redman said of more than 4000 applications in rome in october 
and november less than 200 were found not to qualify for refugees 
status but he said if this occurs the applicants are without 
exception given the opportunity to apply for parole 
to be granted parole the us official said applicants must 
show they would be supported by a relative or a sponsor in the event 
jobs were not found the idea is to avoid additional us welfare 
costs 
entering as a refugee provides certain benefits that are not 
available under parole these include transportation expenses some 
support for resettlement and access to medicaid 
in moscow he said 99 applicants most of whom were armenians 
did not qualify for refugee status during the two months but 
redman said they also may seek admission under the parole system 
redman said there was no change in us policy 
the united states continues to call for freedom of emigration 
for all and continues to admit all soviet jewish applicants who 
choose to come to the united states he said most qualify as 
refugees and in addition some enter as parolees

days in a variety of elite east coast private schools showed him the

distressed about the content of some television talk shows saying 
they come close to inciting the public 
it is getting close to crying fire in a crowded elevator 
utley said in a speech to the radiotelevision news directors 
association on thursday 
utley lambasted shows hosted by morton downey jr and geraldo 
rivera rivera recently had his nose broken when a fight broke out 
during filming of a show on white supremacists 
the very presence of these shows on our tv screen gives the

the new military spy satellite carried into 
space is viewed by some experts as capable of gathering such 
important information that it is only a matter of time before the 
soviets begin to think of ways of destroying it in the event of war 
like the roughly 200 military satellites already deployed in 
space by the united states and soviet union the 500 million 
lacrosse satellite reportedly aboard the space shuttle atlantis is 
not armed it is a surveillance satellite carrying a sophisticated 
radar that can look down from space piercing even cloud cover to 
reveal whats happening on the ground 
as military satellites become more directly applicable to 
actual combat they become much more attractive targets for 
destruction said john pike an expert on space systems with the 
federation of american scientists here 
lacrosse provides a good example of that he said its 
going up there to find targets for the new stealth bomber and to 
look for longrange targets deep behind the lines in the warsaw 
pact now if ive got all that riding on my satellites the soviets 
would be crazy not to try to shoot them down 
space is already militarized agreed william arkin an 
authority on nuclear weaponry with the institute for policy studies 
a liberal think tank in washington the question is whether were 
going to avoid the weaponization of space 
the united states now has approximately 75 to 80 military 
satellites in space while roughly 125 of the 150plus russian 
satellites now in orbit are thought to have some military use the 
numbers are approximate because neither government talks about the 
matter 
the pentagon for example considers the atlantis launch a 
classified military mission for which no information will be 
provided it will neither confirm nor deny that the cargo is a 
radarimaging satellite 
as approximate as the tallies are they demonstrate the growing 
reliance of the two superpowers on military space systems it was 
only three decades ago in 1957 with russias sputnik that 
mankind developed the ability to put a manmade object into orbit 
now military satellites are in orbit spying on facilities and 
forces scanning the radio waves as electronic ferrets watching for 
nuclear explosions or missile launches and mapping the earths 
surface 
even the seemingly mundane tasks in space have become important 
for warfighting communications is an obvious example but there 
are others 
for example the latest generation of navigation satellites help 
provide the pinpoint accuracy now claimed for nuclear missiles like 
the giant mx among other functions these satellites allow the 
military to synchronize its watches down to billionths of a second 
and scrutinizing the weather becomes essential in the event of a 
war both the united states and soviet union are operating advanced 
meteorological satellites to aid lowlevel bombers detect solar 
flares and find holes in cloud cover for reconnaissance work 
the united states now has 20 military satellites of various types 
waiting to go into orbit victims of the launch hiatus forced by 
the challenger disaster and unrelated problems with unmanned titan 
boosters 
as that backlog is slowly erased arkin pike and others suggest 
the pentagon and perhaps the kremlin will face other problems 
with their satellite hardware besides protecting them as tempting 
targets 
the expense of these new types of satellites is not to be 
believed says arkin 
were going to have to look at a single satellite the way we 
look at an aircraft carrier these satellites alone are costing 250 
million and up 
such complaints dont bother pentagon officials because they see 
no alternative 
as outgoing air force secretary edward c pete aldridge 
observed recently we must put a large part of our investment 
into the satellites which meet mission needs today and tomorrow 
simply stated we must be able to conduct operations in space at 
all times in any environment peace or war

a soviet flight engineer who was part of 
the crew that flew five hijackers to israel said he wasnt 
threatened by the armed captors and merely gave them a lift 
yuri n yermilov appeared relaxed as he spoke from the door of 
the jet friday less than an hour after the hijackers surrendered to 
israeli police at bengurion airport 
he signed autographs for israeli reporters and agreed to be 
photographed with a hebrewlanguage magazine in his hands 
the hijackers were flown to israel after seizing a bus with 30 
children in the soviet union and trading it for a plane crew and 
33 million ransom 
they were playing cards during the flight yermilov said 
at some point some of them were in the cockpit behind us and 
they were watching us they had guns but they were not waving them 
around and threatening us 
a younger crew member who did not give his name added they 
were counting the money 
yermilov who wore a dark blue aeroflot uniform said the 
hijackers appeared to be in their 30s he said they never said why 
they chose israel as their destination 
they were people who wanted to fly out of the soviet union 
thats why they kidnapped the bus with children yermilov said 
they asked for a lift for israel and we gave them a lift he 
added jokingly 
he said the crew was appointed for the mission by soviet 
authorities 
we are international pilots we understood that we have a 
mission that has to be done yermilov said adding that the crew 
was aware of the danger 
we were told that our guarantees are zero but they the 
hijackers seemed quite goodnatured he said

a judge who suggested a child molester was driven 
to his crimes by his wifes pregnancy has resigned the lord 
chancellor said but he offered to quit before he made his 
controversial comments 
the announcement friday said that judge sir harold cassel 
submitted his resignation monday and cited health reasons on 
tuesday cassel set off a furor by giving two years probation to a 
30yearold man who admitted three indecent assaults on his 
adolescent stepdaughter 
it is regrettable that a judge should have expressed himself in 
a way that suggested that there are any circumstances that can 
excuse or condone indecent assault on children said lord mackay 
who as lord chancellor is chief of britains judicial system 
cassel 72 became a judge 12 years ago 
the defendant admitted twice molesting the girl when she was 12 
and a third time when the girl was 13 and the mother was in the last 
month of pregnancy 
the mothers condition cassel said led to a lack of sexual 
appetite in the lady and considerable problems for a healthy young 
husband 
the judge traced the abuse to the mothers efforts to overcome 
the girls resentment of the new man in the house 
the stepmother encouraged the girl to cuddle her husband and 
even got into the habit of inviting her into the marital bed the 
judge said this was not an invitation to a toddler but to a girl 
approaching puberty and the cuddles began to go too far 
the mother has filed for divorce 
more than 20 members of parliament including lawmakers from all 
major parties called for cassels resignation

presidentelect george bush and his staff are 
defending the way the transition office has handled appointments in 
a week that produced only one announcement 
all week there was speculation that bush would make 
announcements on more cabinet members particularly for the defense 
department and other national security jobs but the only statement 
was that marlin fitzwater would stay on as white house spokesman 
bush who met friday with foreign leaders and former presidential 
rivals including michael dukakis seemed to bristle when reporters 
asked him if his appointment process was stalled 
theres no holdup were way ahead of schedule he said 
complaining about early premature needless speculation 
craig fuller codirector of the bush transition office said 
bush and his aides spent part of the past week talking to experts in 
defense and national security about running the mammoth agency 
the whole point of this week has been designed to try to 
explore how best to manage the defense department what kind of 
challenges await the next secretary of defense he said 
fuller said former sen john tower of texas remains a contender 
for the job and the vice president has tremendous confidence in 
his old friend 
though fuller said nothing to dispel reports that tower is the 
leading candidate for defense secretary he added there may be 
others there may be other approaches 
fuller also said bush is taking an overview of his cabinet 
vacancies because he wants to make sure women and minorities claim 
some of the top jobs to date only white males have been named to 
the positions although lauro cavazos a hispanic has been asked to 
stay on as education secretary 
fuller said it could be a couple of weeks before the cabinet is 
in place but appointments will be made as they are decided upon 
meanwhile the washington post reported today that bush has 
decided to remove from cabinet rank the job of ambassador to the 
united nations and not to restore to cabinet level the director of 
the central intelligence agency the paper quoted transition 
officials as saying the decision reflects his belief that the two 
posts both of which he has previously held should be less 
visible in internal policymaking debates 
bush and dukakis met for 35 minutes friday and the two avoided 
the negative rhetoric that characterized the presidential campaign 
i expressed my concern obviously about the deficit dukakis 
the former democratic candidate said he also stressed issues that 
were important to democrats better health care housing education 
and the environment 
bush said afterward i want to express my appreciation to 
governor dukakis for coming our way we had good discussion of the 
issues that are facing the country in a spirit of good will 
the vice president also saw pat robertson who tried 
unsuccessfully to gain the gop presidential nomination robertson 
said he talked with bush about south africa a country the 
television evangelist recently visited 
the time has come to recognize the south african government 
needs a little encouragement said robertson an opponent of 
sanctions and disinvestment as a strategy for forcing change in the 
whiteruled country 
late in the day bush met at his residence with argentine 
president raul alfonsin who had flown in from new york for the 
getacquainted session 
neither alfonsin nor bush commented on reports from argentina 
that troops had moved into position to quell an insurrection at a 
military base outside buenos aires 
the government said later it had put down the rebellion 
vice presidentelect dan quayle secretary of state george 
shultz treasury secretary nicholas brady and assistant secretary of 
state elliott abrams attended the meeting 
bush began his day seeing bermuda premier john swan the fourth 
foreign leader he has met since he was elected alfonsin was the 
fifth and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev will be the sixth 
bush will join president reagan at a meeting with gorbachev in 
new york on dec 7 
so far bushs only scheduled event over the weekend is to attend 
a movie entitled my stepmother is an alien on saturday night 
the bushes usually attend church on sunday

the nullarbor is a huge dry plain but there is an extensive cave 
system underneath it containing subterranean water systems linking 
caves 
peter rogers who left the nullarbor group sunday said they were 
filming a documentary on the caves he said all of those trapped 
were experienced cave divers but that the cave they were in was not 
underwater 
rogers said the group radioed for help from their ground crew 
which in turn notified authorities 
it was a freak hurricane he said you dont get a lot of 
hurricanes on the nullarbor so much water washed down the entrance 
of the cave that it washed enough rubble down to cause a blockage 
about 100 feet down into the cave 
rogers said the group was safely beyond that depth in a large 
chamber about 260 feet below the surface 
no ones injured theyve got communication with the surface 
and theyve got a reasonable amount of water and food rogers said

a historic agreement giving ohio the authority 
to regulate the federal cleanup of a uranium plant was panned by 
some neighbors who plan to pursue their lawsuit against the nuclear 
weapons factory 
some fernald residents complained that the agreement between the 
us energy department and ohio approved by a federal judge friday 
fails to commit the agency to spending the 1 billion it estimates 
is needed for the cleanup 
i dont really see a commitment that cleanup will be done and i 
dont see a timetable as to when it will be done said lisa 
crawford spokeswoman for fernald residents for environmental safety 
and health 
residents also pointed out that the pact provides no money for 
victims of alleged radioactive contamination from the plant and 
that the state has agreed to give up any right to sue the energy 
department or factory contractors 
but officials said the consent decree approved here by us 
district judge s arthur spiegel is a historic document allowing 
ohio to enforce state environmental regulatory power over the 
cleanup of the plant which processes uranium for nuclear weapons 
assembled elsewhere 
the agreement also requires the department to pay the state about 
1 million in penalties and to reimburse ohio for overseeing the 
cleanup 
the energy department has admitted that the plant emitted 
radioactive uranium dust into the atmosphere over three decades the 
plant known as the feed materials production center sits on 1050 
acres 18 miles northwest of cincinnati above the great miami river 
aquifer a water source for 2 million people 
jim alexander spokesman for the energy departments oak ridge 
tenn operations which include fernald said the agreement is 
evidence of intent to clean up the plant he said it is not intended 
as an admission of wrongdoing 
sen john glenn dohio who announced the agreement with ohio 
attorney general anthony celebrezze jr said he hoped the decree 
will prompt congress to give high priority to cleanups of 17 energy 
department plants nationwide including fernald 
glenn said the energy department estimates it will cost 175 
billion to clean up the 17 sites over the next 35 years only 300 
million is budgeted for the job next year he said 
celebrezze and ohio environmental protection agency director 
richard shank said ohio will pursue two federal lawsuits against the 
energy department the agreement grew out of two years of 
negotiations in those cases 
stanley chesley a cincinnati lawyer for the plants neighbors 
said the settlement gives the state no authority over radioactive 
wastes stored at the plant 
chesley said the neighbors will proceed with their 300 million 
classaction suit at a us district court hearing dec 16 in 
cincinnati 
we have every intention of going forward he said 
plant neighbor marvin clawson whos represented in the 
classaction lawsuit said the agreement falls short of what the 
energy department should do 
it mainly addressed the hazardouswaste problem not the 
radioactive waste problem said clawson who lives four miles from 
the plant theyve hardly admitted to anything yet 
celebrezze and glenn said the decree is historic because it gives 
a state a courtenforceable order with which to pressure the energy 
department to clean up a nuclear facility 
the decree also extends ohios jurisdiction over fernald to all 
state and federal hazardouswaste law and regulations celebrezze 
said 
both men said it is the first such agreement they know of in the 
nation 
the 37yearold plant has supplied uranium to the energy 
departments rocky flats plant in colorado the hanford reactors in 
washington state the savannah river plant in south carolina and the 
oak ridge nuclear complex the savannah river reactors are shut down 
because of problems there and the closure of the rocky flats plant 
is reportedly being considered 
the fernald plant has been halted by a strike that began oct 7 
energy department officials have said they expect production to 
resume when the strike ends but declined to comment on the plants 
longterm status a department report is due out dec 15 on the 
status of aging nuclear weapons plants nationwide

four people freed from a stalled elevator 
after spending the night said they kept their spirits up by playing 
cards and imagining worse predicaments 
the four were freed friday morning after more than 14 hours in 
the 4footsquare elevator in this mississippi river city 
we were trying to decide what would be worse than this karen 
nordgren 34 said so i asked everyone would you rather go into 
major surgery or go through this again we all decided surgery 
nordgren sandra lehmann 39 adeline kitty reinhart 59 and 
her husband raymond 59 said they shared vitamin c tablets and a 
common toilet made from a plastic shopping bag neatly tied and 
tucked in a corner 
nordgren and lehmann are beauticians at a thirdfloor beauty shop 
in the building 
normally we never take the elevator when we leave nordgren 
said but she and lehmann decided to enter the elevator because the 
reinharts were already in it and were holding the door for them she 
said 
the elevator became stuck shortly before 6 pm thursday 
i didnt think that i was going to get out of there alive 
lehmann said 
she said she eventually overcame her panic and tore a metal plate 
from a telephone box inside the elevator she then used it to pry 
open the elevator door so fresh air could enter the elevator 
the four were not discovered until shortly after 7 am when the 
owner of a business in the building arrived

a quadriplegic woman who says she 
makes 2000 a week playing an electric organ with her mouth is 
challenging the citys antibegging ordinance so she can continue 
her boardwalk performances in front of casinos 
celestine tates municipal court hearing was postponed friday 
but her lawyers said they were confident they can reach an 
outofcourt agreement with the city 
the 33yearold woman solicits money from tourists by playing a 
portable electric keyboard with her tongue and lips birth defects 
left her arms and legs undeveloped and family members move her on a 
gurney 
ms tate said she averages 2000 a week enough to send her two 
daughters to private school 
in the past several years she has accumulated dozens of 
summonses from police enforcing this gambling resorts antibegging 
ordinance 
on friday she was in court to face 23 more 
ms tates attorneys presented a motion challenging the 
ordinances constitutionality on grounds that it violates her right 
of selfexpression 
there is a constitutional right to express oneself artistically 
and musically argued attorney justin loughry 
city prosecutor steven smoger said he had inadequate time to 
review the lastminute motion and said it should be dismissed 
judge bruce f weekes agreed to delay the hearing to give smoger 
time to go over the motion and to give ms tates attorneys time to 
continue negotiating with the city 
i feel like my head is still on the chopping block because 
what they decide will determine my future and my life ms tate 
said afterward i believe that the lord knows somebodys rights 
were violated so he sent me here to prove it 
ms tate said that even though the matter is unresolved she will 
return to the boardwalk today to perform 
smoger had been prepared to argue that ms tate violated an 
agreement made with the city two years ago 
after a superior court trial in 1986 a subsequent lawsuit and a 
lot of publicity the city agreed to allow ms tate to perform on 
the boardwalk the conditions were that she must stay near arkansas 
avenue and obtain a permit 
smoger said friday that ms tate had done neither 
apparently she became disgruntled because caesars 
hotelcasino was hiring outdoor bands and it cut into her 
gratuities so she moved in front of fire doors at ballys park 
place casino hotel smoger said 
ms tate acknowledged that she failed to buy insurance for a 
permit her attorney joan freedman meyer said the city offered her 
standard oneday boardwalk permits normally used for parades which 
require a 1 million insurance bond 
thats an unreasonable demand on someone who just plays the 
keyboard with her tongue ms meyer said the rolling chairs on 
the boardwalk are only required to carry a 300000 policy and 
theyre carrying passengers 
smoger agreed with ms tates lawyers that the 1986 agreement was 
vaguely worded but even if this is resolved we still have to 
settle the charges he said

the soviet union will eliminate the infamous 
practice of forced internal exile in a planned reform of the 
criminal code according to a news report 
the newspaper sovietskaya rossia on friday quoted lt gen ivan 
katargin of the interior ministry as saying exile is being ruled 
out as inexpedient 
internal exile as a form of punishment dates to the czars and has 
been used against criminals revolutionaries political prisoners 
their relatives and during the worst of josef stalins purges 
people deemed socially dangerous 
whole populations have been deported from their homes to siberia 
and the far north including returning prisoners of war farmers 
during the period of collectivization in the 1930s and residents of 
the baltic republics and ethnic germans during world war ii 
katargin was quoted as saying exile will be eliminated as part of 
a revision of the entire criminal justice system the changes will 
reduce prison sentences and substitute fines suspended sentences 
and other lesser punishments for many offenses 
since 1980 the proportion of convicted criminals sentenced to 
imprisonment has dropped from 56 percent to 32 to 34 percent 
katargin was quoted as saying after the new criminal code is 
passed it is expected to drop to 22 percent to 24 percent 
according to the report 
it was not clear from katargins statements to the newspaper 
whether the reform would end deportation from the country as well as 
internal exile 
nobel prizewinning author alexander solzhenitsyn was stripped of 
his citizenship and deported in 1974 while human rights activist 
and nuclear scientist andrei sakharov was sentenced to internal 
exile 
sakharov was exiled from his home in moscow to the city of gorky 
in january 1980 for criticizing the soviet intervention in 
afghanistan he was released in december 1986 after receiving a 
telephone call from soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
exile has often been used as a secondary punishment following a 
term of imprisonment 
dissident yuri orlov who was sent to the united states in 1986 
as part of the deal that resulted in the soviets release of news 
correspondent nicholas daniloff and the united states release of 
suspected spy gennady zakharov spent two years in the arctic town 
of kobyai after completing a term in a labor camp 
some internal exiles have been sent to a specific area while 
others are simply banished from living in their hometowns or any of 
the six largest cities in the soviet union 
in the past some were exiled to a specific isolated settlement 
to find on arrival that the only place to live is a labor camp and 
the only food is delivered to the camp mess hall 
more typically exiles could settle and find work but for 
intellectuals scientists and artists banishment effectively ended 
their careers

dan bloom is asking children nationwide to 
keep their gift lists and instead write santa and his wife about 
their feelings this holiday season 
bloom a 39yearold author of childrens books and parttime 
teacher in alaskas capital promises that santa and merry claus 
will write back free of charge 
i want the kids to describe their families their preparations 
for christmas what they think the spirit of christmas is their 
hopes for world peace and most importantly to name somebody whos 
doing a good deed bloom said recently 
blooms heartlight letterline is not his first holiday 
letterwriting program 
seven years ago while living in the western alaska town of nome 
bloom invented the characters bubbie and zadie as a jewish 
alternative to mr and mrs claus he invited children to write 
bubbie and zadie and share their feelings and joy about the holiday 
season 
when i was a kid growing up in massachusetts i felt left out 
of the christmas season recalled bloom who is of jewish 
descent that was my main impetus to begin bubbie and zadie i 
thought maybe there could be something for jewish kids to 
participate in 
after news articles about bubbie and zadie appeared across the 
nation bloom received thousands of letters from children of all 
faiths 
in yiddish bubbie and zadie means grandma and grandpa and 
basically they are everybodys grandma and grandpa bloom said 
they represent the love that grandparents have for grandchildren 
and i think thats why it worked i think if i had created father 
hanukkah or something it wouldnt have been as endearing 
bloom said he was motivated to keep the program going by the 
wonder and spirit of childhood reflected in the letters 
i remember one of the first letters i got said dear bubbie 
and zadie do you happen to know my bubbie and zadie herman and 
sarah from cincinnati as if these grandparents in nome know all 
grandparents the childrens world is an amazing world he said 
bloom wrote a 1983 book about bubbie and zadie sales of the 
book which includes an address have kept dozens of letters coming 
to the mythical couple each year 
last fall he decided to apply the same letterwriting idea to 
santa claus to open it up to more children and to counter the 
materialism that has become part of the season 
theres a lot of these little mailorder things where for 5 
you can have a christmas letter sent from santa claus to your kid 
but its just a commercial thing and theres not much feeling to 
it bloom said 
as i see santa and merry they are everybodys grandparents it 
fits in i think with the santa claus myth 
santas wife figures prominently because spiritual things 
should be male and female whenever possible bloom said 
a little girl for instance might have something personal to 
tell merry he said 
bloom said his jewish background should not disqualify him from 
perpetuating a symbol of a christian holiday 
jewishsmewish were all related in this world and i myself 
believe in a philosophy of universalism im deeply jewish in my 
background and im proud of it but im a universalist in that i 
dont really believe in any one religion per se 
bloom said he will answer all the letters and plans to recruit 
friends to help if necessary 
i get enormous satisfaction in doing this

a lawyer who helped end prison riots by 
cuban detainees criticized the deportation of five men who fled cuba 
in the 1980 mariel boatlift as an unjustified normalization of 
relations with fidel castros government 
a federal marshals service airplane ferried five handcuffed 
cuban prisoners all convicted of crimes in the united states from 
birmingham to an airfield near havana cuba on friday 
they were the first cubans deported since a repatriation 
agreement with the caribbean island nation ignited riots at federal 
prisons in atlanta and oakdale la last year 
we hope to have many of these flights said justice 
department spokeswoman deborah vurstionwade 
its a tragic day for the aspirations of the cuban people to a 
free cuba without castro said rafael penalver a miami attorney 
who negotiated a settlement with cuban detainees that ended the 
riots this is normalization in criminal wrappings 
when the men accompanied by two us guards got off the plane 
in havana three of them knelt down and kissed the ground ms 
vurstionwade said 
she said about 20 cuban officials met them exchanged documents 
with us officials and took the five away on a bus she said she 
did not know where the bus took them 
the agreement with castro calls for up to 100 cubans a month to 
be returned 
about 500 are still in custody of the 2746 cuba agreed in 1984 
to take back carla dudeck coordinator for the coalition to support 
cuban detainees said in atlanta the others have been paroled and 
some have appeals pending 
a federal judge in birmingham is to rule next week on a temporary 
injunction against the deportation of 10 other cubans from a federal 
prison at talladega 60 miles east of birmingham 
the judge last week refused to halt deportation of three of the 
five who left friday the other two did not fight repatriation 
the three unsuccessfully took their cases to an appellate court 
in atlanta and the us supreme court which ruled 81 against them 
friday 
this is a giant leap toward normalization with castro 
penalver said its the normalization of our deportation laws and 
the application of normal deportation laws to the community 
for 30 years it has been us policy to defer deportation of 
cuban nationals until cuban rights were restored in cuba nothing 
has changed in cuba to justify a change of us policy at this time 
furthermore i think its inconsistent and selfdefeating for 
the us to send human beings who have completed serving their 
sentences for whatever wrong they committed here to the very same 
jails that the us condemns for the atrocities that take place 
there penalver said 
the cubans who fought deportation claimed they would face 
mistreatment in their homeland 
in the 1980 boatlift about 125000 people some of them convicts 
or mentally ill sailed illegally from mariel cuba to the united 
states 
fridays flight was the first since a 1987 uscuban agreement 
to resume deportations when the pact became known cubans rioted 
for 11 days at atlanta and oakdale with 125 people held hostage 
one inmate killed and massive damage to both prisons 
the five returned to cuba are miguel beitiasocarraz 28 who 
pleaded guilty to seconddegree burglary onel calzadogarlobo 43 
convicted in 1982 of attempted sexual assault charges involving a 
13yearold girl rene maurinoliva who pleaded guilty to theft and 
battery and hector hernandezquesada and angel meneseshernandez 
who did not fight deportation and about whom little was known

a fiveyear plan to open the us marketplace to 
products from the caribbean has been successful despite a 30 percent 
decline in exports from the region during the program a reagan 
administration official says 
when president reagan first proposed the caribbean basin 
initiative in 1982 the region was suffering from low export 
earnings declining commodity prices stagnant productivity and 
driedup private investment said elliott abrams assistant 
secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
now only five years later cbi countries are turning their 
economies around abrams told the regions leaders friday at the 
12th annual miami conference on the caribbean 
abrams blamed the 30 percent decline in export earnings on 
falling oil prices and said that aside from oil exports from the 
region have been growing 
although caribbean and central american nations have long been 
critical of lowered us import quotas for such traditional regional 
exports as oil and sugar abrams said washington sees such cutbacks 
as vital to the programs success 
in the final accounting he said it is the growth of 
nontraditional exports which is the most important and the most 
promising outcome of the initiative 
area nations become more competitive and less economically 
vulnerable with broader export portfolios such as flyfishing lures 
made in guatemala fine mahogany furniture in honduras and 
installation of free trade zones creating more than 80000 new 
jobs in the dominican republic abrams said 
while us commerce department figures show 15 billion has been 
invested in caribbean basin countries since the program started 
continued expansion will depend on efforts towards longterm 
selfsustaining economic growth abrams said 
abrams also credited the program with fostering democracy in the 
region 
the caribbean of the 1980s has been marked by smooth democratic 
transitions through open elections abrams said on the final day 
of the conference 
president reagan in a telephoned message to the conference 
agreed 
today freely elected democratic governments are in power in 
virtually all countries in the region reagan said in the call 
from washington through regional cooperation a totalitarian 
regime was ousted in grenada and there are now four thriving 
democracies in central america 
reagan attributed regional economic growth to the initiative and 
economic reforms undertaken by nations in the region 
the economic and political achievements of the region over the 
past eight years do not bear the label made in the usa reagan 
said these changes were made by the americas all the americas 
another vote of confidence in the program came from dominican 
prime minister eugenia charles who also addressed the conference 
anyone who says cbi was a case of us designs being pushed 
down our throats either doesnt know what hes talking about or 
wasnt there charles said

hundreds of shantytown dwellers hurled rocks 
at police who prevented them from storming the union carbide 
pesticide plant today the fourth anniversary of a gas leak that 
killed more than 3300 people 
police said they arrested at least 200 of the demonstrators 
protest organizers put the arrest total at 500 
most of the protesters estimated by reporters to number 1000 
came from shantytowns lying in the path of the deadly white cloud of 
methyl isocyanate that leaked out of the plant dec 3 1984 
a few demonstrators suffered minor injuries in scuffles with 
police who carried steeltipped bamboo canes but no firearms there 
was no sign of injuries to police 
five activists from the communist party of india broke away from 
police and scaled the 8foothigh wall surrounding the derelict 
factory complex but four of them were grabbed by plainclothes 
police 
the fifth succeeded in climbing a watchtower and briefly hoisted 
the party flag before police hauled him and the red banner away 
we want justice we want justice the crowd shouted in hindi 
some called for the public hanging of warren anderson who was 
president of the usbased multinational corporation when the gas 
leak occurred 
last year the indian government filed murder charges against 
anderson and other union carbide officials in india and abroad in 
conjunction with its 3 billion damage suit against the danbury 
connbased company 
the damage suit initiated in 1986 has bogged down in a maze of 
legal maneuvers in courts in madhya pradesh state which includes 
bhopal and in the supreme court in new delhi anderson and the 
others have not responded to summonses on the murder charges 
effigies of anderson were set ablaze outside the bhopal plant 
friday night and again today 
the communist party was the most visible organizer of todays 
protests but other opposition parties and activist groups 
campaigning for the rights of gas victims participated in vigils at 
the plant gates 
balkrishna gupta the communist party secretary for madhya 
pradesh state said 500 demonstrators were arrested 
police superintendent panna lal said a couple hundred have 
been arrested but we have not yet made a head count 
reporters who watched the arrested being taken away in eight 
government buses estimated the total at 400 
police sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
demonstrators would be released without charge within a few hours 
such detentions are legal under indian law and are commonly used to 
break up protests 
about 500 uniformed police were on hand for the demonstration 
some had tear gas but did not use it 
the government says the official death toll from the 1984 gas 
leak has reached 3329 
gas relief commissioner s saytam a state official whose office 
records the deaths and administers relief said gas victims continue 
to die at a rate of at least one a day 
about 20000 survivors still suffer from exposure to the gas 
most say they have respiratory and eye problems 
union carbide said the leak was caused by sabotage by a 
disgruntled employee

a proposal for direct talks between 
tibetan and chinese leaders on the future of tibet is running into 
serious difficulties sources close to tibets governmentinexile 
said today 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the chinese 
appear reluctant to meet in geneva in january as proposed by the 
tibetans and would prefer to meet in beijing a venue long rejected 
by the tibetan side 
the sources suggested a beijing venue would portray the tibetan 
issue as an internal chinese matter rather than an international 
one that could be perceived as chinese recognition of tibetan 
demands for selfrule 
china invaded tibet in 1949 and annexed it a year later 
many tibetans have long insisted on independence for their 
himalayan mountain region but their spiritual and temporal leader 
the dalai lama suggested in june that tibet could become a 
selfgoverning democratic politicial entity in association with 
china 
in his biggest concession so far the dalai lama also said china 
could continue to handle tibets foreign relations and keep troops 
on tibetan soil 
senior tibetan officials in india declined to confirm the reports 
that the chinese were reluctant to meet in geneva but lodi gyari 
minister for information and international relations in the 
selfstyled governmentinexile said we are not denying them 
the chinese embassy in new delhi had no reply to the report the 
embassys chief spokeswoman was out of town and an aide said no one 
else could comment 
the reports of chinese reluctance to meet a tibetan delegation in 
geneva surfaced after the dalai lamas cabinet convened a special 
meeting in dharmsala on nov 25 the meeting was attended by the 
dalai lamas elder brother gyalo thondup who had just returned 
from beijing 
thondup a hong kongbased businessman has long served as a 
gobetween for the tibetans and chinese

the federal government has reversed its policy 
of counting loans as income for welfare recipients after a nevada 
lawsuit showed the practice violated the law since its inception 
five years ago officials said 
the lawsuit and similar cases in other states including 
california prompted the us department of health and human 
services to chang the policy tuesday according to a motion filed 
friday in us district court 
we feel good we feel real good said attorney jon sasser of 
nevada legal services which represents poor people 
health and human services spokesman campbell gardett said he 
could not say how many people nationally would be affected by the 
policy change 
the motion filed by assistant us attorney brian sullivan asked 
judge edward c reed to delay a final decision in the 1986 
classaction lawsuit filed by nevada legal services on behalf of 
state residents denied benefits under the loan policy 
the health and human services department was named as a third 
party in the lawsuit but was not involved in a proposed settlement 
between the state and nevada legal services 
anticipating the judges ruling against the federal government in 
the case attorneys for the federal agency requested a 30day delay 
in a final order so they also could work out a settlement 
the proposed settlement which must be approved by reed was 
filed wednesday 
in the proposed settlement nevada agreed to repay 60 people 
11767 for welfare payments that were denied when personal loans 
were counted as income making them ineligible for benefits 
deputy state welfare division administrator michael willden said 
he was pleased by the federal governments latest move 
the welfare division had disagreed with the loanasincome policy 
since federal authorities forced it on the states in 1983 he said 
the aid to dependent children program is funded 50 percent by the 
federal government 
the loans should have never been counted willden said but 
we had no choice we would have lost our federal funding i think 
this lawsuit did turn the policy around 
it was clearly shown that the administrations regulations were 
violating the welfare laws 
willden said it cost nevada more than 40000 to locate people 
unqualified for welfare benefits by the loan policy 
initial estimates showed as many as 3000 people in nevada might 
have been affected by the policy but most could not be found 
last year reed issued a preliminary injunction preventing the 
welfare division from counting loans as income in determining 
benefit eligibility pending the outcome of the lawsuit

a federal judge agreed to decide if 
the united states was at war with nicaragua in the mid1980s the 
key issue in the case against six men accused of illegally providing 
military aid to the contras 
in a pretrial hearing friday the defendants argued that the 
neutrality act under which they were indicted applies only to 
nations with which the nation is at peace and said the united 
states conducted a de facto war against nicaraguas sandinista 
government they are asking that the case against them be dismissed 
us district judge norman c roettger held the hearing on the 
atpeace issue over the objections of the us attorneys 
office which sought to delay the matter until the trial 
it will indeed be an historical decision whatever the court 
determines said defense attorney david savitz 
roettger continued the hearing until jan 5 and said he would 
decide the issue shortly thereafter 
the defense friday presented volumes of irancontra committee and 
tower commission reports to back up its contention that even during 
the periods when congress halted military aid to the rebels the 
reagan administration continued to run a war against the sandinistas 
contra leader adolfo calero whose brother mario calero is one of 
the defendants took the stand to testify that former national 
security council aide oliver north provided the rebels with 32 
million during the congressional cutoff much of which was spent on 
arms 
he said us support actually increased during the 198485 period 
of the aid cutoff and the defendants alleged illegal activities 
they told us that the president of the united states would 
continue to solicit funds for us sai adolfo calero they said 
they would continue to support us and that we should not give up 
assistant us attorney eric debelier tried to draw distinctions 
between nicaragua and other us military actions including the 
vietnam war saying that in those cases the executive branch 
received congressional support 
the judge seemed to dismiss that argument however mentioning 
korea vietnam the persian gulf afghanistan and raids on iran and 
libya 
the only distinction with the nicaraguan situation is that you 
have one branch of government expressing its displeasure roettger 
said 
debelier noted that much of the testimony regarding support for 
the contras revolved around commitments made and privately raised 
funds provided by north who is under indictment for his role in 
aiding the rebels 
you cant say that because two or three members of the 
executive branch are going to solicit funds for the contras that is 
the same as binding the government to warlike activities in 
nicaragua the prosecutor said 
the group was indicted in june after charges of reagan 
administration footdragging during the highly publicized 
investigation opponents of aid to the contras accused attorney 
general edwin meese iii of stalling the case because it threatened 
to uncover illegal activities by north 
when the indictment along with a similar one filed against six 
other men accused of running a contra training camp in the 
everglades was finally made public it accused contra supporters 
of violating the neutrality act by launching operations against the 
sandinista government from us soil from october 1984 to march 1985 
the seven original defentants were thomas posey head of the 
alabamabased civilian material assistance group mario calero a 
former supply manager for the rebels joe adams adolfo caleros 
former bodyguard jack terrell a former mercenary who turned 
against the effort and went to authorities maco stewart a wealthy 
former texas businessman and state official who now lives in france 
jose coutin a miami cuban and former cma liaison in florida and 
alex martinez a conservative cubanamerican stockbroker 
the indictment accuses them of recruiting and training 
mercenaries to fight with contras supplying them with equipment 
leading them on expeditions including one aimed at blowing up a 
nicaraguan bridge and violating firearms laws 
stewart allegedly financed some of the activities 
some of the defendants including terrell and posey have 
produced documents showing the fbi and other agencies were aware of 
their activities and have said that knowledge of their activities 
went all the way to the white house 
adams pleaded guilty he was fined 50 and sentenced to a day of 
probation the other six defendants continue to fight the charges

joel steinberg admitted knocking his illegally 
adopted daughter lisa to the floor on the night prosecutors say he 
beat the 6yearold to death his former livein lover testified at 
his murder trial 
i knocked her down and she didnt want to get up again this 
staring business by lisa had gotten to be too much hedda 
nussbaum quoted steinberg as saying 
the conversation during a cocainesmoking session a few hours 
after the incident the night of nov 1 1987 ms nussbaum testified 
friday in state court 
the next morning steinberg sounded frantic as he called for 
her ms nussbaum said and i came running back into the bedroom 
and he said she stopped breathing and he was frantically trying 
to revive her 
minutes later she said steinberg told her to call the 911 
emergency number and she did the unconscious girl was taken to a 
hospital where she died three days later of a brain hemorrhage 
ms nussbaum 46 is the key prosecution witness against 
steinberg her testimony was the first the jury has heard directly 
implicating him in the blows that the prosecution says killed the 
girl 
steinberg a 47yearold disbarred lawyer is charged with 
seconddegree murder ms nussbaum was also arrested after lisas 
death but charges against her were dropped and she agreed to 
testify against him 
ms nussbaum said steinberg had angrily accused lisa of 
practicing a stare that was supposed to hypnotize the person 
stared at 
in her second day of testimony ms nussbaum said she once viewed 
steinberg as godlike and tried to protect him when he severely 
beat and brainwashed her 
speaking deliberately ms nussbaum said she was cut off for 
years from her family and friends during one period steinberg 
forbade her from leaving their apartment without his permission she 
lost her job as an editor at random house after repeatedly missing 
work because of black eyes she said 
most of the time he made me sleep on the floor or in the 
bathtub if i had displeased him she testified 
asked about her relationship with steinberg in late 1983 or early 
1984 ms nussbaum replied at that time he began beating me 
severely 
prosecutors also submitted as evidence commandments that 
steinberg issued to ms nussbaum that came under the page heading 
my goals in terms of joels interest 
he also would force her to write punishment lessons much like 
an errant pupil writing each item 10 times ms nussbaum said 
among the things she was forced to write anger is destructive 
not constructive 
judge harold rothwax instructed the jury that steinberg was on 
trial for the crime he is charged with and not for being a 
particular kind of person 
the judge had agreed to a prosecution argument that the only way 
it could explain ms nussbaum was incapable of saving the girl on 
the night lisa was fatally injured was to show the extent to which 
she had been dominated by steinberg 
ms nussbaum testified thursday that she didnt call for 
emergency help for lisa because she thought steinberg had the power 
to heal the unconscious girl 
the trial is scheduled to continue monday

faulty installation and assembly of a jet 
engine by spanish air force mechanics caused last months crash of a 
usbuilt f18a hornet fighterbomber a newspaper reported today 
spains leading daily el pais said preliminary results of a 
defense ministry probe indicated the error caused the twinengine 
jet to crash and burn nov 7 in a field near an air base outside the 
northern city of zaragoza 
the pilot parachuted to safety a minute after takeoff when an 
engine caught fire and an antifire instrument failed to put out the 
blaze the paper said citing unidentified defense ministry sources 
the paper said the sources described the inability of the 
antifire instrument to extinguish the flames as very strange 
and made them think oil lubricants or some other material kept the 
fire alive both engines were new and had been recently installed to 
replace the original ones 
a military guard on duty at the defense ministry told the 
associated press today that no one would be available to comment on 
the report until monday 
the accident provoked criticism of the socialist administration 
of premier felipe gonzalez for buying 72 f18a hornets from us 
maker mcdonnell douglas for 16 billion the countrys largest 
single military purchase 
the investigation involved experts from the defense ministry the 
spanish air force mcdonnell douglas and us jet engine maker

the soviet union today published details of its new 
government structure that retains central control over the 15 
republics while attempting to compromise with their demands for more 
autonomy 
publication in all major soviet daily newspapers gave soviet 
citizens their first look at the final version of a political 
structure that will govern them beginning in march 
after an intense fiveweek public debate in which a quarter 
million suggestions were made for changes the supreme soviet or 
parliament and its presidium the countrys highest executive body 
approved changes in about half the articles 
the final project which president mikhail s gorbachev has said 
is crucial to his reform effort was approved thursday by the 
1500member supreme soviet with five no votes 
the reforms will establish a congress of peoples deputies 
twothirds by popular vote and a third by the communist party trade 
unions and other organizations the deputies will pick members of a 
smaller twohouse supreme soviet that will meet twice a year for 
four months at a time the current body meets several days a year 
the president becomes the head of the the defense council and has 
the right to conduct international negotiations and sign treaties 
among the articles apparently watered down in the final draft was 
one that republics opposed because they said it called into question 
their right to secede from the soviet union 
the final draft gave the congress of peoples deputies the power 
to make decisions on matters of nationalstate structure which are 
in the jurisdiction of the union of soviet socialist republics 
previous language had given it the power to make decisions on 
the composition of the ussr 
the new law establishes similar congresses of peoples deputies 
in the 15 republics as well but leaves it to the republics 
constitutions to outline their powers the original draft included a 
lengthy list of powers of the republics congresses 
that also appeared to be an effort to compromise with officials 
from the republics especially estonia estonian president arnold 
ruutel in a speech to the supreme soviet said the republic did not 
want to be forced to form a congress of peoples deputies 
it is impossible to find an optimum political system for all 
regions of the country ruutel said so we have created our 
own 
estonia has led opposition to the constitutional changes on nov 
16 its supreme soviet made a declaration of sovereignty in 
internal affairs and proclaimed its right to approve all new 
national laws 
the national government declared the move unconstitutional 
the final version of the law gives the republics more 
representatives in the soviet of nationalities one of the two 
houses of the supreme soviet and also ensures they be represented 
on a new constitutional oversight commission 
it orders directives of the central government to be published in 
the languages of the republics but it also gives the national 
presidium specific powers to ensure that the constitutions and laws 
of the republics correspond to the national constitution 
there were complaints that giving organizations such as the 
communist party and unions the right to elect onethird of the 
members of the national congress would violate the principle of one 
man one vote by allowing union or party members to vote more than 
once or even hold several seats 
the final draft says that in selecting the supreme soviet the 
congress of peoples deputies must make sure that members of the 
party or other organizations not be overrepresented 
gorbachev in a speech nov 29 told the supreme soviet it would 
have the right under the law to veto any order from him or from the 
presidium under the new law however the presidency still is more 
powerful than the largely ceremonial post gorbachev now holds 
the new structure goes into effect with the election of the new 
congress of peoples deputies on march 26 1989

the nations bicentennial inaugural festivities 
next month have something for everyone from glamourseekers and 
history buffs to children chocolate lovers and ordinary citizens 
trying to get in on the action 
we want to make sure that everybody who wishes to can 
participate said ownie mcbride a spokeswoman for the american 
bicentennial presidential inaugural committee 
george herbert walker bush will be sworn in jan 20 as president 
in the nations 51st formal inaugural ceremony amid us flags from 
1789 1889 and 1989 and red bunting recalling george washingtons 
inauguration 200 years ago 
the oathtaking on the west front of the capitol overlooking the 
city and the mall will be a solemn contrast to four days full of 
official and unofficial parties pageants balls receptions galas 
salutes celebrations and festivals 
stephen studdert director of the presidential inaugural 
committee has said the bush inauguration will feature more free 
activities than ever before a sketchy schedule released last week 
shows at least three major events for children and youth including 
a festival entitled george to george two hundred years 
some of the capitals best known landmarks will once again be the 
sites of inaugural balls including the national air and space 
museum the kennedy center and the grandly restored union station 
the inaugural planners goal of broad participation is in keeping 
with the open relaxed style of george and barbara bush but there 
will be glamour aplenty what with nine balls and innumerable other 
upscale events 
roll call the weekly capitol hill newspaper published a special 
inauguration preview section suggesting 10 places to throw your 
inaugural party and noting that for inaugural week a limo can 
be a must the newspaper also canvassed fashion experts at local 
department stores and concluded that inaugural dress this year will 
run to ultraformal sophisticated classics 
capital area hotels are pulling out all the stops for 
inauguration week guests with special menus patriotic decorations 
and individual perks including chocolate elephant lollipops white 
chocolate replicas of the white house and sixinch square chocolate 
pianos filled with sweets 
its a grand piano the lid is up the truffles and goodies are 
inside the piano where the strings would be explained park hyatt 
spokeswoman jan walker you can eat the whole blooming piano 
officials at the presidential inaugural committee declined to 
discuss how much money they hope to raise to pay for the 
festivities the price tag could be higher than ever before since a 
new law requires the committee to reimburse the pentagon for its 
expenses in helping plan staff and execute inaugural activities 
president reagans 1985 inauguration committee raised more than 
12 million to pay for its events but a congressional study found 
that the use of federal employees cost taxpayers another 155 
million 
the pentagon alone spent 10 million and used 8400 military 
personnel who served as chauffeurs and escorts musicians and 
coatcheckers photographers and even organizers of receiving lines 
the two exceptions to the reimbursement rule are the inaugural 
ceremony and a lunch for the president vice president and 
congressional leaders both traditionally organized by the joint 
congressional committee on inaugural ceremonies 
the committee will distribute 70000 inaugural tickets to 
congress 40000 to republicans and another 30000 to the press 
governors diplomats and other customary guests 
if ifs too cold to have it outside the guest list goes from 
140000 to approximately 950 the amount that will fit inside the 
capitol rotunda said congressional committee director mike 
ruehling he said preparations for an indoor ceremony will be made 
in advance which guarantees that it wont happen 
while reagan took his first oath outside the capitol in balmy 
55degree weather a record high for inauguration day his second 
inaugural ceremony was forced indoors due to a record low 
temperature of 7 degrees the parade was canceled to the 
disappointment of hundreds of thousands of prospective spectators 
and young marching band members 
there was one inaugural week parade in 1985 a rainbow coalition 
march down pennsylvania avenue led by jesse jackson a twotime 
contender for the democratic presidential nomination 
jackson capped the march by blasting reagan for taking from the 
poor and giving to the rich and characterized the inaugural 
goingson as vulgar expressions of ostentatiousness private 
airplanes and long limousines and 25000 dresses and diamonds from 
south africa 
this year the mood is somewhat different jackson lunched with 
bush at the white house last week and came away smiling im 
impressed with the vice presidents openness he said whatever 
i can do in some role i would

continuing strong ties with oman and renewing the commitment for 
stability in the region 
oman on the far eastern end of the persian gulf is one of the 
four arab states that has provided the united states with limited 
support facilities for its naval operations in the waterway 
the arrangements are a particularly sensitive matter in oman 
which shares control of the strategic strait of hormuz with iran and 
has the closest ties of any gulf arab state with tehran 
the omanis permit the us navy to refuel warships at a base on 
the arabian sea and have access to other facilities that us 
officials refuse to discuss 
carlucci after attending a meeting of nato defense ministers in 
belgium flew to muscat for a twoday visit at the invitation of 
omans defense minister mutassim bin hamoud busaidi he was 
accompanied by assistant defense secretary richard armitage and 
several other officials

operating in the arabian sea off oman on wednesday an explosion 
and fire aboard the huge carrier killed one sailor a second sailor

kuwait to meet with top officials probably for the last time before

a resegregation campaign by 
rightwing town councils is prompting many whites including 
government leaders to denounce racist practices that are legal and 
a few years ago were commonplace 
in effect the revival of hardline apartheid launched in 
boksburg and halfdozen other towns in the past week has provided 
whites with a mirror reflecting how blacks nationwide have been 
treated in recent decades 
to a large extent whites dont like what they see 
i feel so embarrassed to be from boksburg said pam berry a 
housewife at a meeting convened thursday by residents opposed to 
the conservative party majority which took over the town council in 
elections oct 26 
the council voted nov 24 to resegregate public facilities 
including the town hall recreation areas and a large lakeside park 
that had been opened to all races in recent years 
in the next few days several other conservativecontrolled 
councils announced similar plans one said it might impose a curfew 
barring blacks from the town of carletonville at night 
foreign minister pik botha accused the conservative party of an 
unnecessary emotional outburst of racism and said its actions 
could intensify the sanctions campaign against south africa 
discrimination based merely on the color of skin was wrong 
botha said 
yet bothas national party in power for 40 years has made no 
moves to repeal laws that require racial classification of all 
citizens that allow towns to bar blacks from public facilities and 
that mandate segregation of neighborhoods public schools and public 
hospitals 
nationalist leaders ousted the mayor of durban from the party 
recently because he favored integration of allwhite beaches 
i realize there are still whitesonly signs but the 
important point is that we are in a process of removing them 
botha said 
but in bothas home city johannesburg the national 
partycontrolled council has refused to integrate buses swimming 
pools and recreation centers the last major reforms in 
johannesburg say opposition politicians came in 1973 when parks 
and libraries were integrated 
pat rogers a spokesman for the antiapartheid progressive 
federal party termed the national partys attitude toward the 
resegregation campaign nonsensical hypocrisy 
if they really dont like it why dont they abolish the 
separate amenities act and legislate against racial 
discrimination he said i would give the conservative party 
credit at least for greater honesty in this regard 
many whites concerned by the boksburg controversy have for the 
first time taken up confrontational pressure tactics that in the 
past were employed almost exclusively by antiapartheid activists 
business executives have threatened to cancel planned 
developments in boksburg and other resegregated towns national 
sports federations say they will prohibit tournaments in those towns 
unless the aparthied bylaws are rescinded foes of the 
conservatives in boksburg are circulating petitions denouncing the 
council 
black leaders have encouraged a tough response to the 
conservative councils boksburgs black and mixedrace townships 
vosloorus and reiger park are boycotting the towns whiteowned 
stores to grant the council their wish for a white christmas 
buchanan jantjes chairman of the management committee of reiger 
park called on the national party to abolish remaining apartheid 
laws but he commended the government for allowing integration of 
many public facilities and for turning a blind eye to some 
violations such as the growing number of blacks who live illegally 
in whitesonly urban areas 
the conservatives jantjes said are taking national party laws 
off the shelves and dusting them off 
at the anticonservative meeting thursday night attended by 
about 300 whites the loudest applause a standing ovation was 
given to sidwell mofokeng the topranking local official of 
boksburgs black township vosloorus 
vosloorus is with you he told the cheering whites the 
struggle is ours together 
the next day mofokeng and 10 other black leaders entered the new 
whitesonly zone around boksburg lake in a protest covered by 
dozens of reporters but ignored by police 
clive derbylewis a conservative member of parliament described 
the controversy about boksburg as media hysteria and noted that 
public facilities are segregated in the constituences of many 
prominent nationalist leaders 
said another conservative lawmaker koos van der merwe the 
national party has opened so few facilities there is little for the 
conservative party to close

a soviet delegation arrived in israel 
today to bring home five soviet hijackers who commandeered a jet in 
southern russia and flew to tel aviv with a hostage air crew 
the 19member delegation will remain in israel until the five 
hijackers who seized a busload of children and then traded the 
cargo for a plane and 33 million ransom are extradited israel 
has not announced a decision on extradition but has indicated it 
will comply with the soviet request 
the hijackers were held in a prison near tel aviv pending a final 
decision on extradition a spokesman at bengurion airport near this 
coastal city said the captured eightmember crew would leave for the 
soviet union on sunday 
staterun israel radio said the soviet delegation includes police 
investigators and doctors who will examine the hijackers and crew 
some officials from the soviet union have come to pick up the 
hijackers said motti amihai a spokesman for the foreign 
ministry but there has been no final decision on the israeli 
side he added our policy is we dont see any reason to keep 
the hijackers 
israel has no extradition treaty with the soviet union but both 
nations have signed international agreements on punishing and 
extraditing hijackers 
in moscow soviet deputy foreign minister boris n chaplin said 
his country was grateful to israel for their understanding on this 
matter some israeli observers said cooperation on the hijacking 
could accelerate the process of reconciliation between the countries 
the hijackers four men and a woman surrendered to israeli 
police and freed the crew friday evening after landing at 
bengurion the surrender came at 615 pm 35 minutes after the 
aeroflot ilyushin76 set down 
the five soviets stepped off the plane clutching bags stuffed 
with money then dumped coins and paper bills most of it in 
american currency onto the tarmac to show they werent carrying 
explosives 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said the hijackers had a sawedoff 
shotgun and four pistols but one of the hostages flight engineer 
yuri n yermilov said the hijackers were not threatening and seemed 
quite goodnatured 
they were five simple criminals who wanted to flee the soviet 
union israels chief of staff lt gen dan shomron said at an 
impromptu news conference a few yards from the jet 
military vehicles surrounded the plane which sat under the glare 
of a yellow searchlight 
the episode began thursday according to soviet officials in 
moscow 
they said hijackers seized a bus with 30 schoolchildren and a 
teacher that day and demanded a plane to take them out of the 
country the bus seizure occurred in ordzhonikidze a city 900 miles 
southeast of moscow 
in addition to giving the hijackers a plane and a flight crew 
the government handed over 2 million rubles worth about 33 
million and some food in return for release of the children and 
teacher 
chaplin and vitaly a ponomarev deputy kgb chief said the 
soviet leadership including president mikhail s gorbachev had been 
kept closely informed of details of the operation 
ponomarev identified the ringleader as 38yearold pavel l 
yakshiants and said he was a druguser who first asked to go to 
pakistan 
israeli soldiers said much of the money carried by the hijackers 
was us currency the soldiers helped scoop it up after it was 
dumped on the ground and the hijackers held tightly to the bags as 
they were led to the abu kabir prison near tel aviv 
israel radio said the hijack team was made up of two russians 
two armenians and a person from the soviet ossetian republic near 
turkey 
the soviets broke diplomatic relations with israel after the 1967 
middle east war when israel seized lands from moscows arab allies 
a gradual thaw in relations began in july 1987 when the soviet 
union sent a consular delegation to tel aviv israel set up a 
delegation in moscow in april

chinas breakneck economic development is 
endangering the countrys environment and saddling society with a 
huge cleanup bill the leading paper said saturday 
the peoples daily reported that if forceful policies are not 
implemented the nation faces a future of denuded forests dirty 
lakes barren grasslands and smoggy skies 
the report said the twin evils of pollution and misuse of natural 
resources have reached such a state in china that annual cleanup 
costs are estimated at about 23 billion 
by the end of the century the paper said if the 
environment continues to worsen it will become a major factor 
limiting economic development 
the paper said about 1 percent of the countrys 270 billion 
gross national product or 27 billion should be devoted each 
year to ecology 
but the xinhua news agency reported that by october only 18 
billion had been allocated for the purpose although it said the 
state planned an increase of 50 percent in coming years 
since 1978 chinas gross national product has jumped 100 
percent but the economic and industrial growth has come at an 
enormous ecological cost one which the government has only 
recently begun to realize 
a xinhua report said that by the year 2000 nearly half of 
chinas 2800 lakes could be polluted an earlier survey on 58900 
miles of rivers found that 20 percent were polluted and another 8 
percent seriously contaminated 
reports have blamed acid rain caused by burning the highsulfur 
coal that predominates in china for killing trees in hangzhou a 
beautiful lakeside metropolis south of shanghai 
in the countryside increased use of chemical fertilizers has 
seriously affected soil quality and water resources in addition 
timber poachers who raid forests for firewood and building 
materials have been fingered in the countrys continuing problem 
with deforestation 
the peoples daily said saturdays report was based on a 
fouryear study to forecast environmental conditions in the year 
2000 
the report said that even if forceful policies were adopted 
china would only be able to treat 53 percent of its liquid waste by 
the turn of the century it now treats only about 20 percent of the 
waste 
in addition the study predicted acid rain would continue to 
plague highly industrialized areas and the output of solid waste 
would more than double by 2000 
the report said that damage to farmland accounted for the lions 
share of the annual financial cleanup cost demanding about 97 
billion dollars a year water pollution came next accounting for 
42 billion in damage annually 
third came the financial loss from denuded forests followed by 
air pollution problems caused by chemical fertilizers and the 
destruction of water resources

soviet officials and afghan 
guerrillas today began informal talks on prisoners of war the 
future relationship between afghanistan and moscow and the future of 
the sovietbacked kabul government 
the facetoface talks in taif a saudi arabian resort 600 miles 
from riyadh were the first between the soviets and a sevengroup 
guerrilla alliance since the 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan 
the soviets have met other rebel groups on two occasions earlier 
this year 
formal negotiations were expected to begin later today or sunday 
sources close to the talks said 
saudi arabia was chosen as a venue by the afghan resistance 
groups because of the influence it wields in the islamic world 
the kingdom has said repeatedly it would consider establishing 
ties with moscow only after soviet troops complete their withdrawal 
from afghanistan the soviets intervened there in december 1979 
the head of the soviet delegation was yuli vorontsov a deputy 
foreign minister who recently was named ambassador to afghanistan 
the sources said on condition of anonymity 
burhanuddin rabbani leader of the loose alliance of afghan 
resistance groups based in peshawar pakistan has been in the 
kingdom for two weeks other rebel leaders were expected to join the 
official talks later 
vorontsov is the second soviet official to visit saudi arabia in 
less than a year vladimir polyakov another deputy foreign 
minister came in february in what was seen then as a move toward 
rapprochement between the two countrues 
rabbani has stressed that the overriding focus for the rebels 
during the talks will be on complete withdrawal of soviet troops 
from afghanistan 
more than half of the 100000 troops have left since moscow and 
pakistan signed a unsponsored accord in april calling for 
withdrawal 
the rest of the troops were supposed to be out by feb 15 but 
the soviets recently halted the withdrawal to protest what they 
called continued funding of the guerrillas by pakistan and the 
united states 
moscow and the marxist government of president najib are now 
seeking to convene an international conference to demilitarize

the social security administration has bottled 
up money to be spent on the homeless at the same time the agencys 
head is considering spending some 16 million on souvenir 
certificates a congressman complained 
the attack leveled by rep ted weiss dny at social security 
commissioner dorcas hardy comes at a time she is quietly campaigning 
for a post in the administration of presidentelect george bush 
however weiss chairman of the house government operations 
subcommittee on human resources denied that his criticism 
contained in a letter to bush was designed to derail hardys 
career 
he urged bush to reject the misplaced priorities of hardy 
weiss said he and his subcommittee have had differences with 
hardy on other matters at a time when there was never any question 
about her continuation in office 
meanwhile on a different matter hardy announced saturday that 
she has rejected a controversial draft proposal to narrow disability 
applicants appeal rights 
she said she remains convinced that the disability appeals 
process needs reforms but said the lowlevel staff proposal which 
was leaked to a newspaper two weeks ago before reaching her desk 
was not equitable compassionate or efficient 
weiss said hardy has not acted on part of a 1987 budget act 
authorizing 125 million last year and 25 million this year in 
grants for homeless outreach projects 
hardy has argued that congress failed to provide money for the 
program and that it duplicated other government services 
she recommended that the department of health and human services 
seek repeal of the program or find an agency more familiar with 
state grant programs to run it 
congress wanted states to use the money to find and help homeless 
people eligible for benefits particularly the mentally and 
physically disabled who are entitled to supplemental security 
income weiss said in the dec 2 letter 
its really the season that warrants it he said in an 
interview here we are with winter upon us there are people out 
on the streets who are obviously and clearly qualified for ssi 
benefits the purpose of the legislation was to help states reach 
out and identify those individuals we felt we ought to bring it 
to the attention of the presidentelect 
phil gambino a spokesman for the social security administration 
said congress not only failed to allocate money for the outreach 
grant program but in fact gave the agency less money in its overall 
budget than it requested for fiscal 1988 and 1989 
therefore we have to rely on other alternative means to reach 
the homeless gambino said he said employees at the 1300 ssa 
offices nationwide work closely with shelters and advocacy groups to 
make sure the homeless receive benefits 
commissioner hardy is very much concerned that we deliver our 
services compassionately and fairly to the homeless we think were 
doing a good job of it gambino said 
weiss called that claim baloney theyre not doing any kind 
of outreach that i can see obviously it was the congressional view 
that the kind of work that was needed was not being done 
he said there was no specific allocation because congress assumed 
the agency would fund the relatively tiny grant program from its 
general budget 
at the same time she was fighting the homeless program weiss 
said hardy was supporting a 16 million plan to send decorative 
certificates suitable for framing to social security 
beneficiaries hardy approved the plan despite a recommendation to 
scrap it according to documents supplied by weiss office 
its a nutty idea weiss said it contrasts what she thinks 
money ought to be spent for as opposed to what the real needs of 
people are 
gambino said hardy still thinks the certificates are a good idea 
but they havent been instituted we havent killed the proposal 
but it is not a high priority at this time based on its cost and our 
funding situation he said

president raul alfonsin said today 
the government will not negotiate with more than 400 heavily armed 
soldiers who took over a giant military base near the capital 
alfonsin who returned home from the united states today to deal 
with the crisis met with his cabinet and top military aides 
jose ignacion lopez alfonsins spokesman told reporters the 
president gave the necessary instructions to reestablish 
discipline and order where it has broken down and hopes that the 
problem will be resolved 
lopez would not disclose the orders but said alfonsin would not 
speak with the rebels as he did to end a similar insurrection in 
april 1987 
at the sprawling campo de mayo army base rebels remained in 
control of an infantry school surrounded by loyalist troops backed 
by tanks and mortars 
the government claimed on friday that the uprising in which one 
soldier reportedly was killed had been overcome 
however a spokesmen for rebel leader col mohamed ali seineldin 
insisted the rebels had only agreed on a truce pending alfonsins 
return from a threeday trip to mexico and the united states 
at campo de mayo on the outskirts of buenos aires talks continued 
between seineldin and gen francisco gassino commander of the loyal 
forces who surrounded the rebel position at an infantry school 
the rev luis jardin a roman catholic priest who claimed to be a 
friend of seineldin left the infantry school today and told the 
private news agency noticias argentinas the rebels had agreed to a 
truce of several days 
seineldin has not surrendered nor does he intend to said 
jardin 
the rebels would consider any movement of loyalist forces a 
violation of the truce he said 
vice president victor martinez was quoted as saying on friday 
that seineldin accepted absolute responsibility for the 
episodes and he claimed the uprising had ended 
the insubordinate soldiers at the infantry school at the campo 
de mayo now accept the orders of the army chief of staff gen jose 
dante caridi the defense ministry said in a communique friday 
but it remained uncertain whether the uprising was over because 
seineldin was permitted to return to the infantry school martinez 
was quoted as saying 
noticias argentinas quoted reporters at the base after midnight 
as saying they very clearly heard a series of 15 or 20 detonations 
of light arms fire the agency did not elaborate 
the insurrection began before dawn thursday when about 50 members 
of a coast guard unit armed themselves and deserted their station 
army officers tried to incite troops at one army base and another 
communications facility the latter two attempts failed 
the coast guard unit then drove onto the infantry school grounds 
friday morning joining rebel soldiers the government said the 
rebels also tried to free exlt col aldo rico leader of the most 
recent uprisings in april 1987 and january he is being held in a 
military prison pending trial 
machine guns were positioned at government house in downtown 
the navy air force and army remained loyal tanks and armored 
personnel carriers were sent toward the campo de mayo to quell the 
uprising gen luis caceres was quoted as saying by local news 
reports 
after firing mortars at the rebels which seineldin said numbered 
400 one officer was reported killed it was not clear from which 
side and about five soldiers were wounded the official news 
agency telam said 
a 19yearold woman was hit by bullets in the neck and stomach as 
she walked near the base argentinas two private news agencies 
reported her condition was not known 
the rebel demands were not clear 
the news agencies cited military and rebel sources as saying 
rebels want to end the prosecution of fellow officers accused of 
rights abuses during the 197683 military rule as well as gain 
better pay and equipment

one year after a fired airline employee 
smuggled a gun aboard a jet to kill his former boss traces of the 
crash that killed 43 people have disappeared from a cow pasture but 
left their mark on the nations airports 
since the dec 7 1987 crash of pacific southwest airlines 
flight 1771 all airline employees including uniformed pilots must 
pass through security checkpoints 
the fbi has closed its criminal investigation and the national 
transportation safety board is expected to issue its report this 
month 
in april the federal aviation administration proposed 
computedcoded cards that would allow employees only into areas 
where they work the system would reject cards of former employees 
and note when someone tries to reach a restricted area 
the faa has yet to require the computerized system said faa 
spokesman fred farrar but los angeles international airport where 
flight 1771 originated has adopted a similar computeraided card 
that gives security guards instant access to information about the 
employee who must also give a personal identification number 
the airport also plans to erect concrete barriers and fences 
topped with barbed wire to keep intruders off the airfield said 
manager steve yee 
could a gunman carry a weapon onto flight 1771 today 
nothing is absolutely impossible but it would be extremely more 
difficult to accomplish that said clifton moore airport 
executive director 
farrar also called it unlikely adding at that time he 
shouldnt have gotten through but he apparently used a card that he 
kept after he was fired 
david augustus burke 35 of long beach a 14year usair 
employee smuggled a 44caliber magnum revolver aboard the plane 
that day and probably shot both pilots en route to san francisco 
federal authorities said 
the cockpit voice recorder picked up six shots and fell silent 
with the plane at 22000 feet in seconds the bae 146 fourengine 
jetliner smashed into the pasture killing all aboard 
burkes airline badge was found amid the wreckage providing a 
clue to how he bypassed security with the gun usair maintains burke 
turned in his badge 
burke had been fired as a ticket agent three weeks earlier by 
usair psas parent company for allegedly stealing 69 in cocktail 
receipts raymond thomson 48 burkes former boss was on the plane 
investigators at the crash site found a note on an air sickness 
bag that read hi ray i think its sort of ironical that we end 
up like this i asked for some leniency for my family remember 
well i got none and youll get none 
at least 31 lawsuits have been filed on behalf of passengers 
survivors according to attorney mimi blakeslee many of the cases 
were consolidated and are scheduled for trial may 1 several cases 
have been settled 
in june a granite and bronze memorial was erected at a southern 
california cemetery where 11 neveridentified victims are buried 
bill hartzell has reseeded his pockmarked pasture 
youd never be able to tell that anything happened said sgt 
jim mulhall with the san luis obispo county sheriffs department 
it looks like any other hillside 
gloria gottesman of veradale wash whose daughter julie was 
killed in the crash said she remembers taking the 20yearold 
flight trainee to the airport a week earlier she watched pilots 
walk unchecked through security and recalled thinking boy if you 
wanted to sabotage a plane itd be really easy to do it 
like other relatives she remains bitter about the security 
system that allowed burke to smuggle the gun aboard it would be 
nice if it didnt happen if they were doing their job she said 
who can say its just a damned shame 
burkes mother said her son is missed i dont believe he do 
any of those things she said in a telephone interview from her 
home in rochester ny i dont know what to say what happened 
only the lord knows

voters in this country hardhit by a 
drop in oil prices will choose from two dozen presidential 
candidates in sundays election including a liberal frontrunner a 
conservative and a witch doctor 
opinion polls have consistently projected carlos andres perez a 
former president solidly ahead in the contest but with his 
leftofcenter democratic action party expected to lose its 
congressional majority 
independent polls gave perez a lead between 12 and 15 percent 
points until last week but aides of conservative social christian 
rival eduardo fernandez claimed early this week both had 41 percent 
of the those polled 
an estimated 10 percent of the nations more than 9 million 
voters were still undecided according to independent polls 
perez a 66yearold leader who nationalized the countrys rich 
oil industry in the mid70s has promised to seek decent repayment 
terms on the countrys 33 billion foreign debt 
fernandez 48 says he represents a new generation of leadership 
embracing an unconcealed sympathy for the private sector he plans 
to sell off many staterun enterprises 
besides the two frontrunners 22 other candidates representing a 
wide political spectrum from the first woman candidate to a witch 
doctor who follows a local spanishindian goddess also ran mostly 
shoestring campaigns aiming at least to get seats in the 244seat 
national congress all up for grabs this election 
the supreme electoral council which oversees the electoral 
process ordered all parties to cease campaigning friday and give 
citizens a twoday break before the election 
estimates place the cost of the campaign at some 40 million for 
each of the two major candidates 14 times the estimated per capita 
cost of the us campaign 
confident of victory perez paid no attention to persistent 
demands for public debates with his main rivals 
fernandez launched an allout attack the last two weeks accusing 
perez of selling out venezuelan rights in a border dispute with 
colombia 
perez charged fernandez of antipatriotism and 
irresponsible electioneering for bringing it up 
some of the minor parties stand to win greater representation 
this election according to polls a swing away from the major party 
dominance of that branch of government the gains could come at the 
expense of democratic actions bloc of 24 out of 44 senators and 113 
out of 200 deputies 
social christians are expected to at least maintain their current 
position with 14 senators and 60 deputies 
perez 66 who governed venezuela between 1974 and 1979 a period 
of unparalleled oil affluence could be the first to win a second 
term in 30 years of democratic rule the constitution bans 
presidents from seeking reelection until 10 years after their first 
mandate expires 
perez is responsible for at least half of the countrys foreign 
debt his administration undertook major projects to develop 
venezuelas natural resources 
perez aides have said the former president will ask for a 30year 
repayment period from creditor banks more than double the current 
refinancing accord of 14 years 
the foreign debt also was exacerbated by the falling price of 
oil which accounts for 90 percent of the countrys exports 
more than 50000 troops have been placed on full alert to ensure 
order at voting stations

space shuttle atlantis is carrying 
two space newcomers part of a new generation of astronauts with a 
look and background unlike that of the allwhite crewcut all 
american team who rode the mercury capsules 
nine more rookies have been named to four future flights and a 
new class of astronauts is in training to fill spots vacated by 
veterans who took other jobs after the shuttle challenger exploded 
on jan 28 1986 
the space program now has 93 men and women astronauts with a 
nearly even mix of experienced space travelers and those who have 
never flown into space 
within 10 years nasa is expected to add more as it responds to 
the demand of more shuttle flights and begins construction of the 
space station 
americas new astronauts are far different from the seven 
original ones 
the first us astronauts were all military test pilots all male 
and all white all jack armstrongs in flight suits 
the space shuttles with room for up to seven crew members 
opened new opportunities 
in 1978 nasa selected women and men pilots and nonpilots and 
black white hispanic and asian candidates 
the newest group chosen last year includes the first black 
woman astronaut dr mae c jemison a physician and the first 
coast guardsman bruce e melnick 
another group is scheduled to be chosen in january 1990 despite 
the loss of the seven challenger astronauts the number of 
applications has increased since the accident johnson space center 
spokesman jeff carr said 
the competition seems to have stiffened over the years said lori 
garver executive director of the national space society a 
washingtonbased space advocacy group of about 20000 people from 
the general public 
i dont know how it could get more competitve from the early 
days but it seems to have done just that ms garver said they 
have experience in all kinds of areas nasa looks at the whole 
person and what they have to offer 
the astroanuts are also more aggressive about voicing their 
opinions about quality and safety since challenger said astronaut 
charles bolden jr a marine colonel now people have no qualms 
about speaking out he said 
when challenger exploded there were 95 astronauts more than a 
dozen later retired some returned to their military branches 
others like sally ride the first american woman in space left 
nasa to pursue other careers 
fifteen people 10 military and five civilians were added to 
the astronaut ranks in august 1987 two of them are women ms 
jemison and jan davis 
it takes at least four years of training before an astronaut can 
even be assigned to a flight and crews generally are named a year 
before their launch date ms davis said 
i didnt understand before i came here how allencompassing the 
job is we dont just flip switches and follow check lists weve 
got to understand whats going on with all these systems said ms 
davis who has a doctorate in mechanical engineering 
vance brand a civilian pilot who flew on two shuttle flights and 
the apollosoyuz joint mission said there has been an evolution of 
sorts in the astronaut corps with a greater diversity of skills and 
backgrounds 
hee said he expects even more diversity in the future 
space is like the american west the arctic or antarctica its 
a new locality where you can do all kinds of different things

an exiled soviet engineer and an american security 
consultant say they are nearly ready to market an antiterrorism 
system designed to halt gate crashers with their own horsepower 
it is quite an old indian trap idea said alexander gorlov 
professor of mechanical engineering at northeastern university and 
chief designer of the terrorist vehicle arresting system which can 
demolish a 15000pound truck traveling at 50 mph 
the trap consists of two cables and a net stretched across an 
entryway if an intruder tries to drive through the tension on the 
net and cables rotates a 1500pound spiked turnstile that slams 
into the side of the vehicle forcing it against a barrier 
after the 1986 terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 241 
marines in beirut security officials recognized the need for a more 
reliable defense against car bomb attacks 
steel barricades that rise from the ground to stop intruders in 
their tracks have been installed at the entrances of the capitol 
the white house and many other government buildings in the united 
states and abroad 
ed newell a boston resident who worked as a law enforcement 
consultant much of his 77 years said those 1500pound barricades 
are difficult to maintain 
youve got to raise and lower that mass for every vehicle that 
comes and goes all day long every day waiting for 10 years for 
some guy to crash newell said people walk by and they see this 
thing standing there and it makes them think that these people 
inside have a bunker mentality 
in the system developed by gorlov and newell only the 150pound 
cables and nylon net that hang a foot off the ground need to be 
raised and lowered the cables slide into a groove in the ground at 
the flip of a switch to admit authorized vehicles and can be 
returned to position in one second 
the turnstile stands at the side of the road swinging into 
action only when a gate crasher drags on the net 
gorlov and newell have some testing to complete but now weve 
developed all the details and practically speaking were ready for 
mass production gorlov said 
they said believe they can sell the recently patented system for 
between 15000 and 25000 
gorlov 56 and his wife ella formerly professors at moscow 
universities were banished from the soviet union 13 years ago and 
settled in brookline 
he said he was exlied because of his friendship with nobel 
laureate alexander solzhenitzsyn who chronicled gorlovs brush with 
the kgb in his novel the oak and the calf

soviet citizens got their first look saturday at 
the fine points of a new political system that keeps a tight rein on 
the 15 republics strengthens the presidency and builds a more 
dynamic parliament 
major daily soviet newspapers published details of the reforms 
which were approved thursday by the supreme soviet parliament and 
will go into effect with elections next march 26 
the reforms adopted after five weeks of intense public debate 
attempt to forge a compromise between demands by the republics for 
autonomy and the need for central control by the government in 
moscow 
but a lawyer for a grassroots lithuanian movement scoffed at 
compromises made to the restive republics and said his organization 
was writing a complaint over president mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms that will arrive at the united nations about the same time 
the soviet leader does 
all the things that choked and are choking us are still 
there kazimieras motieka a member of the governing council of 
the sajudis movement said in a telephone interview from the 
lithuanian capital of vilnius 
the new system establishes a 2250member congress of peoples 
deputies that will include for the first time members of the 
communist party trade union and other organizations as well as 
representatives chosen on the basis of geographical districts and 
ethnic homelands 
the congress will choose a smaller more active supreme soviet 
that is to meet eight months instead of several days a year 
several of the 15 republics especially the baltic republics of 
lithuanian latvia and estonia have complained that the laws as 
proposed by gorbachev in october concentrated too much power in 
moscow 
motieka said the new laws give the national parliament wide power 
over the economy in the republics by including property under the 
jurisdication of the national supreme soviet moscow established 
that what is in our republic is not our property he said 
we cant organize our own agriculture he said we cant 
even change wages 
among the articles changed in the final draft of the reform was 
one opposed by republics because they said it called into question 
their right to secede from the soviet union 
the final version gave the congress of peoples deputies power to 
make decisions on matters of nationalstate structure which are in 
the jurisdiction of the union of soviet socialist republics 
previous language had given it the power to make decisions on 
the composition of the ussr 
the language appeared weaker but motieka contended that the 
change was in words only 
estonia has led opposition to the constitutional changes on nov 
16 its supreme soviet made a declaration of sovereignty in 
internal affairs and proclaimed its right to approve all new 
national laws 
the national government declared that move unconstitutional but 
the estonian parliament meets monday to discuss further expressions 
of autonomy 
the final version of the law gives republics more representatives 
in one of the two houses of the supreme soviet and representation on 
a new constitutional oversight commission 
it orders directives of the central government to be published in 
the languages of the republics 
but it also gives the national presidium specific powers to 
ensure that the constitutions and laws of the republics correspond 
to the national constitution 
gorbachev leaves monday for new york where he will address the 
united nations and meet with president reagan and presidentelect 
george bush he then travels to cuba and britain 
motieka said the governing council of sajudis agreed during a 
session saturday to send a complaint to the united nations a draft 
was being written and a vote would be taken sunday he said

george bush has sized up mikhail gorbachev 
during nearly two hours of meetings in moscow and washington and 
concludes that the soviet leader is tough selfconfident and 
outgoing a new and more enlightened leader 
at the same time there is nothing in bushs recent marks to 
contradict his yearold assessment that gorbachev also is no 
freedomloving friend of democracy 
in contrast to president reagans newfound optimism about the 
soviet union and its leadership bush had taken a more cautious 
approach the cold war is not over bush said earlier this year 
even as he praised gorbachevs reforms as revolutionary 
from his personal experience bush knows gorbachev can be a real 
crowd pleaser in bushs words a westernstyle communicator 
during the superpower summit last december bush was along for 
the ride in gorbachevs limousine when the soviet leader abruptly 
ordered his driver to halt jumped out of the car and plunged into a 
noontime crowd in downtown washington 
the campaignstyle stop delighted onlookers who rushed to greet 
gorbachev bush then a candidate shared gorbachevs limelight 
joining him on the street to shake hands and wave 
on wednesday bush will fly to new york to accompany reagan at a 
meeting with gorbachev on governors island in new york harbor 
although bush will be the man gorbachev will have to deal with 
after jan 20 the vice president promises hell play a back seat 
role to reagan in new york 
it will be president reagans meeting bush says ill be 
there as vice president of the united states and i expect theyll be 
aware theyre talking to the next president 
colin powell the white house national security adviser said the 
soviets understand that bushs role will be secondary to reagans 
and that it would not be appropriate then for the vice president 
to have a separate agenda 
even so the meeting provides an important opportunity for a 
smooth transition in superpower relations 
bush was the first american leader to meet with gorbachev after 
he became head of the soviet government 
as reagans emissary bush went to moscow in march 1985 for the 
funeral of soviet leader konstantin chernenko at the conclusion of 
that trip bush met with the newly named soviet leader gorbachev 
the meeting lasted 85 minutes and bush described their 
discussions as useful and constructive 
bush and gorbachev saw each other again during the washington 
summit bush was present in each of the plenary sessions during the 
three days of talks between gorbachev and reagan 
during that summit bush also had a private 23minute meeting 
with gorbachev at the soviet embassy in washington before the two 
men attended breakfast with other guests it was after that 
breakfast meeting that bush and gorbachev rode together to the white 
house and made the impromptu stop 
at the end of the summit when gorbachev went to andrews air 
force base to depart washington bush again was in the limousine 
with the soviet leader 
reflecting on the summit bush said gorbachev was an impressive 
man selfconfident gregarious and obviously intelligent he is 
forthright and direct and he has a sense of humor and a western 
style that makes him different from his predecessors 
but make no mistake about it this is no freedomloving friend 
of democracy bush said last december he is an orthodox 
committed marxist and a formidable and determined competitor for 
world power 
bush has praised gorbachevs move toward reforms saying i am 
impressed by the steps he has taken for more openness more 
reform however bush usually couples his praise with a statement 
that the soviet union will be judged ultimately by what its actions 
on arms reductions human rights and regional tensions 
in some recent speeches bush has struck a more conciliatory tone 
toward gorbachev 
in an address a month before the presidential election bush said 
gorbachev and his foreign minister eduard shevardnadze were tough 
but represented a new and more enlightened generation of soviet 
leaders in the kremlin much better able to communicate with the 
west more committed to openness and internal reform 
this offers promise but in no way should lessen our commitment 
to peace through strength a policy we must continue said bush 
in another speech a day later bush again referred to gorbachev 
and shevardnadze and said they are serious people they know they 
must change after 70 years of the marxistleninist state its 
pretty hard to explain to the soviet people why they dont have 
either bread or freedom why the food situation is worse than it was 
a decade ago or why life expectancy has dropped 
bush said gorbachev is clearly a different kind of soviet 
leader than we have seen recently he is prepared to take radical 
steps he is able to reverse course when soviet policies fail when 
the costs become too high 
a week before he was elected bush said that should he become 
president he would be prepared to meet with gorbachev at the 
earliest time that would serve the interests of world peace 
he said he would want to engage in a serious and direct 
examination of where we are and how we can best go forward toward 
further arms reductions a decrease in regional tensions and further 
adherence to human rights and thus toward a surer peace

defense secretary frank c carlucci met 
with defense officials in oman on saturday at the start of a 
fourday persian gulf tour expected to be the last to the region by 
a top reagan administration official 
carlucci was quoted by the official omani news agency as saying 
his trip was aimed at renewing the american commitment for 
stability in the region in the aftermath of the 8yearold 
iraniraq war 
he was to visit bahrain saudi arabia and kuwait and go aboard 
several us navy warships before returning to washington on dec 7 
us officials said 
they said a flight deck explosion and fire aboard the aircraft 
carrier uss nimitz four days ago was not likely to deter plans for 
carlucci to visit that ship which is operating in the north arabian 
sea off oman the accident killed two sailors 
navy investigators were trying to determine why a gun on an a7e 
corsair fighterbomber accidentally fired during an overhaul the 
gunburst hit a parked ka6d intruder tanker plane loaded with 4000 
gallons of aviation fuel and touched off a fire that damaged seven 
aircraft 
the arab states on carluccis itinerary have provided support for 
the us effort to protect commercial shipping during the gulf war 
which ended in a unsponsored ceasefire aug 20 
the omanis allow us navy warships to refuel at a base on the 
arabian sea and to have access to other facilities 
the arrangements are a particularly sensitive matter in oman 
which shares with iran the control of the strait of hormuz the 
entrance to the gulf and has maintained the closest ties of any 
gulf state with tehran during the war 
carlucci flew to muscat the omani capital accompanied by 
assistant defense secretary of defense richard armitage and other 
officials 
on saturday the pentagon chief met with omans defense minister 
deputy prime minister for security and defense foreign affairs 
minister and deputy prime minister for legal affairs the official 
news agency said 
senior us officials and diplomats contend that washingtons 
relations with arab states in the persian gulf are the best ever as 
a result of the american effort to protect shipping 
presidentelect george bush has said he will choose his own man 
to replace carlucci but he is expected to maintain the reagan 
administrations stated policy of scaling back us forces if the 
iraqiran truce holds up 
the us fleet already has been trimmed by two ships since the 
ceasefire to 25 at present by far the largest naval force in the 
region 
the number of fleets in the gulf will be down to four by years 
end as the netherlands and italy pull out the remaining fleets are 
from britain france and the soviet union 
us sources speaking on condition of anonymity said carlucci 
was to visit the nimitz the flagship uss la salle the missile 
cruiser uss josephus daniels and perhaps one of the six gulfbased 
us minesweepers 
the navy ended direct escorting of usflagged kuwaiti tankers 
two months ago but still monitors the vessels along the 550mile 
route between kuwait and the strait of hormuz

the atmosphere for president reagans final 
meeting with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has brightened with 
positive human rights moves in moscow and confidence here that the 
successful superpower agenda can be passed on to the bush 
administration 
gorbachevs decision to end the jamming of usfinanced russian 
language broadcasts and to ease restrictions on some jewish 
dissidents seeking exit permits symbolizes both an improved 
ussoviet relationship and the pride of place human rights has 
on the agenda 
steps by the soviet leader to liberalize the soviet political 
system are viewed more cautiously a foreign policy aide to 
presidentelect bush said he did not think gorbachevs 
democratization drive has any immediate bearing on the 
meeting wednesday on governors island 
but as you think towards the future the effort as it proceeds 
hopefully with application of the rule of law it is a positive 
thing he said friday this and the end to jamming are the kinds 
of steps that create a sense of hopefulness 
the bush aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said that 
even though gorbachev is directing a process of change soviet 
defense spending has not slowed and emphasized that bush intends to 
approach moscow with considerable caution after he takes office jan 
20 
the dec 7 meeting reagan and bush will have with gorbachev is 
apt to be marked by goodwill and as secretary of state george p 
shultz said last week some substantive conversation 
apart from seeking validation of the fourpart agenda that 
stresses human rights arms control and cooperation in resolving 
regional disputes reagan will prod gorbachev for a renewed promise 
to withdraw all soviet forces from afghanistan by feb 15 
mindful of the reykjavik summit two years ago in which a bouncy 
gorbachev pressed farreaching arms control proposals the us side 
is determined not to be taken by surprise by anything the dynamic 
soviet leader might place on the luncheon table 
we are prepared to deal with any surprise they may come up 
with lt gen colin d powell the presidents national security 
adviser said friday that is powell said we will take it under 
advisement 
that indicates reagan does not intend to swap sweeping proposals 
with gorbachev with only six weeks left in his administration the 
president does not intend to negotiate for his successor 
and bush even if he has an unscheduled separate meeting with 
gorbachev will not be president for six weeks 
behind the scenes shultz may meet separately with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze for what would be more detailed work 
than the leaders will undertake at luncheon on governors island 
we have no major new proposals to put on the table powell 
said i am not aware of anything they propose to put down 
reagan sent a report to congress on friday again accusing the 
soviets of flouting various arms control agreements with the united 
states he threatened to take some unspecified proportionate 
response 
reagan also said that unless the soviets dismantle a disputed 
radar installation in siberia we cannot conclude new strategic 
arms control agreements 
but he stopped short of charging moscow with a material 
breach of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty and he said the 
soviets corrected technical violations of the 1987 treaty to abolish 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons 
powell said the us charges were unlikely to be a major 
issue at wednesdays meeting in new york harbor 
the soviet concessions on human rights could do more than 
contribute to a good atmosphere for the meeting by putting an end 
to radio jamming and clearing the way for up to 120 jewish 
refuseniks to emigrate the soviets moved closer to meeting the 
us test for holding a human rights conference in moscow 
the reagan administration would like to see some other steps 
taken these include freeing all prisoners the united states claims 
are held for political reasons and allowing members of divided 
families to emigrate 
gorbachevs international political moves are also getting a 
positive though cautious reception here they are viewed as not so 
much an effort to promote democracy but to make economic 
reconstruction workable 
still the soviet leader plans to establish a new legislature 
with broad powers and to permit political competition although 
within the communist party there are a lot of reasons to be 
hopeful the bush foreign policy aide said

president reagan said today he feels nostalgic 
as he faces his last session with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev and will use the meeting to introduce his successor as a 
man who represents change yes but also continuity 
reagan in his weekly rado address delivered from camp david 
md said he was looking forward to the upcoming meeting and 
luncheon on wednesday set on governors island in new york city 
the president recalled that since he first met the soviet leader 
in geneva in 1985 the ussoviet relationship has developed and 
resulted in the first agreement to get rid of an entire class of 
nuclear weapons 
this will be our last such meeting and i must admit that i 
would not have predicted after first taking office that some day i 
would be waxing nostalgic about my meetings with soviet leaders 
reagan said in a reference to his days as an ardent anticommunist 
but here we are for the fifth time mr gorbachev and i together 
in the hope of furthering peace 
reagan pointed out that despite their agreement on arms control 
there is much work to be done over differences on that subject and 
on human rights regional problems and in bilateral relations 
the goal of improved ussviet relations must continue byond 
any single presidency or term of office reagan said adding that 
he is particularly delighted that presidentelect george bush 
will join the meeting 
no one is better versed in the details of sovietamerican 
relations or has a stronger foreign policy portfolio than our vice 
president reagan said 
so on our gettogether next week you can be sure ill be 
telling mr gorbachev that george bush represents change yes but 
also continuity reagan said 
reagans national security adviser lt gen colin powell says 
us officials expect no surprises at the luncheon meeting next 
week and that if gorbachev presents some totally unexpected 
proposal as the soviet leader did in iceland two years ago us 
officials will not allow themselves to be forced to make a snap 
reply 
the reykjavik summit collapsed when reagan and gorbachev 
disagreed over the soviet leaders demand that the us president 
substantially downgrade his star wars missiledefense program 
us officials were widely criticized after the october 1986 
summit with political opponents accusing the american side of 
having been unprepared to cope with gorbachevs bold proposal 
based on what we have heard from the soviets i am not aware of 
any that theyre planning to put down on the table powell said 
but i dont have obviously complete control over what the 
general secretary might suggest powell continued and if he 
does have some ideas that we have not heard before we will listen 
carefully respond or take them under advisement as the case may 
be 
powell also said that us officials have no major new 
proposals to put down on the table on governors island in new york 
harbor next wednesday

cambodian gunners pounded khmer rouge 
guerrilla positions in thailand and aid officials said saturday 
they have not been able to reach cambodian refugees who may have 
been wounded or killed 
the shelling was directed at an area inside eastern thailands 
trat province a border area where the guerrillas have herded about 
7000 refugees from the unaided camp of ta luan 
the communist khmer rouge the largest guerrilla gruop opposing 
the vietnambacked cambodian government apparently plan to use the 
refugees to populate areas of cambodia from which vietnamese forces 
have withdrawn 
the shelling peaked in midnovember in the most intense 
crossborder bombardment since 1985 on tuesday an aid official who 
visited ta luan and the nearby sok sann camp said he heard one 
shell a minute crashing into the forested hills 
sok sann camp is controlled by the the khmer peoples national 
liberation front one of two noncommunist guerrilla groups allied 
with the khmer rouge many of the hundreds of wounded rebels were 
taken to camp 85 a major khmer rouge military complex according to 
an aid official who quoted sources at site 8 the largest of four 
khmer rouge border camps to which the united nations has access 
the shelling has driven about 3000 of the refugees from the 
border back to ta luan but no information was available on how the 
shelling affected the refugees 
at the border the refugees had pitched platic tents while they 
built huts made of bamboo or papaya trees the khmer rouge told the 
refugees they must return to the border area after the shelling 
ends acccording to officials of the un border relief operation 
and the international committee of the red cross 
the officials repeatedly have asked thai authorities for access 
to refugees who may have been wounded in the gunfire 
shepard lowman president of the agency refugees international 
said thursday the us government should urge the thai government to 
restrain the khmer rouge the thai military has so far cooperated 
with the guerrillas 
we should encourage the thais though to increasingly press 
for greater access to those camps to ensure the people are treated 
in a humanitarian way not carried into cambodia or forced to serve 
the khmer rouge against their will lowman said 
relief officials said most of the shelling now appears to have 
shifted to the area around borai a khmer rougerun camp of 5500 
refugees not far north of ta luan 
sporadic shelling also continued along the northern 
thaicambodian border where the khmer rouge moved 5000 or more 
refugees from another unassisted camp otrao located in the 
northeastern sisaket province 
officials said the guerrillas moved the refugees to at least four 
border locations from which they were planning to move them to 
cambodian territory as vietnam carries out the withdrawal of an 
estimated 120000 troops 
the khmer rouge slaughtered hundreds of thousands of people when 
it ruled cambodia in 197578 
officials of the united nations which provides humanitarian aid 
to the more than 300000 cambodian refugees stationed at the thai 
border camps said they believe the 7000 cambodians alleged to have 
disappeared were marched into the cambodian interior transporting 
arms to the khmer rouge 
about 70000 cambodian refugees live in khmer rougecontrolled 
camps but their fate is largely unknown the guerrillas generally 
refuse access to outsiders

here is the text of president reagans radio 
address saturday 
my fellow americans theres a meeting in new york next week im 
looking forward to ill be getting together next wednesday on 
governors island with the leader of the soviet union chairman 
gorbachev this will be our last such meeting and i must admit that 
i would not have predicted after first taking office that someday i 
would be waxing nostalgic about my meetings with soviet leaders 
but here we are for the fifth time mr gorbachev and i together 
in the hope of further peace and always in my mind i go back to 
that first summit held in 1985 at a private villa on the shores of 
lake geneva at the first of our fireside talks i said to mr 
gorbachev that ours was a unique meeting between two people who had 
the power to start world war iii or to begin a new era for humanity 
the opportunity for such a new era is there and very real that 
isnt to say of course that that era is already upon us no too 
many fundamental differences on matters such as human rights and 
regional tensions remain unsettled between east and west but it is 
to say that there is the hope of an era in which the terrible 
nightmares of the post war era totalitarianism and nuclear terror 
may diminish significantly and please god some day fade away 
throughout the postwar period this has always been americas 
agenda that the blessings of peace and freedom we know so well in 
this country will someday belong to every nation to every people 
toward this end the united states and its allies have over the 
last eight years pursued a course of public candor and military 
strength but also a course of vigorous diplomatic engagement with 
the soviets and the soviets have responded the result has been 
progress on a wide series of fronts 
first and most obvious we have signed the first treaty in 
history reducing nuclear armaments indeed wiping out a whole class 
of us and soviet nuclear missiles so too other arms 
negotiations are moving forward in purusing this cause the soviets 
must abide by past agreements and in this regard the krasnoyarsk 
radar violation remains a significant problem 
in the area of regional conflicts weve seen a partial soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan and commitment to full withdrawal by 
february in angola us mediation has led to a ceasefire and 
prospects for a political settlement and withdrawal of cuban troops 
in cambodia steps have been taken toward a withdrawal of 
vietnamese troops and in other regions we have seen movements 
toward peace so too in our bilateral relations with the soviets 
there has been movement toward wider exchanges between our two 
peoples that bring american and soviet citizens in closer contact 
and communication 
finally but most important in the area of human rights we have 
also seen progress yes we welcome recent steps like an end to 
jamming of western broadcasts heard in the soviet union but we also 
are hopeful that talk of democratic reform and greater freedom or 
all the warsaw pact countries will become more than just talk 
we hope for example for a day when the soviet union will permit 
the publication of the works of solzhenitsyn or the day when the 
berlin wall will be no more 
yes we want bold words of reform about political and religious 
expression to become more than just words so for all the progress 
and all the hope the journey to this final meeting between mr 
gorbachev and me at governors island has been a difficult one and 
believe me the journey toward better sovietamerican relations will 
remain a difficult one yet it is a journey that must continue 
beyond any single president or term of office 
and thats why im particularly delighted that vice president 
george bush will be joining mr gorbachev and me at governors island 
next week 
now ive spoken many times about vice president bushs foreign 
policy credentials and his long experience in this field at every 
stage in the summit process he has been at my side no one is better 
versed in the details of sovietamerican relations or has a stronger 
foreign policy portfolio than our vice president 
so while our gettogether next week will not be a working summit 
with a formal agenda you can be sure ill be telling mr gorbachev 
that george bush represents change yes but also continuity that 
he stands for firmness and strength and candor in the cause of 
freedom that he knows intimately the essentials of the 
sovietamerican relationship and that the american people do not 
want treaties for the sake of treaties they want agreements that 
endure and help prevent war as the world moves relentlessly toward a 
new birth of freedom for all humanity 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

when dulal biswas heard a cyclone 
was bearing down on his fishing village he sent his 5yearold 
daughter shanti to her grandparents home for safety 
many of his friends and fellow boatmen disappeared in the storm 
tuesday night but biswas survived and gave thanks that shanti too 
was safe 
a few days later he headed for the place where shanti had gone 
two miles further inland on the way he stumbled upon a childs 
body on the bank of the pasur river one of the more than 1400 
people who perished when the cyclone struck bangladesh and india 
drawing closer he peered in disbelief at the bloated 
decomposing body then he screamed beat his chest and cried 
shanti my little doll shanti 
biswas incoherent with grief could barely relate his story 
most of it was told by a volunteer from the red crescent society 
the islamic equivalent of the red cross who was with the boatman 
when he found his daughters body 
ram chandra the village elder said biswas wife died a year ago 
of cholera and shanti was his only child 
chandra said six people died in shoron khola when the cyclone 
struck leveling most of the strawandmud houses in the village of 
160 people but he said many people perhaps dozens had set out in 
their boats to try to escape the cyclone bearing down upon shoron 
khola which is barely a mile from the bay of bengal 
those who stayed back and prayed were safe the 55yearold 
chandra said those who dared to take a boat are either dead or 
missing 
the cyclone came and a wave 10 feet high crashed over the 
river the wind howled and uprooted many trees and destroyed many 
houses the village elder said 
in bangladesh about 1050 people died in the cyclone a relief 
ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity said saturday 
in indias west bengal state which abuts bangladesh the 
official death toll had reached 410 by saturday 
the number of people still missing in bangladesh their fates 
unknown ranged from 3000 to 5000 according to newspapers in 
dhaka the capital 
the newspapers estimated between 25 million and 5 million people 
were left homeless by the cyclone that devastated 30 of the 
countrys 64 administrative districts 
the actual number of deaths may never be known communication is 
poor in much of the region and bureaucracy slows the reporting of 
verifiable deaths in some places 
in perojpur 65 miles northeast of shoron khola local council 
member hamiduz zaman claimed the cyclone caused greater property 
damage than one that killed at least 300000 people in 1970 
that cyclone which struck a year before bangladesh won its 
independence from pakistan in civil war confined its fury mostly to 
the coastal region while the latest storm reached more than 125 
miles inland 
our latest cyclone did more damage to the standing crops the 
infrastructures dwellings and telecomunications than the one in 
1970 zaman said in my subdistrict only 14 lives were lost 
this time but there was colossal damage to the rice crop and the 
mudandstraw houses many of the people are too poor to build new 
houses for many months 
president hussain muhammad ershad who toured southwestern 
bangladesh on thursday and friday to visit the sites of greatest 
devastation said his government will mobilize its resources to help 
the people 
but the government of this impoverished nation where the per 
capita annual income is 150 a year will be hardpressed to meet 
the task 
floods during the summer monsoon rains put threefourths of the 
country under water killing 1500 people and destroying much of the 
rice crop 
cyclones and monsoon floods strike the lowlying nation with 
deadly regularity most of bangladesh is barely above sea level its 
110 million people live in the thirdmost densely populated land in 
the world after the citystates of singapore and hong kong 
bangladeshis live in an average of 2000 people per square mile 
if the present birth rate is not checked the population will 
surpass 200 million in the next 35 years 
already according to un officials in dhaka bangladesh is one 
of the worlds largest recipients of foreign aid 2 billion was 
pledged before the summer floods 
the floods which started in june and peaked in early september 
brought additional offers of aid although much of it was not 
additional aid but a speeding up of foodstuffs seed grain and 
health care materials already in the pipeline for future 
distribution

just when the united states and the united 
nations appeared to be patching up an often thorny relationship the 
world body and its host country were thrown back onto a collision 
course by a us decision to ban plo chief yasser arafat 
in an action seen as a slap in the face to the reagan 
adminstration the general assembly voted 1542 friday to convene a 
special session in geneva so that arafat can address a debate on the 
middle east only the united states and israel voted against the 
measure 
in the past reagan officials have accused the united nations of 
antiwestern bias wastefulness and of running a bloated 
inefficient bureaucracy in need of reform washington has withheld 
hundreds of millions of dollars in dues to express its displeasure 
the united states frequently was denounced as imperialistic by 
developing nations which dominate the 159nation general assembly 
in recent years civility cooperation and equilibrium had been 
restored the united states praised the united nations and its 
peacemaking efforts in afghanistan and in the iraniraq war and 
noted its potential for peacekeeping in regions such as southern 
africa western sahara and southeast asia 
when reagan delivered his final presidential speech to the united 
nations in september he was wellreceived 
now some fear the reconciliation is in jeopardy 
does this spell the end of the united nations in the united 
states and the united states in the united nations wrote 
undersecretarygeneral joseph verner reed the highest ranking us 
official at the united nations who was deeply distressed by the us 
denial of a visa to arafat 
the move reed wrote in a letter to president reagan has done 
incalculable damage to us credibility in the world arena 
in denying a visa to arafat chairman of the palestine liberation 
organization the state department said arafat was an accessory 
to acts of terror by the plo 
un officials us allies arab leaders and most of the 
international community opposed the move they said the united 
states is obliged under the 1947 headquarters agreement to grant 
visas to all un diplomats and invitees on un business 
arab diplomats said the rejection of arafats visa application 
was an insult to the united nations 
this is the last hurrah of the reagan administration and has 
eroded us credibility with arab nations said clovis maksoud 
ambassador of the arab league to the united nations 
but he added that we do not think it will do lasting damage 
we fully expect the new administration of presidentelect 
george bush will be more pragmatic and less ideologically obsessive 
than its predecessor we expect the new administration to take stock 
of this unfortunate episode learn from the international outrage 
that it has generated and move constructively 
before the arafat problem the united states was involved in 
another international uproar this year over its efforts to close the 
plos un mission 
a district court judge in new york ruled the us move was 
illegal 
the episode soured usun relations most arab nations wanted 
to move the general assembly to geneva in protest and said the 
united states was trying to stifle the voice of the palestinian 
people 
apart from the plo problem the united states has been estranged 
from the world body because its total outstanding dues now are more 
than 400 milion as a result of the money withheld to protest un 
policies 
in september the reagan administration announced it would pay 
some back dues and make arrangements to pay the outstanding balance

hundreds of rockthrowing demonstrators 
tried to storm the closed union carbide pesticide plant saturday on 
the fourth anniversary of the gas leak that killed more than 3300 
people but police blocked the charge 
police said they arrested at least 200 of the protesters 
organizers of the demonstration said about 500 were arrested 
most in the crowd were residents of shantytowns across the road 
from the plant many said they still suffered from the effects of 
the toxic methyl isocyanate that leaked out of a storage tank and 
turned into a killer white cloud at about 1 am on dec 3 1984 
the crowd shouted we want justice and hang warren 
anderson the union carbide president who resigned after the gas 
leak 
a few demonstrators suffered minor injuries as they scuffled with 
police wielding steeltipped bamboo canes there were no signs of 
injuries to the police 
reporters estimated the size of the crowd at 1000 and the number 
of uniformed police at 500 dozens of plainclothes policemen also 
were seen moving among the demonstrators 
five activists from the communist party of india chief organizer 
of the demonstration scaled the 8foot walls surrounding the 
pesticide plant which closed after the gas leak and never reopened 
plainclothes police behind the wall grabbed four of the men but 
the fifth ran to a watchtower and hoisted the red flag of the 
communist party both the man and the banner were quickly pulled 
down 
police sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
demonstrators would be released soon without charge indian law 
permits police to hold detainees up to 90 days without charge 
demonstrators usually are held for a few hours or overnight before 
being freed 
the government of india filed a 3 billion damage suit against 
the danbury connbased company in 1986 but the case is still tied 
up in indian courts last year on the third anniversary of the gas 
leak the government filed murder charges against anderson and other 
union carbide officials in india and abroad 
none of the officials has responded to the summonses and 
government prosecutors have said they will try to extradite anderson 
india has accused union carbide whose indian subsidiary operated 
the plant of negligence resulting in the gas leak 
the company says the leak was the result of sabotage by a 
disgruntled employee 
at least two dozen effigies representing anderson and union 
carbide were set ablaze near the derelict plant friday and saturday 
according to the madhya pradesh government 3329 people have 
died from the gas and 20000 survivors still suffer from its effects 
gas relief commissioner s sathyam a state official whose 
department records gas deaths and administers relief said the 
victims are still dying at a rate of about one a day

nasa disclosed nothing but the lunch 
menu saturday as astronauts aboard space shuttle atlantis reportedly 
deployed a topsecret spy satellite that can peer down at the 
soviets through clouds and darkness 
the public spacetoground radio link was kept silent while the 
five military men went about their business on the second day of the 
mission which began with fridays launch and is under the control 
of the air force 
nasa said in advance it would break the silence only if major 
problems developed aboard the spacecraft 
by all accounts saturday was to have been the crews busiest 
day with the expected release of the 500 million lacrosse 
satellite but the only official word on the mission came from nasa 
which released the menu salmon ham macaroni and cheese and turkey 
tetrazzini 
sources have said the satellite is capable of recording sharp 
images of military targets in the east bloc weighing 18 tons and 
with a solar panel wingspan of 150 feet the satellite according to 
sources will help verify soviet compliance with arms treaties and 
serve as a radar eye for the stealth bomber 
the soviet news agency tass apparently knows plenty about the 
satellite reporting many details about it including the code name 
lacrosse 
atlantis secret mission began with a spectacular public blastoff 
from cape canaveral fla during a momentary calm in fierce 
upperlevel winds similar to those that halted the launch on 
thursday 
four hours after the shuttle blazed across the clear sky on a 
northward course mission control broke the silence saying the 
crew of atlantis is go for orbit operations 
that announcement meant that the spaceships cargo bay doors were 
open and the task of preparing the satellite for deployment could 
begin 
only military men are aboard atlantis serving under navy cmdr 
robert l gibson the commander the pilot is air force lt col guy 
s gardner and the mission specialists are col richard m mullane 
and lt col jerry l ross of the air force and navy cmdr william 
m shepherd 
according to preflight reports mullane was to be inside the 
shuttle cabin using the orbiters robot arm to hoist the satellite 
out of the cargo bay and release it when atlantis was in a precise 
location and position 
the procedure was so intricate that shepherd and ross were to be 
in spacewalking suits prepared to go into the cargo bay if any 
problems arose in releasing the satellite normally astronauts do 
not suit up for satellite launches 
once lacrosse is in orbit 240 miles high gibson and gardner then 
were to fly alongside the satellite until ground controllers were 
certain it was working properly 
the satellites course reportedly will often take it over the 
soviet union and eastern europe where it can observe military 
operations through darkness and cloud cover 
the crew also planned to conduct several experiments aimed at 
defining the role of military observers in space with reconnaisance 
a high priority according to sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
it is believed the astronauts will test a special optical device 
resembling handheld binoculars 
the tests will be coordinated with undisclosed ground exercises 
that could include troop maneuvers naval movements or ballistic 
missile launches 
the flight the second since the challenger disaster the 27th 
shuttle mission overall and the third dedicated to the military is 
expected to end monday or tuesday with the landing at edwards air 
force base in california 
nasa and the air force plan to give 24hour notice of the landing

the boy whose name was not immediately released died of bullet 
wounds to the neck and chest at ittihad hospital in nablus arab 
hospital officials said 
his death raised to at least 318 the number of arabs killed since 
the start of the nearly yearlong palestinian uprising against 
israels military rule of the occupied territories eleven israelis 
also have died 
israel seized the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from

social security commissioner dorcas r hardy 
faced with an outcry over possible changes in disability rules said 
saturday she has rejected the draft proposal that sparked the furor 
she said the draft had generated inaccurate information and 
caused undue alarm to the american public 
she said she remains convinced that the agencys hearings and 
appeals process needs reform but the staffsuggested proposal did 
not meet her criteria of making the system more equitable 
compassionate and efficient 
i believe that ssa the social security administration can do 
better and have therefore rejected it she said in a fourpage 
statement 
the furor erupted last month when the new york times reported the 
reagan administration was considering restricting the right of 
social security applicants to introduce new evidence upon appeal 
thirtyfive senators including one republican dave durenburger 
of minnesota sent a letter to presidentelect george bush on 
wednesday urging him to repudiate the policy change 
hardy in her statement said her agency is deeply committed to 
improving the hearings and appeals process to ensure that claimants 
receive fair timely and accurate decisions when appealing an 
unfavorable government decision 
she said it was important to ensure that the system is 
compassionate since most appeals involve disability claims she 
said people are also entitled to a speedy decision 
the agency gets 300000 requests a year for hearings before its 
800 administrative law judges and it takes an average of nearly two 
years to appeal a claim through the administrative process to the 
federal courts 
hardy said 80 percent of social security beneficiaries now are 
represented at these hearings by lawyers and the agency each year 
pays almost 100 million in fees to attorneys out of the past due 
benefits of claimants who win benefits on appeal 
more than half those who appeal disability denials eventually win 
benefits 
the proposal drafted by the agencys office of hearings and 
appeals would have required claimants to submit all evidence at 
least seven days in advance of a hearing before an administrative 
law judge 
social security officials said the draft had not even reached 
hardys desk when it became public it proved an acute embarrassment 
for hardy often mentioned as a contender for secretary of health 
and human services in the bush administration 
she said that because confidence in our policymaking process 
has been questioned i removed the draft proposal from the routine 
process and personally reviewed it 
disability benefit cutoffs were a major source of controversy in 
the early years of the reagan administration when more than 1 
million disability beneficiaries had their cases reviewed and more 
than 40 percent were ordered off the rolls more than half won on 
appeal and congress and the administration eased up on the reviews 
hardy was not commissioner then 
in her statement hardy said there is nearly unanimous 
agreement that the current hearings and appeals process needs 
reform in addition to our own concerns a vast amount of criticism 
has also come from frustrated claimants attorneys the courts and 
the congress 
to improve it she said we need an open and honest exchange of 
ideas we must explore all options and alternatives 
she said she has asked her disability review council chaired by 
dr john e affeldt to review the hearings and appeals process she 
also invited leaders of congress and all interested parties to 
work together with her to make the process fairer more equitable 
and more responsive to the needs of the american public

chinese foreign minister qian qichen said saturday 
that his soviet counterpart will travel to beijing for more 
discussions before the officials of the worlds two largest 
communist nations meet next year 
qian set no date or place for what would be a historic encounter 
between president mikhail s gorbachev and senior chinese leader 
deng xioping their nations have been estranged for three decades 
both sides agree believe it is important to hold such a 
meeting qian told reporters at the conclusion of his threeday 
visit to moscow for meetings with gorbachev and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze 
however there are some outstanding issues which necessitate 
further discussion qian said for that reason i have invited 
my counterpart mr shevardnadze to visit china early next year to 
continue our discussions 
qian who left for home saturday night called the disagreement 
between his country and the soviet union over cambodia a hot 
potato to be resolved before their planned summit 
china wants the soviet union to persuade vietnam to withdraw its 
estimated 120000 troops from cambodia where they have been 
fighting chinesebacked guerrillas for the past decade 
vietnam has committed itself to the withdrawal of 50000 of its 
forces by the end of this year and its remaining troops by 1990 
gorbachev told qian on friday he believed vietnam is showing a 
constructive spirit toward resolving the dispute the official 
tass news agency reported 
qian said china is ready to negotiate directly with vietnam over 
the cambodian dispute but he added that some vietnamese think 
cambodia is a dice to play in a game 
we think it is not a dice but a hot potato we think it is 
better to throw out the hot potato 
progress also has emerged on chinas two other requirements for 
improved relations with moscow ongoing negotiations have settled 
disputes over parts of the 2600mile border between china and the 
soviet union on another issue half of the soviet troops in 
afghanistan have been withdrawn 
the soviet union sent troops into afghanistan in december 1979 to 
help the government fight the anticommunist rebels under geneva 
accords signed april 14 by pakistan and afghanistan the soviets are 
to withdraw all of their military units by feb 15 
however the soviets have threatened to disregard the feb 15 
deadline if rebel fighting escalates tass said gorbachev discussed 
the afghan issue with qian friday but gave no details 
qians visit to moscow was the first by a highranking chinese 
official in 31 years china and the soviet union were allies in the 
1950s but relations soured over the direction of the world 
communist movement the tension peaked in 1969 when the two nations 
fought a brief frontier war 
qian told reporters saturday that china would like to normalize 
relations on the basis of peace and coexistence but without the 
close ties that once bound the two nations 
it is necessary not to go back to the period of the 1950s but 
it is also necessary not to return to confrontation he said 
during his 1hour40minute meeting with gorbachev and more than 
six hours of meetings with shevardnadze qian said the subjects 
discussed also included border trade and joint exploration of the 
soviet far east as well as joint use of the labor force

sri lankas president said saturday he 
will dissolve parliament dec 20 a day after presidential 
elections to give his successor the benefit of the views of the 
present electorate 
president junius r jayewardene also said he would call general 
elections six months ahead of schedule on feb 15 instead of the 
scheduled balloting next august he said new legislators would begin 
their sixyear terms march 9 
opposition parties and the powerful buddhist clergy have urged 
jayewardene to disband parliament before the presidential elections 
in an effort to end the ethnic civil war that has wracked this 
indian ocean island since 1983 nearly 10000 people have died in 
the fighting 
but jayewardene has resisted their calls saying he would 
dissolve parliament after his successor is chosen 
i feel that an opportunity should be given to the people to 
elect a new parliament so that the new president should have the 
benefit of the views of the present electorate the 82yearold 
leader said in a speech broadcast on staterun radio and television 
jayewardene who is ending a political career that spans 45 
years is prohibited by law from seeking a third sixyear term 
he and his united national party have been in power since 1977 
extending their terms through a 1982 referendum rather than a 
general election 
a sinhalese extremist group the peoples liberation front has 
called for the nations estimated 93 million eligible voters to 
boycott the presidential race charging jayewardenes government is 
incapable of conducting a fair election 
the front a shadowy group known more for its violent acts than 
its marxist ideology opposes a peace accord aimed at ending the 
5yearold insurgency by tamil militants fighting for a separate 
homeland in the north and east provinces it also wants an estimated 
47000 indian peacekeeping troops trying to supervise the accord 
withdrawn from the island 
sinhalese extremists contend the accord grants too many 
concessions to the tamils who are mostly hindu and comprise 18 
percent of sri lankas 16 million people the predominantly buddhist 
sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population and control the 
government and the military 
the front has vowed to kill anyone who supports the accord and 
has been blamed for more than 900 political murders since the pact 
was signed in july 1987 most of the victims have been government 
supporters 
earlier saturday sri lankan soldiers hunting for sinhalese 
rebels conducted a housetohouse search in the colombo suburb of 
panadura after imposing a 22hour curfew which expires early sunday 
more than 100 suspects were taken into custody but most were 
released according to a military official who cannot be identified 
under briefing rules the operation was called after authorities 
received information that front members planned to launch a 
nationwide strike next week in an effort to destablize the 
government 
in his speech saturday night jayewardene said political unrest 
had hampered implementation of many of his governments programs 
however he told listeners i value especially whatever i have 
been able to do to preserve the rights of my people to elect their 
representatives to point out their mistakes and to replace them 
through elections thus preserving the fundamental freedoms of 
democracy

saturday refused to negotiate with hundreds of rebel soliders holed 
up at a giant army base and surrounded by loyal troops and tanks 
returning from a threeday trip to mexico and the united states 
alfonsin immediately met with top military aides and his cabinet 
and gave instructions to reestablish discipline and order where 
it has been broken spokesman jose ignacio lopez said 
the president hopes the problem will be resolved in the course 
of the day but will not take any attitude that can be 
interpreted as negotiation with the rebels lopez told reporters 
the majority leader of the house of deputies cesar jaroslavsky 
who attended the meeting told reporters later that chief of staff 
gen jose dante caridi asked alfonsin whether his instructions meant 
that i must fight 
the president answered do what you must do jaroslavsky 
said 
caridi summoned army commanders to buenos aires for a meeting 
political labor and civic leaders throughout the country urged 
the government to use a firm hand in ending the twoday rebellion 
the third faced by alfonsin since his election in 1983 to replace a 
nearly eightyear military government 
all the weight of the law must be brought to bear against those 
who rise up with the arms the people gave them to defend the 
constitution said eduardo angeloz the presidential candidate for 
alfonsins ruling civic radical union party in elections set for 
next may 
at the giant campo de mayo base on the outskirts of buenos aires 
an estimated 450 rebels armed with machine guns and automatic 
weapons and led by col mohamed ali seineldin 54 remained in 
control of an infantry school 
loyal troops who fired several volleys of mortar shells at the 
rebels on friday surrounded the school supported by at least 16 
medium tanks and armored personnel carriers 
although the army provided no figures on the number of troops 
present witnesses said loyal troops surrounding the infantry school 
and in the base area appeared to number between 3000 and 4000 
the army said in a communique that four military men were wounded 
in exchanges of fire friday including a first lieutenant who was 
listed in critical condition a captain and two noncommissioned 
officers the army did not say to which band they belonged 
earlier news agencies had reported that the first lieutenant was 
killed 
local press reports indicated friday night that a 19yearold 
woman walking on the base was wounded by gunfire 
vice president victor martinez announced friday night that the 
uprising had been overcome but spokesmen for the rebels quickly 
disputed that claim early saturday 
roman catholic priest luis jardin who claimed to be a personal 
friend of seineldin left the infantry school early saturday and 
was quoted by the private news agency noticias argentinas as saying 
that a truce of several days had been agreed on by the rebels 
and caridi 
seineldin has not surrendered nor does he intend to said 
jardin 
seineldin a combat veteran of the 1982 falkland islands war with 
britain told reporters friday he and his men did not want to 
overturn the government but sought to restore military honor to 
the army and review the trials that punish the just and promote the 
guilty 
a radio station in the northern province of corrientes claimed to 
have obtained a proclamation from rebel supporters which spelled out 
demands 
the rebels radio provincia de corrientes said seek replacement 
of the current general staff and an immediate end to trials of 
military men accused of human rights abuses in a 1970s war against 
leftist subversives at least 9000 argentines disappeared 
during that time and are presumed dead 
the station also said the rebels sought special budget treatment 
for the armed forces army spending has been drastically slashed by 
a government plagued by deficit spending tripledigit annual 
inflation and a 56 billion foreign debt

the government strongly criticized 
australia on saturday for closing the yugoslav consulate in sydney 
and expelling its staff the state news agency said but yugoslavia 
did not threaten to retaliate 
assistant foreign secretary drago mirosic made the protest to 
australian charge daffaires peter shannon who was summoned to the 
foreign secretariat 
the foreign secretariat most energetically protested the 
australian decision and expressed surprise and embitterment over 
what was described as australias unilateral and unfounded 
decision the tanjug news agency said 
australia on friday shut the yugoslav consulate and ordered the 
staff of 12 expelled following a diplomatic row over yugoslavias 
refusal to surrender a security guard accused of shooting a 
demonstrator 
the australian government had given the consulate 24 hours to 
turn over the guard when the deadline passed friday its foreign 
minister gareth evans gave the staff and their dependents 72 hours 
to leave the country 
evans said his government reserved the right to claim 
compensation from yugoslav officials for the family of jospeh tokic 
16 who was shot in the throat during a protest outside the 
consulate sunday yugoslav national day 
yugoslav authorities said the guard identified as matijas zoran 
fired in selfdefense when several croatian youths began scaling the 
consulate walls croatians are among several ethnic groups in 
yugoslavia 
about 200000 yugoslavs live in australia 
tanjug quoted the yugoslav protest as saying 
the decision of the australian authorities represents an act 
which is inadequate to the character and level of the entire 
relations between yugoslavia and australia and inflicts harm to the 
preservation and further development of the relations between the 
two countries 
it expressed regret that the proposal of the federal secretary 
was not accepted for australia to abandon ultimatum demands 
and make possible through direct talks that a mutually 
acceptable solution be found 
yugoslavia also noted that no information had been received about 
measures australian authorities took to prevent further activity of 
profascist emigres in australia directed against yugoslavia and 
its official representatives as well as against the development of 
stable relations between the two countries tanjug said 
yugoslavia emphasized that the responsibility for the current 
situation in the two countries relations rests with australia 
it said it reserves the right to take appropriate measures to 
protect yugoslav interests and dignity but did not threaten to 
retaliate against australia for closing the consulate

european economic community leaders vowed 
saturday to forge ahead with plans for a singlemarket eec by 1992 
and reassured the united states and japan they will remain faithful 
to free trade 
at the end of a twoday summit on this greek island the 12 
leaders said in a statement that a unified european market will 
benefit community and noncommunity countries alike 
but they acknowledged that proposed changes including uniform 
valueadded taxes opposed by british prime minister margaret 
thatcher resulted in disputes that were causing their 
singlemarket plan to lose momentum 
mrs thatcher told reporters it was absolutely absurd to 
install such taxes after 1992 since the varying tax rates in the 
eec will automatically steer consumers to the best bargains 
i think the market will deal with any changes that need to be 
made she told reporters 
french president francois mitterrand said france stood firm on 
the need to harmonize taxes in the years ahead 
however west german chancellor helmut kohl said the 12 eec 
states agreed their 1992 single market project was irreversible 
the eec summit sought to allay us and japanese fears that after 
1992 their exports will be shut out of the lucrative market of 322 
million west europeans 
in their statement the eec leaders said 
the internal market will not close in on itself it will 
be a decisive factor contributig to greater liberalization of 
international trade 
the united states and japan annually export goods to the eec 
respectively worth about 66 billion and 42 billion to the eec or 
more than 25 percent of the communitys imports 
in their final statement the eec leaders said abolishing 
internal eec borders for travelers must go handinhand with closer 
cooperation among police forces to combat terrorism international 
crime and drug smuggling 
mrs thatcher has expressed fears that a frontierfree europe 
will attract terrorists and international criminals including 
members of the irish republican army which has units operating in 
continental europe 
the eec leaders also reaffirmed their guarded support for a nov 
15 declaration of an independent palestinian state by the palestine 
national council the plos parliament in exile the council which 
met in algeria also endorsed a un resolution that implicitly 
recognizes israels right to exist 
on nov 21 the eec welcomed the declaration but stopped short 
of recognizing an independent palestine 
the eec leaders agreed to send their un ambassadors to geneva 
for a planned un general assembly session to be addressed by 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat french 
foreign minister roland dumas said 
the new yorkbased assembly is to meet in geneva because the 
united states has refused to issue arafat a visa to enter the united 
states 
greece france italy and spain wanted to send the eec foreign 
ministers to geneva but britain the netherlands and west germany 
blocked the move as a result 11 eec leaders agreed to send their 
un ambassadors to the geneva session greece however will send 
foreign minister carolos papoulias 
the 12 eec nations are britain france west germany italy 
luxembourg belgium the netherlands denmark greece ireland

president reagan will meet soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev for the fifth time on wednesday closing out a 
relationship that has evolved from open hostility to the oldshoe 
clubbiness of rivals drawn by shared personalities 
reagan who spurned superpower summitry throughout his first 
term is likely to accord his soviet guest in new york the sort of 
personal adieu extended to britains margaret thatcher a remarkable 
finale to a rollercoaster teteatete that survived the icy gusts of 
geneva and reykjavik to transform national policies and nuclear 
arsenals in just three years 
some would argue nothing has been transformed more than the 
attitude of the president the longtime cold warrior who made 
rebuilding the us military his first priority others say the 
ussoviet breakthroughs are more naturally the consequence of 
gorbachevs dynamic emergence from a confusing period of leadership 
changes and stagnation at the kremlin 
i must admit that i would not have predicted after first 
taking office that some day i would be waxing nostalgic about my 
meetings with soviet leaders reagan said saturday in his weekly 
radio address but here we are for the fifth time mr gorbachev 
and i together in the hope of furthering peace 
wherever the credit lies the reagangorbachev relationship has 
moved from unbridled suspicion to grudging respect to that 
gentlemans club of two where according to reagan there is 
never a sense of personal animus when the arguments are over and 
now at a luncheon at governors island ny reagan will present 
george bush as his membership heir in that most elite club 
in his radio speech reagan made a point of pushing bush toward 
center stage 
no one is better versed in the details of sovietamerican 
relations or has a stronger foreign policy portfolio than our vice 
president reagan said 
the president said he will tell gorbachev that bush stands for 
firmness of strength and candor in the cause of freedom and that 
the american people do not want treateies for the sake of 
treaties they want agreements that endure and prevent war 
so on our gettogether next week you can be sure ill be 
telling mr gorbachev that george bush represents change yes but 
also continuity the president said 
while the administration has gone out of its way to discourage 
the notion that the meeting amounts to another summit secretary of 
state george p shultz has said there will be lots of substantive 
discussion adding that us officials would welcome forthcoming 
statements by gorbachev on troop imbalances in europe and the 
berlin wall 
since their initial faceoff in geneva in november 1985 reagan 
77 and gorbachev 56 have held three summits including the 
memorable meeting in reykjavik iceland when the two leaders 
actually discussed a deal to wipe all nuclear weapons from their 
arsenals only to witness the bitter collapse of their entire agenda 
spurgeon keeny director of the arms control association a 
private group focusing on nuclear arms issues credits the 
flexibility and the personal warmth of both men for the turnaround 
theres been a real change in reagans attitude toward the 
soviet union and theres no question that gorbachev is an 
unprecedented personality and a major force in russian history 
keeny said its to reagans credit that he recognizes this and 
has shown flexibility in his attitude 
keeny said that reagan stopped talking of the soviet union as an 
evil empire just as gorbachev certainly seems to have avoided 
any negative comments or demeaning statements about reagan on a 
personal basis 
but dealings between the two men have at times been very testy 
and each has on occasion stood his ground 
donald t regan who had a good view as white house chief of 
staff at both geneva and reykjavik said after the geneva summit 
that one meeting went awry when reagan raised the issue of soviet 
adventurism around the world 
there was a very fast discussion faster than almost a 
pingpong match with remarks going back and forth from one side to 
the other and gorbachev demanding answers from the president the 
president sitting back calmly saying i am answering you if you 
will just wait youll get your answer regan said 
he said gorbachev repeatedly slapped the table with the palm of 
his hand and then pointed his finger at reagan and asked who is 
threatening whom regan quoted reagan as saying later i dont 
think in many instances of this kind we erased the other fellows 
belief 
there was a similar incident at the close of the moscow summit 
early last june when gorbachev tried to get reagan to accept some 
language in the final communique about peaceful coexistence 
which us officials viewed with suspicion 
thenwhite house chief of staff howard baker told reporters that 
as the meeting ended all of us stood up including the president 
and the general secretary and the president and general secretary 
continued to pursue their conversation 
they were going at it pretty heavy and i was proud of the 
president baker said the united states thought the language was 
too vague and gorbachev relented 
just before the moscow summit reagan told interviewers from 
foreign newspapers and television networks that he considered 
gorbachev a friend as well as an adversary 
we can debate and we disagree but there is never a sense of 
personal animus when the arguments are over 
while reagan has challenged gorbachev to prove that his glasnost 
campaign of openness is genuine he also has said that the west 
should encourage the move toward change in the soviet union 
helmut sonnenfeldt an associate fellow at the liberaloriented 
brookings institution a washington think tank said i think from 
reagans standpoint that this whole glasnost and perestroika 
concept came to mean that gorbachev was beginning to see the 
light about failings in soviet system

senate majority leader george mitchell said 
saturday that the united nations decision to move a general 
assembly meeting to geneva was a regrettable action 
mitchell dmaine commented in an interview a day after the un 
voted to move the session to permit yasser arafat chairman of the 
palestine liberation organization to speak to the general assembly 
the decision came after secretary of state george p shultz 
barred arafat from entering the united states home of the un 
because of what shultz said was arafats support for terrorism 
i think its a regrettable action mitchell said of the un 
decision it represents for the united states an isolation and 
will of course remove the debate from the united states at least for 
a period of time 
mitchell said shultz decision was clear and concise and 
welltaken 
as for the effort to broker a peace treaty the mideast mitchell 
said i dont think it derails the peace process its been very 
diffuclt of course there have been a number of obstacles over time 
and were going to work to continue to do what we can to encourage 
direct negotiations between the parties 
earlier in the democratic response to president reagans weekly 
radio address mitchell pledged to cooperate with presidentelect 
george bush when bush takes office next month 
noting that the white house will be controlled by republicans 
while democrats run congress mitchell said power will be shared 
some say this renders our government impotent that could happen 
but it doesnt have to 
the larger objective is to provide to our people the greatest 
possible individual liberty and economic opportunity our system 
divided or not can do that he said 
it is our joint responsibility president and congress to 
meet the challenges facing our nation in the way that best serves 
all our people he siad of course we have differences and 
there will be disagreements it wouldnt be democracy if we didnt

president mikhail s gorbachev sets out this week 
on a trip to the united states cuba and britain that will grab 
headlines around the world and may distract some attention from his 
problems at home 
the soviet leader is juggling ethnic violence in the south 
nationalist fever in the baltic republics to the north and a 
pervasive sense that food and other essentials are becoming more 
difficult to find despite his promise that perestroika will make 
life better 
the fires he is trying to control are breaking out at least in 
part because his new tolerance for dissent permits the fanning of 
longsmoldering embers without the harsh policestate crackdowns 
that would have been inevitable here only a few years ago 
at the same time gorbachev is moving ahead with the overhaul of 
the political system that he insists is needed in order to 
institutionalize democracy and block the bureaucracy from sliding 
back into stagnation 
some western diplomats have suggested the soviet presidents 
travels are aimed at bolstering his image as a world leader at a 
time when chronic food shortages and public opposition raise 
questions about the success of his administration at home 
but both soviet and western analysts agree the trip is likely to 
buttress his efforts to integrate the soviet union into the world 
community and advance the improvement in eastwest relations that 
they say is the first step on a long road toward reordering 
domestic priorities in order to divert huge sums now allocated to 
defense and military aid and direct them toward improving the 
quality and availability of goods and services at home 
its reasonable to think that part of the motivation for the 
trip is to polish his image as a leader and effective statesman 
abroad said one western diplomat who studies soviet affairs but 
asked not to be identified the prestige that goes with all of 
that may help him play a role and could cause a certain distraction 
from domestic problems that seem so difficult to move or resolve 
but the western analyst and a soviet foreign affairs specialist 
who also spoke on condition of anonymity agreed that gorbachevs 
trip is consistent with his stated goal of pressing for improved 
relations with the west in order to build and new and better life 
for his people at home 
the soviet union doesnt have the resources to sustain the 
investment its been making in foreign aid and defense the 
diplomat said adding the government must apply those resources to 
domestic problems if gorbachevs reform program which he calls 
perestroika or restructuring is to succeed 
the source noted that western intelligence estimates place soviet 
defense spending at 15 percent to 25 percent of the nations gross 
national product which is at least 25 times the comparable ratio 
spent by the united states 
even the lower end of that range would be enormous by world 
standards the analyst said the upper end would be truly 
staggering 
but beyond the numbers the source added the military now 
monopolizes the nations scientific and technological resources 
leaving the rest of soviet society relatively impoverished and 
unable to pull itself out of its backwardness 
the soviet source in a separate interview said gorbachevs trip 
will be aimed largely at dispelling the image many in the west share 
of the soviet union as an enemy 
we cant afford to finance revolution anymore the source 
said now we must settle these regional conflicts and develop 
friendly relations with those who want to see us at the enemy 
gorbachev only recently disclosed his plan to address the united 
nations say farewell to president reagan and greet george bush 
reagans successor and meet with cuban leader fidel castro and 
british prime minister margaret thatcher 
but he has been extraordinarily active this fall in pressing for 
improved relations particularly with western europe since 
september he has received leaders from west germany austria 
italy romania and france has visited india and on saturday 
discussed with chinas foreign minister the need for a 
sovietchinese summit within the next six months 
hes very much a realist one source said and as a 
realist he knows he must dispel the enemy image and develop a 
network of relationships with other countries before he can permit 
massive reductions in military spending and a reallocation of 
resources

the 11member leadership of the 
leftist greens party resigned saturday after a noconfidence vote 
from members seeking a more moderate course 
the governing council for the environmentalist party had been 
dominated by a radical faction that sees little worth in trying to 
influence government actions by working within the west german 
parliament 
only 44 of the 519 bundestag seats are held by members of the 
greens party 
about 400 greens delegates gathered during the weekend in 
karlsruhe for a special party conference during which a 
noconfidence vote was proposed the council and their supporters 
had been blamed by other factions within the party for 
irregularities in the financing of a new party building in bonn 
the noconfidence declaration was approved by a 214 to 186 vote 
after which the council resigned 
ousted council member christian schmidt said the shakeup may 
cause the more radical faction to form their own political party 
parliament member and greens moderate otto schily said he viewed 
the departure of the farleft leadership as a chance for the 
moderates to bring the party closer to the political center 
the 39000member party had been moving farther left during the 
past year a trend that moderates feared could alienate more voters 
and jeopardize the greens continued participation in the bundestag 
only political parties garnering at least 5 percent of the vote in 
national elections are allowed to send representatives to the 
parliament 
greens candidates got 83 percent of the vote during the last 
federal elections in 1987 
the party that developed from a radical environmentalist movement 
in the 1970s formed a national organization in 1979 and first won 
election to the bundestag in 1983

southern african peace talks ended 
without an accord saturday when angola south africa and cuba failed 
to agree on verification of a cuban troop withdrawal from angola 
the usmediated talks were expected to produce an interim 
accord 
south african diplomats cited progress but some members of the 
us cuban and angolan delegations appeared angry those members 
who declined to be further identified questioned whether the south 
africans had any intention of negotiating an agreement 
a south african spokesman roland darroll said the delegations 
had to return home for further consultation with their governments 
on essential questions which have not been resolved 
the main issue remaining is verification of the withdrawal of 
50000 cuban troops from angola which is scheduled to occur over a 
27month period 
south african sources say they demanded representation on the 
force monitoring the withdrawal and have declined a us offer to 
observe and guarantee the pullout 
darroll said the failure to secure an agreement during these 
talks should not be considered a rupture because progress has been 
recorded we will be returning to brazzaville again with the 
other delegations 
although the south africans sought to minimize the significance 
of the failure to reach agreement as late as saturday afternoon 
their congolese hosts had been predicting an accord would be signed 
ten days ago president denis sassounguessos government announced a 
treaty would be signed dec 1 
failure to reach an accord threatens the latest deadline for 
beginning the independence process for southwest africa also known 
as namibia which borders south africa 
south africa has said it would like to begin this process which 
will be supervised by the united nations by jan 1 however 
pretoria has insisted the cuban troops be withdrawn from angola the 
territorys northern neighbor 
the cubans have helped angolas marxist government rebuff south 
african invasions the government also is battling the antimarxist 
guerrillas of jonas savimbi backed by south africa the united 
states and other nations 
the united states and several african nations have tried to 
persuade angola to negotiate with savimbi saying only 
reconciliation can bring peace to the former portuguese colony 
angola has consistently refused to negotiate with savimbi who has 
fought from his guerrilla strongholds since losing a struggle for 
power following independence from portugual in 1975 
in walvis bay south africa president pw botha told a 
community festival saturday that the south african port surrounded 
by the territory of southwest africa will never become part of a 
future independent namibia 
botha said walvis bay is the most important harbor on the 
southwest african coast between south africas naval headquarters at 
simonstown and the angolan capital of luanda he said anyone 
suggesting that it would not remain part of south africa was talking 
nonsense

an afghan guerrilla alliance held its 
first direct talks with soviet officials since soviet troops were 
sent to back the marxist afghan government in 1979 
the head of the guerrilla delegation said the talks signaled the 
failure of a unmediated accord to end the fighting 
the talks began in taif a saudi arabian resort 600 miles from 
riyadh the informal meeting is to be followed by formal 
negotiations beginning later saturday or sunday said sources close 
to the talks 
no details were immediately available about the meeting 
the unmediated geneva accord signed in april by the soviet 
union and pakistan called the soviets estimated 100000 troops 
backing the marxist afghan government to leave by feb 15 
the first half left by august according to plan but the soviets 
recently halted the pullout to protest continued operations by the 
guerrillas who have captured a number of cities 
the saturday meeting began after the arrival of yuli vorontsov a 
deputy foreign minister recently named ambassador to afghanistan 
vorontsov headed the soviet delegation 
burhanuddin rabbani leader of a loose alliance of seven afghan 
resistance groups based in peshawar pakistan is the head of the 
fivemember guerrilla delegation 
rabbani in a statement released saturday in pakistan said 
moscow asked for the talks he said his delegation planned to ask 
the soviets to withdraw the remaining red army troops from 
afghanistan immediately 
the direct talks will mean the failure of the geneva 
accord rabbani said the us and pakistanbacked guerrillas 
were not a part of the geneva agreement 
rabbani said the delegation will also ask moscow for payment of 
war reparations and the urgent removal of mines in the area 
under russian occupation in addition the guerrillas want the 
soviets to supply maps of mined areas now under rebel control 
members of individual guerrilla groups met with soviet officials 
in islamabad last month and in bonn west germany earlier this year 
to discuss exchanging prisoners of war this was the first direct 
meeting with the guerrilla alliance 
saudi arabia a prowestern kingdom was chosen as a venue by the 
afghan resistance groups because of the influence it wields in the 
islamic world due to its oil wealth and control over islams two 
holiest shrines 
an official saudi statement issued late saturday distributed by 
the official saudi press agency said that the meeting was arranged 
at the mutual desire of the two sides and the aim was to 
discuss issues pending between the two sides to reach a just 
settlement of the afghan problem 
saudi leaders have tied the establishment of relations with 
moscow to a total pullout of soviet troops from afghanistan a 
moslem state 
vladimir petrovsky also a soviet deputy foreign minister told a 
press briefing in moscow on friday that the meeting was arranged by 
the saudi government with the cooperation of the afghan government 
it is aimed at finding ways for an internal afghan 
settlement he said however he added that the meeting was not 
connected to the international conference on demilitarization 
moscow and afghan president najib seek to convene an 
international conference to demilitarize the country and set up a 
coalition government with the guerrillas who have rejected such a 
conference

a briefing saturday by the advance team for 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev turned into a display of 
glasnost when team members disagreed whether the majority of soviets 
oppose gorbachevs reforms 
however the soviets could offer no clue to gorbachevs schedule 
of activities this week 
the teams chief spokesman nikolai yefimov a senior ideologist 
of the communist party central committee insisted the team had no 
more information on gorbachevs visit beginning with his arrival 
tuesday than the reporters they addressed 
last week the soviet un mission released a tentative schedule 
for gorbachev but later withdrew it 
yefimov and five other officials even refused to speculate on 
published reports that gorbachev would meet billionaire real estate 
developer donald trump or visit wall street while in new york 
but mark zaharov director of the moscow theater said he would 
like to see the broadway play a chorus line to get some tips on 
how to put on a hit musical 
our critics have been telling us that we too seldom put forward 
any blockbusters i would like to know whether you have a musical on 
broadway that has taken over from a chorus line said zaharov 
he said gorbachev and his wife raisa love the theater but he 
doubted their schedule would leave time for them to attend any 
broadway shows 
the briefing epitomized gorbachevs program for glasnost or 
openness when the two officials disagreed on details of soviet 
reforms 
zaharov a writer and director of the lenin council of the moscow 
theater said gorbachevs reforms were not supported by a majority 
of soviets 
in my personal feeling very many people in our country dont 
understand the importance of the processes that are going on in mr 
gorbachevs initiative zaharov said i think he has more 
opponents than supporters 
i think in our country there is a lot of inertia still 
prevailing lack of initiative and we are reaping the harvest of 
some very difficult times in our history and in this regard i am 
somewhat pessimistic myself he said 
yefimov disagreed 
i dont share i repeat i dont entirely share the view of my 
friend mark zaharov when he said that gorbachev has more opponents 
than supporters yefimov said 
the forces of inertia are very great and these forces of 
inertia and these old habits are part of all of us maybe im too 
optimistic i dont know but i can say with an absolutely clear 
conscience that this reform machine is moving and is on its way

the head of the moslem cabinet in 
lebanons dual government said saturday that the christian decision 
to close the only crossing linking the divided capital was 
sabotage 
the closure of the museum crossing was ordered friday by 
christian army commander gen michel aoun to protest harassment by 
syrianbacked milities of soldiers moving from west beirut to the 
east side 
the move has caused food and fuel shortages in west beirut 
this is an irresponsible act of sabotage said acting prime 
minister salim hoss a sunni moslem aoun heads the threemember 
christian interim cabinet 
a military source said saturday the real reason behind aouns 
move was the failure of the central bank based in west beirut to 
pay the november salaries of army personnel stationed in east 
beirut officials at the central bank declined to comment 
the closure brought the daily truck supplies of flour and fuel 
from christian east beirut to the moslem sector to a standtill 
causing thousands of residents to crowd gas stations and bakeries to 
stockpile on the commodities 
it also was feared that the christian army command would order a 
blockade of drinking water water tanks which supply both sides of 
the capital are based in east beirut 
the development aggravates a political crisis that threatens to 
formalize the nations de facto partition into two sectarian states 
the crisis began when parliament failed to elect a successor to 
former president amin gemayel who minutes before his term expired 
on sept 22 appointed aoun to head the interim cabinet 
syrianbacked moslem leaders rejected aouns appointment and 
backed hoss 
aouns appointment the moslems charged violated an unwritten 
national covenant dating to lebanons independence from france in 
1943 under that pact the premiership is given to the sunni moslem 
sect the presidency to the maronite christians and the position of 
parliament speaker to a shiite moslem

hedda nussbaum a oncepretty woman whose face 
and psyche bear the scars of what she describes as domestic torture 
has told of a sorrowful scenario that ended in death for 6yearold 
lisa steinberg 
on monday ms nussbaum a former editor for random house will 
return for a third day as the key prosecution witness in the trial 
of her former companion disbarred lawyer joel steinberg who is 
charged with murdering the illegally adopted child they raised as 
their own 
her testimony broadcast live by three local television stations 
and recounted nationally has described an 11year relationship that 
deteriorated with beatings brainwashing food deprivation and other 
bizarre punishments for imagined transgressions 
a 1981 photograph shows a smiling vivacious brownhaired hedda 
nussbaum who bears no resemblance to the woman now testifying 
grayhaired with a boxers nose a cauliflower ear a deformed 
mouth an injured eye 
im hoping something positive will come out of it more 
support more treatment and more awareness for women and for 
children said janet segal director of clinical services at the 
four winds hospital in katonah where ms nussbaum has received 
psychiatric treatment since march 
its not something that can be treated with a pill or one or 
two therapy sessions it takes a lot of concerted effort 
in a slow deliberate voice punctuated by pain when she talks 
about lisa ms nussbaum 46 has told how she came to view 
steinberg as a godlike figure asking his permission to eat 
obeying his orders to sleep on the floor or sit in a tub of cold 
water 
jurors saw handwritten pages in which nussbaum vowed to care 
about steinbergs hair clothes work problems diet future teeth 
and other concerns in another paper she wrote 10 times that 
anger is destructive and that selfdefense is regressive 
steinberg convinced ms nussbaum that she had belonged to a 
sadomasochistic cult then encouraged her to imagine the details 
after convincing her she had amnesia she testified 
it was in this climate the prosecution alleges that an abused 
and neglected lisa was hurt on the night of nov 1 1987 hours 
later joel steinberg smoking cocaine admitted knocking the child 
down and said it was because she stared at him ms nussbaum 
testified lisa died four days later of a brain injury 
ms nussbaum was arrested with steinberg after the little girls 
death but charges against her were dropped and she agreed to 
testify against him 
the prosecution contends that ms nussbaum who lost her job when 
she frequently missed work because of injuries and then spent most 
of her time confined to the familys greenwich village apartment 
was herself too much of a victim to have helped the child 
i can liken it to being a prisoner of war ms segal said 
saturday 
the battered spouse syndrome ms segal said is a process of 
brainwashing where you end up not really knowing what you think 
what you believe whats right whats wrong gradually theres 
an erosion of spirit of will of judgment 
its victims often are those who tend to be a bit timid 
possibly fearful of the unknown she said 
testimony showed that ms nussbaum tried to run away six times 
once she changed her mind because she feared violent retaliation 
she said once a friends brother told her she was being disloyal 
to steinberg once she went to a connecticut social services 
agency where a staff member asked steinberg to come get her 
generally what you find is an alliance of sorts physical or 
emotional abuse which is then almost like a seesaw balanced by 
some occasional nurturing said ms segal for a great many 
women if they did leave where would they go especially with 
children in addition to lisa ms nussbaum and steinberg had 
another illegally adopoted child a boy who has since been returned 
to his natural mother 
ms segal said patient confidentiality precluded her discussing 
specifics of ms nussbaums case 
shes been very courageous and is handling herself beautifully 
thats my personal opinion said ms segal adding that she also 
had told that to ms nussbaum 
i think that now people may feel a little safer talking about 
some of this it might encourage women to seek help to try to get 
out of eroding situations in their lives and to know that theyre 
not alone

kremlin officials beefed up security at airports 
and power plants in the republics of azerbaijan and armenia on 
saturday and scrambled to aid 150000 refugees who have fled their 
homes in fear of ethnic violence soviet media reported 
the moscow leadership also ripped into the communist party and 
government leaders of the rival republics for failing to halt the 
wave of rioting that has killed at least 28 people 
soviet leaders ordered local officials in the republics to work 
together on a special commission to ease the tension and assigned 
several members of the ruling politburo to assist them 
instead of fighting those who instigate disorders spread all 
kinds of rumors and stir up national hatred there is only dispute 
about who is more guilty the official tass news agency said 
saturday in reporting on an emergency meeting called thursday by 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev with leaders of azerbaijan 
armenia and the disputed territory of nagornokarabakh 
the two republics cannot agree on even one action together 
tass said 
tanks and soviet soldiers moved into the two southern republics 
two weeks ago in attempt to stop the violence but tensions have not 
abated on friday official baku radio reported that troops halted a 
mob of 1500 that was attempting to attack armenian residents of the 
azerbaijani capital 
the tass report carried on the national evening news saturday 
flatly rejected any possibility of altering the borders of the 
republics in the currently volatile situation 
armenians have been demanding that nagornokarabakh a largely 
armenian section of azerbaijan be turned over to the armenian 
republic 
azerbaijanis and armenians must work out a joint solution in 
which there should be no winners or losers tass said the 
report also warned that tomorrow might be even more tragic if 
nothing is done 
the council of ministers ordered a 24hour guard on power 
plants oil and gas fields pipelines power lines and facilities 
for rail and air transport communications and water supplies in 
both republics tass reported baku is the center of the caspian sea 
oilfields 
such action was required because certain irresponsible elements 
are trying to put out of action vitally important industrial and 
transport facilities tass reported the council of ministers also 
ordered local authorities to being arresting strike organizers and 
anyone else wreaking havoc with the economy 
baku remained exceptionally tense as crowds numbering into the 
hundreds of thousands continued to mass on lenin square soldiers 
searched arriving demonstrators for weapons and explosives said 
baku radio quoting col gen tyagunov military commandant of the 
city 
the radio reports tried to crush rumors that large numbers of 
azerbaijanis have been slain or injured in the ethnic disputes with 
armenians in reality just 17 people had been treated by baku 
medical authorities in the past several days even though 78000 
azerbaijanis have swarmed back to their native republic from 
armenia the radio reported 
the azerbaijani council of ministers confirmed the figure of 
78000 refugees in azerbaijan the armenpress news agency in armenia 
said 70000 armenians had fled in the opposite direction 
the tass report on gorbachevs meeting with political leaders and 
citizens of the two republics flatly rejected any notion that the 
strife is solely due to the dispute over nagornokarabakh it 
admitted serious failures in economic political and social issues 
but added that the issue has become a coverup for corruption and a 
struggle for power 
the report did not name which politburo members would be assigned 
to the commission however the politburo members at thursdays 
meeting included prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov nikolai n 
slyunkov vladimir m chebrikov alexander n yakovlev and 
nonvoting members anatoly i lyukyanov and georgi p razumovsky

a sharp earthquake deep beneath city hall 
jarred southern california early saturday toppling bottles from 
store shelves knocking out power to thousands of homes and causing 
at least 24 minor injuries 
the 338 am quake registered 5 on the richter scale said hall 
daily a spokesman for the california institute of technology 
seismology laboratory several aftershocks were recorded the 
largest measuring 26 
no serious damage was reported 
the quake was felt at least 90 miles away in san diego the 
earth shook across 15000 square miles and seven counties for about 
15 seconds 
talk about your rude awakenings said patricia brillhart who 
was awakened at her home a quartermile from the rose bowl by her 
shaking bed and the sound of her china crashing to the floor the 
rose bowl is about two miles from city hall 
it was the strongest quake in the los angeles area since a 59 
temblor on oct 1 1987 and an aftershock two days later killed 
eight people injured 200 and caused 358 million in damage 
the 66yearold rose bowl home of the annual tournament of roses 
new years day college football classic appeared to be undamaged 
twentyfour people were treated for minor injuries at four 
hospitals most suffered cuts and bruises when they trippped and 
fell nursing supervisors said 
the most serious injury was a man who mistook the quake for an 
intruder and shot himself in the leg said shirley muldoon nursing 
supervisor at st josephs medical center in burbank 
an 18yearold man apparently panicked and fell through a window 
suffering minor abrasions said county uscmedical center 
spokeswoman norka manning 
it started out slow then bam for seven seconds said 
mitch cramer night manager at a grocery store where the quake 
broke jelly jars and juice and liquor bottles 
the beef jerky fell down the windows shook and the doors 
rattled said azad medi a clerk at a gas station and convenience 
store in el toro 
power outages were scattered throughout the area including 
pasadena downtown los angeles and parts of the san fernando valley 
the quake was felt in los angeles orange riverside san diego san 
bernardino kern and ventura counties 
about 100000 customers of the los angeles department of water 
and power were without electricity for up to seven minutes said 
spokesman ed freudenburg about 1000 customers in the van nuys area 
were without power for about 90 minutes 
the temblor was at first believed to have been centered about six 
miles beneath the rose bowl but additional readings later saturday 
revealed the quake was centered 10 miles beneath the pasadena city 
hall about two miles east of original estimates said daily at 
caltech 
the city hall was damaged in a stronger 1987 quake and now stands 
behind scaffolding but did not appear to be damaged further 
although authorities had not yet closely examined it 
a magnitude 5 is just beginning to get into the type of 
earthquake that one would expect damage at least with the 
construction practices we have here said caltech seismologist 
clarence allen 
pasadena officials said the quake broke a few residential gas 
lines and tripped numerous tripped burglar and auto alarms the 
quake shattered plate glass windows in some stores 
mark gofstein a newscaster for a radio station at the university 
of california at los angeles said he was at the station on the 
westwood campus when the temblor hit 
a lot of pranksters started calling up the station requesting 
the song shake rattle and roll gofstein said 
before the 1987 quakes in whittier the most destructive recent 
quake in metropolitan los angeles was the 1971 san fernando quake 
which measured 64 and caused 511 million in damage 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage in the local 
area 6 severe damage and a 7 reading is a major earthquake 
capable of widespread heavy damage an 8 is a great quake 
capable of tremendous damage 
the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred before the 
richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 on the richter 
scale

sen paul simon expects to have all his 
presidential campaign debts paid off by early january and he says 
hell probably sit out the 1992 race for the white house 
instead simon said in a radio interview taped friday that he is 
eager to start all over again on a campaign to retain his senate 
seat in 1990 
simon dill said he has no problems with the rev jesse 
jackson and does not expect a backlash from jackson supporters when 
he seeks reelection 
simons presidential bid effectively ended after the illinois 
primary in which he defeated fellow illinoisan jackson but he kept 
a hold on the delegates he won until the democratic national 
convention 
some jackson backers contend that simons refusal to release his 
delegates after dropping out of the race undermined jacksons broker 
status at the convention 
i dont think there will be much of a problem in 1990 simon 
said in the radio interview which is to be broadcast sunday on wbbm 
radio my voting record is clear on civil rights things that are 
important to minorities 
jackson has earned his spurs within the democratic party and 
should be viewed as one of the partys leaders simon said 
simon said his unsuccessful presidential bid cost about 11 
million and he expects to have all campaign debts paid off by next 
month 
he said it is extremely unlikely that he would run for 
president again in 1992 his immediate task is to start raising the 
6 million he expects to spend in the 1990 senate race simon said

the european economic community and the united 
states skirmished over farm subsidies on saturday as trade ministers 
of more than 100 nations began arriving for global freetrade talks 
the eec is under heavy pressure from the united states as well as 
major grainexporting nations such as argentina and host canada to 
reduce the protection it gives its farmers 
its very clear that many divergences still exist on 
agriculture i hope us agriculture secretary richard lyng is 
coming in like santa claus with a bag full of realistic proposals 
willy de clercq the eecs minister for finance and foreign trade 
said in a news conference 
however us negotiators stuck to a tough line no deal is 
better than a bad deal alan holmer a top us delegate said in 
a separate press conference 
trade ministers of 105 countries including 96 member nations of 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade began arriving saturday 
for the midterm review of freetrade talks under the auspices of the 
gatt 
us european japanese and canadian negotiators met in an 
informal session on saturday to review the prospects for the talks 
which officially begin monday 
holmer said the meeting crystallized the differences that 
exist between the parties apparently referring mainly to the 
dispute over farm subsidies 
michael samuels a us negotiator said cutting farm subsidies 
would save money for taxpayers and consumers the united states 
estimates that worldwide subsidies cost 200 billion a year 
de clercq said the 12nation eec or common market believes a 
compromise on agriculture is possible in montreal if the united 
states drops its demand for a commitment from all the participants 
on the total elimination of tradedistorting farm price supports 
he accused the united states of looking for an alibi not to act 
in the short term by insisting on a longterm solution 
de clercq said the eec is willing to adopt a freeze on 
agricultural subsidies in the coming two years and discuss their 
reduction though not total elimination 
but samuels in a later press conference said setting an 
objective of total elimination of subsidies is the best way to make 
progress he said europe should find ways to protect its rural areas 
that do not lead to overproduction of food 
de clercq said the eec would push ahead with efforts to reach 
agreement on removing barriers to the export of tropical products 
such as coffee bananas and citrus fruit from developing nations 
he rejected us demands to link the tropical products issue to 
progress in the agricultural negotations 
the current uruguay round of talks began in punta del este 
uruguay in 1986 and is scheduled to end in 1990 
it is the most ambitious of the eight rounds of talks that have 
been held since the gatt was formed after world war ii including 
for the first time such issues as trade in services and protection 
of intellectual property such as patents and copyrights 
the gatt is both an agreement and an organization which has a 
permanent headquarters in geneva 
the talks are taking place as usual largely behind closed 
doors they are theoretically scheduled to end on wednesday but are 
likely to last into thursday or possibly friday 
samuels said the representatives of the united states japan 
canada and eec agreed at their meeting saturday that an agreement 
should be completed wednesday night so it can be ratified by the 
trade ministers on thursday

the florida supreme court will hear 
arguments this week in a custody battle between a childs biological 
and adoptive parents in a case that could curtail privately arranged 
adoptions in the state 
the court is being asked to decide if a man who virtually ignored 
his pregnant girlfriend after she refused to have an abortion can 
retain the right to challenge her decision to put the baby up for 
adoption the man began the challenge shortly after the baby was 
born two years ago and he also later reconciled with and married 
the mother 
arguments were scheduled to be heard tuesday with a ruling 
expected in about a month 
certainly it would concern me if the court was to say the 
biological father could show up at any point and have the adoption 
overturned said greg coler state secretary of health and 
rehabilitative services it puts the chance of establishing 
permanency for the child at great risk 
paternal rights in adoptions have been in the legal spotlight 
recently in several states last week the us supreme court heard 
a california case in which a man sought visitation rights to his 
7yearold daughter given up for adoption 
in the florida case court documents use assumed names calling 
the adoptive parents bob and jane doe and the biological parents 
richard and mary roe 
mary gave upthe child up for adoption within 48 hours of his 
birth richard who initially had refused to get married and had 
urged an abortion then hired a lawyer acknowledged paternity and 
sought to halt the adoption 
richard and mary were reconciled and married when the baby was 2 
months old 
in june 1987 a judge ruled against roe saying he had 
effectively abandoned the child during marys pregnancy the 
adoptive parents provided an apartment paid her medical costs and 
gave her 300 a month for expenses 
a state appeals court reversed the ruling in march saying the 
fathers consent was necessary in a privately arranged adoption 
however the appeals court left the boy with his adoptive parents 
until the supreme court could review the case 
attorney michael carbo said a decision for roe could mean the end 
of privately arranged adoptions 
if the putative father could come in and essentially negate the 
entire adoption proceeding because of the fact he wasnt consulted 
or he didnt know he was the father at the time would you invest a 
significant amount of time and money in the expenses surrounding the 
birth he asked

an synthetic narcotic similar to heroin that 
caused at least 13 deaths was produced by a professional chemist in 
a basement laboratory at the home he shares with his elderly 
parents authorities said 
an informant led city state and federal agents to the home of 
thomas schaefers 48 in suburban aspinwall late thursday assistant 
us attorney bruce teitelbaum said friday 
schaefers jailed on a charge of drug manufacturing is the 
latest of 12 suspects arrested in connection with the drug 
3methylfentanyl also known as china white 
besides the 13 deaths confirmed to be caused by the drug it is 
suspected in seven additional deaths 
teitelbaum said the informant claimed schaefers made china white 
with ingredients obtained at his job in a calgon corp lab outside 
pittsburgh and from a pharmacist who wrote phony prescriptions 
teitelbaum did not identify the informant who he said is an 
addict who got the idea for making synthetic heroin from a 
television news report nearly two years ago about socalled designer 
drugs 
the informant took the idea to schaefers who began working on 
the compound in november 1987 and made a successful batch on his 
third attempt teitelbaum said in addition to that oneounce batch 
schaefers made a second larger batch that netted him and the 
informant 14000 in profits teitelbaum said 
schaefers has a bachelors degree in chemistry and has been a 
staff chemist at calgons industrial water treatment research center 
in robinson township since 1977 said company spokesman tom erdner 
calgon officials promised to cooperate with police 
six people suspected as leading distributors of the drug also 
were arrested thursday five others were charged earlier

an official of the chernobyl nuclear plant 
says he would like to see a joint ussoviet reactor built to help 
prevent future accidents 
i think that only by joint efforts can we create a new modern 
type of reactor which could exclude the negative impact on the 
environment and exclude the possibility of such accidents which 
happened at three mile island and chernobyl mikhail borisyuk 
deputy secretary of chernobyl said in an interview friday 
borisyuk is one of 10 soviets and 11 americans on the global 
environment commission of the usussr emerging leaders summit 
a weeklong gathering of more than 340 americans and soviets that 
began thursday 
the delegates spent much of saturday watching the armynavy 
football game at veterans stadium and visiting the liberty bell and 
independence hall 
ilona zheleznyako 30 a housing construction engineer from 
tinda siberia touched the historic bell which rang in july 1776 
to announce the adoption of the declaration of independence she 
said she felt a good feeling of freedom and liberty 
sergei chelnokov 34 said he was impressed with the longevity of 
the us constitution 
in our country there is a rethinking of some of the ideas of 
our revolution and we are now reconstructing a society which is 
only 70 years old he said so it is amazing that something that 
is three times as old is still working 
the summit is focused on private meetings of 16 commissions 
assigned areas of discussion such as the environment military 
affairs religion science business the media and the arts 
the global environment commission will look at such topics as 
global warming ozone depletion acid rain ocean waste economic 
development and international agreements 
the conference comes as the soviet union has begun reexamining 
conservation practices and giving citizens a greater voice in 
environmental protection 
the 1986 explosion and fire at chernobyl was the worlds worst 
nuclear accident it killed at least 33 people sent a radioactive 
cloud around the globe and made an area within a 40mile radius of 
the plant uninhabitable 
at pennsylvanias three mile island reactor equipment failures 
and human error led to a loss of coolant and partial core meltdown 
in 1979 
the main lesson is the imperfection of technology that is used 
at atomic power plants both in the united states and in the 
ussr and also imperfection of personnel training borisyuk 
said 
he said he believes nuclear energy remains the safest and 
leastpolluting form of energy if properly managed

church saturday criticized their bishops decision to sell to 
japanese investors the oceanfront land on which their parish has 
worshiped since the 1830s 
the 45 million deal which will result in the demolition of the 
copperroofed modernistic st augustine church in the heart of 
waikiki and the building of a new church nearby was announced

saturday after news reports of the sale the diocese hired a public 
relations firm to help field the calls 
an advertisement taken out in the major daily newspapers here

rome which would have the power to overturn ferrarios decision

parcel where the sacred hearts fathers have led services since a 
thatched missionary church was built in the 1830s members of the 
order and the congregation complained that the deal went through 
without their approval 
i thought they were going to take our feelings into 
consideration said adeline trask one of about 35 parish members

offers that were being made for the church property amid a land boom 
fueled by japanese investments

of our properties he said its a question of justice the 
haves serving the havenots of respecting the rights of people of 
the parish 
at 45 million the property is going for 900 a square foot 
compared with 400 a square foot in other recent sales of similar 
waikiki property 
the rev louis boeynaems a retired priest who served as st 
augustine church pastor from 1980 to 1983 said many priests are 
flabbergasted that he ferrario doesnt consider the history of the 
place 
newspapers here reported that company officials could not be 
reached for comment on what they intended to do with the property 
but there was speculation that a luxury hotel or condominiums would 
be built the property is across the street from waikiki beach 
whereas the new site the church would be given is several blocks 
from the beach

investigating eight suspicious deaths of elderly residents of a 
nursing home in this grand rapids suburb 
police said earlier that the investigation was limited to the 
deaths of marguerite chambers 60 and edith cook 98 whose bodies 
underwent autopsies after being exhumed last week 
but police chief walter sprenger said during a saturday news 
conference that chambers and cook were among eight alpine manor 
nursing home residents whose deaths during the first six months of 
1987 were under investigation 
sprenger said police have not determined a motive he would not 
elaborate on potential suspects saying were trying to focus in 
on who are the specific suspects we have rumors we have names we 
have a list of names 
autopsies were not conducted at the time the patients died 
because the deaths were considered natural at the time 
but sprenger said detectives began investigating the deaths in 
early october using a list of eight potential victims provided 
by a source he would not identify 
weve continued on because we are convinced that something has 
occurred sprenger said adding that police were investigating 
reports that some victims had been suffocated 
results of an autopsy on chambers were inconclusive and results 
of a saturday autopsy on cook were not immediately available 
sprenger said at least one other body might have to be exhumed he 
said three of the eight were cremated 
a woman answering the telephone at the nursing home saturday 
evening referred all questions to a public relations firm there was 
no answer there

four soviet gunmen who seized a busload of 
children in southern russia and then traded them for a 33 million 
ransom and a plane to israel were sent home saturday with the 
airplane crew they held hostage 
the four hijackers left in two planes with the eightmember 
aeroflot crew that brought them to israel and a 19member soviet 
delegation that arrived saturday to arrange the return officials 
said 
preparations for the departure were shown live on israel 
television with soldiers guarding the runway at bengurion airport 
near tel aviv 
the soviet unions tass news agency later reported that the 
planes landed at moscows sheremetyevo1 airport at about 6 pm 
est tass said the ransom money was returned to the soviet union 
the soviet union had requested extradition of the hijackers but 
ultimately israel deported them as illegal immigrants foreign 
ministry spokesman alon liel said this helped shorten the 
process 
as a condition for returning the hijackers israel received 
assurances the four men would not face the death penalty liel said 
israel radio reported that one of the hijackers requested political 
asylum in israel but liel said he could not confirm that 
originally there were believed to be five hijackers however it 
was determined that the wife of one of the hijackers was not part of 
the plot tass identified her as a hostage 
lt gen dan shomron israeli army chief of staff called the 
hijackers friday simple criminals with a lot of money who wanted 
to flee the soviet union 
the saga began thursday when the four gunmen seized a bus 
carrying 30 schoolchildren on an excursion in ordzhonikidze a city 
900 miles southeast of moscow in the russian republic after hours 
of negotiations the gunmen traded the children for an aeroflot 
jetliner out of the country a flight crew of eight and a ransom of 
33 million 
a teacher on the bus natalya efimova told staterun soviet 
television that one of the gunmen announced to the children i 
will release anyone who will burn his red scarf the teacher said 
the children who wear the scarves as part of their school uniforms 
stuffed them in their pockets to reduce the provocation 
the aeroflot jet landed in israel friday evening and the soviets 
surrendered soon afterward they were immediately taken to a prison 
near tel aviv the released crew spent the night in a tel aviv hotel 
the deportation saturday ended two days of unusual diplomatic 
contacts during which us officials played a role in getting the 
hijackers to israel and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
thanked the israelis for returning them 
liel said shevardnadze met with an israeli consular delegation in 
moscow on saturday to express the thanks and deep appreciation of 
the soviet government and soviet people regarding the noble way the 
government of israel has dealt with this barbaric act 
relations between the two nations have gradually been warming 
over the past few years moscow severed diplomatic ties in 1967 
after israel captured land from its arab allies during the middle 
east war 
israel television quoted foreign minister shimon peres as saying 
he hoped israels handling of the incident would lead to greater 
understanding between his country and the soviet union 
early in the drama the united states acted as an intermediary to 
help the two nations compensate for the lack of formal diplomatic 
ties defense ministry spokesman eitan haber said 
two of the soviets were sent back on the ilyushin76 that brought 
them to israel the other three were returned in a tupolev airliner 
that brought the soviet delegation to tel aviv on saturday 
soviet officials also were given the ransom money and the weapons 
carried by the hostages after signing a receipt for them israel 
television reported 
army radio said the five were taken blindfolded from abu kabir 
jail in tel aviv to bengurion about two hours before their 
departure 
in moscow vitaly a ponomarev deputy kgb chief identified the 
ringleader of the group as 38yearold pavel l yakshiants 
ponomarev said the man was a druguser who first asked to go to 
pakistan

an israeli linked to the irancontra affair who 
died in a plane crash last week said in june that a secret 
usisraeli agreement authorized counterterrorist operations he 
supervised with former white house aide oliver north the washington 
post said in its sunday editions 
amiram nir the former israeli official who died in a crash in 
mexico on wednesday told the post last summer that the agreement 
authorized stillsecret operations that he and north supervised in 
198586 the newspaper said 
the post said american and israeli sources confirmed the 
existence of the israeliamerican agreement referred to as terms 
of reference or accords by some knowledgeable sources the 
paper said the agreement never was disclosed to congress 
nir who served as an adviser on counterterrorism to two israeli 
prime ministers maintained that the secret usisraeli covert 
operations were authorized by an agreement signed by president 
reagan and thenisraeli prime minister shimon peres said the post 
other sources said the agreement was signed at a lower level in the 
two governments the newspaper said 
although few details of these operations have been disclosed the 
paper said nir said the israeli government has detailed records of 
all of them 
the post said one operation conducted under the agreement was the 
organizing of an armed force of lebanese druze in beirut in may 
1986 at a time when the white house was considering the use of 
force to try to free american hostages in lebanon 
as described by nir the agreement led to a series of covert 
actions that had common tactical elements according to the post 
the secret transactions that led to the diversion of usiran arms 
sales profits to the contra rebels in nicaragua may have fit a 
pattern established in those undertakings the newspaper said 
nir was interviewed by post reporter bob woodward on june 25 and 
june 26 in london with an agreement that none of the information 
would be attributed to him without further discussions the 
newspaper said 
nir told the post in october that he still was not ready to go 
public with the information the newspaper said it said post 
editors concluded that nirs death removed the reasons for the 
agreement to withhold attribution of the information he had provided 
roman popadiuk a white house spokesman declined comment on the 
story 
officials at the israeli embassy were unavailable for comment 
late saturday but embassy spokesman yossi gal told the post i 
wont go into this agreement israel and the united states have 
lots of agreements everything he nir did was being done by 
the government of israel 
nir told the post that israel had assembled extensive records 
based in part on his detailed notes and papers that were not turned 
over the united states the records provide pointbypoint 
documentation of all contacts discussions and undertakings with 
us officials including north nir said 
nir said he also provided full written reports to his superiors 
and gave oral briefings to peres the israeli prime minister who 
hired him and later to peres successor yitzhak shamir 
north who is under indictment in the irancontra case suggested 
during testimony heard by us congressional investigators that the 
plan to divert money to the contras was nirs idea israel denied 
that 
the agreement is among the classified documents that norths 
lawyers are seeking to introduce into evidence at the former white 
house aides trial the post said citing an unidentified source it 
said norths lawyer brendan v sullivan declined to comment 
nir was an important liaison in the secret arms deals according 
to testimony before the congressional investigators his activities 
included trips to iran and western europe 
he was sought for questioning by independent counsel lawrence e 
walsh but israel insisted that he be granted immunity from

president reagan has told the soviet union a 
new treaty to sharply reduce longrange nuclear weapons will be 
completed only if a siberian radar station is leveled 
in a report to congress on friday the president said soviet 
proposals to convert the disputed krasnoyarsk installation into an 
international space research facility would not correct its 
violation of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
we cannot conclude new strategic arms control agreement while 
this violation remains uncorrected reagan said 
the proposed new treaty would reduce us and soviet arsenals of 
longrange nuclear bombers missiles and submarines by 30 percent to 
50 percent negotiations in geneva were adjourned last month with 
the two sides agreeing to resume them in early 1989 
the report also accused the soviets of violating the 1972 abm 
treaty by moving radar and electronics equipment to gomel about 350 
miles southeast of moscow and reagan said the soviets violated the 
biological and toxic weapons convention of 1972 by maintaining an 
active offensive biological warfare program and capability 
other probable violations of test ban and chemical weapons 
agreements were alleged in the report an unclassified version of 
which was made public by the white house 
reagan informed congress he had reserved the right to take 
appropriate and proportionate responses to krasnoyarsk which 
the report said violates the abm treatys ban on trying to set up a 
nationwide antimissile defense 
but he stopped short of declaring krasnoyarsk a material 
breach of the treaty such a declaration would be a first step 
toward possible us abrogation of the treaty considered a landmark 
in nuclear arms control 
some of reagans advisers had recommended he take that step 
reagan did not tell congress in the classified report what 
measures the united states may take in response to krasnoyarsk in 
the past however us officials said retaining two or three 
nuclear trident submarines that were due to be dismantled was a 
possible option 
however the president cautioned that in order to broaden the 
basis for cooperation between our two countries the soviets must 
correct their violations and noncompliance activities with respect 
to the abm treaty and other arms control agreements 
on the other hand reagan said the soviets had resolved to our 
satisfaction us questions about their compliance with the treaty 
to abolish intermediaterange ballistic missiles that agreement was 
signed a year ago 
these included transporting missile parts to and from repair 
shops and moving missiles outside designated zones a us official 
who demanded anonymity told reporters at the state department 
lt gen colin d powell the presidents national security 
adviser said reagan was not expected to make a major issue of 
us complaints of soviet treaty violations in his meeting next 
wednesday with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev

the final word on fruitcake is out 
in time for christmas after a fiveyear battle that reached the 
highest echelon of german justice 
in a decision handed down friday by the supreme court the 
distinction of dresden fruitcake was determined to be its 
content not the location of the ovens that produce it 
the case stemmed from a bakerys complaint that a competitor was 
misleading customers by calling its product dresden fruitcake 
dresden is a city in east germany famous for producing the 
popular fruit and nut cake 
a lower court ruled the dresden name was a geographic designation 
and therefore misused when applied to baked goods produced elsewhere 
the high court overturned that decision saying the label had 
been used for years by bakers outside the dresden area and that west 
germans knew the cake was not produced in dresden

federal inspectors say they were impressed with 
the pilots at continental airlines and found no serious flaws with 
the management 
the federal aviation administration reported friday on the 
continental inspection conducted in october which did find some 
shortcomings in recordkeeping and listed 142 specific items in 
which there were technical violations of federal regulations 
among the concerns raised by the faa inspection team were that 
continental pilots on numerous occasions did not get enough rest 
between flights that records were incomplete and that manuals often 
were not up to date 
the inspection by a special team of investigators was similar to 
those regularly scheduled at all major air carriers and not prompted 
by any specific incident or concern 
many of the 142 violations cited in the report were not 
considered to be major 
for example a flight attendant was found with no flashlight 
fasten seat belt signs were found missing on the back of some 
aircraft seats and an inspector observed two pilots eating their 
meals at the same time while at cruising altitude all technical 
violations of regulations 
among other items cited in the report were pilots who failed to 
record maintenance discrepancies in a log after items were fixed a 
pilot not making proper altitude callouts during a landing and a 
crew failing to use an antiice mechanism while descending in 
possible icing conditions 
but the team of faa inspectors said that overall team members 
were very impressed with the professionalism displayed by 
continental cockpit and cabin crews while conducting en route 
inspections cockpit resource management was evident on all 
flights 
the faa report said the inspectors conducted 358 en route 
inspections at continental beginning last oct 13 
the faa said continentals management is adequate for the scope 
of the operation but that at times there are problems with the 
flow of information from upper and middle management to firstline 
supervisors and personnel 
flight and training manuals have not been brought up to date 
because of the introduction of a wide array of aircraft to the 
airline as it expanded and absorbed other air carriers the faa 
said some manuals were not accurate in the location of some 
emergency equipment such as fire extinguishers on certain aircraft 
the report said 
the inspection team said that continentals training program is 
in compliance with regulations but it said training records did 
not always clearly reflect in summary sheets when a pilots 
performance was unsatisfactory 
in addition inspectors were not able to adequately determine 
whether continental pilots are in full compliance with flight and 
duty regulations because of poor recordkeeping 
on numerous occasions continental airlines flight crews 
received less than the amount of reduced rest required by 
continentals operations manual pilot scheduling policy said the 
report

prince juergen von anhalt qualifies as a 
jetset artist in a literal sense 
he creates his artwork by standing behind jet engines throwing 
buckets of paint into the air and having the highvelocity 
propellant of the engines splatter the colors against his canvas 
the paintings are of course abstract von anhalt said friday 
their creation also is a little risky because he has to stand in 
the way of the jets force 
on thursday the platform he stood on at the new orleans 
lakefront airport warming up for his performance today upended 
moments after he stepped out of the jets 80 mph blast 
should debris go through the jet engines it could penetrate me 
like a bullet von anhalt said and then the fumes can be 
intoxicating 
the german artist known as his highness juergen prince von 
anhalt duke of saxony count of asconia and duke of westphalia 
came to new orleans at the invitation of grocery store magnate john 
schwegmann and his wife melinda 
using a schwegmannowned airplane von anhalt plans to perform 
his technoart today to create a work that will be raffled off for a 
university of new orleans fine arts scholarship fund 
von anhalt will work on an 8by8foot canvas with about 10 
gallons of paint 
most of his fans say the paintings remind them of volcanoes the 
creation of light or something else explosive said von anhalt men 
generally like his work better than women 
im looking for a way to unite different elements he said 
now im uniting art with technology and i love what comes out i 
never name my pieces i number them

the professional strong man who last year pulled a 91ton 
concorde 40 feet got the airbus wheels turning on his second try 
he pulled the jet 24 seconds to promote a christmas charity the 
distance was not measured 
gauder who is 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 240 pounds has 
also pulled a 40ton tractortrailer and halted two moving 
powerboats he won entry in the guinness book of world records in 
1985 for preventing two piper cherokee light aircraft pulling in 
opposite directions from taking off 
his wife who watched fridays pull said on our wedding day he

eighttapered candelabrum the menorah with an additional one lit 
on successive days until all eight of them burn 
the observance recalls the cleansing and rededication of the 
ancient temple in jerusalem which the syrian oppressors had 
converted into a scene of pagan idols and prostitution 
legend has it that only enough oil was available to keep the 
rededicated temple lamps burning for one day but they miraculously 
burned for eight the holiday lasts through next sunday

the let it burn policy sharply 
criticized after fires ravaged yellowstone national park should 
stand with minor changes to improve communication federal officials 
said friday 
teams of forest experts who reviewed four of the major fires that 
covered about half of yellowstones 22 million acres last summer 
also concluded that management decisions were sound for the most 
part said jack neckels deputy director of the rocky mountain 
region of the national park service 
the findings of the teams which looked at the fires from the 
preseason indicators through containment were released friday 
during a news conference at the national park service headquarters 
the teams found that no wholesale changes in the fire policy 
are required said gary gargill regional forester of the us 
forest service 
they found that the policy and the implemented plans need to be 
strengthened for some specific acceptable limits on such things as 
weather and the effects of drought he said 
the let it burn policy which has been adopted by both the 
forest service and nps allows natural fires to burn out by 
themselves unless they threaten property or humans 
it drew wide criticism during the fires at yellowstone by many 
who believed the blazes should have been fought more aggressively 
the review team reports will be forwarded to a policymaking team 
formed by the secretaries of interior and agriculture 
that panel is scheduled to give recommendations on the let it 
burn policy to interior secretary donald hodel as of dec 15 at 
that point another review process including public comment will 
be conducted 
among the weaknesses identified by the reviews was a lack of 
uniform definitions for terms and a need for improved coordination 
of fire management directions among the various forests and parks 
with similar boundaries 
neckels said the latter problem was identified a year ago as a 
priority for improving but was not resolved before the summer 
where you have boundaries like that clearly you cant have 
that much of a difference neckels said you have to have better 
coordination we knew that but we didnt get a chance to fix it 
prior to last season 
another problem to be addressed is establishing specific limits 
on factors such as weather the number of fires to allow within a 
park the effects of droughts he said 
what acreage point should we begin to say whoa these are 
the things that we have to consider he said 
during briefings wednesday and thursday review team members said 
that for the most part the actions were sound the decisions were 
sound neckels said 
certainly there were mistakes that were made there were things 
that we would do differently but all in all certainly i feel good 
about what our professional staff and the staff of other agencies 
did he said 
more than 249 fires were identified in the park last summer the 
worst on record in the northern rockies since 1910 
the firefighters concentrated on 13 blazes that were identified 
as the most destructive including one that threatened old faithful 
and another that forced the evuatation of the communities of 
silvergate and cooke city in montana 
gargill said 201 fires were suppresssed at 10 acres or less for 
an 80 percent suppression rate 
the two agencies plan to begin working on the problem areas with 
a goal of resolving them by april he said 
setting a fire management policy is sort of like building a 
church cargill said you dont size a church for an easter 
sunday crowd and this was an easter sunday fire

an attorney for eastern airlines argued in 
federal court that the unions at eastern want to stop it dead in 
its tracks by blocking the sale of its shuttle operation while 
the unions argued the company wants to intimidate the unions 
both sides began presenting their cases friday before us 
district judge barrington parker in the first of six days of 
hearings on the proposed sale of easterns northeast shuttle system 
to real estate mogul donald trump 
eastern and trump announced in midoctober a 365 million 
agreement allowing trump to buy the shuttle which provides hourly 
flights between new york and washington and new york and boston and 
to change the name to the trump shuttle 
but three unions representing pilots mechanics and flight 
attendants at eastern filed suit asking that the sale be blocked on 
grounds it violates labor laws 
during opening arguments friday airline attorney john gallagher 
said the unions want eastern stopped dead in its tracks in its 
attempt to make the airline profitable by reducing its size 
no employees are being forced out of eastern airlines he 
declared all shuttle employees can elect to remain at eastern 
airlines 
but lawyers for the three unions countered that easterns sale of 
the shuttle which has been easterns only profitable operation is 
part of an overall scheme by parent texas air corp to dismember the 
airline 
this is in fact a liquidation declared joe guerrieri a 
lawyer for the machinists union without the shuttle there is no 
way this airline can make it back to profitability 
james lindsey an attorney representing easterns pilots said 
the unions intend to show that the sale of the shuttle violates 
federal laws governing collective bargaining in the airline industry 
because it is aimed at putting pressure on the unions 
eastern and the machinists union are in the midst of bargaining 
for a new contract 
the sale of the shuttle is being used as shock treatment 
said lindsey 
but gallagher said the decision to sell the shuttle is not unlike 
easterns other recent decisions aimed at reducing the airlines 
size in september eastern curtailed its flights by 12 percent and 
eliminated 4000 jobs 
the airline currently employs about 30000 people including about 
700 who work in the shuttle operation trump has said he would like 
to have the current eastern employees on the shuttle remain at their 
jobs

the charismatic leader of 
argentinas latest military insurrection army col mohamed ali 
seineldin once rejected a medal for his service in the falkland 
islands war because his troops were defeated 
friends and colleagues interviewed friday described seineldin 
who was trained in part at the us military academy at west point 
as a widely respected officer known for ultranationalist political 
views 
the 54yearold officer led at least 400 backers who holed up in 
an army base outside the capital friday and battled government 
troops 
seineldin was born a moslem of syrianlebanese parents but 
converted to roman catholicism a superior once described him as 
holding the fanaticism of a convert in all his endeavors 
despite a distinguished military career seineldin was passed 
over for promotion to brigadier general last year and faced the 
prospect of eventual forced retirement 
he said friday he was not seeking to overthrow argentinas 
constitutional government but to restore military honor to the 
army 
seineldin said he also wanted a review of trials that punish 
the just and promote the guilty it was an apparent reference to 
trials of military officers accused of human rights violations 
during efforts by military governments in the 1970s to put down 
leftist subversion 
seineldin has denied involvement in the disappearance of about 
9000 argentines during the antileftist campaign 
after spending the last four years in panama first as argentine 
military attache and then as an instructor to the panamanian 
national guard seineldin was believed to have returned to argentina 
on thursday via neighboring uruguay to lead the revolt 
he was eager to come home his wife marta alice labiau told the 
private news agency dyn in a telephone interview from panama 
because it was beginning to look like he had been sent into 
exile 
seineldin was born nov 12 1934 in the town of concepcion del 
uruguay 140 miles north of buenos aires his father was a 
businessman and citrus grower 
a graduate of the argentine military academy he rose rapidly in 
rank specializing in infantry commando tactics 
he was assigned to lead commandos on the argentinachile border 
in 1978 when the two neighbors nearly went to war in a dispute over 
three tiny islands 
promoted to colonel seineldin led a commando unit that 
participated in the occupation of the britishheld falkland islands 
on april 2 1982 the argentines who call the islands the malvinas 
were defeated by a british task force 74 days later 
when seineldin was called to testify in human rights abuses 
trials in 1984 troops formerly under his command gathered outside 
the court to cheer him and shouted well go back to the 
malvinas

a hearing on the crash of delta flight 1141 
closed friday with federal aviation administration officials asked 
why their agency took weeks to distribute a safety bulletin for 
takeoff warning systems 
the delta 727 crashed on takeoff aug 31 at dallasfort worth 
international airport claiming 14 lives much of the probe has 
turned on whether the planes flaps were properly set for takeoff 
and whether a flap alarm system worked 
faa flight standards officer ben tollision was asked why his 
office had taken weeks to distribute to delta officials a bulletin 
telling them to immediately service their takeoff warning systems on 
boeing 727s and 737s 
the warning was prompted by the crash of northwest airlines 
flight 255 in romulus mich in 1987 
lane chandler principal operations inspector for the faas 
southern region that oversees delta airlines told the public 
hearing thursday his office had received the bulletin on aug 30 
or so delta flight 1141 crashed aug 31 claiming 14 lives 
the hearing concluded friday night after about 33 hours of 
testimony in which ntsb investigators interviewed experts in an 
effort to gather infromation that might find a cause of the crash 
board member jim burnett said the ntsb will continue the 
investigation although the hearing has concluded the federal agency 
continue accepting any new evidence until it drafts a final report 
on the crash in about six months 
chandler sent a letter to delta vice president harry alger dated 
sept 15 1988 notifying him of aircarrier operations bulletin 
no 8884 takeoff warning systems checks 
the accident in dallas has focused the nation on the takeoff 
warning system therefore we are requesting a little more than your 
usual prompt reply said chandler in his letter to alger 
chandler said in response to questions that sometimes it does 
take a while to distribute information to working levels to my 
level and explained he didnt specifically know how the june 17 
letter was routed 
chandler said the bulletin would have been relayed through 
several offices and reviewed by several individuals im not sure 
we call it a dead letter chandler said 
paul mccarthy of the airline pilots association said his group 
was investigating whether the delay in spreading notice of the 
inspections was normal or unusual 
mccarthy also noted that the issue may only be on the periphery 
of the public hearing the testing is irrelevant to this 
investigation only if it was a noflap situation mccarthy said 
we continue to dispute this assertion 
alpa has steadfastly maintained during the federal inquiry that 
the threeman delta crew who testified earlier were the victims of 
a splitflap configuation in which the planes outer flaps are 
extended or in place for a takeoff while the inner flaps were not 
a boeing aerodynamics engineer testified earlier that he believes 
delta flight 1141 given its recorded speed could have achieved 
flight even with no flaps

step into the mysterious windowless 
blue cube where 2000 engineers and scientists working furiously 
with old slow computers will soon have a new task tracking and 
controlling the 500 million spy satellite to be deployed by 
atlantis 
giant screens rows of terminals and bulky machines fill a 
warehousesize room in the militarys ultrasecret satellite 
tracking center receiving millions of bits of coded information 
each second on the location and operation of hundreds of us nato 
and foreign satellites 
the cube can order one of the more than 50 us military 
satellites to snap photos of suspected troop movements and drop off 
the film in a parachute package to an air force plane for a midair 
pickup it can adjust a satellites orbit solar energy panels 
cameras or other gear 
special attention is focused now on the new bird to be placed 
in orbit saturday by the shuttle a radar satellite codenamed 
lacrosse that is designed to spy on the soviet union and guide the 
stealth bomber 
the cube officially called the consolidated space test center 
is run by the air force in the heart of silicon valley next door 
are the nasa ames research center and lockheed missiles amp space co 
inc 
neither journalists nor others without top security clearance are 
allowed past the high fences and armed guards surrounding the pale 
blue building however interviews with air force and nasa officials 
with access to the cube all of whom asked not to be identified 
reveal a beehive of activity as a crack team of physicists 
electrical and mechanical engineers and computer scientists cope 
with a crush of signals to and from satellites 
the adrenalin flows you work 18 hours a day but you dont 
feel tired at all said one veteran of several satellite launches 
you suffer battle fatigue when its over but during the mission 
people get really hyped this is their time and theyre going to 
make it work when you run into obstacles because the system is 
clumsy just sheer energy makes it happen 
the cube has been in operation since 1959 virtually from the 
start of the space program despite the expenditure of several 
hundred million dollars to upgrade the computer and data 
distribution system over the past six years most of the computers 
in the cube are two or three generations old 
they are reliable workhorses built by international business 
machines corp and others in the 1970s and early 1980s but are much 
slower less efficient and more expensive to run than newer models 
at many companies in silicon valley 
instead of state of the art the cubes tubes and software 
programs remain antiquated one systems expert said because of 
government procurement policies 
nasa and the military are stuck in this catch22 the systems 
expert said its hard to sell missions and get money so people 
have to design minimal systems that use equipment from past 
missions and they end up putting systems in place that are terribly 
engineered 
he added though that very exceptional people at nasa and the 
military make the system work despite the system 
until a few years ago the cube was the nations only control 
center for military satellites a place so secret that officials 
used to deny even its existence 
located within bazooka range of two highways and close to three 
earthquake faults the cubes vulnerability led to a 35 billion 
overhaul to bring it up to date and build a command center with 
similar capabilities at falcon air force station in colorado 
springs colo 
those two centers are linked to eight nasa tracking sites around 
the world including guam spain and australia as well as other air 
force stations and a main ground station at white sands nm 
the tracking and data relay satellite system or tdrss is used 
to keep watch over all satellites friendly and unfriendly and any 
other space junk or debris from defunct satellites that could 
get in their way 
tdrss west a satellite in orbit 22000 miles over the western 
united states was the main tracker in space until september when 
the shuttle discovery placed tdrss east in geosynchronous orbit 
22000 miles over the atlantic 
for the launch of the new spy satellite the military and 
civilian teams in the cube and in colorado springs will take over 
control of the satellite from nasa once they get the word the bird 
is in orbit 
because of secrecy requirements nearly all the information from 
the tdrss satellites and the spy satellite is fully encrypted 
the ground station at white sands a huge computer complex that 
is perhaps the most modern communications facility in the world 
receives the information on two bands cband at 56000 bits per 
second and kuband at 300 million bits per second the system can 
run several channels of each band simultaneously taking in a total 
of more than a billion bits of information per second 
the signals are then broken up into multiple channels at lower 
rates easier to handle rebroadcast back up to military satellites 
and down again to the cube and colorado springs where they are 
monitored by the air force round the clock 
the first job after the shuttle drops off the spy satellite is to 
order the firing of positioning rockets to stabilize the satellite 
in orbit 
the exact position and type of orbit are secret although some 
experts call such secrecy a silly game since soviet tracking 
stations can tell where all us satellites are anyway

people who stumbled gasping and choking out 
of a deadly cloud of gas that leaked from the union carbide 
pesticide plant four years ago are still dying 
the official death toll from the worlds worst industrial 
disaster has reached 3329 about 20000 survivors still suffer from 
the effects of the dec 3 1984 gas leak and officials say at 
least one of them dies every day 
i have spent more time in hospitals than at home in the last 
four years said 15yearold sunil kumar who lost his parents and 
five brothers and sisters to the gas 
he and his younger brother and sister live on the 4730 they 
received from the government in compensation for the deaths of the 
rest of their family 
other gas sufferers have been less fortunate a 60yearold woman 
who identifies herself only as hakiman said she has been unable to 
get financial assistance because she could not provide an address 
she said she survives by selling empty medicine bottles she finds 
on a trash dump near jawaharlal nehru hospital at night she sleeps 
on the hospital grounds 
the government tells me that if i had a home i would have 
gotten some money as assistance she said but i need money to 
build a home 
sunil hakiman and other gas victims complain of shortness of 
breath and eye problems 
the worst effect has been on the eyes and lungs although there 
are numerous cases of total physical impairment said a bhopal 
doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the government has issued strict instructions to doctors and 
officials to make none of their findings public while indias 3 
billion damage suit against union carbide is pending 
the suit filed in 1986 has bogged down in the courts as is 
common in indian legal cases no quick end is in sight although the 
government tried to step up the pressure a year ago by filing murder 
charges against former union carbide president warren anderson and 
other company officials 
anderson and the others have not responded to summonses 
a year ago the government of madhya pradesh the state that 
includes bhopal put the gas leak death toll at 2850 it has 
recorded an additional 479 deaths in the last 12 months 
we are registering more than one death per day because of the 
effects of the gas said gas relief commissioner s sathyam whose 
department records complaints and helps gas victims 
most of the victims lived in the shantytowns that popped up 
outside bhopal after union carbide and other industries moved to the 
central indian city 
an estimated 250000 people onefourth of bhopals population 
inhabit the shantytowns and nearby slums that were in the path of 
the toxic cloud that formed when liquid methyl isocyanate leaked 
from a storage tank and turned into gas the cloud hit the air at 1 
am while most people were asleep 
after the magnitude of the disaster became known volunteer 
groups sprang up with the avowed aim of helping the victims 
one of these groups the poisonous gas episode struggle front 
won court acceptance to become a third party in indias suit against 
usbased union carbide and its indian subsidiary 
nobody is serious about the case said vibhuti jha the 
fronts lawyer it is essential that the victims get compensation 
at the earliest we just cannot allow the case to go on 
however most of the volunteer groups and opposition political 
parties do not want an outofcourt settlement 
we want multinational companies which thrive on business in 
third world countries to be taught a lesson and forced to adhere to 
safety requirements said balkrishna gupta a leader of the 
communist party of india 
union carbide based in danbury conn says the gas leak 
resulted from sabotage by a disgruntled employee at the plant run by 
the indian subsidiary the indian government maintains the leak was 
a result of negligence 
so far the most tangible relief for gas sufferers has been free 
medical care and government payments of 675 to next of kin for each 
person who died soon after the disaster 
many survivors say they are waiting for money from union carbide 
but some like sunil kumar say financial compensation is not so 
important 
we want to see union carbide punished for what it has done to 
our lives the teenager said

atlantis twin booster rockets were 
heading back to land by way of sea today after helping send the 
shuttle into space 
two ships towed the twin boosters toward port canaveral near the 
kennedy space center after they were recovered in rough seas 160 
miles out in the atlantic ocean 
they dropped with parachutes within eight miles of the recovery 
ships after friday mornings successful launch the second since the 
challenger disaster blamed on booster rockets 
everything appeared to be very nominal normal there appeared 
to be no external leakage or anything like that said jim thomas 
a motor technical assistant for the marshall space flight center who 
came to kennedy space center for the launch 
divers from the recovery ships took a quick look at the boosters 
tossed in rough seas with winds of 20 to 30 knots and saw no 
obvious damage said nasa spokesman george diller 
the divers removed the parachutes that slowed the boosters 
plummet then attached flotation devices and cables from the 
149foot boosters to the two recovery ships and began removing 
pockets of water nasa said 
the 200000pound steel casings were expected at port canaveral 
this afternoon after cleaning and other work here they will be 
returned to the utah plant of manufacturer morton thiokol inc for 
inspection and refitting 
the boosters have drawn close attention since their failure was 
blamed for the jan 28 1986 challenger explosion that killed all 
seven astronauts aboard the rogers commission that investigated the 
disaster said a booster oring that failed to seal in cold weather 
allowed flame to escape and ignited the main fuel tank 
nasa spent 800 million to make 145 changes in the booster design 
and for testing before the discovery launch sept 29 the massive 
rockets have 11 major components and are manufactured in four 
segments joined at the seams 
there are so many parts so many things that could go wrong 
said thomas but he added i was not nearly as apprehensive as 
he was during the discovery launch on that one there was a lot 
of apprehension i stood there and cried 
when fully loaded with 11 million pounds of propellant each 
booster weighs 13 million pounds and produces 33 million pounds of 
thrust that give the orbiter 80 percent of the power needed to lift 
it from the launch pad into orbit

president reagan has told the soviet union a 
new treaty to sharply reduce longrange nuclear weapons will be 
completed only if a siberian radar station is leveled 
in a report to congress on friday the president said soviet 
proposals to convert the disputed krasnoyarsk installation into an 
international space research facility would not correct its 
violation of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
we cannot conclude new strategic arms control agreement while 
this violation remains uncorrected reagan said 
the proposed new treaty would reduce us and soviet arsenals of 
longrange nuclear bombers missiles and submarines by 30 percent to 
50 percent negotiations in geneva were adjourned last month with 
the two sides agreeing to resume them in early 1989

a wall street buyout artists victory over a 
tough company executive in the struggle for rjr nabisco inc has 
reshaped the rules for debtfinanced jumbo takeovers showing 
dramatically that the fattest bid doesnt always win and flagrant 
greed can backfire 
moreover the hostility and controversy aroused by the conduct of 
chief executive f ross johnson in his dogged pursuit of rjr nabisco 
reflects heightened concerns about potential conflicts of interest 
when managers try to buy their companies 
some even say the fallout from this deal could dampen the 
enthusiasm for future managementled takeovers 
particularly troubling to many management strategists and to the 
companys directors as well were johnsons initial buylow 
approach his extravagant builtin rewards in the takeover plan and 
his evident disregard for the fate of most of the cigarette and food 
giants 120000 employees 
despite the johnson groups final 112ashare 252 billion 
offer rjr directors chose the 109ashare 245 billion 
alternative from kohlberg kravis roberts amp co the unchallenged 
leader in debtfinanced takeovers 
kohlbergs victory marked the biggest takeover in history and 
capped a tumultuous struggle for the nations 19th largest 
industrial company which transfixed the financial world incited 
congressional scrutiny and intensified concerns about the growing 
piles of debt burdening the american economy through the growing 
popularity of socalled leveraged buyouts 
although many lessons will be learned from this classic wall 
street brawl the ones that will most likely grab the attention of 
managers contemplating their own leveraged buyouts are johnsons 
mistakes 
i think one lesson they can draw is not to think they have a 
lock on the deal because they are the experienced managers and that 
they know the business said stewart veale finance division 
manager of the american management association a leading training 
and education group in new york 
another thing is this very well may be a signal that boards of 
directors believe managements have to pay closer attention to 
employees veale said 
postmortem accounts of the kohlbergjohnson struggle show rjr 
directors were impressed with the buyout firms commitment to 
minimize disruption to the company while johnson was determined to 
sell everything except the tobacco business to pay off the giant 
debt he would assume in the deal 
the board also appreciated kohlbergs sensitivty to rjr workers 
while johnsons offer barely mentioned them 
ordinarily boards in the past have taken the position that 
theyll accept the offer with the best return to shareholders 
veale said this is the first one of significant size where they 
didnt reach that determination 
to be sure at least some shareholders will be angry over what on 
its face value is a lower purchase price for their stock 
predictions already are flying that rjr directors will face numerous 
lawsuits over their disregard of the socalled business judgment 
rule by accepting the cheaper of two offers 
but some management and takeover experts say that anger is 
misguided since johnsons group started with a bid of 75 per 
share where they ask was johnsons obligation to maximize value 
to the shareholders when he offered that price 
i think the real villain in this whole process was mr 
johnson said yakov amihud a finance professor at new york 
universitys stern school of business who has just written a book 
about managementled takeovers 
he was the insider with the information kohlberg was the 
outsider without the information the knight that saved the 
stockholders was kohlberg because if they didnt get into it 
johnson would have walked away with it for 75 amihud said 
stockholders should be thankful to kohlberg 
steven p galante managing director of buyout publications 
which tracks trends in debtfinanced takeovers said he believed the 
rjr saga will help force management to recognize that a 
responsible board isnt going to let management get away with a low 
bid management shouldnt lowball it 
at the same time galante said the rjr takeover also provided 
some useful lessons to directors the objective bidding process that 
collapsed into a freeforall auction with extended deadlines and 
lastminute haggling was something that other boards will likely 
avoid he said 
i think the board in this case was trying to strike a strong 
degree of independence and show it was going to put the company up 
to the highest bidder galante said it turned out to be a 
fiasco it created all this bidding with a lot of uncertainty about 
whether the deals could be financed 
ultimately it may have been kohlbergs supremacy in financing 
other takeovers that led rjrs directors to believe going with the 
investment firms offer was more responsible 
if you were on a buyout team would you rather be on kohlbergs 
side or the other side said carla hayn a 
mergersandacquisitions professor at northwestern universitys 
kellogg business school kohlberg has a lot more familiarity and 
the financial resources to at least ride out any downturn where 
does johnson go for money 
even though johnson presumably knew his business better than an 
outsider ms hayn said its cheaper to buy a new ceo than to 
arrange financing if i had to cast my stakes even if kohlberg did 
offer the lower price id be going with someone that has gone 
through these kind of transactions before

in the closing weeks of 1988 wall 
streeters are still groping for the right prescription to 
reinvigorate a stock market that has languished all year 
while the markets maladies have resisted all remedies they have 
not turned out as severe as they threatened to become after the 
crash in october 1987 
after all barring a sudden sharp drop this month stock prices 
will close out this year as they did last year showing a net gain 
but that prospect stirred little elation among the brokers who 
gathered here this past week for the annual convention of their 
principal trade group the securities industry association 
trading volume in all markets remains down depressing a prime 
source of the streets revenues 
individual investors are still opting for the safe haven of 
certificates of deposit or money market funds and shunning stocks 
in addition the gains the market has managed to record have 
stemmed largely from takeover and buyout activity like the bidding 
war for rjr nabisco inc that has dominated recent financial 
headlines 
whatever shortterm benefits buyouts bring to brokers and their 
customers most analysts agree they have by no means solved the 
problem of restoring confidence in the market 
on the contrary they have raised fears of new shocks when the 
superstructure of debt created by the buyouts is sooner or later 
tested in a business downturn 
in the long term i think its unhealthy for the markets 
said joseph hardiman president of the national association of 
securities dealers which supervises the overthecounter market 
scandals over insider trading and other abuses also still cloud 
the outlook 
there is the matter of industry image or reputation or 
integrity call it what you will said edward obrien president 
of the securities industry association it is undeniable that it 
has been tarnished in the past few years 
while obrien argued that some criticisms of wall streets 
behavior have gone beyond what is justified he also acknowledged 
that they have stung 
in my view there is no magic potion that can be taken to 
produce a happy new world and national media campaigns are not the 
answer he said 
then too there is the question of whether investigations and 
reform measures since the 1987 market collapse have done enough to 
restore faith in the mechanism of the marketplace itself 
arthur levitt jr chairman of the american stock exchange 
thinks not he urged that the new administration and congress 
appoint a commission to do a longterm study of the markets 
more than 13 months after the fact he said i dont think 
anyone understands last october 
those who hold out hope for revived enthusiasm in the near future 
say their conviction lies in the very caution and pessimism that are 
so prevalent now 
they point to measures of investment advisory sentiment that have 
lately turned as gloomy as at any time since just before the start 
of the 198287 bull market 
and indeed adherents of this school of contrary opinion made 
their presence felt in the past weeks trading activity 
the dow jones industrial average of 30 industrials rose 1760 to 
209228 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 239 to 
15302 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
added 753 to 37391 and the amex market value index was up 408 to 
29527 
volume on the big board averaged 13254 million shares a day 
against 10786 million the previous week 
with so much money stockpiled in cds and money market 
investments a drop in interest rates might well give stocks a big 
lift said john bachmann a st louis brokerage executive who was 
chairman of the securities industry association the past two years 
in the crash he said the public was bruised and frightened 
but not broken i suspect we could have a surprisingly good year in 
1989
