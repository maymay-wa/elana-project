african nations on wednesday appealed to 
the security council to foil alleged attempts by south africa to rig 
the outcome of namibias preindependence elections in november 
the african nations told a special council meeting that south 
africa was trying to stop the southwest africa peoples 
organization known as swapo from taking power 
ghanas ambassador james v gbeho called on the security 
council to adopt a new resolution giving the united nations interim 
control over namibia rather than the south african 
administratorgeneral for namibia 
but south african un representative jeremy shearar said swapo 
was the real threat to namibian independence 
in response to criticism of the continued south african presence 
in namibia south africa said tuesday it was confining former 
members of a feared police unit to base for retraining 
but gbeho said it was not good enough to place former members of 
the koevoet police under un supervision he said the veterans who 
have been integrated into the south africanled namibian police 
should be fired 
ghanas ambassador also said the proposed election laws are 
unfair because they allow white south africans who worked or were 
born in namibia to register to vote there 
gbeho also objected to proposed namibian laws that disqualify 
those convicted of crimes including treason and sedition from 
voting or being candidates for the constituent assembly he said 
these provisions would bar many swapo leaders from running for 
assembly seats and prevent swapo activists from voting 
swapo has accused south africa of trying to manipulate novembers 
preindependence elections which it is expected to win 
shearar said it was a great pity the security council had 
been convened by the africans 
he said fewer than 2300 south africans with namibian citizenship 
had registered to vote so far up to 700000 people are expected to 
vote 
shearar said swapo poses the true threat to namibian 
independence he said that 1900 armed swapo guerrillas entered 
namibia from angola the day the unbacked peace plan went into 
effect on april 1 
hundreds of guerrillas and dozens of soldiers and police died in 
subsequent fighting between swapo and the south africanled security 
forces

it may be art but illinois tourism officials 
couldnt believe their eyes when an ad featuring an alberto vargas 
watercolor of a nude woman fondling her breasts beckoned europeans 
to visit chicago 
portrayed on the other side of the atlantic as home to seamy 
politics bluesy music and gangsters the city has long been viewed 
as a wideopen town but this time city and state officials 
concurred someone went too far 
we think there are a lot greater things that portray chicago 
better than a nude lady said avis lavelle spokeswoman for mayor 
richard m daley 
im sorry it happened gov james r thompson said but it 
wasnt our fault 
developed for the illinois department of commerce and community 
affairs by the milan italybased stz agency the ad featuring 
legacy nude no 1 was part of a 13week campaign running in the 
european editions of newsweek and time 
the campaign touts the citys worldclass architecture museums 
and business institutions the lake michigan shoreline its varied 
sports and vibrant nightlife 
the vargas painting was used in an ad promoting the citys 
magazine publishing community and was accompanied by copy inviting 
europeans to come to the city where life was created and 
playboy too and proclaiming a city once famous for its hogs 
gives birth to a bunny 
vargas famous varga girl paintings appeared in esquire 
which also got its start in chicago and later playboy from the 
1930s through the 1960s his works also are held by a number of 
private collectors 
state officials recognized the vargas painting was art but they 
also knew they didnt like it as advertising 
i dont like to censor anything and it was a picture done by a 
worldfamous chicago artist of another time thompson said 
but i thought the ad would be controversial and i didnt want 
folks talking about the ad i wanted them talking about chicago so 
i said no we are not going to run that 
state officials subsequently contacted both magazines and 
directed them not to publish the ad 
but a production assistant at time inadvertently picked up the 
wrong copy and some 400000 readers of the magazines european 
edition received the unauthorized invitation according to marianne 
floriano a spokeswoman for the state commerce department 
thompson said time officials apologized and agreed not to charge 
the state for the ad 
but playboy spokeswoman terry tomcisin suggested the flap was 
much ado about nothing 
we started here we are the bestselling mens magazine in the 
world and vargas association with playboy goes back a long way 
she said i think this whole thing just highlights the discrepancy 
between what americans and europeans find acceptable 
we sell 5 million copies worldwide and over in europe without 
controversy in fact she added were considered kind of tame 
over there

after two years of revelations and a 
lastminute prosecution surprise ptl founder jim bakker faces 
trial on charges of using tv telephones and the mail to defraud 
supporters out of millions of dollars 
jury selection in his fraud and conspiracy trial is set for 
monday opening arguments are to begin one week later and the trial 
is expected to last at least six weeks with dozens of witnesses and 
thousands of documents 
bakker whose multimilliondollar evangelical empire crumbled 
after word leaked about his sexual tryst with a church secretary is 
charged in a 24count indictment with diverting millions in ptl 
money to support a lavish lifestyle 
if convicted on all counts he could be sentenced to 120 years in 
prison and ordered to pay more than 5 million in fines 
the case against bakker resulted from a 16month federal grand 
jury investigation into ptl which once boasted 129 million in 
revenue under his leadership 
richard dortch bakkers former top aide at the nowbankrupt 
television ministry and former codefendant agreed on aug 8 to 
plead guilty to four counts and to testify against bakker 
dortch pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud one count of 
wire fraud by telephone one count of wire fraud by television and 
one count of conspiracy 
its got to have some effect on the approach taken at 
trial one of bakkers attorneys george t davis said of 
dortchs testimony but these kind of people who make these kinds 
of pleas are not always considered as credible as they might be 
the bakker trial follows the tax evasion convictions of two 
former ptl aides brothers david and james taggart in the same 
federal courtroom 
the taggarts attorney ben cotten said his clients would 
consider testifying against bakker 
david taggart who was bakkers personal aide and james taggart 
his former interior designer are scheduled to be sentenced on aug 
25 three days opening arguments in bakkers trial 
the taggarts each face 25 years in prison and more than 1 
million in fines when they are sentenced by us district judge 
robert potter who also will preside over the upcoming bakker trial 
they were convicted july 25 
its been more than two years since bakker stepped down as 
chairman of ptl following revelations about his sexual encounter 
with secretary jessica hahn and hush money paid to her by ptl 
the story broke in march 1987 disclosures about jim and tammy 
bakkers extravagant spending habits on homes cards and jewelry 
ptls bankruptcy proceedings and charges of homosexuality by former 
bakker associates touched off an unprecedented holy war among 
some of americas most prominent televangelists including jerry 
falwell and jimmy swaggart 
the federal grand jury heard testimony from more than 100 
witnesses reviewed thousands of documents and watched tapes of old 
ptl club shows 
its dec 5 indictment came almost eight years to the day after 
bakker and ms hahn had sex in a clearwater beach fla hotel room 
dec 6 1980 dortch was accused of giving her 265000 in ptl 
money in exchange for her silence 
bakker is charged with eight counts of mail fraud 15 counts of 
wire fraud and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud 
specifically he is accused of pocketing some of the 158 million 
that poured into ptl from 1984 to 1987 under various lifetime 
partnership programs 
in eight of the 11 programs contributors were promised free 
lodging at the ministrys heritage usa christian retreat near 
charlotte in exchange for a onetime donation of 1000 or more 
instead of using all of the money to build hotels and other 
facilities at heritage usa the indictment said ptl executives 
spent more than 4 million on themselves and used some of it for 
operating expenses 
all the while ptl was suffering from severe cashflow problems 
as jim and tammy bakker received nearly 35 million in bonuses from 
1984 through 1987 and dortch got 550000 in bonuses at the same 
time they withheld informaton about ptls worsening financial 
problems from its board of directors the indictment charged 
tammy bakker was not charged 
prosecutors deborah smith who works in the fraud section of the 
us department of justice and assistant us attorney jerry miller 
have declined to discuss details of the upcoming trial 
bakker and his defense attorneys also are mum saying they 
believe it will be impossible to get a fair trial in charlotte 
because of extensive pretrial publicity particularly in the 
charlotte observer 
the newspaper won a pulitizer prize last year for its 
investigative stories about ptl under bakkers leadership he 
resigned when the observers editors told him they were prepared to 
go to print with a story spelling out the details of the 
sexandmoney scandal 
defense attorneys failed in their attempts to move the trial out 
of charlotte 
davis bakkers lawyer said the judge has said he believes its 
possible to select a fair jury and if thats true i cant think 
of anything were more anxious to do than to go to trial he said

a public opinion poll has thrust the issue of 
quebec independence back into the canadian political arena although 
quebeckers rejected separatism in a referendum nearly a decade ago 
the gallup poll indicated that 28 percent of canadians believe 
frenchspeaking quebec should become an independent country 
according to gallup it was the strongest support for separatism 
nationally since the companys pollsters first asked the question 
more than 20 years ago 
perhaps the most startling finding of the poll of 1034 canadians 
was that 27 percent of englishspeaking canadians and 36 percent of 
frenchspeaking canadians favored quebecs becoming a separate 
nation 
there long has been resentment in parts of englishspeaking 
canada especially in the west of what is perceived as favoritism 
or special treatment for quebec but the percentage of those who 
would just as soon see it separate from canada had not been 
perceived to be as high as the poll indicated 
prime minister brian mulroney a native of quebec brushed the 
poll findings aside 
the heartbeat of the nation is strong its vigorous and its 
resolved to even greater unity he said 
its kind of silly to ask canadians whether they want to divide 
their country or to strip their country the answer when you strip 
away the varnish is absolutely no 
mulroney conceded that some linguistic tensions exist in canada 
but said that always has been the case 
indeed a focus in the canadian news media on the national unity 
issue may be as much a result of a languid summer without much else 
attracting attention as to any concrete developments in quebec 
premier robert bourassa of quebec who opposes separatism 
appears virtually certain to win the election expected in early 
fall possibly with an even greater margin of victory for his 
provincial liberal party than in 1985 when it won 99 of 122 seats in 
the quebec legislature 
the parti quebecois which found success with its separatist 
message in the 1970s has fallen on hard times and the economic 
prosperity that has lasted in quebec along with most of canada for 
seven years makes this an unlikely time for a comeback 
quebec canadas largest and second most populous province with 
65 million people is 81 percent frenchspeaking 
no one is predicting a new surge of the separatist movement the 
poll results were a reminder of how intractable the frenchenglish 
issues are in canada and the difficulties of running a country in 
which nine provinces are majority englishspeaking and one 
frenchspeaking 
among those expessing unease however was john turner the 
retiring leader of the naional liberal party which sits in 
opposition to mulroneys progressive conservatives 
i have during the course of the last six or nine months 
experienced and felt a deterioration in the mood of the country 
turner said i believe all those who share with me the view of a 
tolerant bilingual federation working in equilibrium should be 
concerned 
quebec barely surfaced as an issue in the national election this 
past november when the big issue was the free trade agreement with 
the united states 
mulroneys victory allowed the pact to take effect as scheduled 
jan 1 and quebec was a center of support for the agreement and its 
native son mulroneys progressive conservatives do not run in 
quebecs provincial elections 
but the quebec governments refusal last winter to remove its 
restrictions on bilingual signs despite a supreme court of canada 
decision touched off resentment among the provinces english 
minority and in englishspeaking provinces 
french is required throughout quebec as the only language on most 
outdoor signs 
there also has been growing realization that the meech lake 
accord a constitutional agreement recognizing quebec as a 
distinct society may not make its deadline on june 23 for 
ratification by all 10 provinces 
the atlantic coast province of new brunswick and manitoba in the 
west have yet to ratify the agreement and threats have been made to 
reconsider ratification elsewhere before the deadline 
the meech lake accord developed because quebec had refused to 
join the nine other provinces in signing the national constitution 
at the outset of the decade the constitution still applies to 
quebec even without its signature but the impasse makes it more 
difficult for changes to be made on such national issues as native 
rights and the way the senate operates 
quebec voters rejected sovereignty in a 1980 referendum after a 
dizzying decade in which power shifted from the english minority to 
the french majority 
the parti quebecois governed the province from 1976 to 1985 but 
lost its spirit after 60 percent of quebecs voters in the 1980 
referendum rejected separation

oncebustling beirut emptied of most of its 
population is now filled with despair those who remain can do 
little but wait for the end here is a report on how they survive 
under a constant rain of shells 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after five months of day and night 
shelling by christian and syrian forces beirut has been abandoned 
by 90 percent of its people it is a living hell for those who still 
huddle in its ruins 
were living like rats underground hiding in fear in shelters 
for endless days and nights lamented salwa ashkar a 22yearold 
maronite catholic woman who runs a beauty parlor in christian east 
beirut we cant take much more 
across the capitals dividing green line a moonscape of 
devastated apartment blocks infested by snipers life is as 
desperate for the moslems as well as the christians 
were going down the drain said mahmoud shami an 
engineering graduate from the american university of beirut who has 
no job and no future 
im trying to get out anywhere ill go to any country that 
will give me a visa said shami 24 
hospitals are running out of medicine theres no electricity or 
water the presidential palace atop a hill overlooking beirut in the 
christian suburb of baabda like most buildings has been blasted 
into rubble 
packs of stray dogs their ribs poking through their sides 
scavenge through the piles of flyinfested garbage in the streets 
rats some as big as cats scamper through the stinking mounds 
that lie feastering in the summer heat on nearly every alley corner 
beneath the rubblestrewn streets where power cables cut by 
shrapnel dangle from splintered wooden poles the estimated 150000 
beirutis who cling to what is left of their lives cower for days on 
end in underground bunkers or basement parking lots from the 
bombardment 
apartment building tenants crowd groundfloor entrances to cook 
whatever they have on makeshift stoves housewives hand out the 
meager fare the men venture out when they can to forage wood or 
anything that will burn 
there is nothing but despair after 14 years of civil war an 
israeli invasion and murderous street battles between rival 
militias surviving one day to the next is all beirutis can expect 
the capitals radio stations cut into programs to report which 
areas are being hit in between commercial breaks with bouncy 
jingles advertising scotch or hairsprays that seem grotesquely out 
of place 
the police who long ago lost all hope of maintaining law and 
order in a country that seemed bent on selfdestruction chronicle 
lebanons daily disasters with painstaking dedication 
they estimate that more than 13 million of the 15 million 
people who lived in beirut before the latest spasm of fighting 
between the christians and the syrians broke out march 8 have fled 
the city 
every day in moslem west beirut when the shelling eases people 
emerge from the bunkers load up cars and pickups with whatever they 
can carry and head south 
some find shelter with relatives but tens of thousands have to 
camp out along the coastal highway as they did when they fled the 
israeli siege of beirut in 1982 
they sleep in their cars or under plastic sheets 
for miles along the highway these refugees in their own land 
squat beside the road listening to the rumble of shellfire to the 
north ripping their city apart 
in east beirut the christians are not so lucky their 
310squaremile enclave shrunken after years of defeats in the 
civil war is ringed to the north south and east by the syrians and 
their allies 
the only way out is by sea past a syrian blockade on ships bound 
for cyprus not everyone makes it 
a christian couple lost their two daughters a few nights ago when 
syrian shellfire hit the speedboat ferrying them to a 
norwegianowned hydrofoil the santa maria that sneaks in at night 
the parents were separated when they were pulled from the 
mediterranean by the santa marias crew both thought the other had 
the children 
it wasnt until they reached the cypriot port of larnaca hours 
later that they bumped into each other and learned their children 
had been killed 
many christians had fled to the comparative safety of ski resorts 
of faraya harajel and ashkout in the pinestudded central 
mountains but it it expensive a tworoom apartment rents for about 
1800 a month 
some beirutis have stuck it out some have nowhere to go some 
have no money to get out some have just given up and wait for the 
end 
gaby the armenian who has had a barber shop in the basement of 
the commodore hotel for 15 years is still there he used to have 
hundreds of customers a month sipping scotch as he clipped their 
hair now hes lucky if he gets a dozen 
his best customers in the ruined hotel once headquarters for the 
foreign press are the 30 syrian soldiers billeted there if hes 
lucky they sometimes leave a tip 
mostly they dont bother paying he said what can i do 
theres nowhere for me to go anymore 
the christians paralyzed by a fuel shortage because of the 
blockade line up at gas stations gas canisters for cooking cost 
about 21 in more peaceful times they cost 1 
in the moslem sector fuel is more plentiful although still 
scarce oil and gas are brought in from syria but even thats 
becoming risky because the christians are shelling the mountain 
roads used by syrian convoys 
beiruts cafes and restaurants once the haunt of highrolling 
arab sheiks and their bejeweled women are closed no customers no 
power no water 
a few bistros open briefly during lulls along rubblestrewn hamra 
street the main commercial thoroughfare that once bustled with 
life but few risk sitting down for a coffee when a shell could blow 
them away at any minute 
along west beiruts corniche the syrians have set up artillery 
guns that shell the christian side across the bay they have become 
a favorite target for christian gunners which makes for dangerous 
living in the apartment blocks lining the corniche 
government offices banks businesses are closed what was left 
of the government system after years of fighting has ceased to 
function 
no one is being paid schools have been closed for months 
parents teach children at home often in the shelters during 
shelling 
central bank governor edmond naim lives in the buildings 
underground bunker and refuses to answer the telephone even when 
it is functioning because the bank isnt operating 
christian leader gen michel aoun huddles in his bunker two 
floors below the presidential palace which has been demolished by 
syrian shellfire 
simon khoury aouns spokesman said the twostory 35room 
complex has been hit by 10 240mm mortar rounds designed to knock

eternal flame at the mansion called graceland many left single 
roses at presleys graveside beside the swimming pool the rock n 
roll pioneer died aug 16 1977 
he just had everything said laurie cousins who waited on a 
sidewalk for 13 hours to be first in line for the procession he 
had looks he had charisma he had everything

a defense attorney sees the mcmartin preschool 
molestation trial as a cottage industry event and legal experts 
say its protracted length is symptomatic of a bloated unworkable 
justice system 
with the trial in its third year and the charges against raymond 
buckey and his mother 6 years old the mcmartin case has set records 
in criminal law and its not over yet 
in april the trial became the longest in us history 
surpassing the twoyear record of the hillside strangler case its 
cost was estimated recently at 15 million and climbing 
this trial has become a cottage industry event said buckeys 
attorney danny davis it made experts out of people who testified 
it became an annuity for attorneys it has regularly been a ratings 
focus for television lots of carpet baggers glom on and make 
hay 
the chief prosecutor deputy district attorney lael rubin says 
that although mcmartin is the longest trial its not that unusual 
i would say that in many respects the mcmartin case is like 
other cases that take much too long to go through the system and 
come to a conclusion she said 
ms rubin blames the defense for the trials length citing 
interminable crossexaminations she says 80 percent of the 14 
months she spent presenting her case was taken up by defense 
inquiries 
the defense blames the prosecution 
mcmartin is a case that may have been doomed to excesses 
davis says it started in excess its core defect was numbers 
numbers of counts numbers of defendants numbers of children 
whatever you think of guilt or innocence there was no necessity to 
bring such a large case 
it began with buckeys arrest in 1983 and escalated to include 
six other teachers at the prestigious mcmartin preschool in the 
seaside community of manhattan beach prosecutors alleged that 
buckey his mother sister grandmother and three other women 
teachers had molested hundreds of tots at the school over five years 
but after an 18month preliminary hearing district attorney ira 
reiner dropped charges against five of the defendants saying there 
was insufficient evidence to prosecute them 
buckey now 31 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 62 were 
left to face trial on 64 counts of molestation and a shared count of 
conspiracy involving alleged molestation of 11 children 
since the trial began in april 1987 the jury of 12 with a backup 
panel of six alternates has been dwindling due to illness and 
employment problems with only one alternate left superior court 
judge william pounders worries that the case will be aborted if more 
jurors are lost a jury of 12 is required to decide a criminal case 
it is a probability this case will end in a mistrial 
pounders said recently vowing to do everything he can to avert 
that he has limited defense witnesses and lengthened the trial day 
to six hours attorneys hope to submit the case to jurors this year 
the system cant survive too many more mcmartins because its 
so long and expensive says peter aranella professor of criminal 
law at the university of california at los angeles 
aranella suggests that the time and money consumed by such a case 
reduces the chance for other defendants to receive trials 
in order to work he said the system must rely on plea 
bargaining to dispose of 80 percent to 90 percent of criminal 
prosecutions 
the adversarial trial system is too time consuming cumbersome 
and expensive to provide to every criminal defendant he said 
thats a fact of life that every actor in the criminal justice 
system understands 
the irony aranella says is that as long as the system can 
rely on plea bargaining to settle the majority of criminal 
prosecutions we can go on for a long time with these occasional 
show trials 
the national trend is toward longer and longer trials says 
albert alschuler professor of law at the university of chicago who 
calls the length of the mcmartin case incomprehensible 
american trials are just ridiculously too long with the result 
that we dont give them to everyone he said we pressure 
almost all defendants into plea bargains 
alschuler citing legal history says trials have been growing in 
length for the last century 
i think it was the late 18th century when the first criminal 
trial lasted longer than a day he said its been a gradual 
process of increasing trial complexity 
ms rubin thinks that mcmartin will lead to reforms with 
legislators moving to limit the length of jury selection and 
preliminary hearings but alschuler sees little chance for reform 
this is a great system for lawyers and lawyers control the 
criminal justice system alschuler said its not a great system 
for defendants and taxpayers but by god its a great system for 
lawyers

relations between roman catholics and jews have 
suffered new setbacks that threaten longterm efforts aimed at 
mending centuries of mistrust and misunderstanding 
officials on both sides are appealing for moderation to deal with 
the disputes involving a roman catholic convent at auschwitz and 
pope john paul iis recent remarks about gods covenant with the 
jews in which he said history showed israel had not always been 
faithful to gods law 
while expressing anger and disappointment jewish leaders in 
europe and the united states said relations with the church have 
improved substantially since the 196265 second vatican council and 
they want to continue the interfaith dialogue 
our relations have to overcome 2000 years of 
misunderstanding said rabbi leon klenicki director of interfaith 
affairs of the antidefamation league of bnai brith in new york 
and the groups liaison representative to the vatican you cant 
do it in 20 years what is crucial is to continue the dialogue and 
the relationship 
it has been a bumpy relationship during the 10year papacy of 
john paul 
rabbi marc h tanenbaum former chairman of the international 
jewish committee on interreligious consultations said relations 
have gone two steps forward one step backward 
the steps forward included john pauls visit to romes main 
synagogue in 1986 the first recorded visit by a pope to a jewish 
shrine and his talks with a delegation of american jews in 1987 
a step backward was the popes meeting at the vatican in 1982 
with plo leader yasser arafat then came the popes audience in 1987 
with austrian president kurt waldheim accused of complicity in nazi 
war crimes 
the holocaust has been a particular source of friction 
jews and others have questioned whether pope pius xii did enough 
during world war ii to stop hitlers campaign to exterminate the 
jews john paul was criticized for not mentioning jewish victims 
during his 1988 visit to the mauthausen concentration camp in 
austria although a few weeks later he spoke of the particular 
measure of extermination suffered by jews 
in a 1987 papal letter released in the united states john paul 
said christians approach with fearsome respect the terrifying 
experience of the extermination suffered by the jews during 
the war 
still some jewish groups say the pope has not gone far enough 
and that he treats the holocaust as not exclusively a jewish tragedy 
nobel laureate elie wiesel a holocaust survivor and author 
recently accused john paul of trying to dejudaize the holocaust 
by ignoring jewish suffering in speeches and comments about that era 
the holocaust is at the root of the latest dispute which 
involves a carmelite convent at oswiecim poland a few feet from 
the fence surrounding the auschwitz concentration camp 
jewish groups say the convent and its christian symbols such as 
a 23foot cross offend the memory of the 25 million jews who died 
there 
under an accord signed by catholic and jewish leaders in 1987 
the nuns were supposed to have moved by feb 22 to a prayer center 
to be built several thousand yards away 
the deadline passed and the center has yet to be built jewish 
groups accused the polish church of reneging 
what was supposed to be and should have been a discreet and 
loving gesture of conciliation and reconciliation because of delays 
has become a stumbling block on the path of jewishcatholic 
relations said tullia zevi president of the union of italian 
jewish communities and a signatory to the 1987 accord 
after a series of demonstrations at the convent by american 
jewish activists cardinal franciszek macharski announced aug 10 he 
was suspending the agreement to move the nuns he blamed western 
jewish groups for launching a violent campaign of accusations and 
slanders and creating an atmosphere of aggressive demands 
many jews want the pope to intervene 
the pope himself sparked a controversy with his remarks during 
two recent general audiences about gods covenant with moses on 
mount sinai 
on aug 2 the pope said god selected jews as the chosen people 
on condition that they remained faithful to his law 
but the history of the old testament shows many instances of 
israels infidelity to god he said hence god sent the prophets 
as his messengers to call the people to conversion to warn them of 
their hardness of heart and to foretell a new covenant still to 
come 
the antidefamation league of bnai brith protested expressing 
profound concern at the comments and said it hoped the clock 
of catholicjewish relations has not been tragically set back 
the group said the popes remarks suggested the new covenant with 
christianity had replaced and superseded the alliance with jews who 
believe that gods covenant with them is everlasting 
jewish leaders said the popes remarks contradicted the second 
vatican councils 1965 document nostra aetate in our times which 
officially rescinded the accusation that the jews killed christ 
that document is considered a turning point in catholicjewish 
relations 
the rev pier francesco fumagalli an official of the vaticans 
office for relations with jews confirmed he received the 
antidefamation leagues letter of protest and said it would be 
studied otherwise the vatican has not commented publicly on the 
issue

about robert j buckleys business dealings and professional 
competency were made in the aug 11 1986 issue of the magazine

the crowd was smaller the musicians amateur 
and saabs replaced sandals as the favored form of transportation 
but hundreds of people donned tiedyed shirts to conjure the spirit 
of woodstock anyway 
twenty years after richie havens opened the woodstock festival 
before 400000 people the late max yasgurs old farm filled with 
revelers tuesday to celebrate one of rock n rolls most sacred 
anniversaries 
it was a deeply spiritual experience and certainly people would 
want to come back said comedian wavy gravy the only one of 
woodstocks original performers 
gravy wearing a beanie with a propeller and carrying a walking 
stick topped with a pigs snout waved to festival veterans before 
being ushered into a forest of satellite dishes for one of dozens of 
interviews 
more free enterprise than free love was evident at the upstate 
new york meadow as tourists could choose between tshirts emblazoned 
with i survived the woodstock reunion and was i late 
i really honor the people whose spread this is for allowing 
this to take place gravy said its very folksy 
it wasnt without a price a man who said he was a relative of 
the fields new owners louis nicky and june gelish of new york 
city asked a 5 field restoration donation from each carload 
police said the owners squabbled with merchants who tried to sell 
their wares 
true to the spirit of the original woodstock when fans swarmed 
over fences to transform it into a free concert some motorists just 
waited until the landlord looked the other way and snuck their 
vehicles onto the field 
police were on hand to make sure traffic kept moving there were 
no arrests said sgt charles kulick of the sullivan county 
sheriffs department he estimated the crowd at about 600 the 
largest of a celebration that had been building for a week 
the most tension came when television reporters nervously 
approaching 6 pm deadlines competed for space near the 
commemorative plaque that is the only permanent fixture on the 
alfalfa field 
i didnt really know what to expect said ralph corwin a 
resident of upstate new york who said he attended the original show 
and has returned every year since im just thankful that they let 
us go back the numbers have fallen down but the spirit hasnt 
died 
on the same corner where jimi hendrix the who the jefferson 
airplane and the grateful dead performed 20 years earlier a 
makeshift stage was built for stray amateur guitarists one singer 
replaced country joe mcdonalds infamous gimme an f cheer with

an indian reservation sounded like a good 
home for a buffalo herd but the chippewa tribe wishes someone would 
take them away 
we dont want a herd of buffalo said fred fritz monette 
a chippewa tribal councilman unfortunately we got stuck with a 
herd of buffalo and we dont know what to do with them 
feeding the herd is costing the tribe about 100 a week and will 
become more expensive come winter he said monday 
the national park service gave the herd to the turtle mountain 
indian reservation under a program that distributes surplus animals 
to reservations 
the herd has grown from nine head in 1984 to 29 
louise crosby claims the tribe is trying to cut expenses by 
starving the buffalo to see them starve like that is a horrible 
thing she said 
crosby who ran a game farm before selling her animals to the 
minot zoo said she offered to buy the buffalo to show the tribe how 
extreme she thinks the situation is but she said she doesnt really 
want them because she too is daunted by feed costs 
monette and tribal chairman twila martinkekahbah deny the 
buffalo are starving 
they cost some money to the tribe which we really cant 
afford martinkekahbah said however the buffalo are not 
starving some believe the buffalo are better taken care of than the 
membership 
richard peltier caretaker for the buffalo said the animals 
usually are fed between 15 gallons to 30 gallons of ground barley a 
day the tribe also buys 80 to 90 bales of hay a year for the herd 
he said and provides a barrel of canned food supplement and a salt 
block the herd also has a large springfed water hole he said 
i think they are fed better than a lot of places peltier 
said 
complaints from people like crosby may stem from a 
misunderstanding about how buffalo should look he said a person 
has to get pretty close to them to see what shape they are in he 
said 
monette said the tribe is asking for suggestions on how it might 
reduce the herd to a manageable size possibly by auctioning or 
donating animals

the bush administration seeking ways to boost 
the us savings rate to cure a variety of economic ills appears to 
be inching closer to recommending increased tax incentives for 
thrifty americans 
us trade representative carla hills added her support to the 
idea tuesday saying that expanding individual retirement accounts 
would make her job of reducing americas huge trade deficits easier 
millions of american savers could benefit through expanded iras 
which enjoyed great popularity earlier in the decade but it could 
cost the us treasury billions of dollars in lost tax revenue 
hills in an interview with reporters stressed that she was not 
signaling an imminent administration announcement on iras however 
other officials said a proposed increase in tax incentives for iras 
is high on the list of options being studied by the administration 
americans personal savings rate savings as a percentage of 
aftertax income fell to a 40year low of 32 percent in 1987 and 
increased only slightly to 42 percent last year 
by contrast japan the country with the worlds largest trade 
surplus had a savings rate of 165 percent in 1987 
administration officials said they are planning a fall campaign 
to be led by treasury secretary nicholas brady focusing on the 
countrys chronic low savings rate and proposing ways to correct the 
problem 
the huge cost of iras was one reason they were greatly scaled 
back by the 1986 tax reform act as a result the number of tax 
returns claiming ira deductions fell from 155 million in 1987 to 
74 million last year 
in endorsing increased tax incentives for iras hills said it 
would highlight the great need for private savings to go up it 
sends up a flag saying this is very important not only to your 
nation but to your own future and to your children 
a key reason advanced for americas high trade deficits is the 
fact that americans consume more than the country can produce 
domestically economists argue that if americans can be persuaded to 
cut back consumption and save more it would limit the need for 
foreign goods 
a higher savings rate would expand the pool of available funds in 
this country and lower the cost of borrowing by us businesses 
making them more competitive internationally 
the bush administration is negotiating with japan on us demands 
for the japanese to lower trade barriers erected against foreign 
goods 
hills said cutting the federal budget deficit which drains away 
savings and efforts to boost personal savings would counter 
japanese arguments that america is not doing enough at home to fix 
its trading problems 
in recent weeks budget director richard darman and federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan have issued their own warnings about 
the need to increase the us savings rate 
darman attacked americas cultural nownowism which he 
defined as an unrestrained appetite for satisfying immediate wants 
at the expense of longterm goals 
greenspan testifying before congress earlier in the month 
called raising the us savings rate the crucial issue for the 
longterm economic outlook of the country 
hills is holding negotiations with japan brazil and india in an 
effort to get those nations to lower trade barriers cited by the 
administration in may in a hit list of the most harmful 
impediments to us trade 
the administration is holding separate talks with japan on 
socalled structural impediments that keep foreign companies from 
doing business in japan such as the japanese distribution system 
however she warned that despite the administrations best 
efforts the us trade deficit is likely to widen a little in 
the next 18 months because the dollar has increased in value making

the bush administration is engaging the kremlin 
in a mild war of words over attempts by polands solidarity trade 
union to form a noncommunist government in that soviet bloc country 
questions involving the government of poland are properly an 
internal affair state department spokesman richard boucher said 
tuesday he was using a diplomatic formula that recalled the flavor 
but not the intensity of 198081 when solidarity last challenged 
the polish communist party leading to martial law 
in moscow the soviet communist party daily pravda warned that 
efforts by solidarity leader lech walesa to form a noncommunist 
government were against the principles of parliamentary 
democracy and could lead to a prolonged political crisis 
the opposition has changed its strategy and has taken the 
course of an immediate seizure of power pravda said the 
commentary noted that fixing the polish economy required a coalition 
of political forces including the communists 
the commentary contrasted with recent soviet media reports on 
poland soviet television recently broadcast neutral coverage of 
such solidarity leaders as walesa and bronislaw geremek and 
highlighted a visit last month by filmmaker andrzej wajda a 
solidarity supporter and member of parliament who served as a judge 
in the moscow film festival 
an independent washingtonbased analyst janusz bugajski said 
the soviet commentary means that they are trying to send a message 
to the government and to solidarity that things have gone far 
enough 
the soviets have given the countries of eastern europe a free 
hand over the past few years but they may be reassessing that 
policy said bugajski a scholar at the center for strategic and 
international studies and author of the book eastern european 
fault lines 
polands communists he said would like to lure solidarity 
into a coalition to share blame for the deteriorating economy and 
soaring prices but do not want to surrender power especially of 
military and security forces 
solidarity leaders on the other hand are coming under pressure 
from rankandfile supporters to take advantage of elections this 
year that shattered the communists hold on parliament 
but solidarity is wary of sharing power with the communists and 
taking the fall for continuing economic and political problems said 
bugajski 
soviet leaders worry that poland ultimately may leave the warsaw 
pact defense alliance but know that a 1981style military crackdown 
would jeopardize the efforts of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev to improve relations with the west and reform the soviet 
system 
in warsaw walesa continued to jockey with communist authorities 
over who should lead the government 
walesa said he was willing to serve as prime minister if 
society wants it and polish president wojciech jaruzelski called 
for a joint meeting soon of the countrys major political leaders to 
find a rational solution for the deepening governmental crisis 
in an interview with warsaw radio polish service walesa issued 
an assurance clearly aimed at assuaging kremlin fears saying that 
changes in the polish government would not represent a threat to 
the warsaw pact 
state department spokesman boucher declined to comment directly 
on the pravda article but said us officials note that poland 
faces a difficult period of transition from a state dominated by one 
party to a more pluralistic and democratic system 
this process must be managed within poland itself the 
formation of a new polish government is an internal matter for the 
polish people to decide we hope that a new government will be 
formed as soon as possible he said 
another state department official speaking on condition of 
anonymity described the situation in poland as very delicate 
but said that the soviet warning was not viewed with great alarm in 
washington 
it was not even as strong as a shot across the bow said the 
source 
a third government source also speaking on condition that he not 
be further identified said us officials did not think it likely 
that gorbachev would choose or be forced by conservatives in his 
country to order a crackdown in poland in the near future

the moon plunges into the earths shadow 
tonight creating the first total lunar eclipse visible in north 
america since 1982 and thousands of telescopes are awaiting a 
celestial show of light and color 
the eclipse will start at 823 pm edt when the earths shadow 
appears to take its first nip from the full moon and will end about 
5 hours later 
the last full lunar eclipse visible over north america was in 
december 1982 and the next one will not occur until december 1992 
if the skies are clear east coast residents will get the best 
view the moon will be overhead with twilight ending just as the 
eclipse begins 
in time zones farther west the eclipse will start before sunset 
and moonrise cheating some americans out of seeing the full lunar 
show none of the eclipse will be visible in alaska 
moonrise in chicago for example will be at 743 pm cdt half 
an hour after the eclipse has started 
even more of the eclipse will take place below the horizon from 
the perspective of los angeles 
the moon will not become visible until sometime after 830 pm 
pdt according to a statement by the griffith observatory in los 
angeles and will be in eclipse as it rises 
this a rare event said an observatory official the last 
time the moon rose while totally eclipsed as seen from los angeles 
was on feb 5 1841 and it will not rise while totally eclipsed 
again as seen from los angeles until june 25 2029 
free telescopes have been set up at the griffith observatory for 
public viewing of the event 
in fort worth texas several local astronomical societies are 
staging an eclipsewatching party with free use of telescopes the 
first glimpse the texans will get of the moon will be about 755 
pm cdt when it already is eclipsing 
moon watch ii a free outdoor celebration of the eclipse and 
the 20th anniversary of apollo 11s lunar landing will be held in 
new york citys central park a small rocket will be launched to 
open the event followed by lectures on the eclipse and live 
entertainment featuring a dance called moon beams ii 
at the mcdonald observatory near fort davis texas astronomer 
art whipple plans to fire a laser beam at the moon during the 
darkest part of the eclipse 
he hopes the light will strike a reflector left on the moon in 
1971 by the apollo 15 astronauts if his aim is good a small bit of 
the laser light will bounce back almost a quarter million miles 
and be detected by telescopes at the observatory 
usually whipple said the experiment isnt attempted during a 
full moon because the natural light is too bright to see the 
reflected laser beam but when the full moon is eclipsed the 
returned beam can be spotted 
it provides us an opportunity to range fire the laser in a 
period we usually dont even try said whipple this gives us an 
opportunity to sample a portion of the moons orbit we dont 
normally get 
by clocking the time it takes for light to travel from the laser 
to the moon and then back to the mcdonald telescopes scientists are 
able to precisely measure the distance between the earth and its 
moon 
whipple said astronomers have discovered that the moon is moving 
away from the earth at the rate of about 2 inches a year the mean 
distance between the earth and moon is about 230000 miles 
observatories from coast to coast are expected to spend at least 
some time observing the event 
cloudy skies of course could spoil eclipseviewing plans at any 
point and the outlook was not good for much of the east forecasts 
for today and tonight along the east coast called for thunderstorms 
observers may have better luck in the central and western areas 
where the forecasts generally were for clear to partly cloudy skies 
with good local weather some phase of the spectacle should be 
visible to about a billion observers the moon will eclipse within 
view of north and south america western europe and africa and the 
antarctic 
a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the shadow 
created by the earth blocking the suns light the moon in its 
orbit of the earth usually passes above or below this shadowline 
but it occasionally follows a path that shades it completely for a 
time an event called a total eclipse 
during an eclipse the moon can appear to be a bright coppery red 
if there is a clean air between the lunar surface and the observer 
on earth if smoke or dust obscure the view the moon can dim to an 
faint orange color or even fade from view altogether

syrian troops pounded the christian 
enclave from all sides tuesday and mobilized militia allies in 
apparent preparation for an allout assault on the besieged area 
meanwhile in new york the un security council assembled in an 
emergency session by the secretarygeneral under a rarely used 
article of the un charter called late tuesday for an immediate 
truce in the 14yearold civil war and arab league mediation 
the 15 nations in the council urgently appeals to all the 
parties to put an immediate end to all operations and to all firing 
and all shelling on land and at sea said algerian ambassador 
hocine djoudi the council president 
it further appeals to all parties to observe a total and 
immediate ceasefire the un declaration read by djoudi said 
christian forces greatly outnumbered by syrian soldiers fought 
syrian troops with tanks and artillery along the southern eastern 
and northern edges of the 310squaremile enclave north of beirut 
syrian gunners also hammered the 28milelong christian 
coastline the christians only escape route 
police said 19 people were killed and 99 wounded in fighting by 
police count 760 people have been killed and 2045 wounded since 
the battles began march 8 
casualties tuesday included two young girls killed when a syrian 
shell hit their home in the christian port of byblos north of 
beirut and a moslem woman who was eight months pregnant doctors at 
beiruts makassed hospital said the baby survived 
the syrians who were reported massing troops and tanks in the 
mountains appeared to be trying to stretch gen michel aouns 
christian fighters who number 20000 to the syrians 40000 
aoun urged the 22000 moslem soldiers in the fractured army to 
join the christians 
the hour of unification has struck he said on the radio 
our reunion is essential to reunite the partitioned homeland and 
defeat the enemy 
the poorly equipped moslem soldiers have largely stayed out the 
fighting and were not expected to go against the powerful syrians 
international pressure was building for a ceasefire 
pope john paul ii his voice shaking with emotion said from 
castelgondolfo italy in the name of god i turn to the syrian 
authorities asking them to stop the bombardment that aims to 
destroy the whole country 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar called the 
emergency security council meeting tuesday after none of the 15 
council members took any lead in the issue and hours later the 
declaration prepared by the algerian ambassador that called for 
peace in lebanon was unanimously adopted 
the un charter allows the secretarygeneral to call such 
meetings when situations are deemed to threaten international 
security 
the last meeting of its type was held in 1979 after iran seized 
the us embassy in tehran said un spokesman francois giuliani 
the syrians summoned their moslem and leftist lebanese militia 
leaders to damascus for a council of war in what appeared to be a 
move to escalate the campaign against the christians 
the leaders of 16 factions including iranianbacked shiite 
groups and radical palestinian guerrillas attended 
syrias staterun damascus radio pledged that aoun will be 
defeated not by the syrian army but by the nationalist and moslem 
forces 
syrias tactic in recent years has been to use its militia allies 
to do most of the ground fighting while syrian artillery and armor 
provide support giving damascus room for diplomatic maneuvering 
until the last few days most militias had stayed stayed out of 
the fighting 
assem kanso leader of the lebanese chapter of syrias ruling 
baath socialist party said after the meeting we shall fight a 
decisive battle with aoun and we shall foil the plots he is 
hatching 
the duels began after aoun the army commander and head of a 
christian government vying for power with a moslem cabinet 
blockaded illegal ports run by syrianbacked militias south of 
beirut 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said the syrians had expanded the confrontation to 
cover all the christian enclave in an apparent effort to shatter 
aouns forces and deplete their stocks of ammunition 
he said the syrian move was in apparent preparation for a new 
offensive against aouns defenses 
a syrian attempt to storm the christians strategic souk elgharb 
garrison on sunday was repulsed 
aoun said he expected the syrians to strike at the upper metn 
area north of souk algharb 
theyll try again and again and again said a spokesman for 
aouns command 
an israeli legislator said israel planned to warn syria of 
certain lines it should not cross in lebanon if syria passes these 
points the israeli military might intervene said uzi landau of the 
rightwing likud bloc following a report by the defense minister 
officials have said in the past that israel would not tolerate 
syrian troops south of the awali river about 25 miles from israels 
border or into areas from which israel withdrew in 1985 in the 
bekaa valley

the handicapped are losing earning power 
because those who do manage to find jobs often get lowlevel 
positions with little chance for advancement says a disabled 
vietnam veteran from south dakota 
disabled men earned 64 percent as much as male employees in 
general in 1987 while disabled women made 62 percent of the amount 
earned by all female workers the census bureau reported tuesday 
that was down from 77 percent for handicapped men and 69 percent 
for disabled women in 1980 the report said 
one major reason speculated gene murphy of sioux falls sd is 
that handicapped workers are often placed in a limited type of job 
and simply left there 
companies say well how can he ever move up they give him a 
job in the back room sorting mail and they dont ever look at him 
again he isnt reviewed when they advance other employees said 
murphy a disabled vietnam veteran who directs the south dakota 
office of disabled american veterans 
many companies are leery of hiring the disabled he added noting 
that companies may fear having to spend money on special 
accommodations or that the worker will be out sick a lot 
that may be partly why the employment rate among the disabled has 
also declined in the 1980s murphy speculated its harder for the 
really disabled veteran or individual to become employed 
other factors in that drop could include concern by the 
handicapped over losing their medicare and medicaid benefits and 
the lack of strong laws encouraging hiring the disabled said paul 
hippolitus director of plans projects and services for the 
presidents committee on employment of the handicapped 
for disabled men the share working fulltime fell from 298 
percent in 1981 to 234 percent in 1988 the census bureau reported 
disabled women increased slightly with 114 percent working 
fulltime in 1981 growing to 131 percent in 1988 
parttime disabled male workers dropped from 419 percent to 358 
percent parttime female workers rose from 235 percent to 275 
percent 
laws mandating equal employment for the disabled do not cover all 
employers and have failed to have a major impact hippolitus said in 
a telephone interview 
as to the relative income decline hippolitus agreed with murphy 
that many companies think only in terms of entrylevel positions 
for the disabled and tend to leave them there 
people with disabilities have the greatest problems with upward 
mobility and career advancement they are perceived as fitting into 
some particular area but not as moving up as everybody else moves 
up the career ladder they dont hippolitus said 
the census bureau study the first to compare the employment of 
disabled people over time does not include explanations for the 
changes in income and employment it is based on the current 
population survey which conducts interviews with about 60000 
households every month 
the report classified people as disabled if they reported a 
health problem that prevented them from working or limited the types 
of work they could do but it did not specify particular types of 
disabilities the study covered people ages 16 to 64 
average earnings of disabled males rose from 12579 in 1980 to 
15497 in 1987 but in the same period earnings of all male workers 
climbed from 16362 to 24095 
for disabled women earnings rose from 5335 to 8075 while 
earnings of all women went from 7770 to 13000 
the years used to compare employment rates differ slightly from 
those used to compare income because while people were asked about 
their disabilities at the time of the study they were asked to list 
their earnings in the prior year 
the employment figures for the disabled in 1988 also disclosed 
that blacks were most likely to be disabled at 137 percent 
compared with 82 percent of hispanic americans and 79 percent of 
whites

the share of jobless workers who get 
unemployment insurance has never been lower mainly due to stricter 
government regulations and a shift to a service economy a private 
research group says 
only 315 percent of all unemployed workers 21 million out of 
67 million received benefits in the average month last year the 
liberal center on budget and policy priorities said tuesday 
that percentage tied the record low measured in 1987 and was the 
sixth straight year that the proportion receiving assistance has not 
improved 
researchers at the washingtonbased center conceded that the 
figure was not as alarming as it appears on its surface because 
large numbers of jobless people do not qualify for public 
assistance nonetheless they said the finding is significant 
because it shows that the public safety net is shrinking 
the record low level of unemployment insurance coverage in 1988 
not only indicates an economic security problem for todays 
unemployed but it also may be a harbinger of what will occur in the 
event of a new recession the groups report said 
the center calculated the figures using department of labor 
statistics 
isaac shapiro a researcher at the center who helped write the 
report attributed the high number of jobless people without 
insurance to a tendency for workers to be out of work longer than 
before public unemployment programs expire after a fixed period 
usually 26 weeks for state aid and 13 additional weeks for federal 
benefits that last year were available in only one state alaska 
shapiro cited federal and state eligibility restrictions that 
were tightened during the 1980s he said another factor was the 
increase in service jobs at the expense of manufacturing positions 
where workers are more likely to be notified by their union or 
company that they can apply for assistance 
with a service economy its less likely people might know 
theyre eligible he said 
mary ann wyrsch director of unemployment insurance in the 
department of labor did not dispute the reports statistics 
but she said many of the jobless dont qualify for unemployment 
insurance because they did not work long enough left their jobs 
voluntarily or were fired for adverse actions historically only 
about 40 percent of the jobless receive coverage she said 
were concerned about the difference between the 40odd percent 
and the 31 percent that is reported by the center she said 
between 1955 the earliest year for which figures are available 
and 1984 the percentage of covered workers dropped below 40 percent 
only once when it hit 393 percent in 1966 
the nations unemployment rate has dropped steadily since 1982 
when it reached 97 percent it was 55 percent last year 
the center said the situation was worst for minorities just 21 
percent of unemployed blacks and 14 percent of jobless hispanics 
received unemployment benefits last year according to the report 
in 28 states and the district of columbia twoparent families 
with a jobless worker can get other assistance even if they do not 
receive unemployment insurance 
the proportion of jobless workers receiving benefits last year 
varied widely among the states from 173 percent in florida to 72 
percent in rhode island 
only in four states did most unemployed workers get insurance 
rhode island massachusetts where 573 percent were covered alaska 
with 515 percent and vermont with 502 percent 
by contrast there were 16 states where less than oneinfour 
jobless workers was covered alabama arizona colorado florida 
georgia indiana kentucky louisiana mississippi new hampshire 
new mexico oklahoma south dakota texas virginia and west

farmers are paying more for gasoline diesel 
fuel and other forms of energy but an agriculture department 
economist says the total bill isnt much different from the early 
1970s if inflation is taken into account 
economist richard nehring also said that the switch from gasoline 
to dieselpowered tractors has prompted a sharp reduction in the 
amount of fuel used per acre 
overall 1989 farm energy prices are expected to remain above 
1988 levels because of higher crude oil costs in recent months 
according to a report by the departments economic research service 
energy spending by farmers are forecast to increase about 6 
percent from 1988 to around 75 billion reflecting the higher 
prices and greater fuel use needed to handle an expansion in crop 
acres the report said 
nehring one of the authors of the report said in a telephone 
interview tuesday that the 75 billion forecast for 1989 farm 
energy expenditures will be the highest since 1985 when spending 
totaled 9 billion 
the record farm energy bill which includes diesel fuel gasoline 
and lp gas from liquefied petroleum was about 102 billion in 1981 
at the peak of the oil crunch in 1974 by comparison the farm 
energy bill was around 3 billion 
but those are nominal costs for specific years and dont take 
general inflation into account when that is done nehring said the 
farm fuel bill overall wont be much different from 1974 
for example using 1967 dollars as a base the governments 
consumer price index for all items increased from an average of 
1477 percent in 1974 to 3404 percent by 1987 and has continued to 
rise 
nehring said that the consumption of fuels used by farmers has 
declined significantly since the mid1970s 
roughly the consumption of gasoline diesel fuel and lp per 
cultivated acre declined from about 24 gallons in the mid1970s to 
about 15 gallons currently he said that basically reflects the 
replacement of gasoline by diesel fuel 
in its report the agency said us refiners paid an average of 
1650 per barrel in the first quarter of 1989 up about 25 percent 
from the last quarter of 1988 for all of this year crude oil 
prices are expected to be in the range of 15 to 20 per barrel 
nehring said the peak year was 1981 when crude oil averaged 33 
per barrel triple the 11 of 1976 
net imports of oil are expected to rise by more than 10 percent 
this year to a daily average of 7 million barrels or 41 percent of 
domestic consumption the record was 86 million barrels a day in 
1977 or 47 percent of us consumption imports dropped to 43 
million barrels daily in 1985 only 27 percent of use 
onfarm use of diesel fuel declined about 3 percent last year due 
to the drought while gasoline and lp use held steady but with a 
return for better weather and larger crop plantings diesel use by 
farmers is expected to jump 14 percent this year

wanted big beautiful beast one of 
last of dying breed as possible mate for same serious inquiries 
only 
thats the pitch a group of zoologists is making to zookeepers 
around the country their matchmaking service a sort of modernday 
noahs ark could be the last hope for many wild animals facing 
extinction 
this ark is fashioned from computer software and cooperation 
through it a black rhino calf was born in detroit to a mother 
swapped from oklahoma city whose seven previous offspring had lived 
less than a month logistically it was difficult and expensive 
said doris applebaum registrar at the detroit zoological park she 
said the switch cost around 6000 but it was well worth it 
the calf born in march was doing well on tuesday applebaum said 
the black rhino is declining at a rate of 97 percent per 
generation said nathan flesness director of international species 
information system which compiles data for the animal swapping 
program the animals population has plummeted from 70000 in 1970 
to about 3000 today and captivity may be the key to its 
preservation 
humans shoot them to sell their horns for enough to retire on 
for the rest of their life said flesness 
the program with headquarters here in the minnesota zoo is 
called the species survival plan it was set up by the american 
association of zoological parks and aquariums in 1980 with a goal 
not only of matching animals but also of convincing zookeepers that 
donating or swapping some of their most prized possessions is in the 
longterm interest of their profession 
fifty species including the gorilla cheetah and thickbilled 
parrot so far have climbed aboard the computer ark thomas foose 
the programs coordinator says he hopes that number will increase 
tenfold by the start of the next century 
the choice of species to include usually comes down to the big 
and the beautiful said flesness its a long way short of 
everything but its a lot better than doing nothing 
fooses group tracks data including genealogy and medical 
history compiled by the isis on over 96000 living vertebrate 
specimens in 347 zoos and 32 countries 
foose says that as a result of the gorilla program for example 
there is less inbreeding and healthier babies are being born about 
15 gorillas have been born a year for the last 10 years with the 
population presently at about 300 weve gone from a situation 
where that population was declining to one where its increasing by 
about 2 or 3 percent a year he said thats very healthy 
gorilla mating is difficult since longestablished pairs tend to 
treat each other like brother and sister 
the solution flesness said is just a plane ride away put one 
of the two partners on airplanes switch them to another zoo and 
let them make friends 
while conservationists once had misgivings about keeping exotic 
animals in captivity they now are realizing the role zoos can play 
in preservation said flesness 
wildlife managers he said increasingly realize they have a 
small population and that it is often in one place they want to 
take their species into captivity for insurance reasons and they 
suddenly move into the same arena the same set of challenges as 
zoos 
the puerto rican parrot is an example fortythree of the birds 
exist in the wild on the island and an equal number live in 
captivity there 
if one bad hurricane comes theyll not only wipe out the wild 
birds but at least endanger the ones in the aviary said flesness 
conservationists he said have agreed that a few of the animals 
should be moved to a mainland zoo 
the prospects of easing animals back into the wild look bleak he 
said as long as humans keep encroaching on their natural habitat 
the species that are going to make it out there are the ones 
that can handle lots of bulldozers highway disturbance and little 
teeny spots of semiwild land left he said 
the big ones are the ones that are going to go unless we do 
something radically different whats surprising is that theyre 
going to go in our lifetime

the united states plans to argue its case 
before the world court in a suit by iran over the us downing of an 
iranian jetliner but a bush administration spokesman declines to 
say whether the decision will be abided 
state department spokesman richard boucher made the announcement 
tuesday shortly after president bush told a white house news 
conference that he hoped to end a decadelong estrangement from 
tehran and that iran could help free american hostages held in 
lebanon 
the us government has offered to pay the families of the 290 
passengers and crew members who died july 3 1988 when the uss 
vincennes shot down the iranian airbus in the mistaken belief it was 
an attacking f14 fighter 
however the united states has refused to give the compensation 
to the iranian government insisting that it go directly to the 
relatives 
we have not gotten an official response yet from iran on 
compensation boucher said we continue to hope that iran will do 
the right thing for its citizens 
iran filed suit may 17 in the world court located at the hague 
and formally known as the international court of justice alleging 
that the united states violated the seattle and montreal conventions 
on civil aviation the lawsuit demands payment 
no date for the trial has been set 
us attorneys argue that civil aviation conventions dont apply 
to the vincennes which was protecting shipping in the persian gulf 
during the iraniraq war iran pulled out of the war shortly after 
the jetliner was shot down 
in this case the uss vincennes acted on the belief that the 
airliner was a hostile military aircraft boucher said the mere 
fact that this belief was erroneous does not make the act of the 
vincennes unlawful 
boucher asked whether the us decision to participate in the 
case means that washington will respect any ruling by the court 
said 
i dont think you can say it is an irrevocable decision binding 
us to whatever happens we have the inherent right of selfdefense 
we wouldnt accept limitations on that right 
the decision to argue the suit boucher said shows the us 
desire to work within the court it shows our willingness to 
support the work of the court in appropriate cases 
the decision was disclosed against the backdrop of efforts to 
restore diplomatic relations with tehran and win iranian help in 
freeing american hostages 
we dont have to be hostile with iran for the rest of our 
lives bush said i think that if iran decided they wanted those 
hostages to come out of there there would be a good likelihood that 
that would happen perhaps not with certainty but a good 
likelihood 
the reagan administration dubbed the 15member panel a 
propaganda forum in 1984 when nicaragua took the united states 
to court to seek an injunction against us support for the contras 
the united states walked out halfway through the proceedings 
saying the court had no jurisdiction after 17 months the court 
ordered an immediate halt to all american aid to the contras 
the court is reviewing a nicaraguan demand for us compensation 
for damages inflicted by the rebels during their sevenyear 
insurgency the united states isnt participating in that procedure 
we did appear in the nicaragua case in order to enable the 
court to determine whether it has jurisdiction boucher said 
the courts decision in that case we found to be untenable 
since the 1985 walkout the united states has been involved in 
two other cases losing both times 
the court ruled last month that italian authorities had legally 
confiscated the sicilian branch of a us electronics company in the 
late 1960s in 1988 the reagan administration suffered a defeat 
when the court ruled that washingtons plan to close down the un 
mission of the palestine liberation organization in new york 
violated international law

remember all that talk about pork rinds during 
last years campaign forget it about the only place you can find 
them in the white house is in a vending machine in the press area 
white house aides say the president rarely munches on pork rinds 
while working in the oval office in fact his favorite snack 
appears to be popcorn 
and while jelly beans used to reign supreme in the reagan white 
house these are days of candy wars in the top corridors of power at 
the white house 
chief of staff john sununu keeps a full bowl of licorice outside 
his office it serves as the same social gathering point for staff 
members as water coolers do in other offices 
a rival bowl of confections candycoated chocolate mampms sits 
outside the oval office and has its own flock of devotees 
last week a minor rebellion erupted after some unidentified 
but healthconscious staffer replaced the mampms outside the 
presidents office with what may have looked like pork rinds at 
first glance but that turned out to be oat bran cereal 
the oat bran went nearly untouched the crowd grew bigger at 
sununus licorice bowl 
after a few days of protest the dietary experiment was halted 
the mampms are back 
meanwhile pork rinds while scarce at the white house are 
regularly put out in bushs cabin aboard air force one 
the president and the staff that emulates him by jogging playing 
tennis and horseshoes and riding exercise bikes apparently devotes 
more time to exercise than nutrition 
sununu meanwhile is one who hasnt been caught up in the recent 
exercise binge his idea of exercise claim staff members is 
playing computer games particularly mathematical ones 
asked why he hadnt been swept up in the fitness craze the 
stocky sununu told a reporter hey listen i wish i had more 
time and i should probably have more discipline 
ive been playing a little basketball with the kids at home 
he added 
but he made it clear that you wont see him jogging alongside the 
president during bushs threeweek vacation in kennebunkport maine 
which begins today 
i think its great that the president can engage in such 
activities said his chief of staff i think it adds to his 
capacity

cardinal bernard law of boston a recent lunch guest at the white 
house was asked by reporters about bushs state of mind in the 
midst of the recent hostage crisis 
i think remarkably calm peaceful law said speaking on the 
driveway outside the white house 
i think the president is a very competent person and he 
listens hes interested he has the ability to ask pretty probing 
questions and i experienced all that during the course of the 
meal 
the cardinal went on to say he counts himself among bushs 
friends 
its a very good close warm relationship i feel as though 
if i have something that i wanted to discuss with the president that 
i could easily contact him 
he paused a moment then added i would hope that i would never 
abuse that because god knows i read someplace that hes got 10000 
very close personal friends 
when youre one among 10000 you dont want to overdo 
that

president bush says he wouldnt hesitate to use 
military force if he thought that would safely rescue the eight 
americans being held hostage in lebanon 
however the president said he didnt want to be responsible 
for the loss of innocent life 
but if i could find a way to take those hostages get them and 
bring them out and that required using the military force of the 
united states make no mistake about it i would do it in an 
instant bush said tuesday at his 21st formal news conference 
since taking office seven months ago 
bush stressed the uncertainties that involve any military 
response when asked why he had not retaliated for the murder of 
hostage marine lt col william r higgins 
bush who embarks today on a 20day vacation to his oceanfront 
retreat in kennebunkport maine again signaled that he is willing 
to work to improve the bitter usiranian relations of the last 
decade 
we dont have to be hostile with iran for the rest of our 
lives the president said weve had a good relationship with 
them in the past 
the first step he said is for the islamic republic to stop 
supporting terrorism and to pressure the lebanese kidnappers to 
release their american captives 
i think that if iran decided they wanted those hostages to come 
out of there there would be a good likelihood that that would 
happen 
noting conflicting signals from the new iranian leadership about 
rapprochement with the west bush said the jury is still out as to 
what has happened internally in iran 
he said he cant say the chances of a breakthrough on the 
hostages are closer today than three weeks ago but were going to 
keep on trying 
on another matter bush previewed the national antidrug strategy 
he and drug czar william j bennett will send to congress on sept 5 
the drug strategy will target all aspects of the problem 
including new efforts to cut off drugs at the source as well as 
tougher penalties for casual users bush said 
i think the day of tolerance for those who break the law in 
using drugs is over he said we are going to expand federal 
expenditures for the drug fight not by raising taxes but through 
some reallocation of resources 
bush gave no specifics but said his budget office was drawing up 
a list of programs from which funds could be diverted 
on other topics the president 
refused to rule out the possibility of abducting panamanian 
strongman manuel antonio noriega to face drugtrafficking charges 
i have an obligation to try to bring people to justice he said 
declared he was very comfortable with budget director 
richard darmans complaint that the federal reserve was keeping 
interest rates too high 
praised reps mickey leland dtexas and larkin smith rmiss 
killed in separate plane crashes as outstanding public servants 
who gave their lives trying to better the lot of mankind 
said that if sheik abdul karim obeid the shiite cleric seized 
last month by israeli commandos were indicted for the kidnapping of 
higgins i would be remiss if i didnt try to see him brought to 
trial 
suggested some kind of international effort to offer 
military assistance to countries that request help in eradicating 
drug production 
expressed the hope that the legal process can go on without 
a lot of hype against suspended state department diplomat felix 
bloch suspected of spying

federal engineers say they are stepping up 
their investigation into complaints that as many as 15 million 
nissan cars manufactured between 1982 and 1984 have a dangerous 
seating defect 
the national highway traffic safety administration said tuesday 
that it had received 96 complaints that the cars seat backs shifted 
backward suddenly and without warning 
the agency considers the allegations serious enough to upgrade a 
preliminary evaluation into an engineering analysis said spokesman 
tim hurd the change means engineers will study actual seat backs to 
determine whether they are defective as opposed to paperwork 
analysis 
nissan spokesman don spetner said the company was reviewing the 
decision and would have no immediate comment 
the nissan action was among several announced tuesday including 
new or upgraded investigations of models sold under the nameplates 
of ford mercury peugeot toyota hyundai bmw buick oldsmobile 
and pontiac and the closing of other investigations involving 
hyundai lincoln chevrolet and ford 
weve had large recalls of other cars for seatback failures 
hurd said of the nissan action its a hazard you can lose 
control of your car if the seat back suddenly fails 
complaints to nhtsa have blamed 22 accidents and 13 injuries on 
the alleged defect he said 
the agencys engineers are examining these nissan models 
manufactured during the 1982 1983 and 1984 model years maxima 
pulsar sentra stanza 200sx 300zx 510 and 720 
nhtsa also launched an investigation of 1987 and 1988 ford 
escorts and mercury lynxes after 13 complaints that safety belts had 
failed four injuries have been blamed on the belts alleged failure 
to restrain occupants during accidents hurd said 
also nhtsa granted a petition requesting an engineering analysis 
of the 1989 peugeot model 405 six complaints have been filed about 
malfunctions of the passive restraint system in 2200 cars hurd 
said 
the agency also reported opening preliminary investigations of 
stabilizer bar breakage in 400000 toyota tercels from model 
years 1982 through 1988 
passive restraint system problems in the 1987 hyundai excel 
rearbelt failure in the 1989 ford festiva

the chevrolet monte carlo the pontiac grand prix the oldsmobile 
cutlass and the buick regal 
front wheel drive steering column locking in 500000 chrysler 
cars with tilt steering wheels sold under chrysler plymouth and

the agency also raised several preliminary evaluations to the 
engineering analysis level one was a probe of 1064 buick lesabres 
oldsmobile 98s and pontiac bonnevilles from 1986 and 1987 in the 
wake of complaints about jammed brakes another involved safety belt 
failures in 6282 toyota land cruisers 
the agency reported discontinuing a probe into seatback failures 
in ford passenger cars made between 1983 and 1986 finding 
insufficient grounds to proceed

new york gov mario cuomo unsuccessful in a 
bid for federal approval to tear down the shoreham nuclear plant 
still insists the new plant on long island will not open 
no matter what their intent is theyre not going to be able to 
open this plant cuomo said tuesday after a nearly onehour 
meeting with president bush 
but deputy energy secretary w henson moore said the plan to tear 
down a completed nuclear power plant before it produces any 
commercial electricity was an upsidedown energy policy that 
defies any kind of logical description 
bush according to moore wants the shoreham plant mothballed 
so it can possibly be resurrected later 
i dont think anything was done to change the governors mind 
i dont think anything was done to change the presidents mind 
moore told reporters outside the white house after the meeting 
cuomo said the most productive part of the meeting is that the 
energy planners would get together sometime later to discuss 
energy policy the governor also said he will continue to pursue 
court challenges to the federal governments authority to intervene 
in the shoreham case 
cuomo declined to characterize bushs reaction to his 
presentation but said it was a positive sign that the president 
agreed to the meeting 
at issue is new yorks plan to dismantle the 55 billion 
shoreham plant as part of its agreement with the long island 
lighting co which would sell the plant to the state for 1 in 
exchange lilco gets guaranteed rate increases of about 5 percent 
for a decade 
although the deal has been approved by the state and lilco 
stockholders the us department of energy has said it will try to 
prevent the deal by opposing transfer of shorehams license 
the nuclear regulatory commission must approve the transfer and 
the energy department has tried to slow that process by asking the 
commission to order its own environmental review of the impact of 
closing shoreham and using alternative energy sources the energy 
department also wants the nrc to stop lilco from further reducing 
staff at the plant 
last week the energy department joined a lawsuit that challenges 
the shoreham shutdown on environmental grounds 
cuomo requested the meeting with bush after white house chief of 
staff john sununu said the plant should be mothballed put in 
storage in effect for a few years until long island residents 
realized they needed the power the plant would provide 
cuomo met tuesday with bush sununu moore and deputy chief of 
staff andrew card 
cuomo on a flight back to albany ny told reporters that 
henson moore is an old politician who doesnt write sentences he 
writes slogans they talk in slogans they really do and when 
they talk in sentences they get in trouble 
cuomo was referring to moores contention that shoreham could be 
operated by the long island power authority the state agency buying 
the plant under the agreement cuomo said state law prohibits the 
agency from operating a nuclear power plant 
cuomo argues that shoreham would be unsafe to operate because 
long island couldnt be evacuated in case of an accident but moore 
said the nrc has approved an evacuation plan for long island and 
that cuomo simply was personally opposed to opening the plant

the small business administration is 
overhauling its minority setaside program in response to the 
wedtech bribery and influencepeddling scandal 
the regulations issued tuesday and effective immediately put 
into effect legislation signed nine months ago by president reagan 
they are designed to minimize political influence on the agencys 
21yearold program under which companies owned by blacks 
hispanics asians indians and economically disadvantaged women are 
given preference in the awarding of government contracts 
among the changes 
the director of the program will be a career employee of the 
agency rather than a political appointee sba administrator susan 
engeleiter named erline patrick a former staff aide to the senate 
small business committee to the post 
the person in charge will not have to respond as much to the 
political pressures patrick said 
companies that misrepresent their status as minorityowned will 
be subject to stiffer penalties the maximum fine was increased from 
50000 to 500000 and the top jail term from five years to 10 
years 
for the first time competitive bidding is required among 
minorityowned companies for manufacturing contracts over 5 million 
and product and service contracts over 3 million 
the length of time a company may get special preference was 
lengthened from seven years to nine years but companies will be 
expected to derive a steadily decreasing percentage of their 
revenues from contracts awarded under the program 
owners of eligible companies must have net worth of less than 
250000 excluding equity in their home or business when they 
enter the program the old standard was 750000 including home or 
business equity 
the agency must rule on applications within 90 days 
patrick at a news conference said about 3000 companies 
participate she said the net worth requirement and the initiation 
of competitive bidding may discourage new participants but she said 
she hoped the deadline for decisions would boost participation 
when congress passed the law last year sen dale bumpers 
dark chairman of the senate small business committee said it was 
aimed at preventing the recurrence of wedtechtype scandals 
wedtech corp a south bronx military contractor was awarded 
more than 250 million in nobid contracts in just four years but 
became the subject of five different state and federal criminal 
investigations 
e robert wallach a san francisco lawyer and close friend of 
former us attorney general edwin meese was convicted earlier this 
month of illegally receiving 425000 from wedtech to influence 
government officials in the companys bids for contracts 
rep robert garcia dny faces trial next month on charges he 
and his wife illegally accepted cash and jewelry from wedtech

government experiments show that four fatty 
substances found in common ocean algae are strikingly active 
against the aids virus scientists say 
algae extracts protected cells of the human immune system against 
attack by the human immunodeficiency virus the virus that causes 
aids a team of scientists for the national cancer institute 
reported 
the substances called sulfolipids are structural components of 
membranes of chlorophyllcontaining cell components in many plants 
algae and microorganisms 
their viralfighting ability had not been known before and was 
discovered in the cancer institutes program to screen substances 
for potential aidsfighting ability 
the pure compounds were strikingly active with all four 
showing similar activity according to the report in tuesdays 
journal of the national cancer institute however the effectiveness 
varied according to which line of test cells was being used 
compounds with similar chemical structures gave no protection 
against the virus 
the test could not show how the sulfolipids protected against 
viral activity the report said 
the sulfolipids that we have identified represent an intriguing 
new structural class of potential aidsantiviral compounds the 
scientists wrote 
because of the urgency for identification and comparative 
clinical evaluation of new antiaids drugs the decision network 
committee of the national cancer institute has selected the 
sulfolipid class as a high priority for further preclinical 
investigation and for evaluation of feasibility as a candidate for 
clinical testing wrote the team 
so far only one drug zidovudine or azt has been shown to be 
effective against aids though some others can help fight diseases 
that result from aids

newspapers are being flooded with anonymous letters 
from an unusual source disgruntled gendarmes the military 
corpsmen who make up almost half of frances 200000 police officers 
government officials have replied by saying reforms will be 
proposed this fall and in the meantime the gendarmes should think 
about the soldiers duty not to air the militarys dirty laundry in 
public 
national and regional newspapers have received dozens of letters 
each purporting to speak for a large number of gendarmes who are 
unhappy about pay scales long hours and poor living conditions in 
barracks 
the 90000 gendarmes are responsible for police duties on most 
french highways and in rural areas although they also sometimes 
patrol in cities special squads fight terrorism monitor river 
traffic and patrol airports among other tasks 
the line between the duties of the gendarmerie and the national 
police is not always clear and leads to frequent conflict between 
the two bodies it occasionally leads to arrests of gendarmes by 
police or viceversa 
the gendarmerie traces its origins back centuries to the 
marechaussee medieval soldiers called to catch bandits and 
highwaymen it got its name and current status in 1791 at the 
height of the french revolution 
its a unique organization that exists in no other country in 
europe napoleon once said according to a history of the 
gendarmes its the most efficient way to maintain the tranquility 
of a country its a halfcivil halfmilitary surveillance 
spread over the entire territory 
gendarmes answer to the defense ministry they are trained paid 
and expected to work and live like soldiers while doing exactly the 
same tasks as police unlike police they cannot form unions and 
are not paid overtime 
speaking out publicly means certain disciplinary action under 
military rules 
an anonymous letter published in the regional daily ouestfrance 
complained about the 120 hours oncall each week including 60 to 
80 hours working no overtime pay or compensatory time off and no 
compensation for working weekends and holidays 
starting pay is 1135 monthly for the unmarried and pay 
increases on a sliding scale for those with families several 
letters said that once unpaid overtime is taken into account 
gendarmes barely get the minimum wage 
a letter published by the national daily francesoir from an 
anonymous gendarmes wife who signed herself madame x denounced 
the degradation of family life she said the gendarmerie makes 
life abominable for couples leading many of them to divorce 
married gendarmes live in apartments built into the barracks 
with widely varying amenities 
the first anonymous letters appeared in regional newspapers in 
eastern france in early august and only gradually attracted national 
attention soon there was a flood with the french news agency 
agence francepresse counting almost 20 over the weekend of aug 
1213 
gerard renon the junior minister in the defense ministry said 
in a television interview that the letters dealt with problems we 
know about and are working on 
other government officials said a proposal would be presented in 
the fall to redistribute the work force upgrade the barracks 
assure at least some free time to the gendarmes and possibly 
increase the number of draftees allowed to do their military service 
as auxiliary gendarmes 
the directorgeneral of the gendarmerie regis mourier issued a 
statement saying he was aware of the problems and was working on 
them 
meanwhile he said the gendarmes should keep quiet not just 
from respect for the obligations of the military status but from 
respect for the institution its history and its place in the 
nation mourier said 
the call to silence just unleashed more letters 
its not by telling us to shut up that the problems will be 
solved said an anonymous letter published in the daily le 
populaire du centre de limoges in central france watch out 
general officers and elected officials disgust and discontent is 
getting established in this good old marechaussee

the american museum of natural history has 
decided that three heads are better than one when it comes to 
dinosaurs 
the museum has revised its opinion of what the head of an 
apatosaurus commonly known as a brontosaurus looked like 
but because the museums 17foottall 66footlong apatosaurus 
skeleton was assembled in 1905 and contains bones that are 140 
million years old it was too fragile to withstand a head transplant 
so the museum has created an exhibit featuring three heads one 
is a copy of the head now on the apatosaurus skeleton another is a 
model that scientists now believe more closely resembles the 
apatosaurus real head and the third is the head of a close 
relative of the extinct beast 
we may have to change our minds again once we find a skeleton 
with a skull attached but we think this is the most likely guess 
based on the available evidence until we actually find a complete 
skeleton with a skull attached said lowell dingus exhibit 
coordinator 
no one has ever found an apatosaurus skeleton with a skull 
attached the skull created for the 1905 model skeleton was based on 
that of a dinosaur believed to be close kin a camarasaurus 
since then paleontologists have changed their minds about the 
apatosaurus likely relatives a paper published in 1978 argued that 
the diplodocus was a closer kin than the camarasaurus implying the 
apatosaurus had a longer sleeker head than had been believed 
when the museum tried to behead its apatosaurus in preparation 
for a new skull it sent vibrations down the skeleton and a couple 
of the ribs fell off and broke dingus said

the second explosion of a 
submarinelaunched trident 2 missile in five months could again 
delay navy plans to send its newest deadliest weapon on operational 
patrol 
the original december target was put off until march 1990 by the 
first failure now the march goal is in jeopardy 
one of the 44foot 237 million missiles exploded tuesday 
seconds after it was launched from the nuclear submarine tennessee 
while it cruised submerged about 200 miles southeast of cape 
canaveral 
the navy said the blowup caused no injuries nor did it damage the 
submarine or a nearby support ship 
officials said the problem occurred shortly after the missile 
cleared the surface and ignited reminiscent of the first trident 2 
submarine launch on march 21 that missile blew apart four seconds 
after it was launched by the crew of the tennessee 
investigators traced the problem in march to a mechanical linkage 
responsible for moving the rocket steering nozzles back and forth 
the faulty part was redesigned 
on aug 2 the tennessee launched a trident 2 with the design 
changes on the missiles first underwater success and navy hopes 
were buoyed 
there was no immediate indication whether the two failures were 
related and officials said they wont know exactly what went wrong 
tuesday until they study radio telemetry tapes of the missiles 
behavior 
there was no immediate assessment of what impact the latest 
failure will have on the trident 2 operational schedule the first 
failure set back the plan three months 
the navy had planned about six more underwater tests before 
sending the tennessee on operational patrol in march with 24 of the 
nucleartipped weapons nine trident 2 submarines are planned 
each missile is capable of propelling as many as 10 nuclear 
warheads to different targets more than 4600 miles away 
nineteen trident 2s were testfired from a land launch pad before 
sea trials began the navy rated 15 of them successful

a proposal to allow riverboat gambling 
passed in two iowa counties but a third county surprised some 
people by sinking the floating casinos plan by a wide margin 
voters in dubuque county the largest of the three counties 
approved the proposal by a 21 margin with about 25 percent of 
voters going to the polls 7793 or 66 percent voted yes and 3913 
or 33 percent disapproved 
the dubuque county vote was expected but allamakee countys 
rejection didnt seem to be in the cards some said because there 
was little organized opposition 
it was very quiet there were a couple of letters to the 
editor its surprising said deputy county auditor marian smith 
with 23 percent of eligible voters in the extreme northeast iowa 
country going to the polls 1099 turned down the measure and 645 
voted for it 
in clayton county with about 20 percent of voters going to the 
polls the measure narrowly passed 1122 to 1060 
it was hard to get an indication of what was going to happen 
there wasnt any organized opposition said robyn denning mayor 
of mcgregor in clayton county im just glad it passed 
terry harrmann chairman of dubuques riverboat referendum 
committee said he didnt expect a close vote 
dubuque is on the move harrmann said dubuque voters have 
seen fit to say lets move forward lets not rest on our 
laurels 
six more iowa counties along the mississippi river will hold 
special elections this month on the plan 
iowas new riverboat gambling law allows gambling on excursion 
boats beginning april 1 1991 in counties where voters first 
approve it by a majority vote in a referendum the legislature 
limited betting to 5 per play and set a 200 limit on losses 
boats can offer blackjack roulette slot machines dice games 
and video gambling 
the state racing and gaming commission will decide how many 
licenses to grant and where the boats will dock but that decision 
isnt expected until next year 
harrmann said the city council will select a possible site for a 
dock if dubuque acquires a license he said supporters have 
contacted three or four excursion boat operators to possibly operate 
a floating casino 
one of them is friedschegan and associates of san diego 
company president frank fried said were confident that 
dubuque county made the right decision and applaud their efforts

moines counties an aug 29 referendum is set for voters in scott 
jackson clinton and muscatine counties

the lebanese hostage crisis has 
increased anxieties in this community where residents pray for one 
of their own a soldier who according to news accounts may have 
died more than three years ago 
rachamim alsheikh 23 was captured on feb 17 1986 when shiite 
moslem extremists ambushed an israeli convoy 
since then there has been no word from alsheikh or yossi fink 
also 23 who was taken in the same attack 
recent reports have said they died of wounds shortly after their 
capture by the radical militia hezbollah or party of god 
a neighbor said the alsheikhs suffer in total silence seldom 
making their anguish public the family declined to be interviewed 
the alsheikh familys pain is felt by the entire community 
said the neighbor who spoke on condition of anonymity they are 
never alone there is always someone from the family or the 
neighborhood with them 
rosh haayin is a small town on the outskirts of tel aviv like 
the alsheikh family most of its residents are jewish immigrants 
from yemen 
the community never forgot alsheikhs capture but anxiety over 
it was heightened on july 28 when israeli commandos abducted a 
shiite moslem cleric reputed to be a leader of hezbollah in a raid 
in southern lebanon 
israel has offered to swap the cleric sheik abdul karim obeid 
and hundreds of shiite prisoners for an israeli navigator shot down 
over lebanon in 1986 alsheikh and fink and the 16 western hostages 
longest held is terry a anderson chief middle east correspondent 
of the ap abducted 4 years ago 
the sunday times of london said in an report last weekend 
however that obeids interrogators concluded the two infantrymen 
died of wounds shortly after the ambush the newspaper quoted 
unidentified senior sources in the israeli government 
israeli officials in an effort to reassure the families of the 
missing men said they assume the soldiers are alive unless there is 
conclusive proof to the contrary 
at a public prayer session monday in rosh haayins synagogue 
rachamim alsheikhs father shlomo tearfully recited psalms and 
prayers for his son and other missing israeli soldiers 
hundreds of the towns 13000 residents attended the service 
praying may be the only way to save our sons the elder 
alshiekh said 
rachamim alsheikh was captured while serving in the elite givati 
infantry brigade under a special arrangement for students who 
attended jewish seminaries he divided his mandatory military 
service between religious studies and combat duty 
yehiel zahavi 53 a factory worker who has lived across the 
street from the alsheikh house since 1950 described rachamim as a 
devout young man 
zahavi said rachamim attended a private orthodox grade school and 
then a seminary in a nearby town there are six other alsheikh 
children one of whom has devoted his life to religious studies 
zahavi said 
the owner of a neighborhood restaurant described rachamim as 
innocent about the world 
all men and women in israel which has a population of 42 
million are drafted into the military 
the abduction of obeid was portrayed by israeli leaders as an 
example of israels sacred principle that every effort be made 
to gain freedom for captured soldiers 
rosh haayin residents remain optimistic in the face of the 
conflicting reports about alsheikhs fate 
i served in the army and in all the wars zahavi said i 
know that the army always takes care of its boys never abandons 
them

a state agency said it was only 
concerned about the safety of residents when it tranquilized a bear 
that had ambled up a utility pole causing her to tumble to the 
ground in a shower of sparks 
the state department of game and fish was criticized tuesday for 
tranquilizing the bear atop the 25foot pole without first cutting 
electrical power or providing a safety net 
mark birkhauser a conservation officer with the department said 
he received nearly 30 calls tuesday after television and a local 
newspaper showed the bear falling from the pole contacting 
transformer coils that generated the spray of sparks then trailing 
smoke 25 feet to the ground 
the singed bear survived with a limp after the 7200volt shock 
and the fall officials said but that didnt deter callers 
weve received quite a bit of calls primarily criticism 
public opinion in general seems to think it wasnt handled as well 
as it could have been birkhauser said most of them would have 
liked to have seen us put a net under the pole or let the bear come 
back down off the pole on its own 
but birkhauser said public safety was the main concern 
to have put a net would have been difficult and not terribly 
smart he said that bear could have came back to and latched on 
to the person holding the net 
the main concerns of callers were that the bear was 
tranquilized while too high on the utility pole and no attempt was 
made to cushion its fall and that electrical power wasnt shut off 
before the animal was shot down said merrilyn segrest deputy 
supervisor at the animal humane association in albuquerque 
department officers shot the bear once on monday with a 
tranquilizer dart on a northeast heights rooftop then again after 
it reached the top of the utility pole 
the bear believed to be from the sandia mountains was taken to 
the rio grande zoological park where she is doing well officials 
said she sustained an electrical burn on her right hind leg 
the bear was believed to have been searching for her lost cub a 
6monthold cub was captured sunday in a mulberry tree in 
albuquerque the cub which was being held in the albuquerque zoo 
is fine birkhauser said 
its just scared and looking for mama he said

an international writers group that plans to meet 
next month in canada has decided against focusing on the case of 
british novelist salman rushdie according to an official 
graeme gibson president of the canadian center of the pen 
congress said that although the conference is titled the writer 
freedom and power rushdies predicament will not receive a great 
deal of attention 
rushdie author of the satanic verses has been in hiding in 
britain since feb 14 when the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
called on moslems to track down the author and kill him 
khomeini irans spiritual and political leader until his death 
in june said the novel blasphemed islam 
the pen congress an international group of poets playwrights 
editors essayists and novelists will hold its annual conference in 
toronto and montreal from sept 23 to oct 1 
gibson said the britishbased committee for the defense of salman 
rushdie asked that the conference not take up rushies situation 
its very hard to know what to do about it he said its 
certainly part of the territory for pen but there is nothing 
specific planned at this point 
there are others in far worse conditions than mr rushdie and 
in saying this im not minimizing his condition gibson said 
numerous nations that are predominantly moslem banned rushdies 
novel after critics said it associated the prophet mohammed with 
prostitutes and suggested that the koran islams holy book was the 
work of mohammed rather than allah 
some western nations pulled the novel from store shelves and 
dropped plans to publish it 
meanwhile in stockholm a swedish publisher said it will 
distribute the satanic verses starting friday and will release 
another book explaining islamic principles in two weeks 
carlotto bonnier vice chairman of the publishing house bonnier 
said the second book is titled islam our belief written by two 
moslem organizations and sponsored by the islamic information 
association in sweden 
it is not a polemic book it describes islam in a friendly 
way bonnier said tuesday adding that it explains criticisms of 
the satanic verses 
there was never a question of blackmail of any sort he said 
moslems in sweden want to feel they are getting an opportunity to 
make their voices heard 
but he also acknowledged the moslem groups had made it clear that 
publishing the book could prevent the kind of violence and protests 
that occurred in other countries over its publication

iran has begun a crackdown on a lucrative 
trade in smuggling persian rugs to evade strict controls on carpet 
exports 
last month authorities in southern bushehr province seized more 
than 750 silk rugs in what the official islamic republic news agency 
said was the biggest carpet haul so far the agency said the rugs 
were worth millions of dollars 
the rugs were hidden inside tanker trucks and would have been 
illegally shipped from a port on irans persian gulf coast irna 
said the agency was monitored in nicosia 
persian gulf merchants say most smuggled persian rugs are shipped 
across the gulf to the coast of the united arab emirates and trucked 
to warehouses in dubai the regions major trading center 
the crackdown on carpet smuggling from bushehr province started 
in july following similar campaigns against narcotics and arms 
smugglers 
it followed reports in irans staterun media that contraband 
carpet exports would soon outstrip legal sales abroad 
according to official statistics rug exports earned iran at 
least 260 million last year or more than onethird of its nonoil 
exports iranian newspapers estimated another 200 million worth 
were smuggled abroad 
silk rugs which cost five times as much as wool ones account 
for about 15 percent of carpets legally sold abroad 
dubai merchants say a trickle of legal exports provides the cover 
for a huge smuggling network with dealers flying in from japan and 
western europe to pick up bargains in persian carpets 
irans carpet industry used to employ more than 2 million people 
who spent the winter months weaving carpets in their villages 
but production fell sharply following the 1979 islamic revolution 
and the ouster of the monarchy political turmoil shut down major 
exporting firms and villagers from recessionhit weaving districts 
flocked to the cities to seek jobs 
soaring inflation meant that imports of fine wools and dyes 
needed for highquality carpets were sharply reduced it takes 
several years to weave a large carpet in a complex multicolored 
design 
in the revolutions early days carpet exports were banned on the 
grounds they were part of the nations store of wealth 
now customs officers value carpets before they can be shipped 
abroad and exporters have to hand over their foreign currency 
earnings to the government in exchange for iranian rials at an 
artificially low rate 
during the persian gulf war between iran and iraq dealers in the 
syrian capital of damascus stocked up on rugs sold by iranian 
tourists given governmentpaid trips to syria because their 
relatives had died as martyrs fighting iraq syria was irans 
main ally during the eightyear conflict 
the iranians would bring a small silk rug or two to sell in 
syria but after the ceasefire last year there arent nearly so 
many iranians visiting said nazir nahawndi a dealer in damascus 
cavernous hamadiye bazaar 
despite competition from lowerpriced rugs made in india china 
and turkey traditional persian rugs are still appreciated western 
european dealers say 
comparatively speaking persian carpets are selling for the 
equivalent of 1960s prices and they dont wear out unlike the 
new far east rugs firouz selmi an iranian merchant in frankfurt 
said in a telephone interview 
antique rugs some almost 100 years old are an investment that 
rates with anything else on the international art market he added 
a modern rug measuring 6 feet by 6 feet from a leading maker in 
the southern iranian city of isfahan a renowned carpet center can 
sell for upwards of 15000 at a london auction house 
in damascus rug merchants mostly buy from private homes as 
syrian families sell off the family heirlooms and switch to fitted 
carpets prices are considerably lower 
a goodquality shiraz rug measuring 10 feet by 6 feet costs less 
than 1500 a topquality throw rug in varied colors from kashan or 
in deep red with bold dark designs from bokhara costs about 2000 
prices are still reasonable because we get enough stock from 
the old houses but its a limited supply and it cant last that 
much longer said david hamedan whose family runs an antique 
store in the heart of the mazelike damascus bazaar

soldiers stormed a prison and killed 
convicts holding a religious group hostage after learning they had 
murdered male captives and raped the women the officer in charge of 
the jail said today 
all 16 convicts and five of the 15 hostages died before troops 
recaptured the jail tuesday in davao city 610 miles south of manila 
the dead included a 9yearold boy and australian missionary 
jacqueline hamill 36 of sydney one of the captives who was freed 
said miss hamill was raped at knifepoint the night before she was 
killed 
officials said most of the hostages were slain by their captors 
before the assault and that none of the captives died in the 
military attack 
but in canberra australias foreign minister said miss hamill 
may have been killed by soldiers when the convicts tried to break 
out of the jail hours before troops stormed it 
president corazon aquinos spokesman said there was no evidence 
the military bungled the hostage crisis but announced an 
investigation into the bloody incident 
lt col franco calida davao citys police commander and jail 
superintendent said civilian officials tried to negotiate with the 
inmates after they seized the hostages sunday during religious 
services at the prison 
a few hours before the attack the convicts had tried to escape 
by using hostages as shields during an exchange of gunfire one 
captive and one inmate were killed but five hostages escaped they 
told police of the rapes and killings calida told manila radio 
station dzxl 
when we learned that the women were raped and that male 
hostages were being killed the task was given to us calida said 
so the negotiating team was left with no other choice because the 
hostages were being killed one by one that is what the hostages 
were telling the negotiating team 
the attack began at about 3 pm troops rushed forward firing 
automatic weapons and secured the downtown jail after about 40 
minutes witnesses and officials said 
miss hamills body was found dumped outside the detention center 
with a bullet wound in the chest she had only been in davao city 
for a month 
the rev fred castillo one of the freed hostages said miss 
hamill and some of the nine other women hostages were raped other 
freed hostages said they heard the women screaming on monday night 
jackie told me about the incident castillo said tuesday 
in canberra foreign minister gareth evans said it appeared miss 
hamill may have been shot by a soldier during the escape attempt 
in the doctors opinion death was instantaneous and had 
occurred some hours previously which would indicate she had been 
shot during the attempted escape incident in the morning evans 
said in a report to the australian senate ms hamill was seen to 
slump as the group retreated back through a gateway to the inner 
compound 
evans said he had asked philippine officials to investigate her 
death 
in hobart australia miss hamills father ray hamill 
criticized both australian and philippine authorities for their 
handling of the crisis 
why the hell did they have to storm the prison he told the 
newspaper hobart mercury she gave her life to helping other 
people and now she has paid for it with her life 
presidential spokesman adolfo azcuna told reporters there 
appears to be no indication of mishandling the situation although we 
are examining exactly whether what they reported actually is what 
really happened whether or not the casualties could have been 
avoided and what can be done to avoid similar situations in the 
future

the security council condemned the bitter 
fighting in lebanon and called for an immediate truce and renewed 
mediation efforts by the arab league 
the councils 15 member nations unanimously passed the statement 
tuesday night after secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
invoked a rarely used power to convene a session when the council 
failed to act on its own 
the arab league ministers who have tried to mediate a peace 
settlement in lebanon also called for an immediate truce and 
denounced the intensified fighting 
france to get the council to act as soon as possible pushed for 
the security council to adopt a statement rather than a stronger 
binding resolution said diplomats who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
but minutes before midnight the security council passed a 
statement read by algerian ambassador hocine djoudi this months 
council president 
it said the council profoundly deplores the intensification of 
the shelling and bitter fighting in recent days 
it expresses its great disquiet at the loss of human lives and 
the untold suffering it causes to the lebanese people the 
statement said 
the council urgently appeals to all the parties to put an 
immediate end to all operations and to all firing and all shelling 
on land and at sea it further appeals to all parties to observe a 
total and immediate ceasefire when no council member was willing 
to call for a meeting on lebanon perez de cuellar invoked article 
99 of the un charter for the first time since he became 
secretarygeneral in 1982 
the article allows the secretarygeneral to call emergency 
meetings on any threat to international peace and security 
the secretarygeneral only had to resort to this twice before in 
the 44year history of the world body said un officials 
in 1960 secretarygeneral dag hammarskjold invoked article 99 to 
call a meeting on the congo crisis in 1979 secretarygeneral kurt 
waldheim used it to convene a meeting after iran took american 
hostages at the us embassy in tehran 
some diplomats said the fact that perez de cuellar had to invoke 
article 99 showed the security council had little hope for the 
situation in lebanon where christian troops are battling syrian 
forces and their lebanese moslem allies 
the councils statement said it supports an arab league committee 
that has tried to arrange a ceasefire and political settlement that 
would end lebanons 14yearold civil war 
the members of the leagues tripartite committee are king hassan 
ii of morocco king fahd bin abdulaziz al saud of saudi arabia and 
president chadli benjedid of algeria 
late tuesday night they they issued a statement that said they 
were saddened and profoundly moved by the recent evolution in 
lebanon marked by a significant deterioration in security without 
precedent the moroccan news agency map reported in a dispatch 
from rabat 
the leaders did not single out any party for blame in a 
statement aug 1 however the foreign ministers of their nations 
specifically condemned syrians actions and said their peace efforts 
had come to a dead end in both the political and security fields 
that was the second arab mediation effort to collapse this year 
and the diplomats said arab members of the security council were not 
eager to join in a declaration would make them responsible for a 
solution to lebanons problems 
the council may try to pass a resolution later in the week if the 
warring parties do not respond to the statement and to other 
diplomatic initiatives the diplomats said 
the permanent members of the security council are the united 
states soviet union britain france and china the current 
temporary members are algeria brazil canada colombia ethiopia 
finland malaysia nepal senegal and yugoslavia

anderson said tuesday he died from surgery complications 
as treasury secretary from 1957 to 1961 anderson was known as a 
conservative who put a higher priority on preserving the dollars 
value than cutting taxes or paying for additional outlays 
it was on his recommendation that eisenhower decided that the 
projected surplus for fiscal 1961 be used to pay off some of the 
national debt rather than cutting taxes

from the same harlem playground at about the 
same time of day on the same day of the week two toddlers who 
lived in the same apartment building vanished 
investigators now are distributing posters around the country of 
2yearold christopher dansby and 19monthold shane walker 
shane disappeared 5 pm thursday while christopher was last 
seen 7 pm on thursday may 18 
the two never played together but authorities say the 
disappearances may be linked because of the eerie similarities 
just before they vanished the toddlers were even playing with 
the same children 
the two playmates a 10yearold girl and her 5yearold brother 
cannot recall seeing anyone take the boys from the busy playground 
police said authorities have questioned them extensively 
no one that we have found yet has seen anybody with the child 
taking the child by the hand carrying it leading it taking it 
through a fence or leaving the playground said deputy chief 
ronald fenrich head of manhattan detectives 
he said two black men similar only in their dreadlock hair 
styles are being sought for questioning he declined to elaborate 
christopher and shane who both lived in the martin luther king 
jr towers housing project vanished from the developments large 
playground 
rosalee glover shanes mother said she and shane went to the 
playground about 5 pm she sat on a bench as shane played with the 
two children she said 
the kidnapping happened so fast she said i turned my head 
away when this guy asked me a question when she looked back 
shane was gone 
elizabeth manley christophers grandmother believes the two 
cases are connected in both cases the kids were taken right 
under our very noses she said 
manley said she too turned her head away for a minute at the 
playground and my grandchild was gone 
the national search includes rewards for the return of the 
children totaling about 30000 
police have searched the areas sewers roofs basements and air 
shafts of occupied and abandoned buildings but have found no signs 
of the boys 
the disappearances also have led investigators back to their 
files theyve reopened the cases of two other infants kidnapped in 
the area in the last two years one theory they have is that 
christopher and shane were taken as part of a conspiracy to steal or 
sell babies 
but the heads of two private adoption agencies in the city which 
place large numbers of black children with adoptive parents 
discounted that thought 
its hard to imagine said elaine rosenfeld executive 
director of the louise wise services there is a black market for 
white babies but for black babies i dont think so 
catherine unsino director of the adoption department at 
spencechapin said i have not heard of kidnapping any children 
of that age to satisfy the wishes of adoptive couples i cant 
picture the end result of a kidnapping being adoption 
she added people have used babies as fronts for illegal 
activities children are being sold for drugs 
detectives were looking at other theories as well including 
abduction by a pedophile an adult who has abnormal sexual desire 
for children or simply by a person who wished a child harm 
investigators had ruled out ransom as a motive saying no one had 
contacted the families for money 
were going over everything with a finetooth comb because we 
really have nothing to go on and just have to dig dig dig 
fenrich said

on the 20th anniversary of the deployment of british troops in the 
troubled province

states said a spokesman for the home office speaking anonymously 
in keeping with british custom 
it was a point that we wanted him out of the country as soon as 
possible and the raf had a plane available at about 5 am

1984 when he gave a speech endorsing violence one day after a 
soldier was killed in londonderry

in a lawsuit alaska accused exxon corp 
and six other oil companies of deliberate and gross negligence in 
not preventing and properly cleaning up the nations worst oil spill 
the lawsuit does not specify damages but could amount to 
billions of dollars a state official said tuesday 
the state alleges that exxon corp and exxon shipping co the 
subsidiary that owned the tanker exxon valdez are responsible for 
the tanker running aground by failing to staff it adequately and 
supervise the crew properly 
the lawsuit filed in state superior court at anchorage also 
says alyeska pipeline service co a consortium of oil companies 
that runs the transalaska oil pipeline failed to take prompt and 
adequate measures to contain and remove the spilled oil or prevent 
it from spreading into environmentally sensitive areas 
alyeska was in charge of the initial response to the spill 
the march 24 tanker disaster left nearly 11 million gallons of 
crude oil in prince william sound 
if you assume that the damages havent been half mitigated and 
then you add in any potential punitive damages this is probably in 
the multiple billions said robert leresche the state oilspill 
coordinator who announced the lawsuit at a news conference 
the lawsuit names alyeska and each of the consortium companies 
exxon pipeline co an exxon corp subsidiary arco pipeline co bp 
alaska pipelines inc mobil alaska pipeline co amerada hess 
pipeline corp phillips alaska pipeline corp and unocal pipeline 
co 
those companies controlled alyeskas budget to a degree that 
makes them responsible for alyeskas response to the spill the 
lawsuit says 
we feel that alyeska as a corporation was merely a sham a 
corporate shell if you will behind which these partners have been 
hiding for the last 12 or 15 years leresche said 
the lawsuit also charges that the oil companies misrepresented 
their ability to contain and clean up oil spills violated federal 
marine pilotage laws and inflicted severe emotional distress on 
alaska residents 
in a statement issued at its new york headquarters exxon said it 
had not seen the complaint but it appears to completely disregard 
the fact that exxons response to the accident has been massive and 
responsible 
our goal continues to be to leave the water and shorelines in 
an environmentally stable condition such that animals birds and 
fish are not harmed and no restrictions on commerical use or 
subsistence hunting and fishing are necessary exxon said 
the lawsuit seeks monetary damages for destruction of the 
environment and harm to the regions fisheriesbased economy 
the state recognizes that more than 1000 square miles of its 
lands waters and resources in or near prince william sound the 
kenai peninsula and kodiak island suffered severe environmental 
damage including the devastation of beaches and coastal waters the 
death or injury of thousands of animals the curtailment of 
important commercial fisheries and the impairment of recreational 
opportunities a state news release said 
the lawsuit seeks punitive damages its cleanup costs its costs 
of studying and monitoring the spill and a negligence fine under 
state law of up to 100 million the state also asks for an 
injunction to ensure exxon and alyeska continue the cleanup until 
the environment is restored 
leresche said he expected the lawsuit would take a decade to 
resolve

the attack and on dec 7 1941 genda was aboard one of the 
japanese carriers that launched the raid

times

estonia to consider ways to end a weeklong strike by russians 
complaining of discrimination in the baltic republic soviet media 
said 
the strike by tens of thousands of ethnic russians and other 
nonestonians is in response to a new law that limits the right to 
vote and hold office to longterm residents of the small republic 
the workers are also upset about a new law requiring many of them to 
learn to speak estonian 
the peoples front of estonia a prodemocracy group that also 
has been a moving force behind proestonian changes in the republic 
called for a national law guaranteeing the rights of minorities the 
labor newspaper trud reported today 
we will be living together for a long time and if the tension 
keeps increasing our lives and that of our children will be 
intolerable the groups statement said 
while estonian president arnold ruutel met in the kremlin with 
the ruling council of the soviet government a group of 
parliamentarians toured estonian factories and spoke with workers 
strike committee member mikhail lysenko said 
the legislators met tuesday night with the strike committee 
lysenko said in a telephone interview 
maarika saarna an editor with estonian state radio said from 
tallinn tuesday night that 26000 workers at about 40 enterprises

in the same district for two years or anywhere in the republic for 
five years candidates for elected office must live in the same 
place for five years or in estonia for 10 years 
staterun radio moscow said the law will take the right to vote 
away from more than 100000 recent nonestonian arrivals that was 
the aim of backers of the law who fear an influx of outsiders is 
making ethnic estonians a minority in their homeland

the 17yearold nephew of jailed businessman roger 
cooper offered today to take his place if iran would allow cooper to 
return to britain for his mothers funeral 
cooper 53 has been held in tehran as an alleged spy for nearly 
four years and his family and the british government have appealed 
to iran to let him attend the funeral on saturday 
simon cooper son of roger coopers brother paul cooper offered 
to go to iran as collateral for his uncle 
i am a little scared obviously because i have never been to 
iran but my father has been there three times he said on british 
broadcasting corp radio 
he has had no problems with the iranians they have treated him 
well i cannot see any reason why they would not treat me properly 
paul cooper said his sons offer was contained in an appeal he 
sent to iran 
if they wanted a surety that roger would return to jail since 
officially he is still a spy or is being held for who knows what i 
have said my son simon would be happy to go as surety paul 
cooper said on the bbc 
that was simons own proposal when we discussed the matter a 
couple of days ago 
he said the move was a personal initiative rather than one 
approved by the foreign office 
it is very important to us that roger is at his mothers 
funeral paul cooper said she is the woman who brought him into 
this world she has been a wonderful mother 
their mother dr rosaleen cooper died aug 3 
roger cooper who had lived in iran for more than 20 years was 
detained in november 1985 and formally charged with espionage one 
year later iranian officials have claimed that he also has been 
tried and sentenced but the sentence has not been disclosed

housing construction continued to rebound from 
the depressing effects of high mortgage rates with a 08 percent 
increase in new starts last month the government reported today 
this could mean more jobs in the construction and building 
materials industries and additional employment and sales in such 
housingrelated businesses as home furnishings and appliances 
the commerce department reported that new homes and apartments 
were built in july at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 143 
million units up from 142 million units in june when the rebound 
began 
the housing industry had been among the sectors hardest hit 
earlier this year as the federal reserve drove interest rates up to 
restrain economic growth and contain inflation 
construction starts had fallen for four consecutive months 
through may the longest string of declines since activity slowed 
for five months in a row from february through june 1987 the may 
level of 131 million units was the slowest pace since the 13 
million rate in december 1982 
but the central bank began nudging rates down in june and in 
anticipation of that move fixedrate mortgages began falling from 
their peak of 1122 percent in march the federal national mortgage 
association said fixed rates had dropped to 996 percent by last 
friday 
the july construction pace followed a hefty 85 percent hike in 
june the highest since a 86 percent jump to 151 million units in 
february 1988 
but junes increase reflected a 329 percent rise in the volatile 
apartment construction the highest since a 43 percent increase in 
april 1988 apartment construction last month fell 12 percent to an 
annual rate of 389000 units it had increased 54 percent in may 
after falling 266 percent in april 
construction of singlefamily homes in july rose 63 percent to 
an annual rate of 104 million units singlefamily starts had risen 
02 percent in june after falling 51 percent in may and 47 percent 
in april 
analysts had expected singlefamily construction to remain weak 
as the economy continued to slow causing a buildup in unsold new 
homes 
by region overall housing construction jumped by 16 percent last 
month in the northeast where starts rose to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 196000 units 
starts were up 11 percent to 272000 units in the midwest but 
fell 43 percent to 530000 units in the south and 42 percent to 
432000 units in the west 
applications for building permits a barometer of future 
multifamily housing activity were down 31 percent in july 
following a drop of 29 percent in june they had risen 1 percent in 
may and 85 percent in april after three consecutive monthly 
declines

us rep stephen solarz said today he 
hopes the united states can reach an agreement to keep its military 
bases in this country but he said washington will find other host 
nations if necessary 
the lease on the six military installations including the clark 
air base and subic bay naval base expires in 1991 many filipinos 
including lawmakers have said it should not be renewed 
solarz dnew york was scheduled to meet later today with 
president corazon aquino she has not stated her position on the 
issue 
if they come to the conclusion that it is to the best interest 
of the philippines to permit us to continue using the facilities 
then we will gladly and willingly continue to utilize them solarz 
said 
he added however that the american government would develop 
operative facilities elsewhere in case the philippines decides 
to close the bases 
solarz who is chairman of the asian and pacific affairs 
subcommittee in the house arrived in this country today with rep 
robert dornan rcalif and eni faleomavaega a legislator from 
american samoa 
in other comments to reporters solarz said singapores proposal 
to host some american forces was a constructive offer but not 
a substitute for the bases in the philippines 
singapore extended its offer earlier this month 
however defense minister tengku ahmad rithauddeen of neighboring 
malaysia said the proposal could jeopardize political stability in 
southeast asia 
some filipino opponents of the bases wary of the heavy american 
presence have suggested the facilities could instead be used for 
such things as commercial ship repair and industrial parks 
the philippines and united states are expected to begin talks 
this year on whether to extend the current agreement mrs aquino is 
expected to discuss the issue during a visit to the united states in 
november 
in october the two countries reached an agreement allowing the 
bases to remain until 1991 in return for 962 million in us 
military and economic aid over two years about 40000 american 
troops civilian workers and military dependents are stationed at 
the facilities

so on aug 8 the binns sued in broward county court 
i laugh about it but it really isnt a laughing matter said 
the binns lawyer benjie sperling you dont give up all your 
rights when you enter a condo entering and exiting a door is about 
as basic as you can get 
taking the shortcut is the natural thing to do said mrs 
binns she said the grass outside the door is thick green and looks 
fine 
the condo associations lawyer michael hyman said tuesday he 
had not yet reviewed the lawsuit

an iranian newspaper said today the united 
states can only improve ties with iran by condemning israel for 
acts of terrorism and releasing frozen iranian assets 
the same daily newspaper said tuesday that the release of iranian 
assets would not guarantee iranian help in freeing western hostages 
held by proiranian groups 
in an editorial today the kayhan international newspaper said 
president bush has shown substantial restraint on the hostage 
issue but that is not enough to improve ties between the nations 
the editorial reported by the official islamic republic news 
agency echoed a statement monday by an iranian leader ayatollah 
ali khamenei that there is no chance for talks between us and 
iranian leaders 
the united states can demonstrate its wisdom farsightedness 
and pragmatic approach just by taking two simple actions 1 condemn 
israel for its acts of terrorism and 2 release iranian assets 
kayhan said 
billions of dollars in iranian assets mostly undelivered 
military equipment were frozen in the united states after iranian 
extremists seized the us embassy in tehran in 1979 and took 52 
americans hostage the hostages were held 444 days 
there are 16 westerners including eight americans held hostage 
in lebanon most by proiranian shiite moslem factions 
bush said tuesday the iranians have it in their power to get 
american hostages released and rejoin the family of law abiding 
nations but he has said there can be no link between unfreezing 
iranian assets and releasing the hostages 
kayhan said tuesday that for bush to pin hopes on irans 
assistance to free the hostages without respecting tehrans 
conditions is wishful thinking it said the release of iranian 
assets in the united states would be taken only as a goodwill 
gesture not as a tradeoff for help in freeing the hostages 
the plight of the us hostages was pushed to the fore after 
israeli commandos july 28 kidnapped sheik abdul karim obeid a 
shiite moslem cleric from south lebanon israel said it wanted to 
trade him for the western hostages and three israeli soldiers held 
in lebanon 
in response a group called the organization of the oppressed on 
earth claimed it had hanged an american hostage marine lt col 
william r higgins another proiranian group threatened to kill 
another american hostage but later suspended the threat 
the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
in another development today the 17yearold nephew of jailed 
british businessman roger cooper offered to take his place if iran 
would allow cooper to return to britain for his mothers funeral 
cooper 53 has been held in tehran on spy charges for nearly 
four years and his family and the british government have appealed 
to iran to let him attend the funeral on saturday 
simon cooper son of roger coopers brother paul cooper offered 
to go to iran as collateral for his uncle

has more public support than the previous administration but its 
approval rating remains below 50 percent according to results of a 
poll released today 
the governing liberal democratic party has pinned its hopes for 
recovering its popularity on kaifu 58 who became prime minister 
aug 9 his predecessor sousuke uno resigned after only 69 days in 
office following the partys heavy losses in july 23 elections for 
the upper house of parliament 
kyodo news service said 465 percent of those responding to a 
poll conducted last week approved of kaifus new administration 
compared with 355 percent who supported the uno cabinet when it was 
formed on june 2 
fortythree percent of respondents said they disapproved of 
kaifus administration compared to 49 percent who opposed the uno 
cabinet it added 
it said the poll showed support for the conservative governing 
party rose 96 percentage points from june to 408 percent while 
support for the biggest victor in the elections the japan socialist 
party rose 53 percentage points to a record 338 percent

administration of takeo fukuda formed in november 1976 it said 
unos predecessor noboru takeshita began his administration 
with a support rating of 586 percent in november 1987 but that 
dropped to an alltime low of 39 percent in april of this year 
largely because of a stocktrading scandal that forced him to resign 
asked why they supported the kaifu administration the largest 
number of respondents 289 percent said there was no other 
appropriate person for the post kyodo said 
the main reason given for opposing the new government cited by 
337 percent of respondents was that it was backed by the liberal 
democratic party it said 
kyodo said 3000 eligible voters were contacted in the poll 
conducted aug 1112 and 1968 responded it did not provide a 
margin of error

federal taxes by charging about 4 million in personal expenses to 
helmsley businesses her husband harry 80 was previously ruled 
mentally incompetent to stand trial 
defense attorney gerald feffer has sought to show that the couple 
were entitled to bill helmsley businesses for expenses at their

entertain business associates

former personal assistant martin goldstein to the stand goldstein 
had also testified for the prosecution

of their time on the weekends working at dunnellen hall he said 
they read correspondence financial reports and other business 
documents

no he replied 
goldstein said he once presented harry helmsley with a stack of 
financial reports and told helmsley they might put him to sleep 
put me to sleep this is the most exciting reading i can get 
he said helmsley replied 
previous witnesses had portrayed mrs helmsley as an abusive boss 
who extorted kickbacks from liquor suppliers didnt pay her bills 
and forced suppliers to charge personal expenses to her business 
even her attorney conceded she was demanding and abrasive 
also tuesday us district judge john walker reserved decision 
on whether to admit an accounting report that feffer says shows the 
helmsleys are actually owed 681000 in tax refunds in 198385 the 
years charged in the indictment

earlier to me it is inexcusable and i cant understand why it 
didnt happen he said

mozambican rebel forces have issued a peace 
plan saying they would rather participate in elections than carry on 
their 12yearold battle to oust the government by force 
their 16point plan released in nairobi tuesday represented an 
answer to an earlier proposal by the mozambican government of 
president joaquim chissano 
the rebel plan said neither the rebels nor the government would 
gain from continued fighting 
it is not renamos intention to change the existing order in 
mozambique through armed force said the twopage document 
referring to the portuguese acronym for the rebel mozambique 
national resistance 
the armed struggle is just a last recourse in the defense of 
the people against the negation of their rights the twopage 
document said 
renamo has been fighting the marxistoriented government since 
mozambique gained independence from portugal in 1977 the war has 
killed an estimated 600000 people 
the rebel proposal followed a week of discussions that began aug 
8 in nairobi between renamo and a delegation of mozambican roman 
catholic and protestant church leaders 
during the talks the church officials presented a 12point peace 
plan from the mozambican government 
renamo leader afonso dhlakama said the rebel proposal was a 
response to chissanos offer which was never made public 
in its proposal renamo called for the withdrawal of foreign 
troops from the southeast african nation and urged genuine peace 
negotiations be held 
the united states and many other western countries have been 
providing nonmilitary aid to the mozambique government which 
continues to get the bulk of its arms from soviet bloc some western 
countries including britain and portugal provide some security 
assistance zimbabwe has large number of troops in mozambique 
helping the government fight the war 
chissano said recently he has accepted south africas word that 
it no longer aids the rebels however mozambique still believes the 
rebels receive help from nongovernmental groups in south africa 
renamos statement said the rebels want negotiations toward a 
national reconciliation without winners or losers that would 
finally end in peace 
renamos other proposals included a call for its own recognition 
as a political force an end to verbal attacks by chissanos 
government and general elections the guerrilla proposal also stated 
renamos opposition to human rights abuses 
renamo is a guerrilla force whose survival depends only on the 
people therefore it is by nature against any atrocity that risks 
the lives of the people its reason for being said the document 
the rebels have been accused of committing atrocities against 
civilians while seeking food or new recruits 
in an englishlanguage news release accompanying the proposal 
dhlakama said the church leaders and rebels addressed the withdrawal 
of foreign troops and possible ways of ending the conflict 
the closeddoor meetings between church leaders and rebels were 
held under kenyan government auspices 
the nairobi talks followed chissanos request to presidents 
daniel arap moi of kenya and robert mugabe of zimbabwe to mediate an 
end to conflict in the former portuguese colony 
mozambique is one of the worlds poorest countries an estimated 
6 million of its 15 million people receive food aid

palestinian activists in the occupied gaza strip 
today called for a twoweek boycott of jobs in israel to protest new 
computerized identity cards for day laborers 
the call came one day after leaflets distributed by activists in 
the occupied west bank also told day laborers there to strike for a 
week to protest the measure imposed on the gazans 
palestinians in the occupied territories were already in the 
second day of a separate general strike today shops offices and 
many schools remained closed for the strike which was called to 
mark a prison riot last year that left two palestinians dead 
the new strikes are to start friday when israel has said it will 
start enforcing the new identity card system an estimated 50000 
gazans and 60000 west bank arabs work in israel and play an 
important role in its economy 
on tuesday an israeli truck driver was charged with manslaughter 
and reckless driving in the deaths of four gaza arabs on dec 8 
1987 riots touched off by the traffic deaths are viewed as the 
beginning of the uprising 
in renewed violence today five palestinians were shot and 
wounded in stonethrowing clashes with israeli troops arab reports 
said 
slogans spraypainted on walls in the coastal gaza strip signed 
by leaders of the 20monthold uprising urged the day laborers to 
stay away from their jobs in israel to defy its efforts to control 
them by requiring the cards 
the government began to issue the computerized identity cards two 
months ago to try to control the movement of gaza day laborers the 
move came after the kidnapping and killing of an israeli soldier in 
the gaza strip and other attacks by gazans on jews inside israel 
cards are denied to anyone with a criminal record or who is 
considered a security risk 
the work boycott could result in a permanent loss of jobs for 
many of the palestinians israeli employers have been under growing 
pressure to replace palestinian workers with israelis both for 
security reasons and to reduce domestic unemployment 
earlier palestinian activists launched a campaign to sabotage 
the identity card operation urging palestinians to reject the cards 
the charges against the 29yearold israeli truck driver herzl 
bokovza were delayed for 20 months because of police investigations 
and a backlog in the courts justice ministry spokeswoman etty eshed 
said 
according to witnesses bokovzas truck collided with a car 
carrying gaza laborers from the jabaliya refugee camp killing all 
four arabs in the car 
rumors spread through the gaza strip that the truck had 
intentionally run over the workers and rioting broke out

trying to uncover heroin labs in the 1970s 
those were the hotbeds of activity in the french connection

youre dealing with someone in every respect who would be 
knowledgeable of everything coleman said 
obrien headed the deas springfield office from 1982 to 1988 and

four us air force jets came dangerously 
close to colliding with a spanish commercial jetliner carrying 50 
people an aviation official said today 
antonio yus the director of air traffic at zaragozas airport 
said the incident occurred the afternoon of aug 10 when the us 
a10a warthog jets were returning to the air base at zaragoza and 
the aviaco jet was approaching to land 
the air base and zaragoza airport share a landing strip 
the pilot of the dc9 saw the warthogs coming at him and had to 
climb at 60 degrees at 2000 feet per minute to avoid a crash yus 
said in an interview with the associated press 
the normal climbing speed is 500 feet per minute 
it was clearly a dangerous situation because neither the 
airline pilot nor air traffic controllers had been informed of the 
jets flight and they were not in contact with the tower yus 
said 
the american jets nato antitank aircraft normally stationed in 
west germany were at the zaragoza base to practice firing at nearby 
bardenas real training range he said 
a us air force spokesman lt cliff atkinson said the air 
force was preparing a statement on the incident

a principal who cut his own job so 
teachers would not be laid off is back at work after an outpouring 
of support from townspeople 
a cheer rattled the rafters of town hall after the school 
committee voted unanimously monday night to reinstate norman najimy 
the committee said it did not know where it would get the 43000 
to pay najimy who has been teaching for 37 years but members said 
they were bowing to the overwhelming desire of parents and others in 
the berkshire town of 1600 
four weeks earlier najimy whose country elementary school of 
200 pupils was cited for excellence by the us education 
department had suggested the board eliminate his job to protect 
teachers from sharp budget cuts 
the parents have been just wonderful and so have the senior 
citizens its a myth they dont care about the schools richmonds 
senior citizens were ready to make cash donations out of their own 
pockets najimy said tuesday 
if there is one lesson i have learned from all this it is that 
there are a lot of people in this country that believe in education 
and were eager for someone to speak out about reordering our 
national priorities 
najimy had received job offers from schools all over the country 
even gov michael s dukakis whose cuts in state aid have been 
blamed for much of the towns financial problems telephoned 
he asked if there was any way he could help get me back into 
the job najimy said i told him that my concern was not that 
but what we are going to do to preserve good schools

antiapartheid leaders today 
announced plans for a national conference aimed at unifying 
opposition to the government they called on foreign countries to 
ensure the meeting was not banned 
organizers of the historic conference on oct 7 include 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu black miners union leader cyril 
ramaphosa and albertina sisulu copresident of the banned united 
democratic front coalition 
the aim of the conference will be to map out the most 
effective shortest path to the ending of oppression and 
exploitation and the creation of a democratic country the 
organizers said in a statement 
we expect the conference to be attended by thousands of 
delegates from all walks of life representing millions of poeple 
a similar broadbased antiapartheid conference was scheduled to 
be held in cape town last year but was banned by the government 
predicting another ban this year the conference organizers said 
we are alerting the international community to monitor the actions 
of the regime in relation to this gathering of the people 
they said officials from the united states soviet union western 
europe and southern africa had been briefed about the conference to 
be held in johannesburg 
the current mood of our people is such that we believe they 
will defy any attempt by the state to prevent the conference from 
going ahead the organizers said 
they noted that a nationwide defiance campaign already was under 
way challenging various segregation laws as the sept 6 
parliamentary elections approach 
the organizers said any group would be welcome to join the 
conference which shared support for seven basic demands 
these were a oneperson onevote political system lifting of 
the state of emergency unconditional release of political 
prisoners unbanning of political organizations freedom of 
association and expression press freedom and a living wage for 
all workers 
the announcement made no mention of the forced resignation of 
pw botha this week and the appointment of fw de klerk leader of 
the governing national party as acting president 
de klerk has promised a fiveyear program to bring the black 
majority into the political structure but activists say his 
proposal is too vague and too slow 
the specific issue which triggered bothas split with his cabinet 
was the planned trip by de klerk on aug 28 to confer with zambias 
president kenneth kaunda a vehement critic of apartheid 
tom langley foreign affairs spokesman for the farright 
conservative party today described kaunda as an outspoken enemy 
of south africa and urged de klerk to call off the meeting 
if the meeting takes place langley said de klerk should give 
a public assurance that no internal affairs will be discussed 
langley said kaunda in effect would be representing the african 
national congress guerrilla movement which wages a bombing and 
sabotage campaign aimed at toppling the national party government

instrumental in trying to export irans islamic revolution to other 
moslem countries 
staterun tehran radio monitored in nicosia said 145 of the 243 
deputies at todays vote supported karrubi

portland maine press herald on the death of congressman mickey 
leland 
the death of rep mickey leland of texas while on a faminerelief 
trip tp ethiopia reminds us of the nobler side of politics 
congress is not held in particularly high esteem these days 
still many individual members of congress perhaps even most are 
highly principled dedicated hardworking public servants who are 
genuinely interested in serving the public good 
leland was one of them although not all of his colleagues or his 
constituents were captivated by his driving humanitarianism he was 
sometimes criticized for his obsession with bringing relief to the 
starving people of africa his detractors said he should have 
concentrated on the hungry people of the united states instead 
but leland had an answer for that i am as much a citizen of 
this world as i am of my country he said to hell with those 
people who are critical of what i am able to do to help save 
peoples lives i dont mean to sound hokey but i grew up on a 
christian ethic which says we are supposed to help the least of our 
brothers

st louis postdispatch on the death of congressman mickey leland 
mickey leland 44 died last week in the country that was birth 
to his mission as a politician 
the us representative from houston had always fought on behalf 
of people in need but in 1983 he toured ethiopia and was shaken by 
the desolation and deprivation he saw visited upon the people there 
when he returned to washington leland began his crusade to 
create a select committee on hunger that committee with leland 
at its head has been the conscience of the hill not just 
concerning famine relief for ethiopia but the plight of the poor in 
the united states 
the impetus behind the formation of the hunger committee was a 
trip to an ethopian refugee camp where a little girl died before 
his eyes from the hunger that consumed her it was on his fifth trip 
to such refugee camps that his plane crashed 
the tributes to him from president bush from house speaker 
thomas foley from activist jesse jackson go properly to one who in 
foleys words represented the best in compassion that we as a 
nation possess 
real tribute to mickey leland will come as such leaders work to 
ensure that a commitment to feed the hungry is always a top priority 
of this land of plenty

and world respect but given himself just a tremendous boost as our 
new leader seems to have hunkered down to threats against american 
hostages in the middle east 
he talks of long quiet diplomacy to get back some not all 
of our hostages 
this is wrong terribly wrong we cannot allow the remaining 
hostages most of whom knew the risks they were taking to stay in 
lebanon to handcuff our foreign policy nor can we allow our 
enemies to continue to kill americans with impunity 
we must not but we fear that is what is happening

the providence ri sunday journal on collin powell as jcs 
chairman 
if the senate concurs and there really isnt the slightest doubt 
that it will gen colin powell 52 will soon become the youngest 
man to be named chairman of the joint chiefs of staff as well as 
the first black ever to hold that powerful position 
president bush has chosen well 
not that the selection was all that surprising 
powell made his mark under the reagan administration so he is 
well known and highly respected by bush and the members of his 
national security team 
and so while the naming of powell will understandably be 
accorded added symbolic significance because he is black and 
relatively young this should not draw attention from the main 
point the nominee is eminently suited for the job

the arizona daily star tucson ariz on babies without brains 
in a civilized society doctors trying to save life cannot be 
allowed to profane the dying yet thats just what the medical 
community would do if it comes out on the wrong side of the debate 
involving brainabsent babies and organ transplants 
although the debate involves a small number of potential organ 
donors fewer than 200 brainabsent babies are born alive in the 
united states each year it has farreaching implications 
by the time an anencephalic baby dies usually within a few days 
of birth its organs often have deteriorated to the point that they 
are not usable for transplant purposes those who want to speed up 
the process by declaring living children dead and maintaining them 
on lifesupport systems until their organs are needed would do a 
terrible thing 
a disturbing report appeared recently in the new england journal 
of medicine authors argued that anencephalic babies are not alive 
and that doctors should therefore be allowed to ignore the usual 
standards of brain death in order to use such an infants organs 
earlier 
the suggestion is chilling 
what dr robert d truog of harvard medical school and 
bioethicist john c fletcher of the university of virginia propose 
is the creation of an artificially sustained class of everready 
organ donors 
currently most transplant centers will not traffic in 
anencephalic organs because such donors are not considered dead 
under standards set by either states or medical societies with 
todays technological advances however doctors have the ability to 
blur the fine line between life and death morality and immorality 
those who misuse brainabsent babies leap across that line 
the precedent such transplants would set would be devastating if 
doctors succeed in keeping brainabsent babies alive on machines 
until their organs are needed its not much of a jump for them to 
consider the same fate for comatose adults or anyone else the 
medical community has given up on

st cloud minn times on 900number phone calls 
the phone bill arrives its unusually high ah hah someones 
been making calls to those 900 numbers the ones promising all 
sorts of exciting messages 
unfortunately children comprise a big share of the market for 
services offered by a 900 number who else would respond to a sleazy 
television commercial advertising the chance to talk to mickey 
mouse the tooth fairy or horror movie king freddy krueger 
action for childrens television the national advocacy 
organization for quality young peoples programming has filed a 
petition with the federal trade commission demanding that atampt 
provide consumer safeguards on specialcharge 900 numbers 
the group wants the company forced to give refunds to parents who 
get surprise phone bills for 900 calls by their children at least 
the first one and requests atampt offer blocking of 900 calls on 
their phone line if requested they also want bills itemized to 
clearly indicate services directed to children aged 12 and under 
its a good theory on the surface 
and in reality its not feasible to expect one company which 
only provides the lines and billing for the information providers 
to excuse all bills claimed to be made by a child if that were the 
case a precedent would be set for erasing responsibility for what 
our children do it would also teach children the lesson that they 
can get away with irresponsible behavior because their parents will 
get them out of it 
temptations such as 900 recordings are here to stay and until 
blocking is available on all telephone companies large phone bills 
are a danger parents must teach their children to make responsible 
choices and take the consequences when they dont

the registerguard eugene ore on airline deregulation 
the current financial state of americas domestic airline 
industry can be summed up in four words profits up bargains down 
the relatively few airlines that made it through the 
postderegulation chaos are reporting record profits the good news 
for the industry however translates into bad news for travelers 
fares are up by more than 15 percent in the past year and 
discounts frequent flier programs and other enticements are 
fewer and more restrictive 
more disturbing however is the fact that only eight airlines 
united american delta northwest twa usair pan am and 
continental control more than 90 percent of the domestic market 
that concentration of market control is the antithesis of what 
deregulation was supposed to be all about 
the free market has worked and the fittest have survived but at 
what cost to those companies that died along the way and those 
cities that no longer have air service

herald times reporter manitowoctwo rivers wis on the atomic 
bomb 
almost without notice two significant anniversaries passed last 
week 
sunday was the 44th anniversary of the first atomic bomb attack 
on japan carried out by a us b29 bomber and wednesday was the 
same for the second and the worlds last nuclear attack to date 
it was aug 6 1945 that about 140000 people lost their lives 
in a firestorm that engulfed the japanese city of hiroshima three 
days later nearly half that amount lost their lives at nagasaki 
those two days did as much as anything in this century to change 
the course of the world while the attacks resulted in a swift end 
to the uss pacific involvement in world war ii it was the 
beginning of the atomic age the nuclear age and it was the 
beginning of awareness of the power of nuclear energy and the horror 
of it if used improperly 
every day the world lives in fear of a nuclear holocaust will it 
ever happen no one can know but the sheer thought of it should 
never leave the minds of those who are in global decisionmaking 
positions 
and just remembering hiroshima and nagasaki should make everyone 
strive for peace every day of their lives

the hutchinson kan news on the hud scandal 
not even solid conservative columnist james j kilpatrick can 
stand the stench seeping from the records of ronald reagans 
department of housing and urban development 
the more one learns of this rotten affair the worse it gets 
kilpatrick wrote in his nationally syndicated column a 
conservative view 
he called the scandal shameful and correctly put the blame 
squarely where it belongs ronald reagan and his handpicked aide 
samuel pierce did absolutely nothing in all those years to close 
the spigots of money going to those who were looting the treasury 
kilpatricks discovery of reaganesque incompetence is better late 
than never and it is a discovery that should be embraced promptly 
by others who have tolerated as merely unique a management style 
that was essentially a nonmanagement effort 
kilpatrick could go one step further in his assignation of blame 
and accountability beyond reagan and pierce the blame lies with 
those who embraced the virtues of illusions jokes and old movie 
scripts to take their minds off the difficult business of running a 
decent government

seattle postintelligencer on the embryo fight 
in londons observer in 1950 the british clergyman lord fisher

40 years later science continues to create such problems 
take the embryo imbroglio in tennessee there in a bizarre 
custody dispute a divorcing couple is arguing over control of what 
one lawyer has called the preborn children of their union 
the estranged wife mary sue davis had been unable to carry 
naturally fertilized embryos to term a fertility program at a 
knoxville hospital artificially fertilized eggs taken from the 
womans body with sperm of her now estranged husband junior lewis 
davis 
the result was nine fertilized human eggs two subsequently were 
implanted in the womans womb with no success then came the 
divorce and the dispute over the remaining seven fertilized eggs 
 
while we may not completely share fishers morose evaluation 
of scientific accomplishment we cannot debate his assertion that 
scientific progress has shoved us up against more and more 
complicated if not more difficult moral dilemmas progress has not 
only blessed us with the wonders of medical science but with its

flight 103 
president bushs decision to reverse himself and create a study 
commission on the flight 103 disaster was just plain common sense 
flight 103 exploded last dec 23 over lockerbie scotland 
killing 270 people 
among other things the commission will look into allegations 
that airline security was lax and that the lack of uniform 
counterterrorism policy increased the chances for such disaster 
families of the victims have questioned why the united states 
failed to make public the terrorist threats against the airline 
especially since some us officials abroad were advised against 
taking the flight 
its time to resolve the questions concerning the disaster and 
its time to separate fact from rumor its also time to look for 
better ways to protect air travelers the commission is the right 
way to achieve these goals 
bush was right to change his mind

port owners and dockworkers today 
refused to unload canadian toxic waste from a soviet freighter 
despite assurances from the environment minister that it poses no 
pollution or health risks 
the freighter nadezhda obukhova was carrying polychlorinated 
biphenyls or pcbs from montreal when it docked at liverpool 
northwest england the cargo was to have been sent to a special 
hightemperature incinerator in south wales 
but the mersey docks and harbor co refused to allow the pcbs to 
be unloaded and said the ship will return to canada after unloading 
other cargo 
earlier this month the tilbury port authority at the mouth of 
the river thames refused to handle a separate consignment of pcbs 
from canada and another soviet freighter had to take them back to 
montreal 
pcbs were used primarily as a coolant in electrical transformers 
but have been banned in north america because they have been linked 
with cancer 
regarding the ship in liverpool a dock company spokesman said 
the ship will be discharging and unloading other cargo and sailing 
tonight 
a dockers spokesman who also requested anonymity in keeping 
with british custom said we did not know how serious it was 
until it was brought to light recently and became a political 
football 
the liverpool ports refusal to handle the pcbs follows a wave of 
protests from residents of new inn wales where the rechem 
international ltd incinerator is located and from the greenpeace 
environmental group 
about 100 protestors greeted the ship when it arrived at the 
royal seaforth container terminal four hours later than scheduled 
because of bad weather in the irish sea 
the environment secretary chris patten said the liverpool 
dockers had no reason whatsoever to fear the cargo on 
environmental grounds 
he said government regulations tightened following a toxic waste 
controversy last year ensured the canadians pcbs were safe to 
handle 
there is no reason whatsoever why on environmental grounds 
these cargoes should not be handled he said after all the 
port has been handling these cargoes safely for some time 
rechem has a contract to dispose of a total of 13 consignments of 
wastes to be shipped from canada in the coming weeks company 
spokesman allan woods said its lawyers are studying the contract 
although rechem is not considering legal action at this stage 
rechem he said will defend our position 
canada has only one incinerator capable of disposing of pcbs it 
is located in alberta and does not accept wastes from other 
provinces 
britain tightened its regulations for accepting chemical wastes 
last year after a ship containing 2000 tons of toxic waste 
including pcbs was banned from docking the karin b a west german 
vessel was carrying italian wastes which had been illegally dumped 
in nigeria 
the wastes were ordered removed from the african country and were 
rejected by several european nations before being finally accepted 
back by italy

two minor parties today endorsed the idea 
of a coalition government led by the solidarity movement 
strengthening lech walesas bid to create the east blocs first 
noncommunist government 
the united peasant party and the democratic party which hold the 
balance of power in the polish legislature said they would back a 
solidarityled coalition 
we have entered a period of an open fight for power 
communist party leader mieczyslaw f rakowski told communist 
lawmakers today the situation is dangerous but it is not time to 
put up our hands in surrender the staterun pap news agency 
quoted him as saying 
a soviet diplomat expressed concern over the developments in 
poland but said moscow would not interfere 
the governing crisis that threatens to interrupt more than four 
decades of communist rule began with the partys crushing losses in 
june parliamentary elections the most democratic balloting in the 
country since world war ii 
huge gains made by the solidarityled opposition hampered 
communist efforts to form a coalition government 
on monday communist prime minister czeslaw kiszczak said he was 
prepared to resign and abandon efforts to assemble a cabinet in the 
face of solidaritys opposition to any communistled government 
kiszczak became prime minister 12 days ago 
on tuesday president wojciech jaruzelski proposed a meeting of 
the countrys main political leaders to find rational solutions 
but there was no word on when the meeting might take place 
solidarity has said that only an oppositionled government will 
have the public support needed to deal with a deteriorating economy 
and a 39 billion foreign debt 
the possibility that solidarity may lead a new polish government 
has worried polish communists and the soviets who fear the warsaw 
pact military alliance could be threatened 
a communist legislator who asked not to be identified said 
rakowski gave a very emotional speech today on the challenge to 
his party 
what can you expect after such a lack of diplomacy by 
solidarity he said nobody in the world wants to give up power 
and they want a government without communists they could have 
power but only by going step by step and not trying to turn it over 
all at once 
in a bid to ease soviet fears walesa the solidarity leader on 
tuesday promised that in any solidarityled government the communist 
party would be given control of the sensitive ministries of 
defense and interior that control the army and internal police 
it was possible communists could receive other ministries as 
well union spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz said today 
a soviet foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh said today 
that walesas statement was very sensible in regard to the 
following that poland is a member of the warsaw pact and solidarity 
should make the necessary conclusions as a result of that 
he said the soviet union was very much concerned about the 
polish situation but we dont interfere in the internal affairs 
of that country the polish people should decide themselves 
a polish communist official said the party will not take 
responsibility for the result if solidarity forms a coalition 
government that excludes the communists 
every thinking man should realize that we are not a state 
of parliamentary democracy yet party secretary slawomir wiatr was 
quoted as saying in the warsaw daily zycie warszawy having a 
parliament majority in itself is not sufficient to exercise power 
kiszczak on monday said he would turn over his unsuccessful 
attempt to form a grand coalition government to peasant party 
chairman roman malinowski 
but malinowski has not publicly said if he wants to be a 
candidate for prime minister and his own peasant party legislators 
declared after meeting with him today that they fully support lech 
walesas initiative 
in a resolution they urged party leaders to quickly realize 
the walesa coalition plan party spokesman jozef kowalczyk said 
kowalczyk declined to say what majority the resolution was 
supported by the 76 peasant lawmakers who make up the thirdlargest 
parliamentary delegation after the communists and solidarity 
malinowski returned to party headquarters to meet with party 
leaders he said 
meanwhile the 27member democratic party caucus also met and 
with only one negative vote adopted a resolution supporting the 
solidarityled coalition said their caucus leader jan janowski 
janowski said coalition talks with solidarity started last week 
and while there had been no decision on whom to propose as prime 
minister he understood the premier would come from solidarity the 
largest coalition partner 
deputy prime ministers would come from the two minor parties he 
said 
walesa said tuesday that he would serve as prime minister if 
society wishes it but he said that he would prefer someone else 
take the office

the leader of lebanons christian forces 
today welcomed a un call for an immediate ceasefire as syrian and 
allied moslem troops reportedly bolstered their forces outside the 
christian heartland 
the christian army commander gen michel aoun welcomes 
without any conditions the un security council resolution said 
an aoun spokesman who demanded anonymity 
the resolution as we understand it is a package deal that 
involves not just a ceasefire but also the lifting of blockades 
and planning the syrian military pullout from lebanon the 
spokesman added 
the spokesman did not elborate and it was unclear if aouns 
welcoming of the truce was tantamount to accepting it 
the un resolution made no direct references to syria or its 
blockade of the embattled christian enclave but it called on all 
the parties to put an immediate end to all operations and to all 
firing and shelling on land and at sea the resolution also called 
for the opening of the lines of communication and the lifting of 
the sieges 
there was little fighting in beirut today after heavy artillery 
battles on tuesday 
aouns statement was issued one day after the syrian army and 
moslem factions vowed to join forces to defeat the christians 
sources today reported a buildup of troops and ammunition around the 
christian heartland 
there was no reaction to the un ceasefire demand from syrian 
and moslem forces the 15nation security council had called for the 
truce during an emergency meeting ordered by secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar 
arab league ministers also renewed their call for an end to the 
fighting arab league committee members king hassan ii of morocco 
king fahd bin abdulaziz saud of saudi arabia and algerian president 
chadli benjedid called in a statement for an immediate and 
global ceasefire 
police said 19 people had been killed and 104 wounded in the 
fighting since tuesday when christian forces fought syrian troops 
with tanks and artillery along the southern eastern and northern 
edges of the christian enclave north of beirut 
syrian gunners also pounded the 28milelong christian coastline 
the only escape route for the areas residents 
by police count 760 people have been killed and 2050 wounded 
since the latest round of fighting in lebanons civil war began 
march 8 
since then shelling day and night has largely destroyed beirut 
and driven out 90 percent of the citys 15 million residents 
the fighting between the 20000 mostly christian troops under 
army aoun and syrias 40000 soldiers slackened early today to 
intermittent shelling 
but moslem security sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the syrians were reinforcing their troops opposite aouns lines 
in beirut the central mountains and northern lebanon 
one source said syrian trucks were observed early in the day 
bringing in troops and ammunition to positions facing aouns lines 
he said druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive socialist 
party and palestinian guerrilla groups from col saeed mousas 
fatahuprising bankrolled by syria also sent reinforcements to 
their positions in the wooded mountains southeast of beirut 
the buildup began after a sevenhour meeting in damascus of the 
heads of virtually all lebanons fractious moslem groups 
the syrians summoned their moslem and leftist lebanese militia 
leaders to damascus for a council of war in what appeared to be a 
move to escalate the campaign against the christians 
the leaders of 16 factions including iranianbacked shiite 
groups and radical palestinian guerrillas attended they issued a 
statement late tuesday saying they would close ranks to bring down 
aoun 
the solution must be on the basis of ending the israeli 
occupation and blowing up the sectarian regime from its roots it 
said but to bring down aoun is the priority as well as blowing 
up all the imaginary red lines 
the border of the christian enclave is often referred to as a 
red line that would provoke international intervention if 
crossed by syrian forces because it would represent a major 
escalation in the fighting 
syria has used its militia allies to do most of the ground 
fighting while syrian artillery and armor provide support giving 
damascus room for diplomatic maneuvering 
international pressure was building for a ceasefire 
pope john paul ii said tuesday from castelgondolfo italy in 
the name of god i turn to the syrian authorities asking them to 
stop the bombardment that aims to destroy the whole country 
perez de cuellar called the emergency un meeting when none of 
the security councils 15 member nations acted 
the un charter allows the secretarygeneral to call such 
meetings when international security appears in serious danger

the national association of black journalists 
gave its thumbs down awards for negative portrayals of blacks to 
nbc news and syndicated columnist patrick buchanan 
the nabj objected to what it said was the derisive tone and 
terminology used by nbc anchorman tom brokaw and reporter robert 
hager in a 1988 obituary on max robinson the first black network tv 
anchorman and a founder of nabj robinson died of aids 
in a letter to the network two nabj officials said brokaws 
introduction insinuated that mr robinson contracted aids in a 
decadent shameful fashion though there were no facts reported to 
support that presumption 
we reviewed our piece on max robinson and we remain convinced 
that it was fair and objective said peggy hubble speaking for 
nbc news 
buchanan got the dubious designation in the print category for a 
may 8 column calling for a coalition to liberate black america 
from a worse enemy than the klan ever was the black criminal 
buchanan wrote that if a young black or young white male 
sidles up to ask directions and one of the two is a robber rapist 
or killer the odds are at least 11to1 that it is the black male 
lisa dallos a spokeswoman for buchanan said tuesday that she 
would try to relay the news to him but he had not commented by 
today 
the thumbs down awards were issued tuesday and nabj was notifying 
recipients by letter 
mr buchanan uses too broad a brush to stereotype all black 
men said gayle pollard of the los angeles times nabj vice 
president for print 
crime is not a function of race it is a function of economic 
advantage or disadvantage said nabj president dewayne wickham of 
the gannett news service he said such depictions serve to fuel 
the engines of racism in this country

vice president dan quayle said today a new poll 
shows im off to a very good start even though it found that 
more than half the people surveyed thought he isnt qualified to be 
president 
the washington postabc news poll found nearly a 21 approval 
ratio for the way quayle is handling the vice presidency however 
52 percent of those questioned said he wasnt qualified to take over 
the presidency 
i am very delighted to see that by a ratio of 21 americans 
think i am doing a good job as vice president quayle said today 
at a photo session i feel im off to a very good start 
asked how he explained the 52 percent figure quayle said i 
tend to accentuate the positive and i have a very positive ratio of 
support with the american people of 21 on how i am doing the job 
they approve of the way i am doing the job thats good news for 
me 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater dismissed the 
polls findings we think the public does have confidence in the 
vice president he told reporters en route to miami with president 
bush 
fitzwater said bush thinks the vice president is doing an 
excellent job he has outstanding qualities in many areas asked 
whether he had faith in public opinion polls the spokesman said 
i never believe in the bad ones 
quayle talked about the poll as he posed for pictures with han 
xu who is returning to beijing after serving as ambassador to the 
united states 
quayle called it a final courtesy call and said the two would 
have a frank discussion 
clearly i will be giving him messages that he can take back to 
his government the vice president said 
david beckwith the vice presidents press secretary said quayle 
raised concerns about human rights and what china will have to do 
to improve its relations with the united states in the aftermath 
of the bloody crackdown on prodemocracy forces 
the poll on quayles performance was conducted by telephone with 
1022 people aug 48 about a year after george bush selected 
quayle as his running mate it showed little change from earlier 
polls that indicated a widespread lack of confidence in quayles 
qualifications to take over the government in an emergency 
fiftytwo percent said quayle wouldnt be qualified to take over 
as president thirtyeight percent said quayle is qualified to be 
president and the rest offered no opinion 
fortythree percent said bush should seect another running mate 
if he runs for reelection 
but the respondents had less trouble with quayle in his current 
job 43 percent approved of the way hes handling the vice 
presidency 22 percent disapproved and 34 percent said they didnt 
know 
the results were similar to national polls taken last spring that 
showed slightly more than half of those responding said quayle was 
not qualified to be president 
quayle told the post that his continued poor showing in polls is 
a result of last years campaign in which democrats attacked him as 
unprepared to step into the oval office 
i dont think people have the knowledge and information about 
me they do about the president quayle said 
white house chief of staff john sununu said bush was unconcerned 
with such poll results 
the president likes the job he is doing sununu said 
the results were sharply different for party members twothirds 
of those who said they were republicans approved of the job quayle 
is doing while only a third of the democrats approved 
the poll found 43 percent believe bush made a mistake in 
selecting quayle while 47 percent said it was not a mistake and the 
rest had no opinion 
the survey has a margin of error of 35 percentage points

speakers at a civil rights convention today 
stressed the need for black participation in both the republican and 
democratic parties and urged voters to watch for persecution of 
black elected officials 
we dont want our folks singled out said spiver gordon a 
commissioner in greene county ala said at the annual convention 
of the southern christian leadership conference we are concerned 
where there seems to be a special effort to prosecute 
africanamerican elected officials 
gordon a national sclc board member was convicted of vote fraud 
in a justice department probe of election irregularities in alabama 
but the conviction was overturned on appeal gordon had contended he 
was the victim of selective prosecution based on race a charge 
denied by the justice department 
emmanuel cleaver vice mayor of kansas city mo noted the 
absence of republican national committee chairman lee atwater after 
the bush administrations apparent courtship of black voters with 
tuesdays appearance of vice president dan quayle atwater had been 
scheduled to appear 
the republican party just has not offered the kind of 
sensitivity needed if we are going to participate cleaver said 
at the same time cleaver cautioned democrats not to assume 
blacks are satisfied with the party we have been bludgeoned 
politically by democrats he said he added it will be 
infinitely easier for blacks to progress in both parties 
civil rights leaders have been meeting with the bush 
administration over what they say is a trend toward overturning 
civil rights victories with supreme court rulings 
the group has said it intends to decide a course of action for 
reversing the assault on affirmative action and minority setaside 
programs the theme for this years conference is rebirth of 
hope in the struggle 
quayle on tuesday told participants that recent supreme court 
rulings against affirmative action and minority setasides do not 
reflect bushs attitude toward their cause 
the crowd of about 500 board members and staffers applauded him 
enthusiastically at times and seemed cool at others quayle said 
afterward he had no expectations going in there but felt good 
about the response 
i know there are concerns among you quayle said we will 
make america open and make america equal for all 
we may differ from time to time as to the course this nation 
must travel but we do not differ on the ultimate destination 
later quayle declined to comment on what those differences were 
civil rights leaders have said they are focusing upon the bush 
administrations actions not its words 
in introducing quayle sclc president joseph lowery urged bush to 
put some music behind the discussions 
let me take this opportunity to provide some music quayle 
said this president has in fact gone beyond the rhetoric 
yes we can do better and yes we will do better 
this is not rhetoric this is not politics this my friends 
is the right thing to do 
quayle referred to last weeks appointment of gen colin powell 
as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and said the sclc can 
rest assured we will not be deterred in reaching out to appoint 
blacks in the administration 
i feel confident we can work together and build an america we 
all envision quayle saidthere is no place for the klan 
neonazis skinheads or any other racist group in our country 
i was surprised to hear about some of the things he knew about 
the movement lowery had said after a recent meeting with quayle 
he was tossing out names and places and asking a lot of 
questions 
lowery was one of the few civil rights leaders to support the 
bush administrations failed nomination of william lucas as the 
nations top civil rights enforcer others had charged that the 
black republican lacked experience 
the nomination was killed two weeks ago in the senate judiciary 
committee bush subsequently appointed lucas to another position in 
the justice department that didnt require senate confirmation 
the convention which runs through friday is being held in 
atlanta for the first time since lowery took over the leadership in 
1977 
martin luther king jr with lowery and the revs ralph abernathy 
and fred shuttlesworth founded the sclc in 1957 in montgomery 
ala to carry on the movement started with bus boycotts in that 
city 
it has long been considered the grassroots arm of the movement 
working on issues such as homelessness unemployment and economic 
empowerment

time has erased most of the scars 
left along the mississippi gulf beachfronts by hurricane camille 
but for survivors the horrors of the 1969 killer are as vivid as 
yesterday 
we live with the memory of camille said civil defense 
director wade guice theres another camille out there somewhere 
and i just pray it doesnt come in here 
the most powerful storm in us history camille danced along the 
coast for days before roaring ashore in mississippi the night of 
aug 17 1969 camilles 200 mph winds smashed everything in its 
path and it unleashed a wall of water as high as 30 feet 
two hundred fortyeight people died including 141 in mississippi 
structures that had withstood major hurricanes of the past 
including betsy in 1965 vanished under camilles tidal wave large 
ships were tossed onto dry land with a 200foot barge coming to 
rest across what was left of us 90 at the time the major traffic 
artery along the coast 
i flew down there the next morning and it was incredible 
recalled us rep gv sonny montgomery dmiss i had seen 
total destruction in battle zones in europe and in vietnam but 
nothing like this 
there were no cars no people moving it was very 
frightening he said 
in the weeks following camille national guardsmen patrolled 
streets to prevent looting volunteers from across the country 
arrived to help remove debris and provide food and shelter for 
hundreds of homeless 
losses from the storm which also caused extensive damage along 
coastal louisiana and alabama and spawned scores of tornadoes 
inland was placed at 15 billion with most of the loss coming in 
mississippi guice said 
camille destroyed 6744 homes and damaged 46709 more while 
destroying or damaging 746 businesses 
harbor facilities have been rebuilt and the sand beach reclaimed 
over the years but there are reminders driveways leading to empty 
lots twisted aging trees and even a souvenir shop built next to a 
shrimp boat that rests near where it was blown ashore 
when a hurricane gets in the gulf you see people looking out 
over the mississippi sound wondering if another camille is 
coming said george byrd harbor master at the gulfport small 
craft harbor before that storm people always felt things wouldnt 
be as bad as the weather people were predicting well camille 
changed all that 
the storm left another calling card for shrimpers along the coast 
as receding waters sucked debris back into the gulf 
there were lots of shrimp out here after camille but you 
couldnt drag but about 10 minutes before you would have to pull the 
nets in to clean out the referigerators car batteries pilings and 
things like that said mike sevel who as a 16yearold at the 
time worked with his father aboard their shrimp boat 
we even had zippers on our nets so they could be opened 
quickly to dump the debris 
jacqueline hines and her husband had ridden out hurricanes for 
more than 50 years and saw no reason to abandon their beachfront 
home in gulfport despite the urging of friends and neighbors 
within a few hours the two were clinging for life 30 feet up a 
television antenna watching as gulf waters crushed their home and 
covered the twostory house next door 
how can one forget a night like that asked mrs hines 79 
everything we had things that can never be replaced are gone 
forever 
mrs hines recalls the violent wind that pinned her head back for 
hours the blinding flashes of lightning in a night with no stars or 
street lights and the hours she hung onto her unconscious husband 
in a sea of debris 
the two suffering broken ribs and other injuries were rescued 
the next morning 
there are so many stories of horror from that storm said 
guice who has headed harrison countys emergency agency for 28 
years there was the apartment complex where at least 24 people 
drowned during a hurricane party and an episcopal church built in 
1849 where 13 members of one family died 
i keep thinking about the loss of life if only those people 
had responded to our evacuation call

industrial production rose for the first time 
in three months in july while housing starts continued to rebound 
the government said wednesday in reports seen as further evidence a 
recession will be avoided this year 
the federal reserve said its industrial production index last 
month stood at 1417 percent of its 1977 base compared with 1414 
percent in june 
the 02 percent increase in july followed consecutive declines of 
01 percent in may and june overall production was up 27 percent 
over a year ago 
in another report the commerce department said housing starts 
rose 08 percent in july after posting declines for four consecutive 
months through may they started to rebound with an 85 percent 
increase in june 
at the same time the fed reported that the factory operating 
rate remained steady at 836 percent in july continuing to ease 
inflationary pressures 
its consistent with the softlanding scenario modest growth 
without tipping into a recession thomas holloway senior 
economist at the mortgage bankers association of america said of 
the reports 
david berson chief economist for the federal national mortgage 
association said that several months of stagnant production at 
manufacturing plants had been causing fears of a recession 
but wednesdays report indicates that manufacturing may have 
bottomed out and were seeing some moderate strength that should 
help with the softlanding scenario he said 
the fed has been walking a fine line between keeping interest 
rates high enough to cool inflationary pressures without slowing 
growth so much that the economy slides into a recession it began 
letting rates drop in june as inflation seemed to lessen 
the july gain mainly reflected a rebound in the output of total 
materials as well as continued strength in business equipment 
excluding motor vehicles the central bank said wednesday in 
releasing the industrial production report 
in contrast automobile and truck production fell sharply and 
output of construction supplies on balance remained weak it 
said 
production at manufacturing plants making both durable and 
nondurable goods rose 02 percent after remaining flat in may and 
june that was a 33 percent increase from july 1988 
output at mines and oil wells rose 03 percent following a 
revised 11 percent decline in june caused in part by a coal strike 
the july output was 35 percent lower than a year ago 
production at utilities reflecting increased use of air 
conditioning rose 08 percent in july following a 13 percent 
decline in june utility production was up 12 percent from july 
1988 
william d kelleher manager of the community resources section 
of the us chamber of commerce said he was encouraged by the 
housing report 
this months rebound in housing starts shows that the countrys 
economic expansion is continuing he said 
the july level of construction totaled 143 million units at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate up from 141 million in june 
singlefamily construction rose 63 percent last month while 
apartment starts fell 12 percent analysts said the multifamily 
drop was a natural falloff from an unusually steep 329 percent 
increase in june 
the operating rate at the nations factories remained at 836 
percent last month after declining 03 percentage point in june the 
fed reported the rate hit a 10year high of 843 percent last 
december last months operating rate was down from 837 percent a 
year earlier 
the closer us industry gets to full operating capacity the 
greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand leading 
to shortages and price increases analysts generally consider an 
operating rate of 85 percent or above as an indication of 
inflationary pressures 
the operating rate at manufacturing plants slipped 01 percentage 
point to 839 percent down from junes 84 percent that rate had 
peaked at 847 percent in january 
the rate at factories producing durable goods bigticket items 
expected to last more than three years edged down 03 percentage 
point from 826 percent in june the rate at factories producing 
nondurable goods rose to 862 percent compared with 861 percent 
in june

the government accused communist north 
korea on wednesday of using the border for propaganda purposes by 
allowing a student to return to south korea across the demilitarized 
zone after an illegal visit 
unification minister lee hongkoo said these provocative acts 
could endanger a truce on the korean peninsula 
im sukyong 20 was arrested when she crossed the border tuesday 
at the panmunjom peace village she had gone to north korea six 
weeks ago 
government officials said miss im was being questioned wednesday 
by the agency for national security planning at a hospital she was 
taken there for a medical checkup because she recently went on a 
fiveday hunger strike 
officials said she would be released from the hospital soon into 
the intelligence agencys custody the agency has said it intends to 
arrest everyone who participated in sponsoring or financing the trip 
south korea forbids unauthorized trips to north korea and insists 
that all dialogue on reunification be conducted through official 
channels the peninsula has been divided since 1945 
miss im went to the north for an international youth festival as 
a symbol of reunification and has said she returned across the 
heavily guarded border to dramatize the issue her supporters call 
her the flower of unification 
she crossed the border with the rev moon gyuhyun a roman 
catholic priest who traveled to north korea to escort her home 
they were arrested immediately the government has said they 
would be charged with violating security laws by making unauthorized 
trips to an enemy country and committing other acts against state 
dissidents and radical students said they would conduct a 
nationwide campaign against any punishment for miss im and moon 
newspapers and political columnists predicted the trip and its 
aftermath would accelerate the deterioration of relations and lead 
to another crackdown on dissent in south korea 
lee the unification minister said north korea committed an 
intentional provocation by permitting the crossing through 
panmunjom despite our repeated warnings 
the usled united nations command a signatory to the 1953 
armistice agreement that ended the threeyear korean war said a 
formal protest would be filed with north korea the un command and 
south korea say the crossing violated the agreement 
no peace treaty has been signed so the nations remain 
technically at war talks to reduce tensions have been held 
sporadically with little progress

wednesday to demand discussion about womens issues and other topics 
they said were getting short shrift 
about two dozen people attending the national conference on hiv 
infection and aids among racial and ethnic populations took over the 
stage during the main morning event and when the speaker finished 
commandeered the microphone 
im not getting what i need out of this conference diana 
diana executive director of the south carolina aids education 
network inc told the audience of several hundred i need 
information on drugs i need information on other peoples 
programs 
diana and others complained that womens issues including low 
representation in drugtesting trials werent being adequately 
addressed and that there wasnt enough opportunity for people 
actually running programs in communities to share their experiences 
with each other 
a man among the demonstrators said people like himself who have 
aids were being shortchanged by the lack of discussion about 
lifeprolonging treatments that are becoming available and about 
access to clinical trials in which new therapies are being tested 
im sorry we had to act up and im sorry that some of you 
dont like the fact that were acting up but some of us are 
fighting for our lives he said 
its platitudes empty rhetoric were hearing gail harris of 
the center for womens policy studies in washington explained after 
the demonstration that with much support from the audience 
disrupted the conference for about half an hour 
during the interruption a woman who had been translating into 
sign language for the deaf continued signing and often the audience 
broke in with enthusiastic applause for the protesters some of whom 
are members of the activist group aids coalition to unleash power 
known as act up 
at first some in the audience argued with the action of the 
demonstrators with one person in the audience calling the protest 
an act of incredible disrespect because the demonstrators began 
mobilizing at the front of the room while a native american was 
speaking from the podium 
but another person in the audience rose to say 
i think what theyre doing is encouraging there are too 
many of us that have felt a lot of anger and its about time someone 
did something 
another person in the audience drew hearty applause when she said 
we are letting ourselves be divided thats not what were 
here about we need to move on and work together 
the moderator of the session agreed to give the protesters five 
minutes which stretched to about 20 minutes for individuals among 
them to state their concerns 
the fourday conference which ends thursday is being sponsored 
by the department of health and human services 
jim brown a spokesman for the public health service which is 
part of hhs defended the agenda for the conference 
in putting together this conference we worked with all groups 
involved in the fight against aids about what should be 
discussed he said 
the list of sessions covers the complete spectrum from legal 
and discrimination issues to drug abuse helping people with aids 
volunteerism the whole spectrum

the second test flight of 
the 530 million b2 stealth bomber was cut short today by a low 
oilpressure reading the air force said 
the radarevading aircraft lifted off over the mojave desert at 
729 am for a three to fourhour flight but returned at 836 am 
because of minor concerns with its indicators said air force 
spokeswoman 1st lt anu sjaardema 
it was decided to land which is a normal procedure during any 
type of flight the crews were never in any danger she said 
we dont even know if its a problem yet were concerned with it 
and will have to check it out 
nevertheless we did achieve some of the things we set out to 
do so we cant say it wasnt a successful flight she said 
the black batwing bomber whose fate in being debated in 
congress flew with its landing gear retracted for the first time 
and also flew a little faster and higher than on its maiden flight 
in july although the air force wont specify the speed and 
altitude she said 
each of the b2s four engines has an accessory drive one out 
of the four drives indicated low oil pressure sjaardema said 
tech sgt donn clarius said the accessory drives power the 
engine turbine startup unit and hydraulic systems but there was no 
failure of the hydraulic system which on many planes allows pilots 
to operate flaps and other control surfaces 
the flight by northrop corp test pilot bruce j hinds and air 
force col richard couch came after a day of delays blamed on wind 
and a long list of preflight checklist 
during takeoff the plane climbed gradually and looked steady as 
it flew with the wind at its tail aircraft usually take off from 
here heading west into the wind 
during the planes july 17 maiden flight hinds and couch flew 
the b2 nearly two hours at up to 10000 feet the tailless 
172footlong wing with bulges in the middle was described by couch 
as a very nimble aircraft and a lot of fun to fly 
the air force had planned to fly the plane again after dawn 
tuesday but the test was rescheduled 
there was nothing wrong with the airplane said air force 
col don weisert a b2 deputy program director we expected winds 
to come up and we wanted to make sure we could get in a full day of 
activity 
the bomber the most expensive warplane in history was given a 
unique contour and built with radarabsorbing composite materials 
it is designed to carry nuclear bombs and with the conventional 
b1 replace the aging b52 bomber 
earlier this month the house voted to put strict limitations on 
production of the plane requiring the pentagon to come up with a 
cheaper program the senate made a modest cut of 300 million in the 
47 billion president bush is seeking 
the government has already invested about 224 billion in the 
b2 program which is 18 months behind schedule

a trail of popcorn led authorities to four 
young vandals who broke into a school trashed several rooms and 
tried to take the sting out of any future punishment by stealing the 
schools paddles 
the boys splattered finger paint tore up a bean bag chair and 
scattered its contents and poured bleach vinegar and cooking oil on 
floors 
they also spilled unpopped popcorn and that was their undoing 
sheriff ted montgomery said tuesday 
montgomery said a boy at cactus elementary school inquired the 
day before the burglary last week if there would be paddling during 
the upcoming school year 
he was told yes there would be the sheriff said part of 
the things that were missing were all of the paddles in the school 
authorities later found popcorn kernels around the home of the 
boy who had popped the corporal punishment question 
apparently the youngest one had gotten cooking oil all over 
him the sheriff said the popcorn had stuck to the youngest 
ones clothes 
school officials had no estimate of the damage 
the boys were turned over to their parents and the case was 
referred to juvenile authorities 
cactus is about 50 miles north of amarillo in the texas panhandle

mary ann gerlach remembers the approach of 
hurricane camille on aug 17 1969 was little more than an excuse 
for a party at her mississippi gulf coast apartment complex 
after all she had ridden out hurricanes before and a hurricane 
party was a good time to drink and play cards under the hurricane 
lamps 
but within hours the storms screaming 200 mph winds and wall of 
water claimed her husband and the two dozen people who had gathered 
on the third floor of the apartment complex for the party gerlach 
organized 
there were many stories of personal tragedy in camille including 
jacqueline hines who spent that night 20 years ago with her late 
husband clinging for life 30 feet up their television tower in 
gulfport as giant waves reduced their home to rubble 
gerlach said long hours at work before the storm saved her life 
i had worked the night before so we decided to take a nap in 
our secondfloor apartment and join the party on the third floor 
later not going up to that party is why im alive today 
within hours camilles strengthening wind had blown out their 
apartments windows and water from the nearby mississippi sound had 
reached waist deep in their bedroom 
we looked up at our ceiling and there were cracks in the walls 
you knew the third floor was fixing to come down right on top of 
us she said we swam out of the window and i immediately got 
tangled up in telephone lines 
gerlach said once she had freed herself she fought to swim away 
it was during that time i heard my husband hollering mary 
ann mary ann and then i didnt hear his voice any more i knew he 
had drowned but the shock didnt register she said 
as she grabbed onto debris and fought to keep her head above 
water i looked back and i could see the apartment house it just 
started sliding down into the water she said i will never 
forget seeing the hurricane lamps as they were still lit and 
disappearing under the water i knew all those people inside were 
gone 
gerlach was rescued the next morning on a pile of debris her 
husbands body was found in a treetop 11 days later gerlach is now 
serving a life sentence for murdering a later husband 
hines now 79 had experienced several hurricanes during her 51 
years living along the coast she rode out a major storm in 1947 and 
i just didnt believe camille could be any worse than that one 
despite warnings from friends the couple decided to stay to 
protect their home within a few hours it was too late to leave 
water eventually poured into their home and they were swept 
outside they clung to their 60foot television tower inching 
higher as waves broke over their heads 
all around it looked like we were in midocean the wind was 
so strong i couldnt hold my head up hines said 
the tower finally broke off sending the couple into the water 
and knocking her husband unconscious she managed to pull him to the 
roof of their house which was floating like a barge at the back 
of our property 
hours later the two were rescued and both were hospitalized for 
broken ribs and other injuries 
the first sunday leon was out of the hospital he went to his 
sunday school class at the first methodist church in gulfport and 
the class sang the hymn lord plant my feet on higher ground and 
dedicated it to him

californians want a bigger say in who 
becomes president of the united states and strongly support 
advancing the date of the states primary a poll found 
a california poll released tuesday found that residents favor 
moving up the primary now scheduled in june unless the move costs 
a lot of money 
democrats and republicans alike favor the proposal by 61 percent 
to 21 percent according to the poll 
but the estimated 40 million added expenses was a definite 
turnoff with only 14 percent backing such a plan when the estimate 
was included 
the last time california voters cast decisive votes in a 
presidential bid was in 1972 when george mcgovern beat hubert 
humphrey in the california primary to grab the demoratic nomination 
measures have been introduced in the legislature to move the 
primary to february march or april 
it would create at the top of the calendar an instant winnowing 
device for both parties and establish early on who are credible 
national candidates said michael mccurry a spokesman for the 
democratic national committee 
those who dislike the current primary system say the state has 
virtually no voice in selection of presidential nominees even 
though it sends the largest groups of delegates to party conventions 
the california poll was based on interviews with 754 registered 
voters and was conducted by telephone from july 12 to july 23 the 
results have a margin of error of plus or minus 37 percent

president bush today ruled out normalization of us 
relations with cuba unless president fidel castro installs more 
freedom for his own people 
in remarks at a fundraiser on behalf of republican congressional 
candidate ileana roslehtinen in a city long a magnet for cuban 
emigres bush said he will look for indications that castro will 
follow the moves toward openness now exhibited by his sovietbloc 
allies 
someday id like to see improved yes normalized relations 
with cuba but that cannot and it will not be as long as castro 
violates the human rights of his own people as long as he almost 
alone in the entire world now swims against the tide that is 
bringing sweeping change democracy and freedom to closed societies 
around the world he said 
as president i will look for signs that castro wants to move 
away from subverting his neighbors move toward more openness more 
freedom for his own people but until i see demonstrable change 
there will be no improvement in relations with cuba bush declared 
to warm applause it simply cannot be 
the united states severed relations with cuba in 1961 the two 
nations currently are represented in each others capital by 
interest sections rather than fullfledged embassies 
the president embarked on a threeweek maine vacation today by 
taking a roundabout route from washington to boost roslehtinens 
bid to succeed the late democratic rep claude pepper in a house 
district that includes many cubanamericans and other hispanics 
the cubanborn candidates campaign manager is bushs son jeb 
bushs trip to miami comes amid a bitter debate over justice 
department efforts to deport an anticastro cuban militant dr 
orlando bosch the justice department says secret us intelligence 
information implicates bosch in bombings and assassination attempts 
during castros 30year rule of cuba 
boschs supporters including roslehtinen view him as a hero in 
the battle against castro roslehtinen said she planned to ask the 
president to overrule the deportation order and sen connie mack 
rfla has requested a meeting with bush on the matter 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said however that 
the president could not address the case its a matter before the 
legal system and we cant comment on it he said 
bush called roslehtinen the kind of uncompromising 
experienced crimefighter we need in washington right now 
and in a district whose ethnic voting population is critical to 
campaign strategies bush said that roslehtinen has an increased 
sensitivity to the problems of all oppressed minorities wherever 
they may be 
he recounted a story about her grandfather who helped smuggle 
jewish refugees out of cuba wehn castros tyranny crushed freedom 
on the island 
the president was campaigning for the 37yearold educator as the 
gop eyed what it considers a golden opportunity to add to its 108 
majority in floridas congressional delegation 
pepper held the seat for the democrats from its inception until 
his death 27 years later may 30 at age 88 
roslehtinen will face gerald richman who won the democratic 
nomination in a heated runoff tuesday night in the aug 29 election 
bush was to travel to kennebunkport maine later today to spend 
the next 20 days at his family compound by the sea bushs staff 
said the maine trip would be mostly recreational with bushs family 
and friends on hand 
first lady barbara bush has spent most of the month there 
however bush is expecting visits from canadian prime minister 
brian mulroney and danish prime minister poul schluter 
the athletic president has spent past trips to kennebunkport in a 
whirl of golf tennis jogging swimming boating fishing and 
restauranthopping 
the florida race is one of several house special elections this 
year in which the democrats and republicans are sparring heatedly 
republicans hope to improve their standing of 175 members to 255 for 
the democrats with five vacancies 
the most recent vacancies were created by the deaths of texas 
democrat mickey leland and mississippi republican larkin smith they 
died in separate plane crashes 
roslehtinen whose resignation after seven years as a state 
legislator is effective aug 29 won the fourway race for gop 
nomination with 83 percent of the vote 
the democratic runoff was charged with ethnic innuendo 
richman a lawyer said repeatedly that the seat is an american 
seat his opponent was cubanborn rosario kennedy who came to the 
united states when she was 14

the internal revenue service says a tax notice 
sent to a 5yearold boy wasnt really a bill for 48000 and it 
wont seize his toys 
the agency apologized monday to vickie crowley and her son 
dustin but said a closer reading of the notice would have clarified 
the situation crowleys lawyer said she couldnt understand the 
irs letter either 
dustin was worried about the feds threat to take his property 
which consists of a big wheel bike and various toys 
they gave me a release of levy crowley said after talking to 
the irs monday that releases dustin of any levy and he said they 
wont come and get his big wheel 
irs spokesman jan hadley said dustin received a bill but not for 
48000 
she said the irs is trying to collect back taxes from a business 
that has gone bankrupt hadley declined to give the companys name 
but said that part of the effort to collect involves the irs sending 
bills to people who are shown on the companys records as owing it 
money 
dustin got the letter she said because the irs goofed 
we tried to send the letters out to parents and in this 
particular case we were unable to figure out who was the parent or 
the child she said 
but i can assure you that dustin is not responsible and if you 
read the letter it says that 
crowley said she had never heard of the company that supposedly 
counted the crowleys as creditors

juveniles held at the citys house of 
correction have been put in the same cellblock as adults and in at 
least one case in the same cell the philadelphia inquirer reported 
today 
prison officials disputed the report which the newspaper said 
was based on court records a retired prison chaplain and a source 
state and federal law allow juveniles who have been certified to 
stand trial as adults to be housed in an institution with adults 
but the practice may violate a philadelphia common pleas court 
consent decree requiring that juveniles at the house of correction 
be kept separate from adults there the newspaper said 
the inquirer said that according to prison records one day last 
month three adults were held in a part of the cellblock that prison 
officials said is for juveniles 
the records also showed that an adult was housed in the same cell 
as a juvenile who had been at the house of correction for one day 
that adult had been charged with aggravated assault and endangering 
the welfare of children 
prison officials said as many as 27 juveniles at a time have been 
held in a wing of the adult prison over the past nine months because 
of overcrowding at the citys youth detention center 
but maj thomas costello who oversees city juvenile facilities 
and maj wilhelmina speach a deputy warden at the house of 
correction told the inquirer that adults and juveniles have not 
been held in the same area

shipments of hard liquor fell last year to 
the lowest point since an industry survey began in 1970 a 
development attributed to americans new love of health and fear of 
addiction 
with only a few individual ups among the downs sales of 
distilled goods fell 42 percent last year to 159 million cases in 
1988 from 166 million cases in 1987 the trade publication impact 
reports in its current edition 
liquor sales last year were 25 percent below the 163 million 
cases shipped in 1970 the first year impact began its industrywide 
survey a case equals nine liters 
industry experts have blamed a variety of factors growing health 
consciousness the aging of the baby boom generation and the 
powerful campaigns in recent years against drunken driving and 
intoxication by alcohol and drugs 
in the late 1970s some in the industry hoped hard liquor sales 
would rise as the baby boom generation grew out of beer and wine 
instead distaste for drinking appears to be drying up sales of all 
alcoholic beverages 
total wine consumption in this country dropped to 5522 million 
gallons in 1988 down 287 million gallons or 49 percent from the 
previous year the industry publication wines amp vines reported last 
month 
beer sales too were flat registering a negligible rise to 24 
million cases in 1988 
impact blamed the decline in sales of distilled goods on the 
cumulative effects of federal state and local tax increases on 
spirits and the continuing pressure on the entire alcoholic beverage 
industry from antialcohol forces 
studies indicate consumers drink less as they age impact said 
distillers their profits drained by declining sales cut total 
advertising budgets last year by more than 100 million to 240 
million impact said 
makers of socalled white goods vodka gin rum and tequila 
could toast some sales gains 
vodka at 38 million cases distributed last year was reported 
the biggestselling distilled spirit in the country far ahead of 
the 21 million cases sold in 1970 gin ran a poor second in 1988 
with 14 million cases rum with 13 million cases in 1988 advanced 
7 million cases over 1970 
whiskeys took the biggest whipping a challenge distillers regard 
as extremely grim as they look for ways to recruit new customers to 
replace aging whiskey sippers its estimated people over 50 years 
old account for half the sales of whiskeys called brown goods 
in the trade 
sales in the whiskey segment including bourbon blends scotch 
canadian and irish declined 43 million cases to 60 million cases 
between 1970 and 1988 bourbon was the biggest loser dipping 19 
million cases from the 36 million figure in 1970 and skidding 63 
percent between 1987 and 1988 alone 
the biggest loser from 1987 to 1988 was scotch dipping by 88 
percent to 13 million cases 
but even as they spurn hard liquor drinkers demonstrate theres 
still commercial value in the snob appeal of a beverage like 
singlemalt scotch the leading singlemalt scotches glenlivet and 
glenfiddich advanced by 130000 and 75000 cases respectively 
between 1987 and 1988

in an ethnically tense battle to succeed the late 
rep claude pepper a lawyer won the democratic nomination on the 
theme that hes running for an american seat 
his cubanborn republican opponent called his victory ominous 
the winner was gerald richman a 47yearold former florida bar 
association president making his first run for office richman 
gathered much of his strength from a heavy majority of the diverse 
districts white nonhispanic voters in a 6139 percent victory over 
rosario kennedy 
richman moves on to an aug 29 special election against state 
sen ileana roslehtinen cubanborn as is ms kennedy for the seat 
left vacant by peppers death may 30 at age 88 
ms roslehtinen got a strong endorsement today from president 
bush who hastily arranged a side trip to florida before beginning a 
vacation in maine 
ileanas dream is your dream he told some 600 people at a 
fundraising luncheon its not a republican dream or a dade 
county dream its the american dream 
bush emphasized ms roslehtinens legislative experience and her 
tough stand on crime and drugs 
richman called his victory a victory for the community now is 
the time for democratic unity i cannot understand how being an 
american can possibly be divisive 
he said he will represent all the people not any one ethnic 
group 
with all of 146 precincts reporting unofficial returns richman 
had 14411 votes to 9226 votes for ms kennedy 
ms roslehtinen a sevenyear state legislator flew to 
washington tuesday and flew back to miami late this morning aboard 
air force one with bush who headed a list of speakers at the 
luncheon organizers said they raised at least 250000 for 
roslehtinens campaign 
i think the victory sends an ominous message that there are 
some voters who respond to an ethnically divisive campaign ms 
roslehtinen said 
republicans believe they have a strong shot at adding to their 
108 majority in floridas congressional delegation by winning the 
seat pepper held for democrats since its inception 27 years ago 
ms kennedy 44 in her concession speech called on richman to 
stop this divisive campaign and warned that an ethnic campaign 
can have claude peppers seat in jeopardy 
she said she would meet with richman today to discuss the general 
election campaign 
richman said though that he can defeat ms roslehtinen on 
issues such as abortion shes antiabortion hes for abortion 
rights and that he can unify the community 
she is in the rightwing extreme element of the republican 
party said richman 
were going to campaign by going to the people this is a 
grassroots campaign said richman who overcame ms kennedys 
support by party leaders the aflcio and the miami herald 
richman said his theme was meant to unify miami and to rebut 
republican national chairman lee atwaters statement that its time 
to elect the first cubanamerican to congress 
he thinks that lee atwater is his opponent ms roslehtinen 
said i condemned those words the moment they were uttered 
ms roslehtinen 37 said she will campaign on issues such as 
crime and drugs and holding down taxes 
i think voters are going to choose on issues and experience 
she said im certainly proud of my heritage but i dont campaign 
on that basis 
ms kennedy carried hispanic and black precincts tuesday but was 
defeated 4to1 in predominantly anglo or nonlatin white 
precincts 
richman jewish and brooklynborn stunned ms kennedy the 
democratic frontrunner with a latecharging 146vote victory in 
the aug 1 primary in which five other democrats were eliminated 
ms roslehtinen whose resignation as state legislator is 
effective aug 29 won the fourway race for gop nomination with 83 
percent of the vote her campaign manager is jeb bush the 
presidents son 
little difference on issues emerged between ms kennedy and 
richman in their runoff dominated by discussion of ethnic 
divisiveness qualifications and ability to defeat ms roslehtinen 
democrats are concerned that an increasing number of hispanic 
voters they now make up 40 to 50 percent of those registered 
will swing future elections to republicans 
richman supporters said he can best energize the vote in black 
neighborhoods and on miami beach to capitalize on the democrats 
continued registration advantage

the jury in the 6monthold night stalker 
murder trial resumed deliberations today after the foreman reported 
that panel had put behind them the slaying of a juror and the 
suicide of her boyfriend 
the night stalker defendant richard ramirez a drifter 
charged with 13 murders shouted out an objection and an obscenity 
when the judge indicated he would allow the panel to return to its 
task with an alternate member 
superior court judge michael tynan ignored ramirezs comment and 
rejected a defense request for at least a weeks delay in 
deliberations to allow jurors to recover from their grief there was 
no request for mistrial 
earlier the judge called into the courtroom the jury foreman and 
asked whether jurors were able to proceed in light of the slaying of 
phyllis singletary by her boyfriend 
i feel its somewhat tranquil said the foreman felipe 
rodriguez everyone appears to have put it behind them 
the judge then summoned all of the jurors and told them we 
must get on with the task that life has given us no matter how 
deepl 
the alternate who was chosen to replace ms singletary appeared 
upset when her name was called and sat trembling in her chair rather 
than moving into the jury box 
tynan said he understood the jurys emotions i think we have 
all been terribly affected 
but he said the killing was unrelated to the ramirez case and 
expressed the hope that panelists could complete their job 
i do not mean to be callous he said but we have business 
to do 
the judge said he would allow jurors to attend ms singletarys 
funeral arrangements if the services are in los angeles ms 
singletary a pacific bell employee is originally from el paso 
texas where her family lives

authorities gave permission wednesday 
for a tent community to shelter hundreds of east germans seeking to 
emigrate to the west while the international dispute surrounding 
them escalated 
east germany told a west german official that activities by 
bonns embassy in budapest violate international law 
bonn government spokesman herbert schmuelling said the east 
german foreign ministry called in franz bertele the head of west 
germanys permanent representation to lodge the protest 
schmuelling said it was rejected by bertele 
the tents approved by hungarian authorities are intended for use 
by some of the hundreds of east germans who left their makeshift 
camp outside the west german consulate tuesday and moved to a nearby 
roman catholic church 
a crush of passport and asylum requests by east germans has 
overwhelmed west german diplomats in this city and east berlin the 
embassy and consulate were closed in budapest monday and the west 
german mission shut down in east berlin on aug 8 
csilla von boeselager president of the hungarian maltese caritas 
humanitarian group said about 20 military tents would be set up 
thursday on a campground in a workingclass district in the pest 
part of budapest 
the tents sent with cots by the west german red cross can 
shelter up to 350 people the state news agency mti said 
some east germans began roundtheclock vigils outside the 
consulate last month in hopes of getting help to emigrate to west 
germany most have now illegally overstayed their visas to visit 
hungary 
bonn government officials said monday that 141 adults and 40 
children remained holed up inside the west german embassy despite 
the closure to the public they have demanded asylum in the compound 
hundreds more east germans are reported to have gone underground 
rather than return to their communist homeland some refugees say 
they fear persecution if they go home and others say they seek a 
better life in the west 
east germany and hungary are allies in the sovietled warsaw 
pact hungarian officials have privately acknowledged that east 
german attempts to use hungary as a springboard to the west are 
leading to tensions between their country and east germany 
officially hungary insists the affair is strictly between bonn 
and berlin but a west german diplomat said wednesday the hungarians 
are doing what they can to help the east germans efforts to 
emigrate 
the tent city ok comes officially from the mayor of budapest 
but its clear that the hungarian interior and foreign ministries 
were consulted said the diplomat speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the estimated 300 east germans who left the consulate crowded the 
lawns of a roman catholic church tuesday evening but mrs 
boeselager said hungarian families took in two thirds of them 
wednesday 
on wednesday many of those remaining at the church lined up at 
folding wooden tables as hungarian red cross volunteers doled out 
peas and pork some refugees ate sitting on the lawn while others 
filled out questionnaires given them by west german diplomats 
the refugees say the diplomats have been processing requests and 
handing out passports on church grounds 
several east germans say they will stay in hungary as long as it 
takes to gain passage to the west 
people at home are so bitter about the stagnation there said 
a 30year old woman while her two boys aged 6 and 3 crouched at 
her feet eating their food well do anything to make it over the 
border 
the wave of refugees developed in hungary after its liberal 
communist authorities removed border fences with austria in may 
hungarian border guards however have not let east germans pass 
with papers obtained in budapest

managers of a maryland nuclear plant that has 
been called one of the nations worst ignored warnings as long ago 
as three years that complacency was jeopardizing safety the owners 
chief executive told federal regulators wednesday 
george mcgowan chairman of baltimore gas amp electric co said he 
had told supervisors at the calvert cliffs plant on chesapeake bay 
that he saw a slippage setting in that threatened the plants 
reputation for efficiency and safety 
im not so sure they believed what i had to say mcgowan told 
members of the nuclear regulatory commission which last december 
declared calvert cliffs one of the worstrun plants in the country 
and stepped up monitoring of its operations 
the commissioners called in mcgowan and the utilitys other top 
officers to explain how calvert cliffs had fallen to the bottom of 
the performance pile after long being touted as one of the bestrun 
and most efficient plants in the nation 
the plants sudden fall from grace has raised new questions about 
the nrcs ability to detect drops in plant performance levels before 
serious accidents occur 
both of calvert cliffs nuclear reactors were shut down last may 
because of mechanical problems a series of earlier mishaps at the 
plant culminated in the accidental death last september of an 
employee who drowned in a water storage tank 
we recognize we have problems major problems mcgowan told 
the commissioners the current state of affairs disturbs me 
deeply 
he and other utility officials said they were working on a broad 
strategy for improving operations including methods of ensuring 
stricter adherence to safety procedures and strengthening plant 
management

israel has made clear it does not want to 
intervene in lebanon but is quietly reminding the syrians of limits 
to how far they can expand their battle with the christians without 
risking retaliation 
the warnings have been contained in hints by some officials and 
repeated public statements calling for worldwide pressure on syria 
to stop the 5monthold battle 
uzi landau a legislator from prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc said tuesday the israelis would warn syria 
in a quiet way about red lines that cannot be crossed 
that same day israels air force sent a warning to palestinian 
guerrillas some of whom are allied with syria by buzzing guerrilla 
positions near sidon in south lebanon 
reporters asked shamir on wednesday whether israel would put 
limits on syrian military action in lebanon he replied without 
elaboration there are red lines the red line is the safety of 
israel 
israel has long made clear that its strongest territorial defense 
line is drawn at sidon and the awali river the river is 25 miles 
north of the border 
the government also insists the syrians not threaten israelis 
freedom to fly reconnaissance over lebanon or its ability to patrol 
the southern lebanese coast to block guerrilla attacks by sea 
most statements by officials have castigated the united nations 
for failing to stop or condemn syrias bombardment of civilians in 
beirut which israel also shelled relentlessly during a 70day siege 
in 1982 
we were sorry to see that the un security council was not 
ready to do anything of any significance said foreign minister 
moshe arens the syrians think they can act in this brutal manner 
contrary to all the norms and laws of civilized society 
at a meeting called by secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
the security council approved an appeal tuesday night for a 
ceasefire in the syrianchristian artillery battle that began five 
months ago 
analysts say they believe syria understands how far it can go 
but also pointed to changes in strategy israel would consider a 
threat 
mark heller a middle east expert at tel aviv universitys jaffee 
center for strategic studies said a syrian ground buildup could be 
dangerous for israel even if it did not encroach on south lebanon 
if they bring large formations air defense systems are part of 
these formations he said and israel would fear that syrian 
missiles could interfere with its aerial surveillance 
syria now has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate from the arab league 
aharon levran a retired brigadier general and independent 
military analyst said syrian air defense batteries could gnaw 
away at israels freedom of action in the air 
he also said a syrian victory in lebanon that upset the balance 
of power might force israel to reconsider its nonintervention 
policy 
if syria ends up with the upper hand being victorious this 
will be a drastic change in the strategic situation in lebanon he 
said 
levran added however that he did not believe president hafez 
assad of syria would risk possible retaliation from israel or from 
iraq which supplies arms to the christians 
assad does not want to annihilate the christians he said 
only to punish the christian army commander gen michel aoun for 
challenging his role as power broker in lebanon 
aoun describes the syrians as an occupation army and says he is 
fighting a war of liberation to drive them out 
what assad really wants is aouns head levran said 
he said involvement in lebanon has kept syria too busy to 
concentrate on israeli and its a blessing for israel that syria 
will be bogged down deeper and deeper in the lebanese mud 
israels unwillingness to intervene stems from its experiences in 
the 198285 invasion and occupation of lebanon 650 soldiers killed 
political disunity at home and harm to israels image abroad 
finance minister shimon peres head of the centerleft labor 
party said on television wednesday israel did not get out of 
lebanon in order to return there there is a place for being 
worried only if direct israeli interests are harmed

the capitals army of highpriced lawyers at 
least those not spending august playing golf somewhere was jolted 
by an edict from local government trash collectors this week stop 
using yellow legal pads 
the warning was intended to prepare local office workers for a 
sweeping new recycling law that goes into effect in the district of 
columbia on oct 1 and to discourage them from producing colored 
paper trash which many recycling firms dont want 
although yellow legal pads arent actually banned by the new law 
the order from joan rohlfs recycling coordinator for the 
metropolitan council of governments sent a chill through this town 
with the highest concentration of lawyers anywhere in the country 
more than 30000 of them or roughly one for every 22 residents 
does this portend the demise of the legal brief will there be 
fewer petitions to habeas the corpus will those friends of the 
court the amicus curiae be popping in less frequently to lend a 
helpful hand 
it means well have to use white legal pads i guess said 
michael horn a partner in the prestigious 240lawyer firm of 
covington amp burling 
yellow legal pads are suffering a decline in popularity among 
younger lawyers who prefer to use personal computers for their legal 
research and notekeeping horn said 
but us older fellows and gals are wedded to yellow legal pads 
im afraid he said my desk is littered with them right now 
arthur j rothkopf partner and chief spokesman for hogan amp 
hartson said the new law will mean headaches for landlords who 
must haul the trash away but not for lawyers 
well do things the way we always have rothkopf said 
therell always be yellow pads we lawyers cant live without 
them 
washington lawyer lawrence barcella a former assistant us 
attorney predicted that his colleagues will figure a way to pick 
at the law and get around it somehow possibly by using legal pads 
with a slightly different color such as beige or maybe mauve 
lawyers charge by the pound for paper whether its separated 
in piles for recycling or not barcella said theyll still 
figure out a way to make the law work for them 
the law signed by mayor marion barry in january is intended to 
help the district of columbia recycle more of the 720000 tons of 
trash it generates annually most of the citys solid wastes are 
burned in an incinerator or buried in a suburban virginia sanitary 
landfill that is expected to reach capacity in three years 
dc council member nadine p winter who sponsored the new law 
called washington a paper factory whose paper trash amounts to 
53 percent of the citys solid wastes compared with a national 
average of about 36 percent 
effective oct 1 according to ms rohlfs all paper trash 
newspapers magazines computer paper and office stationery must 
be collected separately for recycling keep the newspapers 
separate she said keep the computer paper separate keep out 
contaminants such as gum labels tape and seethrough envelopes and 
stop using yellow legal pads 
washington lawyer roslyn a mazer said crackdown on yellow legal 
pads might lead to a bright future for some of her colleagues 
many lawyers are frustrated gourmet ice cream salesmen 
baseball executives or proctologists she said the 
unavailability of the yellow legal pad will enable them to embark on 
fully satisfying careers

the governing partys youth wing on 
wednesday protested singapores proposal to allow us military 
bases on its territory 
singapores offer made earlier this month was seen as a move to 
encourage the philippines to extend the lease on american bases 
there the philippines asked other countries in the region to share 
some of the burden of having us bases 
five officials of the youth wing of malaysias governing united 
malays national organization gave their note to the singapore 
diplomats at that countrys embassy 
however the youth officials and about 20 supporters made no move 
to protest at the us embassy across the street 
the note accused singapore of ignoring the concerns of its 
neighbors we know it is singapores sovereign right to do as she 
wants but how will she like it if malaysia invites the soviet union 
to site bases in this country 
some members of the group said they ignored the us embassy 
because the proposal came from singapore and washington has not 
said it would accept it 
malaysian leaders including prime minister mahathir mohamad 
also have criticized singapore for making the proposal if accepted 
they said it could destabilize the region 
singapore diplomats declined comment on the youth groups 
criticism saying only that the note would be sent to their 
government 
the tensions stem from the opposition of many filipinos 
including lawmakers to extend the lease of the six american 
installations there they include the stategically important clark 
air base and subic bay naval base 
rep stephen solarz dny who is touring the philippines said 
singapores offer was helpful and that washington was also eager to 
keep its bases in the philippines 
he said however if philippine opponents of the bases win their 
battle to block leasing of the bases beyond 1991 washington will 
find other host countries for them 
if they come to the conclusion that it is to the best interest 
of the philippines to permit us to continue using the facilities 
then we will gladly and willingly continue to utilize them he 
said 
he added that the united states would develop operative 
facilities elsewhere in case the philippines decides to close the 
bases 
solarz chairman of the asian and pacific affairs subcommittee 
arrived in manila wednesday with rep robert dornan rcalif and 
eni faleomavaega a legislator from american samoa he met briefly 
with president corazon aquino but did not say what was discussed 
mrs aquino has not stated her position on extending the base 
agreement 
the philippines and united states are expected to begin talks 
this year on whether to extend the agreement despite growing 
antiamerican sentiment mrs aquino is expected to discuss the 
issue during a visit to the united states in november 
in october 1988 the two countries reached an agreement allowing 
the bases to remain until 1991 in return for 962 million in us 
military and economic aid over two years about 40000 american 
troops civilian workers and military dependents are stationed at 
the facilities

influential post of parliament speaker a radical antiwestern cleric 
who advocates the spread of the islamic revolution 
the selection of hojatoleslam mehdi karrubi was seen as a blow to 
the new president hashemi rafsanjani whose socalled pragmatist 
faction favors rebuilding relations with the west 
parliament has to approve all the presidents cabinet 
appointments as the overseer of the 270seat parliament karrubi 
could make or break legislation and curb rafsanjanis policies 
staterun tehran radio monitored in nicosia said karrubi won 145 
votes among the 243 members of the parliament called the majlis 
who attended the session wednesday 
rafsanjani 54 had been speaker since 1980 but gave up the post 
after his election to the presidency july 28 he had pushed for 
former interior minister ali akbar nateqnouri to succeed him 
during his time as speaker rafsanjani built the speakership into 
a key role 
karrubi a 51yearold middleranking cleric has been a member 
of the majlis since march 1981 and was elected deputy speaker under 
rafsanjani last year 
he is a revolutionary hardliner who frequently was imprisoned 
for his clandestine activities during the reign of the late shah 
mohammad reza pahlavi 
he is allied with rafsanjanis political rivals led by the 
radical interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
karrubi also was close to the late revolutionary leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who named him head of the martyrs 
foundation a vast conglomerate that controls more than 700 
enterprises in iran 
as head of irans pilgrimage bureau karrubi was wellplaced to 
oversee covert operations in the drive to export the islamic 
revolution 
in 1986 iranian revolutionary guards posing as pilgrims tried to 
smuggle explosives and weapons into saudi arabia during the annual 
pilgrimage to islams holiest shrines in mecca most were arrested 
and deported 
the following year karrubi led militant iranian pilgrims to 
mecca where saudi troops were called in to quell political rioting 
allegedly instigated by the iranians more than 400 pilgrims most 
of them iranians were killed 
this year karrubi told demonstrators in tehran the 1987 riots 
were a calculated plot designed by american and israeli advisers 
to prevent the spread of the islamic revoution to other parts of the 
world 
karrubis brother hassan was involved with rafsanjani in secret 
armsforhostages negotiations in 1985 with thenus national 
security adviser robert mcfarlane 
rafsanjani is expected to take the oath of office thursday he 
takes over the presidency from ayatollah ali khamenei who was

the pilot of a plane carrying rep larkin 
smith appeared nervous and even ran the aircraft off a taxiway 
shortly before takeoff officials investigating the fatal crash said 
wednesday 
the cessna 177 veered east from its anticipated flight path 
before slamming into a 70foot pine tree in the desoto national 
forest sunday night killed were pilot chuck vierling 58 and 
smith a 45yearold freshman republican 
people who saw vierling before takeoff said he appeared to be 
kind of nervous like he was concerned about the flight said 
jorge prellezo regional director for the national transportation 
safety board in miami 
people at the hattiesburg airport observed the aircraft taxing 
out and said it ran off the paved taxiway area and into the grass 
then back onto the paved area which is kind of strange prellezo 
said in a telephone interview 
the two were returning from hattiesburg to their homes in 
gulfport about 70 miles to the south the plane wreckage was found 
monday scattered through tall pines and dense underbrush about 14 
miles south of new augusta 
william dowden an employee of southeast aviation watched 
vierlings singleengine plane both during and after takeoff 
he taxied straight out off the ramp area onto the grass and 
when he realized what had happened he made a 180degree turn then 
taxied slowly out to the runway dowden said the taxiways are 
lit up with blue lights and what happened struck us as being highly 
unusual 
prellezo said there were other questions about the first minutes 
of the flight including why the pilot told controllers that he 
would follow the established route along us 49 but instead flew 
about nine miles to the east over the desoto national forest 
we will look at every aspect to see why he deviated prellezo 
said 
while the investigation into the crash continues residents of 
the mississippi gulf coast where smith once served as sheriff 
began filing by the congressmans flagdraped casket on wednesday a 
funeral mass was scheduled for thursday

bishop karl lehmann chairman of the west german bishops 
conference also called the nazi massacre of the jews 
unparalleled in human history 
on sept 1 1939 adolf hitlers troops attacked poland touching 
off the worldwide conflict that killed more than 50 million people 
during their 12year dictatorship the nazis also killed an 
estimated 6 million jews 
in his message lehmann said later generations are not 
responsible for what happened under the nazis 
but that alone doesnt take care of the question of guilt and 
its causes he wrote all in fact are affected by the common 
heritage and must carry along this heavy burden in solidarity 
and whats more all are responsible for what will become of 
our people in the future the 53yearold bishop wrote in his 
message distributed to the news media 
he blamed the outbreak of the war on the nazi leaders 
megalomania third thirst for power and their criminal 
contempt of mankind 
the bishop also called on west germans to be on guard against 
movements that lead to hatred the country has been seeing 
increasing support for the extreme right which has blamed 
foreigners for many of the nations troubles 
lehmann also singled out the sufferings of the jews under the 
nazis 
hitlers profound hatred of jewish fellow human beings and of 
certain minorities determined his actions the bishop said the 
genocide of the jews is unparalleled in human history 
west germany has been the scene of a debate sparked by some 
conservative historians who argue that the nazi killings of the jews 
should be compared to other atrocities in history some west germans 
contend those historians are trying to diminish the horror of the 
holocaust

after seven years of silence britain and 
argentina on wednesday began talks aimed at normalizing diplomatic 
and trade relations that were severed after the 1982 falklands war 
britains un ambassador sir crispin tickell met lucio garcia 
del solar directorgeneral of argentinas foreign ministry to 
seek to establish the conditions and agenda for direct talks 
between the united kingdom and argentina according to britains 
un mission 
the mission said the meetings will be without prejudice to the 
sovereignty positions of either side regarding the falkland 
islands 
the talks opened wednesday but no details on the times and 
locations were disclosed an official communique is expected after 
they conclude thursday 
although the dialogue is not taking place under un auspices 
it is an encouraging development that secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar welcomes said his spokesman francois giuliani 
argentinas new president carlos saul menem made the dialogue 
possible when he dropped his countrys insistence that argentinas 
claim to the islands it calls the malvinas be the first step in any 
talks 
a meeting between british and argentine government officials in 
bern switzerland in july 1984 broke down when argentina raised the 
sovereignty issue as a precondition 
in april 1982 argentina invaded the islands where 2000 people 
of british descent live britain counterattacked and defeated 
argentina in a sixweek war that cost nearly 1000 lives 
britain cut ties with argentina and has said it will never 
negotiate sovereignty of the islands where the population has 
expressed almost unanimous preference for continuing their colonial 
relationship with britain 
argentina and britain have held indirect talks through the united 
states on such issues as fish conservation 
menems government would like to recover fishing rights in the 
area around the falklands britain currently enforces a 150mile 
exclusion zone steering argentine vessels away from the area 
many nations fish in the areas just outside the exclusion zone 
largely unregulated and britain and argentina would like to reach 
an accord on regulating fishing in the south atlantic 
both countries have lifted bans on importing each others 
products with buenos aires taking the step this month britain 
lifted its ban in 1985 
diplomats said argentina is also looking ahead to the unified 
european community in 1992 and realizes it must mend fences with 
britain which will be one of the major members of the new 
euromarket the largest trade bloc in the world 
the falkland islands are 300 miles east of the strait of magellan 
a british explorer sighted them in 1592 and britons landed on 
them in 1690 they have been under british rule since 1833 but 
argentina claims it inherited the land when it declared independence 
from spain in 1810

afghanistans defense minister on 
wednesday accused the united states and pakistan of organizing a 
major guerrilla offensive to overthrow kabuls marxist government 
defense minister shah nawaz tanai in an unusual interview with 
western reporters also said fighting in the 11yearold civil war 
had died down across most of the country in recent months despite 
what he described as newer heavier and more sophisticated us 
arms provided to the guerrillas 
tanai also said the moslem guerrillas fighting to overthrow the 
sovietbacked government of president najib were feuding among 
themselves and could never be united under a single command 
asked about reports of a new guerrilla offensive he said on 
the basis of information acquired from different sources the 
americans pakistanis and saudis are making strenuous efforts to 
amass a huge force from among all opposition groups to launch a 
major offensive with the hope of a military victory 
he did not say when he expected it to begin or provide any other 
details however 
im also of the opinion that the problems of afghanistan should 
be settled through peaceful means and there is no possibility of 
the military solution of the problem tanai said 
he added that the soviet union was ready to stop supplying 
weapons to afghanistan if the united states pakistan and saudi 
arabia halted arms shipments to the guerrillas 
the united states and the soviet union have accused each other of 
escalating the arms race in this povertystricken nation of 10 
million people 
washington says the soviets have nearly doubled their weapons 
shipments to kabul since they pulled their last troops from 
afghanistan in february it says the soviets are providing up to 3 
billion in weapons annually 
last week afghanistan said the soviets had begun to supplying 
mig29 fighters and the latest sukhoi27 groundattack jets 
washington has promised the guerrillas new weapons to attack 
airport runways and counter highaltitude bombing attacks by the 
afghan air force 
despite the reported arms shipments tanai said there had been an 
overall reduction in fighting by the guerrillas except in provinces 
bordering pakistan the seven most powerful guerrilla groups are 
based there 
tanai also said that since the soviet pullout leaders of the 
pakistanibased guerrillas who formed an interim 
governmentinexile have lost much of their control over guerrilla 
field commanders 
he said they were becoming increasingly isolated because of their 
growing identification with foreign powers 
i am of the opinion opposition groups can never have a regular 
organization and they can never be used under a single command 
this is the result of the shattering blows of the armed forces 
which led to severe differences among them he said 
though reputed to be a hardliner the general said he supported 
najibs policy of bringing all warring factions into a broadbased 
coalition and creating a neutral demilitarized afghanistan 
he said the afghan government has confounded western predictions 
it would fall quickly without soviet troops 
the armed forces proved in the last six months that they 
can independently and alone eliminate the opposition groups inside 
the country he said

the communist party is appealing to the patriotism 
of the chinese people as it tries to reestablish its moral 
influence in the wake of the june crackdown on dissent 
official newspapers wednesday reprinted a 1956 article by senior 
leader deng xiaoping that focused on the partys efforts to adapt 
socialism to fit chinas needs and its duty to set a moral example 
for the public 
deng responding to questions raised by a youth group said 
communist party members were advanced elements among the common 
people who can lead china down the happy road to socialism 
the renewed call for party members to serve the people 
wholeheartedly is part of the partys effort to regain public 
confidence following massive prodemocracy protests this year 
party hardliners who ordered the army to crush the studentled 
protests on june 34 are blaming the demonstrations and violence on 
ousted party leader zhao ziyang and a small group of dissidents it 
accuses of promoting antichinese or unpatriotic ideas 
there are no signs yet of the xenophobia of the 196676 
ultraleftist cultural revolution when even tenuous contacts with 
the outside world drew severe political persecution 
after a decade of openness chinas leaders appear unwilling to 
jeopardize foreign trade and international aid they make only vague 
attacks on western democratic ideas 
but those attacks portray the communist party as the nations 
defenders against a conspiracy to replace its customs and traditions 
with western culture and socialism with capitalism 
today restoration of capitalism in china can only turn the 
socialist country into a dependency of the west the chinese nation 
except for the traitors will never agree to this the peoples 
daily said tuesday 
state council spokesman yuan mu on wednesday accused some 
foreign powers of contributing to the prodemocracy movement and 
of stirring up a wave of antichinese feeling 
the party has justified its arrests of many chinese dissidents by 
charging that they opposed communism and rejected chinese culture 
dissidents such as astrophysicist fang lizhi who is in hiding in 
the us embassy in beijing looked down on chinas ancient land 
and our yellowskinned countrymen to such an extent that they even 
dreamed of extinguishing the chinese race the beijing daily said 
the official commentaries blame zhao who is believed to be under 
house arrest for corruption and have repeatedly criticized him for 
supporting a controversial tv series broadcast last year river 
elegy that questions the superiority of traditional chinese 
culture 
river elegy taunted and condemned the yellow river and the 
great wall and went on to use yellow water yellow soil 
yellow beans yellow rice and yellow skin as signs of chinas 
backward and hopeless civilization the beijing daily said 
the peoples daily the official party newspaper said the series 
repudiates the achievements made by socialist china while 
eulogizing and beautifying western or capitalist civilization 
an author of the series su xiaokang is blamed in some accounts 
for inciting the prodemocracy protests with zhaos support 
but su who was arrested in june said river elegy was 
intended to encourage enlightenment and help the chinese people 
find a way out for their country 
the partys efforts to meld partriotism and party influence is 
aimed at recapturing the influence lost by the prodemocracy 
protests and the resulting crackdown in which hundreds were 
believed to have died 
the protesters complaints of official corruption touched a 
sensitive chord among the general public and posed a clear challenge 
to the partys moral leadership hundreds of thousands of people 
took to the streets to cheer the protesters and to voice their own 
grievances 
chinese say privately that few people are cooperating with party 
officials sent to work units to investigate supporters of the 
protests

israeli authorities are depriving the 700000 
palestinians in the occupied gaza strip of adequate medical care as 
an additional means of battling the arab uprising a group of 
doctors alleged wednesday 
the israeli and palestinian doctors who wrote a report on 
medical conditions in the occupied lands said at a news conference 
that indifference by israeli authorities and political obstacles 
also have led to poor medical care in the territories 
the only psychiatric ward for gazans has no one trained in 
psychiatry and the only oncology department is run by a blood 
specialist rather than a cancer expert the doctors said in a report 
the group the association of israeli and palestinian physicians 
for human rights said that since the outbreak of the uprising a 
new tendency has appeared the use of medicine as an additional 
means of repression against the population 
the military governments chief medical officer in gaza denied 
the charges we dont mix medicine and politics said dr 
yitzhak peterburg 
he added that this physicians association is known for its 
imprecision and slanting of facts 
the doctors conceded that since israel captured the gaza strip 
from egypt in the 1967 middle east war medical treatment for gazans 
has vastly improved for example infant mortality has dropped from 
86 deaths per 1000 babies to 28 deaths between 1970 and 1988 
but they said the improvements came mainly because israeli 
hospitals were available to gaza residents they said facilities in 
gaza have been ignored 
the doctors said the need for medical care has risen steeply 
because of the 20monthold uprising which has killed 536 
palestinians and wounded thousands in clashes with the army and 
jewish settlers 
the inadequacy of medical services has created a situation where 
gazans are completely dependent on the decisions of the military 
government the doctors said 
it cited a severe shortage of doctors one per 1400 residents 
in gaza compared with one per 400 residents in israel it also 
claimed that israeli policies prevent dozens of arab doctors from 
working 
no services exist in gaza for chest or blood vessel surgery 
neurosurgery radiation treatment pathology or handicapped 
rehabilitation the report said 
it charged that during armyimposed curfews people who need 
medical care often could not get to clinics or hospitals it also 
said army troops had thrown tear gas inside hospitals and entered 
some facilities to beat patients and medical staff 
peterburg said soldiers were under strict orders not to interfere 
with hospitals but could enter to make arrests he said soldiers 
caught in beating incidents were punished 
while acknowledging that health services in gaza were not on a 
par with those of israel he said if you look at the area over a 
period of years and remember where we started the figures show that 
there has been constant improvement even during the uprising

president mikhail s gorbachev and the kremlin 
leadership on wednesday rejected as unconstitutional a new estonian 
law that denies some russian residents of the balitic republic the 
right to vote 
they called it a violation of human rights 
however the supreme soviet presidium the governments top 
executive body has apparently sought to avoid a contest of wills 
with estonian leaders over the law which has touched off an 
8dayold protest strike by tens of thousands of ethnic russians who 
live in the tiny baltic republic 
instead the presidium said that by oct 1 estonias government 
would present the republics legislature with proposals to bring the 
law into line with the soviet constitution the tass news agency 
reported that seemed to indicate agreement on both sides to avert a 
crisis 
leaders in the republic of 16 million people which declared its 
sovereignty in november have rejected attempts by moscowbased 
authorities to annul their laws but both sides have avoided 
bringing matters to a head 
estonian president arnold ruutel met with the presidium in the 
kremlin wednesday and explained the reasons that led to adoption of 
the election law tass said it was not clear whether he agreed it 
should be revised 
ethnic estonians have called the morerestrictive law a necessity 
to ensure they maintain political control in their ethnic homeland 
and are not overwhelmed by an influx of ethnic russians and soviet 
outsiders lured by estonias higher living standards 
but the presidium found that the laws restrictions which 
justice minister veniamin yakovlev said constitute the soviet 
unions first residency requirements for voting and holding office 
violate human rights including in the international covenant on 
human rights tass said 
the law limits the right to vote and hold office to longterm 
residents 
among diplomatic commitments entered into by the soviets that are 
violated by the law is a covenent guarantee that each citizen 
should have the right and possibility to vote without any 
discrimination and without groundless restrictions the presidium 
said 
the soviet constitution its demands of equality of rights of 
citizens and equality of citizens before the law must be observed 
unconditionally there is no other way said vice president 
anatoly i lukyanov a gorbachev protege who chaired the meeting 
excerpts of the session were shown by state television 
gorbachev the presidiums chairman did not take part but tass 
said he signed the decree at the kremlin giving it his personal 
stamp of approval the soviet leader has been rumored to be on his 
customary august vacation 
the aug 8 decision of estonias supreme soviet parliament to 
limit the right of suffrage and officeholding ignited a strike that 
continued wednesday strike committee member vasily maximov said by 
telephone from estonias capital tallinn that more than 20000 
workers have walked off the job shutting down 51 factories and 
enterprises 
official soviet media have said the strike in one of the 
countrys most economically advanced republics has cost the national 
economy millions of rubles 
more than 2000 loaded freight cars are sitting idle and dock 
workers at tallinns two ports also have joined the walkout tass 
reported 
the government newspaper izvestia said wednesday the estonian 
government had annulled its own aug 10 decree that had ordered an 
immediate end to the strike but which stiffened strikers 
resistance instead 
protest leaders said the decision which they called an attempt 
to appease them would have no effect 
our demands are political not economic said maximov we 
are fighting for our political rights 
leaders of the strike which began the day after the more 
restrictive election law was adopted say the measure 
disenfranchises many ethnic russians and other recent arrivals in 
the republic of estonias total population 65 percent are ethnic 
estonians and 28 percent are ethnic russians 
while the presidium was in session a commission of soviet 
parliamentarians toured estonian factories hit by the strike and 
spoke with workers said mikhail lysenko another strike committee 
member 
the panel of legislators met tuesday night with the strike 
committee lysenko said from tallinn 
under the new election law residents of estonia must live in the 
same district for at least two years or anywhere in estonia for a 
total of five years to be able to vote candidates for elective 
office must have lived in the same spot for five years or in estonia 
for 10 years 
by declaring the law unconstitutional the presidium again was 
taking issue with the republics claim of sovereignty proclaimed 
in november by estonias supreme soviet which said the 
independentminded republic could set its own policy in all fields 
except foreign policy and defense 
moscow authorities pronounced that concept invalid but the 
estonian parliament has stood by its vote this year estonian 
lawmakers also declared estonian the republics official language 
and approved limited private property

negotiators for the philippines and bank 
creditors announced tentative agreement wednesday on a new debt 
package allowing the bush administration to claim a second victory 
for its program to reduce the debt burden being carried by the third 
world 
the philippines will receive new money in addition to a partial 
reduction in its 28 billion debt burden about half of which is 
owed to commercial banks 
the philippines agreement follows an accord reached last month 
with mexico the developing worlds second largest debtor with 108 
billion in loans 
the bush administration hailed the philippines pact as evidence 
that its initiative to reduce the 13 trillion third world debt 
burden was bearing fruit private economists however were less 
enthusiastic saying the amount of actual debt reduction was likely 
to be modest both for the philippines and mexico 
treasury secretary nicholas brady who was briefed on the details 
of the debt plan wednesday by top philippine negotiators predicted 
that it would promote significant debt reduction while also 
providing new money 
brady on march 10 unveiled the administrations new approach to 
third world debt the effort seeks to get commercial banks to 
voluntarily forgive a portion of the loans they hold in return for 
guarantees from the international monetary fund and the world bank 
that the reduced debt would be repaid 
in the mexican agreement banks were given the choice of reducing 
interest or principle on the old debt or lending new money 
the same option of reducing old debt or supplying new money will 
apply for the philippines officials said they stressed that the 
exact amounts of new money and debt relief will not be known until 
the commercial banks holding the debt make their individual 
decisions on which option to take 
philippine negotiators who had been seeking new bank loans of as 
much as 17 billion expressed happiness with the outcome of the 
discussions which were held in new york 
jose fernandez the philippine central bank governor who led his 
countrys negotiating team said that the combined effect of the 
debt reduction and an improving economy would eventually bring 
about the end of the debt problem for the philippines 
mexico and the philippines were considered two of the best 
candidates for the brady debtrelief plan discussions with two 
other leading candidates costa rica and venezuela are currently 
stalled 
private economists said that the brady initiative was still a 
long way from its goal of reducing the pool of commercial bank debt 
by 20 percent for the worlds 39 most heavily indebted nations 
this is an incremental change rather than an explosive 
change said richard feinberg head of the overseas development 
council a research group specializing in developing countries it 
would be a mistake to argue that there is great momentum behind debt 
relief 
cynthia latta an economist with drimcgraw hill said that the 
debt relief in the case of both mexico and the philippines was 
likely to be modest as long as the packages remained voluntary on 
the part of the banks 
you need a coordinated effort and some type of enforcement 
mechanism that says everybody has to write off a certain portion of 
the debt she said if you are just piling new loans on old 
loans with little actual debt relief all you have bought is more 
time 
david l pflug senior vice president of manufacturers hanover 
trust co and the leader of the bank negotiating team said that the 
options of granting debt relief or providing new lending would 
appeal to two separate categories of banks those that wish to 
exit from the process as opposed to those that have determined to 
maintain their credit relationships in the country 
both sides predicted that a final agreement on all outstanding 
issues with the philippines would be reached in september

dissident czechoslovak playwright vaclav 
havel urged his countrymen to refrain from street protests marking 
the 1968 sovietled invasion because such rallies may spur a harsh 
crackdown by authorities 
monday is the anniversary of the aug 21 1968 invasion that 
crushed the prague spring reforms that briefly liberalized czech 
society 
in a statement dated aug 14 and released wednesday by the 
londonbased emigre publishers palach press havel said he could 
understand that czechoslovaks might believe street protests are the 
only way to vent frustrations 
but he added i personally believe there is no point in 
resorting predominantly or exclusively to this method of protest now 
when authorities are waiting exactly for this type of action in 
order to be able to strike hard to paralyze peoples democratization 
for a long time to come 
havel instead urged citizens to sign the petition known as a 
few sentences which has garnered an estimated 15000 signatures 
since it was first distributed in late june 
the petition demands democratic reforms and negotiations with 
communist authorities it has come under fierce attack in the 
staterun media and from party leaders who have rejected the sort of 
political reforms occurring in poland hungary and the soviet union 
protests during last years anniversary failed to nudge the 
government closer to reform but resulted in at least three petitions 
for democratic change and an increased activism among dissidents 
this year authorities have warned they wont tolerate 
disturbances and will do what is necessary to maintain public order 
czechslovakias official human rights committee appealed to 
citizens to avert street violence on the anniversary prague 
newspapers reported wednesday 
the committee was established on dec 9 1988 in an apparent 
move to offset the rising wave of dissident protest but activists 
say it lacks the courage to speak out against police brutality 
having the experience of january we express our anxiety over 
the possible manifestations of demagoguery general nihilism or 
violence in the forthcoming days the human rights committees 
appeal warned 
the statement referred to protests that broke out in january 
marking the 20th anniversary of the death of jan palach who set 
himself on fire to protest the 1968 invasion 
havel was arrested during one such protest and was jailed for 
four months several dissidents have been harassed in advance of the 
anniversary dissidents jan carnogursky and miroslav kusy were 
detained in the slovak capital of bratislava on monday apparently 
in connection with the few sentences petition 
two weeks ago havel was detained twice in two days and warned to 
stay out of prague 
last week six independent czechoslovak human rights groups 
called for two minutes of silence at 5 pm on aug 21 
havel 52 appeared to encourage his fellow citizens to be 
optimistic that change is coming 
i am firmly convinced that a thorough revision of the official 
view of the august 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia is irrevocably 
drawing near havel wrote 
havel cited fridays statement by a hungarian official that the 
invasion was essentially wrong and a polish senate resolution 
condemning the warsaw pact invasion 
on wednesday hungarys ruling communists distanced themselves 
even further from the 1968 invasion 
in a statement carried by the official mti news agency the 
ruling politburo of the hungarian socialist workers party said the 
partys present leadership does not concur with the 1968 
military intervention in czechoslovakia 
the czechoslovak state news agency criticized the hungarian 
statement as helping czechoslovak and foreign antisocialist 
forces they incited by reactionary circles of the west want in 
contradiction with the historic truth to misuse the events of 1968 
against restructuring and democratization inh czechoslovakia

this 1870 mining boomtown that now is home 
to just a few people got something of a reprieve from a company 
digging an open pit gold mine that was intended to swallow half the 
historic community 
horizon affirms today that it has no desire to mine its way 
through a century of history of tuscarora john watson president 
of horizon gold shares told a public hearing tuesday 
watson said the company which originally wanted to expand its 
open pit into part of tuscarora will leave the main town alone 
including three sites for which residents are seeking protected 
historic status 
i state publicly that horizon gold will not invoke nevadas 
eminent domain statute to mine within the original town site area 
said watson adding that trailers outside of town could be moved 
however 
watsons statements came during a public hearing held by the elko 
county commission to discuss giving historic status to an old 
rooming house a masonic lodge building and the town cemetery in 
this flyspeck on the map 250 miles northeast of reno 
the designation is sought by some dozen fulltime and another 
dozen parttime tuscarora residents trying to block horizons 
efforts to expand its 2yearold mining operation to get at ore 
reserves near and below town 
dennis parks a town leader who has lived in tuscarora since 1966 
when he started a pottery school in the old rooming house said he 
was wary of the denverbased mining companys promise to leave town 
residents alone 
he questioned why horizon still plans to go ahead with its 
lawsuit to prove that the company through its centuryold mining 
claims owns the town and that residents only have surface rights 
watson said the lawsuit filed friday in elko county is needed 
to settle once and for all the issue of who owns the land in the 
historic town built after gold and silver were discovered in the 
late 1860s 
there are 125 years of confusing and often conflicting 
transactions that have given horizon concern as well watson said 
some 80 people attended the 1hourlong public hearing in 
tuscarora and 19 spoke in favor of designating the three historic 
sites in the town 
only watson opposed the status saying the law specifically says 
that an historic designation shouldnt be declared just to hamper 
mining 
the commissioners took no immediate action on the issue and set 
another meeting for sept 20 to discuss the proposal 
horizon employs about 50 people to work at the open pit mine 52 
miles north of elko the company has invested 8 million so far in 
working the pit now about 400by800 feet and 150 feet deep 
at its 1870s peak tuscarora had 4000 residents and a 
1000strong chinatown the largest chinese population in the west 
at the time

civil rights leaders meeting here had intended to 
plan a political action agenda on wednesday instead they found 
themselves debating whether blacks have a single political party 
they can call home 
in a heated twohour session members of the southern christian 
leadership conference agreed that blacks in america are coming to a 
political crossroads prompted by their wariness of republicans and 
their dissatisfaction with democrats 
but the sclc leaders had few answers for voters who say they 
dont think either party is sincerely interested in their concerns 
we dont have to sell our souls said eddie williams of the 
joint center for political studies but until the republican 
party has those kinds of individuals who look like us and talk like 
us and are willing to stand up like us the black electorate will 
not follow republicans 
blacks have been particularly reluctant to join the republican 
party because they view it as insensitive to civil rights issues 
they also say the immediate past republican administration under 
president ronald reagan sought to turn back the clock on civil 
rights progress made during the 1950s and 1960s 
the republican party recently has stepped up its efforts to court 
black voters and the bush administration has been in frequent 
communication with civil rights leaders voicing support for their 
cause civil rights leaders say they are waiting for action 
particularly after recent supreme court decisions against 
affirmative action and minority setaside programs 
the sclc which is convening in atlanta this week has lent a 
noncommittal ear to the republican partys civil rights goals sclc 
president joseph lowery has met with bush and invited vice president 
dan quayle to open the convention 
teresa jeter who identified herself as a black republican said 
the democratic party has failed to work for the roughly 90 percent 
of black voters it represents she said she feared that could happen 
in either party 
im no blind fool she said how can we work within the 
system when it hasnt worked for us 
us rep walter fauntroy a democrat who represents the district 
of columbia said too much of the twoparty system could dilute 
black voting strength given our numerical percentage 
portia scott cochair of the national black republican council 
disagreed 
im appalled by oneparty domination she said it is 
incumbent on everybody in this room to check out the republican 
party 
i am not opposed to getting people out to vote republican 
fauntroy said you in the republican party must have the courage 
to say to your party this is not a game 
fauntroy said that party identification is not a key question for 
black voters the question will be when i was hungry did you 
feed me he said 
im not here to say the republicans have the answer said 
bill chappell chairman of the georgia black republicans council 
we as blacks should be cognizant of twoparty politics if it can 
work for other people in the united states it can certainly work 
for us 
lee atwater republican national committee chairman and ronald 
brown chairman of the democratic national committee had been 
scheduled to participate in the political session but did not 
attend quayle spoke on tuesday 
emmanuel cleaver vice mayor of kansas city mo cautioned 
democrats not to assume blacks are satisfied with the partys 
treatment of their concerns 
we have been bludgeoned politically by democrats he said 
adding that it will be infinitely easier for blacks to progress 
in both parties 
the sclc convention which runs through friday is being held in 
atlanta for the first time since lowery took over the leadership in 
1977

the bush administration on wednesday welcomed 
the release of 29 political prisoners by nicaragua but condemned 
that nations government for continuing to imprison more than 6000 
people for their politics 
this step is long overdue said state department spokesman 
richard boucher 
we urge the sandinistas to release all political prisoners 
including the 6000 political prisoners they still hold and the 
remaining 39 national guardsmen who have been imprisoned since 1979 
in violation of the sandinistas commitments to free them he 
said 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega on tuesday announced the 
release of 29 peasant farmers jailed for alleged 
counterrevolutionary activities and said his government would 
decide the fates of an additional 1200 political prisoners by early 
september 
the gesture appeared designed to encourage antigovernment 
guerrillas to lay down their arms in the wake of an agreement among 
central american presidents to disband usbacked contra rebels 
based in honduras the agreement calls for the demobilization this 
fall so long as managua moves toward democratic reform 
the state department spokesman said the release of political 
prisoners is always a welcome development but he said nicaragua 
by continuing to hold political prisoners was violating an 
agreement reached two years ago among central american presidents 
the continuing imprisonment of political prisioners in 
nicaragua is a violation of the esquipulas agreement which required 
signatories to issue decrees of amnesty which i quote shall 
establish all the provisions to guarantee the inviolability of life 
freedom in all its forms property and the security of the persons 
to whom such decrees apply said boucher

the syracuse university basketball coach 
his players and the university community will be the focus of a 
sixmonth army research project on grief an official said wednesday 
the walter reed army institute of research in washington plans to 
look into how relatives friends fellow students city and 
university leaders reacted and coped following the crash of pan am 
flight 103 last december 
a terrorist bomb exploded in the plane as it flew over lockerbie 
scotland killing 270 people including 35 students in syracuses 
study abroad program a clay ny couple and three other central 
new york students also died in the bombing 
researchers hope to gather data on how people handle grief and 
how best to instruct counselors and others to deal with the bereaved 
researchers are especially interested in the emotions of coach 
jim boeheim and basketball team members who played in a game against 
western michigan the night of the crash said capt paul bartone of 
the armys department of military psychiatry syracuse won the game 
9471 
it was a controversial decision and some observers felt it was 
disrespectful bartone said others thought it was the best 
thing to do we want to see the impact of the decision on players 
the army parallels to this because when a unit suffers major 
losses often there is not a great deal of time for formal mourning 
before activities must resume he said 
the syracuse project is an extension of a 3yearold project by 
the department in which researchers have studied bereaved family 
members and those assigned to help families after a dec 12 1985 
charter airline crash in gander newfoundland in which 248 soldiers 
were killed 
in syracuse researchers also will study the effects on those who 
counseled the bereaved 
we want to derive the human psychological lessons from the 
experiences so other communities and individuals will be better 
prepared bartone said

transportation secretary samuel skinner called 
wednesday for the senate to move quickly to to ratify a 14yearold 
treaty that would increase compensation for victims of international 
air accidents saying action is long overdue 
in a letter to the senate foreign relations committee skinner 
said the bombing last december of pan american world airways flight 
103 serves to highlight the gross injustices that exist because 
current treaty provisions limit compensation to 75000 
the senate has wrestled with the compensation question for more 
than a decade 
in 1975 the united states signed the socalled montreal 
protocols to the warsaw convention which would allow an increase in 
compensation for international air accidents by establishing 
supplemental compensation plans 
while the foreign relations committee twice has recommended the 
montreal protocols be ratified the senate has failed to do so 
because critics objected that proposed plans still did not provide 
for enough compensation to international air travelers 
last year the transportation department offered a revised 
supplemental compensation plan it cast aside the proposed maximum 
compensation of 317000 and proposed an essentially unlimited 
recovery plan per passenger which would be subject only to an 
overall limit of 500 million per accident 
the awards would come from a special fund established through a 
5 per passenger fee on roundtrip tickets for international air 
travel 
but the senate never held hearings on the proposal before 
adjourning 
in a letter to sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the 
foreign relations committee skinner asked that hearings be 
scheduled as soon as possible on the revised compensation package 
and that the full senate act swiftly after that to ratify the 
protocols 
i urge that your committee take the necessary action to bring 
an end to this longstanding inequity for international air 
passengers wrote skinner 
congress has recessed until after labor day and a secretary in 
pells office said the senator was not in washington staff aides to 
pell and on the committee could not be reached wednesday

wednesday they have scheduled a conference for oct 7 to unify 
opposition to the government and asked foreign countries to make 
sure it is not banned 
organizers include anglican archbishop desmond tutu winner of 
the 1984 nobel peace prize cyril ramaphosa leader of the black 
miners union and albertina sisulu copresident of the banned 
united democratic front coalition

last week said he was shot dead outside his home eric gumede 27

president kenneth kaunda of zambia said in lusaka that black 
african nations might help arrange peace talks between south 
africas white authorities and the african national congress 
guerrilla group if the process of namibian independence goes 
smoothly 
white south african business leaders back from a threeday trip 
to zambia said they tried unsuccessfully to persuade the anc which 
has its headquarters in lusaka to abandon violence 
organizers of the unity conference said its aim was to map out 
the most effective shortest path to the ending of oppression and 
exploitation and the creation of a democratic country 
we expect the conference to be attended by thousands of 
delegates from all walks of life representing millions of people 
they said in a statement 
last year south africas white authorities banned a similar 
conference 
the organizers predicting another ban said we are alerting 
the international community to monitor the actions of the regime in 
relation to this gathering of the people 
officials of the united states soviet union western europe and 
southern african nations have been briefed about the conference 
they said and the current mood of our people is such that we 
believe they will defy any attempt by the state to prevent the 
conference from going ahead 
a nationwide defiance campaign now under way in south africa is 
challenging various racial laws 
gumede was a leader of the kwamashu youth league a united 
democratic front affiliate based in one of durbans largest black 
townships 
his brother popo said a car drove up to their home soon after 
midnight and someone in it honked the horn eric went outside and 
was shot in the chest by two blasts from a shotgun popo said 
kaunda current chairman of the black frontline states 
adjoining south africa said 
we are watching south africa very carefully on the question of 
namibia if it fares well we are willing and ready to give south 
africa the benefit of the doubt we might begin to bring south 
africa and the anc together the path is well marked out how we are 
going to do this 
south africa has agreed to independence for namibia also known 
as southwest africa after unsupervised elections in november 
sid matus president of the association of chambers of commerce 
and industry south africas largest business organization visited 
zambia with two colleagues 
they said before the trip they would confer with kaunda and 
members of his government about political and economic developments 
in southern africa but told reporters wednesday they also held 
wideranging discussions with members of the african national 
congress executive committee 
they said they couldnt denounce violence because then there 
would be nothing to fight this country with matus said we 
begged them to compromise their stance on violence but to no 
avail

the disrupted deliberations in the night 
stalker murder trial resumed wednesday after the foreman said 
jurors had put behind them the murder of a juror 
richard ramirez the drifter charged with 13 murders and 30 other 
felonies shouted out an objection when the judge indicated he would 
allow the panel to return to its task with an alternate replacing 
the dead juror 
i have an objection shouted ramirez using an obscenity 
defense attorney ray g clark told the judge i believe a cloud 
hangs over the jury now a cloud of sadness he asked that 
deliberations be suspended for a week 
defense attorneys said outside court they feared that the jurors 
griefstricken over the killing of phyllis singletary by her 
boyfriend who then committed suicide might vent their anger on 
ramirez 
hes the only target they have clark said 
superior court judge michael tynan ignoring ramirezs outburst 
overruled clarks motions after interviewing the jury foreman 
asked about the atmosphere in the jury room a day after panelists 
learned of their colleagues violent death foreman felipe rodriguez 
said i feel its somewhat tranquil everyone appears to have 
put it behind them 
the judge then summoned all the jurors and told them to remember 
that the killing of ms singletary found shot on monday had no 
relation to the trial 
please understand that none of this had anything to do with 
whether mr ramirez is guilty or innocent of these charges he 
told the jurors 
we must get on with the task that life has given us he told 
themno matter how deeply you feel about her death it is in no 
way connected to the case of richard ramirez 
ramirez 29 is charged with 13 counts of murder and 30 other 
felonies prosecutors allege that ramirez is the devilworshipping 
night stalker who raped robbed and murdered victims in a 1985 
rampage that terrorized southern california 
some jurors wept tuesday when they were told about the death of 
ms singletary 30 who had sat beside them in the trial for the 
past year and had deliberated with them for 13 days 
the alternate who was chosen to replace the dead juror was 
distraught at first but by wednesday she appeared calm as she sat 
in ms singletarys seat in the jury box 
tynan informed jurors that ms singletarys livein boyfriend 
james cecil melton 51 had committed suicide on tuesday leaving a 
note admitting he had killed her over a domestic dispute 
the deliberations have been troubled since last week when another 
juror had to be replaced by an alternate for sleeping during 
deliberations that meant the jurors who had been deliberating for 
13 days had to start their talks all over again on wednesday they 
began for a third time 
the prosecutor deputy district attorney p philip halpin told 
reporters im relieved i am grateful that we followed the 
correct path 
no mistrial motion was made and clark said he was uncertain 
whether there would be one in the future 
i like the jury he said so personally im not crazy about 
a mistrial 
in another development the judge said he was issuing a bench 
warrant for the arrest of a defense attorney in the case arturo 
hernandez who has failed to appear at recent court hearings daniel 
hernandez no relation said his colleague was recently married and 
has been in europe on his honeymoon

three computer hackers suspected 
of giving the soviet union information from military and industrial 
computers worldwide were indicted on espionage charges prosecutors 
said wednesday 
the west german government called the breakup of the spy ring 
which gave the kgb secret data from 12 countries including the 
united states a major blow to the soviets 
in a fourpage statement chief federal prosecutor kurt rebmann 
said it was the first time his office had prosecuted hackers for 
endangering national security 
the men identified only by their first names and last initial 
were indicted on suspicion of espionage activities for the soviet 
intelligence agency kgb rebmann said the defendents were peter 
c and markus h of hanover and dirk b of west berlin he said 
the men were arrested in march peter c and dirk b are in 
prison while markus h has been released pending trial rebmann 
said there was no indication when the trial would begin 
the full range of information the soviets received is not known 
but the espionage activities first detected by a us computer 
specialist had been in operation since at least september 1986 
rebmann said 
the soviets paid about 49000 for the information he said 
the hackers gave the soviets programs and passwords for computer 
systems in industrial and military areas they also gave moscow a 
security pack designed to prevent unauthorized computer 
breakins rebmann said 
the three men broke into computers in west germany the united 
states france britain switzerland italy norway austria spain 
the netherlands canada japan and the british colony of hong kong 
he said 
among the systems to which the hackers gained access was a key 
us defense department computer known as optimus according to west 
germanys ard television 
other computers affected included some used by nasa and defense 
researchers as well as computers tied to nuclear weapons and energy 
research in the united states ard said 
the defendant peter c delivered his soviet contact agent 
serge information in about 25 separate meetings over the course 
of 2 years in communist east berlin rebmann said

the congressional budget office projects next 
years federal deficit at 141 billion well above the 110 billion 
target in the grammrudman balanced budget law figures obtained 
wednesday show 
the budget office which provides congress with nonpartisan 
fiscal information also estimates that without further action the 
shortfall will stay at about the same level through fiscal 1993 
the year grammrudman requires that the budget be brought into 
balance 
the new numbers reflect the recent enactment of the savings and 
loan bailout law and passage of the drought bill and another 
emergency spending measure 
the figures are of limited significance because the budget 
offices forecasts are not used in the grammrudman process 
instead it is the white houses office of management and budget 
perennially more optimistic than cbo whose projections are counted 
by the law 
in addition when congress returns from its august recess after 
labor day legislators will have nearly four weeks of work to find 
additional savings before the oct 1 start of fiscal 1990 among the 
measures lawmakers are already working on is one that would produce 
about 13 billion in savings from spending cuts and new tax receipts 
if grammrudman deficit ceilings are surpassed automatic 
spending reductions in defense and many domestic programs can be 
triggered 
but cbos figures which the agency officially releases thursday 
are noteworthy because they are respected by lawmakers and private 
economists who use them to measure the fiscal effects of programs 
and legislative proposals 
the executive branch plans to release its projections next week 
on capitol hill it is widely expected that omb will forecast a 116 
billion deficit for fiscal 1990 
the cbo projects a 161 billion deficit for this year up from 
155 billion in fiscal 1988 
the budget office is projecting that without any further action 
there would be deficits of 144 billion in fiscal 1991 141 billion 
in 1992 143 billion in 1993 and 128 billion in 1994 
the 1991 grammrudman deficit target is 64 billion 
congress enacted a 117 trillion budget blueprint for fiscal 
1990 last may cbo estimates that if all the savings contemplated in 
the budget were fully achieved next years deficit would be 118 
billion 
many of those savings however are not expected to be enacted 
for example conflicts between congress and the white house make a 
projected 57 billion in asset sales extremely unlikely 
the cbo estimates the savings and loan bailout legislation 
president bush signed into law last week would add 14 billion to 
this years deficit 4 billion to the 1990 shortfall and a total 
of 10 billion over the following four years 
ombs projections of the effect of the savings and loan bill are 
expected to be much different because the bailouts spending next 
year will not count on the budget omb is expected to claim a 
savings of about 125 billion resulting from the measures passage 
according to the republican staff of the senate budget committee

irans foreign minister canceled a news 
conference wednesday giving no reason and speculation arose that 
he wanted to avoid questions about westerners held by proiranian 
kidnappers in lebanon 
in a brief departure statement after three days in damascus ali 
akbar velayati said his visit was very successful and useful 
he had a final meeting wednesday with farouk alsharaa the 
syrian foreign minister but there was no immediate indication of 
what they discussed 
sixteen western captives are held in lebanon half of them 
americans most are believed in the hands of shiite moslem factions 
sponsored by hezbollah or party of god which is loyal to iran 
after meeting with sharaa on tuesday velayati told reporters 
our talks with our syrian brothers will not have anything to do 
with the hostage issue since this issue does not concern us 
he said the visit to syria was linked to fighting between 
christian army units and syrian soldiers in lebanon but official 
syrian media had indicated president hafez assad was pressing the 
iranians for action on the hostages 
syria irans main arab ally has been instrumental in past 
hostage releases and promised the united states to help resolve the 
crisis that began with israels abduction july 28 of sheik abdul 
karim obeid a shiite cleric in south lebanon 
in vienna president kurt waldheims office said waldheim had a 
message from assad saying the captors of joseph cicippio had assured 
him the american hostages life would not be threatened again 
assad also pledged to help obtain the release of all hostages in 
the middle east for humanitarian reasons and condemned the 
killing of lt col william r higgins as a crime against 
humanity said a statement from the office 
kidnappers holding higgins a us marine who was on un duty in 
south lebanon when abducted in february 1988 said they hanged him 
july 31 three days after obeid was kidnapped cicippios life was 
threatened but his captors said they had suspended the death 
sentence 
velayati delivered a letter to assad from president hashemi 
rafsanjani of iran who has indicated willingness to discuss the 
hostage question with the united states but the contents were not 
disclosed the foreign minister said his talks in syria centered on 
regional matters and bilateral cooperation 
israel has offered to trade obeid and hundreds of other lebanese 
shiite prisoners for three israeli soldiers held in lebanon and all 
the western hostages 
the hostage held longest is terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985

news stories about the airliner crash in sioux 
city iowa were followed closely by more than half of the american 
public but most readers and viewers paid scant attention to the 
anniversary of woodstock a survey released wednesday showed 
the latest in a series of news indexes by the times mirror center 
for press amp public policy showed that 53 percent of those responding 
followed very closely the news reports about the crash july 19 
of the united airlines dc10 which killed 111 of the 296 on board 
by contrast 9 percent said they followed very closely the 
stories about the anniversary of woodstock the upstate new york 
rock festival that got under way 20 years ago tuesday and is being 
marked as a cultural milestone 
the latest survey conducted by the gallup organization inc was 
done over a fourday period ending sunday 
the secondranking story in the survey was the killing of marine 
lt col william higgins by his lebanese captors with 49 percent 
saying they followed it very closely 
third with 26 percent was the passage in congress of 
legislation to bail out failing savings and loan institutions 
the percentage of readers and viewers who said they were 
following very closely the investigations of the department of 
housing and urban development rose from 15 percent a month ago to 21 
percent 
only 6 percent could identify samuel pierce as the cabinet 
officer in charge of the department at the time covered by the 
investigations 
but 17 percent could correctly identify felix bloch the diplomat 
under investigation as a suspected soviet spy 
of 55 news stories included in surveys beginning in 1986 only 
the explosion of the space shuttle challenger with 80 percent the 
rescue of a little girl who fell into a well in texas with 69 
percent and the us air strike against libya with 58 percent were 
followed very closely by more americans than was the sioux city 
crash 
the only news story of those selected for use in the surveys 
that was followed very closely by fewer viewers than woodstock was 
the coverage in may of the scandal that brought about the 
resignation of the japanese prime minister and other officials only 
6 percent said they paid very close attention to it 
interviewers questioned 1250 adults 18 and over by telephone 
timesmirror officals said the reported percentages might be off by 
four points or so as a reflection of the general population

as many as 1500 high school students involved in 
competition including athletes band members debaters and chess 
students could soon face drug tests under a proposal adopted by a 
suburban school board 
the proposal approved for homewoodflossmoor high by the district 
233 school board on tuesday night is believed to be one of the first 
involving all students in interscholastic competition only a 
handful of high schools across the country test athletes for drugs 
the feeling of the board is that these kids represent our 
school by wearing the uniform and carry our name in a different 
arena district 233 superintendent ed rachford said wednesday 
there was a firm belief that anyone representing the school has an 
obligation to be an example 
the proposal originated two months ago with football coach john 
wrenn who sought permission to test only those members of his team 
that he suspected might be using drugs 
i wanted to be able to reach the kids i felt had a problem but 
after all thats gone on i realize you cant play god and 
arbitrarily decide who you test wrenn said even so i didnt 
have the slightest idea it was going to wind up like this 
neither did the administration of the school in south suburban 
flossmoor the lone school in district 233 rachford concedes 
coach wrenn said he was willing to subject his program to this 
kind of scrutiny so the administration researched the legal 
questions and decided to expand it to include all athletes he 
said 
the board went even further amending the proposal to include all 
students involved in interscholastic activities the final package 
was approved by a 51 vote 
board member katherine cerone the lone dissenter said she 
wanted to hear more from parents teachers students and others in 
the community before approving the policy 
how the plan will be implemented remains to be worked out by the 
board but the details will be of great interest to school 
administrators elsewhere 
rachford however said he envisions many obstacles the school 
has 2100 students 1500 were in interscholastic activities last 
year 
we may be headed for legal challenges speaking practically 
who pays the public parents booster clubs merchants then in 
what order do we do this and how quickly can we afford to do it 
random testing or not 
there are a lot of questions to be answered before we bring 
this proposal back to the board on sept 5 when the 
administration will submit a detailed plan for final approval he 
said 
it sounds like we rushed into this rachford said but 
there was a lot of frustration that kids are endangering themselves 
and were unable to make a dent i think the idea is that any tool 
we can aquire would be an important step 
drug testing for high school athletes withstood its first legal 
challenge late last year when a federal appeals court ruled 
unanimously that a high school near lafayette ind could use 
randomly test athletes 
since then jake burton athletic director at john t mccutcheon 
high school said he has been deluged with inquiries from coaches 
and administrators around the country they all want to know how 
we are doing it he said 
ben wolf a specialist in childrens rights for the american 
civil liberties union in chicago said the indiana case was very 
different from what was being proposed at homewoodflossmoor 
in that case there was credible evidence that the athletes had 
a serious drug problem he said 
he also called the suburban schools expanded plan the first step 
down the wrong road 
anything that erodes societys expectations of privacy for 
students i think is trouble he said

a new york distributor of airplane parts and its 
president pleaded guilty wednesday to federal charges that they 
conspired to sell doctored airline parts to governments 
manufacturers and airline customers 
bruce j rice 42 president of rice aircraft inc of hauppauge 
ny pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and two counts of 
mail fraud the company pleaded guilty to one count each of 
conspiracy and mail fraud 
attorneys on both sides emphasized that no aircraft accidents 
were known to have occurred because of the parts consisting of 
altered and falsely certified rivets and other fasteners 
assistant us attorney bruce d carter called much of the 
problem historical saying the parts likely would have failed in 
their first few months of use if they were going to fail 
but while many of the fasteners have been recovered or accounted 
for many are in the stream of commerce theyre gone carter 
said 
the counterfeit fasteners were distributed from 1977 through 
1988 mostly in the early 1980s prosecutors said 
court documents indicate the reprocessed parts were sold to the 
us government the israeli government airbus industrie british 
aerospace grumman sikorsky martin marietta boeing helicopters 
air france united airlines the brazilian airline varig twa 
american airlines and pan am 
some of the parts were purchased for military aircraft including 
the f111 the b1b bomber and f14 fighters prosecutors said 
rice and his company were accused of buying surplus parts from 
suppliers and then having them secretly stripped and replated or 
relubricated at a facility that rices customers had not approved 
to make the parts traceable prosecutors said certification 
documents from the original suppliers were simply copied and 
submitted as the paperwork for the reworked fasteners 
theres so much trust in the industry if somebody gives you 
a part and it has a trademark on it you believe that company did 
the work carter said 
the rice case which grew out of a tip from an anonymous whistle 
blower in rices company is the first prosecution produced by a 
special federal task force called northwest defense contracting or 
nordecon 
the task force made up of the fbi irs and several other 
agencies has been investigating criminal practices in the aircraft 
parts and supply business 
rice made no comment after entering his pleas one of his 
attorneys dan dubitzky said rice has never at any time done

german rieckeoff sampayo protested the decision as an abuse and 
unsportsmanlike

the khmer rouge are demanding that references to 
genocide be struck from texts in what rivals said wednesday was a 
semantic battle stalling progress at a cambodian peace 
conference 
less than two weeks before the close of the international forum 
the cambodian guerrilla faction has balked over the word 
genocide and is insisting that vietnamese civilians in cambodia 
be viewed as colonizers 
the subjects are dominating discussions diplomats say 
around these two themes they have launched an absurd and 
indecent semantic battle cambodian vice minister of foreign 
affairs sok an said they are blocking the work of the 
commissions 
working committees which resumed closeddoor negotiations 
wednesday after a fourday break are to submit conclusions to a 
session of foreign ministers that convenes for three days starting 
aug 28 
ministers from 19 nations and un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar opened the conference on july 30 in the first concerted 
effort to lay the groundwork for peace in cambodia 
vietnam will pull its troops out of cambodia in late september 
leaving the vietnameseinstalled government in phnom penh fighting 
the guerrilla coalition unless the peace talks find a solution 
pressing conference tasks include setting up an international 
control mechanism to monitor vietnams troop withdrawal an eventual 
ceasefire and an end to foreign aid to the various factions 
progress is very 5050 said one western delegate but the 
mood i think is still fairly optimistic it is a tremendous 
task to be accomplished in a month 
discussions are heated and insults have been exchanged between 
the four cambodian parties said one participant 
prime minister hun sen and the resistance headed by prince 
norodom sihanouk remain opposed on all major points 
the center of the conflict lies in whether the khmer rouge should 
be allowed a part in a coalition government hun sen argues they 
should not but sihanouk maintains the khmer rouge are less 
dangerous as allies than enemies 
the priority now is to liberate cambodia said keo puth 
rasmey a member of sihanouks delegation we know that the khmer 
rouge is the problem but let the cambodian people reject them 
in general elections 
during nearly four years of khmer rouge rule hundreds of 
thousands of people were killed vietnam invaded in late 1978 
driving out the khmer rouge and installing another communist 
government 
both hun sens government and its vietnamese sponsors refer to 
the khmer rouge reign of terror as genocide a khmer rouge 
delegate speaking on condition of anonymity said using the word 
genocide in conference texts allows vietnam to justify its 
invasion 
the resistance claims there also are vietnamese soldiers 
disguised in the cambodian military and up to 1 million 
vietnamese colonizers who have settled in cambodia since hanois 
invasion and should be expelled hun sens regime says there are 
less than 100000 
sihanouk is prepared to settle the issue outside the conference 
according to members of his delegation but the khmer rouge want to 
deal with it now 
the issue is a bigger problem than it would have appeared a 
month ago said the western delegate speaking on condition of 
anonymity

palestinian activists wednesday ordered workers 
in the gaza strip to join west bank palestinians in boycotting their 
jobs in israel to protest new rules that restrict movement of gaza 
residents 
a general strike shut stores offices and schools in the 
territories for the second day and at least 26 palestinians were 
reported wounded in clashes with israeli troops 
the government announced that charges had been filed against an 
israeli man for a traffic accident blamed for sparking the 
palestinian uprising 20 months ago that has claimed 669 palestinian 
and israeli lives 
the strike call was made in slogans painted on walls in the gaza 
strip and signed by the underground leadership of the uprising 
the 50000 gaza palestinians who hold jobs in israel were told to 
begin a twoweek strike friday the day israel begins enforcing a 
law that requires gaza residents to have computerized id cards to 
enter israel 
on tuesday underground leaders of the uprising ordered the 
60000 west bank palestinians to begin a weeklong boycott of their 
jobs in israel to protest the cards 
the protest could cost many palestinians their jobs israeli 
employers have been under pressure from the government to replace 
their arab workers with israelis for security reasons and to lower 
the nations rising unemployment rate 
but leaflets ordering the strikes said palestinians defying the 
call would be considered betrayers 
israel said gaza palestinians who do not have the new 
magneticstrip cards will be turned back at the crossing into israel 
starting friday 
however brig gen arye ramot head of the military government 
in gaza said later wednesday that some cards likely will be issued 
after the friday deadline 
israel television report said 55000 cards have been issued and 
estimated that 1000 have been destroyed by palestinian activists 
the government began issuing the computerized cards two months 
ago to control the movement of gaza residents cards are denied 
anyone with a criminal record or considered a security risk 
palestinian activists have urged gazans not to accept the cards 
and have entered towns and refugee camps to collect and destroy many 
cards already issued 
arab reporters said confrontations between soldiers and 
palestinians on wednesday were the most violent in recent weeks but 
they gave no explanation for the upsurge 
in the askar refugee camp in the west bank soldiers opened fire 
to disperse masked youths marching with palestinian flags the 
reporters said 
in the gaza strips jabaliya refugee camp youths barricaded 
streets with rocks burned tires and hurled stones at soldiers arab 
reporters said 
hospital officials said said eight palestinians were wounded in 
askar seven in jabaliya and 11 elsewhere the army confirmed five 
palestinians were wounded in the nablus area and said it was 
checking the other reports 
at least 536 palestinians have been killed by israeli troops and 
jewish settlers since the uprising against israeli rule in the west 
bank and gaza strip began in december 1987 another 95 palestinians 
have been killed by other palestinians who accused them of 
collaborating with israeli officials 
thirtyeight israelis have died in the violence 
herzl bokovza 29 was charged tuesday with reckless driving and 
manslaughter in the deaths of four gaza arabs in the incident that 
started the rebellion 
witnesses said bokovzas truck collided dec 8 1987 with a car 
carrying four gaza laborers the four arabs were killed 
rumors spread that the driver had intentionally run over the 
workers to avenge the earlier stabbing death of a jewish man and 
rioting broke out 
on dec 9 thousands of palestinians took to the streets burning 
tires and throwing stones at soldiers as they have ever since 
justice ministry spokeswoman etty eshed said the filing of 
charges was delayed by a long police investigation and crowded court 
calendars

president bush campaigning for a cubanborn 
congressional candidate wednesday declared that us relations with 
cuba cannot be normalized as long as fidel castro swims against 
the tide of political reform in closed societies 
making a 2000mile political detour on the way to maine for a 
threeweek vacation bush criticized the communist leader at a 
fundraising luncheon for ileana roslehtinen who is seeking to win 
the seat held for 27 years by the late rep claude pepper 
as president i will look for signs that castro wants to move 
away from subverting his neighbors move toward more openness more 
freedom for his own people but until i see demonstrable change 
there will be no improvement in relations with cuba bush 
declared to warm applause it simply cannot be 
in a city where anticastro sentiment runs high among cuban 
exiles bush avoided any mention of a recent justice department 
action ordering the deportation of a popular cubanborn pediatrician 
accused of involvement in terrorist activities 
many local gop officeholders and politicians including ms 
roslehtinen have called orlando bosch a hero in a war against 
castro 
bosch 62 in custody here as an illegal alien since february 
1988 has been linked to terrorist acts aimed at castros 
government and to the 1976 bombing of a cuban jetliner that killed 
73 people however his supporters argue that he was acquitted of 
the plane bombing in venezuela 
ms roslehtinen told reporters she and bush discussed the bosch 
case on the way to miami from washington and he was very 
wellversed on it 
its not really a presidential matter its in the hands of 
the federal system she said however she added that if a 
midseptember court hearing on boschs appeal doesnt go his way 
she planned to renew her appeal to bush to intervene 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush would not 
comment on the matter because boschs case was under an appeal in 
federal court 
the case puts the white house in an awkward position given gop 
efforts to bring more cubanamericans into the republican fold and 
the administrations strong condemnation of terrorism 
bush stopped here to campaign for ms roslehtinen whose 
campaign manager is bushs son jeb bush on a roundabout route to 
maine where he will spend most of the next three weeks at his 
seaside compound in the resort town of kennebunkport it was right 
on the way bush joked 
he landed in maine late in the afternoon and went straight to the 
compound 
the republican state senator will face democratic lawyer gerald 
richman in a special aug 29 election to replace the late rep 
claude pepper 
bush was warmly received by the predominantly cubanamerican 
audience of about 600 people who paid 1000acouple for the 
luncheon 
fitzwater meanwhile said that bush returning to washington on 
sept 4 will address the nation on sept 5 on his new drug policy 
it will be the presidents first national address and will 
probably be an evening speech from the white house fitzwater said 
although he said time and location had not been nailed down 
bush is scheduled to unveil his plan for fighting drugs earlier 
the same day 
the president felt it was a national strategy an issue of 
concern for all americans and it will call for sacrifices and hard 
work and he wanted to discuss it directly with the american 
people fitzwater said 
bush also discussed the war on drugs in wednesdays political 
speech saying the no 1 issue in miami the no 1 issue indeed 
across america is drugs and the violent crime they spawn 
but bush saved his sharpest comments for castro 
with castros cuba just 90 miles away she ms roslehtinen 
understands the horrors of totalitarianism bush said 
bushs comments about castro contrasted with his recent overtures 
to leaders in communistled countries in eastern europe 
in fact he told his audience weve seen how democracy is 
surging forward around the world and taking roots in outposts like 
poland and hungary 
someday id like to see improved yes normalized relations 
with cuba bush said but that cannot and it will not be as long 
as castro violates the human rights of his own people as long as 
he almost alone in the entire world now swims against the tide 
that is bringing sweeping change democracy and freedom to closed 
societies around the world 
fitzwater said the republican national committee picked up the 
tab for the political leg of bushs trip from washington to miami 
and then to pease air force base in portsmouth nh from where he 
was to take a helicopter to his vacation home on the atlantic coast 
bush told his audience that with any luck and if the weather 
holds he planned to watch the lunar eclipse wednesday night with 
family members in kennebunkport 
fitzwater briefing reporters on air force one on the way to 
miami dismissed a new washington postabc poll showing that 52 
percent of those surveyed did not think vice president dan quayle 
was qualified to take over as president 
we think the public does have confidence in quayle the white 
house spokesman said we think the vice president is doing a 
splendid job

stockbrokers who peddle most lowpriced but 
often risky penny stocks will have to obtain a new customers 
written approval before buying the stock for him the securities and 
exchange commission said wednesday 
the rule comes in response to a dramatic rise in the fraudulent 
sale of penny stocks which are usually not traded on exchanges or 
quoted on the national association of securities dealers automated 
quotation nasdaq system 
because most penny stocks which usually sell for a few cents to 
a few dollars per share are not listed with exchanges or nasdaq 
information about them is difficult to come by and fraudulent claims 
are difficult to dispute 
before the commission voted 50 to approve the rule sec chairman 
david s ruder said the problem was of great concern to the 
agency he and several other members of the commission noted 
however that most penny stocks and penny stock dealers are 
legitimate 
two weeks ago 14 people and two companies were charged in 
chicago with an alleged 10 million penny stock scam in which the 
companies share prices were artificially raised before being sold 
at large profits 
last fall ruder created a penny stock task force which found 
that a key ingredient in penny stock fraud is the use of 
highpressure sales tactics often over the telephone on small 
unsophisticated investors 
the problem say industry officials lies with unscrupulous 
salesmen who pressure investors to buy the highrisk stocks of new 
or small companies or worse with crooks peddling the stocks of 
sham companies 
the rapidly rising tide of penny stock fraud and abuse is 
the no 1 threat facing small investors according to the north 
american securities administrators association a statelevel 
investment regulators group 
in the first half of this fiscal year the sec has received 2462 
complaints about penny stock frauds compared to 1510 for all of 
last year 
this will help us in our investigations james i goldstein 
head of the task force said of the new rule heres something 
that will require writings to be made said goldstein who is also 
an associate director of enforcement with the sec 
the new rule will require brokers and dealers to obtain written 
purchase agreements from new customers before completing their first 
three transactions in stocks that are neither traded on stock 
exchanges nor through the nasdaq system 
the rule will apply to stocks selling at 499 or less per share 
or to stocks issued by companies with less than 2 million in 
tangible assets

solidarity members of parliament 
overwhelmingly endorsed a resolution wednesday night calling for the 
first noncommunist government in the soviet bloc with lech walesa 
as prime minister 
walesa however said early thursday that i will not be prime 
minister there are better people than walesa for the job but he 
added it was not his final decision 
the final decision is will be when they nail up my coffin he 
told reporters 
walesa who won the 1983 nobel peace prize was applauded loudly 
at the caucus of lawmakers from his independent solidarity movement 
united peasant party and the democratic party before the vote 
i never assumed that lech walesa could be prime minister and i 
dont assume so now said the shipyard electrician from gdansk 
who led the strike that created the independent union in august 
1980 the post must be offered by president wojciech jaruzelski 
the two small parties were nonvoting guests at the caucus they 
have had a long alliance with the communists but agreed earlier in 
the day to form a coalition with solidarity 
in a show of hands from the solidarity caucus the indepedent 
movements 161 sejm deputies and 98 senators endorsed a government 
formed by a coalition under walesas leadership only the five 
negative votes and 17 abstentions were counted 
in a lastminute amendment they altered the wording to leave 
open the possibility that walesa could designate someone else to be 
prime minister 
asked who the coalition will propose for prime minister 
solidarity parliamentary leader bronislaw geremek said walesa 
will decide he said it should be known by the end of the week 
before the vote walesa asked for a new coalition which will 
counteract monopoly 
we came here to change poland i am very grateful to our 
elder friends from the peasant party and the democratic party for 
understanding my game together we will teach the communist party 
pluralism freedom and listening to others 
the three parties represent 264 parliament votes a majority in 
the 460member sejm and theoretically enough to form a 
noncommunist government walesa is not a member of parliament 
whether the communist party would turn over control of the 
government remained a question in a separate meeting communist 
lawmakers appointed a group to formulate a stand on the solidarity 
resolution 
on tuesday jaruzelski proposed a meeting of all the countrys 
main political leaders to find rational solutions to the 
governing crisis 
the resolution said in part 
we think that the parliamentary coalition of the peasant party 
the democratic party and solidarity is capable of forming a 
government of national responsibility under the leadership of lech 
walesa in which all political forces of our country could be 
represented all forces which are determined to act in favor of 
political and economic reform 
earlier wednesday the peasant party lawmakers met with their 
chairman roman malinowski and said afterward that they fully 
support the proposal walesa originally made aug 7 for a 
solidarityled coalition with the democrats and peasants 
the 27member democratic party caucus also met and voted for the 
solidarityled coalition said its leader jan jankowski 
prime minister czeslaw kiszczak on monday announced in the face 
of opposition from solidarity he was ready to step down and turn 
over his unsuccessful attempt to form a government to malinowski 
malinowski has not accepted the proposal and his partys 
legislators said they preferred joining with solidarity 
the communist party chief described his partys situation as 
dangerous 
we have entered a period of an open fight for power party 
first secretary mieczyslaw f rakowski told a closed meeting of 
communist party lawmakers earlier in the day according to the 
states pap news service 
the situation is dangerous but it is not time to put up our 
hands in surrender said rakowski he alleged that walesas power 
bid violated the roundtable agreement reached in the spring 
between communist authorities and the opposition 
addressing the caucus on behalf of solidarity lawmakers deputy 
aleksander paczynski called for intense reforms and a renegotiation 
of the roundtable accords to bring about fully free elections in 
poland in two years instead of the promised four 
a government headed by walesa and spectacular quick decisions 
such as giving parliament control of state radio and television 
would help quell social impatience paczynski said 
in a climate of economic deterioration and public discontent with 
the communist leadership solidarity has said only an oppositionled 
government will have enough support to carry out difficult decisions 
the proposal has alarmed the polish communist party and the 
government of the neighboring soviet union which has said the 
attempt to form the government could lead to the destabilization of 
europe and endanger the warsaw pact alliance 
to ease soviet fears walesa promised tuesday that in a 
solidarityled government the communist party would retain control 
of the sensitive ministries of defense and interior 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh said in moscow 
the kremlin is very concerned about events in poland but he 
lauded as sensible walesas promise not to upset the warsaw pact 
military alliance 
gremitskikh added we dont interfere in the internal affairs 
of that country the polish people should decide themselves 
polish communist party secretary slawomir wiatr told a warsaw 
newspaper however the the communists will not take 
responsibility for the result if solidarity forms a noncommunist 
coalition government 
more than four decades of government leadership by the communist 
party appeared shaky because of the governing crisis that stems from 
its crushing losses in the most democratic elections in the country 
since world war ii

ariel sharon israels trade and industry 
minister got an official invitation wednesday to visit soviet 
georgia the national news agency itim and israel radio reported 
the radio said sharon would travel to the southern soviet 
republic in september or october becoming the first israeli 
minister to visit the soviet union since moscow broke relations in 
1967 over the arabisraeli war 
itim said the invitation was extended by members of a soviet 
georgian trade delegation who arrived tuesday for a 21day visit 
aimed at promoting trade links between the black sea republic and 
israel 
there was no indication whether the kremlin had a hand in the 
invitation but it presumably has moscows approval 
sharons spokesman could not be reached for comment despite 
repeated telephone calls 
itim said the georgian delegation included vazha gingihadze the 
republics foreign trade minister and the head of the georgian 
chamber of commerce it said the delegates were investigating 
possibilities of trade in the medical agriculture and food 
processing areas 
a delegation from soviet georgia that visited in april signed a 
cultural exchange agreement with israel 
there has been widespread speculation that the first minister to 
visit the soviet union would be ezer weizman of the centerleaning 
labor party now a cabinet minister without portfolio 
sharon is considered a hawk even in prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc he was a hero of the 1973 war and 
as defense minister directed israels invasion of lebanon in 1982 
weizman is known for dovish views on the israelipalestinian 
conflict and agrees with the soviet position that israel should 
talk with the palestine liberation organization and trade territory 
for peace 
the soviet union severed diplomatic ties in 1967 to protest 
israels occupation of territories belonging to moscows arab 
allies the two nations established interest offices in 198788 
however and cultural and tourism exchanges have expanded since 
analysts say soviet republics appear to have greater flexibility 
in contacts with israel than does the central government in moscow 
israel and the soviet union have no direct air links for 
example but an israeli jetliner landed in yerevan capital of 
soviet armenia in june to pick up 61 survivors of the december 
earthquake for treatment in israel an el al aircraft landed in 
yerevan again tuesday taking them home 
finance minister shimon peres head of the labor party said 
recently that israel should develop relations with each republic 
separately

joint venture to manufacture medical equipment

signed an agreement saturday to create a joint agricultural company

a jewish group applauded pope john paul iis weekly 
talk on religious matters wednesday saying it had a different tone 
than two speeches earlier this month that the group had condemned 
rabbi david rosen a vatican representative of the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith said the pope addressed the 
question of ancient jews and their covenant with god in a manner 
that is consonant with postconciliar documents and that is to be 
welcomed 
his statement was released by the league office in rome 
the group had protested following two general audiences in which 
john paul said the old testament showed many instances of israels 
infidelity to god the pope also said that god sent messengers to 
convert people and tell them of a new covenant to come 
the antidefamation league had said those remarks suggested the 
new covenant with christianity had superseded the alliance with 
jews the organization had said it hoped the clock of 
catholicjewish relations had not been tragically set back 
but rosen said wednesdays remarks were in line with the second 
vatican councils 1965 document nostra aetate in our times which 
officially dropped the accusation that jews killed christ 
following wednesdays general audience rosen said it would 
seem that the pope is trying to clarify classical christian theology 
in a manner that is consonant with postconciliar documents and that 
is to be welcomed 
he expressed hope that such clarifications may be the

the government fined five stateowned companies 
millions of dollars for profiteering and tax evasion and urged 
officials to cooperate in its anticorruption drive official 
reports said wednesday 
newspapers urged state employees engaged in embezzling bribery 
and speculation to take advantage of a grace period that runs 
through oct 31 to turn themselves in 
those who turn over illicit earnings will be treated leniently 
but those who try to conceal them will be severely punished the 
chinese communist party politburo has decided major newspapers said 
it was the latest move in an anticorruption campaign launched 
this summer to counter charges of rampant abuse of official 
privilege a rallying cry of the prodemocracy movement crushed on 
june 34 
after a 10month audit the government ordered the companies 
including one linked to snior leader deng xiaopings son to pay 
138 million in back taxes penalties and restitution of illegally 
earned profits auditorgeneral lu peijian told the state council 
chinas cabinet 
among the audited companies were two conglomerates closed by the 
politburo last month in the crackdown on corruption the kanghua 
development corp and the china incomic development corp the 
official xinhua news agency said 
kanghua under the auspices of the china welfare fund for the 
handicapped was one of chinas largest foreign trade firms dengs 
son deng pufang runs the china welfare fund 
the other audited companies were china international trust and 
investment corp the nations leading company for attracting 
foreign investment the everbright industrial co which has 
subsidiaries in hong kong and the china rural trust and investment 
corp 
lu said officials responsible for illegal activities would be 
punished by state supervision and judicial action according to 
xinhua the report did not name the individuals and it was unclear 
who would be held accountable 
all state industries will be subject to regular auditing and 
supervision from now on he said 
the hong kong newspaper ta kung pao reported that a kanghua 
subsidiary in june 1988 signed a contract with an agency in jiangsu 
province to buy 34990 barrels of crude oil for 23 a barrel the 
company earned about 74000 when it resold the crude oil at a 
profit the paper said 
in another case an everbright subsidiary in beijing purchased 
72 million in the shenzhen special economic zone across the 
border from hong kong at a black market rate of about 6 yuan to the 
dollar according to the paper 
it then resold the money to the ningpo city development bank and 
other organizations at rates as high as 725 to 1 almost twice the 
official exchange rate earning 516000 the report said 
the official exchange rate is 372 yuan to the dollar but 
companies will pay much more for us dollars needed for foreign 
investment and to buy foreign technology and consumer goods 
xinhua said four of the five companies were involved in 
unauthorized foreign currency dealings 
meanwhile the government announced wednesday that chinese 
students who for decades have enjoyed free schooling will have to 
foot part of the bill for their college education 
the new regulation which goes into effect this fall follows 
several new education measures designed to avoid student movements 
such as the spring prodemocracy protests those ended with the june 
military crackdown 
the government has also cut this years freshman class by 30000 
ordered the freshman class at beijing university to undergo a year 
of military training and ordered graduates to get work experience 
before starting graduate degree programs

agencies said it had started legal action against the operator of 
two unlicensed nursing homes in springfield including the one where

made and agreed to by family members and that ms stringfellow had 
been told 
i think this is the shock of having to change and be moved

murmurings startled a mortician who had been preparing to embalm her 
at the funeral home 
the mortician dennis l porter said he had been called to pick

condition that made ms stringfellow appear to be dead he said he 
believes she may have suffered a temporary heart blockage that 
caused her to lose consciousness for several minutes 
being a blind person she didnt know where she was she has no 
idea exactly what happened he said 
siddiqi said he told ms stringfellow a few days after she was 
admitted to the hospital that she had been presumed dead and taken 
to a funeral home but he said she had no real reaction 
she said oh lord oh lord siddiqi recalled but she 
really had no emotional expression at all 
the health department said its action followed an investigation 
in which complaints were received about the facilities the agency 
conducted unannounced inspections of both homes 
the department said it 
asked attorney general anthony j celebrezze jrs staff to 
seek legal action prohibiting robbie caldwell the operator of the 
nursing home where ms stringfellow was found from operating such 
homes without a license 
referred the incident involving ms stringfellow to 
celebrezzes medicaid fraud section for investigation of possible 
patient abuse or neglect 
asked that local officials file criminal charges against ms 
caldwell for operating unlicensed nursing homes 
caldwell could not be reached for comment wednesday but last 
week she told the ap that the nursing home had believed ms 
stringfellow was dead because she had no pulse no blood pressure 
nothing she was just gone

the christian commander welcomed a un 
call to halt fighting that has cost more than 700 lives but there 
was no word wednesday from the syrians who have ringed christian 
territory with guns and armor 
shelling that has ravaged beirut became intermittent after the 
un security council issued its ceasefire appeal tuesday night in 
new york but syria and allied moslem militias brought up men tanks 
and artillery to reinforce their siege of the christian enclave 
north and east of beirut 
an independent observer said privately the warring factions 
appeared to be observing a ceasefire of convenience they are 
quietly bolstering their forces 
five months of artillery duels between the syrians and gen 
michel aouns force of about 20000 christian army troops have 
killed 772 people and wounded more than 2051 nearly all of them 
civilians 
a spokesman for aoun said wednesday the general 
unconditionally welcomes the un security council resolution the 
resolution as we understand it is a package deal that involves not 
just a ceasefire but also lifting of blockades and programming the 
syrian military pullout from lebanon 
aoun calls syrian troops an occupation army and has declared a 
war of liberation to drive them out syria has 40000 soldiers 
in lebanon under an arab league mandate granted in 1976 the year 
after the sectarian civil war began 
syria made no immediate response to the truce resolution which 
the security council approved during a meeting called by un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
earlier syrian president hafez assad told italian premier giulio 
andreotti he will try to silence the guns in lebanon and promote 
a settlement among all factions in the country assad did not 
elaborate in his reply to a recent message from andreotti asking the 
syrian leader to act in a decisive manner to end the fighting 
the premiers officer said in rome 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher read a 
statement that said in part the senseless bloodshed has gone 
on for far too long and it must cease we urge in the strongest 
terms that all parties abide by the councils call for a total and 
immediate ceasefire 
syrian gunners shelled the christian enclave wednesday and the 
christians responded by firing on residential areas of moslem west 
beirut several apartment houses in the moslem sector were set 
ablaze 
six people were wounded in christian territory police reported 
but they said west beirut suffered no casualties because most of 
the targeted apartments were evacuated during earlier shelling 
moslem security sources said the moslem allies moved more tanks 
troops and ammunition up to their positions along the 65mile 
confrontation line with aouns outnumbered forces 
one said the syrians deployed sovietdesigned t62 tanks on the 
northern and eastern flanks of the 310squaremile christian zone 
and druse chieftain walid jumblatt positioned scores of t54 and 
t55 tanks in the mountains to the south the christian area faces 
the mediterranean on the west 
israel has informed syria of red lines it cannot cross during 
any military action particularly in south lebanon without inviting 
israeli retaliation 
druse fighters seen manning jeepmounted machine guns and 
recoilless cannons were seen in west beirut for the first time 
since syrian troops moved into the moslem sector in february 1987 to 
stop factional war among militias 
it seems we are heading for a new confrontation despite this 
ceasefire call the militias are back said talal hosseini 
watching his janitor fill plastic bags with sand to fortify the 
entrance of his apartment house 
the lebanese capital divided into moslem and christian sectors 
has taken the brunt of battle all but 150000 of its 15 million 
people have left since the shelling began march 8 
adnan bader a salesman left more than a month ago for shehim 
village southeast of the capital he drove to west beirut on 
wednesday to check his apartment in the bourj abu haidar district 
and found it shattered by a 155mm howitzer shell 
the radio reported that our street was shelled i came to find 
by apartment torn apart bader said his eyes brimming with tears 
the shell pierced a bedroom wall blowing away his childrens room 
and part of the living room 
ill move the fridge the stove the washing machine and the 
rest of the kitchen equipment to shehim he said it costs 
plenty of money to buy these things 
acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem and sunni 
religious leaders also embraced the un truce appeal which was 
broadcast by beirut radio stations 
hoss and aoun lead competing moslem and christian cabinets formed 
during a government crisis in september 1988 that also led to a 
split of the army into christian and moslem commands the 22000 
poorly equipped moslem soldiers under maj gen sami khatib have 
stayed out of the current fighting 
the artillery war began two days after aouns forces blockaded 
illegal ports run by moslem militias that deprived the government of 
about 100 million a year in customs revenue

the leader of a montanabased religious 
sect that is preparing for nuclear war said wednesday she never 
urged members to purchase weapons and denied that the church had 
been stockpiling assault rifles 
elizabeth clare prophet leader of the church universal and 
triumphant told reporters after her 90minute grand jury appearance 
that it is not the sects policy to purchase or stockpile weapons 
mrs prophet her husband ed francis and two other church 
employees appeared before a federal grand jury investigating alleged 
illegal weapons purchases by vernon d hamilton a 15year staff 
member who handled security for the church 
mrs prophet known as guru ma or mother to followers of 
her christiannew age church used the occasion to criticize the 
lack of a national civil defense policy 
the church is building a large bomb shelter to house 754 people 
at its corwin springs mont headquarters and members are required 
to build individual shelters beneath or near their homes said erin 
lynn prophet a church spokeswoman and the sect leaders daughter 
the shelters are being built on the 12000acre royal teton ranch 
near yellowstone national park in preparation for a possible nuclear 
confrontation between the superpowers mrs prophet said she 
contended the soviet union is better prepared than the united states 
to defend its citizens and military personnel in the event of a 
nuclear attack 
even some members disagree with her prophecy predicting the start 
of a new period of nuclear tension beginning oct 2 the sect leader 
said church members are praying that such a confrontation will be 
avoided she said 
mrs prophet declined to discuss her testimony or hamiltons 
case saying the proceedings were confidential and hamiltons 
attorneys had asked her not to comment on the criminal case 
i trust the legal process she said i want to give it an 
opportunity to work 
federal prosecutors said they cannot discuss matters relating to 
the grand jury 
hamilton 42 was arrested in spokane july 7 with documents 
concerning the purchases of 100000 worth of weapons and 
ammunition he was indicted july 25 on four counts of making false 
statements in the acquisition of a firearm

weapons purchases which are legal or hamiltons alleged use of 
fake names to buy them which would be illegal

enough weapons to outfit 200 people federal authorities have said

25 trial a conviction carries a maximum fiveyear prison sentence

florida leads the nation in boating deaths 
and unless strict speed limits are set and enforced the situation 
will soon become unmanageable state officials said wednesday 
department of natural resources officials opened three days of 
public hearings on proposed new boating regulations with statistics 
on floridas exploding population of boaters and the casualties they 
cause among humans and the endangered manatee 
boaters killed 105 people in the state last year 25 times the 
national average and set a record in known manatee deaths with 29 
that record has already been surpassed this year with 37 manatee 
deaths 
the state has about 1 million registered and nonregistered boats 
and 35 million to 4 million people operating them he said 
its very congested out there now and with 100 boats being 
added to the state total every day we will double the number in the 
next 10 years said don ellingson the dnrs director of the 
division of law enforcement unless we find ways to deal with that 
congestion were going to have problems 
a key issue is expected to be the states proposal of a statewide 
speed limit of 30 mph on navigational channels in inland waterways 
this would drop to 20 mph in 12 counties with large numbers of the 
sea cows 
except for a hodgepodge of local goslow ordinances there are 
no boating speed limits now 
local and county elected officials and regulatory agency staffers 
from dade sarasota brevard and suwannee counties expresed support 
for the proposed rules with some reservations and suggestions for 
finetuning 
the 12 counties being considered for manateeprotecting speed 
limits are brevard broward citrus collier dade duval indian 
river lee martin palm beach st lucie and volusia 
commissioner charles williams of suwannee county said that while 
there was support for the dnr proposals he suggested a maximum 
speed limit of 40 mph because of the importance of water skiing in 
the state skiers say it is impossible to carry out their maneuvers 
at 30 mph

the b2 stealth bombers 
second flight ended prematurely wednesday when a low oilpressure 
reading forced pilots to land the 530 million plane an hour after 
takeoff 
we dont even know if its a problem yet were concerned with 
it and will have to check it out said 1st lt anu sjaardema an 
air force spokeswoman 
the radarevading aircraft lifted off over the mojave desert at 
729 am for a three to fourhour flight but returned at 836 am 
because there were some minor concerns with the oil pressure 
indicators she said 
the two men aboard air force col richard s couch and northrop 
corp chief test pilot bruce j hinds were never in any danger but 
they obviously would have liked to accomplish more she said 
we did achieve some of the things we set out to do so we cant 
say it wasnt a successful flight sjaardema said 
the b2 a tailless flying wing flew with its landing gear 
retracted for the first time she said 
sjaardema also said the plane flew a little bit faster and a 
little bit higher than on the first b2 flight in july but air 
force maj dick cole at the pentagon later said the plane was 
flown to a maximum altitude of 10000 feet and a maximum air speed 
of 180 knots that is the same elevation and speed as during the 
july flight 
the fourengine bomber built with composite materials is 
intended to carry nuclear bombs and along with the conventional 
b1 replace the air forces aging b52 fleet it is under fire in 
congress because of its cost 
each of the b2s four engines has an accessory drive one out 
of the four drives indicated low oil pressure sjaardema said 
each accessory drive is like a transmission connected to each 
engine by a shaft the drives power air turbine starters and 
hydraulic systems sjaardema said 
air turbine starters are used to restart engines the b2s 
hydraulics apparently control its landing gear but it isnt known 
if they are used to move flaps and other control surfaces as is the 
case on many planes tech sgt donn clarius said there was no 
failure of the hydraulic system 
the air force had planned to fly the plane shortly after dawn 
tuesday but the test was rescheduled for wednesday because of 
delays caused by wind and a long list of preflight checks officials 
said 
the air force tried to fly the b2 for the first time on july 15 
but the attempt was aborted by a low fuel pressure reading while the 
bomber revved its engines awaiting clearance for takeoff after the 
flight was cancelled workers checked the aircraft and discovered a 
problem in a device called the heat exchanger in the bombers fuel 
system the problem was fixed but no details were available 
during the planes july 17 maiden flight hinds and couch flew 
the b2 for nearly two hours and reached an altitude of 10000 feet 
the government has already invested about 224 billion in the 
b2 program which is 18 months behind schedule and congress has 
balked at the thought of paying more than 500 million apiece for 
the 132 bombers the military wants 
congress imposed limits on the b2 bomber despite fierce lobbying 
efforts by the bush administration to keep the program intact house 
and senate members are scheduled to meet in conference in early 
september to craft a final version of the defense authorization bill 
and settle their differences over b2 funding

port owners and longshoremen refused to 
unload canadian toxic waste from a soviet freighter wednesday but 
the british government insisted there was no danger 
there is no reason whatsoever why on environmental grounds 
these cargoes should not be handled environment secretary chris 
patten said we havent been and were not going to be the dustbin 
of the world 
canada said later it would temporarily store the polychlorinated 
biphenyls or pcbs in quebec province 
the freighter nadezhda obukhova prepared to head back to canada 
on thursday with a cargo of pcbs loaded at montreal they had been 
destined for destruction by a hightemperature incinerator in south 
wales 
the mersey docks and harbor co backing longshore leaders 
refused to handle the cargo after the greenpeace environmental group 
succeeded in blocking another pcb cargo at a tilbury in south 
england port tilbury 
tilbury turned away the consignment also from canada after 
protesters attached a skull and crossbones banner to the freighter 
while television crews filmed from launches and helicopters 
british newspapers have taken up the issue with mass circulation 
dailies carrying such headlines as ship of shame 
londons liberal observer usually sympathetic to greenpeace 
accused it this week of going overboard 
greenpeace is trying to block 15 consignments of pcbs from canada 
that the british disposal company rechem has contracted to handle at 
its south wales plant in coming weeks 
the company says it will defend its position 
in quebec canadas environment minister lise bacon announced 
wednesday evening that will be put in a hydroquebec storage 
facility in the province she said the pcbs will be taken to manic 
2 a power generating station about 20 miles west of baiecomeau 
prime minister brian mulroneys hometown 
this is a temporary solution as our goal is to dispose of the 
toxic wastes ms bacon told a news conference 
pcbs which were used primarily to cool electrical transformers 
have been banned in north america because of links with cancer 
government officials say britain has the techniques to dispose of 
the cargoes and has strict safety regulations for how they can be 
imported 
greenpeace spokesman tim birch waiting with 100 protesters when 
the freighter docked at liverpools royal seaforth container 
terminal wednesday said britain was encouraging the global toxic 
waste crisis by allowing the imports 
canadas only incinerator capable of handling pcbs is in alberta 
and does not accept waste from other provinces for two years 
canada has sent pcb waste from various sources to britain for 
destruction at its three licensed toxicwaste incinerators

president bush intends to rally support for his 
battle plan against drug abuse on sept 5 in his first nationally 
televised speech as president his spokesman said wednesday 
bush who has said he will announce a broad drugfighting 
strategy on that date wanted to discuss it directly with the 
american people said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
the white house has not yet approached the television networks 
and thus has not set a time for the speech he said 
the president felt it was a national strategy an issue of 
concern for all americans and it will call for sacrifices and hard 
work for all americans fitzwater said aboard air force one as the 
president flew to miami 
fitzwater said the president in a meeting tuesday with his 
domestic policy council of cabinet and senior advisers signed off 
on the broad planks of the strategy but the spokesman added 
without elaborating theres still some outstanding specifics to 
be decided 
bush has made up his mind on the controversial issue that had 
divided his advisers whether to withhold federal highway funds 
criminal justice assistance and other aid from states that do not 
take steps such as revoking drug offenders drivers licenses and 
putting in place adequate drug prevention and education programs at 
schools it was learned 
however it was not known which way the president had decided on 
that point 
bush was to make the final decisions during his threeweek 
vacation in kennebunkport maine where he headed after leaving 
miami wednesday 
the official said the antidrug strategy envisions expanded use 
of the us military to help combat drugs at the source in foreign 
countries when those countries request assistance 
he said that the price tag for what has been touted as a major 
crossagency program is being closely held by the office of 
management and budget 
bush said tuesday that he would not reveal the cost before sept 
5 and that decisions were still being made on what programs 
elsewhere in government would have to be tightened to pay for an 
expanded war on drugs he said his plan would require commitment 
and sacrifice and understanding by americans 
nonetheless there have been various reports of what the cost 
would be an administation official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said wednesday night the cost would be roughly a 
billion dollars more than what bush set down in his february 
budget proposal 
the bush budget called for 55 billion for antidrug spending 
during the fiscal year beginning oct 1 which would be a 21 percent 
increase from this years spending the administration officials 
report would imply spending of 65 billion an increase of about 41 
percent 
on wednesday at a miami fundraising lunch for congressional 
candidate ileana roslehtinen bush said the no 1 issue in 
miami and the no 1 issue across america is drugs and the violent 
crime they spawn 
a strong foreign policy hopes and plans for our children and 
our elderly all our dreams and best intentions will be for naught 
if we cannot win the war against the thunder in the streets and the 
evil that men do he said 
ms roslehtinen a republican state senator will face 
democratic lawyer gerald richman in a special aug 29 election to 
replace the late rep claude pepper 
drug policy coordinator william j bennett has called for a 
dramatic increase in drug treatment funds for 1990 according to a 
draft of his national drug strategy 
the draft obtained by the associated press revealed that bennett 
wanted 925 million for drug treatment next year a 49 percent 
increase over the 621 million in the current budget and a 26 
percent increase over the 735 million that bush had sought in his 
budget request earlier this year 
the draft also called for 12 billion for new prisons and the 
expansion of federal prison capacity by 85 percent and for 
increases in most law enforcement efforts including an additional 
200 million for a total of 350 million for state and local 
enforcement efforts 
in addition bennett sought 12 billion for prevention efforts 
a 28 percent over current spending 
the draft strategy also called for spending 50 million for the 
department of housing and urban development 45 million of which 
would be used for security improvements

gov buddy roemer decided wednesday to 
spare the life of condemned murderer ronald monroe although the 
evidence is persuasive to me that he is guilty 
monroe 34 was to have died in the electric chair on aug 30 for 
the 1977 death of his landlady lenora collins who was stabbed 
repeatedly while her two children watched they later testified that 
monroe was the killer 
monroe labeled by his attorneys as borderline mentally retarded 
had exhausted all appeals he has insisted he is innocent for more 
than a decade 
the commutation means that monroe must serve the rest of his life 
in prison without a chance for parole roemer said 
roemers decision came after private meetings with defense 
attorneys prosecutors and with one of the victims children 
theodise collins 24 
defense attorneys contended that lenora collins was killed by an 
exboyfriend george stinson they say stinson admitted the murder 
in 1980 to a cellmate in a michigan prison stinson has a history of 
stabbing women and of intimidating witnesses the defense said 
defense attorney douglas morris said that stinson intimidated the 
collins children so they would identify monroe as the killer 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals considering the defense 
claims last year said there was no evidence to back up the 
allegations 
the panel noted that stinson was given immunity and testified 
that while serving time in michigan for fatally stabbing his 
commonlaw wife he told a cellmate that lenora collins died in a 
similar fashion but he did not say or imply that he personally had 
any guilt in her collins death 
roemer talked at length to theodise collins wednesday about 
stinson 
he asked me whether i was positive about the person who killed 
my mother she told reporters later my response was of course 
ronald monroe he asked if i had been mentally physically or 
sexually abused by anyone in connection with the case especially 
george stinson my reply of course was no 
roemer said he felt the two juries that tried monroe were wrong 
to give him the death sentence 
the developments in this case have been several which say that 
ronald monroe had no evidence of criminal activities zero roemer 
said ronald monroe had lived in that house next door for years 
with no violence 
while there is guilt for monroe in an execution in this 
country the test ought not be reasonable doubt the test ought to 
be is there any doubt he met the test for guilty but not 
execution 
collins said if roemer decided to stop the execution she would 
not be angry although she felt monroe should die 
he roemer has a job he has to do she said i dont think 
the question is whether ronald monroe is guilty or not i think its 
exactly what are we supposed to do with him now

cancer and lung disease the legacies of soviet 
nuclear tests carried out decades ago are ravaging the reindeer 
herders who live across the bering strait from alaska a moscow 
weekly reported wednesday 
the cancer rate among natives of the chukotka peninsula is 23 
times higher than the national average virtually the entire 
population suffers from tuberculosis and 90 percent from chronic 
lung disease moscow news said 
it said the general radiation level on the peninsula was at least 
twice as high as normal and equal to the average dose received by 
people living in areas around the chernobyl nuclear power plant 
in part because of their drastically reduced immunity the 
average lifespan of the natives known as the chukchi is only 45 
years moscow news reported 
the article attributed the unusual radiation to nuclear tests 
carried out in the 1950s and 1960s 
peaceful hunters and reindeer herders who in no way 
participated in the conflict of the superpowers are now paying the 
most for big politics moscow news said 
the authors of the article dr vladimir lupandin and historian 
yevdokia gayer said they visited one village on chukotka where they 
were told virtually every resident had cancer 
scientists measured up to 100 times the normal amount of some 
radioactive elements in some deer hunters the article said 
infant mortality is also especially high among the natives with 
up to 100 deaths per 1000 infants the moscow news said 
the chukchi a mongoloid people inhabiting the northeasternmost 
portion of siberia traditionally settle in small groups and live 
off hunting and fishing 
the article in the moscow news was one of many to appear in the 
soviet media recently denouncing the conditions in which the peoples

the states request for testimony on the 
destruction of exxon oilspill records has been denied again and 
the attorney general said wednesday he will not pursue the dispute 
further 
the dispute began in july when kenneth davis a fired computer 
operator for exxon co usa in houston admitted he had accidentally 
destroyed the computerized records he said his superiors were 
negligent in protecting them 
attorney general douglas baily said then the destruction was 
potentially a loss of devastating proportions to the states 
investigation of the nations worst oil spill 
a judge last month granted the state a hearing to question exxon 
employees involved in the records destruction but two days later he 
canceled the hearing and ordered exxon to explain what happened in 
affidavits instead 
exxon officials said the destroyed records were on obsolete 
backup tapes and that other copies existed in computer archives in 
court documents exxon said the backup tapes were routinely 
recycled 
davis disputed exxons version of the incident in an affidavit 
the state also obtained an affidavit from a contract employee who 
had worked on exxons computer system the employee termed exxons 
affidavits misleading said fred boness an attorney for the state 
baily dissatisfied with exxons explanation asked the court 
again to let the state take testimony from exxon employees superior 
court judge brian shortell denied the request without comment in an 
order signed friday 
shortell and exxon attorneys did not return phone calls for 
comment wednesday 
baily said the state could have gained a more thorough 
understanding of the records incident if it had been allowed to 
question exxon employees under oath 
im still reluctant to accept the representations of exxon 
he said 
the judges decision effectively ends the dispute for now the 
issue remains alive however in a lawsuit davis filed last month 
against exxon alleging the oil company wrongfully fired and 
slandered him 
baily said a pretrial hearing will be held within the next few 
weeks in the states negligence lawsuit filed tuesday against exxon 
corp and about 140 other lawsuits related to the march 24 oil 
spill in prince william sound 
with the many lawyers involved a large degree of cooperation 
will be necessary to prevent the process from getting bogged down 
he said the states lawsuit which also names the six other oil 
companies that own alyeska pipeline service co is expected to 
bring in more attorneys 
the state has had up to 25 lawyers working on its case baily 
said

keepers at brookfield zoo have been 
donning gorilla suits and expertly aping simian behavior in an 
effort to succor a couple of abused gorilla infants 
the zoos gorilla family has been in a turmoil since the reigning 
silverback male samson died in march 1988 leaving the clan 
leaderless his offspring kwizera a 16monthold female and 
kwisha a male about the same age were injured when they were 
infants then rejected by their mothers 
as a result keepers at the zoo southwest of chicago were given 
the job of putting on a gorilla suit and spending countless hours 
acting as surrogate mothers to the battered infants 
zoo policy is to leave all babies with their mothers to let 
their mothers raise them said dr anne baker the zoos curator 
of primates 
the past three months weve been trying to reintroduce our two 
infant gorillas to their moms after we had to take the babies away 
for their own safety said ms baker 
while abuse of the young is not ordinarily a problem in gorilla 
society kwisha got a broken arm in a tug of war between his mother 
and a childless female gorilla who tried to steal the infant 
after a veterinary surgeon fixed the arm the keepers tried to 
give kwisha back to his mother 
she picked him up then put him back down and no longer would 
touch him said ms baker we kept trying but she wouldnt pick 
him up 
she wasnt aggressive toward him i suspect her refusal had 
something to do with his inability to cling his one arm was 
functionless and gorilla infants stay with their mothers by holding 
on very tightly to that fur 
with kwisha abandoned the zoo staff had no choice but to raise 
the infant 
kwizeras story was a little different she was injured somehow 
perhaps by her mother babs rolling over on her while sleeping and 
sustained some slight brain damage 
the youngster acted neurotic sitting with her arms clenched to 
her chest and her thumbs held tightly in her fists 
and every time her mother touched her kwizera screamed said 
ms baker 
kwizera was taken from her mom and treated for a fever 
about a week later she was given back to babs who then ignored 
her 
kwizera persisted in trying to cuddle up but babs finally had it 
and wheeled about and bit her daughter on the face and rump 
suddenly the the zoo had two baby gorillas they had to raise one 
keeper suggested buying stuffed gorillas and putting them with the 
babies this idea evolved into the gorilla suit 
we werent sure what theyd learn from all this ms baker 
said but we wanted them to get used to the idea of something very 
large black and hairy 
little by little however the young gorillas seem to be 
improving and gaining acceptance back with the clan 
last week kwisha spent his first night alone with his mom and 
then a few days ago kwizera felt brave enough to walk into her 
mothers cage the keepers nervously standing by with fire hoses in 
case babs attacked her daughter again 
but all went well and the next day kwizera was seen riding on 
her mothers back

bhuttos father in a 1977 military coup bhutto was hanged two 
years later after a show trial convicted him of ordering the

a new treatment can extend by 73 months the 
average life of victims of prostate cancer the no 1 male cancer in 
the nation a university of colorado study has found 
this is not a cure not a quantum leap forward said dr e 
david crawford who coordinated the study of 617 patients at health 
centers around the nation it is a step in the right direction and 
one that we feel is important he said 
the study was detailed in the thursday issue of the new england 
journal of medicine 
crawford an associate director of the university of colorado 
cancer center said the treatment is for what he called an ignored 
male disease 
this year it surpassed lung cancer as the no 1 cancer in 
men he said he said about 103000 males in the united states 
develop prostate cancer each year and 28000 die 
we increased survival rates by patients 73 months or 27 
percent crawford said we did that without adding any extra 
toxicity the current survival rate is about 2 years 
he said the cancer is curable if caught early enough but most 
men do not see their physicians for checkups regularly enough to do 
so the treatment in the study is for those who have the more 
advanced cancer which spreads to other parts of the body usually 
bones 
prostate cancer right now is where breast cancer was 1015 
years ago crawford said 
at the advanced stage it is not curable but is controllable he 
said 
crawford said the treatment involves administering two drugs 
both of which work on the level of the male hormone testosterone 
which is needed by the cancer cells to multiply 
one drug leuprolide lowers the bodys overall level of the 
hormone while the second fultamide blocks the receptors of the 
cancer cells where testosterone connects crawford said 
this was the first study in years to show a positive effect on 
survival rate he said

the brother of a man identified by police as a 
suspect in the green river serial murder investigation said 
wednesday he has proof that his brother was on the east coast when 
the first victims disappeared 
robert stevens said his brother william jay stevens ii is 
more a scapegoat than he is a suspect in the reckless 
investigation by the green river task force 
i believe in my brothers innocence stevens said at a news 
conference he held at a spokane parish hall one block from his 
ailing fathers home he gave reporters a list of credit card 
charges and four photographs he said are from a monthlong vacation 
when william stevens and his parents visited him and his family in 
connecticut in july 1982 during the time the first green river 
victims disappeared 
robert stevens said he has given the information and photographs 
to green river task force investigators who interviewed him at his 
fathers home tuesday 
william stevens 38 has not been charged in any of the 48 deaths 
or disappearances of women between 1982 and 1984 linked to the green 
river serial killer stevens is completing a jail sentence in 
seattle for a 1979 burglary and 1981 escape from a work release 
center 
the task force has been reckless in their investigation and 
have done nothing but harass my brother family and friends 
robert stevens said complaining that investigators waited more than 
seven months after william stevens arrest in january to contact him 
for information about his brothers whereabouts during 198185 
task force officials did not return numerous phone calls 
wednesday 
police last month searched two spokane residences where william 
stevens lived while attending gonzaga university law school 
investigators carted away truckloads of materials including a 
collection of police badges videotapes and other paraphernalia 
in a lengthy affidavit used to obtain a search warrant 
authorities labeled stevens a viable suspect in the green river 
homicides and possibly others in the pacific northwest 
robert stevens said he only recently obtained a copy of the 
affidavit and spent two weeks compiling the information that he said 
clears his brother in the green river investigation 
stevens said his family had decided to hold a news conference 
before he was contacted by the task force tuesday he said he is 
researching more information that will prove his brother was not in 
the areas where other green river victims disappeared at the time of 
those crimes 
his brother also accompanied his parents on a trip to vancouver 
british columbia in late april 1984 around the time of another 
green river disappearance stevens said 
stevens 37 a senior chief petty officer at the us navys 
submarine base at bangor is on temporary humanitarian leave to care 
for his father who is recovering from surgery 
william stevens walked away from a seattle work release facility 
where he was completing a oneyear sentence in 1981 for burglary of 
a police equipment store since then stevens used several aliases 
while living at vancouver british columbia portland ore and 
spokane where he was in the fourth and final year of law school 
when rearrested in january 
his name was one of several that surfaced after the nationally 
syndicated show manhunt television program aired dec 8 on the 
green river slayings 
robert stevens said he knew his brother had been in jail but was 
unaware he was a fugitive when he drove his parents to new england 
in 1982 
the green river investigation takes its name from the river south 
of seattle where the bodies of the first five victims were found in 
1982 the killer is believed responsible for the deaths of at least 
40 women and is suspected in the disappearances of eight others in 
washington and oregon from 1982 to 1985

the bush administration is engaging the kremlin 
in a mild war of words over attempts by polands solidarity trade 
union to form a noncommunist government in that soviet bloc country 
questions involving the government of poland are properly an 
internal affair state department spokesman richard boucher said 
tuesday he was using a diplomatic formula that recalled the flavor 
but not the intensity of 198081 when solidarity last challenged 
the polish communist party leading to martial law 
in moscow the soviet communist party daily pravda warned that 
efforts by solidarity leader lech walesa to form a noncommunist 
government were against the principles of parliamentary 
democracy and could lead to a prolonged political crisis 
the opposition has changed its strategy and has taken the 
course of an immediate seizure of power pravda said the 
commentary noted that fixing the polish economy required a coalition 
of political forces including the communists

the bush administration seeking ways to boost 
the us savings rate to cure a variety of economic ills appears to 
be inching closer to recommending increased tax incentives for 
thrifty americans 
us trade representative carla hills added her support to the 
idea tuesday saying that expanding individual retirement accounts 
would make her job of reducing americas huge trade deficits easier 
millions of american savers could benefit through expanded iras 
which enjoyed great popularity earlier in the decade but it could 
cost the us treasury billions of dollars in lost tax revenue 
hills in an interview with reporters stressed that she was not 
signaling an imminent administration announcement on iras however 
other officials said a proposed increase in tax incentives for iras 
is high on the list of options being studied by the administration

when roy clark first visited this community 
nestled in a lush ozark mountain valley eight years ago the country 
music entertainer couldnt believe his eyes 
vehicles bearing license plates from nearly every state stretched 
bumpertobumper for miles on the winding main strip creeping past 
miniature golf courses gocart rides water slides and arts and 
crafts shops swarming with tourists 
clark also noticed long lines of people waiting to get into 
country music theaters where local performers sang put on skits and 
told corny jokes in a wholesome family atmosphere 
i was amazed i said what is this doing here in the middle of 
nowhere clark says 
the grammywinning guitarist and cohost of televisions hee 
haw had stumbled on what local promoters call the country music 
show capital of the world 
with about 20 glittery theaters lining missouri 76 better known 
as 76 country music boulevard branson is also billed as the las 
vegas of country music but with an emphasis on family 
you can see more nashville stars in branson than you can in 
nashville or anywhere else boasts bill jones executive manager 
of the local chamber of commerce 
the list of performers appearing in branson this summer reads 
like a whos who of country music barbara and louise mandrell mel 
tillis ray stevens dolly parton mickey gilley tammy wynette 
janie fricke pat boone conway twitty ricky skaggs rodney 
crowell the gatlin brothers sweethearts of the rodeo highway 101 
ronnie milsap tom t hall porter waggoner and moe bandy 
city officials estimate that at least 325 million people saw 
country music shows in branson last year during the peak juneaugust 
tourist season several theater owners say business is even better 
this year and clark is considering staying open yearround instead 
of closing in the winter months 
i found out after i became acquainted with branson that 
everyone else in life knew about it but me clark said i run 
into people in almost every state who say they plan branson every 
year as part of their vacation 
branson has a population of 2500 but on a typical summer day 
tourists swell the southwest missouri town to 30000 or more 
jones predicts that 5 million people will visit branson this 
year up 1 million from 1988 thats more people than annually visit 
yellowstone park or the grand canyon 
vacationers are drawn by the breathtaking mountain scenery the 
camping fishing and boating available at several huge lakes nearby 
and two oldtime theme parks silver dollar city and shepherd of the 
hills 
and of course they come to hear country music from theaters 
seating a few hundred people to an outdoor ampitheater with a 
capacity of 15000 branson offers more than 40000 seats for 
country music shows 
clark liked what he saw in branson and spent 12 million to build 
a 1200seat theater and a 191room hotel and convention center 
featuring a smaller las vegasstyle showroom 
he was the first to regularly feature topname entertainers soon 
freddy fender boxcar willie and danny davis and the nashville brass 
opened theaters along the heavily developed strip where land is 
scarce and commands more than 2000 a square foot 
its no longer possible for anyone to come in and start a 
theater on a shoestring jones says its now become big 
business and big money 
clark who plays about 30 dates a year in his own club compares 
branson to the atmosphere that existed in nashville the recording 
capital of country music 50 years ago 
not to take away from nashville but nashville is commercial 
said clark relaxing in his plush travel bus after a matinee 
performance at his roy clark celebrity theatre 
here the music industry is treated in its true art form ive 
often said the most fun ive ever had in my life was when i played 
for free youre not performing youre just playing country music 
thats sort of the attitude of country music in branson 
several of the shows are family operations the mabe family has 
run and starred in their baldknobbers hillbilly jamboree for 30 
years initially starting with 25 folding chairs today the 
baldknobbers play to packed audiences in a 1700seat theater 
there was a lot of worry about the future of these family run 
theaters when the bigname stars came to the area said tommy 
bilyeu a member of the baldknobbers show for the last 20 years 
but the more shows that come in the more our business grows 
bransons country music success can be partly attributed to its 
central location 
our major market is the haven of country music the midwest and 
southwest jones said people from texas iowa oklahoma and 
louisiana through the ages have been our big drawing cards 
in addition country and bluegrass music have flourished in these 
rugged ozark hills for years many country stars got their start on 
ozarks jubilee a live nationally televised show in the 1950s 
that originated in springfield 
if pat boone has his way branson will step further into the 
national country spotlight boone says hes working to develop a 
television show such as ozark jubilee that would be based in 
branson his wife shirley was the daughter of jubilee host red 
foley 
i think the time is right for it he said

its a tradeoff that helps to smooth the 
process of governing while the big money goes to the cities small 
town america gets a piece of the federal budget for its cherished 
programs even when they flunk efficiency formulas 
that doesnt cost a lot and it can oil the machinery of congress 
where some of the power brokers of the appropriations process are 
veterans who come from rural districts 
but the traditional bargain is running headon into the federal 
budget crunch these days with spending caught between an 
administration that vows no new taxes and a law that enforces 
decreasing ceilings on the federal budget deficit 
that strain was showing as the house dealt with transportation 
appropriations just before its summer recess the program at hand 
was a rural favorite called essential air service under which 
airlines get subsidies for maintaining flights in and out of small 
cities 
it was vital to the 1978 compromise in which congress voted to 
deregulate the airlines giving them broad leeway to set their own 
routes and fares the program has been extended at least through 
1998 but not the money to fund it appropriations are handled year 
by year and they have been shrinking 
congress voted 25 million in subsidies for the current fiscal 
year the bill approved by the house cuts that by more than half for 
the next year 
the administration wanted to do away with essential air service 
subsidies entirely its budget says that subsidies were costing up 
to 500 a passenger on flights in and out of some small airports 
most of them serving only a handful of passengers each day 
the house bill appropriates 124 million for the program in a 
bill that was designed to cut the number of communities getting air 
passenger subsidies from 110 to 48 
that was going to be done by setting new rules to limit the 
subsidy to no more than 25 per passenger matching the estimated 
cost of amtrak rail subsidies and by denying air passenger 
payments to any community within 100 miles of an airport that does 
have service that covered continental us airports alaska would 
not be affected 
these criteria are reasonable and fair to rural america 
argued rep william lehman dfla chairman of the appropriations 
subcommittee that shaped the bill the new formula made it through 
the appropriations committee by only one vote on the house floor it 
was erased by a point of order because appropriations bills are 
supposed to deal only in dollars not in legislating rules for the 
programs involved 
lehman said that without the restrictions the program includes 
abuses that make it indefensible so the debate is sure to come 
around again in the senate and in final house action 
over 45 percent or 50 of the 110 communities in the 
continental united states currently receiving subsidies emplane less 
than 5 passengers a day under this program said lehman 
can anyone explain why the taxpayers should be paying 245000 a 
year to fly planes into parsons kan to haul an average of 06 
passengers a day or can anyone justify paying 270000 per year 
to fly planes into lewiston maine to haul 09 passengers a day 
especially when another airport is 35 miles away 
but rep virginia smith rneb said the appropriation cut is 
devastating to a program that already has been reformed she said 
earlier legislation eliminated the worse abuses by instituting a 
subsidy limit of 300 a passenger 
then she offered some numbers that may be even more telling 39 
states have communities getting essential air service subsidies and 
there are 68 congressional districts involved 
eleven cities and towns in nebraska are among them and mrs 
smith said she wants her constituents and all rural taxpayers to 
know she isnt surrendering but will work to get the money restored 
she said it would take another 19 million or 20 million which 
amounts to 02 percent of the total transportation appropriation to 
finance the rural air service subsidies 
rural america home to more than onefourth of the 
countrys population receives only 1 in federal mass 
transportation funds for every 28 in mass transportation funds 
spent in urban america she added

when rabbinical student amy schwartzman began 
serving a small massachusetts congregation at age 23 she felt 
handicapped by her youth and inexperience 
a woman came to me for counseling about a career change she 
recalled ive never even had a fulltime job and this women is 
asking me for advice 
but after two years of handling sabbath services funerals bar 
mitzvahs and assorted life crises schwartzman is accustomed to her 
role as spiritual albeit youthful leader of her great barrington 
flock 
she is one of 90 rabbisintraining from hebrew union 
collegejewish institute of religion who spend one or two weekends a 
month serving small jewish communities around the nation 
the only us school for rabbis from the reform branch of 
judaism hebrew union has campuses in manhattan cincinnati los 
angeles and jerusalem 
aside from onthejob training the student pulpit program gives 
the novice rabbis a sense of service to the reform judaism 
movement in some of these places our students are keeping these 
congregations alive said rabbi norman cohen dean of the new york 
campus 
the 35family congregation gates of prayer in new iberia la 
has been using hebrew union students since the 1940s 
its good for us and its good for them said steve lahasky 
congregation president we give them all the consideration of a 
fully ordained rabbi if we need counseling a bar or bat mitzvah or 
the naming of a new baby theyre our rabbi 
many of the congregations that use student rabbis are too remote 
or too poor to attract fulltime rabbis who can earn 45000 and 
up the students are a bargain at 9000 plus transportation and 
lodging some congregations even save on hotels by putting students 
up in private homes an arrangement that lacks privacy but creates 
strong bonds 
they want to talk to me about everything jewish that theyve 
ever heard of and i want to be there for them said schwartzman 
whose stays in congregants homes have also included nonspiritual 
pursuits like helping out with gardening and teaching kids to play 
knockhockey 
the old people think of me almost as a granddaughter she 
said the other side of it is i have a great connection with all 
the kids 
working in areas away from cities where yiddish expressions and 
jewish food are part of mainstream culture also gives the students 
a different perspective on jewish communities and their needs 
said cohen 
eric weiss who was ordained as a rabbi in june after serving the 
louisiana congregation said getting to know jews of the south 
was one of the best aspects of his louisiana stint 
theyre not a part of a majority jewish culture at all he 
said its not like being in new york or los angeles they put a 
lot of effort into their community because they cant rely on big 
jewish organizations to keep the religion alive 
peter shaktman 27 who served a jupiter fla congregation 
agreed 
one of the frustrations of the rabbinate in general is working 
with people who are apathetic and jaded he said one of the 
ironies of these pulpits is that even though theyre often small 
they really feel a certain mission about maintaining their 
religion 
assisting that mission can seem like an awesome responsibility 
im the rabbi for a 25mile radius and im not even a rabbi 
said stephen weisman 28 who served a 72family congregation in 
fredericksburg va theyre coming to me expecting me to be the 
voice of knowledge and wisdom when i have to learn from them and 
all of their traditions 
weisman says he fudged his first funeral probably very 
badly the blessing of never having a death in my family probably 
was a curse 
he added grinning then i had to do four funerals in one 
month now i know how to do it inside out

rejecting the thesis that jews 
have their own valid covenant with god the lausanne ii 
international congress on world evangelization said jews need jesus 
as much as anyone else 
in a manifesto the congress of about 4000 evangelicals from 
around the globe declared 
it would be a form of antisemitism as well as being disloyal 
to christ to depart from the new testament pattern of taking the 
gospel to the jew first 
the manifesto appproved near the close of the 10day congress 
july 20 added we wish to be sensitive to those of other faiths 
and we reject any approach that seeks to force conversion on them 
repentance was expressed for past attitudes of ignorance 
arrogance disrespect and even hostility toward those of other 
faiths 
but the manifesto rejects both the relativism that regards all 
religions and spiritualities as equally valid approaches to god and 
the syncretism that tries to mix faith in christ with other faiths 
asserting the uniqueness of christ the manifesto says 
there is only one gospel because there is only one christ who 
because of his death and resurrection is himself the only way to 
salvation

playwright neil simon says tickling the funny 
bone is a better way to reflect reality than drama 
i dont think about what im trying to reflect of the human 
condition said simon who is honored on pbs american masters 
next monday 
ive found that comedy is the best way for me to reflect my own 
feelings i think comedy can be more realistic than drama but i do 
like the mixture of comedy and drama in a play 
simon the author of 25 plays is perhaps the worlds most 
successful playwright only one play actors and actresses was 
scrubbed in tryouts before it reached broadway many of them have 
been made into motion pictures in addition to the stories hes 
written directly for the screen 
neil simon not just for laughs examines his style of humor 
and offers a portrait of simon through interviews with actors 
directors and producers and a conversation with the playwright 
the program includes excerpts from the film versions of such 
plays as barefoot in the park the odd couple plaza 
suite chapter two and the sunshine boys 
the cameras followed simon for five or six months to a tribute 
to the playwright at the beverly wilshire hotel to a comedy class 
he taught with his brother writer danny simon and to theaters 
where he put together his latest play rumors 
many of his plays are inspired by aspects of his own life three 
plays brighton beach memoirs biloxi blues and broadway 
bound tell of an aspiring young playwright named eugene jerome 
some plays deal with myself some deal with friends of mine and 
some are just picked out of the air he said my plays are never 
autobiographical otherwise i would call the characters neil simon 
theyre fictionalized experiences you remember 
eugene jerome is essentially neil simon essentially yes 
there is a catharsis in this you dont go into it without purpose 
i think the most cathartic one was broadway bound it dealt with 
my relationship with my family in a more traumatic period brighton 
beach memoirs was a sort of idealized version of that family life 
his current play on broadway rumors is a farce and 
fastpaced comedy he wrote as a change of pace next up is jakes 
women which he said is a mixture of comedy and drama he also has 
written two movies for disney the marrying man and heaven on 
earth 
simon is a graduate of sid caesars 1950s television show your 
show of shows a phenomenal breeding ground for comedy that also 
produced such writers as woody allen larry gelbart carl reiner and 
mel brooks afterward simon also wrote for caesars hour 
i was so lucky to be able to work at that time with the best 
performers and the best comedy writers he said thats what you 
go to college for and i was getting paid for it 
despite his success or perhaps because of it simon has rarely 
been taken seriously by the critics i think by and large ive had 
my fair shake from the critics he said you have to view it as 
a total i think the very fact that theyre doing a program about me 
indicates somebody is taking me seriously when i say the critics 
are fair with me that includes the negative reviews because 
sometimes i agree with them 
simon moved to los angeles in 1975 and since that time all of 
his plays except broadway bound have opened on the west coast 
before going to new york he said west coast audiences are more 
polite and generally arrive on time 
i have an apartment in new york and do move back and forth 
he said but you reach a point in your life when you dont need 
the energy of new york to write you take it with you in your head 
ive never lost that sense of desire to write if anything out here 
its increased

a college student telephones his parents for cash 
to cover an overdrawn check a friend arrested in the dead of night 
calls for help in scraping up bail money 
within minutes if youre willing to pay the price you can wire 
financial aid just as corporate dealmakers routinely transfer 
billions of dollars halfway around the world 
western union corp remains the solid leader in this growing 
consumer moneytransfer business although rivals are giving it a 
run for the money 
american express co for example introduced its moneygram 
service about 1 years ago smaller companies serve specific regions 
or groups ranging from gamblers to truckers 
commercial banks also wire money and even the us postal 
service is considering a highspeed money order service 
its the whole idea of speed consumers rely more and more on 
getting things done faster said jay giesen a vice president of 
marketing at the american express information services co 
subsidiary the consumer market has yet to be fully tapped 
trying to do just that american express just began its first 
advertising blitz for the service recently like the companys pitch 
for travelers checks the moneygram ads appeal to peoples fears 
one shows a broke american teen stranded on the steps of a 
european church on a cold stormy night another shows an elderly 
couple evidently distraught over an unexpected financial hardship a 
third shows a mother and daughter stuck at a remote bus station 
western union which has been in the moneytransfer business 
since 1871 is countering with a beefedup ad campaign that includes 
a tv spot showing a succession of mothers complaining about their 
childrens spending habits the lighthearted ad includes a new 
tollfree number for sending money by phone 
all that competition could spell good news for harried 
bargainhunting consumers who need to send or receive cash fast 
the cheapest and easiest way to gain access to emergency cash is 
through the bank automated teller machine network where fees on 
transactions range from 10 cents to 3 many are free 
but one major problem with this system is that daily cash 
withdrawals usually are limited to 200 to 500 another drawback is 
that not everyone has an automated bank card 
there are still many households in this country that dont even 
have checking accounts said western union spokesman warren r 
bechtel 
for them the main way to send fast emergency cash albeit 
expensive is via the transmission service many western union and 
american express agents are open 24 hours their telephone numbers 
are available in the yellow pages 
only western union allows customers to send money over the 
telephone although it tacks on an extra finance charge american 
express says it has no finance charge but all transactions must be 
done in person 
western union has a computerized network of 13500 agents 
nationwide including many allnight convenience stores 
supermarkets hardware stores and hotels american express has 
nearly 7000 agents 
western union says it wired around 3 billion last year with the 
average transaction at 300 american express doesnt release these 
figures but says its volume has risen steadily 
both companies promise money will be available domestically at 
the receiving agent within 15 minutes moneygram however claims to 
offer more flexibility about where the money can be picked up 
for these conveniences you must pay the price western union and 
american express have graduated fee scales where the more you send 
the less you pay percentagewise but be careful in some cases if 
you send a penny over the limit youll end up in the next bracket 
and pay a substantialy higher fee 
for instance it costs 12 to send up to 50 via western union 
or 24 percent of the principal amount the fee rises to 14 for 
sending 5001 to 100 to 21 for 10101 to 200 and to 27 for 
30001 to 400 the fee levels off at 3000 costing 105 or 35 
percent of the principal amount above that each additional 500 or 
fraction thereof costs 20 western union says it doesnt limit the 
amount of money that can be sent 
for the moneygram service fees range from 9 for sending up to 
50 or 18 percent of the principal amount to 330 for sending a 
maximum 10000 
wiring money from bank to bank is often much cheaper with the 
sending bank charging from 10 to 20 but this service is only 
available during banking hours 
all fees are higher when wiring money internationally it also 
takes longer and the pickup spots are more limited 
at western union which is working to broaden its overseas 
network it can take up to two days american express says it can 
deliver in a matter of hours but only with travelers checks

as america becomes more involved in betting 
sweepstakes lotteries and the like participation in the stock 
market shrinks it is a sign of the times make of it what you will 
in gambling the odds are overwhelmingly against you in stocks 
chosen wisely and held for the long term the chances of winning 
rather than losing are heavily in your favor it has been 
demonstrated again and again 
nevertheless the stock market becomes increasingly unpopular 
even as it makes more headlines based on the publicity or 
notoriety many people tend to think of themselves as the only ones 
not in the market it isnt so 
since 1968 households have been net sellers of stock in all but 
one year in that time the percentage of household financial assets 
held as stocks has fallen to 196 percent from 434 percent those 
are federal reserve figures 
why this should be so isnt clear but the medias focus on 
spectacular daytoday price movements rather than longterm 
results has been cited some critics blame the brokerage industry 
saying it fails to inspire trust many say the industry including 
stock exchanges has done a woeful selling job 
whatever the reason a view of the equity market is that of a 
game people play a trading game a game in which money is made on 
tips a game whose goal is outwitting the system for quick profits 
none of which involves investing 
but as an investment vehicle one in which millions of people 
have their choice of thousands of quality companies the stock 
market has no equal 
ralph tate vice president of aetna equity investors which 
handles a 4 billion investment portfolio concedes that the market 
can throw an investor for a shortterm loss but asks that they 
consider the longterm results 
over the past 15 years he observes equities have fluctuated 
quivered and suffered but when all was said and done a 1000 
investment made at the start of 1974 might have compounded to a 
total of 5622 by the end of 1988 
that total would have been achieved by a theoretical investment 
in the standard amp poors 500stock index which reflects a spectrum 
of the market that involves good performers and poor ones smart 
investors might have done better 
what tate and others with the longterm view try to pound home is 
that results take time and compounding over relatively short 
periods of time the market rises and falls in the long run almost 
without exception it rises 
to emphasize that point tate took perhaps the worst stock market 
period of all time a 15year span that encompassed the great 
depression of the 1930s 
if you had invested 1000 a year beginning in 1926 and continued 
the program through the grim days of stock market collapse and 
depression your equity account would have grown to 19700 by the 
end of 1940 
if that doesnt sound impressive you might consider that 
thousands of businesses collapsed during that time unemployment 
rose to 25 percent the economy shrank and fortunes were lost 
still not impressed then consider that during that time consumer 
prices actually declined more than 2 percent a year meaning those 
dollars grew in purchasing power most people lost purchasing power 
in the depression many stock market investors gained power 
sure the market strikes out babe ruth did too he hit only 714 
home runs but he struck out 1330 times 
says tate more americans should come to recognize the quality 
of the stock markets longer term slugging percentage and quit being 
so focused on the occasional dramatic strikeout 
it would be nice he said to see individuals begin to act less 
recklessly with their savings and put more of their longterm 
investment dollars into equities 
stocks beat most other forms of investment including most bonds 
he says as for stocks vs gambling you cannot even quote odds 
its no contest

for his part kolstad said in an interview that he believes 
morale is better than it was when he took over but he added 
there is a concern that we have people in an acting capacity 
because it suggests that a lot of change that might otherwise occur 
cant occur there is frustration among some staff people its in 
everyones interest that the matter be resolved 
supporters of burnett speaking anonymously maintain that while 
bush may favor burnett a longtime political supporter and campaign 
activist for bush some advisers in the white house dislike 
burnetts outspokeness on safety issues 
these sources maintain that there has been extensive industry 
lobbying to keep kolstad a former public relations vice president 
for frontier airlines as chairman 
neither burnett nor kolstad has made any secret about wanting the 
charmanship 
some ntsb staff members praise kolstad as personable and 
competent private air safety consultant charles miller once the 
ntsbs director of accident investigtions describes the acting 
chairman as a fine individual who recognizes his limitations 
miller discussing the agencys woes points to its tight 254 
million budget and to staff and leadership problems that have 
plagued the board since it was separated from the transportation 
department in 1974 
while the ntsb has no regulatory power of its own it is the 
governments primary accident investigation agency and makes 
recommendations to congress other agencies and transportation 
industries 
board members individually lead staff members in top 
investigations and then in public sessions vote on the probable 
cause and safety recommendations 
burnett and kolstad have sharply different styles and are often 
at odds on safety issues the former chairman is sometimes the only 
dissenter on the board the acting chairman has been low key rarely 
taking strong positions in open meetings 
the other three ntsb board members lee dickinson joseph nall 
and john lauber have had no public comments on the standoff between 
kolstad and burnett 
theyre kind of hunkering down said one source who has been 
keeping a close watch on the agency 
critics of the ntsbs recent actions or lack of them cite 
several incidents as evidence of problems 
the board failed to investigate the complaint this spring of 60 
air traffic controllers in cleveland who signed a petition citing 
highaltitude air traffic chaos and calling for steps to 
alleviate the hazardous environment 
lloyd miller the acting managing director headed off the 
petition before it reached the board contending it would be a bad 
precedent to investigate what might be a labormanagement problem 
kolstad was the board member assigned to the exxon valdez oil 
spill but did not go to alaska to head the investigation 
kolstad answered that charge be saying that he has been very 
active in the inquiry and that he decided not to go because other 
high government officials were going and he did not see the need for 
sending another big name to the scene 
while imposing a hiring freeze to meet its budget the board 
held a meeting for top personnel in miami and the acting chairman 
made two official trips to europe 
kolstad said that the miami meeting provided important dialogue 
with industry representatives and that the board had gotten a good 
deal on hotel accommodations and other expenses he said both 
european trips were worthwhile and part of his official duties

a quartercentury ago betty friedan called the 
oppression of american women the problem that has no name but 
japan today has a name for meiri marimos problem shes leftover 
christmas cake 
miss marimo in other words has grown a bit stale as a 
marriageable commodity at least thats what her mother complains 
in japan where many marriages are still arranged a woman is 
considered to have a shelf life of about 25 years 
when miss marimo was 28 she left for new york alone 
sumiko morikawa sits next to the no smoking sign in her 
waldorfastoria office and lights a cigarette at 39 she says shes 
looking for a new man she isnt particular about his background 
as long as he isnt japanese 
japanese men and women they cannot understand how to love 
says miss morikawa the owner of a translating service three years 
ago she ended a 16year marriage undertaken to please her 
traditionminded brother in japan no passion she says 
japanese businessmen are very nice but they are so totally 
qualitycontrolled they see themselves as company men and their 
wives also they say im a mitsubishi wife it kills the 
individuality of people 
it is 1130 am renko isowa 42 pauses over a dish of vanilla 
ice cream as she cheerily recalls the strict training of her youth 
in the traditional female skills 
i learned flower arrangement tea ceremony and cooking for two 
years i was totally dead says miss isowa vice president of a 
television production company here 
i wanted to start working i wanted to be a member of real 
society 
twentysix years after the feminine mystique friedans 
manifesto of womens rights helped kindle feminism in the west 
only a trickle of women in japan are able or willing to live out its 
creed but many of those few come to the united states to try 
the three expatriates above may seem refreshingly liberated but 
in japan many would consider them wildeyed radicals they insist on 
standing out in a society where wa or group harmony dictates the 
nail that stands out is hammered down 
japanese women havent been raised to have aspirations says 
jane condon author of a halfstep behind japanese women of the 
80s theyre still facing boundaries we broke through 20 years 
ago 
to be good american you have to be an individual to be a good 
japanese youd better damn sight not be says steven fochios a 
new york city psychiatrist who counsels many japanese women 
the women who come to the us then get into the machinery 
of the country are able to enjoy the kinds of freedoms they had 
never dreamed of he says and these women are tough they are 
tough 
miss marimos family frets to no avail to her friends she is 
an incredible oyahuko a bad daughter a few years ago she 
moved into her own apartment in tokyo watching defiantly as the 
social pressures that mold a japanese womans life a cycle of 
temporary employment marriage and childraising claimed her 
schoolmates one by one 
her old friends spoke to me as if they were accusing me 
criticizing me very severely recalls the lithe longhaired miss 
marimo a freelance writer 
i didnt care at all i dont want to be involved in 
housekeeping i smiled a japanese smile and left 
in the united states disaffected minorities organize as 
american women did in the 1970s in japan it has always been easier 
to jump ship than to rock the boat until recently 
today the glacial rigidity of japanese society otoko no 
shakai the mans world shows signs of thawing after more than a 
century of uneasy integration with the west japans giant 
corporations facing chronic worker shortages as the economy surges 
are beginning to open management jobs to women traditionally they 
are hired as teapouring office ladies while pursuing their real 
vocation marriage 
japanese women are even making an impact on politics a record 22 
women won seats in the july 23 elections for parliaments upper 
house female voters had been angered by allegations that japans 
justdeparted prime minister sousuke uno kept paid mistresses 
the election also showed however that much has not changed 
many of the victorious female parliamentary candidates had portrayed 
themselves not as feminists but as simple housewives immune from 
corruption 
indeed apart from the odd individualist who ventures abroad to 
live few japanese women want change 
if you go to a party here and introduce yourself as a 
housewife people will think youre strange but in japan its ok 
being a housewife doesnt bother japanese women because they have a 
social position says kako nakagawa the executive editor of new 
york yomiuri a newspaper published for japanese in north america 
i think in the united states you have no secure place for 
women she says here there are opportunities for women so if 
you dont try anthing hard then you feel guilty but in japan 
there are no opportunities so theres no such struggle its easy 
when i go to japan the japanese women i see are very 
contentlooking very happy says naoko adams a researcher for 
sunstar corp a japanese company with offices in new york when i 
come back to america i notice the women look very unhappy 
frustrated 
while women in japan are largely blocked from positions of power 
they provide a vital temporary worker base that absorbs economic 
downturns allowing large japanese companies to maintain their 
muchvaunted lifetime employment system for permanent workers 
in addition they are the linchpin of an economic system that allows 
men to spend long hours working and as is expected socializing 
afterward 
with the men otherwise occupied women often control family purse 
strings and so completely control their childrens destinies that 
surveys have shown the central relationship in a japanese mans life 
is not between him and his wife but between him and his mother 
so strong is such patterning of japanese women in fact that 
leaving it behind sometimes causes deep emotional problems for 
expatriates who must spurn what they have been taught since 
childhood and embrace alien values 
some of them say they feel guilty about being free as an 
american says fochios the psychiatrist they feel inferior to 
a japanese woman because they dont have the capacity to be a good 
japanese wife 
some expatriate women however simply decide to ignore american 
values 
japanese women are better off i dont think i would like to 
marry an american man says kiyomi koizumi a 65yearold 
neurophysiologist who came to the united states in 1949 and married 
a japanese 
i always say my husband is like air you would miss it if its 
not there i cant live without it but you dont feel it an 
american man might be around me too much

extinction is forever is the 
motto at naturalist gerald durrells jersey wildlife preservation 
trust its symbol is the dodo the flightless turkeylike bird of 
mauritius that became extinct in the 1690s 
its goal is to keep more of the worlds animals from becoming 
extinct 
the zoo boasts the worlds most comprehensive collection of 
endangered species it protects animals by breeding them in 
captivity and returning their offspring to the wild 
on 25 beautifully landscaped acres of jersey the main island of 
the english channel archipelago the zoo tries to recreate natural 
settings for its charges 
the trust also trains interns from all over the world to promote 
animal survival in their own countries 
we are not trying to maintain a living museum said anthony 
allchurch the zoos general administrator we have a job to do 
if it happens that the public is interested in what were doing 
thats great 
founded in 1959 the zoo started out as a place where durrell 
kept the animals he collected during his expeditions four years 
later he formed the trust as a registered charity 
the release of animals back into their natural habitat is the 
ultimate goal for each of the species that we so carefully 
nurture durrell has said 
the whitebearded 64yearold briton lives in les augres manor 
on the zoo grounds with his american wife lee but was traveling and 
unavailable to talk about his project with a visiting reporter 
his books have been published in 26 languages the best known is 
my family and other animals about his childhood on the greek 
island of corfu he also has produced numerous television 
documentaries about animals he is the younger brother of the famed 
novelist lawrence durrell author of the alexandria quartet and 
other works 
the zoo concentrates on six major geographical areas northern 
india and nepal southeastern brazil mexico the caribbean 
madagascar and the mascarene islands in the indian ocean 
it works closely with governments wildlife groups and other 
zoos including the national zoo in washington dc 
if we didnt work with government support and blessing we 
wouldnt achieve half of what we do allchurch said 
the first animals that the zoo returned to a natural habitat were 
14 pink pigeons that were placed in a botanical garden in the 
mascarene island of mauritius in 1984 
three years later the zoo placed pink pigeons in an area of 
native forest that hadnt been inhabited by these birds for 10 
years to date 19 have been returned to the wilderness and 
significantly two have been born there 
we dont befriend socialize train or handle animals to 
enhance their chance of surviving the wild if they ever get 
there allchurch said 
the zoo also sent jamaican hutias large brown rodents back to 
their island and is returning kestrels to mauritius 
a lot of rare animals are dull and brown but two dull brown 
parents with a baby are very exciting allchurch said 
the zoo also has been a partner in programs to return golden lion 
tamarins to brazil bali starlings to indonesia and thickbilled 
parrots to arizona 
in 1978 the trust established its training program which has 
educated some 250 trainees from more than 40 countries many already 
have had veterinary training and they spend two to four months at 
the zoo 
you learn a lot its a great place here said susana 
ringenbach a 27yearold trainee from tlalpan mexico you can 
learn to educate the children not to go out and hunt 
she said she was inspired by durrells books and is particularly 
interested in helping jaguars and spider monkeys 
the trust has annual income of 22 million 60 percent of it

at 23 terri lyne carrington seems too young to 
call an album real life story 
but its not so unusual when one realizes that the drummer has 
been playing with some of the giants in jazz since she was 10 years 
old and her own life story already surpasses many twice her age 
shes on hiatus from the arsenio hall show where shes been 
drummer in the band since the latenight talk fest first aired 
shes busy touring the country to promote real life story her 
debut lp with a major label on verveforecast records she composed 
all but two songs on the album coproduced it with robert irving 
iii and sings on three tracks 
it would seem to be a high point in an already illustrious 
career but for carrington its simply a turning point part of a 
grand plan in which she moves from jazz prodigy to mainstream star 
when i was 11 or 12 one side of me wanted to be a great 
drummer and the other side wanted to be diana ross she said now 
it appears both dreams may be realized 
a pretty serene young woman carrington is modest almost blase 
about her impressive past she grew up an only child in medford 
mass a workingclass city outside boston where her father sonny 
carrington a saxophonist introduced her to the sax when she was 5 
years old i asked him if i could play she said 
her decision to switch to drums at age 7 was borne of necessity 
my teeth fell out she explained during a recent interview in 
boston 
by the age of 10 carrington had begun to sit in with visiting 
musicians such as dizzy gillespie rahsaan roland kirk elvin jones 
and oscar peterson that same year clark terry impressed with her 
ability took her to the wichita jazz festival she met drummer 
buddy rich there who then accompanied her on the television show 
to tell the truth 
two years later she was awarded a special scholarship to the 
berklee college of music after the schools director heard her play 
with peterson during her time at berklee she took courses in 
piano drums and vibes along with harmony and composition 
in 1981 she recorded an album tlc and friends with kenny 
barron buster williams and george coleman during this period 
carrington began to shape her career shifting from a classical 
tradition to one that would bring her eventual commercial success 
when i was 14 i had the potential i strived to be one of the 
greatest drummers period she said but something happened 
between the time i was 14 and 19 i decided i wanted to be an artist 
a singer writer producer 
she graduated from high school at 16 and in 1983 moved to new 
york and played with a variety of musicians such as stan getz james 
moody woody shaw and cassandra wilson 
her career she said has always snowballed in this business 
you work whenever you can 
while in new york carrington began to tire of acoustic jazz and 
decided to move into more contemporary music she started playing 
with wayne shorter cofounder of weather report and last year 
toured with david sanborn 
carrington said she rarely got nervous playing with such 
established musicians carlos santana patrice rushen and grover 
washington jr are among the musicians on her new album 
i usually put more pressure on myself than they did she 
said i remember wayne would say its only music relax that 
changed my outlook 
after five years she began to dislike new york city and recently 
moved to los angeles she lives in the suburb of glendale it 
reminds her more of the suburban neighborhood where she grew up 
in los angeles the transformation from journeyman jazz musician 
to budding star is in full swing the arsenio hall show brought 
her national celebrity her circle of friends include actresses 
dawnn lewis of a different world and marsha warfield of night 
court 
her next album will be mostly vocals and she plans to try some 
acting 
im one of those people who likes excitement a certain kind of 
edge she said i like that place in between being in control 
and being safe i like to be daring and take chances

fifteen years ago an adolescents spinning 
head terrified movie audiences throughout the world as the ghastly 
specter of possession chillingly chiseled its way through the 
exorcist 
well brace yourselves horror movie fans the exorcist 1990 
is on its way 
william peter blatty who wrote the original from his novel of 
the same name has written this third sequel based on his 1983 
novel legion and is directing although legion does not 
concern possession blatty has added an exorcism to his script 
william kinderman the rumpled police detective who had a role in 
the exorcist investigates a series of ritualistic murders in 
the exorcist 1990 
blatty shot on location this summer in the georgetown university 
area where he once went to school and where much of the original 
1974 film was also made 
i would like it to be thought as the one and only sequel to 
the exorcist he said 
blatty held all sequel rights to the original but allowed warner 
bros which released the first movie starring linda blair ellen 
burstyn and max von sydow to do exorcist ii the heretic the 
sequel was written by william goodhart and directed by john boorman 
and was both a critical and commercial failure 
blatty won an academy award for the exorcist which also 
received six oscar nominations including best picture and director 
william friedkin 
locations for the new movie have included holy trinity church and 
the original georgetown general hospital which will again be a 
hospital in the movie although it is now a dormitory for male and 
female georgetown students 
blatty says there will also be a scene on the long stairway where 
father damien karras tumbled to his death in one of the most 
hairraising scenes of the original 
members of the cast include george c scott and viveca lindfors 
as well as georgetown students making their debut as extras and 
former surgeon general c everett koop in a cameo appearance as 
himself 
i think the occult is playing a larger and larger role in 
american society koop told publicists for the film in a video 
interview i think there are some things about it that are hokey 
but there is a very real satanic worshiping group of people in this 
country and i have been involved in public health issues that deal 
with that three times in eight years 
i think shakespeare was right when he said that we dont know 
everything in earth and heaven id say we only have a very small 
smattering of whats really yet to be known 
in the movie koop who left office in july has coffee with a 
priest in the tombs a restaurant near the campus 
the bearded pediatrician said his literary agent called him and 
said the filmmakers were looking for someone recognizable because 
they wanted to authenticate a shot to make it look like washington 
with real people 
the shooting came during the break between spring and summer 
terms so disruption on the university campus was held to a minimum 
said betsy wittleder of the schools public information office 
basically other than when they have some filming going on and 
people are requested not to go into that area because of the 
filming life continues as usual she said 
on one recent afternoon blatty wearing jeans sneakers and a 
georgetown baseball cap filmed a scene in which lindfors in a 
nurses uniform walks down the front steps of the hospital with a 
worn carpetbag in her hand 
we want it to be an extaordinarily good film and we want to 
scare the pants off the audience he said 
blatty thought the debacle of exorcist ii put a stigma on the 
current project but if the film is good it the stigma will 
vanish overnight he said 
the original exorcist also received its share of brickbats 
from critics 
michael billington of the illustrated london news said it 
exploits the subject of diabolic possession without telling you 
anything about it stanley kauffmann said the exorcist makes 
no sense although he conceded that if you want to be shaken it 
will scare the hell out of you 
despite the mixed reviews the film grossed a reported 160 
million worldwide a record at the time 
the film told the story of a girl played in both 1974 and 1977 
by linda blair who is possessed by the devil and causes several 
violent deaths blair whose career plunged after the exorcist 
movies is not in the third film besides scott and lindfors the 
cast also includes ed flanders st elsewhere and sylvia sidney 
the story that i had constructed just didnt have any place for 
her blatty said rather than taking a character i had to use 
and then trying to build a story around her i thought the faithful 
thing to do was to create a great story and see who fits into it 
linda did not unfortunately 
blatty said the sequel will begin where the exorcist ended 
and will follow the story of legion except for a totally 
different ending the story involves a friendship between a police 
lieutenant played by scott and a priest played by flanders 
there will be one i hope breathaking moment at the end of the 
film an effect that has never been seen before the director 
said i hope we can do it 
but the film will not emphasize the spectacular special effects 
that helped make the exorcist such a hit 
this one does not rely upon spinning heads for shock he 
said the terror is in the shadows in the mind 
there is almost no act of violence said scott i think it 
goes to a different level than your normal spooky picture 
but dont worry its going to be scary anyway said blatty it 
is pure entertainment that uses theology only as it contributes to 
the excitement 
i have independently counted 30 shocks or little jumps out of 
the seat some much higher than others

an author named banana a sentimental vignette about 
a bowl of noodles and a slim volume of poems that infuses an ancient 
form with a dash of americana have japanese readers enthralled 
with 99 percent literacy and a mostly youthful reading public 
that bought 16 billion books last year popular novels and short 
story and poetry anthologies can reach sales levels of which 
american publishers only dream 
and in what could be called japans version of the american 
literary brat pack a few youthful writers are dominating this 
countrys bestseller lists 
one bowl of soba has whole nation buying crying screamed a 
recent headline in a japanese newspaper about a short story that 
traces the struggles of a young widow to feed her two children it 
depicts the three sharing one bowl of soba or japanese noodles as 
a new year celebration 
for leaving japanese readers sobbing in their soba author ryohei 
kuris work has prompted scant literary praise but drawn accolades 
from other quarters for reawakening a sense of compassion for the 
underdog in this affluent country 
and for exposing spiritual poverty in contemporary japan the 
story has made kuri a rich and celebrated man 
a magazine containing his story sold out 600000 copies almost 
instantly a book of kuris stories including soba scored 
third on a june list of national best sellers and a movie deal is 
in the making 
rising literary star banana yoshimoto 25 wrote three of the top 
10 works of fiction on the same list including the novel 
tsugumi which has been the no 1 best seller for several weeks 
and kitchen her first novel 
the selfnamed daughter of a marxist literary critic won the 
prestigious kaien prize in 1987 for kitchen a 68page book 
dashed off in three months while yoshimoto worked as a waitress 
the young heroine of kitchen finds sanctuary at night when 
she drags her mattress into her kitchen to be lulled to sleep by the 
hum of the refrigerator later she wins a mans heart with a dish 
of fried pork and rice 
critic shinichiro nakamura who chose yoshimoto for the kaien 
prize wrote that the author broke new ground by totally ignoring 
traditional literary accomplishment and describing feelings and 
senses freely 
i felt a new literature came from this defiant attitude of 
keeping these things on the page whether or not they fit the old 
rules of literature 
another young woman who recently shook the literary establishment 
is machi tawara a 27yearold doeeyed poet whose salad 
anniversary made publishing history by selling nearly 3 million 
copies more than any other book of modern poetry 
she startled practitioners of the 1300yearold native art of 
tanka poetry by using contemporary language including over 150 
borrowed western words such as mcdonalds and valentine tawara is 
credited with revitalizing the tanka a fiveline poem that follows 
a strict 57577 syllable count 
i am using short poems to write about the small emotional 
epiphanies we make every day that usually go unnoticed she said 
many people write to tell me they saw their own feelings expressed 
in my poetry 
tawaras american translator juliet winters carpenter says that 
although salad anniversary suggests emily dickenson with touches 
of dorothy parkers humor many japanese critics have faulted her 
poetry as slight the book will be published in the united states in 
january by kodansha international ltd 
perhaps the biggest sensation in japanese publishing in recent 
years is haruki murakamis novel norwegian wood whose title is 
taken from the beatles song the book published in two volumes by 
kodansha has sold more than 4 million copies since its release in 
1987 and spent 21 months on bestseller lists 
norwegian wood is a meandering tale of love and rootlessness 
among japanese youth in the 1960s and 70s and features a 
protagonist in his 20s who hangs out in coffee shops and jazz bars 
reads the great gatsby and listens to bob dylan 
its a kind of love story that japanese have not been party to 
in the past in their popular literature says kodansha senior 
editor elmer luke the characters flit in and out of meaningless 
relationships but in the midst of all the wandering there is the 
will for affection 
an earlier murakami book wild sheep chase will be published 
in the united states by kodansha in october 
many popular authors pump out 10 or more books a year to feed the 
appetite of a voracious reading public and to keep the momentum 
going in what publisher minato asakawa calls the jitenshya 
sogyo literally the bicycle operation 
japanese authors believe that when you stop peddling your 
bicycle will fall down so to keep your life and career at the same 
pace you never stop peddling said asakawa editorial director at 
kodansha 
but asakawa noted japans literary brat pack can afford to 
pause on the literary treadmill because their works are selling in 
larger numbers than ever before

us roman catholic bishops see traces of 
anticatholicism and attempts to shut them up in opposing abortion 
but they say they wont be stilled and are shaping new tactics in 
the struggle 
theyve put their present emphasis on shortterm partial 
measures short of a total ban 
the declaration by their antiabortion committee came last week 
laying out refashioned church strategies in light of the july 3 
supreme court decision upholding some missouri restrictions on 
abortion 
the bishops saw cause for hope in the decision saying it 
marks the begining of a new debate over the issue but that 
conditions surrounding it remain confused and complicated 
some would exclude us from the debate claiming our 
opposition to abortion is motivated soley by religious 
convictions the bishops committee said 
but we do not intend to be ruled out of this or any social 
debate by spurious interpretations of the first amendment we must 
continue to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves our 
unborn sisters and brothers 
although not specifying who seeks to muzzle them the bishops 
have been in a long legal battle with abortion rights mobilization 
which seeks removal of church tax exemption alleging funding of 
antiabortion political campaigns 
were not trying to silence anybody although thats the 
impression the bishops try to give said arms attorney marshall 
beil our suit is not to keep them quiet but because theyve 
violated the law by electioneering 
however he conceded the penalty sought lifting church tax 
exemption would if imposed would curb church antiabortion 
activity further efforts would be limited he said 
with that lawsuit now tied up in a federal appeals court over 
whether arm has standing to pursue it the bishops sensed sharpened 
determination and feelings about abortion itself after the high 
court ruling 
anticatholic sentiment has never been entirely absent from the 
proabortion campaign but abortionrights advocates apparently seek 
to revivify it now that efforts of catholics and other prolife 
citizens have begun to bear fruit the statement said 
again the bishops didnt pinpoint any evidence of 
anticatholicism but on that matter biel said weve worked very 
hard to remove any trace of anticatholicism from the suit he 
said some plaintiffs were catholics 
the bishops committee in the remodeled planning said the 
bishops seek protection for the unborn to the maximum degree 
possible but shortterm objectives were recommended as most 
feasible a pragmatism repudiated by conservative catholic critics 
although the bishops were early key players in opposing 
abortion the statement recognized that some protestant 
denominations and others now were allies and urged cooperation with 
them some want partial restrictions not total 
by working together with other concerned americans we can bring 
about a change of heart and a change of policy in our society so 
that unborn children will enjoy the laws protection the 
statement said 
cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago headed the bishops 
committee that draw up the 2000word statement called an 
opportunity to defend life 
declaring that opportunities opened by the high court 
decision are limited and complex the statement advocated 
legislative steps such as these 
limits on government funding of abortion requirements of 
parental notification and consent on abortion for minors safeguards 
against hasty or uninformed consent to abortion and restrictions 
on lateterm abortions 
apparently because of past keen differences in catholic ranks 
over whether the church should press for partial or total 
restrictions on abortion the bishops committee urged a united 
front on practical possibilities saying 
groups and individuals seeking new opportunities for protection 
of the unborn will best achieve their goal through mutual respect 
and cooperation 
the movement in support of abortion on demand is united in its 
agenda prolife americans must not give their adversaries an easy 
victory by launching attacks on each other over questions of 
political strategy 
urging that the tone be kept gentle and rational the statement 
said 
we must present reasons for our proposals which can be 
understood and appreciated by people of good will who may not share 
our convictions 
indeed we see respect for human life born and unborn as a 
demand which our common humanity makes on all of us for other human 
goods lose their meaning when the value of life itself is demeaned 
or diminished 
the statement said the humanity of the unborn child is being 
obscured by arguments over privacy and personal autonomy adding 
that americans have just begun to see that a right to life 
precedes fetal viability 
prior to viability a child depends for survival on the 
protection of his or her mothers womb the statement said in 
other contexts however our society rightly sees dependency upon 
others as evidence of a need for more care and concern not as a 
pretext for denying rights to the helpless

rejecting the thesis that jews 
have their own valid covenant with god the lausanne ii 
international congress on world evangelization said jews need jesus 
as much as anyone else 
in a manifesto the congress of about 4000 evangelicals from 
around the globe declared 
it would be a form of antisemitism as well as being disloyal 
to christ to depart from the new testament pattern of taking the 
gospel to the jew first 
the manifesto appproved near the close of the 10day congress 
july 20 added we wish to be sensitive to those of other faiths 
and we reject any approach that seeks to force conversion on them 
repentance was expressed for past attitudes of ignorance 
arrogance disrespect and even hostility toward those of other 
faiths 
but the manifesto rejects both the relativism that regards all 
religions and spiritualities as equally valid approaches to god and 
the syncretism that tries to mix faith in christ with other faiths 
asserting the uniqueness of christ the manifesto says 
there is only one gospel because there is only one christ who 
because of his death and resurrection is himself the only way to 
salvation

when he was young gendengun nyamdoo would 
start his day galloping on horseback over the vast plains of western 
mongolia these days he starts his day poring over the real estate 
ads in the washington post 
nyamdoo mongolias first ambassador to the united states is 
looking for an embassy building and residence befitting his ancient 
nation which gave rise to the 13th century warrior genghis khan 
his country sandwiched between china and the soviet union has 
been synonymous with remoteness and isolation for hundreds of years 
no more mongolia is making its debut on washingtons diplomatic 
stage with an ambassador who is not your typical stiff upper 
lip diplomat 
when he went to present his credentials to president bush three 
months ago nyamdoo took along his infant grandson he and his wife 
care for the baby and there was nowhere to leave him nyamdoo 
said in an interview 
he drives his own car a chauffeur is not in the budget yet 
and lives in a belle epoque apartment house that has seen better 
days his deputy lives in an adjacent apartment and the living 
quarters are also used as offices 
but nyamdoo is sufficiently savvy to have learned one of the 
first rules of washington success a lobbyist is a virtual must he 
has retained the firm of van kloberg and associates to help him get 
settled introduce him around town and promote investment in 
mongolia 
his english has the distinct rolling intonation of a russian 
accent the legacy of five years of university in moscow where he 
studied international law the subject of his doctoral desertation 
was one he knows well landlocked countries 
mongolia once the seat of a warrior empire that extended to the 
shores of the danube river established diplomatic relations with 
the united states in 1987 it was high time nyamdoo said in an 
interview 
about 100 other countries have diplomatic ties with mongolia 
which became the worlds second communist nation when it declared 
independence in 1924 but only about 20 maintain resident 
ambassadors there the us ambassador richard williams works at 
the state department and occasionally travels to visit several 
junior american diplomats who brave the harsh climate and lack of 
western comforts to live and work in ulan bator the capital 
nyamdoo and his five brothers and sisters grew up on a farm in 
the western part of the country which spans an area the size of 
western europe but whose population is only 2 million 
i miss the rural life said the 55yearold envoy we had 
five treasures horses cattle camels sheep and goats 
in those days it was easy for a bright youth to get a high 
school and university education he said mongolia had styled itself 
on the soviet model of centralized economic planning and a free 
education for all 
nowadays with 70 percent of the population under the age of 30 
and shrinking soviet aid competition for university slots is 
tougher nyamdoo said 
mongolia has its version of perestroika and glasnost the soviet 
policies of economic restructuring and political openness but in 
ulan bator its called shinechel or renewal 
you can say we have more freedom than in the united states 
now nyamdoo said with a laugh 
the opening to the united states paralleled improving relations 
between mongolia and its giant neighbor to the south china 
relations between beijing and ulan bator were ruptured in the late 
1950s when mongolia sided with the soviet union in its split with 
china but the recent thaw in sinosoviet relations encompassed the 
mongolians as well 
in 1984 nyamdoo was part of a mongolian foreign ministry team 
that drafted an agreement with china to start normalizing relations 
here in washington he meets with his chinese counterpart as well as 
with ambassador williams who is also in charge of the state 
departments china office 
nyamdoo would like more us recognition of his country 
specifically through a meeting between his foreign minister and 
secretary of state james baker the level of diplomatic relations 
is too low now he said 
us officials characterize the relationship as modest but off to 
a good start 
trade with the united states runs at about 3 million annually 
mostly mongolian exports of cashmere and wool hundreds of american 
hunters go on safaris to hunt rams in the frozen wastelands of the 
gobi desert 
nyamdoo would like us investment in mongolia possibly in the 
form of joint ventures already a team representing petroleum 
companies visited mongolia this summer to examine the prospects for 
oil exploration in the mineralrich country he said 
but for nyamdoo the most pressing need is an embassy building 
his efforts are complicated by a standoff with the state department 
over land for a us chancery in ulan bator 
in accordance with diplomatic practice mongolia cannot set up an 
embassy here until the united states gets the land for its chancery 
in ulan bator 
but the state department has picked out a lot used by a mongolian 
naturalist society and refuses to settle for another space nyamdoo 
said i am stubborn too we will see he said

the mighty mississippi once carried cargo and cotton and damsels 
and dandies up and down the lazy river now iowans are betting these 
waters will deliver them another precious commodity greenbacks 
iowa known more for hogs than high rollers is moving to revive 
riverboat gambling hoping the romance of the past will generate 
riches for the future and its not alone 
across americas heartland several states are planning or 
considering gambling ventures to try to bring dollars jobs and 
tourists into struggling industrial cities and small towns hit hard 
this decade by factory closings the farm depression and the exodus 
of jobs and people 
if we were still doing well and had not turned into the great 
rust belt you would not see this great influx of gambling in the 
guise of economic development said state sen denny jacobs a key 
supporter of riverboat gambling in illinois its a nice stopgap 
until we can readjust ourselves and get back on two solid feet 
soon there will be wagers in the land of wild bill hickok the 
gold rush town of deadwood sd theres gambling talk too in 
indiana missouri and wisconsin 
thats not to suggest there arent skeptics and critics some 
argue the stakes are too low to be an economic salvation the sites 
too hohum or bleak for tourism 
others fear games of chance will erode the american gothic ethic 
when gambling comes in all of the other social crimes 
increase said owen primavera spokesman for the iowa alliance 
against casino gambling it increases loan sharking it increases 
drug traffic and prostitution 
supporters insist they intend to create family entertainment 
those traditional midwest heartland values are still going 
to be there said larry reed executive vice president of the 
davenport chamber of commerce in iowa 
the only change proponents say is the midwest will being doing 
more to strut its stuff 
the mississippi is well known worldwide said don rinehart 
executive vice president of the river city chamber of commerce in 
iowa its a gold mine in our backyard and we havent taken 
advantage of it 
its all right to be homespun jacobs said thats part of 
the charm of the midwest but it may be time we get a little more 
sophisticated 
and gambling seems a logical step with the increasing popularity 
of bingo lotteries and horse and dog tracks in north dakota for 
example a record 205 million was wagered on games of chance last 
year including pull tabs blackjack and bingo 
more than 30 states have lotteries and more than 40 have 
parimutuel betting said william thompson a university of 
nevadalas vegas management and public administration professor and 
coauthor of a book on casinos 
theres more to come 
in deadwood sd there will be poker blackjack and slot 
machines probably in october voters this spring approved gambling 
city proceeds will go to historic preservation in this once 
riproaring black hills town where hickoks last poker game ended 
with a bullet in his head 
what were really doing is returning to our past and saying 
thats really our future said bill walsh coowner of a local 
hotel 
in gary ind a struggling steel capital on lake michigan 
voters will be asked in a nonbinding november referendum whether 
they want resort hotels with casino gambling supporters of casino 
gambling in lorain ohio say they are not giving up despite failing 
to get enough signatures to put the issue on the november ballot in 
1988 detroit rejected casinos for the third time in 12 years 
in illinois wisconsin and missouri some lawmakers want to 
mimic iowa and put riverboats and other floating casinos on parts of 
the great lakes the mississippi and other waterways 
the illinois house in june rejected such a plan but a task force 
has since been formed to study the issue so lawmakers can reconsider 
it in the fall 
many illinois officials are eager to put paddlewheelers in the 
water before iowa which doesnt start riverboat gambling until 
april 1991 iowa requires county referendums before gambling can 
begin in each local area 
iowa gov terry branstad has proposed creating a regional agency 
to monitor riverboat gambling on the states boundary waters 
the lure of big tourist bucks is particularly appealing to 
mississippi river towns in both states which have lost thousands of 
manufacturing jobs in the last decade 
iowa has estimated gambling on its rivers and lakes could 
generate 17 billion in spinoffs from tourism and new business 
theres concern though riverboats could cut into the bingo and 
racing profits 
further reed said at some point you reach a saturation 
point if iowa has it illinois and wisconsin the impact of it 
for any individual state is going to be diluted 
some experts say iowas riverboat project already is in trouble 
because of a 5 limit per bet 200 cap on nightly losses and 20 
percent casino revenue tax that will make it harder to reap a profit 
iowa has produced an unworkable bill that will probably result 
in naught daniel lee senior analyst at drexel burnham lambert 
inc said in a report 
he added in a telephone interview theyre going to throw a 
party no one will go to 
especially some say if its far away 
people from around the country are not going to travel to iowa 
to spend 5 on riverboat gambling said professor thompson 
everything that is good about it lends itself to being small 
but if its small its not going to add much to the economy 
but local folks insist theyre not expecting miracles 
i dont think anybody has touted riverboat gambling as the 
answer to their economic woes rinehart said its like chicken 
soup it cant hurt and it looks like it could help its just 
another piece of ammunition to lure people 
thats also what deadwood hopes to do 
theres no other way we could think of to raise money said 
melodee nelson head of the deadwood you bet committee deadwood 
is sitting 45 miles from a major airport 15 miles from the 
interstate no industry is going to come to deadwood 
but big cities that have industry and are looking for gambling to 
reverse their fortunes also face obstacles said john dombrink 
associate social ecology professor at the university of 
californiairvine and thompsons coauthor 
its kind of pollyannish to think a bluecollar industrial city 
is somehow tailormade for a tourist industry he said 
tourism is not like a nose job where one day you can wave a 
wand it might take a long time for peoples perceptions to 
change 
but some in gary ind believe the scenic lakefront and 
proximity to chicago will make the city an ideal casino site 
despite its problems with shuttered stores a bleak downtown and a 
shrinking workforce 
i think its garys last shot at an economic development 
project that will deliver in the magnitude the steel mills once 
delivered on said state rep earline rogers a supporter 
nothing else weve looked at will revitalize gary in the same 
manner if casino gambling cant do it nothing can

this town population 945 will try for a 
riverboat gambling license so will dubuque with more than 60 times 
as many people 
i think theres a possibility of us getting a license but i 
think its an uphill battle said mcgregor chamber of commerce 
official charlie zahn personally speaking i think it stinks 
the northeast iowa communities about 60 miles apart on the 
mississippi river are two of the iowa towns that plan to apply for 
licenses from the state racing and gaming commission following 
approval of riverboat gambling in local referendums last week 
there is no limit on the number of licenses that could be issued 
but observers expect no more than three some say only one will 
be issued for the first year 
on paper dubuque would appear to have an overwhelming edge the 
city boasts many tourism attractions highlighted by mississippi 
river boat tours and the first dog track granted a parimutuel 
license when gambling was legalized in iowa four years ago 
but mcgregor officials concede nothing 
their own attractions include a 970acre park named for zebulon 
pike a series of 191 preserved prehistoric indian burial grounds 
and thousands of acres for hunting and camping officials felt 
confident enough of obtaining a riverboat gambling license to hire a 
contractor to build a boat dock for about 500000 
mcgregor is a halfmile stretch of restaurants antique shops 
taverns and other stores nestled between forested bluffs overlooking 
the river 
being a smaller community i think its only fair that we 
should have an opportunity like this rather than everything going 
to the big urban areas said mcgregor city clerk norm lincoln 
dubuque has a different argument for the gaming commission 
there is a point thats reached where theres too many people 
in too small a geographic region all trying to do the same thing i 
think a fullfledged operation like we plan in dubuque and a 
fullbore operation very close to us such as mcgregor might be a 
little bit much said don hess a spokesman for the dubuque racing 
association the nonprofit group seeking a license 
hess also director of marketing and communications at dubuque 
greyhound park said five dog tracks are due to open in neighboring 
wisconsin potentially cutting attendance and revenue in iowa 
were hoping to secure a riverboat gambling license to get a 
floating casino out on the mississippi so we can have two major 
tourism draws that will allow us to bring back some of these people 
that well be losing to wisconsin 
a floating casino could mean 300 jobs and an extra 100 million a 
year to the local economy hess said 
in mcgregor officials feel the state almost owes them a license 
to compensate for lost taxes on thousand of acres around town 
purchased by the iowa department of natural resources 
mcgregors never going to land the big industry and the 
economics are such that well probably never see a dog track or 
horse track mayor robyn denning said we just never seem to get 
our fair share of whats going on

the hot crowded bus stopped at a 
dirt road jose joel martinez freshly deported from the united 
states stepped down and started walking the final dusty mile to 
his parents concretewalled house 
he didnt know how long it would be safe to stay 
martinez 20 returned to civilian life this spring after four 
years in el salvadors army but the civil war followed him home 
and guerrillas warned him to leave or his life would be in danger 
i dont know whether it is safe for me to return martinez 
said looking at the mountain range just to the north where combat 
recently had intensified between government troops and the leftist 
guerillas ill have to see how things are 
the journey home is a familiar one lately in el salvador 
deportations of salvadorans from texas which increased dramatically 
after a us crackdown designed to plug off a flood of central 
americans totaled more than 1100 in the first half of the year 
on feb 21 the immigration and naturalization service abruptly 
ended its policy of allowing central americans to travel beyond 
texas to other us destinations for temporary residence by 
january new asylum applicants were pouring into southern texas at a 
rate of 500 a day the ins began ruling on applications the day they 
were filed those denied were held in detention camps until 
deportation 
only six salvadorans were granted asylum in texas from feb 21 to 
the end of july 
martinez said he didnt even bother to apply people told him it 
would only mean longer detention before he was deported 
martinezs homecoming prompted smiles from neighbors as he passed 
on a road lined with barbed wire and dotted with occasional piles of 
cattle dung 
todo tranquilo aqui everything calm here maria emilina 
anderson told martinez when he asked about any local fighting 
chickens scattered minutes later as he turned down a narrow path 
stopped at a cinderblock house and shouted to a smiling woman who 
was hanging laundry on a rope hello lito is back too 
martinez told litos mother he will visit sunday after a 
reunion with his wife and newborn baby in san miguel the provincial 
capital 
lito his nextdoor neighbor and fellow exsoldier was deported 
on the same taca international airlines flight that had carried 
martinez from houston the day before out of work and threatened by 
the guerrillas lito had left for el norte a few weeks before 
martinez made his trip in may 
he and martinez found each other at the ins detention camp 
northeast of brownsville texas 
the food and the bed were better there in us detention than 
i have at home and it is airconditioned martinez said but i 
was a prisoner it was my first time ever to be a prisoner 
he left for the united states on may 3 and slipped across the rio 
grande at brownsville on may 14 four days later he was in ins 
custody having made the mistake of presenting himself to the border 
patrol to ask permission to stay and work in the united states 
he was held at the crowded ins detention camp six weeks wearing 
the standard orange jumpsuit and blue canvas slippers and playing 
soccer and basketball with other detainees 
many salvadorans applying for asylum say they are fleeing la 
situacion a combination of civil war and unemployment 
exacerbated by war the nineyear conflict has claimed 70000 lives 
mostly civilians and displaced 500000 to 1 million people 
those able to prove they are fleeing persecution get asylum and 
permission to work in the united states but us officials say most 
central americans come for economic reasons 
among salvadorans in the united states it is not hard to find 
exsoldiers who say they were threatened by guerillas 
immigration to the united states has increased much by soldiers 
who have completed military service said the rev segundo montes 
a jesuit priest and director of the human rights institute at 
central american university in san salvador they dont want to 
return to their houses or their towns because they are afraid 
in conflict zones guerillas might consider exsoldiers public 
officials and their families to be ears for the government and 
tell them to leave montes said 
if they do not leave there comes a time when they as they 
say bring them to justice they kill them montes said 
that type of justice is still more typical of the army he added 
but the guerrillas i believe have increased a little this type 
of repression against the civilian population 
martinez spent a good part of the flight to el salvador quiet and 
absorbed in violent reports of the civil war in a salvadoran 
newspaper left on the plane he did not join in the idle clowning of 
some of the 59 central american deportees taking up the rear half of 
the airliner on seats for which the us government paid 288 per 
oneway ticket 
when he arrived at his rural home near the town of chapeltique 
martinez mother maria angela sorto was cooking over a wood fire 
in the houses tiny smokeblackened kitchen she stepped out to 
greet him with a grin of relief 
thank god you returned she said it worries me when you 
are so far away 
he took off his shirt and ate the small plate of eggs rice and 
thick corn tortillas his mother served with a plastic tumbler of 
cool water from the well 
his father ernesto martinez was bathing in the river down a 
hill behind the house towel slung over his shoulder he returned as 
jose joel ate and warmly greeted his son 
the house has electricity but no running water a tree trunk in 
the middle of the floor holds up a red clay roof a hammock is the 
principal piece of furniture 
on one concrete wall ernesto martinez had written in chalk the 
date his son left for the united states 
the father said things had been calm locally but that the week 
before in a battle 25 miles to the north four of jose joels army 
buddies had been killed the younger martinez stunned pulled from 
a shelf a pile of photographs showing him in battle fatigues with 
two of the dead drinking hot pepper sauce as part of toughness 
training 
an hour later several soldiers fingersontriggers marched by 
the house on patrol 
the next morning martinez said he would try to get work at the 
jute farm where his father earns 10 colones 2 a day 
if i had been able to work in the united states he said i 
could have lived in a place with a bed and a mattress 
later he added maybe i will return to the united states

a surge in earlyaugust car and truck sales may be 
an indication that consumers are shying away from waiting for this 
falls 1990 model cars and the higher prices they will be carrying 
figures released tuesday by the eight major automakers with us 
assembly plants showed that car and truck sales during the aug 110 
period rose 82 percent over the same period last year car sales 
were up 74 percent and truck sales rose 94 percent 
late 1989 model cars may be looking more attractive to consumers 
who have heard recent news of tentative price increases by the big 
three automakers ranging from 34 percent to 5 percent for 1990 
models 
the increased sales also may have been fueled by manufacturers 
incentives which have been around in some form since early april 
when asked if he thought some consumers planning to buy a 1990 
car had decided to beat the price increases by purchasing a late 
1989 model analyst ron glantz said flatly i hope so 
i think in all probability there are people buying a little 
earlier than usual but not many said glantz of montgomery 
securities inc in san francisco 
he said that later this month and next month as the 1989 model 
year draws to a close more people may decide to buy now rather than 
wait for later 
we havent had any dealer advertisements yet saying beat the 
price increase they should start soon he said 
general motors corp said its tentative prices will be about 34 
percent above 1898 levels ford motor co said its prices will jump 
about 48 percent and chrysler corps 1990 prices will be about 5 
percent more than in 1989 
the companies said some of the increases are due to governmental 
requirements that they install passive restraint systems air bags 
or automatic seat belts in 1990 model cars 
lets face it the consumer wont pay for safety glantz said 
the wild card in late 1989 and early 1990 model year sales 
promises to be incentives automakers and some dealers would like to 
get rid of them but consumers are used to being told how big a 
rebate theyll get if they drive away in a new car now 
they manufacturers are filing for pretty big price 
increases said analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc 
in new york but whether they will be realworld prices or just 
on paper to be superseded with rebates is a good question 
i think they will wait for about 15 minutes see that sales are 
slow and come out with rebates 
the incentives are designed to give sales a boost but they 
havent done the kind of job this year as they have in the past 
from jan 1 through aug 10 car and truck sales were 36 percent 
behind last years pace falling to an average daily rate of 38063 
from a rate of 39500 in the yearago period car sales were off 48 
percent and truck sales were down 15 percent

home shopping network inc pitches 
cookware and jewelry to millions of tv viewers but the video 
retailers more important audience is a judge who will rule on its 
appeal of a 100 million libel award 
the financially ailing company which could be devastated by such 
a large forfeiture is seeking to reverse or reduce the jury award 
granted gte corp earlier this month 
in an earlier lawsuit of its own hsn had accused gte of 
installing an inadequate telephone system at the retailers 
clearwater headquarters which it blamed for missed calls from 
viewers and the loss of millions of dollars worth of sales 
but the case boomeranged on hsn when gte successfully 
countersued claiming that its reputation was smeared by hsns 
accusations which it called false 
the hsn appeal awaiting state circuit judge howard rives when he 
returns from vacation later this month alleges 336 faults in the 
sixweek case ranging from improper evidence to rives demeanor 
described as grumpy 
the aug 2 verdict was grossly excessive and was the product of 
prejudice passion and gross confusion said hsn in its appeal 
motions filed monday 
much of the appeal focuses on rives decision to permit gtes 
libel counterclaim to be heard in the same trial as the 15 billion 
hsn suit rives also is accused of prejudicing jurors against hsn 
and its attorneys 
gte spokeswoman jan morris declined to comment on the motions 
but said the stamford connbased telecommunications giant would 
answer the challenges in court 
a hearing on the appeal before rives has been set for nov 28 
this promises to go on for months said hsn spokewoman kathy 
jurado we said all along well try to get this overturned 
nonetheless some people familiar with the case speculate that 
gte may be interested in settling the matter by working out a lower 
settlement with hsn which claimed it lost 500 million in sales 
when gtes telephone system could not handle an increasing volume of 
calls in 1986 and 1987 
gte executives also were accused of trying to hide the problem 
from hsn which now uses mci communications corp telephones 
gte is in a very strong bargaining position said james 
stork an analyst with the chicago investment firm duff amp phelps 
inc this is really not a large amount of money for a company like 
gte they might just make some sort of deal to end it 
in closing trial arguments gte attorney roy reardon said the 
company only wanted to clear its name and did not want to devastate 
hsn with a huge award i didnt come down here to look for 
money he told the jury 
the judgement one of the highest ever awarded in a libel case 
struck the 7yearold video retail pioneer at a bad time 
hsn reported slumping sales and a 59 million loss for the 
quarter ended may 31 for all of 1988 the company reported a profit 
of 18 million on sales of 730 million its stock which surged to 
47 a share in mid1987 bottomed out at 3 a share hours after the 
jury verdict 
meanwhile two of hsns principal competitors plan to merge next 
month cvn cos of minneapolis and qvc network of west chester pa 
say their combined sales will knock hsn from the top spot in video 
retailing for the first time 
some legal experts said hsns best option is to aggressively 
appeal the libel ruling floyd abrams a libellaw specialist said 
he believed the facts of the case did not support the huge award 
if there is no evidence that gte suffered damages as the result 
of the libel it will be difficult for the damage verdict to be 
sustained because of its elephantine nature he said 
however abrams noted that the award even if knocked down 
could encourge more companies to file libel suits in cases of rumors 
or common corporate badmouthing in the hope that other juries are 
equally generous 
earlier this month american express co admitted its 
representatives circulated false stories claiming that international 
banker edmond safra an amex competitor was tied to money 
laundering american express opted for an 8 million settlement 
rather that risk a possible libel battle in court

stockholders this week says lorenzo received salary and bonuses of 
977225 and relocation compensation of 275000

unions texas air also owns continental airlines which went through 
bankruptcy reorganization in 1983 during similar labor strife

integrated resources inc the struggling 
financial concern plans to sell its core assets in another 
restructuring effort to emerge from under a 175 billion mountain 
of debt 
integrated said tuesday it was trying to sell key subsidiaries 
including its two life insurance companies its investment products 
distributor and its asset management business to prevent the spread 
of its financial woes 
we recognized that if we dont do something to take the 
insurance companies and some of the other companies away from the 
problems of the parent company we were going to have more 
deteriorations integrateds cochief executive arthur goldberg 
said in an interview 
integrated which in june halted payments on the shortterm 
portion of its debt projected a 600 million loss for the quarter 
ended june 30 and said that sales of its investment products have 
declined and withdrawals have increased 
the latest restructuring proposal was greeted with no enthusiasm 
on wall street where integrated stock lost 75 cents to close at 2 
and some of the new york firms bonds fell sharply in new york stock 
exchange trading 
standard amp poors corp lowered integrateds credit rating 
tuesday citing the secondquarter loss forecast and the firms 
announcement that it would not be able to pay interest on 12 
percent notes due aug 15 
sampp also cast doubt on the new plan saying that significant 
uncertainty exists with regard to the success of any restructuring 
plan some bondholders said the firms reduced asset base after 
the subsidiary sales would lower its earnings ability 
integrated said it valued the financial services companies at 
450 million to 525 million and that sale proceeds would be used to 
meet obligations to senior debt holders it said the firms total 
assets were worth 117 billion to 125 billion compared with 
175 billion in total debt 
the latest restructuring replaces one announced in late june that 
included 300 million in financing from its longtime adviser 
drexel burnham lambert inc 
integrated officials met with bondholders tuesday to discuss the 
latest plan which emerged after the firm decided it couldnt 
support the debt level in the first refinancing 
integrateds june default on 955 million in shortterm 
commercial paper capped a steady demise for the once highflying 
real estate and insurance concern whose stock nosedived from much 
as 40 a share in 1986 and 16 a share in late may 
after the spinoff of subsidiaries integrateds main businesses 
would be managementof existing public and private limited 
partnerships and real estate investment trusts it says it wont 
sell any new products until at least next year 
integrateds other cochief executive stephen weinroth on 
monday took a leave of absence from drexel where he is managing 
director of corporate finance weinroth has been on integrateds 
board since 1983 and was elected chairman aug 1 and cochief 
executive saturday 
integrated said that if the sale of the subsidiaries falls 
through it will spin them off to its senior debt holders 
the subsidiaries are integrated resources life insurance co of

despite the fare wars and safety fears sometimes 
choosing which airline to fly boils down to the peanuts 
airline officials say amenities ranging from snack packs to full 
cans of soft drink are a top priority even in this age of cutrate 
tickets and scaledback service 
if we ever run out of peanuts they passengers are quite 
perturbed said mary oneill a spokeswoman for american airlines 
in fort worth texas they expect a little munchie with their 
flight 
and if the munchies run short 
if theyre very mad the flight attendant may ask another 
passenger to voluntarily give their peanuts up ms oneill said 
although airline advertisements in this age of deregulation focus 
on low fares and convenient schedules most fliers still apparently 
expect to get their freebies which of course are not really free 
most amenities are built into the cost of a ticket 
bill jackman a spokesman for the washingtonbased airline 
industry organization air transport association said major us 
carriers expect to spend about 2 billion this year on food service 
he said he was unsure how that would be divided between snacks and 
meals 
the importance of snacks drinks magazines toiletry kits and 
toy captains wings for the kids was underscored earlier this month 
in the usair merger with piedmont airlines piedmont traditionally 
served passengers a full can of soda while usair provided only a 
cup of the drink 
the merged airline decided to adopt the fullcan practice to 
avoid miffed passengers 
let me put it this way said edwin i colodny chairman and 
president of usair group inc there will be no complaints on the 
cocacola service 
jackman said complimentary service dates to the beginning of the 
commercial airline industry when carriers would fill seats with 
their own employees to reduce anxiety among passengers afraid of the 
thennew form of travel 
in the early days there was widespread fear of flying 
jackman said all kinds of inducements were offered 
jackman said efforts to comfort passengers evolved into free 
snacks and cocktails and hit its heyday in the 1970s when airline 
regulation standardized fares and the companies had to provide 
something to distinguish their service 
those were the days of piano bars complimentary champagne and 
platters of roast beef sliced at your seat jackman said one airline 
hired an aerobics instructor to demonstrate exercises in the aisle 
in the days prior to deregulation when everything fares was 
the same you had to differentiate by onboard service theyd go to 
great lengths to describe their food he said 
one of the bestknown children of deregulation that tried to make 
it without freebies people express failed after a few years 
inflight goodies vary among airlines and are more extensive as 
the passenger class rises the most common items are soft drinks and 
peanuts 
pan americans business class passengers get a mixed snack pack 
including nuts pretzels and sesame sticks instead of just peanuts 
said pamela hanlon a spokeswoman in new york they also receive 
complimentary cocktails or wine and an amenities kit containing 
toothpaste hand lotion and other toiletries 
on dinner flights frequent fliers get to choose meals from a 
menu of about nine items ms hanlon said 
certainly in first class or business class that does make a 
difference she said of the complimentary items i think its 
part of the decision of which airline to fly 
advances in technology and changing social customs also have 
influenced airline handouts 
jim lundy spokesman for delta air lines said many airlines used 
to distribute complimentary minipacks of cigarettes and matches to 
passengers that stopped when smoking became less acceptable 
in the old days before cabins were pressurized the airlines gave 
passengers a stick of chewing gum to help equalize the pressure in 
their ears 
those seemingly little things make a strong impression on 
consumers said naresh malhotra professor and coordinator of 
marketing and management science at georgia tech in atlanta 
the consumer is buying a bundle of benefits rather than just 
the basic transportation malhotra said 
theres symbolic value in that the consumer feels hes being 
treated in the right manner and on longer flights it becomes 
necessary youve got to have something to eat youve got to have 
something to drink he said

atlantic richfield co plans to market a 
leadfree gasoline for older cars and trucks that use leaded gas and 
said the new fuel could cut pollution from such vehicles by up to 15 
percent 
the gasoline will go on sale next month at 750 arco stations in 
southern california for about the same price as leaded regular 
gasoline arco said tuesday 
the announcement came the same day the california air resources 
board unanimously adopted a sweeping 20year plan to clean southern 
californias air the nations dirtiest it will transform the way 
californians work and play 
arcos new gasoline was created to reduce pollution caused by the 
estimated 12 million worstpolluting vehicles in the region cars 
made before 1975 and trucks built before 1980 
arcos refinery in carson will produce the gasoline which is 
called ec1 for emission control1 and cost about 20 million to 
develop 
were making this heavy investment because we believe the 
dominant fuel of the future will be gasoline rather than the 
alternatives youve been hearing about said lodwrick m cook 
arco chairman and chief executive officer those alternatives 
include methanol and natural gas 
what we hope to demonstrate today is that we can clean up 
gasoline cook said 
the fuel has an octane level of 88 and contains methyl tertiary 
butyl ether which arco spokesman al greenstein described as an 
oxygenated additive 
the mtbe is what makes up for the loss of octane by eliminating 
the lead he said its something thats on the market that 
wasnt available a few years ago 
arco officials said the fuel reduces chemical components that 
cause smog by about onethird and benzene a cancercausing 
pollutant by half the fuelsulfur content was reduced by 80 
percent 
were pleased that arco has taken the initiative in developing 
a new gasoline that is more environmentally acceptable and which 
reflects the direction of the air resources boards future 
regulation said board chairwoman jananne sharpless 
the board tuesday voted 80 to adopt the smogcontrol plan 
despite industry objections the plan will strangle the regions 
economy it will target emissions from everything from motor 
vehicles factories and auto paint to dry cleaners bakeries 
aerosol cans and backyard grills 
the plan embraces landuse planning transportation programs and 
stricter industry standards it was completed in march by the south 
coast air quality management district and the southern california 
association of governments 
regional air quality officials estimate that the plan will cost 
26 billion a year business interests say annual costs will reach 
12 billion 
enactment was hailed as a leap into a brave new world by 
harriet wieder an orange county supervisor on the ninemember air 
resources board 
the plan was branded texas justice by william t huston a 
developer leading a coalition of business and labor interests 
fighting to revise the plane theyre acting as their own judge 
jury and executioner he said 
arco is working on another blend that will be sold elsewhere in 
the west the company said arco stations are in five western 
states california washington oregon arizona and nevada 
when asked if arco was pushed or jumped to develop the 
alternative to leaded fuel cook said a little of both but if 
there are cleaner fuels to be burned well be producing those too

the air line pilots association has told its 
united airlines members they have difficult choices ahead amid 
reports the union and the carrier are considering plans including an 
employeeowned stake in the company 
alpa chairman rick dubinsky said in a letter to union members 
tuesday that uniteds parent ual corp which has received a 54 
billion 240ashare takeover proposal from investor marvin davis 
undoubtedly will be bought out by somebody 
in fact whether you like it or not you and all the other 
employees are going to help pay for it dubinsky said the only 
choice is whether we buy it for someone else or ourselves 
he said united pilots may have to act rapidly decisively and 
conclusively to assure our survival and prosperity noting 
acquisition by an outsider likely would mean a leveraged buyout that 
could saddle the company with loads of new debt 
we must watch this situation very closely insuring that we 
have all the information we need to make the difficult choices that 
are inevitable dubinsky said 
ual stock closed 425 lower at 25425 a share on the new york 
stock exchange 
several news reports indicated alpa and ual officials met during 
the weekend to discuss a plans for either a managementemployee 
buyout or recapitalization that would put a big enough block of ual 
stock in an employee stock ownership plan to help block any hostile 
takeover attempt 
spokesmen for ual and alpa refused to comment tuesday on whether 
meetings were held during the weekend or on reports of the purported 
plans 
theres nothing out there to make me feel tremendously 
uncomfortable said john peterpaul vice president of the 
international association of machinists referring to the reported 
discussions on a buyout plan were sitting here watching it 
the machinists union represents mechanics at united and other 
airlines the third union representing united employees the 
association of flight attendants did not return phone calls seeking 
comment 
dubinsky said in his letter that the level of contribution to any 
esop plan by the pilots would depend on the number of employees and 
employee groups participating 
depending on the declared interest of the other employees we 
may need a great level of participation or a slight level his 
letter read it would make good sense for you to be financially 
prepared for the worst 
uniteds pilots in the past have expressed an interest in buying 
the company and in 1987 proposed a 45 billion plan to buy the 
airline from its thenparent allegis corp last week alpa officials 
said its advisers were being consulted about the davis bid 
in addition to davis new yorkbased pan am corp has expressed 
interest in a possible merger with ual 
louis marckesano an analyst with janney montgomery scott inc 
said a deal involving ual management and its employees would 
eliminate fears in congress and the department of transportation 
that the airline would be stripped of valuable assets as might 
happen with a leveraged buyout 
a leveraged buyout is an acquisition financed mainly by borrowed 
funds that are repaid with the target companys cash flow or the 
sale of its assets 
with that kind of plan you would assure continuation of ual as 
a strong airline he said referring to a managementlabor buyout 
it would create labor peace which would be pretty important in 
the future

gaming analysts believe resorts 
international inc will have to make a dramatic move to pull out of 
its financial slump 
on tuesday one day after resorts posted a large secondquarter 
loss the conclusions were near unanimous 
they have got to recapitalize in some way shape or form 
said saul leonard a los angelesbased analyst with laventhol amp 
horwath 
with two gaming halls selling one might be a very viable 
alternative he said 
resorts blamed its secondquarter losses on slower casino

merv griffin the entertainer who purchased the company last year 
from developer donald trump 
state gaming regulators will hold hearings next month to consider 
whether resorts has enough financial stability to change griffins 
interim authorization into a license 
resorts based here will have to pay more than 130 million in 
interest and principal this year but its operations likely will not 
generate enough money to cover that in 1988 the companys cash 
flow was only 602 million 
according to figures issued monday resorts posted a 279 
million net loss for the second quarter of 1989 compared to a 138 
million net loss for the same period in 1988 
for the first six months of 1989 the company reported a net loss 
of 466 million compared to a 176 million net loss for last 
years first half

industrial production rose a moderate 02 
percent in july but the factory operating rate remained flat the 
federal reserve board said today in a report that indicated further 
easing of inflationary pressures 
factory use held steady at 836 percent last month after 
declining 03 percentage point in june the central bank said the 
rate hit a 10year high of 843 percent last december last months 
operating rate was down from 837 percent a year earlier 
the closer us industry gets to full operating capacity the 
greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand leading 
to shortages and price increases analysts generally consider an 
operating rate of 85 percent or above as an indication of 
inflationary pressures 
the central bank has been straddling a fine line of keeping 
interest rates high enough to cool inflationary pressures without 
slowing growth so much that the economy slides into a recession it 
began letting rates drop in june as inflation seemed to lessen 
the federal reserve said its industrial production index in july 
stood at 1417 percent of its 1977 base up from 1414 percent in 
june 
the 02 percent increase last month came after revised 01 
percent drops in both may and june those were the first downturns 
since the index fell 02 percent in february which had been the 
first drop in a year 
but the fed said the july gain mainly reflected a rebound in the 
output of raw materials and continued strength in business equipment 
excluding autos 
in contract automoobile and truck production fell sharply and 
output of construction supplies on balance remained weak it 
said 
production at manufacturing plants making both durable and 
nondurable goods rose 02 percent output was up 03 percent at 
mines and oil wells and 08 percent at utilities 
the factory operating rate dipped 01 percentage point to 839 
percent at manufacturing plants down from junes revised 84 
percent the rate had peaked at 847 percent in january 
the rate at factories producing durable goods bigticket items 
expected to last more than three years fell 03 percentage point 
from 826 percent in june 
the rate at factories producing nondurable goods rose to 862 
percent from 861 percent in june

of the merger agreement it expected to complete next month with 
torontobased varity corp 
kh formerly known as fruehauf corp said tuesday it notified 
varity a day earlier that it had not realized enough money from the 
july 14 sale of its trailer and maritime operations to terex corp 
to meet the agreement with varity fruehauf agreed in march to sell 
the operations to terex for about 233 million 
varity has 15 days to decide whether to go ahead with the merger 
kh spokesman david hladik said 
varity chairman victor rice wrote tuesday to kh estimating that 
khs shortfall was 25 million to 30 million and questioning how 
its earlier figure could be regarded even as a reasonable or good 
faith estimate 
rice said varity would continue studying the matter thats 
really all were going to say whats in the letter varity 
spokesman jr nowling said today 
fruehauf corp changed its name aug 4 to kh corp after the 
sale to terex kh corp president robert siefert said then the 
acquisition of kh by varity should be completed next month

up from 2865 million in the yearearlier period

2599 million on revenue of 6691 million compared with a loss of 
271 million on revenue of 5494 million in the first half of 1988

was attributable to sales of the trailer and maritime operations to 
terex corp

1986 when its managers avoided a hostile takeover by acquiring 
control in a debtfinanced buyout 
the sale of the trucktrailer and maritime operations to terex

japans ministry of transport asked northwest 
airlines wednesday to improve its servicing of planes at tokyos 
narita airport a ministry official said 
the ministry urged northwest to improve its maintenance because 
the airlines planes have been involved in many of the flight 
irregularities at narita in recent months the official said 
a large number of northwest flights have had to return to the 
airport or be diverted because of technical problems including 
engine malfunctions the official said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
northwest officials in tokyo could not be reached for comment 
immediately at the airlines eagan minn headquarters spokesman 
kevin whalen said officials there had not heard anything of the 
reported request and therefore could not comment in detail 
whalen said he was trying to reach northwest officials in japan 
but had been unsuccessful because it was late at night there 
japans kyodo news service quoted narita officials as saying 
northwest planes were involved in 16 of the 43 cases or 38 percent 
of flight irregularities at the airport so far this year 
kyodo said the 16 northwest irregularities this year included 12 
in which planes were forced to return to narita after takeoff and 
four in which planes were diverted mainly because of engine 
problems 
whalen said he could not say if those numbers were correct 
but we do have 22 departures a day from narita so were 
talking nearly 5300 departures so far this year and it would be a 
fraction of a percentage involving problems if those numbers are 
right he said 
united airlines had five flight irregularities the second 
largest number kyodo quoted the officials as saying 
united spokesman rob doughty said he could not immediately 
confirm that united had five flight irregularities this year at 
narita he said that to his knowledge japanese transportation 
officials had not asked united to improve its servicing of planes at 
the airport

a new agreement has been reached between the 
philippines and its creditor banks the second under the 
debtreduction proposals of treasury secretary nicholas f brady an 
international monetary source said today 
the source said the accord would both reduce the countrys 28 
billion debt and add new loans to it 
in last months agreement on the 108 billion debt of mexico a 
choice was given to creditor banks loan reductions interest 
reductions or new loans whether mexicos total debt will be larger 
or smaller remains to be worked out 
the source said the new agreement was reached in new york between 
representatives of the philippine government and a committee of 
banks led by manufacturers hanover trust co 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
international monetary fund last may offered the philippines about 
206 million in loans that the government of president corazon 
aquino could use for debt relief in the present state of the 
market the government can settle old loans for about 50 cents on 
the dollar 
the washington post which first reported the debt agreement 
cited treasury officials and bankers saying they dont consider the 
accord a break with the brady plan because it envisions that the 
philippines will try to reduce its indebtedness 
additional money for debt relief is expected from the world bank 
the funds sister organization in washington 
the money could also be used to reduce interest rates on the old 
loans the burden of interest payments is the heaviest part of the 
third worlds 13 trillion debt 
recent reports have said that the philippines was less interested 
in reduction of its debts to the commercial banks than in new loans 
from them jose fernandez head of the philippines central bank has 
been reported seeking 18 to 4 billion 
of the 28 billion the philippines already owes the bulk is held 
by governments and intergovernment bodies like the fund and world 
bank which have not permitted any reductions

eastern airlines trying to recover from a crippling 
strike and emerge from bankruptcy proceedings hopes to win back 
passengers by expanding its schedule and cutting fares 
but a union leader said tuesday the newly announced fare 
reductions by easterns competitors including trans world airlines 
pan american world airways united airlines american airlines and 
usair would hurt easterns efforts to rebuild 
the carrier on tuesday increased from 350 to 390 its daily 
flights by adding 40 flights connecting atlanta and destinations 
mostly in the south and said it would fly 600 daily flights as of 
sept 7 
easterns rebuilding plan calls for 800 daily flights by years 
end leaving the airline at about twothirds its size before its 
machinists pilots and flight attendants walked off the job and the 
carrier entered bankruptcy court proceedings in march 
eastern also announced discounted fares beginning sept 7 
including fares of 79 oneway between new york and florida and 129 
oneway between atlanta and the west coast the airline said the 
fares have fewer restrictions than the reduced fares announced this 
week by other major carriers and allow full refunds on unused 
tickets 
george brennan easterns vice president for marketing said the 
airline already planned new discounts before the other carriers and 
that easterns fall promotion offers tickets that are much easier 
to use and a much better value in most cases 
eastern will require three tosevenday advance purchase and its 
rates are available nearly every day and carry no restrictive 
penalties 
the fares are available to all domestic markets eastern said 
while eastern says it has hired enough pilots and is keeping up 
with maintenance despite its strike it has been leasing five planes 
and crews from its affiliated carrier continental airlines brennan 
said more planes and crews will be temporarily leased from 
continental 
eastern and continental are both subsidiaries of texas air corp 
eastern union leaders said the airlines claims to be coming back 
are misleading because their low fares make it impossible to make 
money 
machinists district 100 president charles e bryan said tuesday 
passengers are going to fly on other airlines because they are 
very reliable firstline carriers theyre not having phantom 
flights and people dont have to worry about losing their money 
if eastern tries to go even lower than the rest of the 
carriers thats just going to compound their problems its going 
to doom the rebuilding plan which was already doomed bryan said 
eastern before the march 4 strike usually had 1 billion in 
revenue per quarter in the second quarter eastern reported revenue 
of 896 million 
management hurdled a major barrier to its rebuilding efforts last 
week when a split in pilots union ranks resulted in at least 250 
more pilots returning to work boosting to 650 the number of union 
members that have crossed picket lines 
eastern said that with its own recruitment and training program 
it now has the 1700 pilots needed for its rebuilding plan

the countrys major bank creditors today announced a tentative 
agreement on a package of debt reduction the second pact to be 
reached under the bush administrations to new initiative 
philippine central bank governor jose b fernandez jr who led 
his countrys negotiating team said the tentative deal met the 
guidelines established by us treasury secretary nicholas brady in 
march

stock of commercial bank debt if we are to sustain the countrys 
economic growth he said at the same time new commerical bank

billion debt and also provide new loans the two elements the 
countrys negotiators had considered critical to keeping the 
philippine economy expanding 
the new debt package was the second agreement achieved under the 
brady debt plan which is seeking to get commercial banks to forgive 
a portion of their third world loans in exchange for guarantees of 
repayment of the remaining debt 
last month mexico the developing worlds second largest debtor 
with 108 billion owed reach an accord following the brady plans 
guidelines

loan reductions interest reductions or providing new money

representatives of the philippine government and a committee of 
banks led by manufacturers hanover trust co 
a source in washington who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the international monetary fund last may offered the philippines 
about 206 million in loans that the government of president corazon 
aquino could use for debt relief in the present state of the 
market the government can settle old loans for about 50 cents on 
the dollar 
the washington post which first reported the debt agreement 
cited treasury officials and bankers saying they dont consider the 
accord a break with the brady plan because it envisions that the 
philippines will try to reduce its indebtedness 
additional money for debt relief is expected from the world bank 
the funds sister organization in washington 
the money could also be used to reduce interest rates on the old 
loans the burden of interest payments is the heaviest part of the 
third worlds 13 trillion debt 
recent reports have said that the philippines was less interested 
in reduction of its debts to the commercial banks than in new loans 
from them fernandez has been reported seeking 18 to 4 billion 
of the 28 billion the philippines already owes the bulk is held 
by governments and intergovernment bodies like the fund and world 
bank which have not permitted any reductions

indictment of 46 futures traders in the city has created a 
permanent panel to monitor trading practices at the exchange

bell communications research said wednesday it 
has developed a prototype version of an inexpensive sensor for leaks 
from underground fuel tanks 
leaking fuel can contaminate wells and reservoirs and the 
environmental protection agency recently required that all 
underground fuel storage tanks be monitored for leaks by the end of 
1993 
bellcore said its sensor is made of a material that stops 
conducting electricity when it absorbs fuel when the electricity 
shuts off an alarm is triggered above ground 
bellcore based in livingston nj is the research arm of the 
seven regional bell telephone companies as well as cincinnati bell 
and southern new england telephone it developed the sensor for 
manholes because fuel leaking into them can endanger workers and 
damage cables 
the epa estimates there are leaks in more than 10 percent of the 
3 million to 5 million underground storage tanks for gasoline 
kerosene fuel oil and other hydrocarbon fuels across the country 
bellcore said it has applied for a patent and plans to license 
the technology by the end of the year to other companies including 
ones that could manufacture the sensors

the philips consumer electronics co has been 
awarded a contract valued at more than 150 million to make and 
install video hardware needed for whittle communications 
advertisingfinanced daily tv news program that debuts in schools 
next spring the companies announced today 
the contract calls for philips to design manufacture and install 
the communications systems needed for delivery of the channel one 
news service and other educational programming that whittle plans to 
make available to schools across the country beginning next march 
whittle has ordered about 300000 television sets 15000 
videocassette recorders and 8000 satellite dishes as part of its 
contract with philips 
whittle plans to give dozens of sets two vcrs and a satellite 
dish to each school that agrees to run the channel one news show 
with ads every day 
philips which is based in knoxville tenn where whittle also 
is headquartered said the order was the largest single order of 
satellite broadcasting systems it ever has received 
philips a subsidary of north american philips corp produces 
about 25 million televisions a year 
we wanted this system to be designed and manufactured by the 
best in the business weve got that said christopher whittle 
chairman of whittle communications 
philips said it plans to start building the 19inch color 
magnavox tv sets specified in the contract at its greeneville 
tenn plant in late 1989 it expects to add more than 200 
manufacturing employees at the facility 
philips has contracted with rsisatcom technologies division of 
duluth ga to manufacture the satellite dishes and install and 
service the tv sets vcrs and satellite systems in the schools 
whittle hopes to have 1000 schools hooked up at the national 
launch of channel one in march 1990 and 8000 schools by the end of 
1990 
philips was one of three companies that whittle previously said 
were under consideration for the technology contract 
the other contenders were japans sony corp and videostar 
connections a subsidiary of general motors corps electronic data 
systems corp 
atlantabased videostar had supplied installed and serviced the 
hardware for whittles sevenweek test of the channel one service in 
six schools last spring 
awarding the technology contract would enable whittle to reaffirm 
its proposed spring 1990 launch of channel one even as some 
advertising executives privately speculate that whittle is having 
trouble lining up sponsors and schools 
whittle executives have insisted their rollout plans are on 
schedule and are confident they will have a full lineup of sponsors 
and the 1000 schools signed by the spring startup 
the media concern plans to pay for producing the channel one news 
show and the equipment for schools by selling two minutes of 
advertising time on each 12minute program 
several national educational groups have decried allowing 
advertisers to pitch products to students while they are in class 
state education officials in new york have banned channel one from 
public schools and the top education official in california has said 
he will reduce state aid to public schools there that air it during 
the school day 
just this week turner broadcasting system inc stepped up the 
pressure on channel one by launching its own daily commercialfree 
news show designed for use in the classroom 
turners project however does not include the donations of 
video gear planned by channel one

the biggest computer failure in at least 12 years 
delayed most trading on the toronto stock exchange for three hours 
wednesday 
exchange officials said they suspected the problem originated in 
the cables feeding the system rather than a software failure 
all we know at the moment is that right at opening there was no 
information on the screens to work with exchange president pearce 
bunting said in a telephone interview shortly after the failure 
trading resumed shortly after 1230 pm edt 
because of a lack of stock price information no floor trading

international business machines corp said 
wednesday it would have unixbased operating software available for 
its most powerful computers early next year fulfilling a pledge 
made early last year 
ibm had said in march 1988 that within two years it would have 
unixbased software for its full range of computers 
unix is a base layer of software developed by american telephone 
amp telegraph co that theoretically enables many kinds of computers 
to run the same programs with little or no modification that is not 
actually possible because unix has become fragmented into many 
versions but efforts are under way to unify it 
ibms version of unix is called aix ibm said its aix for 
mainframe system 370 computers is already installed in 13 customer 
test sites

housing starts driven down for four months by 
high mortgage rates rose for the second straight month in july the 
government reported wednesday and analysts said singlefamily 
construction should continue at a moderate pace the rest of the year 
the interest rate drops in june definitely have begun to hit 
the market said john a tuccillo chief economist for the 
national association of realtors who predicted further interest 
rate declines will keep housing activity strong in the months ahead 
the consumer is coming off the sidelines as mortgage rates 
fall commented thomas holloway senior economist for the mortgage 
bankers association of america 
the commerce department said housing starts were up 08 percent 
last month following an 85 percent hike in june new homes and 
apartments were started in july at a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 143 million up from 142 million in june 
starts had fallen for four consecutive months through may as the 
federal reserve drove up interest rates to slow the economy and curb 
inflation that was the longest string of declines since housing 
activity slowed for five months in februaryjune 1987 
but as economic growth moderated the fed began nudging rates 
downward fixedrate 30year mortgages fell from 1122 percent in 
march to 996 percent last friday according to a survey by the 
federal home loan mortgage corp 
despite the overall rebound analysts saw problems in the 
multifamily component of the housing starts report 
while the singlefamily sector posted a 63 percent increase to 
104 million units annually in july apartment starts were off 12 
percent to 389000 units 
part of the decline in apartment starts was attributed to a heady 
329 percent increase in june which chief economist david berson of 
the federal national mortgage association said was unsustainable 
in view of the high vacancy rates 
michael carliner an economist at the national association of 
home builders said high rents and the elimination of tax incentives 
by the 1986 tax reform added to the weak multifamily pace 
and housing economist michael sumichrast said the 154 percent 
drop in apartment buildingpermit applications tells me that 
starts are going to decline sharply in the fall building permits 
are seen as a barometer of future multifamily housing activity 
singlefamily starts had risen 02 percent in june after falling 
51 percent in may and 47 percent in april apartment starts had 
increased 54 percent in may after falling 266 percent in april 
the northeast paced overall housing construction with a 16 
percent jump last month as starts rose to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 196000 units 
starts were up 11 percent to 272000 units in the midwest but 
fell 43 percent to 530000 units in the south and fell 42 percent 
to 432000 units in the west 
applications for building permits for both singlefamily houses 
and apartments were down 31 percent in july following a drop of 
29 percent in june they had risen 1 percent in may and 85 percent 
in april after three consecutive monthly declines

a shipping company and a tanker captain 
pleaded guilty today to federal charges of causing a 300000gallon 
oil spill off rhode island on june 23 and agreed to pay fines 
totaling 510000 
ballard shipping co a liberianregistered company operating in 
piraeus greece agreed to pay 500000 to the state for 
environmental research the captain iakovos georgudis a 
43yearold greek citizen agreed to a 10000 fine 
each pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor violation of the federal 
clean water act 
nearly 300000 gallons of heating oil spilled into the mouth of 
narragansett bay off newport when the tanker world prodigy ran 
aground 
if convicted the captain could have received a year in jail and 
a penalty equal to twice the amount of damage the coast guard has 
estimated the cleanup cost alone at 2 million the shipping company 
was also liable for twice the damage 
the captain also is under indictment on state charges carrying up 
to a year and a month in jail and fines of 20000 
us attorney lincoln almond said he did not press for harsher 
penalties because the spill resulted from simple negligence 
the captain became distracted and was also doing computations 
to double check estimates involving the unloading of the oil 
almond said 
we believe it was about a six or sevenminute lapse and there 
was nothing in advance of that that was not done properly 
he was simply trying to handle more than one person could 
handle at one time said peter dibiase georgudis attorney 
georgudis who had no comment after todays federal court 
hearing previously told the governor and coast guard officials that 
he failed to turn the vessel in time to avoid the reef 
he also admitted no harbor pilot was on board to take the tanker 
into port officials are investigating whether the vessel had passed 
the point at which one was required 
almond said he felt it was more appropriate to give the money to 
the state rather than to the federal government because state 
beaches and wildlife sustained the most damage

she got caught in a blizzard in the sierra nevada 
mountains while searching for a rugged outdoorswoman for mjb coffee 
commercials 
she toured the new york sewer system sang offkey for strangers 
in portland ore and prowled the docks before dawn at newport 
ri all in pursuit of average folks for television commercials 
kathy s sorkin 41 is founder and president of faces and places 
inc a new yorkbased casting agency that finds real people for 
advertising 
that task often requires the resourcefulness of a detective the 
perseverance of an athlete and a talent for setting strangers at 
ease twenty people on average are interviewed for every one that 
winds up in an ad 
its a lot of work doing that said daisy sinclair head of 
casting for the advertising agency ogilvy amp mather there is a 
special talent to stopping people cold and getting them to talk 
ms sorkin said the key is in being a good listener 
you have to listen for that clue to what they are hiding she 
said a man comes in saying i dont know what you are interested 
in me for to get that person talking and animated is a real 
challenge to me 
ms sorkin said using such characters adds credibility to the 
sales pitch because there is a genuine quality to real people that 
actors cant give you 
she wouldnt discuss what she charges clients for the farflung 
talent hunts but said the work keeps her on the road most of the 
year 
even when shes back in new york ms sorkin said shes never 
really off the job take her assignment from the new york state 
lottery for instance 
lottery officials trying to refute criticism that the game preys 
on poor people wanted advertising that demonstrated it appeals to 
rich people too 
ms sorkin staked out wall street and highbrow stores like 
bloomingdales and came up with dozens of people who got to dream 
aloud about what they would do with the money if they were to win 
the lottery 
but walking home one night she found a uniformed doorman who 
wound up in one ad saying that since his father liked to fish hed 
buy him a lake 
asked to find an authority on the perennial alligators in the 
sewers rumors for an ad about a new york radio station ms sorkin 
interviewed sewer workers and said they insisted on showing her 
their slimy abode no alligators showed up 
but most of her work takes her outside new york 
she went to portland ore for instance in search of people who 
would sing a jingle for kit kat candy bars she crooned for some 
candidates to set them at ease and see if they could hold a tune 
her search for the mjb coffee woman took her through a blizzard 
in the mountain passes in northern california before she found the 
right one near grass valley calif 
for a swansons fried chicken dinner commercial ms sorkin and 
her assistants fanned out from san francisco to sacramento 
searching the parks supermarkets financial districts restaurants 
and movie waiting lines 
she spent days on the docks before dawn in newport ri seeking 
fishermen heading to sea who used alka seltzer plus for tough colds 
the swanson and alka seltzer ads featured people saying why they 
use a specific brand the socalled testimonial approach requires 
special precautions 
to protect the credibility of the people chosen for such ads ms 
sorkin makes sure candidates never suspect they are under 
consideration for starring in a commercial 
she and her assistants describing themselves as market 
researchers often stop people by asking if they would like to 
participate in a consumer survey 
the questions are designed to determine if interviewees use a 
specific brand that will be advertised without letting them know 
what the product is or that the admakers are seeking people for a 
commercial 
those who qualify are invited to another questionandanswer 
session which is videotaped the tape serves as the legal record 
that they volunteered they use a specific brand 
television networks which try to guard against deceptive 
advertising often demand proof that interviewees werent coached 
as an added safeguard against deception ms sorkin said many 
people arent told until after the ad has been shot that they were 
filmed for a commercial and will be paid for it those who dont 
want to participate are dropped 
pay varies depending on the role ms sorkin said people in a 
principal role usually get a onetime fee and extra payments based 
on how often and how widely the ad runs 
faces and places goes to extraordinary lengths to find credible 
people but it isnt the only agency specializing in seeking 
nonprofessionals for commercial roles 
laura slutsky for instance has run the new yorkbased 
peoplefinders agency for 15 years among her recent finds have been 
several families for surf detergent commercials and autoworkers who 
describe the pride they feel in their jobs in a ford motor co ad 
campaign 
she also worked on alka seltzer plus commercials persuading 30 
montana ranchers to travel up to 100 miles in the dead of winter to 
discuss their colds with her on videotape at a helena hotel eight 
of them made the commercial 
but sometimes hard work doesnt pay off 
ms sorkin said she interviewed 300 people a day for a week in 
bristol tenn for a slice soft drink commercial but couldnt find 
people who pronounced the drinks name without a southern lilt she 
said the admaker eventually flew in outsiders to appear in the ads 
its an exhausting process said michael leonard senior vice 
president at hal riney amp partners a san franciscobased ad agency 
that worked with ms sorkin on the mjb coffee and swansons dinner 
ads 
ms sorkin said she figures her work is helping people partly 
fulfill artist andy warhols prophecy that everyone will be famous 
for 15 minutes she helps them get there for about 30 seconds

the sultry summer is especially sweaty this year for texaco 
station operator sam rodar and its not from the heat because his 
supplier is his chief competitor rodar says he walks a pricing 
tightrope 
wholesale gasoline prices have been falling but rodar says he 
cant pass along the savings to customers because his supplier could 
get mad and drive him out of business 
his predicament illustrates what gasoline market experts call a 
nationwide problem that is hurting retail gasoline sellers and 
motorists alike while wholesale prices have dropped as much as 28 
cents since midmay because of an oversupply and sluggish demand 
retail prices have fallen only about 6 cents 
its a wholesalers market right now says tom kloza editor 
of oil price information service an industry newsletter 
distributors are wallowing like pigs in slop 
service station dealers blame oil companies and suppliers for 
keeping gasoline prices high when they should be lower suppliers 
claim tighter government regulations and higher insurance rates have 
raised costs oil companies are reluctant to talk about prices but 
say theyre set by the market 
nonetheless the market laws of supply and demand dont 
necessarily hold in what dealers call the dogeatdog world of 
peddling gasoline 
the problem here is that some of the dogs are much bigger than 
others and some cant bite back says rodar who operates a 
station outside sante fe nm 
in rural areas like that the distributor or middleman between 
the refiner and dealer often controls prices in big cities 
dealers often buy directly from the refiner 
in both situations dealers claim they dont get the benefit of 
cheaper prices because they have little influence over the supply 
controlled by oil companies their refiners and distribution 
networks 
in some cases they do have a lock on the market concedes 
david morehead spokesman for the petroleum marketers association 
which represents 10000 wholesalers and retailers nationwide 
but morehead says this years erratic price shifts are unusual 
and dont reflect the broader forces shaping the price of gasoline 
a lot of what they have in inventory they bought at higher 
prices and they want to go through that inventory first before they 
pass on the prices he says ultimately competition will 
return 
gasoline prices soared after the march 24 exxon valdez oil spill 
in alaska due partly to concerns that there wouldnt be enough fuel 
to meet the predicted strong summer demand refiners rushed to 
produce more gasoline and by may wholesale prices were falling 
rapidly but motorists didnt see much change 
glenn nilsson director of the lone star service station 
association in houston says his dealers face a problem similar to 
rodars but in their case the bad guys are the big oil refineries 
the majors have created an artificial profit by keeping prices 
high to the dealer nilsson says they got prices up there and 
they left them up there 
most major oil companies decline to comment on pricing practices 
exxon corp spokesman les rogers said we monitor our markets 
daily closely and we set our prices to be competitive so its 
purely and simply a response to market conditions 
rodar says his biggest complaint is that his supplier can control 
prices and make big profits at the same time 
the supplier for example buys unleaded gasoline for 935 cents 
a gallon from the refiner sells it to rodar for 105 and charges 
121 at his own pump the same as rodar that means the supplier 
makes 275 cents a gallon in profit vs 16 cents for rodar 
i hate to lead the market in any direction because he has the 
ability to price discipline me says rodar he could sell it for 
what i pay for it and literally drive me out of the market 
rodars supplier chester berridge president of berridge 
distributing co inc of santa fe says he is not in business as a 
charitable organization 
berridge defends his prices by saying the costs of business have 
rocketed because of new pollution regulations requiring station 
owners to upgrade equipment and increase insurance coverage 
berridge who supplies 17 new mexico dealers including himself 
says his insurance premiums have soared to 204000 a year from 
12000 and his cost of installing new equipment is about 135000 
per station 
if you think we can stay in this business and make a profit 
then you dont know this business berridge says 
prices elsewhere show the evident disadvantage dealers face in 
competing with oil company refiners and suppliers that also sell 
directly to the public 
in houston for example the gap between what refiners charge 
suppliers and what they charge dealers was 1635 cents as of early 
this month the biggest gap this year nilsson says the normal gap 
is 1 to 4 cents 
in san francisco the average cost to wholesalers was 596 cents 
a gallon vs 776 cents to dealers in late july and in atlanta it 
was 56 cents to wholesalers vs 695 cents to dealers oil price 
information service figures show 
rodar claims he cant go elsewhere to get gasoline because other 
texaco distributors wont sell to him 
we have people who want to go to these suppliers and buy for 
less but the refiner in most cases has put pressure on the 
wholesaler to not sell to socalled captive customers says 
nilsson 
a few states including maryland and connecticut have attempted 
to deal with the problem by banning oil companies from selling 
gasoline at the retail level says wayne konitshek a denverbased 
dealer lobbyist 
konitshek says he believes pricing practices by refiners and 
distributors have helped drive dealers out of business the number 
of dealers has fallen from 330000 in 1972 to 108000 today he says 
houston dealers several years ago sued major oil companies under 
antitrust laws nilsson says 
prices dropped dramatically practically overnight and the 
dealers dropped the suit he says 
a lawsuit filed in state district court in houston last april 
against exxon by 19 exxon dealers accuses the oil company of 15 
violations of texas antitrust and deceptive trade practice laws 
the counts include profiteering from dealers saddling consumers 
with high fuel costs and interfering with their ability to buy 
cheaper gasoline elsewhere 
the suit which seeks more than 5 million in damages is pending 
five similar suits are pending in other states konitshek says

pillsbury co moved to drop another subsidiary 
as it announced plans wednesday to sell bumble bee seafoods inc to 
an affiliate of unicord co ltd of thailand for 269 million in 
cash 
the deal is unusual in that the buyer is from thailand a poor 
southeast asian nation that is trying to catch up with the surging 
four tigers of south korea taiwan singapore and hong kong 
the acquisition of bumble bee marks the first time that a thai 
company has purchased an american concern of this magnitude said 
dumri konuntakiet unicords chief executive officer and controlling

our companys foodrelated activities on a global scale 
pillsbury bought bumble bee then privately held for 242 
million in july 1988 but officials said wednesday that holding on 
to bumble bee doesnt fit with the longterm strategies of 
pillsbury which has been streamlining since its 57 billion 
acquisition by grand metropolitan plc of great britain in january 
just last week pillsbury announced that it will sell its van de 
kamps frozen seafoods division to chicagobased whitman corp for 
about 140 million in cash 
bumble bee like van de kamps is an exceptionally strong 
company however it does not fit with pillsburys longrange 
strategy for its core businesses ian a martin chairman and 
chief executive officer of pillsbury said in a statement 
the sale of bumble bee and its santa fe springs calif 
manufacturing facility to the newly formed uni group inc a 
usbased affiliate of unicord is expected to be completed in 
september the companies said 
unicord is a leading thai seafood processing and exporting 
company 
the san diego califbased bumble bee markets products including

a former san francisco savings and loan 
branch manager has been charged with embezzling 347 million from 
customers deposits over more than four years authorities said 
wednesday 
richard a mariucci 30 was arrested by the fbi tuesday at his 
home in the riverside county community of rancho said us attorney 
joseph russoniello he released a 29count indictment against 
mariucci that was returned friday by a federal grand jury 
mariucci managed a san francisco branch of gibraltar savings and 
loan from 1985 to april 1989 when he was fired for reasons 
unrelated to the embezzlement investigation the fbi said 
he could be sentenced to 145 years in prison and fined 725 
million if convicted of all charges russoniello said 
the problem came to light two days after mariucci was fired when 
a customer asked about the 100000 certificate of deposit she had 
taken out with gibraltar the previous september and was told there 
was no record of her account said fbi agent kathryn reeve in a 
sworn statement 
she said an investigation showed that mariucci took certificate 
of deposit checks that were placed with him and put much of the 
money in a personal account while setting aside the rest to repay 
earlier depositors and avoid discovery 
reeves statement listed eight customers who were verified as 
having deposited money that was not in their accounts and another 
six who had been identified by gibraltar and said the list may 
grow the indictment states 29 instances of embezzlement of amounts 
ranging up to 400000 between february 1985 and april 1989 
agents seized over 639000 from accounts controlled by mariucci 
at seven institutions on may 9 reeve said 
court documents did not mention the recovery of any of the other 
allegedly embezzled funds assistant us attorney mark zanides said 
mariucci may have put some of the money into real estate

the list of potential buyers for six theme 
parks owned by harcourt brace jovanovich inc has been narrowed to 
six and analysts expect a selection may come within a month 
according to a published report wednesday 
anheuserbusch cos inc the st louisbased beermaker and 
owner of busch gardens theme parks including one in tampa is the 
frontrunner and most likely buyer a source close to the 
negotiations told the orlando sentinel others on the list 
reportedly include walt disney co based in burbank calif 
potential buyers are being escorted this week and next through 
the theme parks and have received a detailed package of financial 
information the sentinel reported 
i think they are getting much closer to making a transaction on 
the parks said joe frazzano an analyst who follows hbj for 
oppenheimer amp co a new york brokerage told the newspaper i 
think they will certainly have an announcement within a month or 
so 
a call for comment on the report was placed to hbj but it was not 
returned 
but robert evanson hbjs executive vice president for parks has 
previously said the sale would be announced by sept 30 the end of 
hbjs third fiscal quarter 
spokesmen for anheueserbusch and disney each said they do not 
comment on speculation about acquisitions 
orlandobased hbj announced in june the parks would be sold to 
pay down some of the debt incurred two years ago defending itself 
against a hostile takeover attempt by british publisher robert 
maxwell industry analysts estimate the parks will garner at least 
13 billion 
the sea world parks being sold are in orlando san diego san 
antonio texas and aurora ohio also on the block are venerable 
cypress gardens in winter haven and boardwalk and baseball near 
haines city 
nearly 25 prospective buyers were sent an initial packet of 
financial information and projections about six weeks ago another 
packet was distributed in the past two weeks to prospective buyers 
with adequate financial backing and that hbj considers serious 
three former sea world executives george millay jan schultz 
and robert hillebrecht last month said they would make a bid for 
the parks 
florida leisure acquisition corp which owns the silver springs 
and weeki wachee attractions in florida said last week its also 
interested the former sea world group and florida leisure would not

the farm credit system on wednesday reported its 
secondquarter net income was down 65 percent from the same period 
last year and warned that 
the system the nations biggest lender to agriculture said it 
earned 159 million for the quarter ended june 30 compared with 170 
million in the 1988 period 
for the first six months of the year the system showed profits 
of 317 million down 57 percent from 336 million in the first 
half of 1988 
although overall net income declined during the quarter net 
interest income rose by 42 million to 256 million the improvement 
stemmed from continued improvement in the systems loan credit 
quality and its interest margin the difference between its 
borrowing costs and interest on loans it makes said alan d fass 
president and chief executive officer of the federal farm credit 
banks funding corp the credit systems financing arm 
the systems secondquarter results indicate a continued 
strengthening of the systems overall financial condition said 
fass 
for the first half net interest income was 496 million up from 
360 million in 1988 
fass also said the system was aided by repurchases by some system 
banks of portions of their highercost debt and retirement of some 
other highercost debt that matured in the last year 
but the system said in a statement that certain system banks 
remain in a weakened financial condition and that drought 
conditions persist in scattered regions it said it believes 
adequate allowances for loan losses are being maintained to cover 
credit risks from possible droughtrelated losses 
fass said department of agriculture projections for the systems 
net cash income for 1989 remain just slightly under last years 
levels 
this should mean stronger financial positions for system 
borrowers resulting in continued improvement in the credit quality 
of the systems loan portfolio he said 
nonaccrual loans declined to 287 billion as of june 30 from 
33 billion on dec 31 1988 loans considered highrisk 
excluding nonaccruing loans rose to 458 billion as of june 30 
from 456 billion six months earlier mainly due to a 194 million 
increase in the amount of restructured loans 
the allowance for loan losses was 172 billion as of june 30 up 
from 186 billion at yearend 1988 during the second quarter the 
system took an 80 million negative provision for loan losses 
compared with 181 million in the 1988 quarter 
the farm credit system is a nationwide system of federally 
chartered agricultural lending institutions serving the rural 
economy and cooperatively owned by their borrowers 
the system took several steps last year to streamline its 
structure following 1987 bailout legislation that included the 
issuance of up to 4 billion in governmentbacked lowinterest 
loans

a lot of people were squaring their positions ahead of 
thursdays trade report said gary lutnick a trader for banco di 
sicilia in new york 
the commerce department is scheduled to release figures on the 
merchandise trade deficit for june and some traders are predicting 
a shortfall of around 95 billion they said the dollar is likely 
to rally if the gap falls below 9 billion but decline should it 
exceed 10 billion 
a low trade deficit is seen as positive for the dollar because it 
means the currency probably wont have to decline any further to 
help improve the us trade picture a weak dollar makes us 
exports more attractive 
meanwhile lutnick said the currency market largely ignored the 
economic figures released wednesday showing industrial production 
rising for the first time in three months during july and housing 
starts continuing to rebound that month

the walt disney co and henson associates 
inc declined comment wednesday on reports that disney is 
negotiating to buy the group of companies controlled by jim henson 
who created the muppet show 
the proposed deal for henson associates inc calls for henson to 
operate a production company in los angeles under the disney 
umbrella the hollywood reporter said 
the entertainment trade daily quoted an unidentified source 
monday as saying the value of the deal could exceed 100 million 
the wall street journal carried a similar story wednesday but said 
it had been unable to determine a price 
disney spokesman erwin okun and henson spokeswoman susan berry 
declined to comment but analysts said the henson characters miss 
piggy kermit the frog and the other muppets stars of several 
movies as well as tv would fit in perfectly with disneys mickey 
mouse and his cohorts 
the muppets are probably second only to disneys characters in 
worldwide recognition said jeff logsdon of the crowell weedon amp co 
brokerage in los angeles 
obviously its a franchise that extends disneys already deep 
penetration into the childrens market if it turns out to be 
true logsdon said 
it makes a lot of sense in terms of both companies said 
harold vogel an analyst for merrill lynch in new york 
disney could use the extra characters and could merchandise 
them more effectively than anyone else and henson has a lot of 
overhead vogel said disneys distribution network would be 
especially helpful for them 
henson associates based in new york includes henson 
international television which controls rights to the muppet 
show a videocassette label and merchandising licensing and 
publishing divisions 
besides the muppet show the company has produced and 
distributed such programs as fraggle rock the storyteller 
and muppet babies all successful internationally 
henson has distributed such shows as the adventures of teddy 
ruxpin on behalf of others and last year the jim henson hour 
was broadcast briefly on nbctv but was pulled before the end of 
its run 
the muppets would join quite a menagerie of characters disney has 
introduced over the past two years roger rabbit and the fall 
release the little mermaid in animated movies the toprated 
duck tales and coming out this fall chip amp dale rescue 
rangers on afternoon tv 
theres all kinds of combinations you could extend logsdon 
mused the little mermaid dates kermit the frog they get 
saved by chip and dales rescue rangers

wang laboratories inc said wednesday it 
will suspend payments on 2086 million in institutional debts an 
apparent step to give it a stronger hand in negotiations with its 
bank lenders 
the cashshort computer giant has been trying to negotiate a new 
line of credit with a group of eight banks led by bank of boston 
to replace a 300 million credit line that expires sept 30 
by suspending payments on the 2086 million in commercial paper 
and bank notes it is putting more pressure on the eight bank 
lenders since those banks also hold some of the securities in 
question 
i think its fairly straightforward that theyre calling the 
bluff of their banks playing hardball said john w adams 
chairman of adams harkness amp hill in boston 
wang reported a 4243 million loss for the fiscal year that 
ended june 30 and had speeded up plans to lay off more than 2200 
workers by sept 30 
an wang the founder chief executive and chairman has recently 
undergone treatment for cancer last week in an unexpected move 
his son and heir apparent frederick wang stepped down as president 
and chief operating officer 
wang has 962 million in short and longterm debt altogether and 
is trying to restructure all of it 
wang stock fell 50 cents a share to 6 a share on the american 
stock exchange 
company chairman an wang said in a terse statement that the 
company would suspend principal and interest payments on certain 
institutional debts 
paul henning director of investor relations said later the 
freeze would apply to 125 million of commercial paper as well as 
836 million in notes payable to banks 
henning said the negotiations had been long and difficult and 
arduous and complex 
when youre dealing with a consortium of eight banks 
getting nine parties to come to an agreement gets complex he said 
henning stressed that the move applied only to institutional 
debts and said the company intended to remain current on all other 
obligations including trade credits operating costs vendor bills 
customer service and overseas operations while negotiations 
continue 
adams said despite those woes wangs balance sheet at yearend 
was a fairly strong one 
that particularly as modern balance sheets go is a pretty 
bankable situation he said it doesnt reflect tremendously 
well on the banking group if with that balance sheet they cant 
put together a lending agreement and a loan 
adams added they sure have cast down the gauntlet 
another analyst said wangs action was unusual but not 
unprecedented 
theyre saying well we dont like the new terms and we dont 
have the funds to pay you under the old terms said fred pastore 
vice president with moodys investors service in new york but he 
added certainly if a company cant pay its bills and meet the 
terms of its original obligation to the banks that doesnt look 
good

grain and soybean futures closed mixed wednesday 
on the chicago board of trade as traders reacted to forecasts of 
more rain in major cropproducing areas 
soybean futures were off sharply because of the uncertain weather 
outlook analysts said

some airline safety experts say theyre surprised 
at figures showing that widebody jets have experienced at least 288 
instances of engine trouble in the past six years including 16 
serious incidents that could have led to a crash 
the figures were obtained from federal aviation administration 
records and reported in an article in wednesdays editions of the 
st paul pioneer press dispatch 
its certainly of concern said richard livingston of the 
110000member international airline passengers association 
obviously any time you have an uncontained engine explosion 
youve opened the door to catastrophe 
john nance a pilot and air safety analyst who generally defends 
the safety of airlines said it is higher than i would have 
expected 
the 16 serious incidents occurred when engine parts tore into the 
engine casing or hurtled out of the engine according to the faa 
records 
it is believed that debris thrown from a failed engine severed 
hydraulic lines on the united airlines dc10 that crashed in sioux 
city iowa on july 19 the crash which killed more than 100 
people remains under investigation 
the faa numbers are based on the agencys service difficulty 
reports since 1983 for the general electric cf6 and pratt amp whitney 
jt9 engines the ones used on the most us widebody jets the 
figures exclude smaller aircraft that are far more numerous in 
airline fleets 
the number of incidents detailed in the faa records is surprising 
to some the newspaper said because after the sioux city crash the 
national transportation safety board said there have been only 12 
other uncontained engine failures on any type of commercial 
jetliner since 1982 
but that counts only incidents in which there was injury death 
or what the agency regards as an immediate threat to safety 
engine makers and airlines as well as the faa and the national 
transportation safety board stress that serious engine breakups are 
still rare blades and other parts breaking away from engines are a 
fact of life since the blades often spin at over 10000 revolutions 
per minute and are weakened by birds stress and ice 
but such incidents rarely result in accidents because the parts 
usually are contained in the engine casing or spit out in the 
engines exhaust 
engine designs use the best available technology said bob hall 
an engineer for the air line pilots association but just like 
anything else in this world there are times when all that doesnt 
come to fruition 
said nance the problem is not that the engines are going to 
come apart the problem is trying to contain them when they do 
of the 288 instances of engine trouble on widebody jets at 
least 94 occurred when blades broke from compressors and turbines 
and seriously damaged engines but didnt spew parts out of the 
engine casing 
in 58 more cases records arent conclusive on whether the blades 
simply cracked or broke off but they indicate the engines often 
were seriously damaged 
the faa records often arent clear about the severity of the 
damage in the 16 cases of engine case penetration reports in 
four of the incidents note the case was violated but dont detail 
the damage two say parts protruded from or were embedded in the 
casing

some countries are lowering barriers to foreign 
ownership of their oil and other resources but many governments 
hold on to restrictions that give their own citizens an advantage 
the us international trade commission reported wednesday 
to the extent that a local industry has raw material or other 
production cost advantages due to a government program the products 
of the industry obtain an advantage in world markets it said 
it found that venezuela has a 94 percent price advantage for 
natural gas and 91 percent for fuel oil saudi arabia 83 percent for 
gas and 72 percent for fuel oil indonesia a 50 percent advantage 
for gas and none for fuel oil 
in mexico production costs are as much as 1925 percent lower 
than in the united states due to savings from lower priced resources 
the report added that us imports increased because of these 
price advantages 
the report made at the request of congress concentrated on 
investment in the oil industry 
it found wide variation in the effects of other governments 
policies on foreigners 
indonesia for example has recently permitted companies to be 
treated like those locally owned as long as 51 percent of the stock 
is held by indonesian nationals but foreigners are still limited to 
a minority interest until recently only companies completely owned 
by indonesian citizens were allowed to distribute goods 
though the soviet union is now permitting foreigners to hold a 
majority of the stock in some joint ventures they are limited to a 
minority holding in energy and the major industries that consume it 
the communist government of china started encouraging foreign 
investors much earlier than the soviets but still subjects them to a 
long bureaucratic approval process the report said 
a new law in mexico this year automatically approves companies 
owned by foreigners if the investment is less than 100 million but 
the foreign share in a telecommunications firm is stil limited to 49 
percent and needs the approval of the national foreign investment 
commission 
the mexican government continues to hold exclusive rights to 
explore and develop oil and natural gas and to produce basic 
petrochemicals radioactive material and energy 
canada insists on 50 percent ownership by its nationals before 
issuing licenses to exploit natural resources in frontier areas 
saudi arabia keeps exclusive control of minerals except for oil 
and natural gas 
venezuela controls the domestic oil industry through the 
stateowned petroleos de venezuela 
most members of the organization of petroleum expoprting 
countries opec control their domestic energy industries

stock brokers who deal in lowpriced often 
risky securities known as penny stocks must obtain a new 
customers written approval before completing a sale under a rule 
adopted wednesday by the securities and exchange commission 
the new rule comes in response to a dramatic rise in the 
fraudulent sale of penny stocks which are usually not traded on 
exchanges or quoted on the national association of securities 
dealers automated quotation nasdaq system commonly known as the 
national overthecounter market 
the new rule will take effect jan 1 1990 
in other matters the sec voted to seek comment on revised rule 
proposals for disclosure of securities trades by corporate officers 
and other insiders a proposal to raise the minimum net capital 
required of registered broker dealers to as much as 250000 
depending on the ther method of computing net capital 
the sec also was supposed to consider new rules on information to 
be disclosed during takeover battles but those proposals have been 
shelved until early september to give the sec more time to consider 
the issue 
because most penny stocks usually selling for a few cents to a 
few dollars per share are not listed nationally information about 
them is hard to come by and fraudulent claims are difficult to 
dispute 
before the commission voted unanimously 5to0 to approve the 
rule sec chairman david s ruder said the problem was of great 
concern to the agency but he and several other members of the 
commission also noted most penny stocks and penny stock dealers are 
legitimate 
commissioner charles c cox said he was distressed that because 
of bad publicity penny stock is almost becoming synonymous with 
fraud and manipulative practices 
two weeks ago 14 people and two companies were charged in 
chicago with an alleged 10 million penny stock scam in which the 
companies share prices were artificially raised and the shares then 
sold at large profits 
last fall ruder created a penny stock task force that found a 
key element of penny stock fraud was highpressure sales tactics 
often over the telephone on small unsophisticated investors 
industry officials say the problem lies with unscrupulous 
salesmen who pressure investors to buy the highrisk stocks of new 
or small companies or with crooks peddling the stocks of sham 
companies 
the rapidly rising tide of penny stock fraud and abuse is 
the no 1 threat facing small investors according to the north 
american securities administrators association a statelevel 
investment regulators group 
in the first half of the current fiscal year the sec has 
received 2462 complaints about penny stock fraud compared to 1510 
for all of last year 
this will help us in our investigations james i goldstein 
head of the task force said of the new rule heres something 
that will require writings to be made said goldstein who is also 
an associate director of enforcement with the sec 
the new rule first proposed in february will require brokers 
and dealers to obtain written purchase agreements from new customers 
before completing their first three transactions in stocks that are 
neither traded on stock exchanges nor through the nasdaq system 
the rule would apply to stocks selling at 499 or less per share 
or to stocks issued by companies with less than 2 million in 
tangible assets 
brokerdealers also would have to obtain financial information 
from the customer such as income investment experience and 
investment objectives determine whether the transaction is suitable 
for the customers needs and write down the basis for that 
determination 
securities issued by some companies and sales to certain 
investors would be exempt from the put it in writing requirements 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
those exceptions include initial public offerings that are 
scheduled to be listed with nasdaq or a stock exchange and customers 
who have dealt with the broker previously

the chicago board of trade has refused to take 
action against the chairman of a major grain company in response to 
member complaints that his comments about the cbot have damaged the 
exchange officials said wednesday 
cbot chairman karsten mahlmann said in a notice to members that 
to punish dwayne andreas for his comments about the exchange would 
be inappropriate because andreas is not a board of trade member 
last month andreas chairman of decatur illbased 
archerdanielsmidland co criticized the board of trade after the 
exchange ordered traders to reduce their holdings in the july 
soybean futures contract to 1 million bushels 
the july 11 order was apparently made to break up an alleged 
attempt by the italian grain merchant ferruzzi finanziaria spa to 
corner the us soybean market ferruzzi has denied making such an 
attempt 
after the order was issued andreas said the cbot has exposed 
itself to cornering attempts because it has fallen behind the times 
he said the cbot had become more of a gambling institution than a 
hedging center 
a petition circulated by members of the cbot contended that 
andreas comments constitute actions detrimental to the welfare of 
the cbot the petition signed by more than 100 members asked the 
exchanges board of directors to suspend the clearing privileges of 
adm investor services inc archerdanielsmidlands cbot clearing 
affiliate 
in a letter dated aug 14 mahlmann reminded andreas that as 
chairman of a member firm andreas is obligated to present 
information to the exchange on any member in violation of the 
exchanges rules 
accordingly the chicago board of trade remains open to 
receiving any information which your firm wishes to provide in 
evidence of possible rule violations under the exchanges purview 
mahlmann wrote 
a woman who said she was andreas secretary said wednesday he was 
unavailable for comment on the letter

americanowned assembly plants refuse to 
sign with a corrupt union leader in order to end a 23dayold 
labor dispute because giving in would be like spreading a cancer 
throughout the industry a spokesman said wednesday 
nobody is understanding the real issue here the obvious and 
blatant corruption in mexico said arnold kezsbom president of 
the new yorkbased service manufacturing corp which manufactures 
soft luggage 
the corporations assembly plant in this northern border city is 
one of 15 companies involved in a union power struggle with a local 
leader of the mexican labor federation or ctm 
the ctms rafael morales put up strike flags and closed the gates 
of the plants july 25 after abel hernandez the union leader 
representing the workers withdrew from the ctm 
the strike is costing the plants about 500000 a day in lost 
production and at least two have threatened to pull out of mexico 
morales argued that because the plants had no ctm union leader 
he had the right to declare himself in charge said managers who 
have spoken to him 
the ctm is the most powerful labor union in tamaulipas state and 
few dare to challenge its authority 
so it was a rare show of force when about 900 out of some 2000 
plant workers affected by the strike ripped down ctm strike flags 
tuesday locked themselves in their plants and returned to work 
the workers have vowed to remain inside the plants until the 
dispute is solved 
the important thing is that were at our jobs we dont want 
these plants to close said gustin villanueva a worker at 
invamex a subsidiary of the elyria ohiobased invacare corp 
wheelchair manufacturer 
the strike flags were replaced early wednesday by the local labor 
arbitration board and reynosa mayor ernesto gomez lira 
groups of about a dozen of morales men stood outside the plants 
with orders not to let anybody in or out said juan olivo a 
laborer at a plant unionized under morales 
the labor board controlled by the ctm has authorized morales as 
union leader but the plants are arguing against that decision in 
federal court and with top federal authorities 
kezsbom said in an interview in mcallen texas just north of 
reynosa that the companies have decided to stand firm against 
morales because he is known as a corrupt individual 
he said that giving in would be like spreading a cancer 
throughout the industry 
kezsbom said morales forces companies to allow his union to 
control trucking contracts transportation of waste and even food 
coupons so that workers have to buy food from stores he controls 
there is no way to control business costs when dealing with a 
union head whose demands escalate each day he said 
reporters have been unable to locate morales for several days at 
his headquarters his home or the places he is known to frequent 
kezbom meanwhile denounced gomez liras gangstertype 
tactics in dealing with workers in the middle of the night 
gomez lira toured most of the plants about 1 am and told 
workers locked inside that they should leave peacefully or the 
police would take them out workers interviewed said 
gomez lira told the associated press that he recommended the 
workers leave to prevent confrontations that might occurr 
but don king manager of the west bend wisbased west bend 
plant said gomez lira harassed employees and intimidated them try 
to get them to leave 
the workers say they have no obligation under mexican labor law 
to sign with the ctm and in fact are happy with hernandez no 
matter whom he represents

investor marvin davis on wednesday increased his 
bid for ual corp to 62 billion and set the stage for a proxy 
battle for the parent of united airlines 
a spokesman for davis said the price could go higher after a 
review of the companys internal data 
davis offered 240 a share or 54 billion earlier this month 
revitalizing interest in buying chicagobased ual his latest offer 
is 275 a share 
the stock closed wednesday at 25175 on the new york stock 
exchange down 250 davis new bid was revealed after the market 
closed 
last weekend ual officials reportedly met with leaders of the 
air line pilots association to discuss a possible 
managementemployee buyout or recapitalization to put a large chunk 
of shares into an employee stock ownership plan as a means of 
blocking any hostile takeover 
davis emphasized that he does not want to be regarded as an 
unfriendly suitor 
our continuing desire is to proceed on a friendly basis 
said spokesman james n fingeroth 
meanwhile wednesday ual said it had been served with a 
stockholder consent form from davis asking shareholders to remove 
all members of the companys board of directors except chairman 
stephen m wolf reduce the boards membership to five from 16 and 
elect a new slate headed by davis 
the davis spokesman said the document is intended only to 
establish a time frame aug 16 to oct 15 for determining which 
shareholders would be eligible to vote on the measures should there 
be a proxy battle 
this is not to be interpreted as a change in mr davis 
policy said fingeroth adding that davis does not now intend to 
exercise the option to solicit votes against the current board 
ual had no response to davis action said spokeswoman sara 
dornacker 
she said the ual board will meet thursday but would not say if 
it is a special meeting held in response to the latest davis moves

eastern airlines agreed wednesday to pay more than 
32 million into the pension fund of striking pilots to settle a 
2yearold suit against the financially troubled carrier 
a statement from the air line pilots association in washington 
dc predicted the payment will be approved in us bankruptcy 
court which has supervised easterns finances since the carrier 
filed for chapter 11 protection five days after the march 4 strike 
by pilots flight attendants and machinists 
the settlement sets a sept 15 deadline for the payment of the 
32 million which represents regular company payments into the fund 
and interest from 1985 to 1988 alpa said 
a 1987 alpa suit filed in us district court in washington 
claimed eastern violated federal law by failing to make scheduled 
pension payments if us bankruptcy judge burton lifland does not 
approve the settlement alpa said it would file another suit 
eastern which was reportedly losing 1 million a day before the 
strike was granted two waivers by the internal revenue service 
since 1985 to withhold some pension payments said robin matell a 
spokesman for the miamibased carrier 
since the strike eastern has attempted to rebound as a smaller 
airline the company has stated its goal of rebuilding to twothirds 
of its 1040 prestrike flight schedule 
matell said eastern a division of texas air corp owes a total 
of about 98 million in outstanding payments and interest to its 
seven employee pension funds he was unaware of any other employee 
legal action similar to the alpa suit 
part of the carriers plan to emerge from chapter 11 include 
ontime payment to its pension plans eastern announced in june it 
plans to pay about 100 million into various pension plans by sept 
15 
on june 1 eastern reached an agreement with the us labor 
department to pay 31 million to several benefit plans to settle a 
case in which the government alleged the carrier illegally tapped 
employee funds to pay corporate expenses 
eastern entered into the agreement without admitting or denying 
it violated federal pension laws

an aviation industry task force said wednesday it 
gave the federal aviation administration guidelines for a program to 
prevent and repair corrosion on boeing commercial airplanes 
the 10month study examined corrosion data from airline reports 
faa records and a boeing fleet survey on boeing 707 727 737 and 
747 jetliners

repair program for each section of the aircraft studied 
the task force included boeing structural specialists airline 
maintenance experts and observers from the faa and from foreign 
regulatory agencies it grew out of studies that government and 
industry groups made after a 1988 accident in which the roof of an 
aloha airlines boeing 737 peeled off over hawaii sweeping one 
flight attending to her death 
boeing spokesman jack gamble said the task forces 
recommendations were drawn up to be used as a basis for the first 
industrywide standards on corrosion 
the faa will study the recommendations and is expected to propose 
a mandatory anticorrosion program for us airlines the task force
