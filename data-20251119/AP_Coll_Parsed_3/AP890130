george esper spent 10 years covering the vietnam 
war for the associated press and has just completed his second 
reporting visit to the country since the war ended in 1975

former viet cong fighters carried 
legless comrades on their backs and led the blind to welcome 
american enemies who returned in peace long after the terrible war 
they were faceless to each other on the battlefield each a 
possible statistic on the others casualty report now they met at 
the tay ninh rehabilitation center and spoke of pain and sorrow 
the americans looked at the viet cong guerrillas they had feared 
and hated who had killed their buddies they saw men and women in 
or near middle age learning to live without lost arms legs hands 
or eyes 
i wanted to shake peoples hands and there werent hands to 
shake said kevin bowen of boston 
vietnam so deeply affected the conscience of america said 
william r kimball of south lake tahoe calif founder of vets with 
a mission which brings groups of veterans back to vietnam 
its a place that i dont think you could ever really leave 
behind he said it was inevitable that america come back and 
youre seeing the first trickle of a flood thats going to take 
place in the next few years 
four years ago it was rare to see an american in vietnam now 
increasing numbers of veterans relief workers physicians and 
surgeons return on goodwill missions 
they build health clinics perform plastic surgery on disfigured 
children deliver medical supplies and bibles walk old battlefields 
to call attention to unexploded shells and mines that remain deadly 
14 years after the war ended 
it took the vietnam veterans themselves to build the memorial 
in washington dc and recognize the terrible loss that 
occurred said ralph timperi now assistant public health 
commissioner of massachusetts 
its vietnam veterans who are taking the leadership to get our 
country to recognize the terrible loss the vietnamese have 
suffered he said 
bowen and timperi represented the joiner foundation of the 
university of massachusetts which aids hospitals and the disabled 
in vietnam they met with disabled veterans in hanoi and tay ninh 
province 
by returning and working with the people as friends rather than 
enemies we can do the kind of work we thought we were doing to 
begin with timperi said we thought we were doing something 
good when we were in the war it turned out we werent by returning 
and doing what in our idealistic framework we see as what americans 
ought to be doing it helps us find ourselves again 
a new group of americans arrives almost every week some just 
come for peace of mind to put their war to rest 
five former us marines revisited bases around which their 
battalion the 11th marines planted 100000 mines they did not 
remove the mines and unexploded shells that still kill and maim 
civilians but will report their findings to the vietnamese and us 
governments in hopes of action 
the marines also unfurled the stars and stripes and honored their 
dead in brief ceremonies at two former us bases 
nine bornagain christians delivered 5000 bibles to the 
protestant church of vietnam on behalf of kimballs vets with a 
mission and met some of their former enemies at a reconciliation 
dinner 
youre not really going to find a true healing and a true 
reconciliation until were able to face our former foe and to shake 
hands and to find a mutual understanding kimball said i think 
that is what is taking place 
vets with a mission hopes on future visit to build a 
rehabilitation ward and repair a therapy pool in an orphanage for 
polio victims and to build a christian day care center 
it seemed like every corner i turned i bumped into an 
american said bill johnson of manchester conn one of the 
marine engineers im really amazed at how many groups are here 
vietnam has opened its doors to americans more than at any time 
since the war it hopes the united states will extend diplomatic 
recognition bringing desperately needed aid and the end of an 
economically disastrous trade embargo 
vietnamese officials express optimism that ambassadors will be 
exchanged within two years they say us demands that hanoi 
withdraw all its troops from cambodia which vietnam has occupied 
for 10 years will be met by next year 
some veterans acknowledge vietnam uses their visits to further 
its goal of recognition but they feel much more is involved 
i think too many things happened johnson said i think our 
effort was a good effort and were showing that americans would like 
to come here im not speaking as a politician veterans want to 
come back and see this country for personal reasons 
even though the marines did not represent the united states 
officially they were put in a government guest house and met with 
high officials 
by contrast they also went to a cafe one night and drank beer 
with vietnamese veterans 
when we left they told us the wars over and theyre very 
happy to see us johnson said they embraced us and they almost 
kind of held on as we were trying to walk away we had meetings like 
that with people on the street 
kimball said we have no political objective or agenda we 
dont come with any selfserving motives i think all the men have a 
real heartfelt burden to do something constructive to reconcile and 
to heal the lingering wounds 
bowen stood at the foot of nui ba den a forbidding mountain 
around which many americans died and reflected 
i just had a lot of memories i lost friends i wanted to come 
back just to honor their memories to affirm they were here 
the war was a long time ago sometimes its like was the war 
real

a stinging cold wave continued sunday in 
alaska prompting travel warnings and leaving some isolated villages 
with dwindling fuel and other supplies and little relief was in 
sight a meteorologist said 
mcgrath a community 150 miles west of mount mckinley was the 
states coldest spot with the temperature plummeting to 64 degrees 
below zero late in the day in anchorage it was 30 degrees below 
zero the coldest january day since 1975 the national weather 
service reported 
records were set at tatalina minus 51 kodiak minus 15 healy 
minus 52 and homer minus 24 fairbanks reported 47 below zero 
prudhoe bay on the arctic ocean reported 51 degrees below zero 
the windchill factor at cantwell was 125 degrees below zero 
making the heavily traveled parks highway between fairbanks and 
wasilla unsafe because of the threat the cold could make cars break 
down and strand motorists without heat state troopers said sunday 
the severe cold grounded small planes keeping supplies and 
repair people from reaching some isolated communities 
the extreme cold can congeal lubricants in differentials and 
transmissions freeze tires and freeze coolant in radiators 
anchorage police said they rushed to answer calls about stalled 
vehicles its too cold to be left sitting in a car said a 
spokeswoman 
it appeared to be warming up a few degrees in some parts of 
alaskas interior said meteorologist pat poole of the national 
weather service 
in some places youre talking 10 degrees warmer its like 50 
below he said but every 10 degrees is important 
however he said there was no substantial relief in sight at 
least in the fiveday forecast from the week of extreme cold caused 
by a highpressure area over alaskas interior 
theres a new highpressure area thats moving down across the 
northern siberian coast poole said itll be coming in over 
alaska in the next few days im sure its going to be pretty cold 
firefighters called out to battle several blazes sunday in 
anchorage had frozen pumps on their trucks and other coldrelated 
problems a spokeswoman said most of our fires are being caused 
by people trying to thaw pipes she said 
the american red cross opened emergency shelters at port graham 
on the kenai peninsula and in anchorage about a dozen people stayed 
in the anchorage facility mostly victims of frozen pipes officials 
said 
plumbers were doing land office business 
you cant get a plumber for the price of gold said 
veterinarian joyce murphy who was trying to thaw pipes in her home 
sunday you cant find one 
chuck renfro owner of curtis plumbing and heating in eagle 
river said he had been getting 150 calls a day since the cold snap 
started a week ago this is some kind of record for us he said 
refueling of aircraft at anchorage international airport was 
slowed during the weekend by frigid temperatures and balky hydraulic 
systems several freight flights were canceled and 270 passengers 
aboard a northwest airlines flight from chicago to tokyo were 
stranded after landing in anchorage to refuel one of the engines 
jammed officials said 
a list of coldrelated problems released by state emergency 
services officials included dwindling fuel supplies congealed 
heating fuel frozen water and sewer lines and nondelivery of 
checks and federal food stamps 
telephone communications with akhiok buckland eek kongingig 
port moller selawik and whittier were cut off because the 
communities dieselpowered generators were out of fuel or out of 
order said alascom spokesman tom jensen 
communications with about 30 other communities were impaired 
jensen said 
various school districts opened their buildings to people in need 
of shelter 
in bethel the kuskokwim 300 sled dog race scheduled to start 
thursday was postponed until at least monday by the cold the first 
such delay in the races 10year history

investigators have identified one of two 
women whose severely beaten bodies were found in a rural area as the 
mother of a boy who was found abandoned a few hours later in a 
neighboring county 
the other woman has not been conclusively identified but denton 
county and wise county authorities and the texas rangers are trying 
to determine if she is the mother of a 14monthold girl who also 
was found wandering alone and is the cousin of the young boy 
two brothers who are the estranged husbands of the two 
childrens mothers were being questioned by investigators saturday 
night but denton county sheriff kirby robinson would not say if 
they were being considered suspects in the slayings of the women 
the woman who has been identified through fingerprints on file 
with the texas department of public safety is claudia medina 22 
officials say she and the other woman were bludgeoned with some sort 
of pipe and left in a culvert near decatur in rural wise county 
about 30 miles northwest of fort worth 
ms medina has been identified as the mother of a small boy found 
alone in denton county north of dallas on thursday damion medina 
gamez had his first birthday on the day his mothers battered body 
was found 
the two brothers being questioned have been identified as damion 
gamez the boys father and silvio rojas gamez the father of 
14monthold silvia rojas gamez 
the girls mother is erlinda martinez gamez authorities said 
robinson said at a news conference that investigators began 
searching for the two brothers on saturday night after a man 
identified only as pablo said he thought he knew the two slain women 
according to robinson pablo is a neighbor of the women and had 
seen them the night before they were found dead 
robinson said the women were seen leaving their frisco residence 
in a vehicle and at least one of the children was seen leaving with 
them 
the gamez brothers who are both construction workers turned 
themselves in to authorities after investigators began searching in 
frisco and little elm for them the two men told police their wives 
and small children were missing robinson said 
frisco police chief roger wingo said the search was conducted in 
that area because the brothers had listed residences there during 
previous arrests for public intoxication in his city 
the children have been in foster care since they were found 
caseworker leigh ann pulley said the boy had seemed to be in good 
spirits and was saying momma but the girl had been silent

a fifth of all senior federal judges including 
former chief justice warren e burger stand to collect their largest 
pay raises in a decade even though they no longer handle any court 
cases the associated press has learned 
this windfall increasing burgers salary by 60000 to 175000 
a year for example stems from a complex retirement system that 
allows federal judges to reduce their caseloads sharply while still 
qualifying for activeduty pay increases in stepping down from 
fulltime duty they accept a title of senior judge 
aside from burger the 305 other senior judges also stand to see 
their salaries rise by about 50 percent unless congress disapproves 
the package of raises for top federal officials 
judges who retire through resignation the other option provided 
by congress keep for life the same salary they received on their 
last day of work in burgers case it would have been 108400 
senior status is the vastly more popular option and experts 
believe the federal court system might be hopelessly clogged without 
the parttime contributions of these jurists 
but administrative records obtained by the ap indicate that 
roughly one in five of the nations 306 senior judges do no judicial 
work whatsoever they get the raises but are as hard to find on the 
bench as the 13 former judges who chose full retirement through 
resignation 
it doesnt seem fair said rep carlos moorhead a member of 
a house subcommittee overseeing the federal judiciary the 
california republican whose skepticism last year sidetracked a bill 
to lower the eligibility age for senior status said we need to 
look into this much further congress may want to study 
establishing some minimum work to qualify for the raises he 
said 
as the law stands now there is no such minimum a senior judge 
may work as much or as little as he wants a federal judge 
cannot be forced to resign the constitution says a judicial 
appointment is for life 
under recommendations by thenpresident reagan the highestpaid 
federal officials will receive their largest raises in a decade on 
feb 8 if congress does not disapprove 
comparatively unnoticed in the political controversy over the 50 
percent congressional pay raise are equal increases for federal 
trial judges and raises nearly as generous for the rest of the 
judiciary 
federal district judges would see their salaries rise from 
89500 to 135000 appellate judges from 95000 to 140000 and 
supreme court justices from 110000 to 165000 senior judges get 
the same salaries 
stephen gillers professor of legal ethics at new york 
university said he saw no ethical problem for the nonworking 
senior judges but it may be the statute should be changed it may 
be unwise or bad management its a question whether the public is 
getting its moneys worth 
congress created the senior judge category in 1919 by luring 
older jurists out of their lifetime appointments lawmakers hoped to 
ease court workloads and open jobs for younger appointees to the 
bench 
in large measure senior judges pitch in just as congress 
intended 
as a group they handle between 10 and 15 percent of all federal 
cases the federal judiciary would be a mess without the help of 
senior judges said frank coffin an appeals court judge from 
portland maine who plans to maintain a substantial caseload once 
he claims senior status 
some like 91yearold elbert p tuttle of atlanta are on the 
bench almost as often as their 750 active colleagues tuttle does 
about 70 percent as much work as the active judges in the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals according to circuit executive norman 
zoller 
the associated press obtained a copy of the only public report on 
the subject of senior judge workloads compiled by the 
administrative office of the courts identifying each senior judge 
only by a code number with no names listed the report showed that 
in the year ending june 30 1987 56 of 271 senior judges or 21 
percent handled no cases forty nine of the 56 were over 75 years 
old 
david cook who keeps track of such statistics for the office 
said office policy bars him from releasing information on individual 
judges by name or more recent coded data but he said if you did 
the survey today i dont think things would be much different 
senior status is available to any judge who is at least 65 with 
15 years experience or 70 with 10 years there are now a total of 
306 including burger and cook said the patterns found in 1987 are 
not out of date 
for those senior judges who do not work reasons can differ 
dramatically 
james noel jr a senior judge in houston performed his last 
judicial duty in 1978 when his annual salary was 54500 80500 a 
year less than the salary he stands to begin receiving next month 
noel 79 took senior status in 1976 when he was 66 after 15 
years as a federal trial judge asked why he chose senior status and 
not resignation noel told ap it was just a matter of choice 
noel regularly travels to his downtown office to manage his 
extensive investments when asked about his impending pay raise 
noel said i was expecting it 
owen cox appointed as a federal trial judge in texas by 
president nixon in 1970 took senior status in 1981 jesse clark 
the district courts clerk said cox did substantial work for most 
of a year until his health failed and he had difficulty getting to 
the office 
hes been hospitalized for three years hes on a lifesupport 
system clark said 
coxs salary would rise to 135000 next month had he resigned 
in 1981 his salary would have been frozen at 67100 
burger left the supreme court bench in september 1986 to serve as 
unpaid chairman of the commission celebrating the bicentennials of 
the constitution and bill of rights he declined to answer questions 
about his impending pay increase and his judicial workload other 
than to pass along that im too busy to sit 
when he retired his salary was 108400 had he resigned 
burgers annual salary would have been frozen for life at that 
figure but burger who has spent much of his career campaigning for 
higher salaries for judges chose senior status as a result he 
qualifies for whatever pay raises are extended to his successors as 
chief justice 
in 1987 the chief justices salary was raised to 115000 and 
burger got the increase along with chief justice william rehnquist 
under the new proposal rehnquist and burger each would be paid 
175000 
supreme court spokeswoman toni house said burger has not been 
asked to hear any cases because she presumed rehnquist is aware 
that burger works fulltime as chairman of the bicentennial 
commission 
by contrast rehnquist assigned former supreme court justice 
lewis powell to serve on the 4th us circuit court of appeals in 
richmond va powell also will sit next month on the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals in florida 
as a lawyer and law teacher i would be troubled if judges were 
being paid for doing nothing and getting increments for doing 
nothing unless congress made a conscious decision that even judges 
in total retirement should get pay raises professor gillers said 
he said nothing in law or judicial standards makes it unethical 
for a senior judge to do no work and collect pay raises 
i cant speak to the personal propriety he said every 
judge has to make that decision for himself 
coffin the federal appeals court judge said its a good 
theoretical question whether the system is fair if there were 
more frequent pay raises for judges id be more bothered

elbert p tuttle a fabled champion of civil 
rights became a federal judge in georgia at age 57 hes 91 now 
and the south is a very different place but hes still on the bench 
he is an amazing man a national treasure said norman 
zoller circuit executive for the atlantabased 11th us circuit 
court of appeals 
in his 1981 book unlikely heroes author jack bass named 
tuttle as one of four federal appellate judges most responsible for 
racially desegregating the south by building on a landmark 1954 
supreme court decision 
bass described the bald bespectacled tuttle as a quiet 
somewhat formal and unfailingly courteous man who practices 
oldfashioned virtues 
tuttle now a senior judge still carries about 70 percent of the 
normal caseload for an active judge on the 11th circuit court he 
and his wife sara still live in georgia 
tuttle once summarized his own philosophy in a speech to law 
students the professional man is in essence one who provides 
service he said like love talent is only useful in its 
expenditure and it is never exhausted but never confuse the 
performance which is great with the compensation be it money 
power or fame which is trivial

vickie schenk is breathing easier these 
days now that a piece of metal that was lodged in her right lung 
for 36 years has been removed 
the 41yearold belleville woman inhaled the foilthin piece of 
1by1 inch aluminum when she was 5 and forgot about it 
about three years later she began to develop breathing and 
health problems they lasted until july when doctors at st marys 
hospital medical center discovered the piece of metal and removed it 
the last three years or so were really bad every six weeks or 
so i was going to the doctor for some type of chest infection or 
cold said ms schenk an attendant at a health care center near 
her southern wisconsin hometown 
ms schenk and her mother victoria said they remembered ms 
schenk inhaling the piece of metal which had been to wrap a ribbon 
or lace 
i came up to her one day when she was playing with her dolls 
outside and asked her what she was chewing on victoria schenk 
said she swallowed it right there like any other kid that 
swallows something like a nickel it usually passes and you forget 
about it 
ms schenk said she forgot about the incident and never linked it 
to her health problems because of the time lapse and the incidence 
of asthma in her family 
in the years that followed ms schenk began to suffer chronic 
coughing during strenuous activity or in the middle of the night 
the coughing fits some of which would last for 45 minutes led 
to frequent and lengthy bouts of wheezing and shortness of breath 
vickie schenk said 
she underwent years of allergy shots to alleviate her problems 
she had been on medication including steriods for most of her 
life because of this said dr william donovan a lung specialist 
the disability kept ms schenk out of strenuous school activities 
during her childhood she exercised in an effort to strengthen her 
lungs but most of the time wound up coughing painfully 
its unbelievable ive had hundreds of xrays in my life and 
it the metal never showed up ms schenk said 
the object probably never showed up because there was fluid 
around it giving it a density similar to body tissue and because 
aluminum is sometimes not as easily detected by xrays doctors said 
last july she developed a severe infection that required surgery 
to drain fluid from between her lungs and ribs 
when doctors performed a bronchoscopy in which a lit tube is 
inserted down the throat to look into the lungs doctors saw the 
object and surgically removed it 
when we took it out we still didnt know if her problems were 
over she could have had asthma anyway but she has had no problems 
since then donovan said

knocking objects off walls but no major damage or injuries were 
reported authorities said 
the quake was centered about 140 miles south of salt lake city 
16 miles southeast of the central utah community of salina and had 
a magnitude of 54 on the richter scale said russ needham a 
geophysicist with the us geological surveys national earthquake 
information service in golden colo 
it was pretty strong it was knocking stuff off the walls 
said utah highway patrol dispatcher marty estrada in price about 70 
miles southwest of the epicenter 
weve got people checking for damages right now but we havent 
heard any actual reports of damages he said 
the quake which occurred at 906 pm mst was felt by residents 
from salt lake city south to moab and as far east as grand junction 
colo and rock springs wyo said sue nava senior staff 
seismologist at the university of utah seismograph stations in salt 
lake city 
the quake also was felt in northern arizona said the information 
service in golden which characterized the quake as moderate 
the most recent quake of significant size in utah was a temblor 
of magnitude 53 that occurred aug 14 and was centered 48 miles 
southwest of sundays quake nava said 
seismograph stations director walter arabasz said utahns could 
feel some aftershocks in the ensuing hours 
from historical experience theres about a 2 percent chance 
that an earthquake of this size would be followed by a larger 
earthquake he said 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight damage 
in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 6 
severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage

a fifth of all senior federal judges including 
former chief justice warren e burger stand to collect their largest 
pay raises in a decade even though they no longer handle any court 
cases the associated press has learned 
this windfall increasing burgers salary by 60000 to 175000 
a year stems from a retirement system allowing federal judges to 
reduce their caseloads sharply while still qualifying for 
activeduty pay increases in stepping down from fulltime duty 
they accept a title of senior judge 
aside from burger the 305 other senior judges also stand to see 
their salaries rise by about 50 percent unless congress disapproves 
the raises due for top federal officials on feb 8 
judges who retire through resignation the other option provided 
by congress keep for life the same salary they received on their 
last day of work in burgers case it would have been 108400 
senior status is the vastly more popular option burger for 
example already has received one raise in 1987 to 115000 
administrative records obtained by the ap indicate that roughly 
one in five of the nations senior judges do no judicial work 
whatsoever they get the raises but are as hard to find on the bench 
as the 13 former judges who chose full retirement 
it doesnt seem fair said rep carlos moorhead a member of 
a house subcommittee overseeing the federal judiciary the 
california republican whose skepticism last year sidetracked a bill 
to lower the eligibility age for senior status said congress may 
want to consider establishing some minimum work to qualify for the 
raises 
as the law stands now a senior judge may turn down any work he 
doesnt want a federal judge cannot be forced to resign the 
constitution says a judicial appointment is for life 
stephen gillers a new york university legal ethics professor 
said he sees no ethical problem for the nonworking senior judges 
but it may be the statute should be changed it may be unwise or 
bad management its a question whether the public is getting its 
moneys worth 
congress created the senior judge category in 1919 to ease court 
workloads and open jobs for younger appointees by luring older 
judges out of their lifetime appointments 
in large measure senior judges pitch in just as congress 
intended 
as a group they handle between 10 and 15 percent of all federal 
cases the federal judiciary would be a mess without the help of 
senior judges said frank coffin an appeals court judge from 
portland maine 
some like 91yearold elbert p tuttle of atlanta are on the 
bench almost as often as their 750 active colleagues tuttle does 
about 70 percent as much work as any of the active judges in his 
circuit according to circuit executive norman zoller 
the associated press obtained a copy of the only public report on 
senior judge workloads compiled by the administrative office of the 
courts identifying each senior judge only by a code number with no 
names listed the report showed that in the year ending june 30 
1987 56 of 271 senior judges or 21 percent handled no cases 
forty nine of the 56 were over 75 years old 
david cook who compiles the statistics said office policy bars 
him from releasing information on individual judges by name or more 
recent coded data but he said if you did the survey today i 
dont think things would be much different 
cook said the 1987 patterns are not out of date 
for those senior judges who do not work reasons can differ 
dramatically 
james noel jr a senior judge in houston performed his last 
judicial duty in 1978 when his annual salary was 54500 80500 a 
year less than he stands to begin receiving next month 
noel 79 took senior status in 1976 when he was 66 after 15 
years as a federal trial judge asked why he chose senior status and 
not resignation noel said it was just a matter of choice 
senior status is available to any judge who is at least age 65 
with 15 years experience or 70 with 10 years 
noel regularly uses his downtown office to manage his extensive 
investments when asked about his impending pay raise noel said 
i was expecting it 
owen cox a federal trial judge in texas since 1970 took senior 
status in 1981 jesse clark the district courts clerk said cox 
did substantial work until his health failed 
hes been hospitalized for three years hes on a lifesupport 
system clark said 
coxs salary would rise to 135000 next month had he resigned 
his salary would have been frozen at 67100 
burger left the supreme court in september 1986 to serve as 
fulltime but unpaid chairman of the commission celebrating the 
bicentennial of the constitution burger who has spent much of his 
career campaigning for higher judicial salaries declined to answer 
questions about his own impending pay increase and his judicial 
workload other than to say im too busy to sit 
gillers said nothing in law or judicial standards makes it 
unethical for a senior judge to do no work and collect pay raises 
i cant speak to the personal propriety he said every 
judge has to make that decision for himself

outlets fitzwater said 
brady 48 who has held a variety of government jobs since coming 
to washington in 1968 as a communications consultant to the house 
is entitled to a government pension 
he was shot in the head on march 30 1981 during an attempt on

president 
he reported to the white house about one day a week to visit with 
associates sign autographs and pose for pictures 
deputy press secretary larry speakes became the chief white house 
spokesman with the title of principal deputy press secretary when 
speakes resigned in 1987 fitzwater was named spokesman with the

renewal of a uschina technology agreement is 
being delayed because of chinese opposition to copyright protection 
for computer software and patent protection for drugs american 
officials say 
the decadeold accord is to expire at the end of this month but 
a state department official involved with the talks said it is 
likely the earlier pact will be extended in hopes of reaching 
agreement through additional negotiations 
this official who spoke on condition that he not be identified 
said it was too strong to say the talks were at an impasse 
weve exchanged information and talked a lot but weve only 
had one negotiating session he said we certainly anticipate 
that well have some additional negotiating sessions trying to 
bring our positions closer together 
he said further talks are expected next month in beijing 
following up on a session held in washington on jan 1213 
at that meeting the delegations were headed by peter j de vos 
deputy assistant secretary of state for science and technology 
affairs and duan ruichun deputy director of chinas department of 
science and technology 
president bush will be traveling to china next month but there 
is no indication whether the science and technology agreement is 
among the issues he plans to raise with the chinese 
the chinese have taken the position that there is no provision in 
their law for copyright protection of computer software they made 
it clear that they would not sign any agreement that said we agree 
that software is protected by copyright said marybeth peters an 
official with the us copyright office 
they told us they will not enact any kind of a law at this 
point and maybe in the future that says computer software is 
protected by copyright and even in the agreement it may not say 
copyright ms peters said 
the chinese have contended that software exporters should rely on 
contracts with buyers to protect their programs 
that position has drawn sharp criticism from the computer and 
business equipment manufacturers association a washingtonbased 
computer industry trade group which points to a growing number of 
complaints about software piracy in china 
contracts do nothing to impede thirdparty infringers said 
john l pickitt president of cbema the most effective and 
internationally accepted protection for software is copyright 
some us software manufacturers have responded to the stalemate 
over copyright by deciding to halt further sales in china 
the risks for us software exporters may have risen to a level 
where participation in the prc peoples republic of china market 
is not justified for them pickitt said 
on pharmaceuticals chinese patent law will protect the specific 
process for manufacturing a drug but not the drug itself 
ms peters said that since in many cases there are many ways of 
processing the same drug that really is not very effective 
protection

a private conservationist says federal programs 
are already having an impact on soil erosion but there are some 
fears that the agriculture department may have trouble enforcing the 
rules in the future 
one other area of concern is the old problem of city sprawl of 
rapidly growing roads parking lots and housing tracts eating up 
millions of acres of some of the nations best farmland 
robert j gray policy director for the nonprofit 
washingtonbased american farmland trust said the jury is still 
out on how strict usda will be in enforcing the 1985 farm laws 
requirements to protect land and water resources 
among others those require farmers to have conservation plans 
completed to help protect and land and water resources or risk 
losing price supports and other federal benefits 
they claim that they are going to have all the plans in place 
by 1990 gray said last week 
grays comments followed release of an updated usda report 
outlining goals through 1997 at the top was soil erosion a 
longstanding priority with water quality given equal ranking 
the report said the 1985 laws conservation reserve program or 
crp which calls for 40 million to 45 million acres of highly 
erodible cropland to be planted with protective grass and trees by 
the end of 1990 already is saving 530 million tons of soil each 
year thus reducing total erosion by 15 percent 
by 1995 the report said crp could be saving 800 million tons of 
soil annually 
it they do that then were almost a third reduction in 
erosion which is really significant gray said 
the final report didnt make a big point of land loss to urban 
development but neither did it reject some of the assertions made 
when a draft of the report was released for public review in 1987 
in the 1987 document usda said city sprawl and other 
nonagricultural uses were gobbling up farmland at an annual rate 
that could equal the size of missouri by the year 2030 
about 15 million acres are converted to nonagricultural use 
each year and 64 percent of that is cropland at that rate the 
1987 report said the nations cropland base could be reduced by 
nearly 48 million acres or 12 percent between 1982 and 2030 
gray said the figures in the draft report are still meaningful 
and of concern to many professionals some authorities have 
discounted the creep of roads housing parks and other 
nonagricultural uses on grounds that the united states has much 
land that could be put into food production if needed 
one of the arguments includes the crp land itself millions of 
acres that are being taken from production for 10 years but gray 
said those acres for the most part are marginal to begin with land 
that is too fragile for crop use 
meanwhile he said when cities grow or new roads are needed 
those spread across farmland whether its marginal or prime and 
its often some of the best most productive land in the area

an analysis by the agriculture department shows 
that the nations farmerowned cooperatives still have a long way to 
go in recovering from the sharp business declines of recent years 
in calendar 1987 according to an annual review coop business 
volume rose slightly to 593 billion from 584 billion in 1986 
but that was still far below the record high of 73 billion reached 
in 1984 
randall e torgerson administrator of the departments 
agricultural cooperative service said the 1987 increase was held 
down mostly by the reduced number of crop acres in production that 
year 
overall prices received by farmers in 1987 were up slightly but 
the number of cooperatives continued a long downward trend 
total coop business volume includes marketing or the value of 
products sold the sales of farm supplies such as fertilizer 
chemicals fuels and feed and receipts from services such as 
trucking storage grain drying and ginning 
torgerson said the drop in the number of farm cooperatives to 
5174 in 1987 from 5369 in 1986 was due mainly to reorganizations 
including mergers consolidations and acquisitions and to some 
coops going out of business 
memberships totaled 439 million in 1987 about the same as in 
1986 many farmers belong to more than one coop 
the average membership per coop increased to an average of 848 
in 1987 from 820 the previous year

thailand is a major producer of tobacco in asia 
as well as an established market for the united states although 
there is great uncertainty about future sales says an 
agriculture department report 
unlike some of its neighbors in asia where trade liberalization 
has already led to widespread structural changes thailands 
cigarette industry still enjoys the protection afforded by a virtual 
ban on imports the report said as a result a thriving black 
market exists in higher quality foreign cigarettes 
the report by the departments foreign agricultural service said 
cigarette use is increasing in thailand and may have accelerated 
last year by as much as 10 percent from 1987

for 12 years george bush dreamed and worked to 
reach the heights of his chosen profession now he is there and 
like many others who go from being no 2 to being no 1 he 
sometimes finds himself ill at ease 
not often he says 
theres still the wonder of it all bush said at his first 
presidential news conference friday it still feels different but 
not surprising 
hes enjoying the job said presidential press secretary 
marlin fitzwater the only problem is containing his enthusiasm 
but sometimes 
there are a couple of examples including one that bush told on 
himself 
minutes after he took his oath at the capitol bush told 
congressional leaders he heard the house sergeant at arms call out 
mr president 
as he had for eight years as vice president bush waited for 
president reagan to respond but president reagan was now former 
president reagan the call was for president bush 
a poke in the ribs from first lady barbara bush got the point 
across 
reporters observed the other instance reagan had left bush a 
note in the oval office and they asked the new president to read it 
to them 
before doing so bush turned to fitzwater am i violating any 
rules here marlin he asked 
theyre your rules sir said a reporter 
oh i set the rules bush said then he went on to read the 
note aloud 
so does the new president have the willies 
not at all says fitzwater hes very excited by the whole 
situation 
on the other hand says a political scientist who doubles in 
psychology bush would be an exception to the rule if he didnt 
experience some stress in a job he has tried for so long to get 
psychologically it is often rather overwhelming because their 
whole life is built around the struggle to get there said gary 
weaver a professor of international relations at american 
university who has also taught psychology 
once they get there its over with 
it doesnt seem to be over with for bush who has been setting a 
hectic pace since his inauguration 
but for some said weaver the consequences can be much more 
severe than just forgetting who sets the rules or not realizing who 
is being addressed 
even if you look at articles on suicides of famous people and 
im not suggesting that at all what we do find is that it very 
seldom occurs as they are struggling to get to the top it occurs 
when they get to the top and are overwhelmed 
so although bush certainly has shown no signs as serious as 
that said weaver i guess you could say that for him its 
probably pretty overwhelming because you know hes been struggling 
for a long time and one ought to assume that there would be some 
personality change once he gets there hes not going to be the old 
george bush

two teamsters leaders quit their posts to avoid 
trial in a racketeering case alleging close ties between the union 
and organized crime but the teamsters governing board rejected a 
government proposal to settle the entire case 
the resignations and rejection of the proposed settlement came on 
a weekend that included a hastily arranged saturday meeting in 
washington between teamsters president william j mccarthy and the 
vice presidents of the nations largest union 
it was at that session that the teamsters general executive board 
voted to reject what two union sources said was a proposed 
settlement calling for internal union election reform and the 
resignations of a handful of the vice presidents 
that same day ronald holmes of detroit and john h cleveland of 
washington informed mccarthy they were resigning as vice presidents 
of the 16million member union 
holmes made a public announcement of his decision clevelands 
decision to quit was confirmed privately sunday by a union official 
after a justice department spokeswoman said both men quit as part of 
agreements with prosecutors 
the spokeswoman deborah corley of the us attorneys office in 
new york said holmes and cleveland reached oral agreements with 
prosecutors that they would be dropped as defendants in the suit if 
they resigned 
prosecutors this week will ask a judge to approve the deals ms 
corley said sunday she would neither confirm nor deny the existence 
of a government offer to settle the entire case 
both holmes and cleveland were on the losing side last summer 
when mccarthy defeated union secretarytreasurer weldon mathis in 
the race to succeed jackie presser as teamsters president presser 
before his death had designated mathis as his choice for the job 
but mccarthy won on a 98 vote 
mccarthy of arlington mass was head of the teamsters in new 
england and one of the unions 16 international vice presidents when 
the suit was filed in new york seven months ago 
it alleges that more than two dozen reputed organized crime 
figures have had dealings in teamsters affairs including using mob 
influence to control union elections 
the suit is scheduled for trial feb 27 it asks that the court 
remove the teamsters leadership place the union under trusteeship 
and prohibit the alleged mob figures from any future dealings with 
the union 
twentysix reputed organized crime figures were named in the suit 
but 10 were dropped as defendants last year after signing agreements 
in which they promised to avoid dealings with the union

private contractors are making large profits 
from the federal toxic waste cleanup superfund while government 
supervisors of the project generally are underpaid a congressional 
study reports 
its clear that the superfund program is still falling far 
short of its promise said rep john d dingell chairman of the 
house energy and commerce committee and a persistent critic of the 
us environmental protection agency dingell released the study on 
sunday 
outside contractors have received 4 billion or 80 to 90 percent 
of the superfund money since the program was begun eight years ago 
said the report by the office of technology assessment 
the congressional agency noted that funds for the epa staff 
which oversees the program remained virtually flat while the 
outside spending escalated 
dingell called that a failure of the epa but the ota report 
itself said congress shares the blame noting that the dependence 
on contracting is an outcome of both congressional and epa decisions 
in the early 1980s 
originally there was general agreement that superfund had to 
be implemented quickly and would be only a shortterm program and 
that the necessary technical expertise existed in the private 
sector therefore heavy reliance on contractors seemed to make 
economic and environmental sense 
but we now know that superfund will be needed for many 
decades the report said 
the interim ota report part of a massive superfund study to be 
completed later this year said some cleanup companies have shown 
income growth of 300 percent annually with net income often 
rising at a much higher rate 
the ota said that while much of the actual cleanup work must be 
assigned to contractors too much policy and oversight 
responsibility is being parceled out to the private sector 
contractors do a lot of work in these areas that go far beyond 
supportive information and analysis it said 
meanwhile according to the report there has been a steady 
drain of people with experience and expertise away from government 
to contractors that compromises the environmental performance of 
superfund because it makes it harder for epa to supervise 
contractors adequately 
for example it said one epa regional office reported that 
because of two new large contracts the office expects to lose 20 
percent of its technical staff 
low funding for epa staff in general has resulted in low 
salaries for key superfund people it said some project managers 
make less than 20000 annually even though they may be responsible 
for several sites involving multimilliondollar contractor studies 
and cleanups the report said 
the ota suggested that congress consider temporarily reducing 
superfund spending for contractors by 30 to 50 percent roughly 400 
million to 600 million while beefing up the governments staff

walking through his barn jozef fagard 
slapped the heavily muscled flank of a breeding cow he uses to 
produce hormonefree beef 
skittish calves pressed closer to their mothers on the 170acre 
farm in the ancient town of tongeren 55 miles east of brussels 
fagards special breed of cattle are raised free of the growth 
hormones widely used in the united states but banned in europe 
when european nations refused to accept hormonetreated meat the 
united states retaliated with stiff duties on some european imports 
people want hormonefree food thanks to this breed we can 
compete without giving hormones said fagard whose family has 
been farming in tongeren for more than 200 years 
on jan 1 the european economic community banned imports of beef 
from cattle treated with growth hormones 
the 12nation trading bloc earlier had blocked their use in 
europe because of consumer worries that the additives pose a health 
risk hormones natural and synthetic are injected into animals 
ears to boost growth rates 
in flouting the ban the united states has argued that hormones 
used by its farmers are safe the eec has warned it will impose 
tough tariffs on american walnuts and dried fruit if no progress is 
made by feb 20 to end the dispute 
there is a trade war hanging over us said odiel 
zwaenepoel economic adviser to the belgian boerenbond the farm 
union 
joseph yverneau president of the committee of professional farm 
organizations the umbrella group for farm unions in the common 
market said we dont want a war with the united states but we 
are forced to respond 
without the ban european farmers would be at a competitive 
disadvantage fagard said the farmers also said however the ban 
may be too stringent 
we found the regulation is too severe said yverneau who 
farms in northern france there are certain natural hormones 
which could be authorized 
fagard said the 50 or so calves on his farm if raised with extra 
hormones would weigh about 200 pounds more at the time of slaughter 
hugo schrevens who operates a dairy farm northwest of fagards 
farm said everyone knows you have a better financial result when 
you use hormones 
but fagard said the pressure is such that governments and 
politicians cannot yield to the small group of producers who might 
want to use hormones 
there have been recent cases in europe in which farmers allegedly 
bought hormones on the black market to fatten their cattle the 
farmers interviewed doubted the practice was widespread because of 
stiff penalties for violators 
the hormone ban is expected to block 100 million worth of us 
beef imports a small part of the 166 billion trade estimated 
between the european economic community and the united states last 
year 
it is a miniproblem actually said friedrich rode a german 
farmer and vice president of the european farm organization 
in fact the hormone dispute is overshadowed by a larger fight 
between the united states and europe over farm subsidies 
the united states wants the common market to end import barriers 
and export and domestic subsidies that it says distort trade 
it initially demanded the subsidies be eliminated by the year 
2000 but has since said the date is negotiable

nato troops and arms are increasingly 
unpopular among west germans so it was no surprise when bonn 
officials carefully ducked the issue of modernizing shortrange 
nuclear missiles at a nato defense strategy session 
government sources said privately that chancellor helmut kohl had 
instructed senior west german officials attending the annual 
conference to stay mum on whether bonn supports extending the range 
of battlefield nuclear missiles 
most of the defense experts taking part in the weekend conference 
strongly support the 1983 plan adopted by the north atlantic treaty 
organization to improve the missiles chief among them the lance 
which was first introduced in 1972 and has a range of just over 60 
miles 
they also appeared to support us calls for a cautious response 
to kremlin disarmament initiatives though the conference did not 
produce a statement 
the issue is extremely sensitive for the bonn government which 
is unlikely to shirk its commitments within the 16nation alliance 
by openly opposing modernization despite strong public opposition 
but by remaining silent on the issue the bonn leadership may be 
encouraging unrealistic hopes among west german voters that the 
modernization question is still open it was left to leftwing west 
german politicians to speak out on the issue at the conference and 
they voiced resistance 
members of the opposition social democratic party told the group 
of 171 nato defense experts that west germans oppose modernization 
and have serious problems with the size of the nato force posted in 
their country 
as soviet president mikhail s gorbachev gains in popularity 
among west germans 71 percent give him a favorable rating public 
support for defense spending and the nato troop presence has waned 
most conference delegates attacked what they saw as a dangerous 
complacency that could weaken defenses 
us defense secretarydesignate john tower told the conference 
that natoshould maintain a healthy skepticism about kremlin 
disarmament overtures and keep the wests nuclear options open 
the texas republican said the alliance runs the risk of 
mortgaging its security if it fails to modernize its nuclear forces 
because of perceived improvements in relations with moscow 
tower said the soviet union remains a powerful adversary with 
superior military capability and the west must not lose sight of 
that imbalance in its euphoria over disarmament prospects 
if we fail to consider that capability or if we fail to 
consider its relevance in terms of their intentions then we do so 
at our peril he said 
social democrats like egon bahr the partys arms control expert 
and karsten voigt drew fire from american participants when they 
explained many west germans are increasingly critical of nato 
doctrine 
even defense minister rupert scholz mentioned his countrys 
concerns about the possibility of having to share a greater burden 
of the nato budget though he avoided mentioning modernization 
tower met privately with scholz on sunday morning but apparently 
accomplished little in the way of persuading his allied counterpart 
to show stronger support for nato policy 
we just illuminated some problems we didnt come to any 
solutions tower told the associated press after the meeting 
he declined to say what particular issues were covered or whether 
he was able to get an assurance from the west german minister that 
bonn would support modernization 
the west germans also were taken to task for their response to 
us intelligence reports alleging that west german companies helped 
libya develop a chemical weapons potential 
sen john mccain rariz accused bonn of benign neglect in 
the libyan scandal and suggested senior west german officials have 
been lying to cover up their culpability 
on sunday the conference focused on the new and mounting threats 
to alliance unity posed by gorbachevs charm offensive in the 
west 
nato secretary general manfred woerner raised the concern voiced 
by many other influential defense strategists that gorbachev could 
fail and be replaced by a far more conservative leader 
we cannot entrust our security to one person alone or to 
intentions woerner said both can change overnight 
britains defense secretary george younger warned that the west 
was being offered disarmament by the leader of the nation that has 
been arming and rearming for years

president daniel ortega can expect 
little support from nicaraguas business community support he 
sorely needs to salvage an economy in crisis as he unveils his 
governments economic plan for 1989 
the austerity package ortega was to announce today reportedly 
includes a threemonth wage and price freeze aimed at curbing 
inflation which the president says reached 20000 percent last year 
the sandinista government has desperately sought the support of 
capitalists and workers to brake nicaraguas rapid slide into 
economic chaos 
theres a general awareness that the problem belongs to the 
whole country and that the government alone cannot rescue the 
economy said bayardo arce a member of the ruling sandinista 
national directorate 
we must establish a harmony of interests outlining the 
responsibilities of the government private enterprise and workers 
so we can face the countrys problems he said in an interview 
on dec 31 the president announced sweeping budget cuts for the 
defense ministry and security forces the government has not said 
how many jobs will be eliminated as a result of the cuts 
opposition leader enrique bolanos a cotton grower and former 
president of the superior council of private enterprise said 
nicaraguan business leaders would not support the plan because they 
distrust the sandinistas 
the government is saying to us were drowning toss us a 
lifesaver bolanos said in an interview but this time all 
were going to throw them is an anvil so they finish sinking 
ortega has fared little better with labor organizations 
a meeting saturday between ortega and labor groups that was to be 
open to the news media suddenly was closed indicating negotiations 
were not going as smoothly as the president had hoped 
during a similar meeting jan 15 which was open to the media 
labor leaders complained about numerous layoffs of government 
workers 
sharp currency devaluations and official price hikes have cut 
nicaraguans purchasing power this month the official exchange 
rate has gone from 920 cordobas to the dollar to 2300 cordobas per 
dollar the minimum wage is 3748 cordobas a day about 163 
the price of a liter of milk rose from about 54 cents at the 
beginning of the month to 87 cents effective today a gallon of 
gasoline sells for 208 up from 87 cents 
the sandinistas blame nicaraguas economic crisis on the war with 
ussupported contra rebels that began in 1981 the two sides 
signed a tentative ceasefire in march but a permanent truce 
remains elusive 
the government also says nicaraguas economy has suffered from a 
us trade embargo imposed in 1985 and hurricane joan which 
devastated the country in october 
opposition leaders cite poor government management and planning 
for the state of the economy 
since riding a 1979 revolution to power the sandinistas have 
seized many private businesses and foreign and domestic investment 
has plummeted under us pressure western lending agencies have 
halted nicaraguas access to funds because of its ties to the soviet 
union

the city and a grand jury are investigating 
allegations that the phone company and police illegally wiretapped 
hundreds of phones including those of black muslims a federal 
judge and a billionaire 
the taps the subject of a us district court trial that began 
last month allegedly were placed to allow police to monitor 
investigations and to eavesdrop on suspected subversives 
there are allegations that these things happened 10 years ago 
but i have a feeling that the evidentiary trail is cold said 
mayor charles luken the city doesnt have any records to indicate 
that these things happened 
still the mayor has directed city manager scott johnson to 
conduct an internal investigation into charges that a secret 
cincinnati police intelligence unit cooperated with cincinnati bell 
telephone co on illegal wiretaps a federal grand jury also is 
investigating the allegations 
johnson said friday he planned to hire private investigators to 
help with the probe 
but two of the nine city council members democrat peter 
strauss and republican john mirlisena are calling for a special 
prosecutor contending that the citys plans are inadequate 
to give it credibility it should be totally independent the 
only time our people should be in the room is when they are being 
questioned mirlisena said 
cincinnati bell and its parent company cincinnati bell inc 
deny knowledge of such illegal eavesdropping or that they 
participated in or authorized any such activity 
the allegations were raised by two former cincinnati bell 
employees leonard gates a supervisor fired in 1986 for 
insubordination and exrepairman robert draise who quit as part of 
a plea bargain in 1979 after he was charged in connection with an 
illegal wiretap 
gates and draise said cincinnati bell security officials ordered 
them to install more than 1200 illegal wiretaps between 1972 and 
1984 the men said the wiretaps were put in place to help security 
supervisors and cincinnati police 
those whose telephones allegedly were tapped include a black 
muslim organization us district judge carl rubin of cincinnati 
and billionaire cincinnati financier carl lindner jr 
police officials have denied the wiretapping 
but former policemen harold mills gary simpson and elmer 
dunaway and former hamilton county commissioner allen paul last 
year filed a 112 million lawsuit against cincinnati bell inc its 
officers and directors and the phone company alleging that their 
phones were illegally tapped 
the lawsuit whose us district court trial began in december 
was filed as a class action on behalf of everyone whose telephones 
might be shown to have been illegally tapped 
cincinnati bell during the past two weeks responded with two 
countersuits seeking a total of 4 million countersuit one of the 
countersuits denies any involvement in illegal wiretaps the other 
accuses gates and draise of lying and trying to hurt the company 
gates and draise responded that cincinnati bell is merely trying 
to get back at them for making their allegations public 
the 112 million lawsuit recently was amended to include the city 
as a defendant the city filed a motion jan 26 denying the 
allegations and asking that the lawsuit be dismissed 
in a deposition police sgt howard cade a former member of the 
secret police intelligence unit said he participated in four 
wiretaps while working for the intelligence unit cade a 23year 
officer now assigned to the police communications section said he 
knew of no court authorizations for the wiretaps 
only federal judges may authorize installations of electronic 
eavesdropping equipment 
cade reportedly received immunity from prosecution in exchange 
for testifying before the federal grand jury 
some of the revelations in the depositions have been leaked to 
cincinnati news media lawyers for cincinnati bell and the city have 
asked us district judge david dowd jr to seal the depositions 
from public access pending the trial lawyers for the news media 
oppose those efforts

americans favor tough new antiterrorist 
measures including military strikes to combat attacks against 
international flights but most say poor airplane maintenance is a 
greater threat a poll has found 
the national media generalassociated press survey found that a 
majority backed us military strikes against countries that support 
terrorists only if the support were proved and innocent civilians 
were not killed 
the poll found opinion sharply divided on whether military 
retaliation would deter terrorists or spur them but a majority said 
the government can stem terrorism and 57 percent said it is not 
doing enough now 
the survey of 1162 adults had a 3point margin of error it was 
conducted jan 412 after a terrorist bomb downed pan am flight 103 
over scotland killing 270 people 
in response to the bombing the federal aviation administration 
ordered us airlines to xray all checked baggage on flights from 
europe and the mideast the poll found support for other steps some 
considerably tougher 
ninetysix percent said foreign airlines should be required to 
xray checked baggage 
nearly threequarters favored requiring airlines to handsearch 
all checked baggage on international flights even if that meant 
passengers had to check in three hours early that is the practice 
on el al israels airline which has long experience in 
antiterrorism efforts 
half of those polled supported banning carryon luggage on 
international flights such a ban has been used sporadically by 
british airways on flights into belfast northern ireland during 
times of political tension 
the survey also found some sentiment for greater public 
disclosure of terrorist threats against airlines even if the 
threats are frequent and unverifiable 
that issue arose when it was revealed that us officials had 
been warned before the pan am attack that a bombing was imminent 
but did not publicly reveal the threat officials said later that 
announcing the threats could cripple the airline industry because 
warnings virtually are received daily 
respondents were split evenly on the question asked if the 
government should announce all terrorist threats it receives against 
airlines even if it gets them daily and cannot tell if they are 
legitimate 45 percent said yes 45 percent said no the rest 
werent sure 
however 57 percent said the airlines should be required to 
announce all terrorist threats they receive thirtyeight percent 
opposed such a requirement the rest had no opinion 
even with their support for tougher security and disclosure by 
airlines of threats respondents did not view terrorism as the chief 
danger to air travelers a solid 64 percent said inadequate 
maintenance poses a greater danger while just 24 percent chose 
terrorism as the greater hazard twelve percent had no opinion 
on military responses to terrorism 55 percent said the united 
states should strike against other nations if it has proof they 
supported terrorists who attacked americans that sentiment spanned 
ideologies but was backed more strongly by men 64 percent than 
women 45 percent 
still nearly a third of those who supported military strikes 
said they would change their view if the action might kill innocent 
people that left just 33 percent overall favoring retaliatory 
strikes in which civilians could die 
moreover an overwhelming 84 percent opposed military retaliation 
if the united states lacked direct proof of another nations 
involvement even if us officials believed the other country was 
involved 
opinion was split on the efficacy of military retaliation nearly 
onethird said striking countries that support terrorism would only 
increase the number of terrorist attacks while a third said it 
would be a deterrent the rest either said it would have no effect 
or had no opinion 
nonetheless 61 percent said the united states can take steps to 
reduce terrorist attacks significantly and only 31 percent said the 
government is doing all it can now to protect americans from 
terrorism

at the height of the cuban missile crisis fidel 
castro was convinced a us invasion was imminent and urgently asked 
soviet leader nikita s khrushchev to launch an immediate nuclear 
strike against the united states a key soviet source reportedly 
told some american colleagues 
the cuban leader was said to have sent his message to khrushchev 
after spending the night of oct 26 1962 in the bomb shelter of the 
soviet embassy in havana so convinced was he that war was about to 
break out 
castro supposedly told khrushchev the invasion would come within 
48 hours 
the account from the soviet source was relayed by pierre 
salinger who was president kennedys press secretary at the time of 
the 1962 crisis it came from a weekend meeting in moscow of us 
soviet and cuban participants and scholars who have studied the 
worlds brush with nuclear war 26 years ago 
salinger would not identify the soviet official who was said to 
have imparted the information in a private conversation and the 
account was later denied by at least two soviets who took part in 
the conference 
among the revelations for americans attending the session was a 
soviet generals disclosure that 20 missiles and warheads which he 
said constituted onethird of his countrys nuclear arsenal at the 
time were on cuba at the time however he and another soviet 
official said the warheads had not been mounted on missile launchers 
and were not ready for firing 
an american source said however that he and other former us 
officials learned for the first time at the conference that the 
warheads not only were on the island but could have been mounted and 
fired within hours the source asked not to be identified 
the new york times today quoted unnamed americans as saying the 
report about castro requesting the nuclear strike originated with 
sergei khrushchev son of the former soviet premier it said sergei 
khrushchev subsequently denied making the comment 
the report also was denied by aleksandr i alekseyev soviet 
ambassador to cuba in 1962 
salinger in a telephone interview with the associated press and 
on abc news for which he is a special correspondent said the 
conference that brought together participants from all three sides 
for the first time showed the world was closer to nuclear war than 
we believed at that time 
other participants said the discussions also disclosed the soviet 
nuclear arsenal was smaller than american intelligence believed at 
the time and that there were four times more soviet troops in cuba 
than the kennedy administration thought 
a cuban official disclosed that 270000 soviet and cuban troops 
had been ready to go to war with the united states and that 100000 
casualties were expected former us defense secretary robert 
mcnamara said sunday 
at a news conference wrapping up the conference sunday he said 
the figures on cubas war readiness and casualty estimate were 
provided by jorge risquet a member of cubas ruling politburo 
mcnamara said that of the troops 40000 were soviet four times 
higher than us intelligence estimated at the time 
risquet cited the figures to show his country seriously believed 
that a us invasion of his island was imminent mcnamara said no 
such invasion was ever contemplated but speaking of the cubans he 
added if i had been in their shoes i would have believed the 
same thing 
american officials have said they were never sure whether any 
soviet nuclear warheads had actually reached cuba but that they 
assumed they had 
col gen dmitri a volkogonov director of the defense 
ministrys institute of military history said 20 soviet nuclear 
warheads were on cuba during the crisis and another 20 were headed 
there aboard a soviet ship that was caught in the us naval 
blockade 
volkogonov made the remarks in a closed session of the conference 
saturday and they were reported to the ap by raymond garthoff who 
was a state department official at the time of the crisis 
garthoff now a senior fellow at the brookings institution in 
washington said volkogonov reported 20 nuclear missiles were on 
soviet territory targeted at the united states 
the total stockpile of soviet nuclear warheads designed to fire 
on the united states at that time was 60 garthoff quoted volkogonov 
as saying 
volkogonov said the warheads in cuba were not ready for firing 
and viktor g komplektov a deputy soviet foreign minister said 
their presence on the island did not mean they would be put on 
launchers in preparation for attack 
at no time not before not during the beginning of the crisis 
or in the most acute moments of the crisis neither from the soviet 
command there in cuba nor in moscow was there or could there have 
been an order to mount nuclear warheads on the missiles he told 
reporters 
khrushchev eventually withdrew the missiles in exchange for 
president kennedys pledge not to invade cuba

a stripper performed explicit sexual acts for 
jimmy swaggart while he was involved with a prostitute penthouse 
magazine says but the television evangelists attorney called the 
story a fabrication 
catherine mary kampen said swaggart gained her trust as a 
spiritual adviser then emotionally manipulated her into acting out 
his sexual fantasies the magazine said in its march issue 
the whole things made up swaggart attorneys phillip a 
wittman said sunday 
wittman said swaggart would file a libel lawsuit probably this 
week against the mens magazine 
jimmy swaggart doesnt even know miss kampen said wittman 
hes never met her never seen her 
wittman said swaggart was returning home to baton rouge from a 
weekend crusade in atlanta 
according to penthouse swaggart approached kampen a homemaker 
and performer of striptease telegrams at a roadside telephone in 
july 1987 
kampen said swaggart told her he could help her with her marriage 
and personal life and promised to help her financially while 
demanding she perform sexual acts for him 
like debra murphree the prostitute whose account penthouse 
published in july kampen claimed that swaggart asked her to perform 
explicit sex acts while he watched 
murphree said swaggart wanted her 9yearold daughter to watch 
them have sex kampen said the evangelist asked to have sex with her 
13yearold daughter 
like murphree who said she was involved with swaggart from 
october 1986 until october 1987 kampen claimed she posed for 
swaggart but kept her daughter away from him 
unlike murphree who said she and swaggart attempted to have sex 
one time kampen told the magazine she and swaggart never had sex 
during their sixmonth relationship 
she said she asked him if he wanted to 
and he said oh sure but that would be cheating what were 
doing here is just playing its fun and games its not cheating 
you understand that dont you kampen quoted swaggart as saying 
wittmann said his law firm conducted its own investigation of the 
allegations after penthouse asked about them more than a month ago 
we advised penthouse that in our view the story was a 
fabrication and we were under the impression that they were not 
going to release the story he said 
they in fact had asked us for further information which we were 
in the process of assembing for them said wittmann adding that 
he was shocked the story had been published 
last february swaggart confessed that he had sinned against his 
church and his wife but never gave specifics 
murphree has said swaggart was talking about her but kampen said 
she thought swaggart was talking about her 
swaggart was defrocked by the assemblies of god in april because 
he disobeyed the pentecostal denominations order that he not preach 
for a year and returned to the pulpit three months later

he was just a convenient suspect attorney brooke wells said 
of client bernt murphy a 51yearold man with the mental capacity 
of an 8yearold 
third district judge pat brian is expected to rule by feb 6 on 
how much freedom murphy should be granted brian last week received 
recommendations from a committee appointed after junes order by the 
state supreme court to release murphy 
wells said murphy should fare well in a group home with other 
retarded adults but the man who supervised murphys treatment at 
utah state hospital in provo for the past seven years doesnt think 
hed be happy there 
personally i think it is cruel to send him away after this 
many years we have taken care of his needs cared about him and 
loved him it makes me a little sad to be required to kick him 
out said george brinkerhoff who also sat on the committee 
murphy was 19 when he was arrested in 1957 for questioning in the 
rape of a 5yearold salt lake city girl he subsequently confessed 
to the 1955 slaying of a 23yearold woman he met while both were 
students at a state training school for the retarded 
wells said there is little evidence linking murphy to the slaying 
of jocelyn hickenlooper and that had there been a trial before 
murphy was declared insane he most likely would have been cleared 
wells said notes from the 1957 investigation convinced her that 
police interrogators either suggested to murphy that he was involved 
in the hickenlooper killing or posed questions in such a way that 
the confused suspect just tried to satisfy them with his answers 
as a teenager murphy lived at the state training school an 
institution for the retarded in american fork about 35 miles south 
of salt lake city he was released in 1957 
there was no place in the state we could send him school 
director vernon houston said in 1957 utah has no institutions for 
such people all we can do is release them to society and they 
remain there until they commit a crime which sends them to the state 
prison 
in october 1957 salt lake city police chief w cleon skousen 
said murphy had confessed to hickenloopers slaying during routine 
questioning after the 5yearold rape victim identified him as her 
attacker 
skousen said murphy told officers he had hitchhiked from the 
school to hickenloopers salt lake city home the morning of june 11 
1955 and had asked her to go on a walk with him when she rejected 
his advances he killed her by choking her and hitting her with a 
rock the chief said 
the body was found two weeks later in a shallow grave 15 miles 
from the hickenlooper home 
until murphy confessed the crime had been unsolved and police 
were heavily criticized thenmayor earl glade said he was 
embarrassed by police fumbling 
third district judge stewart m hanson declared murphy insane 
later in 1957 and ordered him sent to the state hospital 
murphy was entitled to a yearly review but was repeatedly denied 
freedom or even a hearing 
in 1985 wells took the case to the states highest court 
the years have not been kind to murphy the attorney said a 
strapping 6footer in 1957 he now is a kind of a withered little 
person wells said 
brinkerhoff said he believes murphy is very much the same sort of 
person he was three decades ago and can be very caring and 
loving when there is a death in a family or a birthday at the 
hospital murphy alone among the residents always buys a card 
the committee was unable to predict the outcome of murphys 
release some members of the panel said 
the problem i foresee is him running away and coming back to 
us said brinkerhoff noting that murphy has no family or friends 
outside the hospital 
he has been told that being released is what he ought to want 
but it is very frightening for him said brinkerhoff some days 
bernt is excited to leave here and thinks he needs an apartment by 
himself but other days he just wants everyone to leave him alone

billie dawn lives 
the quintessential dumb broad of born yesterday has 
returned in triumph to broadway in a polished perceptive and almost 
perfect revival of garson kanins comedy of political corruption 
circa 1946 
kanins washington fable is nearly indestructible but it helps 
that billie one of the most endearing and enduring characters in 
modern american theater is played by madeline kahn miss kahn who 
hasnt been on broadway in more than 10 years is an inspired 
actress who also happens to be very funny 
her billie the uneducated exchorus girl who makes good is more 
than comic shes sexy intelligent and just a little bit shy you 
get a sense of the uncertainty underneath her street smarts still 
it is miss kahns bits of comic business that makes her so 
entrancing 
watch miss kahns entrance at the beginning of act 1 wrapped in 
white fur and clutching a valentine box of bonbons the actress 
teeters in on the highest of high heels the funny yet flirtatious 
walk is all showgirl a woman on display for the appreciation of any 
male who happens to be around 
or take a gander at the ferocious way she plays gin rummy 
forever rearranging her cards squeaking out the title song from 
anything goes and then gleefully announcing when she has 
trounced her opponent sublime 
kanins play which opened sunday at the 46th street theater is 
a combination of cinderella and pygmalion billie is the mistress of 
harry brock a selfmade millionaire junk dealer who has come to 
washington from new jersey to bribe senators and influence 
legislation 
brock a loutish man wants his girlfriend to learn couth so 
he hires a young idealistic magazine writer to educate her billie 
learns too well before long she is on to harrys unpatriotic 
schemes and able to turn the tables on the man who has kept her down 
so long 
ed asner in a difficult assignment blusters and bellows 
effectively as harry the unrepentant heavy in kanins mortality 
play hes a pinstriped villain unwillingly to believe that some 
people cant be bought harry is crude rude and more than a little 
violent when he slaps billie the audience gasps asner gets that 
meanness exactly right without having the play slip into melodrama 
daniel hugh kelly as billies crusading tutor makes a fine 
romantic foil for miss kahn hes not wimpy or overly intellectual 
just the kind of guy youd think billie eventually would fall for 
franklin cover as the junkmans boozy yet realistic lawyer 
delivers with gusto some of kanins most acerbic lines about the 
morality of washington officeholders john wylie is all smarmy 
venality as a corrupt senator while a popeyed peggy cosgrave as 
the senators priggish wife has a wonderful bit of comic business 
with asner on a couch 
as for born yesterday its apparent that the play is 
fortysomething those four decades show in its leisurely exposition 
its large cast 12 actors in 15 roles and particularly in its 
forthright idealism the comedy basks in the glow of confidence that 
arrived with the end of world war ii anything could be accomplished 
if you worked hard enough and really cared 
since then mccarthy watergate irangate pentagon scandals and 
other washington follies have frittered away the voters faith in 
elected public servants still director josephine abady who 
apparently had assistance from john tillinger during the later 
stages of the plays long tryout tour makes sure everything is 
played straight theres no condescension even when the actors are 
reciting dialogue that sounds like a lesson in civic responsibility 
the suitable single setting by designer david potts is an 
expensive washington hotel suite with the capitol dome just outside 
the window ann roth has garbed miss kahn in a variety of costumes 
with just the right amount of showbusiness gaudiness expensive 
glad rags an exchorus girl definitely would wear 
when born yesterday first opened on broadway more than 40 
years ago it starred paul douglas and an unknown comedian named 
judy holliday the play which ran for more than four years made 
miss holliday a star she also appeared in the excellent film 
version and won an oscar its that memory that miss kahn asner and 
others in this revival must compete with they are all up to the 
task 
in other reviews 
the daily news howard kissel wrote in our cynical era the 
plays uncomplicated idealism makes it even more moving what made 
born yesterday an instant hit of course was not its faith in the 
common man but its brilliant humor which the revival serves 
beautifully at times the pace slackens quibbles aside 
its great to have one of the best of american plays back on 
broadway 
clive barnes wrote in the new york post its comedy tonight 
both asner and miss kahn play the game as if it were a hand of 
gin rummy and both of them very well know the deal they are 
delicious 
but frank rich of the new york times wrote the required 
freshness is entirely absent from the elephantine current 
production which arriving in new york after an extended road tour 
lumbers about the stage like a dusty old packard in search of a 
100000mile overhaul

jurors say physical evidence was lacking 
in the murder and conspiracy case against chicago millionaire noah 
robinson who was convicted as an accessory in the stabbing of a 
gangland murder witness 
robinson the halfbrother of the rev jesse jackson received 
the maximum sentence of 10 years in prison following saturdays 
conviction of accessory after the fact of a felony 
state circuit judge james e moore declared a mistrial on the 
other charges against the 45yearold greenville native murder 
conspiracy to commit murder criminal conspiracy and accessory 
before the fact of assault and battery with intent to kill 
solicitor joe watson said robinson would be retried on those 
charges 
defense attorneys said they would appeal an appeal bond of 
100000 was set and moore reinstated bond of 100000 on the other 
charges 
the murder and murder conspiracy charges stemmed from the 1986 
shooting death here of childhood friend and former employee leroy 
hambone barber the criminal conspiracy and accessory charge 
resulted from the 1987 stabbing of janice denise rosemond who 
witnessed barbers slaying by reputed chicago gang members ms 
rosemond survived 
jurors who deliberated for 16 hours over three days said after 
the trial that the rosemond portion of the case was bolstered by 
physical evidence but the barber portion was not 
they said panel members leaned against convicting robinson of 
murder and conspiracy because some didnt believe prosecution 
testimony by former members of the el rukns a powerful chicago 
gang three former gang members charged with murder in barbers 
death testified on condition the prosecution not seek the death 
penalty against them 
i just was expecting a whole lot more evidence said monica 
burrell who voted to acquit robinson of the barber charges 
basically what they had was a bunch of testimony from gang 
members and i just found it hard to base my opinion on that 
a juror who spoke on condition of anonymity told the greenville 
news the panel convicted robinson on the accessory charge because of 
physical evidence that the businessmans associate holandus jake 
oliver wired money to relatives of freddie sweeney who was charged 
with assault and battery with intent to kill ms rosemond 
sweeney a former employee of robinson testified that robinson 
offered him 5000 to kill ms rosemond because she reportedly 
testified about barbers murder before a grand jury in chicago 
watson placed into evidence copies of money orders wired from 
robinson to sweeney after sweeney allegedly attacked ms rosemond 
robinson whose business interests include a construction 
company has maintained that he is a victim of a political 
conspiracy caused partly by jacksons success

pope john paul ii today warned against 
excessive use of lay people in priestly functions and said the 
vatican is studying the entire question of nonordained ministries 
in a 196page document on the role of the laity in church and 
society the pope also urged women to play a greater role in the 
church though not as priests and said the vatican was tightening 
control over lay movements and organizations 
the 42000word document entitled the lay members of christs 
faithful people is the pontiffs response to issues raised by 
roman catholic bishops from around the world at the 1987 synod on 
the laity at the vatican 
the synod which convenes every few years to advise the pope on 
various issues facing the church was dominated by the womens issue 
and the question of nonordained ministries these include lector 
acolyte and altar server people who assist during mass 
during the synod us bishops made proposals to open up 
nonordained ministries to women others especially african 
bishops opposed the idea 
under church law women are barred from those functions but in 
the united states and some other countries women and girls 
sometimes fill those roles informally without installation 
in his document the pope disclosed that a commission had been 
formed to study the entire question of lay ministries until the 
commission completes its work he urged local churches not to act on 
their own saying they should faithfully respect the current 
regulations 
the pope said the distinction between clergy and laity is 
sometimes blurred leading bishops to criticize the 
tooindiscriminate use of the word ministrythe lack of 
observance of ecclesiastical laws and normsand the tendency 
towards a clericalization of the lay faithful 
he said there have been abuses of the church law allowing laymen 
to carry out certain functions in situations of emergency and 
chronic necessity such as lack of priests or deacons these 
functions include presiding over liturgical prayers conferring 
baptism and distributing communion 
the pope said pastors should exercise maximum care in 
assigning these roles to lay people 
a senior vatican official said the pope appeared to be firing 
warning shots indicating there could be more controls over 
nonordained ministries rather than a decision to open them to women 
hes certainly not saying hold on girls your time is 
coming said the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the statements tend more toward a restrictive presence of lay 
people in ministries 
the pope devoted 17 pages to the role of women but broke no new 
ground in his position most recently set out in his document on 
the dignity of women issued in september 
he condemned all discrimination against women but reaffirmed that 
they cannot be ordained as priests 
the pope praised the decisive role that women have played 
throughout the history of the church adding it is necessary that 
this history continue indeed that it be expanded and 
intensified 
john paul said women can play a greater role in decisionmaking 
noting that church law allows them to serve on various dioceselevel 
councils at the same time he noted that some bishops had expressed 
concern that focusing on women would neglect the role of men 
in reality various sectors in the church must lament the 
absence or the scarcity of the presence of men some of whom 
abdicate their proper church responsibilities allowing them to be 
fulfilled only by women the document says 
the pope also addressed the bishops concerns about lay 
movements which have become more vocal in recent years especially 
in europe and latin america 
the pope said there is a need for clear and definite criteria 
for discerning and recognizing such lay groups including 
guidelines calling for strong and authentic communion with the 
pope and conformity to church teaching 
he said the vatican is preparing a list of officially approved 
associations 
the document touched on many of the popes familiar themes 
urging lay people to work for peace justice human rights and 
religious freedom and to combat secularism atheism and abortion

a us supreme court ruling that struck down 
an ordinance mandating city contracts for minority companies could 
boost unemployment and violent crime here a black business leader 
says 
the supreme court last monday ruled that the ordinance which 
requires that 30 percent of the value of all city contracts be set 
aside for minority companies unconstitutionally discriminated 
against whites 
the ruling is going to ruin quite a few businesses and it is 
devestating to the economic fiber of the black community said 
gladys jacksonweston executive director of the metropolitan 
business league the leading black business association in the 
virginia capital 
there will be an increase in unemployment and welfare the 
murder rate in the city is now tied to economics and folks who have 
lost their dreams and well have more people out there who have 
lost their dreams ms jacksonweston said recently 
there are nearly 1000 minorityrun contractors and related 
businesses in the metropolitan area ms jacksonweston said she 
said she believes onethird of that number wont survive without the 
ordinance 
she said her group would step up training of minority contractors 
on keeping books using computers and reducing overhead 
former mayor henry l marsh iii who was instrumental in pushing 
the ordinance through in 1983 believes the ruling will prolong 
discrimination in the traditionally whitedominated construction 
industry 
its a big blow marsh said discrimination against 
minority constructors is a serious problem in richmond as in other 
communities 
marsh now a city councilman and other city officials point to 
statistics as proof the ordinance was needed 
richmonds population of 632015 is 52 percent minorities 
according to city manager robert c bobb before the ordinance took 
effect less than 1 percent of the citys construction work was 
awardedm to minority companies bobb said 
while the ordinance was in effect minority companies were 
awarded about 40 percent of the citys work since its suspension in 
july 1987 the percentage has dropped back below 2 percent bobb 
said 
there has been little or no progress he said i find that 
very discouraging without the program in place were furthering a 
very closed system firms that are historically locked out will 
continue to be locked out 
obviously people wanted to do the work marsh said they 
did it when the ordinance was in effect there were no complaints 
that the work was not done well or that there was an inordinate 
expense 
at least one minority contractor believes the ruling will ruin 
his business which employs nine people 
i was expecting it to go the other way said merlin hargrove 
of united unlimited construction co i guess the only thing you 
can do is pray 
marsh said city council members are discussing possible 
affirmative action programs that would conform with the high courts 
ruling 
john payton a washington attorney who represented richmond 
before the supreme court said the city would have to comply with 
the courts order that it make detailed findings of specific 
discrimination before implementing a program that includes any kind 
of racial preference 
you have to make rigorous findings of discrimination he 
said we thought we showed it but the court said the numbers 
dont matter you have to find actual evidence 
payton said he thought the city would be able to prove actual 
discrimination to meet the courts standards

a young woman whose battered body was found 
floating in the pacific off channel island harbor probably was 
killed by a shark authorities said 
the body of the unidentified woman 18 to 26 years old was spotted 
saturday by the crew of a sailboat six miles from the island 
she apparently had been dead one to two days said dr f warren 
lovell ventura county coroner 
a 13inch piece of flesh was missing from the womans left thigh 
said lovell who described the wound as a classic shark bite 
there were a number of other shark bites there was a fresh 
bruise on the back of her right hand he said sunday 
lovell said the bruise appeared to have been caused when the 
woman tried to fight off the attacking shark in the ocean 50 miles 
northwest of los angeles 
lovell said her lungs did not show the classic findings 
associated with drowning but the bites apparently occurred before 
the woman died 
authorities said the woman may have been windsurfing as southern 
california was having warm and sunny weather 
a check of law enforcement agencies showed no missing person 
report who matched the womans description said lovell 
the last fatal shark attack off california was in september 1984 
when an abalone diver was mauled 40 miles south of san francisco 
john mccosker a shark expert and director of the steinhart 
aquarium in san francisco said the latest attack may have been by a 
great white shark which have been known to exceed 20 feet and 3 
tons 
if this was in fact a great white attack it would be the first 
that we know of to have occurred south of santa barbara mccosker 
said

officials in boston and atlanta fear some affirmative action 
programs may be jeopardized by the us supreme courts ruling 
against a racial quota system for government contracts but leaders 
elsewhere hope slightly different plans will survive 
in a 63 vote last monday the supreme court struck down a 
program in richmond va that required whiteowned companies 
bidding on any city contract to set aside 30 percent of the 
contracts value for minorityowned subcontractors 
the high court said rigid racial quotas must be supported by 
evidence for example that blackowned enterprises tried to obtain 
construction contracts but were denied them without such evidence 
the use of racial quotas violates the equalprotection rights of 
whites 
but many state affirmative action programs across the nation are 
voluntary or have goals to aim for rather than mandatory targets for 
minority participation in government contracts or they were 
instituted on the basis of evidence said a sampling of officials 
contacted by the associated press 
before richmonds quota went into effect less than 1 percent of 
the citys construction work was awarded to minority firms 
according to city manager robert c bobb richmond is 52 percent 
minority 
during the life of the ordinance minority firms were awarded 
about 40 percent of the citys work since the laws suspension in 
july 1987 the percentage has dropped back below 2 percent bobb 
said 
the georgia supreme court is considering a challenge to atlantas 
35 percent minority business enterprise program and officials of the 
blackmajority city fear the state court might take its cue from the 
ruling in the richmond case 
the atlanta program has almost exactly the same defects that 
richmonds has said william o miller president of the 
southeastern legal foundation a conservative group challenging 
atlantas program 
last year atlanta awarded 249 million in jobs to minorityowned 
businesses 367 percent of all of its contracts more than 300 
million in city business has gone to minority contractors since the 
35 percent minority participation goal was set in 1975 
boston mayor raymond l flynn said he feared the ruling could 
jeopardize some of his citys affirmative action programs in 
development hiring and contracts 
an ordinance adopted in december 1987 required boston to award 15 
percent of all its contracts to businesses owned by minorities and 5 
percent to businesses owned by women 
bostons population is about 35 percent minority minorities and 
women received 27 million in city contracts in fiscal 1988 about 
14 percent of the total eligible dollars said sheila hubbard 
director of the mayors minority and women business office that 
compares with 152 million in fiscal 1985 
michigan authorities however are confident the us supreme 
court will uphold their law which requires 7 percent of all 
purchasing and construction grants to go to minorityowned 
businesses and 5 percent to go to businesses owned by women 
state officials say they believe enough evidence about 
discrimination was presented before the law took effect it took 
10 years of bill introductions and hearings to get it through the 
legislature said john roy castillo executive director of the 
state civil rights commission 
a california program which took effect this month should survive 
an expected challenge because it sets a goal of 15 percent for 
minority participation in state business and a 5 percent goal for 
womenowned companies not an absolute quota said state 
assemblywoman maxine waters the bills sponsor 
however attorney john findley of the pacific legal foundation 
said minority contracting plans in california have one thing in 
common with the richmond measure theres no showing of past 
discrimination and a program designed specifically to remedy it 
according to the state department of finances population 
research unit californias 278 million population is 24 percent 
hispanic 7 percent black and 9 percent asian and others about 51

security has been tightened for the trial of 
richard ramirez the drifter accused of 1 satanic slayings in the 
night stalker serial murder case that terrorized california four 
years ago 
deputy district attorney philip halpin was scheduled to give the 
prosecutions opening statement today six months after jury 
selection began 
superior court judge michael tynan told the 12member jury to 
anticipate two years of testimony 
when the courtroom opens spectators will have to pass through 
metal detectors similar to the devices used in airports ramirez 
will be restrained by leg shackles while seated in court 
halpin requested extra security measures last august when the 
sheriffs department informed him ramirez had allegedly threatened 
to kill him in court with a smuggled gun and then turn it on 
spectators 
ramirez 28 a pale shaggyhaired drifter from el paso texas 
who was arrested after an angry mob chased him down is charged with 
13 counts of murder and 30 other felonies including rape robbery 
and attempted murder stemming from the 1985 crime spree he could 
receive the death penalty if convicted 
his trial was recently delayed by a controversy over the racial 
makeup of the jury the defense had accused prosecutors of 
systematically excluding hispanics and black women while the 
prosecution had accused the defense of excluding whites and asians 
from the jury six hispanics and six blacks were impaneled 
the unpredictable ramirez once yelled hail satan in court 
and flashed an inverted pentagram a fivepoint star often 
associated with devil worship on his palm he has been more subdued 
recently and taken to wearing black clothing and sunglasses that he 
uses to peer at the crowd 
the charges stem from a 1985 summer crime spree in which a 
nocturnal killer entered homes through unlocked windows or doors 
raped women killed both men and women with executionstyle gunshot 
blasts to the head and stole jewelry and other valuables 
the killer was dubbed the night stalker by the press and fear 
swept the city then throughout the state as the crimes spread north 
to san francisco and south to orange county where ramirez also is 
charged 
the crimes were especially gruesome one of the victims eyes was 
gouged out and several females victims testified the killer made 
them swear to satan as they were being sexually assaulted 
ramirez was arrested after he was chased and beaten by an angry 
east los angeles mob during the 1985 labor day weekend his picture 
had just appeared in newspapers as the prime suspect in the night 
stalker crime spree

in an office set in central new jerseys 
farmland researchers are drawing blueprints for space communities 
built from moon rock and powered by huge solar satellites 
it may sound like science fiction but gregg maryniak says such 
dreams could become reality at the start of the next century 
were trying to change from thinking of space as a void to 
thinking of it as a font of energy and material resources that makes 
it a good place for people says maryniak executive vice 
president of the space studies institute 
maryniak and gerard k oneill a nuclear physicist and professor 
emeritus at princeton university who founded the institute in 1977 
are among those driven by the belief that man is rapidly consuming 
the earths natural resources and making it uninhabitable with 
pollution and garbage 
they believe new energy sources could be developed in space 
i see this kind of activity as one of the few bright rays of 
hope in a situation that otherwise appears to be hopeless 
maryniak said in an interview at the institute which is housed at a 
former rocket engine plant 
since its too expensive to carry materials into space 
scientists must develop construction materials that are already 
available there he said the closest source is the moon 
the private nonprofit institute already has developed three 
prototypes of a mass driver a machine used to launch 
baseballsize fragments of mined moon rock to a central collection 
place in space maryniak describes the collection spot as a 
celestial catchers mitt 
he says moon rock composed mainly of oxygen silicon and metals 
can be broken into building materials and fuel using solar energy 
the latest mass driver is a tube 1feet wide and 500 feet long 
that propels material into space at a rate of 1 miles per second 
the moon rock could be used to build solar power satellites that 
would collect sunlight convert it to electricity and beam it to 
earth 
such satellites up to 5 miles long and 1 miles wide could 
produce as much electricity as three or four nuclear reactors and 
provide all the energy needs of a city the size of new york or 
chicago maryniak says 
totally selfsufficient space cities could be built with 
agricultural areas controlled atmosphere water supplies and 
gravitational field such cities would house tens of thousands of 
people and have trees rivers and birds 
ivan bekey special assistant at the national aeronautics and 
space administrations office of exploration in washington said the 
institutes projects are possible but probably wont be reality for 
20 to 40 years 
maryniak said people will choose to live in space because of the 
clean environment greater security and the possibility of 
customizing cities to fit specific needs 
at first they are going to be in places where the 
inhabitants are real pioneers he said the second generation of 
people will think its very normal and wont be particularly 
interested in going back to see old mother earth 
maryniak said the first step probably will be much smaller and 
could come in three years plans are under way to send a prospecting 
capsule to the moon to determine whether there is ice at the poles 
finding water would be a major breakthrough because its needed for 
life and rocket fuel 
oneill worked with nasa in the mid1970s to study the 
feasibility of space colonies maryniak said the space agency also 
considered solar generators during the arab oil embargo but 
abandoned them as too costly 
maryniak said a solar generator can be built from moon rock at a 
fraction of the cost of building one with materials shipped from 
earth 
in december maryniak traveled to the soviet union and signed an 
agreement with the moscow aviation institute the countrys leading 
aerospace training institution to perform joint research on the 
effects of gravity energy transmission and a lunar probe

a former nazi ss soldier has shocked west germans 
by leading a tiny rightwing extremist party to a strong showing in 
west berlin state elections on a platform of ridding the city of 
foreigners 
sundays vote also will send two members of the republican party 
to the federal parliament next year the first time that the extreme 
right will be represented in bonn since 1953 
kick out the nazis foreigners stay several thousand people 
chanted as they marched through west berlin late sunday to protest 
the republican partys success 
in the balloting chancellor helmut kohls governing christian 
democrats lost their majority in west berlins legislature and said 
they now plan to form a governing coalition with the leftofcenter 
social democrats kohl told the ard television network that he was 
alarmed by the showing of the republicans 
the 5yearold republican party captured 11 seats in sundays 
voting for the 138member west berlin state legislature west berlin 
is considered a state under the west german system but its 
representatives in the national parliament have limited powers 
former nazi ss soldier franz schoenhuber the republican leader 
had led a campaign to oust turks and other foreign workers from west 
berlin foreigners make up about 10 percent of the citys population 
of 2 million 
west germans often have expressed concern about the growing 
number of foreigners in their country but sundays vote provided 
the most dramatic example in years of a major election success for a 
party with strong opposition to foreigners 
it was the first state election in west germany since the october 
death of governor franz josef strauss of bavaria the 
archconservative who is credited with keeping smaller rightwing 
extremists groups in check many people had predicted his death 
would create the possibility for the smaller rightist groups to have 
a shot at success 
schoenhuber 66 told rallies during the election campaign that 
the christian democrats were drifting further and further to the 
left 
the republicans won 75 percent of the vote on sunday according 
to nearly complete official returns the christian democrats won 38 
percent of the vote and 55 seats losing 12 seats from the last 
election four years ago 
christian democratic mayor eberhard diepgens coalition partners 
the free democrats lost all 12 of their seats by failing to muster 
the 5 percent of the vote necessary for representation 
the social democrats won 37 percent of the vote for 55 seats and 
the leftwing alternative list party won 17 seats with a 12 percent 
showing a gain of two seats 
diepgen said the republicans successful bid to enter the 
legislature should not be allowed to cast the city and its 
residents in a false light 
west german news media reacted with shock to the results in west 
berlin 
the frankfurtbased hesse state radio broadcast a special report 
today that which concluded that while the republican party showed 
farrightist tendencies it was far from the nazi party that gained 
hold in germany in the 1920s 
the republican party was formed in 1983 and its previous best 
success was a 3 percent share of the votes in 1986 state elections 
in traditionally conservative bavaria 
sundays surprise success will send two republican party members 
to the federal parliament after national elections next year west 
berlins 22member delegation in the federal parliament can vote in 
committee but has very limited voting rights in full sessions 
they will be the first rightwing extremists in the bonn assembly 
since 1953 the german reich party had five members during the first 
west german legislature starting in 1949 
just under 80 percent of west berlins voters cast ballots on 
sunday according to television forecasts compared with 836 
percent in 1985 
west berlin is a separate state of west germany surrounded by 
east german territory it was formed from western zones of berlin 
occupied by the allied forces in world war ii

following are excerpts from pope john paul 
iis document on the laity from the official englishlanguage text 
provided by the vatican 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on the role of laity in the world today 
a new state of affairs today both in the church and in social 
economic political and cultural life calls with particular urgency 
for the action of the lay faithful if lack of commitment is always 
unacceptable the present time renders it even more so it is not 
permissible for anyone to remain idle 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on lay participation in priestly roles 
when necessity and expediency in the church require it the 
pastors according to established norms from universal law can 
entrust to the lay faithful certain offices and roles that are 
connected to their pastoral ministry but do not require the 
character of orders 
however the exercise of such tasks does not make pastors of the 
lay faithful in fact a person is not a minister simply in 
performing a task but through sacramental ordination 
in the same synod assembly a critical judgment was voiced 
about a too indiscriminate use of the word ministry the 
confusion and the equating of the common priesthood and the 
ministerial priesthood the lack of observance of ecclesiastical 
laws and norms the arbitrary interpretation of the concept of 
supply the tendency towards a clericalization of the lay 
faithful and the risk of creating in reality an ecclesial 
structure of parallel service to that founded on the sacrament of 
orders 
in the first place then it is necessary that in acknowledging 
and in conferring various ministries offices and roles on the lay 
faithful the pastors exercise the maximum care to institute them on 
the basis of baptism in which these tasks are rooted it is also 
necessary that pastors guard against facile yet abusive recourse to 
a presumed situation of emergency or to supply by necessity 
where objectively this does not exist or where alternative 
possibilities could exist through better pastoral planning 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on lectors and acolytes 
a commission was established to respond to this desire voiced 
by the synod fathers specifically to provide an indepth study of 
the various theological liturgical juridicial and pastoral 
considerations which are associated with the great increase today of 
the ministries entrusted to the lay faithful 
while the conclusions of the commissions study are awaited a 
more ordered and fruitful ecclesial practice of the ministries 
entrusted to the lay faithful can be achieved if all the particular 
churches faithfully respect the above mentioned theological 
principles especially the essential difference between the 
ministerial priesthood and the common priesthood and difference 
between the ministries derived from the sacrament of orders and 
those derived from the sacraments of baptism and confirmation 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on lay movements 
it is exceedingly opportune that some new associations and 
movements receive official recognition and explicit approval from 
competent church authority to facilitate their growth on both the 
national and international level 
the pontifical council for the laity has the task of preparing a 
list of those associations which have received the official approval 
of the holy see and at the same time of drawing up together with 
the ponitifical council for the union of christians the basic 
conditions on which this approval might be given to ecumenical 
associations in which there is a majority of catholics and 
determining those cases in which such an approval is not possible 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on women 
in her participation in the life and mission of the church a 
woman cannot receive the sacrament of orders and therefore cannot 
fulfill the proper function of the ministerial priesthood this is a 
practice that the church has always found in the expressed will of 
christ totally free and sovereign who called only men to be his 
apostles 
above all the acknowledgment in theory of the active and 
responsible presence of woman in the church must be realized in 
practice with this in mind this exhortation addressed to the lay 
faithful with its deliberate and repeated use of the terms women 
and men must be read furthermore the revised code of canon law 
contains many provisions on the participation of women in the life 
and mission of the church they are provisions that must be more 
commonly known and according to the diverse sensibilities of 
culture and opportuneness in a pastoral situation be realized with 
greater timeliness and determination 
an example comes to mind in the participation of women on 
diocesan and parochial pastoral councils as well as diocesan synods 
and particular councils

the panchen lama the paradoxical figure many 
tibetans revered as a religious leader but despised for cooperating 
with the chinese has died in his homeland he was 50 
tibetan buddhisms second ranking religious leader died saturday 
of a heart attack in xigaze chinas official xinhua news agency 
reported 
at the time of his death the 10th panchen lama was vice chairman 
of the national peoples congress chinas parliament and honorary 
president of the chinese buddhists association 
he lived in beijing but had traveled to xigaze to officiate at 
the opening of a rebuilt great stupa the shrine that contains 
remains of the fifth to ninth panchen lamas 
it had been destroyed and the remains defiled during the 196676 
cultural revolution when chinese leftists destroyed temples and 
persecuted many religious tibetans 
unlike his superior the dalai lama who fled into exile after a 
1959 uprising against the chinese the panchen lama stayed and 
backed the chinese but he refused to denounce his selfexiled 
spiritual mentor and was caught in a dilemma of being trusted by 
neither side 
he also presented a dilemma to tibetans especially after he 
became chinas chief tibetan spokesman for sinotibetan unity and 
denied charges by tibetan exiles that their people continue to be 
arrested and persecuted for voicing opposition to chinese rule 
although he has been a collaborator with the chinese we 
consider him a true tibetan because he had no choice said a 
refugee in dharmsala the indian homeinexile to the dalai lama and 
some of the 100000 tibetans who fled with him 
on sunday exiles walked the streets of the city in a tearyeyed 
daze and shopkeepers lowered their shutters in honor of the dead man 
despite his support for the communists the chinese jailed the 
panchen lama for 20 months during the cultural revolution and kept 
him under house arrest for nine years he was allowed to return to 
tibet only in 1982 
in the past several years however he began openly discussing 
the sufferings of tibetans since the communist army occupied the 
sparsely populated mountain area in 1950 
one of his strongest statements came last week on wednesday two 
official chinese dailies quoted him as saying tibetans have paid too 
high a price for their development under the chinese 
he said chinese communists mistakes were greater than their 
successes in tibet some officials had completely forgotten the 
tragedy of the cultural revolution and others had even begun to 
repeat the mistakes he said 
the panchen lama also echoed the position of the dalai lama in 
calling for more autonomy for tibetans 
the dalai lama has been recognized from the 15th century as the 
spiritual and temporal ruler of tibet which remained a theocracy 
until 1950 the panchen lama traditionally held the powerful post of 
chief abbot of the tashi lump monastery near xigaze tibets second 
largest city 
kesang tseten was born in february 1938 in qinghai the province 
northeast of tibet which also has a large tibetan population at age 
3 he was named by tibetan religious leaders as one of three 
candidates considered possible reincarnates of the ninth panchen 
lama who died in 1937 
after several years of wrangling and championed by the chinese 
communists kesang was approved as the 10th panchen lama on june 3 
1949 
it could take several years to determine the 11th panchen lama

us diplomats lowered the stars and 
stripes and closed their mission in embattled kabul today as 
departing soviet troops headed north in what one moscow envoy said 
could be the last truck convoy home 
afghan troops and moslem guerrillas continue to fight for control 
of the salang highway the only road linking the capital and the 
soviet border 
insurgents based in pakistan said sunday that soviet bombing and 
missile attacks along the 260mile highway had killed 600 civilians 
and injured 1200 in the past several days 
the mangled bodies are still under the debris the afghan 
news agency operated from bordering pakistan by a guerrilla group 
said in a telexed statement 
official radio kabul monitored in pakistan said afghan troops 
had carried out successful military operations with civilians 
who want to keep the rugged salang highway open 
later in the day a car bomb and a truck bomb injured several 
people in the capital a foreign ministry spokesman said on 
condition of anonymity 
not many people were injured he said but declined to give 
the exact number or say exactly where the explosions occurred 
just north of kabul on sunday a convoy of soviet soldiers in 
armored personnel carriers and trucks loaded with missile launchers 
cruised through a soviet bunker checkpoint as helicopter gunships 
hovered nearby offering cover 
a soviet diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said 
this could be the last convoy he refused to elaborate 
two fighter jets streaked overhead and disappeared behind the 
snowcovered mountains just beyond the hills surrounding kabul 
the remaining red army troops apparently are leaving on transport 
planes completing a withdrawal begun eight months ago under a 
unbrokered agreement to end the soviets nineyear intervention 
in afghanistan 
moscow sent about 115000 troops into afghanistan in december 
1979 to prop up marxists who seized power in a coup the previous 
year 
soviet diplomats in kabul say the remaining 15000 to 20000 red 
army troops could be gone by the end of the week about 10 days 
before the un deadline of feb 15 
the guerrillas are not a party to the un agreement and have 
vowed to overthrow the government of president najib once the 
soviets are gone 
at the us embassy in kabul american diplomats said they would 
return once peace is restored in this wartorn counry 
today we leave at a moment that is both happy and sad said 
the charge daffaires jon d glassman after a flaglowering 
ceremony in the embassys snowcovered compound 
we are pleased that the people of afghanistan are going to be 
relieved of their suffering but we know their struggle is not over 
the people of the united states are with them he said we will 
be back as soon as the conflict is over 
at the ceremony three marine guards took down the us flag 
folded it and handed it to glassman 
the state department last week ordered the 11member embassy 
staff to leave citing fears the afghan army may not be capable of 
protecting foreign diplomats once the soviets leave 
west germany britain japan france and austria all have 
withdrawn or are withdrawing their embassy staffs italy and some of 
moscows east bloc allies are considering similar action 
glassman declned to say when the us staff would leave kabul 
aboard a chartered flight to india the airport was closed today due 
to snow and fog 
after the embassy staff departs 10 americans will remain in 
kabul all are missonaries 
the afghan government has denounced the embassy closures as 
unnecessary and aimed solely at encouraging the usbacked moslem 
insurgents to intensify their fighting 
at a soviet checkpoint about 12 miles north of kabul on sunday 
afghan soldiers paced nervously along the salang highway as the 
soviet convoy rolled past 
hows everything going one afghan officer was asked 
very bad he said 
earlier sunday afghan soldiers said guerrillas had fired on a 
convoy of about 350 trucks carrying flour eggs diesel fuel 
gasoline and other supplies down the highway to kabul one driver 
an afghan was slightly injured by a bullet that grazed his leg 
they said 
the soviets have assured the najib government that they will 
continue to provide military assistance after the last soviet troops 
return home 
tass said sunday that a soviet delegation led by yuri maslyukov 
a nonvoting member of the ruling politburo had arrived in kabul 
for talks with najib on soviet economic aid 
it said the discussion focused on how moscow would help the 
afghans thwart the oppositions plans to establish an economic 
blockade of the capital and that moscow would supply food fuel 
and essentials

officials trying to bail out the fund that 
insures deposits in federal savings and loan institutions should go 
after executives of those institutions who contributed to the 
problem and get rid of unsound institutions the chairman of a 
senate banking subcommittee said today 
we ought to be seeing to it that those people who are driving 
around in jaguars and have big yachts and belong to fancy country 
clubs come up to the bar now and pay up sen alan dixon dill 
said on cbs this morning 
there are a lot of people that were executives of thrifts 
around the country that are personally liable and we ought to be 
getting after them said dixon who heads the banking subcommittee 
on consumer and regulatory affairs 
we ought to invoke safety and soundness rules against states 
that are liberalizing investment laws for thrifts and endangering 
the security of those institutions he continued 
and we ought to be putting some money into the fslic federal 
savings and loan insurance corp fund and reducing the number of 
thrifts in the country getting rid of the bad ones and supporting 
the good ones 
asked if there was any chance congress would approve a proposal 
floated by the bush administration to charge depositors at banks and 
sampls a fee of 30 cents per 100 deposited to help pay for insurance 
dixon said none whatsoever 
i havent heard of anybody that likes the idea and i think that 
idea is born dead he said 
white house chief of staff john sununu said sunday that the 
proposal remains a live option despite widespread congressional and 
industry opposition he also said on abcs this week with david 
brinkley that there are a variety of options being examined 
noting that financial institutions have long paid a fee for 
federal deposit insurance sununu said the plan under study was 
simply a matter of taking the current fee and adjusting it to 
affect the reality 
if financial institutions were to pass along such an increased 
fee directly to depositors american savers still would be getting a 
bargain for having their savings insured by their government he 
said 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee said on the same program that trial balloon of putting 
a tax on deposits was really very foolish

the depot operated by the us air force 303rd tactical missile 
wing had been one of two in britain for storing american cruise 
missiles the last of the bases 16 operational missiles and two 
spares were removed in november 
they were among the 2700 soviet and us landbased nuclear 
missiles with ranges of 300 to 3000 miles to be scrapped by 1991 
under terms of the nations arms control treaty

first operational cruise missile unit to be inactivated said maj 
gen marcus anderson commander of the 3rd air force 
however he said there is always a little sadness in seeing a 
unit deactivated a unit takes on an identity and a pride in doing 
its job anderson said 
the 600acre site at royal air force base molesworth in 
cambridgshire 50 miles north of london was designated as a depot 
in 1980 along with greenham common in berkshire 50 miles west of 
london 
the depots were designated for the storage of 160 american cruise 
missiles but molesworth never reached its full complement of 64 it 
will remain a us base although officials have not yet said how it 
will be used 
the defense ministry said the greenham common depot will close 
later the 96 missiles there are to be removed sometime this year 
the cruise missiles began leaving england sept 8 less than a 
year after they arrived at molesworth all were flown to davis 
monthan base in tucson ariz to be destroyed under the watch of 
soviet inspectors 
the warheads do not have to be destroyed under the treaty and 
us officials said they eventually will be returned to the united 
states 
the arms control agreement was signed by thenpresident ronald 
reagan and soviet president mikhail gorbachev in december 1987 and 
ratified by the us senate in june 1988 
the soviets began removing some of their ss20 missiles targeted 
at western europe in february 1988 the first american missiles 
nine pershing 2s were removed sept 1 from a base in west germany 
the first cruise missiles arrived in europe in november 1983 and 
were deployed at greenham common the molesworth missiles were the 
last to be deployed shortly before the arms control treaty was 
signed

the communist central committee today 
rejected demands to debate the resignation of party leader stipe 
suvar who then went on the attack against hardline policies 
associated with his main rival 
opening a meeting called to discuss the resignation demands and a 
possible shakeup in the ruling elite suvar criticized his chief 
political rival serbian communist leader slobodan milosevic 
without mentioning him by name 
socialist political pluralism or neostalinism those are the 
two alternatives offered by different factions within the party 
leadership as the way out of yugoslavias economic and political 
crisis the national party chief said 
the meeting of the policysetting body is shaping up as a 
showdown between party liberals and the hardline coalition led by 
milosevic the party chief in the largest of yugoslavias six 
republics 
suvar today launched a scathing attack on what he called 
dogmatic policies generally attributed to the serbian leader 
milosevics supporters suffered an initial setback at todays 
meeting in a show of hands participants overwhelmingly rejected a 
serbian proposal to discuss demands for suvars resignation 
in the speech that followed suvar called for more political 
pluralism which is conditional on the competition of ideas he 
contrasted that with the dictatorship of the communist party 
which would use bureaucratic methods to run the country 
suvar and several nonserbian politburo members have recently 
come under fire from milosevic supporters for what they call 
antiserbian policies and for denouncing growing nationalism in the 
republic 
milosevics supporters spearheaded a wave of nationalist serbian 
protests last year that forced resignations of party leaders in 
several areas around the country in addition to calling for party 
and economic reform the protesters demanded more serbian control in 
kosovo province where they say slavs are threatened by an ethnic 
albanian majority 
suvar said growing nationalism creates worries for the survival 
of yugoslavia 
the late president tito created the federal system that balances 
the competing ethnic groups in a loose federation of six republics 
and two nominally autonomous provinces 
in todays speech the party president painted the attack on him 
and other ruling politburo members as a clash between different 
political and economic concepts of yugoslavias future development 
the battle represents a fundamental dispute between reformist 
and antireformist forces within the party suvar said 
he is supported by the liberal northern republics of slovenia and 
croatia which favor increased political pluralism more democracy 
and radical marketoriented reforms 
yugoslavias woes include a 250 percent inflation rate and a 
sharp drop in living standards in addition to an alarming increase 
in labor and ethnic unrest 
milosevic who has called for more centralized party control over 
the countrys affairs draws his support from yugoslavias poorer 
southern regions 
they fear that marketoriented reforms would end state subsidies 
for sometimes unprofitable industries and lead to many layoffs and 
more unrest 
in a clear reference to the policies of serbia and milosevic 
suvar said such people pay lip service to open markets and the 
restructuring of yugoslavias economy while supporting obsolete 
industrial plants and subsidizing giant unprofitable factories

an unmanned soviet research probe is orbiting mars 
on a research mission to learn more about the planets climate and 
soil the official news agency tass reported 
phobos ii went into orbit sunday after a sixmonth 
111millionmile voyage from earth tass said 
the spacecraft is carrying instruments and experiments prepared 
by 12 countries and the european space agency soviet officials say 
the mission will help them prepare for a manned mission to mars in 
the early 21st century 
phobos ii was launched july 12 in an ambitious program to unlock 
mysteries of the red planet and its largest moon phobos 
the probe is supposed to record daily and seasonal temperature 
changes on mars make a temperature map of the surface and identify 
areas where the soil is permanently frozen tass said data on the 
planets minerals and atmosphere also will be collected 
the spacecraft is to approach within 50 yards of the moon phobos 
in early april to analyze its soil with a laser and drop two small 
landing craft onto the surface 
the phobos program is the most ambitious of nearly 20 us and 
soviet unmanned missions to study mars believed to be the planet 
most like earth after venus 
but problems have marred the 480 million mission 
in september a soviet ground controller sent an erroneous 
computer command to a sister ship called phobos i that spacecraft 
launched july 7 froze in space and ground controllers have been 
unable to communicate with it 
the probes carry similar equipment but phobos i also is equipped 
to study neutron radiation and the magnetic field around mars 
last month tass said some instruments aboard phobos ii had 
failed but that most have been fixed it said the problems would not 
prevent completion of its research 
tass said phobos ii is the first spacecraft to orbit mars 
however us officials say american probes orbited mars during the 
viking missions of the 1970s

a rembrandt and another 
17thcentury dutch painting were stolen from a government art 
warehouse and police today arrested a warehouse employee and her 
boyfriend as suspects officials said 
the two paintings man with beard a 1647 work by rembrandt 
and winter landscape with skaters a 1649 painting by jan van 
goyen were reported missing from the warehouse in this city on jan 
20 according to police spokesman nico laterveer 
rembrandt whose full name was rembrandt van rijn is the 
bestknown of all 17thcentury dutch painters 
the disappearance of the paintings was only made public today 
so as not to jeopardize the investigation laterveer said 
the two suspects identified only as a 22yearold administrative 
employee of the warehouse and her boyfriend remained in custody 
however a search of their apartment failed to yield the paintings 
which remain missing 
the incident was the latest in a series of art thefts in the 
netherlands that began last may when three paintings including a 
work by vincent van gogh and one by french impressionist paul 
cezanne were stolen from amsterdams stedelijk museum those 
paintings were later recovered 
on dec 12 three van goghs were stolen from the famed 
kroellermueller museum in the eastern netherlands no trace of 
those three paintings has been found 
laterveer estimated the value of the latest two missing paintings 
at between 474000 and 711000 
they were reported missing from a warehouse vault containing 
dozens of art works according to culture ministry spokeswoman 
annemarie stordiau 
no traces of a breakin were found at the vault or the downtown 
warehouse which ms stordiau described as very secure 
it all leads to the conclusion that somebody with regular 
access to the vault must have taken the paintings laterveer said 
he said the rembrandt measures only about 10by9 inches and the 
van goyen is only about 8by9 inches 
somebody could easily have taken the paintings out of the 
building hiding them under a coat laterveer said 
the warehouse is one of about 12 owned by the government art 
agency which takes care of about 150000 governmentowned art 
works the agency gives the art works on loan to dutch and foreign 
museums and its collection includes some of the valuable 
17thcentury dutch master works on display in amsterdams 
rijksmuseum

leaders of shiite moslem factions in 
lebanon today signed a peace treaty to end nine months of fighting 
that have killed more than 500 people 
the pact says syrianbacked forces should control security in 
south lebanon and moslem parts of beirut according to the official 
syrian arab news agency 
the agency said the eightpoint agreement was signed by syrias 
ally the amal militia and the proiranian hezbollah or party of 
god 
fighting between amal and hezbollah has aggravated lebanons 
civil war and strained ties between syria and iran the intershiite 
fighting has been halted several times through ceasefires arrange 
by syria and iran but the battles have repeatedly broken out again 
the latest peace accord was completed at a meeting in the syrian 
foreign ministry attended by leaders of the rival militias foreign 
minister farouk sharaa of syria and foreign minister ali akbar 
velayati of iran it followed a week of negotiations during clashes 
in lebanon 
in what appeared to be a setback for hezbollah the syrian news 
agency said the peace agreement gives amal control of security in 
south lebanon and emphasized that syria is the sole security power 
in moslem sectors of beirut 
the report said the pact provides for an immediate ceasefire 
exchange of prisoners an end to hostile propaganda formation of a 
joint antiisraeli operations center in south lebanon and creation 
of a committee to regulate relations between amal and hezbollah 
asked if a peace agreement might open the door to freeing western 
hostages in lebanon velayati said we hope that all hostages 
whatever their nationalities will be released very soon on the 
basis of humanitarian aspects 
he did not elaborate most of the 15 foreigners missing in 
lebanon are believed held by iranianbacked shiite factions linked 
to hezbollah 
however hezbollah leader sheik ibrahim amin said sunday that the 
hostages are not linked to a peace accord this matter has no 
relation to us nor with the agreement he said 
velayati said before todays talks that syria and iran will 
guarantee the implementation and fulfillment of the agreement 
between their lebanese allies 
amal and hezbollah which have been battling for control of 
lebanons 1 million shiites agreed late sunday to end the fighting 
after they handed over to syrian forces alleged assassins of leaders 
on both sides 
brig gen ghazi kenaan syrias military intelligence chief in 
lebanon said hezbollah delivered gunmen who killed amals leader in 
south lebanon daoud daoud and two of his lieutenants in a south 
beirut ambush sept 22 
he said an amal man accused by hezbollah of the reprisal 
assassination of sheik ali krayyem in east lebanon also was handed 
over to the syrians 
he did not identify the men or say what will happen to them 
syria the main power broker in lebanon considers that country 
its sphere of influence and vital to its regional ambitions 
tehran has long sought to establish an islamicstyle islamic 
republic there through hezbollah 
the more secular and nationalist amal seeks a lebanese government 
that would share power between moslems and traditionally dominant 
christians

a federal task force and grand jury are 
investigating whether used or bogus airplane parts are being resold 
with false certification papers to unknowing aviation companies 
no crashes have been traced to defective parts but investigators 
said such evidence often is destroyed by crashes 
were not saying a particular part is defective but theres a 
system set up to ensure their integrity and when that system is 
breached that compromises the integrity said us attorney gene 
anderson 
andersons office is conducting the investigation along with 
agents of the fbi internal revenue service defense criminal 
investigative service air force and navy the seattle times 
reported sunday in a copyright story 
anderson would not name companies targeted in the investigation 
or reveal any pending indictments he said the task force nicknamed 
nordecon for northwest defense contractors although the scope now is 
national originally was formed to examine fraud in defense 
contracts in the military and aerospace industries 
major contractors such as the boeing co in seattle may be 
victims not targets anderson said 
the task force is focusing on the production purchase and resale 
of surplus and used aerospace parts its also looking at possible 
use of counterfeit parts which dont necessarily meet 
specifications 
boeing has been subpoenaed by the grand jury and is cooperating 
with investigators said spokesman paul binder 
the investigation stems from a similar inquiry last year in which 
a florida company was convicted of misusing boeing surplus 
electrical connectors said ed easter senior manager of boeings 
surplus property operations 
miamibased southeast connectors inc and its officers were 
prosecuted for buying the surplus connectors and reselling them as 
new material to the defense department and other customers the 
companys two top executives are serving prison terms in florida 
the question of counterfeit and defective parts has emerged as a 
national issue over the past few years in several aircraft and 
defense investigations 
boeing was identified as a recipient of uncertified parts in a 
lawsuit filed in september when a connecticut company accused a los 
angeles company of selling 10000 counterfeit ball bearings to 
boeing 
according to a boeing statement filed in that suit at least 
2000 of the counterfeit bearings were installed in new commercial 
jets and the awacs radar surveillance planes

texaco inc and its biggest stockholder carl 
icahn have reached a truce that management says will allow the oil 
giant to focus full attention on remaining a leader in the energy 
business 
announcement of the pact came sunday as texaco took one of the 
final steps in its huge restructuring program by proposing to pay 
19 billion in special dividends to shareholders a step icahn 
applauded 
the company said it had signed a standstill agreement with icahn 
who hinted broadly in recent months he might try for a second time 
to gain control of texaco similar bids failed last year 
why fight when management is doing the job for you icahn 
said in a telephone interview 
texaco stock fell 475 a share to 4975 in early new york stock 
exchange trading today there had been speculation the stock might 
decline once icahn reached his agreement because it was seen as 
lessening the chances of a takeover battle that could boost texacos 
price 
the sevenyear agreement provides that icahn will not add to his 
estimated 17 percent stake in texaco and will not launch or support 
any proxy fights against management 
under the agreement texaco and icahn agreed to settle pending 
litigation texaco sued icahn last spring accusing him of 
securities law violations 
icahn said he felt texaco management had done well in recent 
asset sales particularly the 324 billion sale of its texaco 
canada interests 
i think top management at texaco during the last year has done 
a good job in making texaco leaner and more productive he said 
icahn said he also liked the idea that texaco would put the 
special dividend and any possible changes in its poison pill 
defense to a vote of shareholders a poison pill is a measure for 
preventing a hostile takeover by making acquisition of a company 
prohibitively expensive 
icahn declined to say whether he planned to sell his texaco 
stock but noted the agreement places limits on how he may do so 
the special dividends which will be submitted to shareholders 
for a vote at the annual meeting in may are part of texacos 
restructuring plan that has seen the company sell about 7 billion 
in assets since june 
texaco proposed to pay two special dividends one of 4 a share 
in notes and a second of 3 a share in cash and 1 a share in 
preferred stock for a total of 8 per share the company has about 
240 million shares outstanding 
in addition to the special dividends texaco said it planned to 
buy back 500 million of its stock by august 1990 
james kinnear president and chief executive of texaco noted the 
asset sales generated more than the 5 billion originally planned 
we have successfully completed one of the most extensive 
restructurings of assets in history measurably improving our 
competitiveness and profitability he said 
chairman alfred c decrane jr said the agreement will permit 
management to focus 100 percent on the petroleum business 
texaco announced its restructuring after emerging from bankruptcy 
law protection last spring saying it intended to distribute about a 
third of the proceeds to shareholders the combination of the 
dividends and the stock buyback exceeds that 
in addition to the 324 billion texaco canada sale texaco 
agreed to sell deutsche texaco ag for 12 billion and expects 18 
billion from its formation of a joint venture with saudi arabia to 
refine market and distribute texaco products in 23 east and gulf 
coast states 
the white plainsbased company filed for bankruptcy protection in 
1987 to avoid having to post a potentially ruinous security bond in 
its court battle with pennzoil co 
pennzoil claimed that texacos 1984 acquisition of getty oil co 
interfered with pennzoils plans to buy part of getty in 1985 a 
houston jury awarded pennzoil 103 billion texaco appealed but 
settled for 3 billion 
in june icahn lost a struggle for control of texacos board 
icahn known as a corporate raider is also head of trans world 
airlines he took control of twa in 1985 he took it private last 
year

president bush today predicted jobs in 
abundance in the years ahead and called for a new spirit of 
volunteerism in america 
john kennedy challenged us to ask ourselves what we could do 
for our country bush said at a swearingin ceremony for labor 
secretary elizabeth dole and let us each day ask what can i do 
for another person how can i make someone elses load a little 
lighter 
bush said government service plays a vital role but it must 
complement individual service 
bush began the second week of his presidency nursing the 
persistent cold that had forced him to cancel a sunday visit to the 
presidential retreat at camp david with house speaker jim wright 
pardon my voice a hoarse bush told his audience at the labor 
department 
he told the gathering largely made up of labor department 
employees you look out for the working people of america 
i want this adminstration to be about working people he 
added part of that will be excellence and responsiveness in 
goverment part of that will be holding the line on taxes and part 
of it will be a new volunteerism people helping people 
i think of the secretary who after a day at the office takes 
the time to volunteer and help a child in the neighborhood learn how 
to read he said 
with her husband senate minority leader bob dole rkan at her 
side mrs dole picked up on bushs theme of volunteerism and budget 
restraint 
we dont have unlimited funds which means we must make the 
funds we do have work for us said mrs dole who was 
transportation secretary in the reagan administration 
mrs dole said she was committed to a goal of moving beyond full 
employment to fulfilling employment for all who seek a job 
bush said there was a lot to feel good about on the labor 
front with civilian unemployment currently at its lowest level in 
14 years 53 percent in december 
therell be jobs in abundance but well have to make sure our 
workers have the skills that they need to fill those jobs with 
excellence bush added 
with one week as president under his belt bush was expected to 
get down to serious talks on budget options this week with budget 
director richard g darman 
one of those options could be a proposed new fee on deposits to 
help come up with some of the estimated 100 billion needed to shore 
up the nations ailing savings and loan industry 
chief of staff john sununu said in a broadcast interview on 
sunday that the fee remains an option despite what he called a 
firestorm of opposition on capitol hill 
critics say the proposal for a 250 fee on each 1000 on 
deposit in federally insured financial institutions would violate 
bushs nonewtaxes pledge bush and other administration officials 
said it wouldnt be a tax with sununu calling it an adjustment 
upward of the current premium structure 
sununu interviewed sunday on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley suggested that some leading democrats in congress are 
positioning themselves to deal with eventual failure on a 
bipartisan budget agreement 
if thats the attitude going in then none of us will 
succeed he said he said bush still intends to come up with a 
budget plan that meets deficitreduction targets without raising 
taxes 
the first major test of bushs leadership could come on feb 9 
when bush will outline his budget plans to a joint session of 
congress 
the president is expected to propose numerous modifications to 
the 115 trillion fiscal 1990 budget presented by former president 
reagan 
the grammrudman deficitreduction law requires a shortfall of no 
more than 100 billion in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
failure to reach that target would result in mandatory 
acrosstheboard spending cuts taken equally from domestic and 
military programs

and he was already dead the priest said 
everything was burned up everything points to the fact that 
it was caused by an electric spark because there was no light he

frank l mcnamara jr dogged by investigations 
into his actions as us attorney for massachusetts resigned today 
just three days after the majority of his assistant prosecutors 
demanded his removal 
the work of this office is far too important to be sidetracked 
by any controversy mcnamara said in a brief statement that didnt 
mention his assistants demand 
mcnamara who said he intended to return to private law practice 
said he believed president george bush and attorney general richard 
thornburgh should be afforded the opportunity to appoint a person 
of their own choosing 
mcnamara a 41yearold republican has been the target of a 
justice department investigation since november when charges that 
he saw his predecessor smoke marijuana backfired investigators 
found no evidence to support his allegations mcnamara admitted to 
smoking marijuana himself 
additional investigations questioned whether mcnamara used his 
office as a political tool over the weekend he denied urging 
politically motivated investigations of prominent democrats and 
vowed not to resign under pressure 
on friday 28 of the 39 assistant us attorneys under his charge 
wrote to thornburgh urging him to expedite mcnamaras departure 
mr mcnamaras conduct and performance while united states 
attorney is resulting in a loss of confidence in the adminstration 
of justice the letter said because mr mcnamara will neither 
resign nor step aside temporarily the credibility and operations of 
this office will continue to be damaged unless he is removed 
mcnamara has been dogged by controversy since he was nominated by 
president reagan to replace william f weld in april 1987 when weld 
was promoted to head the justice departments criminal division 
mcnamaras confirmation was held up while the fbi investigated 
irregularities in his congressional campaign finances and his 
failure to pay income tax for 1983 and 1984 until 1986 he ran 
unsuccessfully against us rep thomas p oneill jr speaker of 
the house in 1982 
during the confirmation process mcnamara said he believed weld 
was trying to scuttle his nomination and told investigators that he 
had seen weld drunk on several occasions he also alleged he had 
seen weld smoke a marijuana joint at a 1982 wedding party 
a justice department investigation failed to support mcnamaras 
charges and mcnamara was forced to admit that he had smoked 
marijuana himself at a later date 
in november several assistant prosecutors said mcnamara pursued 
an investigation of a prison land deal by the administration of gov 
michael s duakakis in an attempt to discredit dukakis then the 
democratic nominee for president 
over the weekend mcnamara denied allegations that he urged a 
federal investigation into marijuanasmoking charges against us 
rep joseph kennedy ii and robert farmer the top fundraiser for 
dukakis presidential campaign 
mcnamara said the allegation stemmed from an unsubstantiated fbi 
report that was leaked to reporters

israel will go ahead with plans to build eight 
new jewish settlements in the occupied lands this year despite the 
palestinian uprising and a slashed budget an adviser to prime 
minister yitzhak shamir said today 
michael dekel the prime ministers adviser on settlements said 
there was no shortage of idealistic pioneers to develop five new 
settlements in the west bank and three in the southern gaza strip 
the coalition agreement signed by the new government of shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc and the centerleft labor party calls for the 
building of five to eight jewish settlements 
the moment people oppose you you cannot raise your hands and 
surrender you have to struggle dekel told the associated press 
referring to the 13month palestinian revolt against israeli 
occupation in the territories 
the settlement of the state of israel is very important because 
of not despite the intefadeh he said using the arabic word 
for uprising 
dekel said he hoped the governments economic austerity plan 
which cut more than 600 million from the state budget would not 
take a toll on the settlement movement 
about 70000 jewish settlers already live in the west bank and 
gaza which israel seized during the 1967 middle east war 
many of the 17 million palestinians in the territories fear 
israel wants all their land and the settlers have become frequent 
targets of stonings and firebombings they have called on the 
government to take harsher steps against arab rioters 
although settlers have received government incentives to move to 
the occupied lands many have strong ideological commitments to the 
territory believing it is their godgiven birthright 
also today an arab mukhtar or traditional village leader was 
stabbed to death in the occupied west bank village of beit lid a 
military spokeswoman said today 
an arab reporter said mahmoud salem mahmoud 65 went to work on 
his farm sunday relatives began searching for the mukhtar when he 
failed to return home as planned and found his body which was 
stabbed in many places he said 
although the reason for the killing was unclear arab reporters 
said mahmoud may have been slain because he was suspected of working 
for the israelis 
army officials say 30 palestinians have been killed during the 
uprising by fellow arabs because they were suspected collaborators 
or informants 
in addition underground palestinian leaders of the uprising have 
called for overthrowing traditional village leaders to make way for 
younger more radical ones 
including the alleged collaborators 370 palestinians have been 
killed since the uprising began dec 8 1987 fifteen israelis also 
have been killed 
also today israeli news reports said an army officer was 
sentenced to three months in prison and six months probation for the 
shooting death of a palestinian protester in the gaza strip last 
august 
the officer a second lieutenant shot at a fleeing man who had 
led a violent protest israel army radio said 
a military court judge said the soldier did not have to shoot at 
the palestinian because the man was not endangering his life or 
those of other troops 
were not talking about a mission that must be carried out at 
any cost the judge wrote in his opinion according to army radio 
israeli newspapers also reported that defense minister yitzhak 
rabin would hold a series of meetings with local palestinian leaders 
to push his plan for elections leading to partial autonomy for the 
occupied territories the palestine liberation organization has 
rejected the proposal

for the first time since jurors began 
deliberating his fate a week ago joel steinberg entered the 
courtroom smiling amid speculation that he had been acquitted of the 
most serious charge murder he faces in the death of his 
illegally adopted daughter lisa 
steinberg a disbarred lawyer is accused of fatally beating the 
6yearold girl he and his livein companion hedda nussbaum had 
illegally obtained at birth from a long island teenager and raised 
as their own 
the death of lisa steinberg raised in an uppermiddleclass 
family has focused a new light on the issue of child abuse and the 
case has received international attention 
jurors began their eighth day of deliberations today amid 
speculation that they had acquitted steinberg of seconddegree 
murder and were considering the less serious charges of first and 
seconddegree manslaughter 
steinberg faces four charges seconddegree murder firstdegree 
manslaughter seconddegree manslaughter and criminally negligent 
homicide 
steinberg grinned broadly as he entered the courtroom shortly 
before 8 pm sunday when the judge sent the jurors home for the 
evening several hours earlier the jury had sent out a note asking 
for clarification of the terms intent and serious physical 
injury elements of manslaughter 
state supreme court justice harold rothwax had told jurors not to 
consider manslaughter unless they unanimously acquitted steinberg of 
seconddegree murder 
defense lawyer ira london said steinberg 47 feels the jury is 
giving him a fair shake what we feel good about is that this 
has not been a lynching 
at 11 am the jury began rehearing about two hours worth of 
testimony they had requested concerning steinbergs actions between 
the time lisa was injured on nov 1 1987 and the next morning 
when emergency medical service workers were called and took lisa to 
a hospital where she died several days later 
that testimony includes statements from police officers ems 
workers and hospital employees who had testified about steinbergs 
explanations for lisas condition and his reaction to her prognosis 
the jury also specifically asked to rehear ms nussbaums 
testimony of what happened the night lisa was injured among other 
things ms nussbaum testified that steinberg told her he hit lisa 
which he has denied 
the last note the jury sent out sunday indicated that they were 
considering the possibility that there was no intent on steinbergs 
part to cause injury to lisa 
seconddegree manslaughter does not include an element of intent 
but is the reckless disregard of a substantial risk of death to 
another such as steinbergs delay in getting medical help for lisa 
firstdegree manslaughter is applicable when a person intends to 
seriously injure someone and in the process the victim dies

pope john paul ii announced monday the 
vatican is studying the question of lay people assisting at mass but 
made no commitment to open those roles to women which us bishops 
have sought 
in a document on the role of the laity in church and society the 
pope condemned discrimination against women said they can play a 
greater role in church affairs and reaffirmed the ban on women 
priests 
on other issues the pope warned against excessive use of lay 
people in priestly roles said the vatican was tightening control 
over lay movements and associations and urged the laity fight for 
social justice in the political arena 
those who look for new things and concrete solutions in the 
document may be disillusioned said cardinal eduardo pironio the 
president of the pontifical council on the laity 
the argentinian prelate said the pope wisely and prudently 
asked for further study of the burning issues raised at the last 
synod 
the document the lay members of christs faithful people is 
the pontiffs response to issues raised by roman catholic bishops 
from around the world at the 1987 synod on the laity at the vatican 
american bishops at the assembly proposed that women be 
officially allowed to serve in nonordained ministries such as 
lector acolyte and altar server people who assist at mass 
others especially african bishops opposed the idea 
church law bars women from such roles but in the united states 
and some other countries women and girls sometimes fill those 
positions informally without installation 
the document disclosed a vatican commission had been formed to 
study the question of the lay ministries until the panel completes 
its work local churches should faithfully respect the current 
regulations it said 
at a vatican news conference to present the document officials 
stressed that the commission was studying all elements of 
nonordained ministries including the possibility of creating new 
minor orders apart from lector and acolyte 
belgian archbishop jan schotte secretarygeneral of the synod 
said he is president of the commission 
asked if the panel was considering opening the ministries of 
lector and acolyte to women schotte replied no but later he 
said we are studying everything nothing is excluded and nothing 
is decided 
earlier a senior vatican official said the pope appeared to be 
firing warning shots indicating that there could be more control 
over nonordained ministries rather than a decision to open them to 
women 
hes certainly not saying hold on girls your time is 
coming said the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the statements tend more toward a restrictive presence of lay 
people in ministries 
the pope did not go beyond his position set out in september in 
his document on the dignity of women including the 
reaffirmation of the ban on ordination of women priests 
the pope condemned the treatment of women as an object to buy 
and sell as an instrument for selfish interests or for pleasure 
only 
the document said women can play a greater role in 
decisionmaking in particular by serving on various dioceselevel 
councils 
asked whether the us church would be disappointed on the 
womens issue maria da graca sales of portugal a lay vatican 
adviser said concrete steps are very relative what might be 
considered concrete in the united states might be inapplicable in 
asia or africa 
the pope also said the role of men should not be neglected 
in reality various sectors in the church must lament the 
absence or the scarcity of the presence of men some of whom 
abdicate their proper church responbilities allowing them to be 
fulfilled only by women the document said

the strategic defense initiative hasnt put any 
antimissile defenses in orbit but has launched a healthy debate on 
the future of us nuclear forces says the air force general who is 
retiring tuesday after nearly five years as head of the program 
lt gen james abrahamson leaves the air force and the star wars 
program scarred from his battles with critics but still deeply 
committed to building defenses against nuclear missiles 
that goal has changed substantially however since president 
reagan called in march 1983 for the development of a spacebased 
ballistic missile defense system that speech abrahamson said in a 
farewell interview touched off a very significant debate on our 
deterrence policy 
the debate on the possibility of switching from a purely 
offensive nuclear deterrence to a mixture of offensive and defensive 
systems continued last week during senate confirmation hearings for 
defense secretarydesignate john g tower 
tower noted that aides to president bush are reviewing all 
strategic weapons and told the senate armed services committee he 
personally does not believe that we can devise an umbrella 
that can protect the entire american population from nuclear 
incineration i think thats unrealistic 
one member of the panel sen al gore dtenn noted that 
towers account represents a view markedly different from the 
publics perception of president reagans advocacy of a perfect 
defensive umbrella 
towers remarks did reflect a vision of strategic defense that 
abrahamson has been advocating for several years 
what we are adding is an improved form of deterrence 
abrahamson said in the interview no strategic defense he added 
can provide an impermeable shield against a nuclear barrage 
the president gave us a daunting goal to make it thoroughly 
reliable said abrahamson that means lets reexamine the 
strategy 
abrahamsons defense of sdi earned him a lot of enemies and he 
gives himself the worse grades in garnering support for the 
program 
i have gotten a lot of scars said abrahamson who will 
be replaced by another threestar air force general george l 
monahan jr 
abrahamson was considered for energy secretary under bush and 
has been mentioned as a possible head of the national aeronautics 
and space administration but so far his retirement plans include 
only windsurfing i love it he said 
sdi which abrahamson has headed since its start in april 1984 
has spent 16 billion on research recently scientists have been 
concentrating on less exotic weapons for the near term 
for instance an early system might use landbased missiles 
similar to the 100missile system the soviets have around moscow 
that is the limit set by the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
abrahamson listed these other upcoming tests 
the 130 million delta star or delta 183 test of a forerunner of 
the boost surveillance tracking satellite to be launched sometime 
this year using infrared ultraviolet and visible waves to spot

the defense department blocked more than 11500 
people from joining the armed forces last year because they tested 
positive for drug or alcohol abuse 
the testing program mandated by congress over pentagon 
objections began last june 1 even though it tagged more than 
11500 recruit applicants during the first seven months some 
defense officials say privately that the program isnt worth its 
cost 
the pentagon statistics obtained late last week show that only 
about 35 percent of those tested from june 1 to dec 31 were found 
to have abused marijuana cocaine or alcohol the armed forces 
rejected 11279 people for testing positive for marijuana or cocaine 
use and another 265 for alcohol abuse 
the defense department spent 31 million to develop the program 
and to conduct the tests from june through september and expects to 
spend another 48 million in fiscal 1989 which opened oct 1 
congress did not provide any money to start the program forcing the 
services to divert money from other parts of their budgets 
the statistics show that during the sevenmonth period the 
pentagon tested 322256 people for marijuana and cocaine use and 
331040 for alcohol abuse during the same period the totals differ 
because the alcohol test is done with a breath device and results 
are immediate while the urine exam for drug use requires laboratory 
analysis 
the 35 percent positive rate for recruits compares with a rate 
of about 48 percent for people already on active duty 
the number of recruit positives is well below the activeduty 
rate which demonstrates what we already knew those coming in are 
no longer aggravating the drug problem said one defense official 
who declined to be identified 
its nice to be able to test but its not cheap and as time 
goes on the number of people who test positive is going to drop as 
applicants realize that everyone is going to get tested at this 
point and you cant escape it the official said 
the pentagon opposed recruit testing from the beginning because 
of the expense and because once in uniform all those in the service 
face periodic random urine tests those tests are credited with 
helping drive drug use within the military to record low levels 
military officials also objected to the testing of recruit 
applicants because the tests would not be random or a surprise all 
recruits are tested when they show up at a military entrance 
processing command station 
despite those arguments congress embraced legislation sponsored 
by sen ernest f hollings dsc in 1987 and ordered the defense 
department to begin testing all recruit applicants 
hollings has described the program as logical and long 
overdue adding the time to start catching the users is before 
they join the armed forces when the government has no obligation to 
them 
former defense secretary frank c carlucci in a directive last 
spring implementing the law said the armed services at their 
discretion could give a second chance to people who flunk the first 
test 
he specified however that anyone who flunked the test for 
marijuana or alcohol abuse could not be offered a second chance for 
six months and that someone who flunked for cocaine use had to wait 
at least one year 
maj david super a pentagon spokesman said it was too early for 
any results to have been compiled on second tests

the justice department has recommended 
conservative federal appeals judge kenneth w starr as the new us 
solicitor general department sources said monday 
if nominated by president bush and approved by the senate starr 
42 would serve as the federal governments chief representative 
before the supreme court 
i understand its a done deal said one department source 
speaking on condition of anonymity bush hasnt done anything on 
it but we wouldnt have recommended it formally if we didnt think 
it suited his personnel people 
a senior department official said starr who was born in vernon 
texas was at the top of our list for the solicitor job 
starr was a clerk for former chief justice warren e burger and 
later a partner with the los angeles law firm of gibson dunn amp 
crutcher he served as counselor to attorney general william french 
smith from 1981 until his appointment to the us circuit court of 
appeals for the district of columbia in 1983 
his secretary said monday he would not be available for 
interviews 
starr had been mentioned as a possible supreme court nominee 
following the 1987 retirement of justice lewis powell 
moving from a federal judgeship to the solicitor general post has 
been a route to the supreme court in the past justice thurgood 
marshall gave up a seat on the 2nd circuit to become solicitor 
general in 1965 two years later president johnson named him to the 
high court 
the solicitor general is the governments chief appeals lawyer 
arguing cases before the supreme court and deciding whether to 
appeal lower court decisions against federal agencies 
in legal circles the solicitor is known as the 10th justice 
because the high court traditionally has relied upon him to provide 
legal guidance 
bruce fein a conservative columnist and an attorney who was an 
associate deputy attorney general during president reagans first 
term hailed the recommendation of starr who he said in a november 
1988 column epitomizes the reagan judicial legacy 
he said monday that starr has the perfect temperament and style 
for advocacy before the supreme court and resists flamboyance or 
extravagant statements his opinions have been earmarked by 
conservative instinct yet openmindedness theres no ideological 
fervor fein said 
colleen oconnor spokeswoman for the american civil liberties 
union said starr was a question mark but all the signals that 
have come out of the bush administrations justice department do not 
seem all that different from what weve seen in the past 
in some recent cases starr has joined with other appellate court 
members to uphold first amendment rights in one he helped reject a 
libel suit against the washington post by the former president of 
mobil corp and in another he wrote that critical comments about a 
marxist professor included in a rowland evans and robert novak 
column were entitled to absolute first amendment protection 
in other cases he helped overturn courtimposed limits on the 
number of inmates housed in the district of columbias prisons and 
helped throw out the dc fire departments affirmative action 
hiring plan 
starr received his bachelors degree from george washington 
university in 1968 got a masters degree from brown university in 
1969 and was graduated from duke university law school in 1973 
if approved starr would succeed charles fried who has left the 
solicitor office to return to harvard university law school

a judge today ordered the government to free 
on 2 million bail a koreanborn american businessman charged with 
attempting to export tons of nerve gas bombs 
us district judge h lee sarokin said the government failed to 
convince him that juwhan yun would flee prosecution if he were 
released on bail 
yun 48 has pleaded innocent to charges of conspiring to violate 
the arms export control act by seeking to ship overseas 500 
quarterton bombs of sarin a nerve gas the government says the 
bombs may have been intended for iran 
nothing is more abhorrent to our free society than the spectre 
of persons accused of crimes being confined in prisons before trial 
and conviction sarokin wrote in an opinion ordering yuns release 
the right to be free on bail before trial is what distinguishes 
our democracy from totalitarian governments he added 
yun has been in custody since his arrest jan 12 
under the bail agreement yun was ordered to forfeit his passport 
and those of his family he also agreed to be confined to his home 
and to have all international telephone calls to his home monitored 
by the us attorneys office 
a magistrate revoked bail for yun on jan 20 after prosecutors 
said the classified government documents written in english and 
korean were found on a desk at his importexport business komex 
international corp in summit 
yuns attorney stephen dratch argued last week that his client 
was a victim of entrapment claiming the government had overstepped 
its bounds during the investigation 
sarokin made his decision after reading transcripts of taped 
conversations and copies of intercepted facsimile messages provided 
by the government 
yun sarokin said would be unlikely to flee because his wife and 
three children and his mother reside with him 
bail will be secured by yuns house in short hills worth 
650000 and a new york city condominium worth 250000 the judge 
said

a university food center is trying to 
concoct a better beef stew to combat the unsavory reputation of c 
rations 
rutgers universitys center for advanced food technology backed 
by a 15 million grant from the department of defense is seeking 
to come up with food palatable to the armed forces as well as the 
civilian population 
beef stew has been declared the first new c ration creation 
all told we envision a process that with a minimum of change 
could make what the armed forces want in pouches and what the 
consumer wants in other products said jack l rossen associate 
director of the rutgers center 
the 5year project will employ researchers from industry and the 
university who hope to develop highly automated processes that would 
allow americas larger foodprocessing companies to enter combat 
ration production rossen said the market is now dominated by 
smaller companies because product demand is so low 
but why beef stew as a benchmark 
because its tasty popular and has a lot of variations

the judge in the irancontra case said today 
that former president reagan should remain subject to call in 
the trial of fired national security council aide oliver north and 
that portions of reagans personal diary might be needed at norths 
trial 
us district judge gerhard gesell quashed norths subpoena for 
president bush to testify he said north had made no showing that 
bush has any specific information relevant and material to the 
charges against north 
gesell refused to quash norths subpoena for reagans testimony 
but said in his threepage order there would be further proceedings 
if it is found necessary to call the former president as a witness 
in the trial 
the judge said there shall be no restriction placed upon 
reagan by the subpoena unless the court entered another order after 
hearing objections from the justice department and private counsel 
to reagan 
gesell acting a day before norths trial on 12 felony charges 
begins quashed with one narrow exception norths subpoena for 
reagans personal diary 
but the judge said portions of the diary might become part of the 
trial if at some point norths defense team supports a claim 
that president reagan ordered directed requested or with advance 
knowledge condoned any of norths alleged criminal activities in 
the diversion of iranian armsales profits to the contra rebels in 
nicaragua 
in that event said gesell an appropriate production 
procedure must be developed for reviewing the former presidents 
diary and determining whether any of the entries support norths 
assertions 
north contended in testimony at the congressional irancontra 
hearings in 1987 that all of his activities were authorized by 
superiors in the reagan administration and that he reported to 
former national security advisers robert mcfarlane and john m 
poindexter 
gesells order implemented a tactic he had indicated at a hearing 
friday he would use with regard to reagans testimony 
president reagan shall remain subject to call on the 
subpoena served by norths lawyers last month for the 
expresidents testimony said todays order 
gesell said friday that circumstances may change as evidence is 
introduced at the trial and that testimony of certain individuals 
may become relevant 
gesell said that with regard to norths subpoena for bush the 
former nsc aides lawyers have made no showing that president bush 
has any specific information relevant and material to the charges of 
the indictment which makes it necessary or appropriate to require 
his appearance 
since norths indictment last march his lawyers won dismissal of 
four of the original 16 counts including the key charges arising 
from the diversion of the money to the nicaraguan rebels 
but the retired marine lieutenant colonel still faces a host of 
other charges that carry a maximum possible sentence of 60 years 
imprisonment and fines totaling 3 million his trial is set to 
begin tuesday 
the dismissal earlier this month of charges that north conspired 
with poindexter and two arms dealers to finance the secret war 
in nicaragua with armssale proceeds basically leaves allegations 
that he covered up his activities by lying 
the former national security council aide is charged with making 
false statements to congressional committees in 1985 that were 
investigating reports he and others were helping the rebels in 
violation of a ban on such assistance 
three falsestatement and obstruction charges allege that north 
prepared false responses to written queries from congressional 
committees the letters denying that north or other nsc staffers 
were improperly assisting the contras were signed by mcfarlane then 
national security adviser 
mcfarlane pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of withholding 
information from congress and is expected to testify against north 
as a witness for irancontra prosecutors 
north also is charged with obstructing an august 1986 inquiry by 
the house permanent select committee on intelligence he is accused 
of falsely denying during a meeting with panel members at the white 
house that he helped the contras 
four other obstruction and false statement charges stem from 
actions north allegedly took after the irancontra affair became 
public in november 1986 
he is charged with obstructing the presidential inquiry ordered 
by president reagan by making false statements to thenattorney 
general edwin meese iii and by destroying national security council 
documents while justice department investigators were conducting the 
probe 
the false statements included norths denial that the nsc staff 
was involved in the diversion of armssale profits to the nicaraguan 
rebels known as contras the indictment charges 
an obstruction of congress charge alleges that north helped 
prepare a false chronology of the usiran arms sales for an 
appearance by poindexter before the house and senate intelligence 
panels 
prosecutors also hope to prove that north personally benefited 
from his involvement with the irancontra affair north is charged 
with accepting the installation of a 13000 security fence around 
his great falls va home that was allegedly paid for by arms 
dealer richard v secord another codefendant the offense carries 
a twoyear sentence 
one of the four charges dropped against north was an allegation 
that he prepared false documents to obstruct the grand jurys 
investigation of the fence us district judge gerhard a gesell 
ruled that the charge was legally defective because the alleged 
obstruction occurred a month before the irancontra grand jury was 
impaneled on jan 28 1987 
he is also charged with converting to his personal use at least 
4300 of the 90000 in travelers checks that contra leader adolfo 
calero gave him to help defray costs of helping the rebels 
that offense carries a 10year sentence and a 250000 fine most 
of the other charges carry fiveyear sentences including a charge 
that he conspired to use a taxexempt foundation illegally to help 
raise money to arm the contras 
two conservative fundraisers carl spitz r channell and 
richard r miller have pleaded guilty to related charges and are 
prepared to testify against north about efforts to raise 32 
million from private donors for the nontax exempt purpose of 
financing the contras 
poindexter secord and arms dealer albert hakim are to be tried 
separately from north 
it is likely that the major irancontra conspiracy charges will 
be dismissed against them as well because the government is 
unwilling to allow disclosure of classified information contained in 
prosecution exhibits 
poindexter the former national security adviser is charged with 
obstructing congress and making false statements to various 
congressional investigations secord and hakim are also charged with 
conspiring to pay illegal gratuities by installing the security 
fence and setting up a swiss bank account for norths children

phalange party leader george saade passed a cemetery monday in 
christian east beirut killing three people and wounding 17 police 
reported saade escaped injury

was an assassination attempt because the route i took is not 
the road i usually take to my office i decided only minutes 
before leaving my house to take this route 
in damascus shiite moslem militias sponsored by syria and iran 
signed a peace agreement aimed at ending a 9monthold war in south 
lebanon and beiruts moslem sector in which more than 500 people

bombing in beirut this month eleven people have been killed and 47 
wounded

forces the main christian militia accused the syrias intelligence 
service it said the syrians or their secret hands are again 
resorting to the cowardly car bombing method that has filled their 
bloody record in lebanon 
there was no response from syria which has 40000 soldiers in 
lebanon and has become its chief power broker during more than 13 
years of sectarian civil war 
more than a dozen carbomb assassination attempts have been made 
on moslem and christian government leaders politicians and militia 
commanders since the civil war began 
a red renault packed with an estimated 110 pounds of tnt exploded

surrounded the phalangist leader immediately and fired in the air 
to prevent anyone from approaching while we helped him out of his 
damaged car we then put him in another car and sped off 
saade whose party is a traditional force in the christian 
community said on his partys voice of lebanon radio later that he 
did not believe the bomb was meant for him 
he said he thought is was intended to disrupt arab league efforts 
to resolve a political crisis that threatens lebanon with permanent 
partition along sectarian lines 
some people wanted to scuttle this initiative he said but 
did not elaborate 
an arab league committee in tunis is trying to reconcile 
lebanons rival moslem and christian governments so parliament can 
name a president to replace amin gemayel whose sixyear term ended 
sept 22 gemayels father the late pierre gemayel founded the 
phalange 
the voice of lebanon quoted gen michel aoun acting prime 
minister of the christian cabinet as saying from tunis the bombing 
was directed at the reconciliation meetings and legitimate 
security in christian east beirut 
in damascus the mainstream amal militia and fundamentalist 
hezbollah or party of god sponsored by syria and iran 
respectively signed an eightpoint peace accord at the foreign 
ministry syrias official news agency reported 
leaders of the militias and the two foreign ministers worked out 
the agreement which calls for an immediate ceasefire and exchange 
of prisoners it also decrees an end to hostile propaganda and 
provides that a joint operations center against israel be 
established in south lebanon 
amal which means hope in arabic and hezbollah have been 
struggling for supremacy among the 1 million shiites who make up 
lebanons largest sect 
in an apparent setback for hezbollah the agreement gives amal 
control of security in south lebanon and emphasizes that the syrian 
army is responsible for security in beiruts moslem areas 
hezbollah was seeking to set up an islamic republic in south 
lebanon along the lines of ayatollah ruhollah khomeneis iran and 
also had been trying to expand into west beirut from its base in the 
south beirut slums 
under the agreement both sides also agree not to harm un 
peacekeeping forces or the personnel of international 
organizations in lebanon the syrian news agency said 
fundamentalist shiites have clashed frequently with un 
peacekeepers in south lebanon and several foreigners working for 
humanitarian agencies have been kidnapped 
sheik ibrahim amin a hezbollah leader said there was no 
connection between the peace agreement and western hostages in 
lebanon this matter has no relation to us or with the 
agreement he said 
most of the 15 missing westerners who include nine americans 
are believed held by shiite factions linked to hezbollah

the official journalists union called 
for legalizing underground publications and invited back members 
expelled for independent political views a news report said monday 
the calls come after months of increasing openness in the 
domestic press and growing debate among national leaders over social 
and economic reform 
in an unusual admission of a personal change of heart the 
communist partys chief ideologist janos berecz told the 
journalists gathering he realized he must now stand on the side 
of reform said the magyar nemzet daily 
he has been considered a conservative hardliner but he has made 
recent remarks that were surprisingly proreform 
his statement at the journalists conference suggested that 
reformers have gained the upper hand in the party in the battle over 
social and ecnomic changes 
over the weekend politburo member imre pozsgay made the 
startling statement that the 1956 uprising that was crushed by 
soviet tanks should be seen as a popular revolt officials have 
called it a counterrevolution for 30 years 
during a weekend conference the staterun journalists union 
said journalists should be allowed to make their own decisions 
without waiting for approval from higher officials berecz appeared 
to sanction this stand 
he said the party is not quite capable of directing the 
processes the newspaper reported it also quoted him as saying 
the media are not open enough to give free scope to fresh 
initiatives 
hungarys official media has become increasingly open reporting 
on issues once considered taboo new publications have sprung up 
that would not have been permitted a year ago 
at its weekend meeting the 6000member union also condemned 
discriminatory policies toward samizdat or underground publications 
we recognize the right of the samizdat publications to 
existence even if until recently such newssheets were 
harassed the newspaper quoted the meetings final document as 
saying 
the conference also expressed support for a proposal to readmit 
union members who were unjustly discriminated against after the 
communists took power in 1948 the 1956 uprising and hungarys 
participation in the 1968 warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia 
scores of journalists were expelled from the union for their 
independent views after those events

he often had denied charges by exiles that tibetans continue to 
be arrested and persecuted for voicing opposition to chinese rule 
in recent years however tibets secondhighest priest openly 
discussed the sufferings of tibetans since the communist army 
occupied the sparsely populated mountain area in 1950 
the panchen rinpoche fought for the rights of the tibetan 
people during the most difficult period said a statement from the 
dalai lamas european headquarters in zurich he was indeed a 
freedom fighter his sudden demise is a great loss and i am deeply 
grieved 
he declared three days of mourning to be observed in dharmsala 
the indian homeinexile shared by the dalai lama and some of the 
100000 tibetans who fled with him 
as recently as last week the panchen lama admonished chinas 
repressive rule in tibet said the statement he noted that 
chinas mistakes in tibet were greater than their successes 
it was one of the panchen lamas strongest statements and was 
quoted by two official chinese dailies which reported that he also 
said tibetans have paid too high a price for their development under 
the chinese 
recently the panchen lama had echoed the dalai lamas calls for 
more autonomy for tibetans 
kesang tseten was born in february 1938 in qinghai the province 
northeast of tibet that also has a large tibetan population at age 
3 he was named by tibetan religious leaders as one of three 
candidates considered possible reincarnates of the ninth panchen 
lama who died in 1937 
after several years of wrangling and championed by the chinese 
communists kesang was approved as the 10th panchen lama on june 3 
1949 
despite his support for the communists the chinese jailed the 
panchen lama for 20 months during the cultural revolution and kept 
him under house arrest for nine years he was allowed to return to 
tibet only in 1982 
it could take several years to determine the 11th panchen lama

olympic diver bruce kimball was sentenced 
today to 17 years in prison for killing two people and injuring four 
others when his car plowed into a group of teenagers last august 
the 1984 olympic silver medalist who was legally drunk at the 
time must serve an additional 15 years probation hillsborough 
circuit judge harry lee coe ruled 
you must be punished coe told kimball after the 3hour 
sentencing hearing you must suffer the consequences of drunken 
driving and we must stop it 
the 15year probation will include community work aimed at 
teaching young people the dangers of alcohol coe said 
kimball 25 has been in jail since earlier this month when he 
pleaded guilty to two drunken driving manslaughter and three great 
bodily injury counts 
today he changed the plea to no contest a technical move aimed 
at making it easier for victims to recover damages from his 
automobile insurance company 
kimball dressed in a blue jail uniform stood impassively before 
the judge during the hearing he did not react visibly when the 
sentence was read 
under state sentencing guidelines kimballs penalty had to fall 
between seven and 22 years 
coe who also revoked kimballs license noted that most 
prisoners serve only 20 percent to 30 percent of their sentences 
under those circumstances kimball could be free in as few as three 
years 
prosecutors said kimball who had a blood alcohol count of twice 
the legal limit was driving 75 mph on a darkened road near brandon 
just outside of tampa on aug 1 when his car plowed into a group of 
teenagers gathered at a dead end 
assistant state attorney john skye said kimball was not just a 
little careless he was not just a little negligent 
the accident occurred while kimball was in training to qualify 
for the 1988 us olympic team he was released on bond families of 
the victims attended the olympic trials in indianapolis to protest 
his quest for a place on the team kimball failed to qualify 
about 25 people including attorneys and members of both 
kimballs and the victims families stood before the bench as coe 
read the sentence 
kimballs parents had tearfully asked for mercy for their son 
coe indicated he listened to their plea noting that the sentence 
had to reflect punishment and deterrence but at the same time 
show credit for honesty and lack of intent in the accident

peter duran was moved to rewrite the language read 
by blind north americans when he presented awards to four women who 
had translated a math book into braille 
he gave one woman an award for translating questions into the 
literary code another got an award for translating equations into 
the math code the third award was for handling the text code for 
geography and the last was for translating computer exercises 
none of these ladies could read the others code yet an 
11yearold is supposed to get all this stuff duran said this 
was the final straw 
duran and four other blind men from academia and industry have 
launched a battle to unify the system of dots into one consistent 
language 
the current braille system is one of the blind childs greatest 
handicaps according to the first newsletter from braille research 
and literacy inc durans group brl intends to remove this quite 
unnecessary burden by creating a single unified but simple braille 
code 
floyd cargill chairman of the braille authority of north 
america the standardsetting organization for braille says braille 
works and does not need fixing the national federation of the blind 
has not taken a stance one way or the other 
braille patterns of one to six raised dots in various 
combinations represent the letters a through z and 37 other 
combinations form common contractions or symbols the 64th possible 
cell is a blank space 
the five common braille codes literary math computer 
geography and music share the 26 symbols representing the 
alphabet but the other 37 can have entirely different meanings from 
code to code 
a semicolon in the literary code is a 2 in the math code and 
some contradictory symbols are much more confusing a blind student 
may grow up believing there are different kinds of periods but be 
unable to distinguish between open or closed parentheses a 
significant handicap when working with a computer 
in print you almost have an infinite variety of squiggles that 
you can use to form letters and numbers and punctuation not to 
mention type styles said abraham nemeth the blind designer of the 
internationally recognized nemeth braille math code 
those 64 braille symbols have got to make do for all the 
notations that you have in print nemeth added 
he said a unified braille code could encourage some blind people 
to rely less on tape recordings and audio computer programs in 
business and education 
tim cranmer director of research for the national association 
for the blind and a designer of the computer code for braille 
supports unifying the braille codes by building on the existing 
modes 
it would be a mistake to invent a new code cranmer said 
what we want to do is combine the best elements of the existing 
codes so there would be very little learning to do 
but as far as duran and his associates are concerned developing 
the new code with the help of a computer programmed for coding 
theory is the easy part convincing people of the need to adapt is 
the hard part 
when theyve accumulated adequate backing duran physicist john 
covici computer programmers richard gage and robert lagrone and 
job placement specialist don breda will launch a national effort to 
sway people toward a better braille 
duran noted that many magazines and technical manuals are never 
read by the blind because they are too complicated to translate and 
said a unified code could make it easier to produce more current 
reading material 
the reality is that theres so few books and it takes so long 
to produce them that theyre out of date said duran 46 whose 
computer products company provides computer access to the blind and 
visually impaired through audio accessories and largeprint screens 
we have to convince adults that theres more to read if 
theyre willing to change a litle and to grow theyll have more 
access to the world than they ever realized

americans favor stringent new antiterrorist 
measures to bolster international airline security but by a wide 
margin they say poor airplane maintenance is a greater threat than 
terrorism a poll has found 
a majority in the media generalassociated press survey said 
current airline security is inadequate nearly threequarters 
favored mandatory handsearches of all checked bags and half backed 
a ban on carryon bags 
still terrorism was not seen as the chief danger to air 
travelers nearly twothirds of the respondents said inadequate 
airplane maintenance was a greater threat than terrorism while just 
24 percent saw terrorism as the greater hazard twelve percent had 
no opinion 
the national survey of 1162 adults found majority backing for 
us military strikes against countries that support terrorists but 
only if the support were proved and innocent civilians were not 
killed 
opinion was sharply divided on whether military retaliation would 
deter terrorists but majorities said the united states can take 
steps to reduce terrorism 
the survey which had a threepoint margin of error was 
conducted by telephone jan 412 the month after a terrorist bomb 
downed pan am flight 103 over scotland killing all 259 aboard and 
11 on the ground 
in response to the attack the federal aviation administration 
ordered us airlines to xray all checked baggage on flights from 
europe and the mideast the poll found support for other steps some 
considerably tougher 
ninetysix percent said foreign airlines should be required to 
xray checked baggage 
seventythree percent supported requiring airlines to 
handsearch all checked baggage on international flights even if 
passengers had to check in three hours before takeoff that is the 
practice on israels el al airline the leader in antiterrorist 
measures 
half supported banning carryon luggage on international 
flights such a ban has been used by british airways on flights into 
belfast northern ireland during periods of political tension 
fiftyseven percent said airlines should be required to announce 
all terrorist threats they receive but respondents were split 
evenly on whether the government should announce all threats it 
receives against airlines 
that issue arose when it was revealed that us officials were 
warned before the pan am attack that a bombing was imminent but did 
not reveal the threat officials said they get warnings virtually 
daily cannot verify them and could cripple the airline industry by 
announcing them 
the poll asked if the government should announce terrorist 
threats even if it gets them on a daily basis and cannot tell if 
they are legitimate fortyfive percent said yes 45 percent said no 
and the rest were not sure 
on military retaliation 55 percent said the united states should 
strike against other nations if it has proof they supported 
terrorists who attacked us citizens the sentiment spanned 
ideologies but was backed more by men 64 percent than women 45 
percent 
however nearly a third of those who supported military strikes 
said they would change their view if the action might kill innocent 
people only a third of the respondents favored strikes in which 
civilians could die 
moreover an 84 percent opposed military retaliation if the 
united states lacked direct proof of another nations involvement 
opinion was split on the effect of a us attack on a nation that 
supports terrorism nearly onethird said that would only provoke 
more terrorist attacks while a third said it would be a deterrent 
the rest either said it would have no effect or had no opinion 
still six in 10 said the united states can take steps to reduce 
terrorist attacks significantly and 57 percent said the government 
should be doing more to protect americans from terrorism

foreign ministers of iran and iraq may meet 
in new york next week if the united nations secretarygeneral 
believes it would be helpful a senior iraqi official said monday 
the two sides have agreed to hold direct talks on curbing 
violations of the aug 20 gulf war ceasefire but no date has been 
set for the military committee to meet 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz plans to be in new york next 
week when the un security council reviews the mandate for its 350 
ceasefire observers deputy foreign minister nizar hamdoon told the 
associated press 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati also is expected 
there he said he added that un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar would decide on a bilateral meeting 
jan eliasson the un special envoy said sunday the decision 
would be made after perez de cuellar assesses results of the talks 
in iran and iraq 
eliasson swedens un ambassador left baghdad for new york on 
monday 
his talks were aimed at resuming unsponsored peace 
negotiations that broke down aug 25 over troop withdrawals and 
ownership of the shatt alarab waterway 
before leaving eliasson said the two sides agreed to form a 
joint military working group to include commanders from iran and 
iraq as well as un peacekeepers it would work on military 
problems of a technical nature along the 740mile ceasefire line 
he said 
hamdoon said the agreement was a step forward but others were 
needed 
it helps to stabilize the ceasefire but we dont think it 
will be sufficient just to have a committee and sit back without an 
peace agreement he said

canada pulled out of joint coldweather 
military exercises monday the morning after eight soldiers were 
killed in the crash of a c130 transport plane trying to land in icy 
fog at 50 degrees below zero 
the fourengine hercules was carrying eight crewmen and 10 
paratroopers from edmonton alberta to participate in brim frost 
89 when it crashed sunday night at the end of the runway at fort 
wainwright said us army maj sherrel mock 
three men were in serious condition one was listed as stable and 
six others were being held for observation at the bases bartlett 
army community hospital mock said monday 
we dont know if the cold weather had anything to do with it 
mock said teams are out there right now going through the 
wreckage 
the investigation is still in its early stages theyre 
wondering if it was the weather or something mechanical 
a 450man canadian paratroop force was to support the us armys 
1st brigade 6th infantry division light in a major land battle 
that was the centerpiece of the brim frost ground exercises near 
fairbanks 
but after the crash canadian officials canceled their forces 
participation and recalled their remaining aircraft and soldiers 
mock said 
they canceled because of the equipment they lost in the 
crash mock said the aircraft was bringing in equipment 
ranging from snow machines to cold weather gear 
military planners call brim frost the premier cold weather 
training exercise in the free world but temperatures plunging to 
more than 60 below zero during the past two weeks have been too much 
of a test 
the bitter cold has caused metal fatigue and rubber fatigue in 
trucks and aircraft stalling equipment and generally slowing 
maneuvers mock said 
but weve been able to land aircraft he said 
another canadian c130 had landed an hour earlier he said 
the third aircraft in the flight was diverted to the fairbanks 
airport because the runway was blocked 
the planes last contact with the control tower was at 647 pm 
there were no distress calls from the crew before the crash mock 
said there was no explosion or fire after the plane broke in two 
and skidded to a halt about a quartermile down the runway he said 
they were able to get into the aircraft as soon as the 
emergency vehicles began arriving mock said with that type of 
crash with the fuselage burst you have a problem with cold 
weather but to my knowledge none of the injuries was due to the 
cold 
six victims were dead on arrival at the army hospital and two 
others died later he said 
about 26000 servicemen 120 aircraft and 1000 vehicles from the 
us army air force marines coast guard national guard civil 
air patrol reserve units and canadian forces were participating in 
the arctic training exercise the 15 million exercise began jan 20 
and is to continue through feb 1 
lockheed c130s which have a wingspan of more than 130 feet are 
military workhorses used to transport soldiers and equipment first 
delivered to the us military in 1956 they have been involved in 
several crashes in recent years 
in the most recent crash before sunday a c130 plunged into a 
field in june about a mile short of the airport in greenville 
miss killing the six air national guardsmen on board 
but joe dabney a spokesman for lockheed aeronautical systems co 
in marietta ga said monday the hercules has been one of the most 
popular and longestrunning transport planes ever produced 
more than 1870 c130s in more than 50 versions have been 
delivered to operators in more than 60 nations dabney said 
he said c130s were introduced to the antarctic in 1960 and are 
flown in both the arctic and antarctic by the us military 
the c130s safety and reliability record in both polar regions 
has been outstanding the c130s used in the arctic and the 
antarctic are skiequipped as well as wheeled versions of the 
hercules aircraft dabney said 
the lockheed c130 is one of the worlds safest and most 
reliable transports and is the most widely used airlifter of its 
type in the world

68yearold blind man who had been prepared to sell a prized 
possession a season ticket on the 45yard line to denver broncos 
games 
after 22 years as a season ticket holder bobbie shepard figured 
the football clubs 40 boost in saeason ticket prices was too much

tried to eat my breakfast but i couldnt get it eaten every time i 
took a bite the phone would ring again 
by the time it stopped shepard had 15 offers to pay for his 300 
ticket 
by 10 am boulder lawyer dan caplis had arrived at shepards 
home and handed him a check for the 300 and offered to pay for the 
ticket every season shepard wants it 
im happy to do it caplis said i think the broncos need 
more fans like bobbie it just seemed to me that he was a gutsy 
courageous guy and he should be there it only seems right

police are investigating the apparent suicide of 
the estranged daughter of the founder of a polygamist cult because 
of the cults reputation for blood atonement against defectors 
lillian chynoweth 33 a daughter of the late ervil lebaron 
founder of the church of the lamb of god was shot once in the head 
lt richard holland said 
mrs chynoweth was found dead in her houston home saturday by her 
13yearold daughter who was awakened by the gunshot a 
357caliber pistol was nearby 
the pistol holland said had been given to mrs chynoweths 
14yearold son by a family friend for protection in light of the 
killings last june of mrs chynoweths husband her brotherinlaw 
and a niece 
there were no signs of forced entry or foul play holland said 
in addition he said mrs chynoweth had been seeking treatment for 
depression and had recently talked of suicide 
preliminary evidence points to suicide but the investigation 
is ongoing holland said we are approaching it cautiously 
because of the history of the family 
last june 27 mrs chynoweths 36yearold husband mark was 
found shot dead in his office at his houston appliance store 
minutes later his brother duane 31 and duanes daughter 
jennifer 10 were found shot to death in the driveway of a vacant 
home where they had been called under the guise of delivering a new 
washing machine 
at the same time eddie marston 32 one of ervil lebarons 
stepsons and charged but never convicted as a killer for lebaron 
was shot in irving 
the killings remain unsolved 
it is reasonable to conclude that some of the things that 
caused her depression were related to the murder of her husband 
holland said 
mrs chynoweths brother isaac lebaron 20 committed suicide in 
1983 he had suffered massive depression and had been released 
from a hospital the day before his death 
isaac lebaron was instrumental in the conviction of ervil 
lebaron sentenced to life in utah state prison in 1979 for ordering 
the murder of utah polygamist rulon allred he later died in prison 
ervils death in 1981 prompted the chynoweths defection from the 
cult and their move to houston holland said 
ervil believed he was the one mighty and strong prophet of 
god and vowed in 1970 after a split with his brother joel that 
blood will run to solve our problems 
the lebaron group is believed responsible for at least 18 
killings the current leaders appear to operate from mexico

president bush may not be seeing the dogwoods 
bloom this spring at camp david because of a devastating fungus 
disease that could become a national epidemic among the native 
trees the agriculture department said monday 
usda plant geneticist frank s santamour said that the disease 
has swept through native dogwood seedlings at a test site near the 
presidential retreat in marylands catoctin mountains the seedlings 
were from 17 states and proved highly susceptible to anthracnose 
disease 
they all declined in vigor and after two years 75 percent were 
dead santamour said he predicted that all of the test seedlings 
will be dead by the end of 1989 
santamour who works for the departments agricultural research 
service at the national arboretum in washington said no north 
american flowering dogwood trees of the species cornus florida are 
known to resist the disease 
asiatic or chinese dogwood cornus kousa which produces flowers 
similar to c florida showed some leaf spotting from the disease 
but otherwise were said to have performed well in santamours study 
the fungus that causes dogwood anthracnose has not been 
identified exactly he said but there appears to be no insect 
carrier of the fungus as with dutch elm disease the dogwood fungus 
depends on wind and water to spread from tree to tree 
santamour said the origin of the disease outbreak is obscure it 
began in the late 1970s on the west coast among c nuttallii 
dogwoods and the c florida on the east coast he said 
however we can probably rule out environmental stress as a 
casual factor santamour said 
a 1984 survey of nearly 50000 dogwoods in catoctin mountain park 
by the us park service and usdas forest service confirmed 
scattered reports of the new devastating disease among the native 
dogwoods 
santamour there is probably little hope for finding native 
dogwoods resistant to anthracnose 
if the disease continues to spread nursery workers should be 
cautioned against premature judgments on relative resistance of 
plants that may have merely escaped the path of infection he said 
but santamour said he found that dogwoods planted on lawns and 
parks in the catoctin area seem to have a better survival rate that 
those in the forest 
dogwoods in the study were grown from seeds from alabama 
arkansas connecticut florida georgia kentucky louisiana 
maryland michigan missouri mississippi new jersey north 
carolina ohio oklahoma pennsylvania and virginia

ben and al kohn serve up a little sass with the 
coffee and sweet rolls at the break of dawn jolting customers awake 
before the caffeine can 
for four years the 70yearold kohn twins have opened the doors 
of the storefront coffee shop on halsted street at 3 am and 
dispensed insults and bad jokes along with the java newspapers 
cigarettes gum and other small items they sell 
i guess people feel they can face anything the day brings after 
facing the twins at 430 in the morning said police lt wayne 
wiberg a longtime patron 
another officer on the beat sgt henry pate joked they have 
only one drivers license between them one day well have to 
fingerprint them to figure them out 
although the store is only a few years old the twins have lived 
on the block all their lives no one calls them ben or al because no 
one knows which is which they are known simply as the twins 
the two were born in a building across the street from the cafe 
the youngest of 12 children they ran their fathers handrolled 
cigar and cigarette business in that building and sold hotdogs and 
beer at two ballparks for 22 years 
when the building burned down four years ago the kohns began the 
coffee shop they sleep in back on twin beds ben kohn is divorced

the place which has no name out front is simple three 
mismatched counters a big space heater that switches on and off as 
people warm their backsides a dozen bar stools a cash register and 
two worn chairs where the twins sit and look out onto the street 
when things are quiet 
despite the yelling inside the store the twins have an 
understated tolerance of ethnic differences in the bluecollar 
neighborhood they have learned to yell curse and say good 
morning and get out ya bum in yiddish spanish lithuanian 
polish italian and greek 
they go to sleep at 10 pm wake up about 1 am pick up the

the last nato base to receive us 
cruise missiles was the first to be deactivated monday under the 
terms of the superpowers arms control treaty 
in a short ceremony at the molesworth base 70 miles north of 
london members of the us air force 303rd tactical mission wing 
were advised mission complete 
reporters and photographers including several from the soviet 
news media were then permitted to tour the four empty bunkers that 
until last year housed 16 operational and two spare cruise missiles 
to me this is a milestone in the implementation of the inf 
treaty said maj gen marcus anderson commander of the 3rd air 
force referring to the arms control agreement signed by former 
president reagan and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the treaty signed in december 1987 calls for the elimination by 
1991 of 2700 soviet and us landbased intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles those with ranges of 300 to 3000 miles 
this was the first operational cruise missile unit to be 
inactivated anderson said the treaty is being implemented in 
the timetable that was presented 
anderson said the removal of the cruise missiles represented to 
him the fact that we can successfully negotiate treaties for arms 
reduction 
molesworth was one two bases in britain designated in 1980 to 
receive a total of 160 us cruise missiles although only 16 of its 
planned 64 operational missiles had arrived before the treaty was 
signed 
the other base greenham common 50 miles west of london houses 
96 missiles which are scheduled to begin leaving towards the end 
of this year said british defense ministry spokesman martin helm 
the base will be deactivated at an unspecified time before 1991 
helm said 
the missiles and their launchers left molesworth between 
september and november last year for davis montah base in tucson 
ariz to be destroyed under the watch of soviet inspectors 
the campaign for nuclear disarmament welcomed the removal of 
cruise missiles from molesworth said spokeswoman sheena philips 
but we remain concerned about natos plans to bring in new 
generations of nuclear weapons 
spraypainted in big red letters on a highway overpass near the 
base is the slogan what about the nuclear warheads 
the missile warheads which are not covered by the treaty remain 
on site although us officials have said they will be returned to 
the united states eventually 
molesworth was not closed since 160 of the its 800 american 
airmen and women are waiting to be reassigned and under the 
treaty soviet inspectors have the right to inspect the base until 
2001 to ensure the missiles have not returned 
molesworth a royal air force base is expected to remain in 
american hands although the british american and nato officials 
responsible for the decision have not announced how it will be used 
the 600acre site a world war ii bomber base was renovated to 
house cruise missiles at a cost of 79 million 
the first cruise missiles arrived in europe in 1983 and were 
deployed at greenham common the molesworth missiles were the last 
to be deployed in november 1987 
the soviets began removing some of their ss20 missiles targeted 
at western europe in february 1988 the first american missiles 
nine pershing 2s were removed sept 1 1988 from a base in west 
germany 
the last of the 16 operational and four spare cruise missiles 
stored in belgium left dec 13 making it the first western country 
to have all the required weapons withdrawn under the ussoviet 
treaty 
nato was to have deployed 572 cruise and pershing 2 missiles in 
five european countries 
officials at nato at the us air forces british and its 
european headquarters and at supreme headquarters allied powers 
europe were unable monday to say how many had so far been removed

the rev jesse jackson said monday he met with an 
adviser to president mikhail s gorbachev and other soviet officials 
in an attempt to organize a superpower telethon to aid victims of 
armenias earthquake 
jackson arrived in the soviet union on sunday to promote his plan 
for the fundraising broadcast and also to gauge political and 
economic reforms made under gorbachev soviet leader since march 
1985 
it was the first trip to the soviet union for jackson who met 
with gorbachev at the geneva summit in 1985 
the two men had been scheduled to meet again during gorbachevs 
december visit to new york but the soviet leader cut short his trip 
and returned to moscow because of the armenian earthquake 
the paradox is that this crisis gave us the opportunity to 
serve to help melt the icy walls of the cold war jackson said 
he told reporters he hoped the armenia benefit telethon would 
raise money to help buy prefabricated housing for some of the 
500000 people left homeless by the dec 7 quake that killed 25000 
people 
jackson declined to reveal details of his plans for the telethon 
saying he preferred to have everything organized first but his 
spokesman eric easter said organizers had been in touch with 
entertainers cher bill cosby bb king eddie murphy and others 
we would like it to be a simulcast say from armenia moscow 
new york and los angeles easter said he said organizers hoped 
the telethon could be organized for broadcast in march or april 
jackson the former democratic presidential candidate met monday 
with various soviet officials including gorbachev adviser anatoly 
f dobrynin the former soviet ambassador to washington and with 
the soviet minister of culture to secure the participation of 
soviet entertainers in the telethon 
he also said he met for about 1 hours with human rights activist 
andrei d sakharov the 1975 nobel peace laureate 
jackson said sakharov expressed support for organizing aid to 
armenia but was concerned about the fate of armenian activists who 
had been arrested following the earthquake 
jackson said he would meet tuesday with alexander m yakovlev a 
member of the ruling communist party politburo and with the head of 
gostelradio the soviet state broadcasting committee 
jackson is also scheduled to visit the earthquake zone in armenia 
and to meet with vasgen i the head of the armenian apostolic 
church before leaving the soviet union on friday

a jewish organization said monday it appeared 
the vatican will miss a deadline for removing a convent from the 
grounds of the world war ii nazi death camp at auschwitz 
we are severely dismayed and disappointed because it appears 
the convent will not be moved as stipulated in a 1987 agreement 
between the roman catholic church and jewish groups said elan 
steinberg executive director of the world jewish congress 
steinberg said a jewish delegation visited the area of poland 
near the death camp where the vatican undertook to build a center 
of prayer and education about the nazi holocaust and not a spade 
has been put in the ground 
under the agreement the center was also to house nuns from 
auschwitz and would be built within two years 
a dozen nuns set up a convent in 1984 in what had been a theater 
at the camp where millions of jews were killed during world war ii 
their move stirred a protest among jews who regard the site as a 
memorial to the holocaust and believe it should be left undisturbed 
the archbishop of the french city of lyon cardinal albert 
decourtray said last week that the nuns would move into a new 
convent but he did not say where or when the building would go up 
steinberg called the cardinals comments an apparent effort to 
buy time in view of the feb 22 deadline

the bush administration accused the soviet 
union on monday of pursuing a scorched earth policy in 
afghanistan as its troops head home from the wartorn country 
state department spokesman charles e redman said the soviets 
were conducting bombing raids in various areas using both planes 
based in afghanistan and others flying from soviet territory while 
also launching scud missile attacks 
by contrast redman said usarmed afghan rebels were showing 
restraint toward the departing red army which is committed to 
complete the withdrawal by feb 15 
redman gave no assessment of how fiercely the rebels were 
pursuing their war against the forces of the sovietbacked kabul 
government nor did he offer assurances the bush administration 
would promote restraint 
we support various efforts by the afghan resistance to 
formulate a political structure to replace the illegitimate regime 
in kabul redman said but it is their structure we dont 
have a particular plan of our own 
we can be helpful but in the end this is something for the 
afghan people to determine redman said 
some 50000 soviet troops are quitting afghanistan after nine 
years of fighting alongside the kabul government against the rebels 
who have received us weapons through pakistan 
both superpowers are continuing their military support 
the withdrawal was stalled temporarily late last year by moscow 
in response to intenstified rebel attacks on the soviet troops the 
soviets meanwhile stepped up their own bombing and missile attacks 
the soviets continue what might even be called a scorched earth 
policy as they continue very very intensive air activity redman 
said 
the attacks he said were both from aircraft based inside 
afghanistan as well as with aircraft based in the soviet union 
the us spokesman added we just dont believe that this kind 
of a policy is what is called for at the time when afghanistan ought 
to be looking to the future 
with tensions rising the united states decided last week to 
temporarily close its embassy in kabul and remove the staff of 11 
american diplomats and security guards the us flag was hauled 
down monday but the embassy staff did not leave 
redman said that bad weather closed the airport and that the 
americans are going to leave whenever weather conditions permit 
the embassy is near the presidential palace the state radio and 
secret police headquarters all of which would be prime guerrilla 
targets in a battle for the city 
president najibs government accused the united states of closing 
the embassy as a means of inciting the guerrillas to more intense 
warfare after the red army departs 
but rep stephen solarz dny and the chairman of the house 
foeign affairs asian subcommittee said the pullout was entirely 
justifiable 
the departure of the embassy staff will leave 10 americans in 
afghanistan all missionaries

president bush says hes not ready yet to 
reveal his views on the best way to reform the savings and loan 
system but the report of a study group he headed in 1984 may be a 
guide to his thinking 
bushs staff director for the task group on regulation of 
financial services washington attorney richard breeden joined the 
whitst week and is expected to play the key role in 
shaping the administrations sampl plan which the president hopes to 
outline in a feb 9 speeche house staff la 
much has changed since bush then vice president signed the task 
group report the magnitude of sampl insolvencies had not yet come to 
light 
but if the groups recommendations are any indication they 
suggest the president will take a cautious approach to reform rather 
than advocate a wholesale restructuring of the industry 
the 1984 study recognized what since has been identified as a key 
contributor to the problem permissive laws in some states that 
allowed sampls to stray into risky areas far removed from their 
traditional business of making home mortgage loans 
but rather than call for new regulation the group emphasized a 
system of incentives including riskbased insurance premiums and 
hignd keeping 
three separate insurance funds for banks thrifts and credit unions 
but it offered a mechanism for the financial system to evolve 
thrifts that stuck primarily to mortgage lending would remain part 
of a separate system at a certain point sampls that entered enough 
new areas becoming more like banks would have to join the bank 
regulatory system with its stricter oversight

defense minister yitzhak rabin looking for 
palestinian support for a peace plan said monday he was willing to 
work for elections in the occupied lands even if arabs did not 
immediately halt the uprising 
an influential moslem fundamentalist leader in the occupied gaza 
strip said he supported the proposal 
in gaza meanwhile soldiers shot and wounded 15 palestinians in 
stonethrowing clashes including a 16yearold girl and a 
15yearold boy who were in critical condition arab doctors said 
a 12yearold boy was taken to a hospital in israel with a 
gunshot wound to the head the doctors said the army said it was 
checking the reports 
rabin speaking on army radio said he was willing to drop his 
earlier condition that palestinians halt the violence of the 
13month uprising for several months before israel would talk about 
holding elections 
palestinians have rejected attaching preconditions to elections 
which would be the first in the territories since 1976 
rabin told legislators of his leftleaning labor party he was 
willing to hold talks immediately with palestinians only after 
agreement was reached would hostilities have to end he said 
when theres agreement on the process then a calm period will 
have to begin because to my mind if you want free elections they 
cannot take place in an atmosphere of violence rabin said 
sheikh ahmed yassin the leader of moslem fundamentalists in the 
gaza strip said he supported the proposal 
if there will be international supervision there will be more 
freedom for the palestinians and this is the right way there is no 
other way to elect the representatives of the palestinian people 
he said on israel televisions arabiclanguage show 
yassins statement apparently was aimed at the palestine 
liberation organization the moslem fundamentalist hamas movement is 
competing with the plo over influence in the occupied lands 
the latest conflict came monday when plo activists persuaded 
palestinians to ignore a hamasdeclared strike 
yassin also said he supported meetings between palestinians and 
israeli officials there is no escape from a dialogue he said 
the moslem leader said he would meet with rabin if he received an 
invitation said tv reporter yoni benmenachem who interviewed 
yassin at his gaza home 
israeli leftists have called for talks with the plo but the 
rightwing likud bloc and leaders of the mainstream labor party have 
rejected the group which most palestinians say must be their 
representative in negotiations 
likud legislators monday criticized rabin for authorizing a 
meeting between proplo leader faisal husseini who has been jailed 
for most of the 13month uprising and rabins top adviser on the 
territories shmuel goren 
i think husseini is not an appropriate route for talks i 
think if he were the defense minister wouldnt have had him sitting 
in jail for his part in the riots and violence said likud 
legislator binyamin begin son of former prime minister menachem 
begin 
husseini said after the meeting he believed the plo would support 
elections in the territories but that the balloting would have to 
be on the question of statehood and not for local representatives as 
suggested by israeli leaders 
also monday an adviser to prime minister yitzhak shamir 
announced israel will go ahead with plans to build eight jewish 
settlements in the occupied lands this year despite the arab 
uprising and budget cuts 
michael dekel shamirs adviser on settlements said there was no 
shortage of idealistic pioneers 
the moment people oppose you you cannot raise your hands and 
surrender you have to struggle dekel said in an interview 
now about 17 million palestinians and 70000 jewish settlers 
live in the west bank and gaza 
israel seized the territories in the 1967 middle east war and 
us officials have criticized the settlements as obstacles to peace 
the uprising is in protest of israeli rule of the lands since 
the revolt began 370 palestinians and 15 israelis have been killed 
the army said monday that an arab mukhtar or village leader was 
found stabbed to death in the west bank village of beit lid 
the circumstances of the slaying sunday were unclear but arab 
reporters said mahmoud salem mahmoud 65 may have been killed 
because he was suspected of working for israeli authorities 
army officials say more than 30 palestinians have been killed 
during the uprising by arabs who suspected them of being 
collaborators or informants

communist party chief stipe suvar 
battled calls for his resignation monday and told the central 
committee the country faces a stark choice between more democracy or 
neostalinism 
as liberals and hardliners clashed adm petar simic of the 
armed forces warned the military might play a more active role in 
the battle for yugoslavia 
the action took place at a key meeting of the policysetting 
central committee called to discuss demands for suvars resignation 
and a possible shakeup in the ruling elite 
suvar indirectly hit out at his chief political rival serbian 
party leader slobodan milosevic although he did not identify his 
opponent in keeping with the convention of party solidarity 
but his speech was a scathing attack on dogmatic policies 
generally attributed to milosevic party chief in the largest of 
yugoslavias six republics 
socialist political pluralism or neostalinism those are the 
two alternatives offered by different factions in the communist 
party leadership to guide yugoslavia out of its economic and 
political crisis suvar said 
speaking hours later milosevic defended his stands and called 
for sweeping changes in the leadership he blames for the current 
crisis 
it would be honest and intelligent that those who have clashed 
with the people should allow themselves to be replaced by better and 
more capable men milosevic said 
serbs demand suvars resignation and accuse him of opposing the 
peoples will by criticizing recent mass rallies organized by 
milosevic supporters 
the street gatherings have torn at the countrys fragile ethnic 
balance and led to the ouster of several opponents of milosevic who 
defends the rallies as a popular instrument of change 
milan kucan party chief of liberal slovenia told the meeting 
a feeling of revolt can be expressed on the streets but a way out 
of the crisis cannot be found there 
yugoslavia will become a democratic community or it will not 
exist said kucan 
the pragmatic suvar is supported by slovenia and his native 
croatia which favor political pluralism more democracy and radical 
marketoriented reforms as a solution to polands protracted crisis 
yugoslavias woes include a 250 percent inflation rate a sharp 
drop in living standards and an alarming increase in labor and 
ethnic unrest 
milosevic who has called for more centralized party control over 
the countrys affairs draws his support from yugoslavias poorer 
southern regions 
they fear that marketoriented reforms would end state subsidies 
for their lossmaking industries and lead to massive layoffs 
milosevic supporters suffered an initial setback at mondays 
meeting which in a show of hands overwhelmingly voted down a 
proposal to air calls for suvars resignation before the party 
chiefs speech 
suvar called for more political pluralism which is conditional 
on the competition of ideas as against the dictatorship of the 
communist party 
adm simic the political chief of the armed forces appealed to 
the meeting for party unity and indicated the army might take a more 
active role in putting a stop to confrontations between the 
republics 
what some describe as the battle for yugoslavia will not be 
waged without the yugoslav army he said 
the army has remained on the sidelines in recent political 
conflicts but senior officers show increasing unease 
the situation in yugoslavia is rapidly approaching its 
culmination the party is losing battle after battle the 
political system is breaking apart and anticommunist 
opposition has openly entered the political scene simic said

temperatures fell as low as 64 degrees 
below zero again monday but alaskas record cold eased in some areas 
as a mass of frigid air from above the arctic circle headed toward 
the lower 48 states 
movement of the huge cold air mass that has covered alaska for 
about two weeks generated high wind that produced extremely low wind 
chill factors in southern and southcentral alaska 
and because of the wind the coast guard on monday closed the 
continents northernmost icefree port valdez harbor to oil tanker 
traffic and said it may remain closed for two days 
the alaska division of emergency services reported continuing 
problems in rural alaska with such things as congealing fuel oil and 
shortages of fuel and food some villages reported power outages and 
freezing water and sewer pipes 
but the division said it knew of no immediate lifethreatening 
situations 
the alaska national guard has been on 24hour alert to help deal 
with the cold 2nd lt mike haller said eskimo scouts were helping 
chop wood near elim where there was a critical fuel shortage and 
the guard had loaned fuel to the village of tuntutuliak in western 
alaska 
haller said four alaska air national guard c130 aircraft have 
been on roundtheclock alert to deliver food or fuel to remote 
areas if needed small planes have been grounded by the cold and 
thick ice fog 
the story now is not going to be just the cold but the cold 
and the wind said bob hopkins a meteorologist with the national 
weather service in anchorage 
the coldest temperatures in the state were recorded in interior 
communities and near the canadian border at tanana the coldest 
spot in alaska early monday it was 64 degrees below zero the 
school in the town at the confluence of the yukon and tanana rivers 
was closed for the day 
sixtyfour it was 76 below here one morning said tanana cab 
service owner arvin kangas its not too bad 
during the weekend 17 alltime low temperature records across 
the state fell the weather service said 
some of the cold air had pushed 575 miles to the southeast and 
nipped juneau the temperature there was reported at one degree 
below zero the cold air was expected to reach the lower 48 by later 
in the week hopkins said 
at valdez petty officer kim arbaugh of the marine safety office 
said wind gusts had been clocked at 93 mph making the valdez 
narrows between the port and prince william sound dangerous 
without tankers picking up oil tom brennan of the alyeska 
pipeline service co said flow through the transalaska oil pipeline 
from prudhoe bay to the marine terminal at valdez would be reduced 
by 65 percent to 775000 barrels daily 
at 775000 barrels we have two and a half days storage 
capacity he said 
the temperature at valdez was a moderate 1 degree below zero but 
that combined with the wind to produce wind chill factors to 55 
below zero 
anchorage warmed to one degree below zero by early monday but 
30knot wind produced a wind chill effect of 45 degrees below zero 
that is expected to last until at least tomorrow hopkins said 
tanana commercial co coowner dale erickson said the cold has 
sparked a run on items such as matches kerosene and electrical 
heating tape to wrap around propane lines its so cold the 
propane wont work 
mayor curtis sommer said a few people had been forced out of 
their homes because of the cold but most seemed to be faring well 
the last time it was like this was 15 or so years ago sommer 
said when it gets up to 40 or 50 below it feels like springtime 
upriver in nenana the temperature early monday dipped to 62 
degrees below zero and schools there also were closed 
the temperature in bethel warmed to 24 degrees below zero and 
kusko 300 sled dog race officials said that contest would begin at

classes resumed monday at the police academy 
where one cadet died and 16 others fell ill following a boot 
campstyle workout of pushups and laps last fall 
the 37 recruits of class 13 were given haircuts and a lecture on 
nutrition monday a far cry from the strenuous regimen their 
predecessors underwent their first day according to the new head of 
the state criminal justice training council which oversees the 
training of municipal police officers 
what happened here at agawam was an extreme and not at all 
representative of what the training council intended to go on 
patrick m hamilton said 
class 13 is the first at the academy since the training session 
that left 16 cadets hospitalized in september from exhaustion and 
dehydration cadet timothy shepard of pittsfield collapsed the first 
day of class sept 19 and died nov 2 from his injuries 
the other cadets were released and allowed back to class for the 
remainder of the 14week course but several were barred from 
physical training because of the injuries 
attorney general james shannon who investigated the training 
said he found a massive failure of the bureaucracy overseeing 
it a legislative investigation into police training is under way 
as is a grand jury investigation into the training councils 
financial dealings 
an inquest into shepards death is expected to conclude this week 
and district judge irving goldblatt said he plans to issue a report 
in a few weeks on whether criminal charges should be brought against 
the state troopers who were in charge of training the class of 50 
cadets 
the tragedy however has already changed the way municipal 
police are trained in massachusetts 
the latest class of recruits from 19 police departments in 
western massachusetts opened with four hours of inspections 
instructions on rules and regulations haircuts and marching drills 
according to david dacyczyn who took over as academy director in 
the shakeup following the injuries to the cadets 
on tuesday the cadets begin physical training at the springfield 
ymca where they will undergo an hour of swimming aerobic workouts 
and other physical training daily dacyczyn said 
gone are the confusing orders shouted at cadets and hundreds of 
pushups meted out as punishment they will be treated as adults 
and physical education will not be used as a disciplinary tool 
hamilton said

officials on a formal end to irans war with iraq an end of iranian 
support for terrorism and freedom for american hostages held by 
proiranian forces in lebanon 
the administration believes that iran may have some influence 
over the groups holding the hostages 
the advent of the bush administration in washington has 
heightened speculation about the possibility of an easing of 
tensions between the two countries and an iranian effort to help 
secure the release of the nine hostages 
in his inaugural address president bush appealed to iran for 
help in freeing the hostages and promised a reciprocal gesture of 
good will if iran was receptive to the idea 
since then however the two sides have disagreed on which one 
should take the first step 
redmans comments monday were touched off by remarks by irans 
deputy foreign minister for european and american affairs mohammad 
javad larijani who called on the united states to show good will by 
making some unilateral gestures 
specifically larijani said the united states should pay at least 
token compensation to families of the 290 people mostly iranians 
who died when a us navy vessel shot down an iranian airliner last 
july over the persian gulf 
redman said that the united states remains committed to 
compensation but that iran has not responded to us requests for 
information about the families he said information is needed to 
help us officials decide on compensation levels and methods of 
distributing the funds 
larijani also said the united states could show good will by 
releasing undisputed funds tied up in litigation in the 
usiran claims tribunal at the hague redman denied that there are 
any undisputed funds being discussed in that forum 
as an example redman cited a tribunal decision concerning 
military property owned by iran but held by the united states he 
noted that the tribunal decided that the united states was not 
obligated to return the property but to pay its value as of march 
1981 
we are currently trying to determine the value for the 
thousands of items involved iran and the united states will each be 
filing its position on value to the tribunal in due course its a 
complicated matter and its not undisputed he said 
the tribunal was set up in 1981 as part of the settlement that 
led to the release of the 52 american hostages in iran it is 
designed to resolve financial and property claims the two countries 
have against each other

britains defense secretary said monday it will 
withdraw all or most of an infantry battalion stationed in 
gibraltar nearly halving the colonys garrison 
reducing the garrison likely will raise fears among the 30000 
residents that britain may give up the disputed colony over which 
spain claims sovereignty 
as part of the continuing drive for cost effectiveness we are 
considering restructuring and rationalizing our forces in gibraltar 
and their supporting infrastructure defense secretary george 
younger said in a written statement in the house of commons 
subject to the outcome of detailed studies we plan to withdraw 
in due course all or the major part of the infantry battalion 
stationed there he said 
youngers brief statement did not say when the battalion will be 
withdrawn from the colony at the southern tip of spain 
the announcement came as british foreign secretary sir geoffrey 
howe began a 24hour visit to the colony a giant rock which britain 
used until recently as a military fortress at the strategic strait 
of gibraltar guarding the entrance to the mediterranean sea 
now it is used for troop training and munition stores 
british officials say the garrison is an unnecessary defense 
against spain a fellow member of the 16nation nato alliance 
the gibraltar garrison consists of 781 soldiers and support 
troops 529 naval personnel and 387 air force members 
it generates about 72 million a year for the local economy 
about half the gibraltar administrations annual budget 
spains leading daily el pais said monday that gibraltar chief 
minister joe bossano may press howe for compensation for the loss of 
1700 jobs held by gibraltarians who work for the british defense 
ministry 
during his visit howe was expected to urge bossano to approve an 
agreement giving spain access to gibraltar airport located on land 
between the 225 square mile rock and the spanish mainland bossano 
opposes the agreement 
earlier spanish foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez 
said a british troop reduction in gibraltar would be significant 
but really doesnt affect the status of gibraltar as a british 
colony 
since britain and spain signed an agreement in 1984 to discuss 
the colonys future and sovereignty officials have met periodically 
in london and madrid 
spain ceded gibraltar to britain in 1713 at the end of the war of 
spanish succession

observers in congress universities and public 
interest groups questioned the fairness and wisdom monday of giving 
big pay raises to dozens of senior federal judges who like former 
chief justice warren e burger do no legal work 
all 306 senior federal judges even those who no longer wield a 
gavel will see their salaries rise by about 50 percent unless 
congress disapproves raises due for top federal officials feb 8 
burgers salary for example will increase by 60000 to 
175000 a year 
we need to look into this much further said rep carlos 
moorhead who last year sidetracked an effort to lower the 
eligibility age for senior status 
it doesnt seem fair said the california republican who 
sits on the house courts subcommittee and is a member of a national 
commission studying the future of the federal judiciary 
moorhead said the commission might look at the issue and 
congress may want to study establishing some minimum work to 
qualify for the raises 
david keating of the 150000member national taxpayers union a 
public interest group that promotes tax and spending reduction 
decried giving more money to all senior judges 
its appalling that theyre getting huge salaries for doing 
nothing and now are receiving substantial pay raises for continuing 
to do nothing keating said there ought to be some minimum 
standard of work to qualify for any pay raise 
older federal judges who opt for senior status qualify for 
activeduty pay raises even after stepping down from fulltime duty 
when he retired as chief justice in 1986 burgers salary was 
108400 he chose senior status and in 1987 his judicial salary 
rose to 115000 when his successors pay rose to that level 
burger who is working fulltime as the unpaid chairman of the 
anniversary celebration of the constitution declined to discuss his 
pay increase other than to say im too busy to sit 
judges who retire through resignation the other option provided 
by congress keep for life the same salary they received on their 
last day of work 
senior status is available to any judge who is at least 65 with 
15 years experience or 70 with 10 years 
administrative records obtained by the associated press indicate 
that roughly one in five of the nations senior judges do no 
judicial work whatsoever only 13 former judges have passed up 
senior status to choose full retirement 
the law allows senior judges to turn down any work they dont 
want 
robert raven a san francisco lawyer and president of the 
american bar association emphasized that senior judges as a whole 
do so much for the federal judiciary but said a senior judge 
receiving pay raises for no work is a little disturbing in any one 
instance 
lloyd cutler a prominent washington attorney who chaired the 
commission that recommended the pay raises said this pay system was 
intended by congress and will have little impact on the giant 
federal deficit 
but cutler added you may have a point that if they dont work 
they shouldnt receive more than retired judges i hadnt thought 
about that before 
monroe freedman a legal ethics professor at hofstra university 
said it doesnt look good when judges appear to be taking 
advantage of the law but it may well be too much to ask of people 
who consider themselves having been underpaid for so long to pass up 
senior status 
another legal ethics professor stephen gillers of new york 
university said he saw no ethical problem for the nonworking 
senior judges but it may be the statute should be changed it may 
be unwise or bad management its a question whether the public is 
getting its moneys worth 
congress created the senior judge category in 1919 to open jobs 
for younger appointees by luring older judges out of the lifetime 
appointments the constitution grants them 
congress counted on the senior judges to help with rising 
workloads and in large measure they have 
as a group senior judges handle between 10 and 15 percent of all 
federal cases the federal judiciary would be a mess without 
their help said frank coffin an appeals court judge from 
portland maine 
for those senior judges who do not work reasons can differ 
dramatically 
james noel jr a senior judge in houston performed his last 
judicial duty in 1978 when his annual salary was 54500 80500 a 
year less than he stands to begin receiving next month 
noel 79 took senior status in 1976 when he was 66 after 15 
years as a federal trial judge asked why he chose senior status and 
not resignation noel said it was just a matter of choice 
noel regularly uses his downtown office to manage his extensive 
investments asked about his impending pay raise noel told ap 
i was expecting it 
owen cox a federal trial judge in texas since 1970 took senior 
status in 1981 and did substantial judicial work until his health 
failed 
hes been hospitalized for three years hes on a lifesupport 
system court clerk jesse clark said 
coxs salary would rise to 135000 next month had he resigned 
his salary would have been frozen at 67100

funds we do have work for us said mrs dole who was 
transportation secretary in the reagan administration 
she said she was committed to a goal of advancing from the 
promise of full employment to the promise of fulfilling employment 
it was bushs first public appearance as he began the second week 
of his presidency and it was clear he still had the cold that 
plagued him since the middle of last week 
pardon my voice a hoarse bush told his audience white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush was feeling better after 
a day of rest on sunday but was still taking decongestant

front with civilian unemployment currently at its lowest level in 
14 years 53 percent in december 
therell be jobs in abundance but well have to make sure our 
workers have the skills that they need to fill those jobs with 
excellence bush added 
bush also stressed the theme of volunteerism in a meeting with 
officials from the new white house office of national service 
headed by gregg petersmeyer the concept of one american helping 
another is a valid concept bush said 
he said his administration would be sensitized to how we all 
feel about this im convinced we can do great things

marine guards lowered the flag for the 
last time monday and the us embassy staff prepared to depart 
before the red army leaves kabuls fate to afghan soldiers and 
moslem guerrillas who wait in the hills 
as we say goodbye we say god bless the united states 
said charge daffaires jon d glassman the ranking american 
diplomat still in kabul at the solemn ceremony 
today we leave at a moment that is both happy and sad pleased 
that the people of afghanistan are going to be relieved of their 
suffering but we know their struggle is not over 
the people of the united states are with them glassman said 
raising the folded flag above his head in a salute we will be 
back when the conflict is over 
soviet soldiers entered afghanistans civil war nine years ago 
and are to be gone by feb 15 under a unmediated agreement 
moslem insurgents who get most of their support from the united 
states and pakistan were not parties to the agreement and predict 
victory soon after the red army is gone 
efforts for a political settlement continued president najib 
wrote an open letter published by the englishlanguage kabul times 
that urged the insurgents to negotiate the guerrillas rejected the 
offer the paper said as they have previous government and soviet 
proposals 
yuri maslyukov soviet deputy premier arrived to meet with najib 
just after soviet defense minister dmitri yazov ended a threeday 
visit to kabul a western diplomat in islamabad pakistan said the 
visits were meant to boost the sagging morale of the communist 
government 
embassy officials would not say when the american staff of two 
diplomats four marine guards and five others would leave on a 
chartered flight to new delhi india the kabul airport was closed 
monday by a threeinch snowfall 
the state department said last week the embassy would be closed 
because of fears that afghanistans conscript army could not protect 
foreign diplomats after the soviets leave 
the building is in the heart of kabul near the presidential 
palace the state radio and secret police headquarters all of which 
would be prime guerrilla targets in a battle for the city 
the departure of the embassy staff will leave 10 americans in 
afghanistan all missionaries 
west germany was the first country to withdraw its diplomats 
after the us closure was announced britain france japan and 
austria followed suit 
britain held its farewell ceremony monday and the other three are 
expected to close their missions this week along with italy 
the soviet embassy has said it will continue operating after the 
military withdrawal but with a greatly reduced staff some of the 
kremlins east european allies have indicated they may leave 
india is evacuating relatives of embassy staff but says it wont 
close its mission 
in washington rep stephen solarz chairman of the house 
subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs said the decision to 
close the us embassy was entirely justifiable because of the 
potential danger 
in the long run us influence in afghanistan is likely to be 
limited but i do believe the support we provided to the freedom 
fighters guerrillas will surely be remembered by the people of 
that country the new york democrat said 
najibs government accused the united states of closing the 
embassy as a means of inciting the guerrillas to more intense 
warfare after the red army departs 
moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 soviet soldiers arrived in december 1979 and totaled an 
estimated 115000 when the withdrawal began may 15 half were gone 
by aug 15 
although the rest have until feb 15 to leave the final soviet 
convoy is expected to head north later this week on the salang 
highway the 250mile route through the rugged hindu kush mountain 
range to the soviet burder 
guerrillas control the countryside and are camped in the hills 
around kabul they have attacked food and fuel convoys trying to 
reach the city on the salang and periodically fire rockets into the 
capital 
kabul has suffered severe shortages long lines form at bread 
stores and gasoline stations people in ragged shawls and sandals 
wait for hours in the snow and bitter cold 
an emergency soviet airlift was started jan 21 to bring in flour 
and fuel 
moscow also has said it will give the afghan army military aid 
after the withdrawal because of continuing us and pakistani 
asistance to the rebels 
four soviet tanks rumbled past only momemts before the closing 
ceremony was conducted in the us embassy compound behind walls 
seven feet high and toped with coils of barbed wire 
marine guards brought down the stars and stripes gently folded 
the flag and handed it to glassman who walked to a small slab of 
marble on the other side of the compound that honors adolph dubs 
the former us ambassador 
dubs was kidnapped then killed along with his abductors when 
soldiers tried to rescue him feb 14 1979 us officials still do 
not know the motive 
his mortal remains lie in arlington national cemetery but his 
spirit is here with us in kabul glassman said

oliver norths irancontra trial will begin 
tuesday with president bush free of a subpoena seeking his testimony 
but with former president reagan still subject to call the 
judge in the case said monday 
portions of reagans diary also might be required as evidence 
us district judge gerhard gesell ruled however he rejected 
norths subpoena seeking bushs testimony in the trial in which 
north faces 12 criminal charges 
when north who was indicted last march walks into the us 
courthouse near the foot of capitol hill he will become the first 
figure in the irancontra affair to stand trial 
many of the same witnesses who testified in the nationally 
televised congressional hearings two years ago are expected to be 
called by the prosecutors including former attorney general edwin 
meese iii and norths secretary fawn hall 
at norths side will be brendan sullivan an aggressive 
washington lawyer who also represented north before the 
congressional panels investigating the irancontra affair 
at a hearing friday the government had sought to quash norths 
subpoenas seeking testimony from both reagan and bush as well as 
records from reagan 
gesell said norths lawyers have made no showing that president 
bush has any specific information relevant and material to the 
charges of the indictment which makes it necessary or appropriate to 
require his appearance 
but president reagan shall remain subject to call on the 
subpoena served on him by north in december gesell said in a 
threepage order 
the judge said reagan wouldnt be called as a witness unless 
and until the court issues another order after giving the justice 
department and reagans lawyers an opportunity to list their 
objections at a hearing 
gesell quashed norths subpoena for reagans diary except for 
what he described as a narrow exception 
the judge said the diary subpoena would be subject to renewal 
if norths lawyers support a claim that president reagan ordered 
directed requested or with advance knowledge condoned any of 
norths alleged false statements documentremoval or destruction 
or other alleged crimes in the affair 
in congressional testimony in 1987 north said he had 
authorization from higherups in the administration for all of his 
actions 
gesell said monday that if north can support a claim of 
presidential authorization for his actions consideration must 
then be given to develop an appropriate production procedure for 
determining whether or not any aspect of such a claim finds support 
in the diary and to the need to seek supplementing testimony from 
president reagan through written questions and answers or other 
means 
unless north can do better than his broad request for information 
from the diary gesell said president reagans knowledge would 
generally speaking be irrelevant and immaterial in the light of the 
limited precise counts that still remain in the case 
gesell said reagan has cooperated with independent counsel 
lawrence walsh and been responsive to requests for documents he 
remains willing to assist 
lawyers from walshs office were permitted to review typewritten 
excerpts from reagans diary a year ago it was disclosed at a 
hearing friday 
north is accused of concealing from congress in 1985 and 1986 his 
efforts on behalf of the nicaraguan contras and of falsely telling 
thenattorney general meese that the national security council had 
no role in diverting money from the iran arms sales to the contras 
the former marine and white house aide also is accused of 
illegally accepting a 13800 security system at his home from 
codefendant richard secord converting to his own use at least 
4300 in travelers checks from contra leader adolfo calero and 
conspiring to defraud the treasury of tax revenue in connection with 
charitable contributions supporting the contras 
gesell on jan 13 dismissed the two central charges against 
north conspiracy and theft counts accusing him of illegally 
diverting more than 14 million in us iran arms sale proceeds to 
the nicaraguan rebels 
those charges were dismissed after a panel of intelligence 
experts in the reagan administration citing national security 
concerns refused to declassify many portions of classified 
documents that were deemed necessary for the prosecution or defense 
north was indicted last march along with former national security 
adviser john poindexter and arms suppliers secord and albert hakim 
in june gesell ordered separate trials for them

nearly onefifth of the nations gas stations 
may be forced out of business as a result of new environmental 
safety rules an industry group said monday 
the petroleum marketers association of america said the closures 
probably would not put a squeeze on gas supplies but would 
particularly in rural areas force up prices and make motorists 
drive farther to fill up and get car repairs 
the group representing fuel wholesalers who also own gas 
stations said a survey of its membership indicated that at least 
26250 outlets are being closed or will be closed as a direct result 
of the environmental protection agency rules it said more than half 
of those are in populations centers of 10000 and less 
there are about 150000 retail gasoline outlets in the united 
states the group said 
the regulations at issue require owners of underground petroleum 
storage tanks such as those at retail gas outlets to prove 
through pollution liability insurance or other means that they can 
pay damages in the event their tanks leak 
the epa rules also set stricter technical standards for new and 
existing storage tanks but it is the financial responsiblity rules 
that the marketers group says will force stations to close it said 
the biggest problem for the station owners is that pollution 
liability insurance either is too expensive or is not available 
the problem can be summed up in one word insurance or more 
specifically the lack of it said phillip r chisholm the 
groups executive vice president 
an epa official responding to the marketers complaint said the 
agency agreed that the tank owners face a problem but that adequate 
solutions could be found 
ron brand director of the agencys underground storage tank 
program said insurance was likely to become more available and 
affordable as an increasing number of state governments set up trust 
funds to help pay for pollution cleanup he said 25 states already 
have set up such funds or are arranging to do so 
brand said there was no reliable estimate of the extent of 
environmental harm caused by leaks in the 2 million underground oil 
and gasoline storage tanks nationwide 
the petroleum marketers group said it projected at least 26250 
gas station closings on the basis of survey responses last november 
from 2128 members in 35 states it called the projection 
conservative and said the figure could go as high as 35000 
those totals are only for independent marketers which are 
defined as wholesalers who distribute gasoline and other petroleum 
products to retail outlets often including stations they own 
outright they own about onethird of all gas stations 
the survey results did not include possible closings by retail 
gas dealers who buy directly from oil refiners nor those of 
stations owned by refiners chisholm said some of these stations 
might also be closed as a result of the epa regulations

vice president dan quayle told religious 
broadcasters monday that the soviet government system rooted in 
hatred of god has brought much evil into the world 
he quoted communist revolution leader vladimir lenin as saying 
the idea of god is unutterable vileness of the most dangerous 
kind 
that was lenin and unfortunately his gospel is still actively 
pursued in the soviet union quayle said 
he also said that if moscows planned international human rights 
conference occurs the united states must ensure that it is not 
just a public relations extravaganza for the soviet leadership 
we must insist that all the agreedupon conditions for such a 
conference are met conditions such as free contact of soviet 
citizens with delegates and visitors and that all scheduled 
meetings take place in conditions of unimpeded access and openness 
quayle made his comments in a speech to the annual conference of 
the national religious broadcasters 
president bush has said he would follow through on former 
president reagans agreement for us participation in the 
conference but also has said that soviet human rights performance 
will be monitored in the meantime 
quayle quoted bushs campaign comment that the iron curtain 
separating the east and west still exists but that it is beginning 
to rust 
then the vice president went on to attack the soviet system 
saying that soviet citizens are now speaking out against the 
concentration of power by the communist party 
how did the communist party gain such appalling confidence in 
its own wisdom indeed its own omniscience i think the root of the 
matter all comes back to a hatred of god to a rejection of the 
entire concept of a religious system quayle said 
he contrasted the soviet and american revolutions saying that 
founders of the united states had a belief in the existence of a 
creator whose laws have placed irrevocable limits on the power of 
the state 
look how much good has come into the world as a result of the 
first revolution and how much evil has entered the world because of 
the second quayle said 
his comments in language and tone differed from those bush has 
made recently about the soviets however bush has urged a cautious 
approach to ussoviet relations which seemed to be rapidly 
improving as reagans term came to an end 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said quayles 
comments were not inconsistent with administration policy 
quayle also mentioned his upcoming threeday trip to venezuela 
and el salvador 
my message will be democracy democracy and more democracy 
he said 
he will attend thursdays inauguration of venezuelas new 
president carlos andres perez where he will be in the company of 
some twodozen heads of state and will confer with some 
the el salvador stop on the way back friday will be focused on 
emphasizing human rights officials said elections are scheduled in

cutting back on fertilizer and killer chemicals 
to take care of bugs and weeds isnt a step backward at all and may 
be the start of a long future journey for american farmers an 
agriculture department conference was told monday 
will erwin an indiana farmer and member of the federal farm 
credit assistance board said that socalled lowinput sustainable 
agriculture called lisa by advocates does not mean returning to 
the era of horse power and manual labor on the farm 
we cannot look back we cannot look at it as going back 
erwin told the conference 
but there are some good reasons economic and environmental 
why farmers can and should trim back on some of the the items they 
use such as fertilizer and pesticides and the manner in which 
those items are used 
farmers are only 2 percent of the population erwin said i 
think one of the base problems we have as farmers is that we still 
think we are the powerful farm bloc subconsiously we want to 
believe that we dont have that kind of clout anymore 
erwin said farmers also are perceived as being carried by the 
federal government through various programs and subsidies 
there is a growing force in our society that says to farmers 
that we paid you not to produce while you used chemicals and 
fertilizer to produce more and more and we want lower cost 
programs and a safer ennvironment he said 
the concept of lowinput sustainable agriculture has been around 
for a long time it has grown since the energy crunch of the 1970s 
and as environmental issues such as soil and water pollution have 
taken a deeper hold 
congress in the 1985 farm law authorized usda to conduct research 
and education programs in alternative farming systems often 
referred to as lowinput or sustainable agriculture in 1987 
congress appropriated 39 million to push the lisa concept 
the twoday conference at the department attracted about 150 
registrants to hear farmers and other talk about their experiences 
with lowinput production methods more than 100 of those registered 
represented special interest groups usda agencies and other federal 
offices 
vivan jennings deputy administrator of the extension service 
called lisa an issue whose time has come but cautioned that no 
one should expect miracles 
we should recognize its not a panacea jennings said its 
not going to solve all of our problems and we need to remember that 
as we move ahead 
luther berntson a north dakota farmer who uses the lowinput 
approach for years on his 2000acre operation said that federal 
farm programs helped put production agriculture into a rut 
i dont need to remind you that the government farm programs of 
the past have not rewarded the best management practices he said

a coalition of michigan advertisers and 
newspaper readers said monday it will ask a federal appeals court to 
reconsider a threejudge panels decision to allow a partial merger 
of detroits major daily newspapers 
michigan citizens for an independent press will ask the us 
court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit to block the 
merger of the detroit news and the detroit free press until all 13 
judges can rehear the appeal said attorneys for the organization 
the three appeals judges in an opinion issued friday said the 
newspapers qualified for a partial exemption from federal antitrust 
laws and could implement the proposed joint operating agreement 
william schultz one of the coalitions attorneys said the 
500member organization would argue that this is a case of 
exceptional importance that deserves a hearing by the full appeals 
court he said the panels decision puts newspaper competition in 26 
other cities in jeopardy 
if the decision is allowed to stand any corporation with a 
deep pocket can go in there and cut prices forcing financial 
losses and setting up the conditions necessary to apply for a joint 
operating agreement schultz said 
the news owned by gannett co inc and the free press owned by 
knightridder inc have said they will merge their business and 
production operations beginning feb 6 knightridder had said it 
would close the free press if the partial merger were disapproved 
both the news and the free press have reported heavy losses over the 
past few years 
there was no immediate comment monday from gannett knightridder 
or the news 
free press publisher david lawrence said the papers would go 
ahead with the joa unless another stay is issued by the court 
after almost three years its time for our lives to go 
ahead he said every issue has been heard fair is fair 
and we need to proceed 
the agreement approved last year by the justice department but 
stalled by the appeal allows the newspapers to combine advertising 
circulation production and other business operations to cut costs 
their news and editorial departments would remain separate as 
required by the newspaper preservation act a law intended to 
preserve competing editorial voices when one of the newspapers is in 
danger of financial failure 
the newspapers have announced their intent to raise newsstand 
prices should the agreement go into affect and also have said they 
expect advertising rates would rise under a partial merger

amnesty international on monday called for 
international pressure on iran to halt torture and political 
executions which the human rights group says have totaled more than 
1000 since july 
the londonbased group also expressed concern about irans 
antidrug crackdown in which at least 113 people convicted of 
trafficking or possession have been shot or hanged since the first 
of the year 
amnesty submitted the information in a statement to the un 
human rights commission which began its annual meeting monday in 
geneva 
amnesty international said other human rights violations that 
have persisted in iran include detention without trial and 
amputation usually of the four fingers of the right hand of which 
it said 21 instances ofhad been recorded 
the organization said the amputations were judicial punishment 
for repeated theft 
the group also said it was concerned about a massive antidrug 
crackdown and said about people were unfairly convicted 
tehran radio reported sunday that 22 more drug smugglers were 
hanged publicly in various iranian cities in the previous three 
days raising the total to 113 in the crackdown launched two weeks 
ago 
amnesty international urges the international community to use 
whatever channels are available to persuade the iranian government 
to put an end to the present wave of public executions and to 
implement and observe judicial and other procedures to safeguard the 
human rights of its citizens the group said in its statement 
since the end of july 1988 amnesty international has recorded 
over 1000 names of political prisoners who have reportedly been 
executed it said and further reports are still being 
received 
the group said it expected a prisoner amnesty for the 10th 
anniversary of the founding of the islamic republic in february but 
that any positive impact of such a move would be muted because 
hundreds if not thousands of prisoners will be killed before the 
amnesty comes into effect 
revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini has pardoned 
4500 convicts imprisoned in the northeastern province of khorasan 
and plans to start releasing them tuesday when celebrations begin 
the official islamic republic news agency has said 
amnesty said it appealed to iran on behalf of hundreds of 
prisoners at risk and asked for comment on reported victims but it 
received no responses 
the wave of executions apparently was sparked by an incursion 
into western iran from iraq by the national liberation army a group 
backed by the opposition group peoples mujahedeen organization of 
iran amnesty said 
many victims were from that group and other opposition parties 
and groups involved in armed opposition to the government the 
statement said 
many were imprisoned for years before they were shot to death or 
hanged and among them there were a large number of prisoners of 
conscience and others serving prison terms imposed after unfair 
trials for their nonviolent political activity the statement 
said 
it said more people connected with opposition groups were being 
reported detained without charge young people were being singled 
out for random searches on the street by revolutionary guards and 
floggings remain common

the chairman of the senate commerce committee 
on monday rejected a private groups request to delay the 
confirmation vote on commerce secretarydesignate robert mosbacher 
until more is known about his campaign fundraising for george bush 
sen ernest f hollings dsc sent a letter to the group 
common cause saying action on mosbachers nomination would not be 
postponed because it would be wrong to raise sand over conduct 
that was allowed under federal election law 
the committee is scheduled to vote tuesday on mosbachers 
nomination 
common cause said the vote should be postponed because the 
republican national committee has yet to release a full and accurate 
list of the individuals and corporations that donated at least 
100000 each to the team 100 fundraising drive led by 
mosbacher who was bushs chief fundraiser 
the republican national committee released a list of individuals 
who had made contributions but said much of the money was given on 
behalf of corporations which were not identified 
in a letter to hollings common cause president fred wertheimer 
said the information about corporate donors was needed to allow 
the public to be able to identify any possible connections that 
might arise between the softmoney contributions and any direct 
interest the contributors may end up having in issues before the 
commerce department under mr mosbachers leadership 
hollings said that while he would not postpone action on the 
nomination he planned to introduce legislation to limit spending in 
federal elections

the navy on monday began the administrative 
process required to fire a marine corps purchasing official who 
pleaded guilty last week to bribery charges in connection with a 
pentagon fraud investigation 
jack sherman the marine corps executive was served with a 
written notice advising him of the governments decision to 
terminate his federal employment the service said in a brief 
statement 
federal personnel regulations require that employees proposed 
for removal based on a criminal conviction or guilty plea be 
provided written notice and at least seven days in which to comment 
before final action is taken 
the 52yearold sherman appeared in federal court jan 27 and 
pleaded guilty to accepting bribes in exchange for providing 
confidential contract information to consultants and companies 
he could face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of as much as 
500000 when sentenced april 7 
sherman until identified in court papers last summer in 
connection with the probe worked as a contracting officer in the 
corps installation and logistics department in washington after 
being identified in federal search warrants he was transferred to 
another administrative job that did not involve the award of 
contracts 
the federal investigation known as operation ill wind has been 
underway for at least two years it focuses on allegations that 
private consultants hired by defense contractors bribed pentagon 
officials to obtain inside information that gave companies an edge 
in securing contracts 
the first indictment in the case was handed down jan 6 naming 
one defense contractor and a handful of individuals in addition 
another company and eight individuals have entered guilty pleas to 
various charges 
sherman before being transferred to new duties had a range of 
contacts with consultants and companies 
for instance prosecutors said last week he received a total of 
43500 between october 1986 and june 1987 from an unnamed 
consultant who was working for the fbi the bureau provided the 
money for the bribes which sherman said he put in a savings account 
and used to build a room on his house 
agents recorded 16 meetings between the consultant and sherman 
prosecutors said 
they did not divulge the names of the consultants or the 
companies that paid sherman but an affadavit released earlier said 
he had links to william parkin a defense consultant who has been 
indicted 
parkin and his associates were seeking to buy and sell 
information about the advanced tactical air command central an 
80million contract sought by a number of defense contractors 
sherman was joined in entering a guilty plea last week by two 
other men with ties to the unisys corp the giant computer maker 
the navy announced monday it had forwarded information about 
those two men to the navy debarment committee and to the defense 
contract audit agency for identification and recovery of any sums 
improperly charged the government under defense contracts 
robert d barrett a former executive at unisys and joseph e 
hill a consultant paid by unisys pleaded guilty to making illegal

the un human rights commission on monday opened

opening speakers at the sixweek session cited encouraging signs

afghanistan and namibia and in ussoviet relations 
jan martenson of sweden un under secretarygeneral for human 
rights said the 43nation meeting takes place at a time of great 
hope and expectation although the world remains plagued by 
daily violations of human rights 
but amnesty international in a statement to the commission on 
monday called for international pressure on iran to stop a wave of 
more than 1000 political executions since july the londonbased 
human rights group also expressed concern about at least 113 
executions this month in irans crackdown on drugs 
the commissions 45th session runs through march 10 and will 
culminate with the annual passing of a package of resolutions 
delegates are to consider its first special report on cuba a 
result of unprecedented pressure by the reagan administration at the 
last two sessions 
the traditional debate on the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip is likely to be sharpened by the 15month palestinian 
uprising about 370 palestinians and 15 israelis have been killed in 
the rebellion 
new reports are also scheduled from special investigators on 
afghanistan iran chile guatemala and el salvador other reports 
will deal with torture summary executions and religious intolerance 
the panel is to vote on two longstanding projects a draft 
convention on the rights of the child and a proposed amendment to 
the international covenant on civil and political rights calling for 
abolition of the death penalty 
restating washingtons position richard williamson us 
assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs 
recently said a crucial test for the commissions credibility is 
whether it decides this year to continue scrutiny of cuba 
he said the cuba report is expected to show that fidel castros 
government does indeed deprive its citizens of most of the basic 
human rights 
but a group of commission envoys who visited cuba last year to 
gather information and testimony from alleged victims of abuse has 
failed so far to agree on a final report 
un officials say the report will be presented by midsession and 
is expected to be less critical of cuba than the united states hoped

a firstofakind handbook designed to promote 
ethnic diversity and defuse racial tensions on campus should be on 
the shelf of every university president in america education 
secretary lauro cavazos said monday 
the 181page book compiled by the private american council on 
education is meant to help colleges and universities bolster their 
minority student and faculty populations at a time when black 
enrollment is stagnating 
this is the first time weve put together a comprehensive 
approach our role is trying to set an agenda said the councils 
president robert atwell many many institutions around the 
country are addressing this problem at the same time others out 
there are really looking for help 
the hardcover book called minorities on campus a handbook for 
enhancing diversity says that the last several years have 
brought a disturbing increase of racially and ethnically motivated 
violence and conflict on campuses across the country 
atwell said the absence of role models instances of outright 
racism and so much indifference among students too young to have 
lived through the civil rights movement combine to create major 
problems on some campuses 
a campus climate can be overtly hostile but the problems are more 
likely to be subtle the handbook says minority students often 
feel marginal conspicuous and isolated from the mainstream of the 
institution it says 
the book says universities should demonstrate a commitment to 
ethnic diversity through hiring practices reward systems and the 
inclusion of minorities in all phases of campus life and it warns 
administrators to pay attention to symbols such as confederate 
flags and fraternity slave auctions that minority students may find 
deeply offensive 
the book says institutions should examine the racial makeup of 
their governing boards faculty senior and midlevel administration 
staffs department chairmen and unit heads professional staff 
support staff and undergraduates 
the book goes on to discuss how to recruit minority students and 
faculty members and how to make campuses more hospitable to minority 
groups 
the book says college presidents must set the tone for their 
campuses and with actions as well as words 
i hope that this document is on the shelf of every university 
president in america today cavazos said at a briefing on the 
book if the leadership doesnt come from the top its not going 
to happen so i would say to my colleagues to college presidents 
pay attention 
the council a private group representing the nations colleges 
and universities released the handbook a week after issuing a 
report citing a substantial drop in black male enrollment and 
continued slim representation of other minority groups among 
students teachers and administrators 
the best way to assure minority students success is to build a 
critical mass of minorities on campus of about 30 percent 
enrollment the book says it acknowledges that is not a realistic 
goal for most institutions but offers suggestions to bolster the 
minority presence on campus among them 
develop a recruiting plan that reaches to the elementary school 
level and views adults as prospective students as well 
consider grades community service leadership record essays 
and interviews in addition to test scores as part of the admissions 
process 
help minority students apply for admission and financial aid 
provide more workstudy programs and fewer loans to minority 
students and offer budget counseling and emergency loan services to 
needy students 
in the past decade the balance of student financial aid has 
shifted from mostly grants to mostly loans with grants now 
accounting for about 40 percent of federally sponsored aid as 
opposed to 83 percent 10 years ago according to the organization 
cavazos has said he wants to reverse the trend but cautioned monday 
that youre not going to turn around that issue overnight with the 
budget restraints we face we have to be realistic 
overall college enrollment increased from 11 million to 125 
million from 1976 to 1986 but black male enrollment dropped by 
34000 students from a 43 percent share to a 35 percent share

the nation may face an electricity shortage in 
the 1990s unless power companies build more new generating capacity 
than currently planned a trade group said monday 
based on conservative projections of growth in electricity 
demand the nation will need an additional 50000 megawatts of 
generating capacity by 1997 in order to avoid a shortage a newly 
published american gas association study said 
that amount would be needed in addition to the 32500 megawatts 
of capacity currently under construction the study said 
using an assumption of faster electricity demand growth over the 
next decade which the gas group said it considered to be more 
realistic an additional 105000 megawatts of plant capacity would 
be needed to avoid shortages 
the study said 71 percent of capacity additions planned in the 
197988 period were canceled

an autosafety advocacy group and relatives of 
people killed in a new york bridge collapse filed a petition monday 
asking the federal highway administration to reconsider a bridge 
inspection rule they said showed a callous indifference toward 
public safety 
the rule passed last august and affecting some 122000 bridges 
nationwide allows states to inspect bridges every four years 
instead of every two years as previously required and requires 
an underwater inspection every five years 
the federal agency has issued the final rule despite the 
documented inadequacies of state bridge inspection programs covering 
576000 bridges clarence m ditlow iii executive director of the 
center for auto safety said in a letter accompanying the petition 
by the center and relatives of three victims of the 1987 new york 
state thruway bridge collapse 
for example the national transportation safety board which 
opposed the rule identified insufficient state inspection practices 
as a major contributing factor in the deadly collapse of the 
schoharie creek bridge he said 
the span fell into the schoharie creek on april 5 1987 after 
days of rain and flooding four cars and a tractortrailer plunged 
into the water killing 10 people a year later the chairman of the 
national transportation safety board made an urgent call for highway 
bridge inspections noting that 43000 bridges in the united states 
had not been inspected within two years as was then required by the 
federal highway administration 
henry jasney a spokesman for the center for auto safety said 
monday that the highway agency had no data or engineering analyses 
to support changing its bridge inspection rule 
essentially what it does is it pinches pennies and saves some 
money on inspections but at the cost of better safety he said

the security council extended the un 
peacekeeping mandate in lebanon for six more months monday the 
secretarygeneral said israel was allowing inexcusable violence 
against un forces 
the 15member council renewed the un interim force in lebanon 
despite the high cost and israels refusal to leave the border 
security zone it maintains with the aid of the south lebanon 
army a surrogate militia 
council members accepted the recommendations of secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar who recommended last week that the 
operation continue 
his report to the council contained his strongest criticism of 
israel to date in connection wiith unifil 
perez de cuellar cited numerous violent acts against the force 
including the abduction by a proiranian group last february of lt 
col william r higgins a us military observer attached to it 
the secretarygeneral also said no less inexcusable are the 
daily firings close to unifil positions and vehicles 
most are the work of the sla the israeli authorities who 
arm pay train and direct the sla have repeatedly been urged at 
all levels to ensure that this dangerous practice is brought to an 
end 
israeli efforts to curb the sla six months ago lessened the 
danger he said but i regret that the incidence of firings close 
to unifil positions has since risen close to its former level 
unifil was created in march 1978 to confirm the withdrawal of an 
israeli invasion force restore security in south lebanon and help 
the lebanese government regain authority there the force of 5889 
soldiers and other personnel from nine nations costs about 117

conservative politicians said monday they may have 
lost touch with likeminded voters after surprising legislative 
election victories by a tiny ultraright party led by a former nazi 
ss soldier 
chancellor helmut kohl said his governing christian democrats 
would have to take care of conservative voters who defected 
the conservative republican party captured 11 of the west berlin 
legislatures 138 seats in sundays balloting it also will have two 
seats in the federal parliament in bonn after next years national 
elections giving the ultraright its first representation in 
parliament since 1953 
police said more than 10000 people demonstrated in downtown west 
berlin late monday to protest the republicans showing there were 
isolated rock throwing incidents and vandalism but no violence or 
arrests they said 
the republicans guided by former nazi ss soldier franz 
schoenhuber campaigned on a platform of ridding west berlin of 
foreign workers such as turks and giving preferential treatment to 
germans seeking jobs 
foreigners make up more than 10 percent of the citys population 
of 21 million 
west germany also has been the destination of many asylumseekers 
from the third world and the republicans called for sharp limits on 
their numbers 
sundays balloting marked the first time the republican party 
formed in 1983 won elective seats at the state level schoenhuber 
whose party headquarters are in munich did not run 
the leftleaning frankfurter rundschau newspaper called the 
victories frightening west german jewish leader heinz galinksi 
said they were a heavy defeat for democracy 
however greens party leader antje vollmer said the republicans 
good showing is a challenge but it wont kill democracy 
thousands of people chanted kick out the nazis foreigners 
stay in a march through west berlin late sunday in protest of the 
party 
kohl said told reporters in bonn the partys showing was 
worrisome and indicated west germans are increasingly concerned 
about the growing number of foreigners competing for jobs housing 
and social services 
there is an urgent need to discuss these problems and come up 
with better solutions kohl said he also said reasonable 
solutions had to be found for the large number of asylumseekers 
kohl added that christian democrats would not work with the 
republicans the republicans are no partners of ours he said 
eberhard diepgen a christian democrat and mayor of west berlin 
called the elections a bitter loss and said support for the 
ultraright poses a serious challenge for the nations mainstream 
political parties 
some conservative lawmakers said they thought their ranks had 
drifted too far to the left 
theo waigel head of the christian social union told west german 
tv that the christian democrats must pay more attention to the 
nationalconservative spectrum of voters 
juergen todenhoefer a christian democratic member of parliament 
charged that his party had been moving toward the left 
heiner geissler general secretary of the party said the 
strength of the farleft and the ultraright in berlin aided the 
republican showing 
its like a scissors movement similar to what happened in the 
weimar republic that preceded the nazi era he said the 
radicals from the left and the right pick up support and constrict 
the democratic middle 
karl dietrich bracher a prominent west german historian played 
down the comparison with the shortlived weimar republic 
you cannot seriously compare the two he told the associated 
press in an interview in his bonn office we have no economic 
crisis now and the nazi past is itself a control on the growth of 
nationalism 
he said sundays results were a reaction to the left which is 
especially strong in berlin 
the republicans won 75 percent of the vote according to nearly 
complete official returns 
the christian democrats won 38 percent of the vote and 55 seats 
losing 12 seats from the last election four years ago the free 
democrats who ruled in a coalition with the christian democratics 
lost all 12 of their seats by failing to muster the 5 percent of the 
vote necessary for representation 
the social democrats won 37 percent of the vote for 55 seats and 
the leftwing alternative list party won 17 seats with a 12 percent 
showing a gain of two seats 
kohl said the christian democrats planned to form a coalition 
government with the leftofcenter social democrats 
west berlin is a separate state of west germany surrounded by 
east german territory it was formed from western zones of berlin 
occupied by the allied forces in world war ii 
west berlins 22member delegation in the federal parliament can 
vote in committee but has very limited voting rights in full 
sessions

more than 180 haitian refugees crammed aboard a 
sailboat were detained monday after being intercepted eight miles 
off miami authorities said 
the group reportedly included two pregnant women and a child 
said spokesman gary starks 
a tugboat spotted the woodhulled vessel at about 230 pm and 
the coast guard immediately dispatched a patrol boat to meet it 
starks said 
it was not known how large the sailboat was or the condition of 
the haitians aboard the boats are usually handmade and ramshackle 
the vessel was allowed to continue toward shore and immigration 
officials were to interview the people aboard while the board 
remained in international water starks said 
i think clearly it indicates the terrible conditions that still 
exist in haiti socially economically and politically said perry 
rivkind district director of the immigration and naturalization 
service 
a boat with 96 haitians arrived in marathon about a month ago 
and the coast guard has interdicted a massive number of wouldbe 
haitian immigrants closer to their homeland rivkind said 
the coast guard said it intercepted 4712 haitians last year and 
has stopped more than 18000 since the program began in 1981 almost 
all were immediately returned to haiti 
mondays boatload arrived just a day after about 200 haitians 
protested the treatment of their compatriots at the krome avenue 
detention center in southwest dade county nearly 300 haitians are 
being held there pending review of their asylum requests 
the demonstration was sponsored by the haitian organization 
veyeyo the protesters said black refugees were more likely to be 
held for deportation than are white immigrants 
immigration officials have maintained that most haitians entering 
the united states are not eligible for asylum because they are 
seeking economic refuge and not fleeing political persecution 
rivkind said krome is at capacity and it would be difficult to 
place mondays arrivals there 
we could put people there on an emergency basis and 
subsequently move them out he said

the supreme court has decided solidarity 
can be used in a trade union name which has been forbidden since 
the soviet blocs first free union was outlawed in 1982 the 
official news agency pap said monday 
a name of a trade union apart from a name of an enterprise 
branch kind of work or profession may also contain additional 
names such as the word solidarity according to the decision made 
by the supreme court the agency reported 
it was decided that this decision will have the form of a law 
obligatory for all courts 
an appeal of a lowercourt decision that a solidarity committee 
could not be registered at an accounting company in lublin 
southeastern poland was the basis of the ruling the october 1982 
law outlawing solidarity limited the words permissible in a trade 
unions name 
the supreme court said the lublin court based its decision on the 
1982 law and a state council resolution but the justices declared 
such limits have no confirmation in the law the law according 
to the supreme court based on the principle of pluralism allows 
the organization of more than one union at an enterprise 
if there are several trade union organizations at an 
enterprise each of them should have a name which would identify it 
which would be impossible if a name contained only elments defined 
by the state council resolution the court said according to the 
pap report 
rzeczpospolita the government daily said the court made its 
ruling on saturday 
lech walesa founded solidarity during the strikes of august 1980 
it was suppressed after the martial law was declared in december 
1981 then outlawed 
in a policy reversal jan 18 the communist party central 
committee said more than one union would be allowed in an 
enterprise opening the way for solidarity to be made legal again

a government study of debtfinanced corporate 
takeovers involving loans from 16 large banks found that most of the 
loans were being repaid as anticipated the comptroller of the 
currency said monday 
comptroller robert l clarke in a speech at a meeting of the 
association of reserve city bankers in washington said the study 
was begun last spring to examine how banks handle buyouts and other 
highly leveraged transactions 
in a preview of the studys results clarke said bank examiners 
found that most of the banks had special units to analyze and 
package the loans but did not have separate policies for approval of 
highly leveraged transactions 
he said most of the banks surveyed reported generally 
satisfactory portfolio performance that is to say most of the 
portfolio is performing as anticipated 
the banks also reported reasonable levels of classified and 
problem loans and minimal losses he said 
full results of the study are to be released in february he said 
in a leveraged buyout an investment group borrows heavily to buy 
out stockholders and take over the target company sometimes the 
buyouts are proposed by managers in an effort to thwart hostile 
takeovers 
the companys new owners often either cut costs or sell off 
pieces of the company to pay back loans critics of the practice 
fear that the high debt levels could endanger both the boughtout 
company and the financiers of the transactions 
last month clarke whose office regulates about 4400 of the 
nations 14000 commercial banks ordered his examiners to monitor 
bank involvement in leveraged buyouts more closely he told the 
examiners to make sure banks had policies ensuring that they are not 
too heavily involved in lbos do not lend too much to single 
borrowers and do not lend too much to a single industry

a man awaiting execution on oklahomas 
death row wants to donate his organs and a physician thinks he and 
other condemned criminals should be allowed to do so 
a single condemned criminal can truly recompense society by 
saving the lives of at least five other dying persons said dr 
jack kevorkian every time you execute someone in this country you 
lose two kidneys two lungs and a heart 
the royal oak doctor has quit pathology to devote time to helping 
richard j rojem jr and others like him 
rojem 31 is awaiting execution in the oklahoma state 
penitentiary after his 1985 conviction for the rape and murder of 
his 8yearold stepdaughter the previous year rojem said he wants 
to be an organ donor but prison officials have been slow to act on 
his request 
the convict said he has six more legal appeals in oklahoma before 
his death sentence could become final jerry massie a spokesman for 
the oklahoma department of corrections speculated that the request 
would not be granted for security reasons 
kevorkian is working to change laws to provide for execution by 
irreversible anesthesia a condition that would be similar to 
socalled brain death that method would permit surgeons to take 
organs while they are healthy and transplantable 
organs often are worthless for transplant purposes after death by 
electrocution hanging firing squad or lethal gas he said after 
lethal injection the method of execution in oklahoma only corneas 
and kidneys can be used if they are removed immediately kevorkian 
said 
many doctors say they have reservations about irreversible 
anesthesia because it would directly involve them in an execution 
i want nothing to do with it said dr darrell j campbell 
jr a transplant specialist at the university of michigan medical 
center in ann arbor 
rojems request comes at a time when more than 16000 americans 
need new organs according to the united networks for organ sharing 
in richmond va 
he rojem has the right to make an organ donation said 
henry schwarzschild spokesman for the american civil liberties 
union in new york but it is not an absolute right the state of 
oklahomas position may be that he is free to do so but it doesnt 
have an obligation to provide facilities

the testimony also from police paramedics and hospital workers 
focused on steinbergs comments after lisa was found comatose in his 
manhattan apartment on nov 2 1987 she died three days later 
ms nussbaum testified that steinberg told her he hit lisa he 
could be convicted even if the jury found he did not hit her but 
showed depraved indifference to her life by leaving her 
unconscious on the floor overnight 
steinbergs lawyers contended during the trial that it was ms 
nussbaum who hit the girl and that steinberg 47 did not summon an 
ambulance because he did not realize she was injured 
if it rejects the murder charge the jury could convict steinberg 
of firstdegree manslaughter meaning he meant to hurt lisa but not 
to kill her seconddegree manslaughter meaning he did not mean to 
hurt her but showed reckless disregard for her life or criminally 
negligent homicide 
there was speculation over the weekend when the jury sought 
clarification of terms that are elements of manslaughter that the 
panel had determined steinberg was innocent of the murder charge 
state supreme court justice harold rothwax had told jurors not to 
consider manslaughter unless they unanimously acquitted steinberg of 
seconddegree murder

contra leaders insisted monday that the bush 
administration supports them and strenuously denied the existence 
of a cia probe into their possible misuse of secret political funds 
contra director adolfo calero said the nicaraguan rebels have not 
had official contact with the president or his aides since the 
inauguration but he said he talked informally to defense 
secretarydesignate john tower and republican party chairman lee 
atwater and had received assurances that bush would continue the 
reagan administrations support of the contras 
bush has yet to appoint an assistant secretary of state for latin 
american affairs and has made no initiatives or policy changes on 
aid to the contras since taking office 11 days ago 
the message is that the resistance would not be abandoned 
that the resistance is a reality and is part of any policy that the 
united states would develop calero said 
he angrily denied a los angeles times story that quoted 
unidentified government and contra sources as saying the cia has 
begun an audit into the possible personal use of money it gave the 
antisandinista rebels for political work outside the united states 
the story identified calero as a main target of the audit 
it is false it is defamatory and i am going to proceered

president bush hopes to spell out plans for 
dealing with the savings and loan crisis in his feb 9 address to 
congress but might not be ready with details by then his spokesman 
said monday 
hell address it in his speech im not willing to say how 
specific his speech will be said press secretary marlin fitzwater 
meanwhile treasury secretary nicholas brady met privately monday 
with house speaker jim wright dtexas and other key democrats 
concerning the sampl situation 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee said brady described alternatives being considered 
for coming up with the money experts say it may require as much as 
100 billion to close insolvent savings institutions while 
protecting depositors against losses 
everybodys looking for the path of least resistence 
rostenkowski said adding that brady told the group meeting in 
wrights office that bush has not made up his mind 
but rostenkowski said the plan that brady floated as one option 
last week on capitol hill to levy an insurance fee on depositors 
is as flat as a pancake 
one alternative could be to raise the premiums that banks and 
savings and loan associations now pay for federal insurance 
the healthy institutions wont be for increased premiums 
rostenkowski said theres no solution thats not going to be 
painful 
fitzwater also said bush would continue to seek advice from 
members of congress despite complaints by chief of staff john sununu 
that lawmakers had leaked discussions of a fee on deposits 
consultations are a very important part of the process 
fitzwater said president bush has been reaching out to congress 
in many forms we would expect that to continue 
sununu suggested on abctvs this week with david brinkley on 
sunday that certain members of congress may have violated the 
administrations trust in leaking word that the depositor fee was 
being considered 
that enabled critics of the plan to seize the iniative and put 
the worst foot forward late last week sununu said 
fitzwater said that bush was very concerned about leaks but 
didnt have any particular problems in this instance 
in fact sununu himself discussed the proposed fee as an option 
at a white house briefing last wednesday 
it just happened it was one of the options and so the governor 
discussed it because you asked him i dont blame anybody it just 
happens fitzwater said 
disclosure that the fee was under consideration caused a 
firestorm of protest both on capitol hill and in the banking and 
savings and loan industry 
on monday democrats chided sununu for saying over the weekend 
that the fee plan remains a live option 
rep charles schumer dny a member of the house banking 
committee said he was utterly amazed that the administration 
was standing by the proposal senate banking committee member jim 
sasser dtenn said the idea wont fly but said he was glad 
the bush administration was addressing the nations savings and loan 
problem 
ronald reagan i never heard him utter one word on the crisis 
in the savings and loan industry sasser said 
republicans displayed sympathy toward sununu rep jim leach 
riowa a banking committee member said that by defending the plan 
sununu was merely performing his function of presenting the 
president with all the options 
theres a big difference between having ones feet in concrete 
on a proposal and assessing the options leach said 
another gop banking panel member rep bill mccollum of florida 
also said he expected the plan to not be implemented but added that 
it would be helpful to study all proposals 
the choices are very narrow he said my view is lets look 
it over there might be some constructive way of dealing with it 
the plan would call for a fee of about 250 for each 1000 on 
deposit in a federally insured institution the proceeds would go 
toward the 100 billion that federal regulators say could be needed 
to deal with the nations insolvent savings and loans 
fitzwater said such a fee which some critics say would violate 
bushs nonewtaxes pledge remains an option under consideration 
by the administration 
however he added that other options were also being worked on 
and developed and that no specific plan had yet come to the white 
house for bushs review 
he said the president has been meeting with treasury secretary 
nicholas brady daily 
fitzwater said bush would talk about the savings and loan 
situation in his budget address to a special housesenate session on 
feb 9 
however because of the complexity of the problem the complete 
administration proposal for dealing with the situation may not be 
ready by then fitzwater said

despite empty shelves long lines and grumbling 
consumers president mikhail s gorbachevs drive for efficiency is 
improving the performance of the soviet economy the top government 
statistician said monday 
mikhail korolev chairman of the state committee for statistics 
wrote in pravda that the gross national product is growing and 
production of many food items is increasing 
he said this is proof that gorbachevs campaign for 
perestroika or restructuring is having a positive impact on 
the soviet economy 
but he said the effectiveness of perestroika is difficult to spot 
in the shops because the soviet consumers demand for goods and 
services has grown even faster than production 
despite the increase in the output of consumer goods the 
sharply increased demand has not been met to the full korolev 
wrote in the communist party daily 
he said the soviet gross national product grew 5 percent last 
year and was 133 percent higher than in 1985 the national income 
a soviet measurement of economic performance that excludes some 
services measured under gnp increased in 1988 by 44 percent over 
the 1987 figure korolev wrote 
the government announced this month that soviet gnp in 1988 
totaled 866 billion rubles or 14 trillion that was less than 
half of the 1985 us gnp of 38 trillion 
to show that perestroika has been successful korolev compared 
the average yearly grain harvest during the perestroika years of 
198688 taken as a whole with the average in 198185 
he said the current annual average was up 14 percent over the 
preperestroika period 
last week however a soviet official estimated the 1988 grain 
harvest at 195 million tons down from 210 million tons in 1986 and 
1987 
korolev also said average annual meat production in 198688 was 
16 percent higher than in 198185 he said the yearly average 
production of eggs for the same periods had increased by 11 percent 
and milk by 10 percent 
the official also cited significant increases over the last three 
years in the production of keenly sought consumer goods such as 
televisions radios tape players sewing machines washing 
machines motorcycles and bicycles 
he also said soviets are now earning more 
the monetary incomes of the population grew by 85 percent in 
1988 alone and by 167 percent over the three years of the current 
fiveyear plan period as a whole korolev wrote 
he did not give figures for current average incomes or say 
whether the increases were adjusted to take inflation into account 
in 1988 government figures said the average soviet factory worker 
was earning about 200 rubles a month or about 333 at the official 
exchange rate 
korolev also said soviets were now working more productively 
it is important that the economy has begun to turn toward an 
intensive way of development he wrote higher labor 
productivity has been achieved in all key branches of the economy

government officials acknowledged 
monday that a west german company shipped a toxic chemical to iraq 
but they disputed a report that the amount was enough to make 
biological weapons 
another west german company confirmed it shipped materials to 
india that could be used for nuclear purposes but it said the 
delivery was approved by the federal government 
west german officials also said they are looking into us 
allegations iran used its embassy in bonn to arrange shipments of 
supplies for the production of poison gas 
we are examining this matter but we have no official 
indications that the allegations are true a government official 
said on condition of anonymity before we do anything we must 
have something in our hands 
there has been a flurry of allegations in recent weeks that west 
german companies were involved in illegal exports that could be used 
to produce chemical biological and atomic weapons 
some american congressmen say west german leaders looked the 
other way while such shipments were made an accusation the federal 
government angrily denies 
der spiegel magazine reported the frankfurtbased degussa company 
shipped 210 pounds of beryllium to india in 1984 which the magazine 
said could be used in nuclear weapons 
the company in a statement said the indian government provided 
them with detailed accounts of where the material would go and for 
what purpose it would be used and that it was not for military 
purposes 
dieter vogel a spokesman for the federal economics ministry 
said the government export permits were issued because india agreed 
to provide documentation on the use of the materials 
beryllium a metal can be used to intensify nuclear explosions 
in another recent article der spiegel reported iraq is 
developing biological weapons with german assistance 
the magazine said the bavarian company sigma chemie delivered 
more than 200 milligrams of the toxic substance mykotoxin to iraq in 
1987 even though the federal government in bonn knew it can be used 
to make biological weapons 
friedhelm ost the chief government spokesman in bonn 
acknowledged mykotoxin derived from poisonous mushrooms was sent 
to iraq but said the amount can only be used for scientific and 
laboratory purposes 
in baltimore a us attorney said monday a chemical weapons 
component manufactured by a baltimore company wound up in iran 
reports say such shipments were arranged through the iranian embassy 
in bonn 
breckinridge l wilcox the us attorney for maryland said 
alcolac inc of baltimore agreed to plead guilty to one count of 
knowing violation of export laws in connection with the export of 
thiodiglycol a substance that when combined with hydrochloric acid 
produces lethal mustard gas 
alcolac officials said the chemicals were sent to the middle east 
without their knowledge willcox said authorities traced one 
shipment of the chemical to iran and suspect four other shipments 
were sent through jordan to iraq 
the new york times said investigators found that a bonnbased 
iranian diplomat directed the west german company chemco gmbh to buy 
the chemicals from alcolac and that the shipments were secretly 
routed through greece and singapore 
the iranian embassy in bonn contacted by telephone referred all 
questions to a spokesman but said he would not be in until tuesday 
officials at chemco gmbh did not respond to messages left on its 
answering machine monday

there is rampant corruption in the bureau of 
indian affairs and among many tribal leaders an indian activist 
told congress on monday 
within the past two years i have personally attempted to 
assist seven indian reservations located in the southwest northwest 
and northern plains with economic development said russell means 
head of the american indian movement 
the investors i represented were from various groups interested 
in establishing banks resorts indianowned public relations firms 
factories fishing ports and international trade 
i know that the tribal governments do not want economic 
development unless graft is a major ingredient said means 
means did not volunteer the names of the seven tribes nor was he 
asked means group has pushed hard for indian rights and has long 
been critical of the bia 
means said both the poorest and the richest reservations suffer 
from mismanagement a bloated patronage system and no checks and 
balances 
he said many tribal officials are honest men and women but a 
vast majority of the tribal officials parasite on the incestuous 
world of tribal politics its embarrassing 
he also contended that there is widespread sexual abuse of 
children on indian reservations but said and all you hear are 
whispers 
in his testimony before a special investigative committee of the 
senate select committee on indian affairs means called for 
abolishment of the bureau of indian affairs and said management of 
the tribes should be the sole responsibility of tribal elders as 
traditional customs dictate 
means was among five indian leaders to appear before the 
committee on its first day of hearings into a wide range of 
allegations of corruption on indian reservations the subcommittee 
will hear later form the bia 
though he was the only one to advocate abolishment of the bia 
the agency came under heavy fire from the others 
wilma mankiller chief of the cherokee nation of oklahoma said 
it was an anachronism which has barely changed since its inception 
despite changes among the tribes 
the bia structure does not support indian efforts funds are 
eaten up by the bureaucracy she said it should be radically 
streamlined 
twila martinkekahbah chief of the turtle mountain band of 
chippewa indians in north dakota said tribes throughout the country 
are at various levels of development and the bia as it now 
operates is not creative enough to help them all 
the hearings expected to last several weeks were prompted by a 
series in the arizona republic newspaper detailing fraud in 
contracting gaming law enforcement on reservations and among 
tribal leadership 
the committee also will examine charges of child sex abuse in 
indian schools and poorquality education on reservations 
the committee staff conducted more than 1000 interviews by 
telephone and in person and received briefings and documents from 
every federal agency that administers indian programs 
the committee also examined more than 900000 pages of documents 
and conducted dozens of depositions 
sen dennis deconcini dariz who chairs the special 
investigative committee said he did not know if the hearings would 
result in restructuring of the bia 
its too early to tell he said but we will be making 
recommendations 
a congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
material gathered by the committee would be turned over to the 
justice department and could be use to seek indictments 
deconcini said he was most troubled by reports of child sexual 
abuse among indians and the use of indians as fronts by companies 
trying to qualify as minority contractors 
he said the panel is still pursuing allegations in the newspaper 
series that billions of dollars in oil royalties were illegally 
diverted 
but deconcini said the dollar amount of the possible diversion 
appears overstated 
later leonard garment a washington attorney who served as a 
consultant on indian affairs to president nixon from 1969 to 1974 
advocated establishment of an indian trust counsel authority as a 
means of assuring adequate legal representation for indians 
in some matters on which the united states government must go 
to court the position adopted by the department of justice does not 
take account of the interests and claims of american indians a 
trust counsel authority would insure that in situations of 
conflict the indians would receive separate us government 
representation in the courts he told the panel 
the establishment of such a position was unsuccessfully advocated 
by nixon while he was in office and in a letter to the committee 
dated jan 26 1989 the former president expressed hope congress 
will reconsider the idea

the newspaper annahar on monday published 
some of the more than 10000 holiday greetings sent to american 
hostages in lebanon the irish ambassador expressed optimism one or 
more hostages may be released soon 
keep hanging in there said one postcard from a student in 
colorado that was among the cards and letters the daily newspaper 
said have arrived at its mailing address in moslem west beirut since 
dec 1 
they are addressed to eight of the nine american hostages held in 
the lebanese capital only edward austin tracy a vermont writer who 
lived in lebanon for many years before his october 1986 kidnapping 
did not receive any messages 
one letter signed by rep donald j pease dohio appeals to the 
captors to provide an address for letters to hostages 
although its not an easy period for you i want you to know 
that you are always in our prayers pease told associated press 
correspondent terry anderson the longestheld of the 15 foreign 
hostages in lebanon anderson was kidnapped march 16 1985 
a letter from teacher joyce suger accompanied postcards sent by 
her students at windsor high school in fort collins colo to 
hostage thomas sutherland 
one of the boys said to me i know at least one card will get 
through and i know it will be one of ours said her letter if 
he can believe in miracles so can i i hope youll be back with 
your family soon 
sutherland whose hometown is fort collins was acting dean of 
agriculture at the american university of beirut when he was 
kidnapped june 9 1985 
most of the hostages are believed held by proiranian shiite 
moslem organizations 
irish ambassador patrick mccabe said monday that after meeting 
with a number of people in beirut he had no hard information 
indicating hostages including brian keenan of ireland will be 
released soon but he declared i have hope 
i think its too early to be less than hopeful mccabe told a 
late night news conference at his hotel in brummana a christian 
mountain resort east of the capital 
nothing i have heard puts me in a position to conclude that the 
rumors of an early release of one or more hostages lack any 
substance said mccabe who added he plans to stay one more week 
in beirut to pursue his efforts 
he declined to identify who he met or where he met them 
mccabe who is irelands ambassador to iraq and lebanon arrived 
from his base in baghdad on saturday in an effort to verify reports 
keenan and possibly british journalist john mccarthy were about to 
be freed 
keenan 38 of belfast an english language teacher at the 
american university of beirut was kidnapped april 11 1986 he also 
holds british citizenship 
mccarthy 32 of london a producer for the londonbased 
worldwide television news agency was abducted six days later as he 
drove to beirut airport to catch a flight to london 
no group has claimed to be holding either man 
he also said he received no hard information on anglican 
church envoy terry waite 
waite 48 disappeared jan 20 1987 after leaving a west beirut 
hotel for an appointment with the captors of anderson and 
sutherland no group has claimed responsibility for his abduction

the district of columbia city council trying 
to stem the citys rising homicide rate on monday proposed making 
handgun manufacturers and sellers liable for injuries and deaths 
caused by those weapons 
sponsors of the legislation said it will be the first of its kind 
in the nation 
the purpose of this legislation is not just to make gun 
manufacturers pay to the limited extent that money can compensate 
for the suffering that their products cause said council chairman 
david clarke the bills original sponsor this legislation is 
designed to force gun manufacturers to consider carefully the 
purposes for which handguns are manufactured 
the plan would hold handgun manufacturers importers and dealers 
liable for damage caused by handguns in the same manner some states 
hold tavern owners or party hosts liable for injuries caused by 
drunken drivers 
the bill is supported by 12 of the 13 council members in a city 
whose officials are worried about a rising murder rate 
january is already the bloodiest month in city history with 49 
killings through monday that grim trend was established in 1988 
when 372 persons were killed in the nations capital the highest 
yearly total ever 
police blame up to 60 percent of the killings on drugrelated 
violence 
clarke said he expects stiff opposition from the national rifle 
association but he predicted that the nra and other progun groups 
will try to block the measure in the house of representatives which 
reviews about legislation from the council 
this is a very stupid idea another in a series of attempts by 
the dc council to divert attention from the citys abysmal record 
in fighting crime said nra assistant general counsel richard 
gardiner its very clear that their intentis to outlaw private 
handgun ownership 
gardiner promised to fight the matter before the city council 
and said it is likely his organization will continue its battle in 
congress 
the district already has a complete ban on handgun purchases and 
prohibits registration of any weapon not purchased before 1976

the rev james alexander forbes jr a black 
clergyman known for his preaching skill has been named to lead 
famed riverside church and its vigorous socialjustice ministry 
the interdenominational church announced the choice monday after 
a yearlong search for a successor to the rev william sloane 
coffin a civil rights and antiwar activist 
the 2200member church built by the late john d rockefeller in 
1930 has had a line of noted pastors beginning with the late harry 
emerson fosdick 
forbes 53 professor of preaching at new yorks union 
theological seminary where he has taught for 12 years was described 
as being a theologian of eloquence and keen social concern 
he is an eminent preacher committed to pluralism inclusivity 
and social justice the key characteristics for our senior 
minister said the head of the search committee j richard butler 
he told the congregation sunday that the committee had concluded 
that forbes was the man to lead this congregation through the next 
decade and into the 21st century 
the selection already approved by the churchs board of deacons 
remains subject to affirmation by members but that is expected to 
be a formality next sunday when they vote to discharge the search 
committee 
the church with a 6 million annual budget has become an 
increasingly ethnically mixed congregation with a diversified 
program of help to the poor and homeless and working for racial 
justice and disarmament 
although jointly affiliated with the american baptist churches 
and the united church of christ the congregation is a composite of 
denominational backgrounds 
coffin stepped down a year ago after a decade of leading the 
church to become president of a disarmament group sanefreeze 
based in washington dc 
for the last year an acting senior minister the rev george 
hill drawn out of retirement in claremont calif had filled the 
pulpit until a successor to coffin was chosen 
forbes prior to joining the seminary faculty had led an 
innovative pastoral training program in washington and previously 
led congregations in richmond va and roxboro nc 
in washington he had been director of interfaith metropolitan 
theological education inc a seminarywithoutwalls for ministry in 
protestant catholic and jewish traditions 
last year he joined in protests in washington and new york 
against south african apartheid and was among several seminary 
professors arrested 
born in burgow nc forbes holds theological degrees from 
colgaterochester divinity school in rochester ny and new yorks 
union seminary and had clinical pastoral training at the medical 
college of virginia 
he was ordained both in the american baptist churches and the 
original united holy church international a black pentecostalist 
body 
forbes says religion has a key role to play in national life 
no government can function without a living vision of what it 
means to be human and religion should keep that vision alive he 
said in a recent interview with the washington post 
he said religion should provide a prophetic critique of 
government and also provide guidelines and principles by which we 
assess the kind of character that leaders ought to have

president daniel ortega on monday 
announced a severe austerity plan for 1989 that nearly cuts the 
federal budget in half restricts credit and slashes capital 
investment in a bid to curb hyperinflation and increase productivity 
i appeal to the sensibility and honesty of all nicaraguans so 
this proposal doesnt turn into a political confrontation ortega 
said at the end of a twohour 40minute speech before the national 
assembly 
otherwise well be paying with the blood and the future of our 
people 
ortega said that if inflation which reached 20000 percent last 
year is not brought under control and production not increased the 
government might implement a war economy policy 
he did not elaborate 
ortega said the budget will be cut by 461 billion cordobas or 
about 44 percent including deep cuts in capital investment and 
government credits to the agricultural and business sector 
consequently staterun banks will provide new loans only to 
those who can pay ortega said he acknowledged that tighter 
credit could prompt dissent from business leaders but he said the 
government has been stimulating private producers regardless of 
their political positions 
the president did not say how many government workers would be 
laid off because of the budget cuts but in a telephone interview 
with the newspaper el nacional in caracas venezuela ortega said 
35000 public employees would be laid off of which 23000 beloing 
to the sandinista army and the interior ministry and 12000 to other 
public institutions 
those laid off will be given monetary help for two months and 
offered agricultural work he said about 10000 workers are needed 
for the coffee harvest he noted 
ortega said the government plans cuts in subsidies for basic 
goods but did not provide details he said urban areas would be hit 
hardest by the cuts and suggested nicaraguan laborers consider 
moving to rural areas to find employment 
ortega also announced that the official and parallel rates of 
currency exchange will be merged into one rate per dollar in an 
effort to eliminate black market demand for dollars he did not say 
what the rate would be 
currently the official rate 2300 cordobas per dollar is used 
to calculate payment for exports and the parallel rate at 4400 
cordobas is used for those selling dollars the dollar now fetches 
about 5500 cordobas on the black market 
the president blamed nicaraguas runaway inflation on the war 
with the usbacked nicaraguan rebels known as contras he said 
the government had to finance its military operations while the 
united states pressured multilateral lending institutions to cut off 
financing to nicaragua 
the united states imposed a trade embargo against nicaragua in 
1985 
ortega told nicaraguans to expect continued hard times and called 
for the cooperation of workers and private business he assured 
landholders that government confiscations of property were a thing 
of the past 
the confiscated land already distributed to the peasants will 
not be returned ortega said on the other hand theres no 
longer reason to take away an inch of land from anybody he said 
about 85 percent of farmland in nicaragua is in private hands 
and only 15 percent is owned by the state he said 
also monday the official sandinista newspaper barricada reported 
that the government and a private sugar company reached a tentative 
agreement to solve a dispute over the confiscation of the companys 
sugar mill last july 
in its lead article barricada cited unidentified government 
sources in reporting that the deal with nicaragua sugar and the 
state sugar corp was worked out over the weekend and included 
realistic compensation to the firm 
the general manager of nicaragua sugar carlos pellas confirmed 
that a tentative agreement was reached with the government the 
opposition newspaper la prensa reported monday 
la prensa reported that pellas declined to reveal details of the 
agreement he did say that returning the sugar mill to its owners 
was not a viable option and that longtime workers would not be 
fired the report said 
repeated attempts by the associated press to reach officials of 
nicaragua sugar by telephone were not successful

communist party chief karoly grosz said 
monday the leadership has not yet decided that the revolt of 1956 
was a popular uprising despite a politburo members weekend 
declaration 
soviet troops put down the revolt its leaders including imre 
nagy premier of the shortlived government were executed in 1958 
imre pozsgay a politburo member and leading reformer said in a 
startling announcement after a weekend meeting of a party committee 
that the events were a popular uprising and not as officially 
termed counterrevolution 
pozsgay said his comments reflected the work of the committee 
which he heads it is reviewing the past 40 years 
the official news agency mti quoted grosz as saying monday i 
do not know what motive led mr pozsgay to formulate this single 
element of the four decades of analysis 
when chosen to head the committee last year pozsgay said it 
should review 40 years thus indicating he favored a review of the 
1956 events grosz appeared to want a shorter period covered 
grosz returning from a trip to switzerland said monday a 
reevaluation of the political consequences of 1956 was the job of 
the party central committee not of one person or a temporary 
committee 
this debate is still to be held he said i believe that 
perhaps mr pozsgay and the committee have documents on which they 
base this statement i have not come across such documents so far 
he said he did not exclude in principle the formulation of 
a new political qualification about 1956 mti reported 
premier miklos nemeth noted in an address monday to the chamber 
of commerce that pozsgays committee had made a partial study 
if there is something that we have to learn from the past it is 
that if we use oneword terms to qualify the always extremely 
complex occurrences or processes of history it is a grave error 
which can lead to more serious ones mti quoted him as saying

joel steinbergs manslaughter conviction monday 
in the death of his illegally adopted daughter wont have any 
positive lasting effect in preventing such cases a leading 
advocate against child abuse said monday 
now that lisas case is over with it will all be business as 
usual said dr vincent fontana children will continue to die 
at the rate of two or three a week in new york city and in another 
10 years well have another milestone case 
steinberg was convicted of firstdegree manslaughter in the death 
of 6yearold lisa fontana chairman of the mayors task force on 
child abuse for more than 20 years said he should have been 
convicted of the more serious charge of seconddegree murder 
its a sad day for the kids who are being abused in this 
country said fontana after learning of the verdict i just feel 
sorry for the kids because all those people who are batterers and 
child murderers will feel this is a signal that because the legal 
system is such you might get away with it 
the child protective system failed her the schools system 
failed her and now the judicial system has failed her he added 
referring to lisa 
fontana said he thought steinbergs longtime livein companion 
hedda nussbaum also should have been prosecuted for lisas death 
charges against ms nussbaum were dropped because the prosecution 
concluded that she was too emotionally and physically battered 
herself allegedly by steinberg to have harmed or helped lisa 
i believe if there are two parents involved theyre both 
guilty one is the passive abuser and one is the active abuser 
he said 
dr samuel klagsbrun ms nussbaums psychiatrist at four winds 
hospital in katonah ny said ms nussbaum was a victim not a 
criminal 
there is a double human tragedy in this story one is the death 
of a child and other is an almost longtime death of a woman 
klagsbrun said 
a week before the verdict was issued klagsbrun had said nussbaum 
would interpret any verdict except murder as they didnt believe 
me 
ms nussbaum testified that she was severely beaten by steinberg 
and said that he told her he hit lisa prosecutors said she was not 
responsible for lisas death but defense lawyers alleged that she 
had attacked lisa in a jealous rage over steinbergs attention for 
the child 
mayor edward i koch who once said that boiling child abusers in 
oil was not punishment enough said of the verdict monday this 
jury has done a remarkable job in sorting out the evidence they 
took a long time but they took whatever time was necessary to do a 
good job to evaluate the evidence against the charges hats off to 
this jury

some of the jurors who convicted joel steinberg 
of manslaughter monday made it clear from the start of deliberations 
they would never convict him of murder the panels foreman said 
steinberg faces from 8 13 to 25 years in prison on the 
firstdegree manslaughter charge but was found innocent of 
seconddegree murder a charge that carries a maximum of 25 years to 
life 
jury foreman jeremiah cole said some of the jurors made it 
clear at the outset that they would never vote for the seconddegree 
murder count 
at a news conference after the verdict was announced cole said 
the jurors often found themselves in heated argument during the 
eight days of deliberations 
the jurors had become so angry at one another that by the time 
they settled on the manslaughter conviction minutes before the 
verdict was announced they asked the court for a few minutes to 
kiss and make up cole said 
the deliberations he said took such a toll on him that its 
impossible for me to remember when anything happened during 
deliberations 
the past week is a blur for me he said 
he said he was among the jurors who did not want to convict 
steinberg of murder 
but he said the threemonth trial had given him a clear picture 
of what happened in that apartment that night and i have that 
picture beyond a reasonable doubt 
sixyearold lisa steinberg the disbarred lawyers illegally 
adopted daughter was found comatose in his manhattan apartment on 
nov 2 1987 she died three days later 
steinberg and hedda nussbaum his longtime livein companion 
were charged in the girls death charges against ms nussbaum were 
dropped after prosecutors determined she was too physically and 
mentally incapacitated to be responsible 
she testified against steinberg for seven days but cole said i 
think its safe to say we put heddas testimony aside 
another juror helena barthell 36 said the jury had virtually 
ignored ms nussbaums testimony mrs barthell said she wanted 
steinberg convicted of murder 
certainly a murder two verdict would have sent a stronger 
message she said 
state supreme court justice harold rothwax instructed the six men 
and six women of the jury that they must consider ms nussbaum an 
accomplice in lisas death as such her testimony had to be 
supported by other evidence in order to secure a murder conviction 
i felt sorry for her but to some extent as an adult as a 
woman she accepted these conditions mrs barthell said 
the juror said she understood the effects of mindcontrol and 
brainwashing on a person but you always kind of hope that some 
spark of instinct would prevail to protect a child 
cole added it was a key question whether hedda deserved 
blame

the navy commander charged monday that 
soviet submarines from secret baltic bases continue to violate 
swedish waters national television reported 
we are approaching situations where there may be action vice 
admiral bengt schuback said in a television interview 
he said experience from several subhunt incidents had improved 
the navys chances of catching intruders and that a trapped 
submarine may try to shoot its way out 
we are prepared for the risk schuback said 
sweden has not officially accused any nation of violations since 
1983 when the government protested soviet sub incursions to moscow 
two years earlier a soviet submarine ran aground outside a naval 
base in southern sweden 
the tv said a report about foreign underwater intrusions in 1988 
due to be presented in two weeks showed that violations continued 
at about the same rate as earlier this decade 
a week ago the navy said it had indications that a submarine 
had penetrated waters outside stockholm 
schuback said there was no firm evidence but that the vessels 
must come from soviet areas of the baltic 
these underwater vessels come from secret bases there is 
no possibility that western countries have such hidden 
basesschuback said 
the swedish defense gradually has reinforced its submarine 
defense since the incident in 1981 but steppedup efforts to catch 
intruders including the use of depth charges and mines so far have 
failed to produce results 
the military has said new weapons experience and adjustment of 
rules to allow for quicker decisionmaking is bringing them closer 
to catching intruders

a federal judge on monday temporarily stayed 
his 2 million bail for a koreanamerican businessman charged in an 
alleged international conspiracy to illegally export nerve gas 
us district judge h lee sarokin said the government failed to 
offer convincing evidence that juhwan yun 48 of short hills would 
flee prosecution but was persuaded to stay his order until noon 
tuesday said one of yuns attorneys jeremy littman 
the delay gives government prosecutors time to consider appealing 
the release order to an appeals court 
nothing is more abhorrent to our free society than the spectre 
of persons accused of crimes being confined in prisons before trial 
and conviction sarokin wrote in an opinion ordering yuns 
release the right to be free on bail before trial is what 
distinguishes our democracy from totalitarian governments 
yun has pleaded innocent to charges of conspiring to violate the 
arms export control act and attempting to ship 500 quarterton bombs 
of sarin a nerve gas the destination may have been iran the 
government said in court papers 
yun has been in custody since his arrest jan 12 
under the bail agreement yun forfeited his passport and those of 
his wife and three children he also must remain in his home and all 
international telephone calls will be monitored by the us 
attorneys office 
assistant us attorney anne singer who is handling the case for 
the government declined to comment 
us magistrate ronald j hedges revoked bail for yun on jan 20 
after prosecutors said classified government documents written in 
english and korean were found on his desk at komex international 
corp his importexport business 
dratch has argued that his client is a victim of entrapment and 
that the government overstepped its bounds during the investigation 
in his opinion sarokin said tape recordings submitted as 
evidence by the government appear to be incriminating but that 
he could not tell from the transcripts how strong the prosecutors 
case would be 
he said that in a jan 4 conversation between yun and 
codefendant charles caplan of london both parties seem to be 
abandoning the sarin transaction because they appear to realize 
that export from the united states may be prohibited 
prosecutors contend that yun was trying to obtain a bogus license 
to export the bombs and other military equipment including missiles 
and radar tubes

before his death to preserve his 1941 classic citizen kane 
saying dont let ted turner deface my movie with his crayons 
turner isnt listening his turner entertainment co said monday 
it is seeking to tint the blackandwhite account of a newspaper 
publisher which many film critics consider the best american movie 
ever made 
orson said to me at lunch about two weeks before he died i 
remember this vividly please do this for me dont let ted turner 
deface my movie with his crayons said film director henry jaglom 
at the age of 25 welles starred in wrote and directed the 
movie his first feature film he shared an oscar for the script and 
was nominated for best director and actor the film also starred 
joseph cotten agnes moorhead and everett sloane 
two companies are coloring test scenes of citizen kane to see 
if the process will work on the celebrated saga a turner 
spokeswoman said 
the tests are to determine whether coloring is feasible at 
all whether we have the elements required to do a topquality 
job spokeswoman alison hill said 
ted turner head of the turner broadcasting empire has said

a fifth of all senior federal judges including 
former chief justice warren e burger stand to collect their largest 
pay raises in a decade even though they no longer handle any court 
cases the associated press has learned 
this windfall increasing burgers salary by 60000 to 175000 
a year for example stems from a complex retirement system that 
allows federal judges to reduce their caseloads sharply while still 
qualifying for activeduty pay increases in stepping down from 
fulltime duty they accept a title of senior judge 
aside from burger the 305 other senior judges also stand to see 
their salaries rise by about 50 percent unless congress disapproves

a year after gaining the convictions of 
338 mobsters in italys socalled maxitrial a government drive 
against the mafia has lost momentum 
since those verdicts the mafia seems to have moved a step or 
more ahead of the state as the mob schemes to safeguard its 
interests which include billiondollar international drug 
trafficking and control of lucrative public contracts in developing 
southern italy 
investigators also suspect the king of the corleone crime family 
there actually is one comes and goes as he pleases in palermo 
sicilys capital and largest city 
the last photograph investigators have of the corleone leader 
salvatore riina is 30 years old and for all they know the man 
believed to be the most powerful mafioso in sicily today probably 
has had plastic surgery to change his looks 
alberto di pisa the chief antimafia prosecutor notes that the 
sicilians fear of mafia revenge and their mistrust of the state 
make it unlikely an ordinary citizen would turn riina in 
the corleone family gets its name from a sicilian town the 
american author mario puzo used that name for the main character in 
his novel the godfather and it was used as well in godfather 
movies while the corleone clan has its roots in the town its power 
base is believed to have shifted to palermo 
the claim that riina moves boldly and openly in parts of palermo 
was made on state television recently by salvatore totuccio 
contorno a mafiosoturnedinformer his testimony helped convict 
the 338 defendants many of them top mob bosses on murder drug and 
other charges in italys largestever case against the mob 
the interview was made in the united states where contorno lives 
under a secret identity provided by us authorities after he 
testified for them 
italian investigators ruefully acknowledge that the state of the 
antimafia front in italy is so dismal that contornos claim may 
well be true 
among the setbacks in the past year in the war against the mob 
the slaying of judge antonio saetta who had been assigned to 
hear the appeals of the maxitrial this year the mafia this decade 
has assassinated several investigating magistrates but until saetta 
was killed the mob left presiding judges alone 
a court ruling that prosecutors cant automatically try mob 
suspects in one mass trial on the sole basis that the mafia is 
directed by a palermobased commission which the state did in 
the maxitrial prosecutors say the ruling weakens their ability to 
present stronger more comprehensive cases that are more likely to 
hurt bigtime mob bosses 
for many prosecutors and police officials the appointment of 
domenico sica as the high commissioner against the mafia was 
virtually the only bright spot sica earned national fame as a 
prosecutor assigned top domestic and international terrorist cases 
but sica in a speech in january summing up his first six months 
as italys top antimafia fighter complained that he needs more 
experienced consultants and said the quality of information from a 
special intelligence unit at his disposal was unsatisfactory 
we cant provide a detailed picture of the mafia today said 
guido lo forte an investigating magistrate in a recent interview 
in palermos palace of justice 
he said the mob now appears to be circulating less and less 
important information within its ranks one way of eliminating the 
risk of witnesses 
at the same time the lack of a government witness protection 
program discourages potential informants two of informant 
contornos brothersinlaw were killed by the mob in palermo in 
recent months 
what investigators would especially like to know is new mafia 
strategies for avoiding tightened financial checks 
iron tower a joint usitalian investigation disclosed in 
december that south american cocaine was being sent to italy in 
exchange for heroin some of it shipped in liquified form in wine 
bottles 
according to investigators such bartering avoids incriminating 
bank records 
authorities say the sicilian mobs share of worldwide drug trade 
has declined in the past few years one reason is us and italian 
prosecution the other is competition from south american and asian 
crime syndicates 
the biggest chunk of mafia earnings today comes from political 
corruption and public contracts says pino arlacchi a sociologist 
who studies organized crime 
laws were enacted in the early 1980s requiring those bidding for 
public contracts to prove they had no mafia links but lo forte says 
the mob got around the restrictions in some cases by intimidating 
clean sicilian businessmen to front for mafia enterprises 
prosecutors also say that since the investigation that led to the 
maxitrial police work has yielded nothing of real substance four 
top antimafia detectives were slain by the mob in the last few 
years

mount hermon israeliannexed golan heights ap drivers ignore 
the sign closed military area hundreds of cars loaded with ski 
equipment climb the winding road each weekend to the only 
snowcapped mountain available 
mount hermon borders on syria and lebanon and affords the israeli 
army with a strategic look into enemy territory but that has not 
prevented the mountain from becoming a popular ski resort for 
israelis most of whom rarely see snow and are more accustomed to 
sundrenched mediterranean beaches 
as skiers whizzed down israels side of mount hermon one recent 
weekend soldiers with submachine guns gingerly stepped around 
toddlers on sleds brought to the resort by parents who might have 
driven four or five hours just so the youngsters could get their 
first taste of fun in the snow 
its not much but its all weve got said veteran skier 
aryeh morris 
morris said he first learned to ski in 1968 a year after the 
golan heights were captured by the israelis from syria there were 
no cable cars then and no ski resort but there was an army base and 
a shack at the top of the 6000foot mountain 
i used to hitch a ride up in a command car with troops and 
then i skied down thats how i learned how to ski he said 
since then he has joined the israel ski club and has taken annual 
trips to european resorts 
crowding takes some of the pleasure out of skiing at mount 
hermon one complaint is the snow blanket has been worn thin by too 
many skiers but there also is grousing about short trails high 
prices and an irregular policy on opening 
a day of skiing costs the equivalent of about 80 a price one 
israeli characterized as an arm and a leg israels average 
monthly wage is 800 
when theres a heavy snowstorm the resort is usually closed for 
the day because the owners cant clear access roads other times the 
army closes the mountain without warning for security reasons 
skiers also complain that their compatriots are rude on the 
slopes indeed there seems to be no hebrew equivalent for passing 
on the right or coming by on your left only an occasional 
grunt which usually comes too late 
theyre wild animals i wanted to clobber one kid said 
shmuel shene a 52yearold israeli businessman who prefers skiing 
in chamonix france theyre just like they are on the roads 
trying to show off 
the army usually doesnt enforce the closed military area 
warning but security is tight soldiers man the cable car stations 
using the mountain tops as lookout points to scan the area 
we live inside the army said eli sagron who manages the 
resort they need us and we need them 
mount hermon is popularly known in israel as the eyes of the 
nation a name that stuck after it was captured in the 1967 
arabisraeli war and an army officer used the phrase to stress the 
mountains strategic importance 
israel annnexed the golan heights in 1981 though syria still 
claims the territory the skilift is just two miles from the border 
with both syria israels most hardline foe and lebanon where 
guerrilla attacks often originate 
on the recent weekend troops spotted a man parachuting onto the 
slopes and were about to open fire when they were told he was a 
soldier who had permission to make the jump the soldiers thought he 
was a guerrilla using a new method to infiltrate 
last year just about 10 miles southeast of mount hermon a 
palestinian guerrilla hangglided into israeli from inside lebanon 
and attacked an army base killing six soldiers nearby mount dov 
has been the site of numerous arab infiltration attempts from 
lebanon 
but with all the troops on mount hermon said one soldier this 
is probably the safest place in israel 
at least 300000 visitors flock to the mountain each year during 
the decemberapril season according to sagron 
ninetyfive percent of them dont ski sagron said they 
come to play in the snow sled on the little plastic sleds and go up 
the cable car to see the view

iranian leaders of all stripes are calling 
for greater political and social freedom now that the war with iraq 
appears over and the islamic revolution reaches its 10th anniversary 
feb 11 
as the country prepares to face the challenges of peace after 
eight years of war in the persian gulf progressive religious 
figures are urging fresh interpretations of the sharia islams 
religious laws and cornerstone of irans rigid political and social 
system 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini irans supreme authority has thrown 
his weight behind the trend 
in a decree jan 4 he stressed the need for islam to adapt to 
the modern world his decree was seen as one of his most important 
pronouncements since the revolution that toppled shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi in 1979 
he called on the conservative council of guardians which has 
repeatedly blocked key economic legislation on the grounds it 
violated islams tenets to avoid obscure theological arguments that 
will drive us to dead ends 
khomeini 88 years old was reflecting a groundswell of sentiment 
among influential religious and political leaders seeking to move 
iran toward a decade of dawn 
the revolutionary patriarch who during the war with iraq 
repeatedly appealed to his bickering officials for unity refused 
requests in november that he settle a fierce debate over economic 
policy he urged open discussion 
he decreed that academic argument should be given a high place 
in islam and encouraged rather than suppressed because of 
dogmatic interpretations and authoritarian outlooks 
the progressive moves are taking place at the same time as a new 
wave of dissident executions in which by most accounts hundreds 
have died 
the executions along with the prospect of a power struggle for 
supremacy in the postkhomeini era and the influence among 50 
million iranians of the deeply entrenched mullahs or shiite moslem 
priests have made many people skeptical about just how far iran 
will progress along a progressive course 
travellers from tehran the capital say many iranians refer to 
the next 10 years the decade of dawn to officials as the decade 
of suffering 
nonetheless there are clear indications the winds of change are 
blowing stronger 
freedom of expression and other liberties were widely restricted 
during the persian gulf war but with the ceasefire restrictions 
appear to have been relaxed 
hojatoleslam mohammad javad hojati kermani a middleranking 
cleric who has become irans most popular newspaper columnist 
recently chided traditionalist mullahs 
in the same way that permitting what god has forbidden is 
forbidden forbidding what god has permitted is also forbidden he 
wrote in tehrans ettelaat newspaper 
i am puzzled why our religious authorities consider the safe 
course to be obsessively guarding the fortress of what has been 
forbidden rather than guarding the flower garden of what is indeed 
permitted by god 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani viewed as the governments 
leading pragmatist and architect of efforts to open up iran after a 
decade of isolation noted in a recent speech we still have a lot 
of unanswered questions with regard to society 
we have not come forward with clear principles in our foreign 
policy or in religious matters that vastly differ today from 
earlier eras of islam 
after the sacrifices of the war in which by some estimates 1 
million iranians were killed iranians want to enjoy the fruits of 
peace 
scheherazade daneshku a parisbased iranian analyst noted that 
leaders like rafsanjani understand that now some of the more 
puritanical and uncompromising aspects of islamic rule will almost 
certainly have to be dispensed with 
khomeinis designated successor ayatollah husseinali montazeri 
who has long urged wider freedoms told islamic students last 
october freedom of expression is the natural and 
constitutional right of every individual 
the officials of this country and the revolution who 
experienced the bitter taste of repression under the monarchy 
should take notice of this and avoid the assumption we no longer 
need freedom of expression 
montazeri warned should we grow intolerant to challenges to 
our ideas these challenges will inevitably turn into bullets 
parliament member elias hazrati declared during a debate on 
postwar reconstruction and the future shape of society ten years 
after the revolution we have to bitterly admit that we have not 
been successful in developing and reforming the systems we inherited 
from the former regime 
cleric kermani noted in one of his columns there are still 
people who refuse to listen to the radio watch television or 
believe that women should not participate in marches and friday 
prayers let alone parliament 
some citizens are still heard complaining about the songs aired 
on the radio and tv they are against women appearing on television 
as newscasters interviewers and actresses and doubt the 
advisability of consorting with foreign nonmoslems infidels 
communists and women who do not wear the chador cloaklike dress 
khomeini said in a letter oct5 to hojatoleslam mohammad hussein 
qadiri a senior religious scholar at the qom seminary who 
questioned the ayatollahs ruling that chess and musical instruments 
were permissible under islamic law according to your reverences 
interpretation of the hagiological tradition modern civilization 
should be destroyed and people should go back to mud huts or live in 
deserts forever 
khomeini urged qadiri to avoid being affected by sanctimonious 
and illiterate mullahs whom many iranians criticize for burying 
religion in inflexible tenets and medieval interpretations of the 
koran islams holy book 
kermani noted that khomeinis precepts are the start of a new 
revolution in our deeprooted traditional theology now is 
the time to explicitly say that there must be a transformation a 
revolution in the way that the huge resources of the rich shiite 
theology are being exploited 
he said the brand of theology presented by backwardlooking 
clerics is not capable of managing a home or a village let alone 
a country 
mohammad hashemi rafsanjanis brother and head of the staterun 
television and radio network called in a november for greater media 
freedom to air grievances and criticism of the government 
official action he added in an interview published by his 
networks soroush magazine had prevented his organization from 
doing our duty in reflecting criticisms to the extent that our 
mission requires 
soroush also carried an interview with mahdi nasari 
editorinchief of kayhan irans largest selling newspaper in 
which he said the press has not done enough to criticize the 
revolutions shortcomings 
if a society is deprived of the blessing of criticism and 
critical encounters throughout the mass media then it can be 
said that it is a society facing gradual death and at the very 
least decline he said

irans leaders are trying to woo tens of 
thousands of skilled exiles home to help with the massive task of 
postwar reconstruction but few emigres seem ready to risk it 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani considered the most 
powerful figure in iran after ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and 
others are moving to encourage political and social liberalization 
in part to entice educated iranians home 
rafsanjani declared at a recent tehran rally if we give up 
some of the shortsightedness some of the crude aspects which 
were the requirements of the early stages of the revolution and 
which we do not need today we will attract them back 
at least 2 million iranians including scientists technocrats 
managers and academics fled after khomeinis 1979 islamic 
revolution toppled shah mohammad reza pahlavi and during the 8year 
war against iraq 
they included many young men dodging military service who were 
often smuggled out of the country illegally monarchists leftists 
and disaffected middle class businessmen 
unofficial estimates indicate that only about onefifth of 
iranians sent abroad to complete their studies have returned home 
iran badly needs technical expertise for reconstruction 
few of the exiles ranging from former government and 
revolutionary leaders to shopkeepers and students contacted in 
several countries by the associated press showed any desire to 
return to iran now 
abolhassan banisadr the islamic republics first president who 
fled to france in 1981 amid a bloody purge of liberals and leftists 
said i dont think these appeals will have any result these days 
there are executions by the hundreds and all the reactions to 
the appeals has been negative 
shahpour bakhtiar the last iranian prime minister under the 
shah who is also living in france said no exile in a financial 
position to return would do so the way things are at present 
security is more precarious the law less respected than at 
any time since the shahs days the way the leaders of the 
country treat internal opposition does not inspire trust 
as long as the government and i dont think there is one is 
not able to respect the rights of people i dont think that anyone 
who has a certain value a certain effectiveness will have a 
desire to return 
mohammad vavood a spokesman for the opposition mujahedeen 
khalq or peoples holy warriors in cologne west germany said 
i know of no one whos planning to return it would be suicide to 
go back to iran now 
abol ghassem kargar 67 who runs a supermarket in los angeles 
now after fleeing through turkey said when reached while back in 
turkey if the mullahs go id go back and so would 80 percent of 
the exiles i know 
kargar said he fled iran in 1983 after revolutionary guards 
killed his son sina along with 130 women and 440 men in a tehran 
prison when they staged a protest demanding better conditions 
he said his son a graduate of the university of california at 
los angeles was a civil engineering professor at tehran university 
when he was arrested by the revolutionary guards for allegedly not 
including islamic teaching in his classes 
kargar said the guards later seized two private girls schools he 
owned and ran in tehran for 20 years along with the family villa on 
the caspian sea 
he was in istanbul seeking to take his sister fatima 55 to the 
united states his three daughters who now live with him in 
california had fled iran via pakistan and afghanistan after he got 
out

ronald h brown doesnt intend to lead the 
democratic party as a symbol although hell be one or as a 
liberal although he is one 
he is about to become the first black chairman of a national 
political party and he vows to build the democrats a campaign 
organization that can help win the white house something they have 
managed only once since 1964 
brown is a sure thing to be elected chairman of the democratic 
national committee on feb 10 to succeed paul g kirk jr 
brown 47 an urbane lawyerlobbyist with a lengthy political 
resume says the chairmans job is not a pulpit for any ideology 
left or right he promises evenhanded leadership at the national 
committee especially when candidates begin lining up for the 1992 
presidential campaign 
one of them is likely to be jesse jackson browns candidate in 
1988 when he served as convention manager for the black challenger 
to nominee michael dukakis they are allies and friends but brown 
says his new role will lead inevitably to differences 
im not looking to set up a fight to prove something he said 
in an interview brown said that when his new responsibilities 
require saying no to jackson thats what hell do 
setup or not that will send a useful signal to his southern and 
conservative opponents who insist that race is not a factor but 
that browns liberal ties send the wrong message to the voters who 
have chosen republican presidents in four of the last five elections 
again and again brown has pointed out that the jackson campaign 
was a 90day assignment in a long political career but it was the 
most visible as he negotiated for jackson in televised glare of the 
atlanta convention and it now is the one with which he is most 
widely identified 
not that his earlier affiliations win points with the partys 
more conservative wing after working at the national urban league 
brown served as a committee aide to sen edward m kennedy and as a 
deputy manager in the massachusetts senators losing bid for the 
1980 democratic presidential nomination 
kirk was kennedys campaign manager that year theres no sign 
that kennedy has reaped any benefits from the fact that one former 
aide has been party chairman and another is about to take over the 
job 
as chairman kirk made his mark with a relatively low profile he 
engineered the elimination of midterm conventions issues 
conferences which had become forums for ideological warfare he also 
ended party recognition of special interest caucuses calling them 
political nonsense neither of those steps fit the liberal agenda 
party chairmen often are little known outside washington and 
political circles brown will be out front as chairman thats 
obviously his preference but the lower profile wouldnt be an 
option even if he sought it as the first black chairman he is sure 
to be a spokesman on issues and topics that go beyond the nuts and 
bolts business of political organization 
ive got to be one of several messengers he said a 
spokesman as well as a technician senate majority leader george 
mitchell and house speaker jim wright are the ranking messengers 
brown said he already has discussed his role with them 
now he has to sort it out with skeptics with democrats who see 
him as the wrong representative to choose after a presidential 
election in which the l word liberal was used by republicans as 
a political curse to that end even before the committee election 
brown plans a swing across the south to reach out raise the 
comfort level 
he knows the democrats have problems on issues like national 
defense law and order federal spending but he says copying 
republicans is no answer the last thing this country needs is two 
republican parties brown said one is quite enough 
that has a familiar ring as newlyelected chairman in 1985 kirk 
said much the same thing and immediately went south saying he 
didnt need to wait for an invitation to go fencemending 
today marks the end of the soulsearching the end of the 
identity crisis of the democratic party kirk said four years ago 
when he became chairman

some 30 years ago an explosive drama by a unknown 
young black woman defied the odds the experts and the money men to 
open on broadway 
lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun which starred 
sidney poitier went on to win critical raves and established 
itself as a cornerstone in amnerican theater 
while the story of a black chicago familys move from the ghetto 
into a white neighborhood has been produced thousands of times and 
has captivated millions of theater patrons and moviegoers worldwide 
hansberrys original play has never been seen in its entirety 
however a new uncut production will be broadcast by pbs on feb 
1 it stars danny glover and esther rolle it is the years first 
production in the american playhouse now in its eighth season 
the new production will include nearly an hours worth of 
restored material including themes of feminism african nationalism 
and black pride 
nothing that was cut was cut to censor the play said robert 
nemiroff the late playwrights husband and literary executor 
pressures were enormous to keep the play as tight and streamlined 
as it could possibly be 
when the play opened on broadway in 1959 walter kerr writing 
for the new york herald tribune called it an impressive first 
play beautifully acted relieving and wonderfully caustic 
comedy 
directed by lloyd richards it ran for two years and received the 
new york drama critics award for best play it is the story of a 
family whose prospects for the future brighten considerably when 
misfortune strikes the death of walter younger sr leaves his wife 
with a 10000 lifeinsurance policy and the problem of how to use 
it 
her son a chauffeur wants the money to start a new business 
and her daughter needs money for medical school another option the 
wife sees is buying a new home for the family 
in one restored scene a neighbor comes in with a newspaper story 
about the bombing of a black familys house after they had moved 
into a white neighborhood 
this obviously shows the danger the youngers are facing at the 
curtain said bill duke director of the pbs production it 
makes clear that for all the joy and affirmation of the familys 
inner triumph at the end it is anything but a traditional happy 
ending the scene was cut from the broadway production to save the 
added cost of another actors salary 
it took producer philip rose nearly two years to find a 
coproducer and the money to stage the production even with the 
money in hand broadway theaters were not willing to rent to the new 
production until it had proved itself out of town nemiroff said 
but once on stage the shortened play which with an uncanny 
prescience foresaw the rise of black pride and nationalism in the 
united states and africa became a hit with both blacks and whites 
never before in the entire history of the american theater had 
so much of the truth of black peoples lives been seen on the 
stage the late author james baldwin wrote 
while not autobiographical raisin had its origins in 
hansberrys own childhood experiences in chicago in the 1930s when 
her family moved into a white neighborhood they were evicted from 
their home by an illinois court but her father a prosperous 
realestate broker and banker fought the case to the us supreme 
court which outlawed the restrictive covenant 
after trying her hand at painting and determining she had no 
talent hansberry moved to new york in 1950 where she concentrated 
on her writing but made little effort at publishing and earned a 
living with a number of odd jobs although she wrote extensively 
she completed only two plays during her brief life a raisin in 
the sun and the sign in sidney brusteins window she died of 
cancer in 1965 at the age of 34 
nemiroff who married hansberry in 1953 has devoted much of his 
life since her death to editing and shaping her works into 
publishable form including the wellreceived to be young gifted 
and black and les blancs 
hal dewindt a teacher director and associate producer of the 
pbs production of raisin said that aside from the restoration 
of the original material this newest version differs from many 
previous productions in one important respect 
every moment is motivated by love as opposed to it being a 
competition between people he said in other productions it was 
more a fight to see who was more powerful the message is much 
clearer and much more universal if it hadnt been done that way it 
would have been just another play about who is more powerful than 
who 
rose and david susskind produced the movie version in 1961 
directed by daniel petrie it starred poitier ruby dee claudia 
mcneil diana sands and lou gossett jr

throughout the 700 or so years of its 
recorded existence chalco has had its share of troubles erupting 
volcanos conquests by the aztecs and then the spaniards and 
hangings during the mexican revolution 
now it has troubles it never knew before 
crowding crime and muggings addiction and unemployment the 
ecology and a lack of schools drinking water electricity sewage 
police and paving you name the problem we have it said mayor 
javier tellez sanz 
all the problems afflicting modern mexico seem to have converged 
on chalco whose population has swelled from 1200 in the early 
1900s to 6000 in 1975 to 50000 now 
the chief reason is that chalco less than 20 miles from the 
great volcanic cones of popocatepetl and ixtaccihuatl is just a bus 
commute away from overcrowded mexico city thousands of poor have 
poured in from the countryside and made chalco a ramshackle bedroom 
the town is one more sign that mexico is changing from a mostly 
rural to a mostly urban society 
in 1930 less than 20 percent of mexicans lived in urban areas 
mexico citys population was just over 1 million in 1985 the urban 
population was 56 percent and climbing mexico citys population is 
19 million 
mexico city already polluted and chaotic has spread deep into 
the dusty valleys that surround it 
and chalco county a spread of 7410 acres about 40 miles 
southeast of mexico city now includes 14 villages and more than 20 
hamlets and has become home to a fastgrowing population of about 
450000 
in many ways chalco is a microcosm of mexicos many woes 
said francisco xalpa benitez the countys honorary historian 
benitez an anthropolgist is mayor tellezs uncle although both 
are 42 years old 
in a joint interview they said chalcos troubles began about 20 
years ago when the countys six ejidos or ancestral community 
farms fell to urban development 
word quickly spread and thousands started flocking in from the 
countryside most of them as squatters who built tar paper shacks 
they commuted to mexico city a 90minute bus ride away where jobs 
were plentiful and the pay almost double that of their home villages 
they came from the south the west and from as far north as the 
state of zacatecas 500 miles away 
during the last five years the situation turned explosive 
tellez said chalcos population has been growing by about 20 
percent a year compared to about 2 percent nationally 
in the city about half the population lacks drinking water 
electricity and sewage only five streets have blacktops 
there is a shortage of clinics hospitals and classrooms two 
years ago benitez said he quit his job teaching high school 
history because of unruly students he now runs an appliance repair 
shop 
it used to be a pleasure watching kids learn but no more he 
said 
chalco has small weaving electronics metalstamping 
pharmaceutical and scissors and knife industries but some of the 
plants are polluting the areas few remaining waterways the 
industries cant provide enough jobs combined unemployment and 
underemployment runs about 60 percent in the town 
added to the alcoholism drug addiction and crime are the sharks 
and con men who have been selling forged deeds to squatters plots 
chalco has always had more than its share of misfortune 
benitez said but even though now things appear to be less 
manageable were not fazed 
the valley where chalco sits has been buried at least 18 times by 
volcanic eruptions the last time around 1300 when iztapalteyotl 
blew its top 
about half the population died when the aztecs conquered the town 
in 1485 forced labor and disease brought in by the spanish conquest 
less than half a century later reduced the population from 6000 to 
3000 by the 19th century hundreds were shot and hanged during the 
19101920 mexican revolution slashing the citys population to 
1200 
lumbering did away with the evergreen oak and eucalyptus forests 
in the lowlands and late in the last century dictator porfirio diaz 
started doing away with the lake 
diaz started draining lake chalco just to increase the acreage 
of his soninlaws ranch benitez said before that you could 
navigate all the way to downtown farmers used to 
send their crops to market in barges 
by the 1940s the lake was down to a marsh and the government in 
mexico city decided to drain it mexico city and leaving dry land that 
swirls into 
huge gritty dust storms in winter 
the result was more runoff and reduced irrigation leaving 
farmers unable to grow multiple crops in the same year 
now were lucky if they get one good crop a year benitez 
said 
some 400 artesian wells take water to mexico city so much water 
is taken from the wells that benitez says one day the entire 
county could just collapse down to the bottom of the earth

the battered classrooms of pace community college signaling the 
rebirth of a private high school that was once a showpiece of us 
investment in black education 
when pace opened in 1982 the 6million tan brick building 
gleamed like a wellendowed institution in a wealthy american 
suburb despite the grassy 22acre campus separating it from 
sowetos dirt streets and shabby bungalows the school now seems to 
belong to an innercity slum 
offering commercial studies as an alternative to sowetos rundown 
state schools pace suffered during the 198487 period of nationwide 
black unrest and school boycotts against apartheid militants 
advocating peoples education tagged pace as elitist politics 
and violence distracted the students and few passed their exams the 
school closed for several months 
principals came and went vandals invaded the building us 
companies that had built the school withdrew their support the 
staff served without pay and enrollment shrank 
as the new term began jan 25 the roof leaked and the telephone 
didnt work toilets and lockers were broken books chairs and 
teachers were scarce

principal and lekgau mathabathe 63 chairman of a new school board 
composed entirely of soweto residents both were school principals 
in soweto in 1976 and from their schools came leaders of student 
riots against afrikaanslanguage instruction imposed by the 
whiteminority government 
both resigned to support the student protest kambule becoming a 
university mathematics teacher mathabathe joining a foodprocessing 
company 
kambule retains a reputation as an insirational teacher who gets 
results and his arrival at pace in mid1988 was particularly 
welcomed by sowetans 
parents have confidence children started coming back from 
private schools in johannesburg kambule said in an interview 
im budgeting for the full number of 600 students and ive had to 
send hundreds away 
some of paces us corporate backers have divested and left 
south africa but those that remain are showing renewed interest 
we no longer have any say in running the school but we have 
recommended to our members that they become involved financially 
again said adrian botha executive director of the american 
chamber of commerce in south africa one company has already 
appointed a fund raiser for pace 
students are required to pay only half their annual fees of 3000 
rand 1250 and company donations are expected to make up the 
balance mathabathe said pace needs 60000 rands 25000 a month 
to stay open and much more to renovate the building and increase 
salaries 
the school increasingly has encouraged community involvement 
civic groups use the gymnasium and the auditorium is rented out for 
church services wedding receptions and taxi drivers meetings 
but kambule emphasized that paces goal remains the same to 
provide a superior education to blacks seeking middlemanagement 
business jobs the first pace students to take final high school 
exams under kambules direction numbered only 55 but 31 passed by 
far the best percentage of any soweto school last year 
im interested in children setting out on their own for the 
future through education kambule said i tell them dont 
call me principal im your employee im in your service but 
theres lots of discipline 
he appears to have ended paces political isolation from sowetos 
young militants 
people have been asking for alternative education i explain 
that this is an alternative school kambule said 
politics in the school arent over the revolution is still on 
but they shouldnt treat us like they treat a government school 
kambule said he allowed a youth group to use the auditorium last 
year to celebrate the birthday of the imprisoned black leader nelson 
mandela 
they came to me afterward and said we didnt think youd let 
us i replied why not its your school

editors note gridlock in the vast open skyways well its not 
that dire yet but aviation officials are worried that todays 
airports wont be able to handle the amount of traffic expected in 
the next decade or so further little is being done about it here 
is a report from an ap reporter who covers the aviation beat in 
washington

on the day before christmas some 2 million 
people rushed to airports across america expecting turmoil or 
delays they often found both 
that kind of airport crush now usually seen only on thanksgiving 
and christmas is likely to become commonplace by the year 2000 when 
the airlines expect to carry nearly 800 million passengers a year 
an average of more than 2 million every day 
hello gridlock 
yes aviation officials are beginning to worry about a logjam in 
the air 
once the domain of businessmen and the wellheeled the airlines 
have become a mass transit system a record 455 million passengers 
boarded commercial aircraft in 1988 nearly 12 million people a 
day compared to 243 million in l977 
three of every 10 adults took an airline flight last year and 
nearly three of every four adults had flown at some point in their 
lives 
yet no major new airports have been built since 1974 when the 
dallasfort worth airport was constructed on 18000acres of texas 
prairie and while local officials have received agreement on a 
massive futuristic 3 billion airport at denver the airlines there 
have balked because of the cost 
add to that an air traffic control system still struggling to 
recover from a 1981 strike plus federal budget constraints 
the holiday passenger crunch gives us all a glimpse into the 
future of air traffic bemoans herbert kelleher chairman of 
southwest airlines he says the air transport system of today 
lacks the capacity to handle that volume of traffic on a daily 
basis he also says there are scant signs that anything is being 
done about it 
i think the single biggest concern in aviation is the capacity 
issue agrees john lauber a member of the national transportation 
safety board 
the traffic demands also raise safety worries he says 
especially since it is unlikely that dozens of new runways and 
airports will be constructed and broad modernization of the air 
traffic control system is years away 
there are real questions as to how we are going to accommodate 
this growth lauber warns 
he acknowledges that there are ways to solve the congestion 
problem short of pouring new concrete but he says the danger is 
that these things will be done before all of the ramifications are 
thought through from a safety standpoint the pressure is there 
among the shortterm solutions being considered by the federal 
aviation administration are adopting new technology to allow more 
planes to land in a shorter time span and increasing use of 
computers to predict traffic flow 
indeed the overcrowding is being felt both in the air and on the 
ground 
seventeen airports used by 40 percent of the flying public were 
classified in 1988 as seriously congested because they handled 
160 percent of the traffic for which they were designed by the year 
2000 that number could go as high as 58 airports used by nearly 
three out of every four travelers according to the faa 
officials at bostons logan international airport say as far as 
theyre concerned aviation gridlock already has arrived 
last summer the massachusetts port authority which runs logan 
imposed a new fee structure that makes it too expensive for owners 
of small planes and even some commuter airlines to land the local 
officials argue that in an era of scarce resources priority must be 
given to large jetliners carrying hundreds of people 
the federal transportation department has called the action an 
interference with national commerce and threatens to withhold 
federal airport funds if the fees are not reversed the logan 
officials meanwhile are standing firm and intend to fight the dot 
ruling in court 
the faa is still trying to recover from the 1981 strike by air 
traffic controllers in which 11400 were fired and had to be 
replaced by inexperienced recruits while senior managers have drawn 
up new flight patterns and adopted a system of central flow 
control to better manage airspace with fewer controllers problems 
persist 
only last fall controllers at chicagos busy ohare 
international airport began making errors so frequently that the 
federal government ordered a cut in flights as a result the number 
of delays jumped 
furthermore the agencys sevenyear focus on damage control and 
governmentwide budget constraints have delayed for several years 
the longrange modernization of its air traffic control system 
the overhauled system is now scheduled for completion in the late 
1990s at a cost of 16 billion to 24 billion 
but many airline executives complain that the capacity crunch is 
already here 
we tend to be making a conscious effort to do everything 
possible to restrain the transportation system that lies at the core 
of travel and tourism complains robert crandall chairman of 
american airlines 
problems with air traffic control and restrictions of various 
kinds already stifle competition he argues 
today american cant compete with eastern pan am or donald 
trump who recently bought the eastern shuttle between washington 
and new york we cant add flights to and from chicago nor can we 
operate the ones we already have there with the slightest assurance 
that they will either arrive or leave on time 
even in nashville our flights often sit on the ground waiting 
for a slot in the sky the reality is we are making air travel 
harder and harder rather than making it easier and easier 
the airlines for more than a year have warned of impending chaos 
but a 15 million grassroots campaign to persuade business and 
political leaders to push for new airport capacity has so far 
produced little 
i dont see a hell of a lot of difference between our aviation 
problems a year ago and our aviation problems today except today 
they are worse crandall said at a recent industry conference 
the industry is especially critical of the governments handling 
of the billions of dollars that are collected each year through an 8 
percent ticket tax the money goes into a special trust fund but in 
recent years much more went in than has come out

the aviation trust funds surplus has grown to 6 billion a 
reserve that its critics complain has helped the reagan 
administration hide some of the federal deficit if the trust fund 
were handled that way by a private trustee complained kelleher of 
southwest he would have been indicted for misappropriation of 
funds 
an effort to separate the aviation fund from the overall federal 
budget failed last year but the airlines have vowed to try again in 
the new congress 
but the airlines are not free of fault either according to their 
critics 
most of the capacity problems that exist today as well as many 
of the problems envisioned for the years to come stem largely from 
the strategies the airlines have devised under deregulation 
their concentration of flights at hub airports has caused 
massive peaking of traffic in and out of cities such as chicago 
denver atlanta and dallasfort worth since 70 percent or more of 
the passengers in many cases are only passing through these 
airports layover time is minimized and a large number of planes 
must land and depart in a short time 
on the other hand airports at smaller cities often beg for more 
business 
we dont have a lack of airport capacity we have a lack of 
airport capacity the way we use it today argues charles barclay 
executive director of the american association of airport 
executives a trade group representing airport managers 
barclay maintains that many airports in midsized cities are 
underused and are often ignored as possible hubs officials in 
columbus ohio have offered 30 million over 10 years to any major 
airline that would start a hub there but there have been no takers 
he says 
the airlines argue that they need significant local traffic to 
make a major hub successful 
as traffic increases barclay predicts pressure will mount for 
carriers to seek out the smaller cities as well 
the airlines also have been criticized for not following up on 
their own rhetoric on the construction of new airports they cite 
the example of the proposed denver airport 
planners foresee no fewer than 12 runways although half that 
many would be built initially for the scheduled opening in the 
mid1990s 
but both united airlines and continental airlines who are the 
major carriers at denver have balked arguing the plan is too 
grand too expensive and unneeded at this time especially in light 
of the regions economic downturn 
airports are largely financed through the issuance of bonds 
which are paid off from fees assessed to the airlines continental 
claims the new denver airport would add 36 to the price of a 
ticket compared to the 4 surcharge at the current stapleton 
international airport 
mayor frederico pena who has staked his political career on 
getting the airport built makes no secret of his anger toward the 
airlines 
either we have a crisis in air transportation in this country 
or we dont he said 
the irony of the airlines position in denver has not been lost 
on washington bureaucrats 
jim burnley transportation secretary under ronald reagan called 
the airlines stand in denver as well as the industrys lukewarm 
attitude toward developing a third major airport in the chicago area 
irresponsible and hypocritical at a time when the industry talks 
of a capacity crisis 
its time those who come to conferences in washington and sound 
off about the perceived shortcomings of the federal government in 
this area to get their own houses in order if they want to see 
capacity of the system grow in the years to come burnley said in 
an interview 
spokesmen for both continental and united insist the two airlines 
continue to favor construction of a new denver airport but the 
question is one of cost 
wed like to build one that we can afford and wed like to 
build it in the time frame that we need martin shugrue president 
of continental said in an interview 
airline reluctance to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into a 
new airport may be understandable suggest industry analysts in 
light of other costs facing the air carriers as of last october 
the scheduled air carriers had orders and options for 1301 new 
aircraft worth 59 billion and the airlines are still ordering new 
jetliners according to airline economics inc 
and there are competitive questions that come into play at an 
airport such as denver where united and continental dominate or 
chicago where american and united are supreme 
if you own the hub says faa administrator allan mcartor 
youre not too interested in adding capacity so somebody can come 
in and share your nest thats just a fact of life 
that may be one reason why the industry has yet to develop a 
master plan as to where any new airports should be built gabe 
philips executive vice president of the air transport association 
the airline trade group says such a master plan would be 
difficult to get agreement on because of the costs involved 
nevertheless insist the airlines the greatest barrier to the 
construction of new runways and airports is not the industry but 
local opposition or the nimby folks as they have been called 
the not in my back yard philosophy is not likely to go away 
soon says henry duffy president of the 40000member air line 
pilots association 
and if new airports and runways are not built duffy predicts the 
government will have no choice but to restrict traffic where there 
isnt enough capacity 
well have de facto reregulation whether we call it 
reregulation or not duffy says 
the answer in the view of many industry executives is for the 
federal government to become more aggressive in pushing for new 
airports or airport expansion where the lack of capacity is seen as 
impeding commerce 
burnley calls suggestions that a new runway or airport might be 
forced on a community as hopelessly naive and adds 
youre simply not going to be able to politically run roughshod 
over the rights of neighbors of airports the congress would not let 
us do that

you probably ought to go see leo 
schwab said the phoner a member of silicon valleys vast 
brotherhood of computer hackers hes a wizard even wears a 
cape 
so off to see the wizard following if not the yellow brick road 
the too good to be true golden gate bridge en route 
the wizard capeless opened the door of a brandnew suburban 
town house his lair absent clouds of steam or a wizardly 
switching panel was equipped with california wall hangings and 
laidback furniture schwab himself lankytall whose unlined face 
of 24 years was framed by an auburn beard was further deflationary 
im not a wizard maybe a semiwizard 
schwab was to demonstrate however that he could make a computer 
essentially only an electronic box that can either say yes or no 
pirouette magically under his spell 
computers consume almost all my waking hours said schwab 
whose sleep phase runs from about 3 am to 10 am 
this is one of the identifying field marks of the hacker breed 
dedicated long oddball hours 
i want to write software and make a lot of money a common but 
not always present field mark of a hacker and almost an invariable 
hallmark of the species have fun 
fun at the expense of the nations computer networks that 
transfer billions of dollars of bank money daily monitor heartbeats 
in hospitals command satellites in space switch all those zillions 
of phone calls is not what hacking is about hackers resent being 
grouped with those who maliciously plant worms and viruses that 
befuddle computers hackers call them crackers 
schwab has been too engrossed getting a unicycle to juggle red 
balls on a computer screen to waste time goosing ma bell 
leos apotheosis to semiwizardry is not untypical 
hes a native of the san francisco bay area where kids absorb the 
binary system almost before they learn to stay afloat in hot tubs 
hacking of course is now worldwide but its bethlehem was at mit 
in cambridge mass and then silicon valley leos father was a 
mechanic his mother a housewife they produced a leo gifted with a 
vivid imagination 
i talked to myself a lot and daydreamed usually with me in the

freeloading hacker 
they were permissive they let me run anything i played pong 
in color on an apple amazing it was a black art then 
in the ninth grade leo was introduced to the computer lab at san 
rafael high i spent every spare moment there i wanted to realize 
things in my imagination on the screen i had a lot of kooky ideas i 
couldnt realize in other ways i rarely achieved this because my 
mind was three years ahead of the technology 
leo made do buying 6 disk drives for paleozoic computers while 
waiting for the industry to catch up he meanwhile devised his first 
computer game while daydreaming in algebra class 
then i graduated and suddenly was without a machine a 
computerland threw me out for the last time 
what was an apprentice wizard to do 
leo had had a newspaper route everyone on it found their paper 
precisely where they wanted it every day 
such diligence had earned him the scratch to buy a 1200 
commodore computer when they first came out computer games had been 
sweeping the country making their teenage inventors almost as rich 
as rock stars or junk bond salesmen 
the computers combination of speed programmability and endless 
permutations makes it a natural for games by quick minds one of the 
first was concocted in the late 1950s by the three young programmers 
at bell laboratories in new jersey the idea of the game dubbed 
core war was to wipe out the memory of an opponents computer all 
in fun of course 
one of the players ironically was robert morris whose son is 
suspected of having infected a major computer network last fall in 
what he may have thought was a hack but others think a crack 
in the 70s computer games did for electronics what the rumble 
seat once did for necking everyone wanted to try out the new 
technology by the original hacker ethic evolved first at mit and 
described by steven levy in his landmark history hackers 
computers were a gift from the gods to mans ingenuity and should be 
thus forevermore free money got its nose in the tent however with 
the rage for game software donkey pong pacman frogger

editors note the very words outward bound prompt visions 
of campfires and river rafts but in new york city its a fact the 
venerable wilderness movement has set out to tame the asphalt 
jungle 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on a wall in the small office of rudy rodrigues 
a leader of outward bound hangs a detailed map of the wilderness 
his charges must conquer in pursuit of survival through 
selfconfidence 
this challenge is particularly tough the map is of new york city 
americas large cities are asphalt jungles all right at least in 
metaphor but for more than a quartercentury in america outward 
bound has evoked images of wellheeled executives and wellscrubbed 
youths in expensive hiking boots breathing clean air on faraway 
mountains 
so whats a nice program like that doing in a place like this 
its long overdue says rodrigues or would appear so from 
the results of our first year this is no experiment were 
committed now and going all out 
actually rodrigues says urban outward bound programs are a 
return to first principles the organization was founded to teach 
resourcefulness confidence compassion perseverance and 
selfesteem but always has tried to include the ideal of service as 
well 
its not easy to stress the service ideal in the wilderness 
he says 
the traditional outward bound schools cater to the more 
privileged so this is a shift from the traditional in the city we 
serve our focus right now is on innercity youth and the homeless 
serving outward bound crews have renovated shelters picnicked 
with homeless children distributed food but on the theory that 
most urban discord results from people of varied ethnic and economic 
stripes threatening and fearing one another relieving social 
tensions rodrigues feels might be the best service of all 
indeed outward bound is so satisfied with its work in concrete 
canyons that a staff is already setting up a similar program in 
chicago and others are planned in boston baltimore los angeles and 
minneapolis 
a typical new york outward bound program matches a dozen or so 
corporate executives with an equal number of disadvantaged persons 
of various ages and cultures and turns them all loose on the town 
for a few days with an instructor 
the haves live work and discourse with the havenots an 
unlikely gettogether in any town the haves moreover must make do 
without cab fare credit cards or carpet slippers 
they will sleep outdoors in blankets walk where they want to go 
or ride the subway if they have a token they find meals as best 
they can and as cheaply 
without exception participants report that the experience gave 
them a new less judgmental perception of the lower crust even a 
bond with them and thus a clearer view of the citys social 
problems 
for their part the innercity folk discarded longheld 
prejudices among themselves black kids and hispanic kids in new 
york grow up believing that white kids are weak one 18yearold 
black reported white participants werent aware of that 
the corporation picks up the outward bound tuition for its own 
execs and also for their classmates 60 a day each same fee as the 
traditional courses out yonder 
the course relies on proven wilderness techniques transferred to 
the cityscape with of course some compromises 
instead of testing endurance by dashing across mountain meadows 
for example the new yorkers take laps around the central park 
reservoir instead of going hand over hand across a chasm they 
climb in the rigging of a fourmaster at the south street seaport 
museum instead of a whitewater raft adventure they row an 
eightoar lifeboat up the east river

the lessons apparently have the same results says one graduate 
in the boat all of us were strangers but until we discovered 
that we had to pull together we went in circles 
on one expedition 18 men and youths recruited from a shelter for 
the homeless in harlem were taken to fort tryon park not exactly 
yosemite but it did afford a 40foot rock wall all 18 scaled it 
in the shelter one recalled afterward we didnt trust one 
another we fought we were selfish 
out there on that rock there was a guy on top with a rope and 
my safety depended on him when it was over the relationship we had 
with one another was totally different 
that lesson and even more so the lifeboat lesson harks back to 
the origin of outward bound 
during world war ii the head of a british shipping firm 
lawrence holt decided that too many of his sailors despite 
lifeboats were being lost at sea when their ships were sunk 
he consulted kurt hahn operator of a prominent boys school 
hahn in 1941 opened a school in wales to teach young mariners 
selfconfidence smallboat handling routefinding rescue and 
community service 
holt named the program outward bound a nautical term for the 
point at which a ship leaves safe harbor for the open sea 
now outward bound programs thrive in 36 countries only two 
others britain and the netherlands include urban programs but 
according to rodrigues the new york director neither has the scope 
of the new york operation 
we conducted 10 programs last year and so far this year we have 
planned 16 weekend courses and two 16day courses which will be a 
blend of the wilderness and the city he says these will run 
april through november 
meanwhile says rodrigues beaming his curriculum includes 
continuing programs in four of new yorks polyglot high schools 
which have had racial and ethnic clashes 
the high school programs not surprisingly in new york use 
techniques of the theater students act out roles exposing 
bigotries and foolish fears the results are especially satisfying 
to the executive director 
rudy rodrigues was born in kenya in 1941 when it was a british 
colony his father was a british civil servant born in goa a 
portuguese colony in india his mother was born in karachi then a 
part of india 
rodrigues is a lean swarthy man with vivid brown eyes behind 
aviator glasses a mane of thick black curly hair lit with strands 
of silver brushes the neck of his sweater jeans and sweaters are 
the work clothes of his staff as well in characteristic contrast 
with the threepiece suits and straight skirts predominant in the 
midtown manhattan skyscraper where they work 
when i was a boy rodrigues was saying the other day all 
the various races in kenya lived and grew up and worked in isolation 
of one another after 10th grade i went to outward bound it was my 
first opportunity to be together with people of different races and 
backgrounds 
one of my instructors was a british army officer he kept 
talking about this place called sandhurst the royal military 
academy he told us only the best the creme de la creme could get 
in 
here i was a kid from a colony nonenglish what chance had i 
but because of my outward bound experience i decided hell i think 
ill go i knew it was up to me so i went 
after an army tour and a stint with the united nations fighting 
famine rodrigues moved to new york the notion of an urban outward 
bound program fascinated him 
i believe the urban backdrop has a much more exciting dynamic 
to it than the wilderness he says the wilderness is 
predictable the mountains are always there and the rivers 
but the environment in the city is constantly changing i 
believe the challenges posed in the city are far greater 
for every reason outward bound belongs in the wilderness it 
belongs here as well

editors note in celebrating his recent reelection canadian

painfully slowly at times a strong sense of 
national pride and identity seems to be emerging in canada 
canadian native kate nelligan recently appeared on stage here en 
route to a bravura performance on broadway in spoils of war 
the actress was making her first professional appearance in 
canada after triumphs elsewhere but she professed surprise that 
anyone would find that quirky fact about her career interesting or 
relevant 
when a new owner purchased the toronto argonauts of the ailing 
canadian football league the local speculation was rampant that he 
was interested not in the club but in the lease for the citys 
spectacular new skydome to bring in a national football league 
franchise 
the sale terms finally were produced to show that he would not 
have any such rights to the stadium even if the argonauts folded 
canada the worlds second largest country has its complexes 
when prime minister brian mulroney emerged in his hometown of 
baiecomeau quebec for a resounding victory celebration after the 
nov 21 election he spoke of a new canada that was proud of its 
abilities and ready to compete internationally 
by contrast this is what canadian media expert marshall mcluhan 
who died in 1980 wrote to thenprime minister pierre trudeau in 
1968 
canada is the only country in the world that has never had a 
national identity in an age when all homogeneous nations are losing 
their identity images through rapid technological change canada 
alone can keep its cool the campaign was fought over such 
issues of national identity and purpose summed up in the question 
of whether canada should go ahead with the freetrade agreement with 
the united states signed by mulroney and president reagan in january 
1988 
the election outcome with a second consecutive majority 
government for mulroneys progressive conservative party cleared the 
way for the trade agreement 
the election brought canada an unusual amount of attention 
internationally something of a surprise to most canadians who 
routinely say their country is of only limited interest to the 
world it also served domestically as a rare episode of intensive 
debate and soulsearching 
perhaps the greatest surprise was the pride both camps felt in 
canada 
for mulroney and the profree traders canada was a land of 
competence and hard work ready to take on competitors in the united 
states without the protection of tariffs despite being outnumbered 
nearly 10 to one 
for antifree traders canada was a caring country and unbridled 
market forces seen here as being american could threaten its 
traditions of generosity and protection for its people 
no line brought greater applause to liberal party leader john 
turner who ran a fervent campaign against the free trade agreement 
than when he roared when you walk into a canadian hospital they 
dont check your credit card before they check your pulse 
a certain smugness could be noted in canadians running down their 
list of concerns about too much contact with the united states from 
the cleanliness of canadian cities and lower crime rates to their 
belief that government exists to take care of and provide services 
for its citizens 
the l word for liberal that is buried so often in us 
politics is nothing to be feared in canada indeed the comparable 
word game played here is to point out that the emphasis in 
progressive conservative party should be on progressive 
although free trade overwhelmed all other issues this fall one 
of the major controversies expected in the coming months is about 
the governments role in providing child daycare 
writer and popular historian pierre berton believes geography and 
history have created a firm identity in canada and too much has been 
made of a national inferiority complex

we are a different kind of people than the americans he said 
in an interview adding that he opposed the freetrade agreement 
because of its potential threat to national identity and culture 
peter newman a senior columnist for the national news weekly 
macleans said the fall election was the most heated race in 
generations and predicted that its impact will linger 
what we already have is a very precious thing he said in a 
phone interview from british columbia we like what we have here 
and we want to keep it 
the youthfulness of canadian institutions plays a key role in 
national perceptions 
the nation dates to 1867 when its four original provinces joined 
but british colonial institutions lingered far longer the maple 
leaf flag was adopted in 1964 and the last vestiges of colonial 
status were eliminated with the passage of the constitution act of 
1982 
the conference room at the ottawa headquarters of heritage 
canada a national nonprofit organization formed with government 
support in 1973 is decorated with paintings from each of the 
countrys regions 
the scenes are impressive and picturesque from an ornate 
courtyard in the city of quebec to a small town in ontario to homes 
built during the gold rush in the yukons dawson city 
let us celebrate our diversity constance johnson the 
organizations spokeswoman cheerfully told a visitor but it 
sounds more like coping at the moment were not quite ready to 
celebrate 
canadians like to emphasize that they chose instead of the 
americanstyle melting pot to retain a cultural mosaic adding in 
dozens of immigrant societies to the basic english and french 
differences and their persistent tensions 
there also is great interest in the vast sparsely populated 
northern portions of canada as a contributor to national identity 
few have seen the cliffs of baffin or the eskers of the tundra 
but we all live cheek by jowl with the wilderness and all of us i 
think feel the empty and awesome presence of the north berton 
wrote in his book why we act like canadians 
the bulk of the canadian population of 26 million lives in cities 
and towns stretched from the atlantic coastal provinces to british 
columbia on the pacific most not more than 200 miles from the us 
border 
with or without the freetrade agreement the 150 billion annual 
exchange between canada and the united states already is remarkable 
as the largest twoway trading relationship in the world 
each is the others no 1 trading partner but canadians complain 
that they are ignored by the united states and expect that to happen 
again now that the uproar over free trade has subsided 
i think the americans will overlook us as they always do 
newman said unless you make some noise they just take it for 
granted 
canadian economic growth fueled by trade mostly with the 
united states has lasted and at times boomed during the past six 
years 
the parisbased organization for economic cooperation and 
development says growth was 425 percent for 1988 trailing only 
japans 575 percent growth rate among the group of seven industrial 
democracies the forecast was for a decline to 3 percent growth in 
1989 
the governments statistics canada found that canadians standard 
of living was 90 percent of that in the united states through much 
of this decade 
the economist john kenneth galbraith a native canadian who left 
to go to graduate school more than half a century ago once wrote 
that canada has nothing to fear from too much trade with the united 
states 
the american influence is there noone can doubt but it is a 
fact of geography not trade he wrote in the 100th anniversary 
edition of the monthly saturday night magazine those canadians 
who really fear american influence should insist on another location 
it is what one also tells the poles

canada the nation of 26 million people is the worlds second

provinces the most populous being englishspeaking ontario trailed 
by frenchspeaking quebec and two territories the economy has 
grown steadily since the recession of 198182

the agreement us president ronald reagan and prime minister 
brian mulroney signed the agreement jan 2 1988 it eliminates any 
remaining tariffs between the countries over a 10year period 
dismantles many investment barriers frees up trade in energy and 
services and creates canadianus panels to settle disputes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
social programs domestic opponents of the agreement charge that 
canadian social programs such as medicare unemployment insurance 
and pensions ultimately will be affected by the need to compete on 
an equal footing supporters maintain social programs are unaffected 
by the agreement and protected by international trade law 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
employment supporters forecast as many as 250000 new jobs in 
canada during the first 10 years of the agreement opponents charge 
that canada would pay too high a price under the agreement for a 
relatively small number of lowerpaying jobs in the service sector 
that would be created by increased trade 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
energy and natural resources the united states would gain 
nondiscriminatory access to canadian energy supplies opponents 
argue this could lead to canada losing control of its vast energy 
water and other natural resources and being reduced to a source of 
raw materials for the us market supporters maintain the agreement 
means canadian energy exports will no longer face the future threat 
of us trade sanctions that could limit sales and that canada still 
would control its resources in the event of shortages 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the future opponents of the trade agreement paint a grim 
picture of canada losing control of its economic future and say 
political sovereignty could suffer as a result of the agreement 
they say canada already is too dependent on the united states as a 
customer and should develop markets in other countries instead 
supporters say access to the larger us market must be guaranteed 
to ensure future canadian prosperity they argue that without the 
agreement canada risks becoming an isolated international backwater 
the smallest industrial nation without participation in a larger 
trading bloc

the forces that fought the freetrade agreement 
with the united states say they have no intention of giving up on 
the issue despite their election loss to prime minister brian 
mulroney 
there is a continuing trade agenda before us tony clark 
director of the procanada network said in an interview i think 
it boils down to how much more political and economic depending can 
canada take on the greatest economic power in the world 
the coalition of some 20 national organizations including church 
groups environmentalists and womens groups was formed in 1987 to 
battle the trade agreement 
its publicity especially a comic book outlining the trade 
issues was among the most visible during the campaign that ended 
nov 21 with a majority government for mulroneys progressive 
conservative party 
that cleared the way for the trade agreement he signed in january 
1988 with us president ronald reagan to proceed but the opponents 
plan to keep dramatizing the changes they believe it will force on 
canada 
clarke said the activist groups that form the antifree trade 
coalition met again after the election and pledged to continue for 
what we call the long haul of at least the next four or five years 
there was credible commitment and resolve to continue he 
said 
the greatest concern during the campaign focused on the impact 
that the trade agreement could have on canadas more extensive 
network of health and social programs 
the antifree traders plan to put the spotlight on any incidents 
in which they believe the government backs away from its pledge that 
programs wont be affected 
also getting attention will be any workers who lose their jobs as 
a result of the trade agreement 
the supporters of free trade forecast a net increase of as many 
as 250000 jobs over 10 years but concede that some plants will be 
closing as business and industry restructures to serve a wider north 
american market 
many of the questions about what constitutes government subsidies 
remain to be decided in uscanadian negotiations over the next 
several years 
the battle is not over mel hurtig publisher of the 
canadian encyclopedia and a vocal opponent of the agreement said 
in a phone interview from edmonton alberta we consider that 
were bloodied and bruised but weve only lost one major battle in 
the war 
the majority government that mulroney won means there wont be 
another election for about four years but antifree traders predict 
that the issue once again will be the dominant one in the next 
campaign

hoist a frothy stein to siebel institute of 
technology brewmaster u where all the students strive for 
better beer 
i would call it the harvard of the brewmaster schools says 
recent graduate james whilt timper of belleville ill 
since 1901 excluding prohibition of course the siebel institute 
has been turning out many of the worlds brewmasters who create the 
beer thats quaffed at the corner tap 
the people at siebels have my highest admiration its unique 
in the country says michael lewis a professor of brewing science 
at the university of californiadavis 
and the graduation pictures that hang on the second floor carry 
some of the biggest names in suds john w stroh jr class of 59 
august a busch iii class of 61 august pabst class of 67 
siebel institute is an arm of je siebel sons co whose roots 
date to 1868 when the city of chicagos chief chemist a husky 
german immigrant with a flowing beard started a small laboratory to 
introduce european brewing techniques to the united states 
the north side lab a few feet from the screeching wheels of 
elevated commuter trains moved downtown after world war ii and 
then to its current site among large homes and small industries 
chicagos far northwest side in the 1950s 
in the basement staff scientists have their own microbrewery 
which produces 22 liters of beer a few times a month for research 
purposes 
the twostory brick building modestly bears the name siebel over 
the entrance giving no hint to passersby that the greatgrandsons 
of je siebel sr are now at the helm of a company that trains 
brewmasters and acts as a consultant to breweries big and small 
from guatemala to detroit canada to india 
each fall siebel institute accepts 25 to 30 students for an 
11week course in brewing technology most are employees of 
breweries around the world sent to chicago for classroom and 
laboratory training and then promoted to brewmaster or assistant 
brewmaster when they return 
all expenses tuition hotel and food are normally paid by the 
students brewery 
the 5650 course is divided into eight subjects raw materials 
brewhouse theory fermentation storage packaging quality control 
laboratory and taste 
while there are many brewing academies in europe especially west 
germany the siebel institute has few peers in the united states 
the university of californiadavis offers undergraduate degrees in 
food science with an emphasis on brewing but the chicago school 
says its the only one that takes people from inside the industry 
and turns them into brewmasters 
the school accepts few students who do not have a brewing 
background though some with a fair amount of selfstudy and high 
degree of determination can get through the door says executive 
vice president william r siebel 
what theyre taught here is the theory and the science behind 
malt beverages from the various raw materials to their ultimate use 
in the brewhouse says siebel who cant recall anyone who didnt 
pass the course were not teaching any specific formulas to make 
certain beers at their breweries they use their own formulas the 
art is learned on the job 
to the armchair drinker a beer occasionally might taste bad but 
at siebel institute students are taught to determine if a beer 
tastes fruity skunky burnt or grainy 
its not all work during lunch or after classes students are 
usually found in the secondfloor bierstube where they quiz each 
other about the days lessons or play pool while eating snacks and 
downing mugs of free beer compliments of bigname beer companies 
when you get a student from tasmanian says siebel referring 
to an australian brewery and a novice from california theyre 
going to pick up all kinds of insights 
theyre talking beer all the time 
cynthia l bauer has worked at a stroh brewery plant in van nuys 
calif for four years and was recently promoted to assistant 
brewmaster 
beer she says is a language everyone understands 
you can talk about beer to anybody im not talking about 
hightech lasers she says on the other hand its very 
scientific there are 1000 different ways to skin a cat and 1000 
different ways to make beer thats why were here 
ms bauer 28 was one of two women who graduated in the 
mostrecent class does she feel like a pioneer in an industry 
dominated by men 
whats your image of a brewmaster she replies an old guy 
with a bit of a belly well these guys are retiring moving on 
granted there are not too many women but well make it 
unlike most of his classmates timper 31 is unemployed and 
simply wants to get his foot back into the business he was a 
production worker at stag brewery in southern illinois but it 
closed a few months ago and timper was not transferred 
he had to borrow money for the siebel tuition 
i had a choice stand in a long unruly unemployment line or be 
a student timper says siebel is considered a very good 
steppingstone to further a career or start one it has the market 
cornered this whole thing is a gamble i needed to take

the best advice to americans abroad 
is to keep your hands in your pockets lest you be gravely 
misundstood 
for instance a thumbs up might mean ok or right on to 
you but its an obscene gesture in the middle east 
and the aokay sign of the forefinger and thumb in a circle 
can get you into all kinds of trouble it means money in japan but 
in france it means you think someone is a zero and in malta 
heaven forfend its an invitation to have homosexual sex 
goodness knows how they might take a high five 
thats why capt mike rafferty has his hands full teaching a 
crosscultural communications course at this air force base in the 
florida panhandle hes trying to avoid misunderstandings when 
american servicemen teach foreign military personnel the intricacies 
of us military equipment and procedures 
just when you want to deliver a compliment to a foreign student 
you might be picking a fight 
the fiveday course is taught at the air force special operations 
school the school also offers more specific courses for personnel 
being sent to particular parts of the world such as latin america or 
africa but raffertys class gives troops an insight into cultural 
differences around the world 
for instance patting children on the head may be a sign of 
endearment to an american but in some asian cultures where the top 
of the head is considered the home of the soul its an insult 
in most other cultures the development has been different 
rafferty says noting many have changed little over thousands of 
years in the united states the emphasis is on individual rights 
in other cultures its the survival of the group thats important 
this difference shows up in the classroom individualistic 
americans are taught to ask questions figure things out for 
themselves and that their instructors dont know everything says 
rafferty who hails from stockton calif 
in many nonwestern countries students learn by rote and dont 
ask questions or admit they failed to understand something because 
they dont want to be considered different from the rest of the 
group 
we have a saying in this country that the squeaky wheel gets 
the grease rafferty says in asia the saying is the nail 
that stands up gets hammered down 
the individual competitiveness of americans is one of the first 
things foreign students notice rafferty says they often see it as 
a negative factor that takes away from the importance of the group 
other countries tend to stress group competition perhaps refined 
to an ultimate by the japanese rafferty says 
the group emphasis also makes the family more significant in many 
countries in the middle east for example elders are respected 
revered and sought out for advice 
time and space are other important differences 
in arabian african and latin american countries arriving 30 
minutes or more after a meeting was scheduled to start may be 
considered on time while in the united states it would be 
insulting to show up so late rafferty says on the other hand a 
swissgerman would get there early 
while americans feel uncomfortable when others invade their 
space many foreigners particularly arabs and latin americans like 
to get up close and personal 
when that happens to an american at a social function with 
foreigners he is likely to back away but the foreigner again will 
close the gap rafferty says 
theres a little dance that goes on he says 
samesex touching also is common in the middle east and asia 
where it has none of the sexual connotation it has in america 
rafferty recalls a personal experience when attending the 
squadron officer school at maxwell air force base in montgomery 
ala he was good friends with an officer from thailand they played 
on the same soccer team 
while dressed in their soccer shorts they were sitting in the 
stands and talking when the visitor reached over and put his hand on 
raffertys bare thigh 
that was real uncomfortable for me rafferty says 
everybody in the stands behind me was laughing but it wasnt a 
problem 
americans also dont like too much direct eye contact 
particularly between men and women hispanics and arabs who share 
some cultural similarities because of the 700year moorish 
occupation of spain like eye contact 
they feel they can tell a lot about an individual if they can 
look into his eyes rafferty says 
some foreigners get into trouble in the united states when 
strangers interpret their stares as a challenge he says 
foreigners and americans often have stereotyped views of each 
other that are untrue 
the most commonly held view of the united states is that it is 
the great melting pot as a result some foreign visitors are 
surprised when they discover exceptions to racial ethnic and sexual 
equality rafferty says 
often foreigners try to bridge the gap by dressing and acting 
like americans but that can be misleading 
we tend to think he looks like us he must think like us 
too rafferty says thats a big big mistake

don knotts has been reunited with his old pal 
andy griffith on television and you might notice a little of barney 
fife in his new role 
knotts honed his familiar characterization from his earliest days 
in television when he was the tense little man on the steve allen 
show he twitches and fidgets and speaks in a voice that rises in 
nervous inflections 
then in the 1960s on the andy griffith show he won five emmys 
as deputy barney fife the bumbling lawman with childish pretensions 
and a nervous tic the character got another incarnation as ralph 
furley the bombastic landlord on threes company 
now knotts who first teamed with griffith in no time for 
sergeants on broadway and in the film is back with griffith in 
nbcs matlock he plays les calhoun a retiree and 
selfdescribed king of plastics who moves in next door to ben 
matlock the crimesolving southern lawyer played by griffith 
calhoun is a man frequently in trouble because of his inability to 
leave well enough alone 
knotts in person displays none of the hilarious and sometimes 
exasperating mannerisms his voice is soft and his manner is almost 
courtly 
it sure is fun to work with andy again he says in the 
first show we had a chance to sit down and do some of the things we 
used to do in the andy griffith show just talk that was real fun 
i try to keep him different from barney but some of itll 
creep in working with andy its hard to stay away from it and i 
dont know that i should stay totally away 
knotts and griffith had last worked together three years ago in 
the nbc movie return to mayberry a reunion of the gang from 
the andy griffith show

writers strike knotts says he said hed been talking to the 
producers about working me into the show i thought he was kidding 
but he wanted to add something to the show he kept calling 
i was in traverse city mich doing a play he called me again 
after the strike was over and said we need to talk business and i 
realized then that he really meant business i wasnt sure 
when knotts got home from doing the play the first script had 
already been written 
it went through a lot of rewriting he says people dont 
realize it but andy does a lot of rewriting the stuff we had talked 
about he made sure got in there 
knotts quit the andy griffith show at the end of five years 
but returned regularly for guest appearances 
andy said he was going to leave after five years so i said i 
would too he recalls universal offered me a picture deal i 
left but andy changed his mind and stayed i spent five years at 
universal doing one picture a year then i did my variety show on 
nbc but it didnt do very well it did go the full season and after 
that i freelanced i sort of wound up with a picture contract at 
disney they guaranteed me a picture a year 
then came five years on abcs threes company he also did 
half a season as the school principal on the syndicated comedy 
what a country 
knotts grew up in morgantown w va where he was called 
spider because of his wiry build and excelled in basketball and 
wrestling he was attending the university of west virginia when he 
was drafted during world war ii

tony lo bianco gives casting directors not to 
mention audiences fits 
most cant quite remember what he looks like or where they saw 
him before they have seen him as young and old short and tall 
skinny and fat 
he has played gangsters prizefighters communists cowboys 
policemen soldiers in ancient rome longshoremen psychopaths 
baseball players and scores of others in productions by everybody 
from eugene oneill to sylvester stallone 
after critics raved about his performance as the hotheaded eddie 
carbone in the 1983 broadway revival of arthur millers a view 
from the bridge he was offered a lot roles as tough italian 
fathers now hes bracing for a different kind of part 
ill probably get a slew of short fat roles lo bianco says 
the reason 
the actor is starring in hizzoner a oneman show based on 
the life of new york mayor fiorello laguardia and currently on view 
at broadways longacre theater 
now theyll say tony has gone to pot the 52yearold lo 
bianco says hes gotten fat 
and shorter too 
the 5foot9 lo bianco a onetime golden glover plays the 
5foot3 laguardia without losing an inch 
i do it smaller on stage the actor laughs thats the fun 
of it you can appear to shrink 
the actor did gain a little weight for the show but then he has 
also taken off pounds if the role demanded it 
you have to move your body around to conform to what youre 
going to play lo bianco says as an actor you should be a 
marshmallow or a piece of sponge youve got to push your face and 
body around to pay tribute to the script and the character someone 
wrote 
laguardia a nonstop worker was one of new yorks bestknown 
and most colorful mayors during his three terms in office from 
1934 through 1945 he followed fire trucks to fires read the 
funnies over the radio when there was a newspaper strike supervised 
many large building projects including what came to be known as 
laguardia airport and even balanced the citys budget 
the difficulty with playing laguardia who died in 1947 is that 
many people still remember the way he looked and the way he talked 
not only from their own memories but from newsreels old radio 
programs and even tom bosleys tony awardwinning portrayal of him 
in the 1959 musical fiorello 
hizzoner which was written by paul shyre has been in the 
works since 1983 when it was commissioned by a new york public 
television station shyre thought of lo bianco for the role the two 
men had known each other since they worked together in harold 
clurmans acting classes 
it was decided to do hizzoner on stage first so the play 
had several incarnations over the years at regional theaters in 
albany and syracuse before making the trip to new york 
the refinement of the play became a selection process 
youre dealing with a man who was mayor for 12 years and a 
congressman for seven terms so theres a lot to talk about lo 
bianco says 
we wanted to give an understanding of why this man accomplished 
what he accomplished and what in his background made him think the 
way he did what triggered things that made him be the kind of human 
being he was a tremendously honest and caring human being in the 
true sense a public servant in all the books and all the stories 
ive read about him i find no dark shadow in his closet 
lo biancos research took him to the laguardia archives in queens 
to pore over their material and photographs to capture the mans 
expressions he read books about the man as well as laguardias 
autobiography the insurgent 
still it took the actor a while to decide to do the role he 
worried about not only having to capture the mans physical 
mannerisms but the sound of his voice as well 
he would practice the voice every day at home one day when his 
wife came home she thought there was an intruder in the apartment 
it was lo bianco changing into the character 
now before each performance lo bianco listens to various tape 
recordings of laguardias voice to keep in tune with his cadence and 
the high pitch of his voice 
what sold him on the role was the man himself 
he was a human being who cared lo bianco says that kind 
of battler i love 
the play begins on laguardias last day in the mayors office and 
flashes backward to his youth to his days as a lawyer and a 
congressman when he upset the corrupt democratic machine and won 
election as a republican and finally to his election as mayor 
the brooklynborn lo bianco doesnt remember laguardia but 
remembers his father a taxi driver remembering laguardia the 
actor recalls his parents romanticized stories of the tough times 
during the depression and at the center of these troubles was 
laguardia now his own passion for the man is just as fierce 
its a cause the actor says i dont look at doing this 
play as just doing a play its more than that to me what laguardia 
stood for truth honesty and no corruption is something that we 
should all aspire to live in our lives he almost never leaves me i 
feel its as exciting for me to play the role as it was for him to 
be mayor

after 13 years of war peace is a step 
closer in angola and if it comes the nations economic prospects 
could be one of the brightest in africa 
a prolonged period of peace and stable government holds the 
promise of undreamed of prosperity for a people who have known only 
conflict and hardship since winning independence from portugal in 
1975 
angola has abundant reserves of oil iron ore and diamonds many 
of them untapped and a rich soil that could turn it into a 
breadbasket of africa it is about twice the size of texas but has a 
population of only 89 million just a million or so more than new 
york city 
but since independence and the installation of a marxist 
government the country has been embroiled in guerrilla warfare that 
has made development and exploitation of many of its natural 
resources particularly agriculture difficult if not impossible 
rene pellisier a french authority on angola and author of 
several books on the country describes the nations mineral wealth 
as truly astonishing and says it should insure a viable 
economy provided that the country can find investment technical 
skill and can recover its internal peace 
even before independence angola had been disrupted by an 
antiportuguese guerrilla war since 1961 in 1975 the 
antiportuguese guerrilla organizations split along ideological 
lines the marxist angolan popular liberation movement took power in 
luanda and the prowestern national union for total independence of 
angola also known as unita went into the bush to fight 
the marxist government won the support of the soviet union which 
has provided military supplies and advisers and cuba which sent in 
troops unitas main support came from the united states and south 
africa 
the war has reached a virtual stalemate and on dec 22 angola 
cuba and south africa agreed to a phased withdrawal of 50000 cuban 
troops in exchange south africa agreed to grant independence to 
namibia on angolas southern border 
unita has vowed to continue its fight but there are signs of 
negotiations that could bring an internal settlement 
should peace come and stable government take hold the way will 
be open for angola to prosper as few other african nations can 
angolas oil sector is the largest in subsaharan africa after 
nigeria and conservative estimates put known reserves at 184 
billion barrels 
the 375000 barrels a day pumped mainly by an angolanus 
consortium off the cabinda enclave near the mouth of the congo river 
account for 90 percent of angolas export earnings 
under the portuguese angola exported 5 to 8 percent of the 
worlds diamond production and was africas secondlargest coffee 
producer 
proven reserves of a billion tons of highgrade hematite iron ore 
remain in the cassinga mines in southern angola where invading south 
african forces turned much of the area into a nomans land 
diplomats and international aid officials say that with the 
signing dec 22 of agreements by angola cuba and south africa a 
fresh start could be at hand 
were hoping that people who have seen angola as a nogo 
proposition will come here and see some optimism said kieran j 
ocuneen head of the european economic communitys development 
program the largest in angola 
foreign experts government officials and local expatriate 
entrepreneurs all recognize that the obstacles to development are 
enormous peace in the countryside and production centers is 
considered imperative if reconstruction is to begin 
unita is not party to the december agreements in which the 
united states played a thirdparty role says it will not lay down 
its arms until the marxist government of president jose eduardo dos 
santos in luanda agrees to meet at the negotiating table 
the united states which conditions its recognition of dos 
santos government on a settlement with unita and the complete 
withdrawal of cuban troops still is giving unita 15 million a year 
in military aid 
south africa says it stopped its aid to unita following the 
december accords but angolas defense minister pedro maria tonha 
claims south african supplies continue to arrive at unita bases in 
the southeastern part of the country 
the cuban troops are to be out of angola by july 1991 as of jan 
15 about 3000 had left the country 
dos santos recently called for a ceasefire with unita and has 
offered a yearlong amnesty beginning feb 4 
but the 52yearold moscoweducated petroleum engineer says unita 
leader jonas savimbi portrayed by some as a prowestern crusader 
against the marxist government is a special case and must be dealt 
with separately 
in early january before his inauguration president bush wrote 
to savimbi assuring him of continued us support president kenneth 
kaunda of zambia called on bush to offer political asylum to the 
54yearold unita chief who enjoys strong conservative backing in 
the us congress 
outside experts say neither side can hope for a clear victory 
continued clashes between the two sides since midjanuary have 
claimed a reported 200 lives 
foreign aid officials say the threat of continued unita attacks 
prevents them from making surveys to determine how much money will 
be needed to underwrite key projects such as the rehabilitation of 
the lobito corridor 
the corridor includes the strategic benguela railway running from 
the atlantic port of lobito into the heart of africa and the copper 
mines of neighboring zaire and zambia 
most of the 809mile railroad has been out of commission for 
years because of blown up bridges track damage and a lack of 
security 
european economic community officials said following an aiddonor 
conference jan 2627b in luanda on the lobito corridor that 20 
million had been earmarked for the project whose final cost is 
estimated at 600 million 
angola which is expected to join the united nationsaffiliated 
international monetary fund in june has a 4billion foreign debt 
threequarters of it to the soviet union mainly for military 
equipment and salaries to soviet advisers 
the imf is expected to demand at least a 100 percent devaluation 
of angolas currency the kwanza as a condition for membership but 
such a move could throw into turmoil the vital but fragile local 
business structure much of it run by foreigners with assests in 
black market kwanzas 
since independence the official value of the kwanza has been 
pegged at 2962 to the dollar but the black market rate of 2200 is 
the common denominator in nearly all unofficial transactions 
fighting in the countryside has disrupted agricultural production 
and distribution the only way to get agricultural produce to luanda 
from the relatively unscathed southwestern corner of the country is 
by weekly boat from the port of namibe 
once an exporter of food angola received 187000 tons of 
emergency food aid in 198788 
since the internal guerrilla war broke out in 1975 more than 60 
percent of what angola spends on imports has been for military 
supplies 
not much has been left to invest in infrastructure education 
health care and agricultural and industrial development

west german leaders have declared a new 
readiness to improve economic ties with poland but the german help 
for the beleaguered nation hinges on settlement of emotional issues 
smoldering since world war ii 
during a recent visit to bonn by premier mieczyslaw f rakowski 
of poland chancellor helmut kohl announced that it was his 
political goal to visit poland this year the 50th anniversary 
of the invasion of poland by adolf hitlers troops which began 
world war ii 
officials said president richard von weizsaecker of west germany 
could also visit poland this year perhaps on the sept 1 the day 
in 1939 that the germans invased 
weizsaecker a respected statesman known for his eloquent calls 
for west germans to face up to the nazi past served as an 
infantryman in the invading army 
aides to weizsaecker say the president believes such a visit 
would be an important symbolic gesture of reconciliation that 
could cap efforts begun by willy brandt the former socialist 
chancellor who in 1970 knelt in penance before the memorial to 
victims of the warsaw ghetto uprising 
during his visit to bonn rakowski made it clear poland wants 
economic help in return for concessions on several longstanding 
disputes 
he appealed to government and industry leaders for concrete 
support and understanding in decreasing polands 39billion 
foreign debt 
relations between warsaw and bonn have stagnated in recent years 
in large part because of polands economic decline and intransigence 
on both sides in dealing with the ethnic and legal legacy of 
germanys loss of terrorities after its defeat in world war ii 
lack of movement in polish relations has been a nagging foreign 
policy disappointment for kohls coalition government which has 
built on earlier agreements with other east european countries and 
considerably expanded its political economic and cultural ties in 
the region 
the human suffering and devastation inflicted on poland during 
the war and the forced expulsion of thousands of germans from east 
prussia and other territories after 1945 also continues to haunt 
relations east prussia is now part of poland and the soviet union 
there are many on both sides who still harbor a deep sense of 
bitterness and mistrust said eberhard schulz an expert on west 
germanpolish affairs with the bonnbased german foreign policy 
institute 
because of our history our postwar relations with poland 
have always been a delicate matter said claus wunderlich a 
spokesman for the west german foreign ministry 
kohls chief foreign policy adviser horst teltschik has been 
assigned to meet with polish leaders to clear the way for the 
chancellors visit 
financial officials will work on a package of economic aid to 
help rescue polands deteriorating economy and representatives of 
other bonn ministries will try to resolve cultural and ethnic 
issues government sources said 
in return west germany wants warsaw to acknowledge the existence 
of an ethnic german minority in poland and to allow its members to 
keep their heritage alive 
bonn also wants polish leaders to allow official documents such 
as birth certificates to list both the polish and former german 
names of cities in terrorities ceded to poland after the war 
the documents issue goes to the heart of a tangled postwar legal 
legacy that has preoccupied bonn and irritated warsaw 
under the terms of a 1970 treaty west germany renounced its 
claim to vast tracts of former german territory incorporated into 
poland at the end of the war 
the treaty also recognized polands western border with communist 
east germany 
however the west german parliament in a joint declaration two 
years later emphasized that the treaty created no legal basis for 
the borders 
the nations constitutional court later upheld the declaration 
and ruled that germanys 1937 boundaries still applied in 
determining legal issues such as citizenship and claims against the 
former german reich 
it also forms the legal foundation for possible future border 
realignment discussions in the event germany is one day reunited 
the decision angered the polish government at the time and 
remains a sore point although the west german government has 
repeatedly stated that territorial claims agreed to in the treaty 
are not at issue 
under kohls conservative leadership bonn officials have taken 
great pains to assuage those suspicions and bonn officials say 
rakowskis government has signaled that most of these disputes can 
be settled the spokesman for the polish foreign ministry stefan 
staniszewski said in late january that issues which have been 
open until now will be solved 
but west german officials say privately that coming up with an 
acceptable economic package in return will be difficult 
while the west german government has indicated its readiness to 
work out new debt restructuring agreements with poland finance 
officials say they are not eager to risk massive new credits 
warsaw is having trouble repaying a 1billionmark 546million 
credit made in 1975 and wants west germany to agree to repayment in 
zlotys the polish currency which could be used for new german 
projects in poland 
meanwhile west german officials are working to avoid the 
suggestion of a potentially embarrassing linkage between symbolic 
gestures of conciliation during the anniversary year and financial 
assistance to warsaw which the respected frankfurt allgemeine 
newspaper bluntly described as reconciliation in exchange for the 
influx of capital 
our relations with poland are far too complex to reduce them to 
the onedimensional contention that we will only achieve 
improvements with a fat check in our hand said foreign minstry 
spokesman wunderlich 
but government officials believe bonns economic clout carries 
almost overwhelming leverage in gaining concessions 
in the final sober analysis said one they need us more 
now than we need them

the scandanavians are unsurpassed at filming epic dramas against 
the harsh beauty of northern landscapes ingmar bergman has proved 
the master of such films other contributions have included jan 
troells the emigrants and the new land about swedish 
farmers in minnesota bo wilderbergs elvira madigan and last 
years academy award winner babettes feast 
now pelle the conqueror joins that select group written and 
directed with rare skill by danish filmmaker bille august it is an 
impressive achievement austere yet reachable sorrowful but 
elevating for the soul the film displays max von sydow at the peak 
of his talent its hard to imagine any of the worlds actors 
performing the role with such conviction 
pelle the conqueror a confusing title suggesting arnold 
schwarzenwegger in loincloth is based on the first volume of the 
famed saga by martin andersen nexo the story is told through the 
eyes of pelle pelle hvenegaard a subteen swedish boy who 
accompanies his widower father lasse max von sydow on a perilous 
adventure early in the century seeking a new life in the danish 
farm country 
their arrival portends the grimness of their future the farm 
owners hire ablebodied immigrants dismissing lasse as too old and 
his son as too young finally the brutal manager of the stone farm 
agrees to take on the pair 
pelle finds his new home both thrilling and forbidding like most 
outsiders he is reviled and beaten by his schoolmates but he is 
intrigued by drama all around him the free spirit who challenges 
the foreman and pays for it the womanizing landowner who is 
periodically tainted by the mother of his outofwedlock child the 
longsuffering landowners wife who bestows kindness on pelle and 
savage retribution on her husband 
the boy also watches with growing sorrow his fathers frustration 
with his mean existence every hope that lasse uncovers turns to 
dust when he finds a woman who could make a home for him and the 
boy her husband believed lost at sea returns despairing of his 
luck and ashamed of his cowardice he turns to drink 
this brief resume might sound depressing but pelle the 
conqueror isnt augusts script is laden with surprises some 
funny some thrilling and his camera captures the raw grandeur of 
the danish countryside 
von sydow has never performed more impressively his lasse is 
downtrodden yet somehow noble a man befuddled by his inability to 
make a better life for himself and his son young hvenegaard who 
never acted before is miraculous his bright face mirrors the 
wondrous things he sees 
released in this country by mirimax films pelle the 
conqueror is subtitled in english there is no rating running

defense of the realm nelson home entertainment vhsbeta 
rated r 
 
like the whistleblower an equally tidy little thriller 
defense of the realm is long on atmosphere its worth the 
rental if only to see how a another western democracy has its own 
dirty obsessions with state secrets 
gabriel byrne plays the reporter who tumbles to the big story 
after an old sot of a colleague denholm elliott stumbles onto it 
first and dies mysteriously apparently for a secret the shadow 
government thinks is worth killing him to protect 
its effective to see the young reporter start to pull at the 
ends of the story until a strand works loose then put the strands 
of the story together until finally 
ah but that would be telling eh 
some might fault the movies abrupt ending but lets admonish 
these curmudgeonly souls with the old 60s epigram it aint

living years atlantic mike the mechanics 
 
no doubt there is sincerity in the lyrics of in the living 
years a song cowritten by mike rutherford and ba robertson not 
long after their fathers died unfortunately there is little 
originality in its description of the communication gap between 
father and son its too late when we die to admit we dont see 
eye to eye and when the music swells for the refrain and a 
childrens choir joins in it sounds uncomfortably like another 
artists for trendy causes benefit project 
aside from that overdose of feeling the most striking feature of 
this second album by genesis guitarist mike rutherfords other band 
is that there is nothing very striking about it the tunes are 
catchy the production is smooth the overall sound is perfectly 
listenable and the lyrics contain simple easytounderstand 
messages nobodys perfect love is worth believing in a poor 
boy deserves a break 
theres a lifeisbeautifulbecausewereinlove song and a 
toobadwecouldntmakelovelast song each is pleasant to listen 
to each is easy to hum along with each sounds vaguely as though 
youve heard it before 
paul carrack best known from squeeze and paul young from sad 
cafe share the lead vocal duties their voices blend together well 
enough to give the band a recognizable sound and the differences in 
their styles are used to good advantage to match the lyrics 
all the songs are well put together and could easily become hits 
catchy smooth listenable pleasant hummable hits nothing wrong 
with that unless by chance youre tired of 80s music and looking 
for something new

cgp columbia chet atkins 
 
chet atkins despite his enormous talent and legendary status 
among guitarists has made a fair number of dull albums in his long 
career cgp is another one of them 
on most of the songs atkins sounds content to lay back and 
pleasantly pick through a selection of light pseudojazz 
arrangements its backround music a soundtrack of your last visit 
to an office waiting room 
the atkinsmark knopfler duet on imagine says a lot about the 
album the combination has enticing potential but the two 
guitarists approach the john lennon song in such an easygoing 
gentlemanly manner as if each one is politely waiting for the other 
to take off that it never gets off the ground 
more successful are jethreaux in which atkins snappy 
playing proves that easylistening doesnt have to mean 
sleepinducing and put your clothes on featuring some lovely 
interplay between atkins and fiddler johnny gimble 
atkins also delivers a heartfelt vocal on the plaintive i still 
cant say goodbye in which the singer recalls his late father 
the title of the album is an acronym for certified guitar player 
which atkins certainly is but on cgp the music rarely rises 
above that of a por pretty ordinary record

victory day rca tom cochrane amp red rider 
 
victory day is a record filled with intelligent lyrics about 
alienation and resiliency unfortunately the creativity reflected 
in the lyrics is missing from most of the music which sounds like a 
generic imitation of springsteen john cougar mellencamp and bryan 
adams 
the album is the sixth from the canadian sextet tom cochrane amp 
red rider songwriter cochranes way with words is apparent from the 
opening cut big league sung by a father whose plans for his 
son are ruined by a car wreck also stirring is the title cut about 
a girl who tries to temper her boyfriends dreams of grandeur by 
arguing that life is about small moments all strung together 
ironically while cochrane ventures beyond the ordinary when 
choosing the subjects he sings about most of the guitardominated 
arrangements on victory day are utterly predictable one 
exception is good man feeling bad a simple ballad that allows 
a great bass line and cochranes singing to carry the song 
most of the other cuts are uptempo but the band sounds 
restrained and a little stiff its evident that tom cochrane amp red 
rider have talent cochrane sings with a certain swagger and the 
band sparkles occasionally such as on the soaring guitar break of 
sons beat down but next time the guys should cut loose and take 
a few chances

for an actor who starred in the two most 
controversial movies in the past years willem dafoe remains 
remarkably cool 
dafoes career exploded two years ago with platoon which won 
him an academy nomination and elevated him from a littleknown 
character actor to fullfledged star last year he found himself at 
the center of a firestorm of protest over the last temptation of 
christ in which he portrayed jesus christ 
now dafoe is starring with gene hackman as two fbi agents of 
differing styles in mississippi burning a fictional account of 
the investigation of the murders of three civil rights workers in 
the turbulent 1960s black leaders and have assailed the film for 
overlooking black participation in the civil rights struggle and 
others who took part in or reported the events have decried the 
alleged distortion of history and the glorification of the fbi 
director alan parker and others associated with the orion 
pictures movie have emphasized its fictional nature during a recent 
visit to los angeles dafoe who lives in new york declined to be 
drawn into the controversy but he did reflect on his participation 
in two headlined movies 
theres no clever anecdote about mississippi burning i just 
read the script and responded to it he said i was aware of 
the civil rights struggle in 1964 when i was nine years old i 
dont remember the actual event but i do remember a lot of trouble 
in the south 
then in 1968 i remember being very conscious even by reading 
the newspapers at 13 and growing up very comfortably of the feeling 
that the world was coming apart that was the time of richard specht 
and the murder of those nurses in chicago and the assassinations 
of martin luther king and robert kennedy so its an era that i 
dont really know firsthand because i wasnt an adult but i think 
it points to things that were concerned with today 
mississippi burning was filmed in the same general area where 
the events took place 
we got a surprising amount of support from the people down 
there said dafoe i think some people particularly in our 
locations in mississippi were eager to cooperate with us kind of 
as a gesture to let people know that things had in fact changed 
but certainly there were people who commonly said why do you 
want to bring these things up again its over 
why indeed bring these things up again 
i dont know im not so good at lessons but i think the 
bottom line is sure we can remember things by having this 
presented to us again remember it is fiction but it is based on 
the shelby county murders 
volunteers from around the country were invited to take part in 
the freedom summer to help register black voters in segregated 
mississippi one was 20yearold andrew goodman a student at queens 
college on sunday june 21 goodman and two members of core 
congress of racial equality michael schwerner and james chaney 
were driving to the town of lawndale where a black church had been 
burned 
they were stopped for speeding near philadelphia and jailed for 
several hours after being released that night the workers 
disappeared their bodies were discovered aug 4 on a farm outside 
of philadelphia 
dafoes engagement for the last temptation of christ seems 
equally as casual as his appearance in mississippi burning 
returning from the thailand locations for off limits he was 
summoned to a meeting with martin scorsese after talking to the 
director and reading the script i knew pretty much right then and 
there that we were going to do this together 
the actor realized the perils of portraying jesus on the screen 
and that it was a work that was bound to arouse the wrath of 
fundamentalists 
but a mans gotta do what hes gotta do dafoe said with a 
chuckle i felt like i was the right person to do that role sure 
i knew that the book was controversial and i knew there had 
been a rough history of trying to get this film done 
i must say i was surprised by how the protest manifested 
itself i didnt think the controversy was really going to happen 
maybe i was just putting it out of my mind because i had some work 
to do and that was the important thing 
dafoe was born in appleton wis and had an early ambition to 
act in films that may have started when he sat through three 
screenings of gone with the wind from morning to night he 
dropped out of high school to join milwaukees avantgarde theater 
x then settled in new york to work with the wooster group with 
which he is still associated 
his early films streets of fire to live and die in la 
usually cast him as a delinquent or killer but oliver stone saw 
something benign in the young actor and cast him as the almost 
saintly sgt elias in platoon he has since starred in three 
films but he says that the pace hasnt been too fast 
nothings ever too fast he laughed ive been working a 
long time actually ive been a theater actor since i was 18 years 
old still am ive been making pictures since 1980 
sure things change life is different more things are 
available to me certainly i have a higher profile but so far it 
hasnt bitten back its only been good really

the pulitzer prizewinning composer ellen taaffe 
zwilich was commissioned to create a new music piece for the chicago 
symphony because two trombone players wanted her 
sir georg solti will conduct concerto for trombone and 
orchestra when the symphony premieres it this month 
the orchestra has a very fine first trombonist jay friedman 
and now has a wonderful bass trombone player charles vernon they 
both asked for me i love the instrument and i think its a 
wonderful solo instrument with a very small repertoire said 
zwilich the only woman ever to be awarded a pulitzer for music 
to me its an instrument that should have the stature of the 
violin or piano as a soloist so i was thrilled its nice to feel 
youre making a contribution 
when it came to composing zwilich said what i decided to do 
was write very different pieces the one for tenor trombone is very 
interactive with the orchestra 
the other that im working on is for bass trombone and 
strings and very little percussion it is less interactive and more 
brilliantly virtuosic the piece will be premiered next season 
her first symphony won the pulitzer prize for music in 1983 
zwilich who is 49 played violin for seven years in the american 
symphony she played trumpet in school and has had experience with 
each family of instruments she didnt play trombone 
i think one of the wonderful things thats available to a 
composer today is the good advice of musicians you respect she 
said in an interview 
both jay and charlie have had very strong impact on the pieces 
i was writing for them ive sat down with them with and without 
instruments we talk on the telephone someone who spends his or her 
life playing an instrument always has insights the outsider can 
never have 
i also sat down with solti we talked about other peoples 
music for trombone and orchestra and he told me what he thought the 
problems were 
the new york philharmonic premiered zwilichs symbolon last 
june in the soviet union its the first american composition to be 
premiered there this season the philharmonic will perform that 
work and the composers concerto grosso 1985 at lincoln center 
based on a theme of handel it was commissioned by the washington 
friends of handel 
zwilich went on the philharmonic tour she relates that one 
soviet man said he was surprised to hear a powerful piece composed 
by a woman the translator sort of giggled she as well as i 
thought it was quaint however zwilich said americans also are 
sometimes surprised that women composers would have what might be 
considered a powerful statement to make 
as the trombone concerto was composed for a particular player and 
orchestra symbolon was tailored for its debut 
two things were uppermost in my mind she said one was 
that i wanted it to be a piece that would exploit the new york 
philharmonics virtuosity i wrote a bass solo because the principal 
contrabass player is from leningrad 
the fact it was going to receive its premiere in the soviet 
union was very touching to me i knew the piece would reflect the 
powerful and sometimes conflicting emotions that i have about the 
current world political situation 
its a piece of music people can listen many different ways 
its not a piece where i think its necessary to know the 
background the title is an old greek term which refers to two 
parties breaking something in two and each keeping half the 
implication is that its a token of friendship and good will there 
is a sense of needing the other to complete things 
if elements of russian music crept into symbolon zwilich 
didnt stop it i left that to the unconscious i really just 
focused on writing a piece 
two recordings of zwilich music will be released soon the new 
york philharmonic recorded symbolon concerto grosso 1985 
and concerto for trumpet and five players conducted by zubin 
mehta and double quartet for strings conducted by the 
composer for new world records the louisville symphony recorded 
her second symphony for louisville heritage records 
the experience i have as a composer is something i can sit down 
and talk about with a poet painter or writer and were at the same 
level of understanding zwilich said you have techniques you 
master you have goals to focus on some days are better than 
others it is a process that involves all of you 
its a process in which youre doing something youve never 
done before even though youve done that type of thing before its 
like sailing out into the ocean without an absolutely clear course 
thats very exciting and a lot of fun it has difficulties and 
terrors too 
zwilich was born in miami has bachelors and masters degrees in 
composition from florida state university and was the first woman to 
receive a doctorate in composition from the juilliard school 
as soon as i could climb up to the keyboard i did and started 
to press down she said i always knew i would be a musician at 
the earliest stage i was making music for myself then i began to 
make music for other people then for other people to play my life 
has been one that came more and more into focus where composing 
became more and more important to me to the point where about 10 
years ago i stopped playing and teaching music theory 
zwilich met her husband violinist joseph zwilich in a 
restaurant after she had performed with the american symphony and he 
had played in the metropolitan opera orchestra he died in 1979 
she composes in the mornings and after 2 pm turns to meetings 
proofreading scores for publication writing program notes 
as to whether her music is melodic zwilich said im 
interested in the long line but i am a 20th century person there 
are things i think are melodies that people who only know italian 
opera would not recognize as such

more i asked ben if he would introduce me to some jazz players 
thats milt jackson playing vibes on born to be blue phil 
woods plays solo on when sunny gets blue and red top i think 
red top is going to be the most popular song on the record 
later after some live dates with sidran miller redid some vocals 
and strings were added 
born to be blue was difficult miller said because he had to 
run scales and practice its a mel torme tune i tried to make 
things seem seamless and effortless it was a real job i found out 
how great mel is 
miller had early musical roots his mother was from a musical 
family and one of his uncles played violin in paul whitemans 
orchestra and another uncle played guitat his father a doctor and 
tape recorder fanatic was best man at les paul and mary fords 
wedding when miller was 5 the couple showed him guitar licks and 
harmonizing 
i wanted to be les paul miller said 
millers father and tbone walker became friends when i was 
11 tbone taught me how to play guitar behind my head while doing 
the splits i started my first band when i was 12 we played 
intermissions at fraternity dances at southern methodist i taught 
my older brother to play bass so he could drive me to the gigs 
i went to college studied in copenhagen a year started my 
rock n roll career i was too young and too stupid to go back and 
see tbone i wish i had he totally shaped the way i am a pupil of 
tbone walker when i play lead guitar 
miller decided not to get a doctorate in comparative literature 
and instead went to chicago 
my grad work was done at the university of blues on the south 
side of chicago he said i spent two years competing with muddy 
waters howlin wolf junior wells and buddy guy for work in 
nightclubs they tried to steal my gigs and i tried to steal theirs 
we jammed together a lot it was a very healthy blues scene it was 
getting national attention paul butterfield went east and played 
with dylan i heard about what was going on in san francisco i 
headed west 
miller has five platinum albums and according to billboard 
magazine three no 1 singles the joker rock n me and 
abracadabra 
his commercial success is all rock n roll fly like an 
eagle is rock n roll im going to play it in my jazz show itll 
go over great 
miller once spent three years away from the business what i 
did was finish 14 years of touring wed do 11 months a year its 
the way we sold records i had done the world 15 times i had six 
top 10 singles in a row i remember in 1979 walking off a stage from 
an audience of 40000 handing the guitar to an assistant and 
saying i dont care if i ever do this again i was so tired 
nothing was spontaneous 
i was rich i bought a farm in oregon in 1982 i moved to 
seattle and started back to work 
but miller had a difficult time making circle of love he had 
just been divorced from his first wife he has since remarried and 
was not very happy it was not a great album i just had to make a 
record and get going i received a lot of stinging criticism for 
that record he said 
as a reaction i turned around and did abracadabra the no 1 
selling single in the world in 1983 i felt like i can do hit 
singles and im not washed up

the celebrated writer ben hecht once said that 
the persistent banality of the movies is due to the vision of 
their manufacturers 
this he said is usually a man who has no taste to be violated 
or intelligence to be distorted he admires with his whole soul the 
drivel his underlings produce in the factory 
hecht coauthor of that irreverent look at the news business 
the front page and a major screenwriter of the 1930s and 40s 
was assailing the studio bosses who ruled hollywood during its 
golden age 
but the transformation of hollywood from cow town to tinsel town 
could not have happened without such men as adolph zukor louis b 
mayer harry cohn and harry and jack warner they were all 
immigrants jewish immigrants who arrived in this country in the 
late 19th century 
the story is the story of not only jewish immigrants but all 
immigrants said film critic neil gabler author of an empire of 
their own crown 2495 which chronicles the role played by 
jewish immigrants in the rise of hollywood 
these individuals created their own alternate america its not 
particular to just five individuals its particular to 5 million 
zukor was born in hungary in 1873 orphaned at an early age he 
was raised by an uncle who was a rabbinical scholar mayer was born 
in russia around 1885 and would later claim the fourth of july as 
his birthday his father jacob was a peddler unable to keep his 
family out of poverty 
harry and jack warner were born in poland but ended up traveling 
around the united states while their father pursued a career as a 
cobbler they would eventually settle in youngstown ohio harry 
cohn was born in 1891 in new york city the son of a tailor he quit 
school at 14 
they were determined to succeed to break out of the cycle of 
poverty and failure that had marked their childhoods but for a 
jewish immigrant at the turn of the century the options were 
limited 
they couldnt go to most universities gabler noted they 
couldnt enter most professions not even law there were two jewish 
lawyers in all of southern california 
so one by one they drifted into the film business which at the 
time consisted of nickelodeon houses 
some came in by accident zukor wandered into a chicago theater 
in 1897 saw a film of a scene from the broadway hit the widow 
jones and was impressed enough to eventually open his own arcade 
cohn and others were brought into the business by relatives 
the industry began to take hold the following decade as 
nickelodeons gave way to feature films by the 20s movies were big 
business and the jewish immigrants were in charge of the major 
studios zukor headed up paramount the warners formed warner bros 
mayer ran mgm and cohn was in charge of columbia 
but the studios were more than a business for the immigrants 
they were an extension of the moguls own personalities zukor 
identified with sophisticated and smart gabler said and paramount 
specialized in slick romantic comedies such as ernst lubitschs 
trouble in paradise 1932 with herbert marshall and miriam 
hopkins and his the smiling lieutenant 1931 with maurice 
chevalier miriam hopkins and claudette colbert 
the hostile belligerent cohn liked his films tough and columbia 
became the home of the fastpaced comedies of frank capra and howard 
hawks jack and harry warner considered themselves outsiders and 
their studio specialized in gangster films starring actors who put 
the t in tough james cagney and edward g robinson 
mgm was the most hollywood of all the studios with its white 
sound stages nd art deco administration building sentimental films 
such boys town and the andy hardy pictures reaffirmed mayers 
own oldfashioned values it was also the studio that made gone 
with the wind 
those pictures were the fullest expressions of the mayer 
personality gabler said he wanted to be father to the world 
although in a very 19th century patriarchal kind of way he treated 
his actresses that way what are you wearing who are you going 
out with he treated his stars like children 
mayer was benevolent compared to the other studio heads who 
followed cohns motto i dont get ulcers i give em but 
gabler saw underlying reasons for their ruthless style 
out of context harry cohn is a beast if you only look at his 
behavior the same thing may be true of mayer and zukor and 
others gabler said if you look at them as a group if 
individuals who felt the culture was against them then their 
behavior takes a different context 
the ending for most of the studio heads was more shapesperean 
tragedy than hollywood epic by the 50s the immigrants had been 
pushed aside in favor of younger men 
as hollywood became increasingly democratized they were like 
king lear too old to govern its a young mans business for 
people who have the iron will to succeed all these various factors 
contributed to their decline the thing they most feared did happen 
the industry was taken away from them gabler said 
he spent five years writing and researching empire of their 
own he would learn firsthand about the power of the immigrants 
vision after interviewing norma shearer one of mgms biggest 
stars of the 30s and the wife of irving thalberg the studios 
celebrated production head 
gabler and danny selznick the son of producer david o selznick 
visited the actress at the motion picture home in california not 
long before she died 
she was a tiny woman and had no recollection of thalberg 
gabler said after the interview we took her back to her room and 
put her on her bed danny said do you mind if i kiss you and she 
said no not at all she turned her head and said this is my 
good side

three firebrand sisters say twotiming 
men need this advice get lost 
stand by your man not these singing siblings 
the burch sisters are a trio of feisty georgians who give the 
term southern belle a more combative connotation 
discussing the shrinking violet lyrics that women in country 
music often sing cathy burch says im sick to death of you 
have left me so alone its about time somebody said look buddy 
i dont have to put up with this there are too many fishes in the 
sea 
mirroring this assertive attitude was their first single release 
last fall everytime you go outside i hope it rains 
the song is about a brokenhearted woman and her sentiments 
toward her former lover some of the lyrics 
im not going to wish you all the best 
i hope youll be lonesome stay worried and depressed 
in their current record i dont want to mention any names 
they make intimidating remarks at an aggressive woman eyeing their 
man among the lyrics 
shes asked him to slow dance way too often 
shes made suggestions i dont like at all 
finally they warn 
if she dont back up theres going to be some trouble 
this blunt approach comes from cathy charlene and cindy burch 
who offer fresh perspectives on menwomen relationships in their 
first album new fire 
there are a lot of girl groups out there says charlene who 
has worked as a licensed practical nurse the forester sisters are 
fine then youve got the mccarters and the judds but theres 
room the forester sisters sing mostly about home and families the 
mccarters are mostly about love and then ours is look buddy get 
out of my hair 
their road to a recording contract is the grist for a country 
song itself the three pooled hardearned wages of 17000 to go 
into a studio in atlanta and make a demonstration record their 
producer brought it to the attention of mercurypolygram records 
which signed them to a contract in late 1987 
it was a nice christmas present said cindy at age 24 the 
youngest who has worked as a radiology technician for five years 
she said she had little reservation about risking the money 
i wanted to be able to say we did everything possible we 
tried so now we can get married and have our babies she said 
added cathy if we hadnt tried wed have been 60 years old 
sitting on the front porch wondering 
they sing straightahead country music that accents their crisp 
harmonies background instruments are used at a minimum cathy a 
glenn close lookalike sings lead vocals and plays piano but all 
three switch singing parts 
theyve been singing together for as long as they can remember 
they were originally from jacksonville fla born three years 
apart they later moved to screven in southeast georgia where they 
sang at nightclubs fairs and special events 
we were raised on the farm and there was nothing else to do 
cindy said we had to entertain ourselves somehow or wed beat 
each other up singing didnt hurt so bad 
after completing their formal education they pursued separate 
career interests but lived close enough to each other that they 
could continue singing as a trio charlene and cindy entered the 
medical profession while cathy became a licensed cosmetologist and 
hairdresser she also worked in a restaurant and farmed 
none has ever been married but charlene and cindy tease cathy 
about several engagements 
one of the cuts on their album is open arms a song made 
famous by the rock n roll group journey 
weve been singing it for a while cathy said a lot of our 
friends are country country country you can call them rednecks if 
you want to they listen to country and nothing else they dont 
know there are good tunes on the rock n roll stations a friend of 
mine said she loved that song and it gave me the idea

wanted people aged 18 to 29 to take recreational 
drugs as part of a scientific study earn up to 400 in four 
afternoons 
that recent newspaper advertisement is on the up and up its 
part of the quiet battle waged by drug companies and the federal 
government to find ways to curb recreational use of prescription 
drugs 
scientists hire the volunteers to learn what makes some drugs so 
pleasant that they are likely to be abused they hope to use that 
knowledge to develop drugs that are as effective but not 
pleasureable enough for illicit use 
drug companies use the studies to decide whether to market a new 
drug and in what dosages federal agencies use the data to decide 
whether to approve a drug for sale or impose certain restrictions on 
how it may be prescribed 
if the drug made subjects euphoric they are asked whether they 
would take it again for pleasure and how much they would pay for it 
on the street 
the four categories of drugs that cause the most trouble and are 
most scrupulously tested are painkillers diet and sleeping pills 
and antianxiety drugs said dr john j boren of the national 
institute on drug abuse 
drug companies have been trying for years to develop painkillers 
as effective as morphine but not as addictive boren said but 
pharmacologists have been able to invent new sleeping pills that are 
less habitforming than the traditional sort barbituates he said 
abuseproof drugs are medically desirable but they can also be 
immensely profitable since doctors are likely to prescribe them 
with a freer hand 
one such moneymaker is the antianxiety drug buspar which was 
tested in boston by dr jonathan o cole chief of 
psychopharmacology at mclean hospital a psychiatric facility which 
is a harvard university teaching hospital 
the question was cole said gee do people who like 
downers like this stuff 
most of coles volunteers are college students 
when they call up we try to get histories from them of what 
they use and dont use he said but reseachers must be careful 
because wouldbe volunteers tend to offer the medical history they 
think is wanted 
we want people who have taken sedative drugs recently and taken 
them often enough that were reasonably sure nothings going to 
happen to them cole said occasional users and those who appear 
mentally unstable are rejected usually about onethird of the 
applicants are accepted 
for the buspar study cole recruited subjects who had taken 
valium or barbituates for pleasure but seemed stable on four 
different afternoons they were given valium buspar quaaludes or a 
placebo a dummy pill with no effects but were not told which 
they had taken 
the subjects found the quaaludes very euphoric the valium about 
half as euphoric and the buspar not much different from the placebo 
the food and drug administration approved the drug for sale in 
1986 and it is now one of the most successful drugs that 
bristolmyers has ever launched according to the companys janet 
lindholm manager of consumer affairs 
buspar now competes with other antianxiety drugs including 
valium zanax and atavan in a market worth 600 million to 700 
million per year said scott litherland another company spokesman 
sales figures are kept secret but more than 3 million prescriptions 
have been written he said 
bristolmyers uses the fact that it is not likely to make 
patients high as a selling point with physicians 
the best results have been with patients who have never taken 
antianxiety drugs because some longterm patients associate feeling 
less anxious with the sedation and euphoria that drugs like valium 
produce litherland said they can pop a valium and they feel 
better but thats not the antianxiety effect its the side effect 
that they think makes them feel better 
bristolmyers recommends doctors wean such patients from 
sedatives before they prescribe buspar he said 
depending on the type of drug being tested scientists may 
recruit college students prisoners recovered junkies or people in 
methadone programs said frank vocci chief of the drug abuse staff 
of the fda some are regulars 
you will have people who have assorted drug histories wholl 
try to get into every study thats being run vocci said 
they sit around on this little ward and play nintendo and enjoy 
themselves for a week 
in addition to human testing each year about 250 experimental 
drugs are tried on animals to see if they are physically or 
psychologically addictive in one common test monkeys are trained 
to push a lever that injects them with a drug they are then allowed 
to give themselves as many injections as they like on the premise 
that if the monkeys take it so will people 
drugs that flunk may be abandoned unless their benefits outweigh 
their addictive potential they may be subject to restrictions 
including production limits or bans on telephone prescription or 
automatic refills said vocci 
tests also help regulators decide whether to ban or loosen 
controls on drugs that are already approved 
congress banned quaaludes in 1984 after authorities concluded 
they were habitforming and a hit on the black market vocci said 
the drug known by the generic name methaqualone had been under 
tight controls since 1973 
the fda permitted loperamide a diarrhea drug sold under the 
brand name imodium to be sold over the counter after a study in 
which recovered narcotics addicts given up to 30 times the usual 
dose told researchers they did not think what they took was a drug 
vocci said 
if you really do a good job on prevention you never hear of 
this drug again because it never gets introduced to the market 
boren said this is one place where better science and technology 
is paying off without meeting the publics eye

the debate over whether to teach deaf children 
how to speak is unlikely to wane educators say despite a recent 
study showing that reading scores were strongly higher for those 
able to speak 
its a very emotional controversy said jean moog principal 
of central institute for the deaf where the federally funded study 
was done last year i think what were trying to do is bring some 
rationale to the topic 
in the study of 100 profoundly deaf 16 and 17yearold students 
who had been taught speech reading scores were five grade levels 
higher than the thirdgrade nationwide average for profoundly deaf 
students thirty of the 100 read at or above the 10thgrade level 
said ann geers who led the research 
that means they were functioning for all practical purposes 
like normalhearing adolescents which is rather outstanding 
considering the severity of their deafness geers said 
profoundly deaf people even with the most powerful hearing aids 
cannot understand speech without special training though they may 
hear some sounds 
the report has been well received by supporters of teaching the 
deaf to speak but moog said those who favor total communication 
combining speech and sign language are less enthusiastic that is 
used in 90 percent of schools 
the hit movie children of a lesser god dealt with the moral 
question of whether the deaf should be integrated sometimes against 
their will into the speaking world sign language is easier to 
teach than speech but may be of little or no use except among other 
deaf people 
according to helen bayer coordinator of the st louis county 
special school district deaf education program choosing between the 
two extremes and a myriad of choices between depends on factors such 
as intelligence other learning disabilities and family support 
ive enjoyed great success with some profoundly deaf students 
in teaching them to talk and ive interacted with others where it 
was a very painful experience in which their selfconfidence was 
destroyed bayer said 
in the typical total communication program research has shown 
that students depend too much on sign language moog said they 
make noises they vocalize but speech is not intelligible without 
the signs 
deaf children in total communications programs also dont read as 
well because they arent given intensive instruction in speech and 
language geers said if deaf students are to reach their full 
potential they must be taught to speak at an early age before 
signing is learned she said 
to participate in the study teens had to have been profoundly 
deaf before they learned language they had to have been educated in 
an oral setting only and to have a normal iq with no significant 
educational handicaps 
in reading ability moog said what appeared to make the most 
difference was their facility with english the extent to which they 
mastered vocabulary understood syntatic structure and how to form 
complex sentences how to write them how to speak them and how to 
understand them when they were spoken 
of the 20000 profoundly deaf people under age 21 in the united 
states only about 10 percent are taught in oral communication 
programs that emphasize the limited hearing they have lipreading 
and speaking 
if you want deaf children to talk it takes a lot of work on 
speech moog said on average children in a total communication 
program receive two or three halfhour speech lessons a week and 
end up using mostly sign language 
the profound effect will come within the next 10 years when all 
deaf children being educated in total communication programs are not 
talking she said there will be an entire generation of deaf 
children who will be angry that they were not given the instruction 
to talk 
proponents of total communication say that teaching speech takes 
more time and effort and that many preschool children in oralonly 
programs are unable to communicate in any form for a few years 
ive always referred to it as a religious war bayer said 
its sort of like finding passages in the bible that will support 
your position

david weishampel started out to do a little 
research to advise johns hopkins medical institutions on buying 
dinosaur toys and came away with some advice for the makers of 
books toys and movies consult the experts 
few dinosaurs dragged their tails and many had muscular legs with 
feet not just telephone poles with little blobs at the end 
said weishampel 36 a johns hopkins school of medicine anatomy 
professor and paleontologist 
and despite depictions of dinosaurhunting cavemen the last 
dinosaur departed the earth 65 million years ago the first 
prehistoric human existed roughly 4 million years ago no way did 
cave men or women clobber dinosaurs 
weishampels role as protector of the saurian image hasnt come 
easily after all his 3yearold daughter amy collects dinosaurs 
and 8yearold sarah enjoys last years dinosaur movie the land 
before time he doesnt want to be a spoilsport even though the 
film portrays known planteating dinosaurs as real killing 
machines that attack babies and shows them with ears 
they stuck them on to add cuteness he said baby dinosaurs 
would have been rather cute they dont need mammal heads to make 
them cute 
in the toy market weishampel said there are companies that 
put out dinosaur toys or books that try and demonstrate some 
educational value to their product that say its educational or 
museum quality that just isnt true 
tyco a moorestown njbased company that makes dino 
riders is a pretty nifty example he said they market 
mechanical dinosaurs that they claim are museumquality and are 
scientifically accurate the worst thing about them is they combine 
their products with alien life forms laserguns little saddles you 
can strap on 
the narrative is bad guys from some planet arrived on earth 
coopted dinosaurs then the good guys fought off the bad guys also 
coopt dinosaurs and therein lies the forum for kids to play with 
where does the science stop and where does the fantasy begin 
tyco senior vice president of marketing jim alley creator of 
dino riders defended the line as offering accurate models in a 
fantasy context alley isnt worried that weishampels gripes will 
hurt sales 40 million last year in the united states for the 15 
different dinosaurs or that they are misleading 
there were absolutely no cavemen alive when there were 
dinosaurs and every kid knows that alley said our purpose 
here was to make authentic dinosaurs kids could play with im 
adding the fantasy to it 
a comic book accompanying dino riders details the scenario of 
good and bad aliens passing through a spacetime portal into the 
dinosaur world and alley said he figured historical models alone 
would bore most children 
why is sticking in humans or humanoids going to enhance play 
asked weishampel he called the explanation on the package merely 
your 7cent version of articulating some science to the kids 
dinosaur popularity has been high before in the 1930s for 
example and scientists now are in the midst of a sort of 
dinosaur renaissance he said about 40 percent of all known 
dinosaurs have been discovered and named in the past two decades 
including a small planteater weishampel and a colleague discovered 
and named last summer in montana urodromeus or mountain runner 
with the field in a vigorous state he said if dinosaurs 
really excite kids and its a good way to get them educated do it 
right 
however weishampel spares some portrayals fred and wilma 
flintstone for example and their pet dinosaur dino in the 
flintstones the association of cavemen and women with dinosaurs 
certainly doesnt work in terms of what we know about in the fossil 
record 
but its not really purported to be educational

the footprints left on the moon 20 years ago 
by neil armstrong and edwin buzz aldrin should be visible for 
another halfmillion years says a chemist who studies lunar erosion 
rates 
the moon is a quiet place lacking an atmosphere and therefore 
free of wind and rain said james r arnold a cosmochemist at 
the university of california san diego 
but even without an atmosphere the moons surface is slowly 
eroded by bombardment from meteorites and cosmic rays arnold said 
they eventually will obliterate the footprints left on the lunar 
surface when apollo 11s armstrong and aldrin became the first 
humans on the moon in july 1969 
arnold and his colleagues studied moon rocks retrieved during six 
apollo missions to develop techniques to measure the rates at which 
meteorites and solar and galactic cosmic rays erode lunar rocks and 
soils 
the information bears directly on many questions about the 
evolution of our solar system including the earth he said his 
findings were presented during the recent annual meeting of the 
american association for the advancement of science

the intellectual gap between men and women 
has almost closed with females doing almost as well as males on 
tests of mathematical and spatial skills and mens verbal abilities 
nearly matching womens 
marcia linn and and janet s hyde analyzed hundreds of studies of 
sex differences and reasoning abilities conducted during the past 
two decades and concluded the differences are now so small as to 
be negligible linn said at the meeting of the american 
association for the advancement of science 
the relatively poorer performance of women compared with men on 
tests of spatial and mathematical ability has often been used to 
explain the much greater access of men to scientific fields and 
higher earning power said a statement by the university of 
california berkeley where linn is a professor of education hyde 
is a university of wisconsin psychologist 
spatial abilities involve reasoning about images such as 
locating a single figure embedded within a more complex geometric 
design 
men still outdo women in one major math test the scholastic 
aptitude test taken by high school seniors but it is being revised 
to remove any bias that may work to the disadvantage of women linn

a 375000 ultrasound microscope that 
bounces sound waves off cells or larger samples of body tissues 
should speed and improve doctors ability to diagnose cancer and 
other diseases a scientist says 
pieces of suspected tumors or other tissues removed during 
surgery or biopsy normally must be fixed or preserved and then 
stained and placed on a glass slide a timeconsuming process 
with acoustic microscopes you essentially throw the hunk of 
tissue in the microscope and look at it said dr joie jones a 
radiology professor at the university of california irvine college 
of medicine 
the microscope which operates something like a submarines 
sonar probes samples of human tissue by bombarding them with sound 
waves with frequencies 500000 times higher than sounds perceptible 
by the human ear 
the waves are changed as they pass through samples and the 
returning waves are converted into a visual picture that can be 
viewed directly photographed stored on a computer disk or strung 
together to create movies 
by determining the density and elasticity of a cells membrane 
the microscope can indicate the cells permeability or ability to 
transport chemicals in and out the permeability changes when cells 
become cancerous so the microscope can be used to diagnose and 
track cancer jones said 
such uses will lead to improved diagnoses of diseases and much 
more rapid diagnoses without the elaborate tissue preparation thats 
required today he said during a recent interview 
jones also said that because the device doesnt destroy the cells 
it examines as xrays can it will let scientists watch living 
cells in previously unknown detail and even make movies of cells 
dividing 
only two of the microscopes exist in the united states jones 
said the second is used in secret military research at sandia 
national laboratory in new mexico apparently to examine electronic 
circuits and other sensitive hardware

dr steven wexner treats patients 
with fatal diseases like cancer but his specialty is a less deadly 
malady that because of its nature is rarely discussed openly 
wexner calls it young executive tight sphincter syndrome his 
patients are usually 25 to 55 years old and professionals or 
business executives 
most people call it constipation 
it begins with a typea personality the type who eats a 
lowfiber highjunkfood diet and cant take a few minutes to relax 
on the toilet he said 
such habits lead to irregularity constipation and finally 
straining during bowel movement repeated straining against a tight 
anal sphincter causes the delicate skin to crack and bleed a 
condition called a fissure 
bowel movements become so painful that people try to avoid them 
ignore the symptoms and youll be worse off warned wexner 
whose cleveland clinic foundation lab is one of a few specializing 
in constipation and incontinence 
sufferers often wrongly assume they have hemorrhoids when they 
discover bleeding and then they buy those preparations which do 
nothing he said 
the cure for those with yetss he said is minor outpatient 
surgery a small cut is made to relax the sphincter and ease bowel 
movement most patients are able to return to work the day after 
surgery isnt always necessary if the patient seeks medical help 
at the first sign of anal bleeding and persistent constipation in 
its early stages constipation can be resolved through diet and 
relaxation 
to maintain normal bowel movements anything from three 
times a day to three times a week wexner urges a highfiber diet 
of fruits vegetables and bran along with regular exercise and 
eight to 10 glasses of nonalcoholic beverages a day and dont 
get in the habit of taking laxatives and enemas because the colon

states last year some in joint ventures with us makers up 182 
percent from the previous year nakayama noted

south korea will send purchase missions 
to the united states with shopping lists worth 4 billion to help 
ease trade frictions with its big trading partner trade and 
industry minister hahn seungsoo said monday 
the minister said he feared that the new administration of 
president bush might mount pressure on korea to further appreciate 
its won currency to correct bialteral trade imbalances favoring 
korea 
seoul prefers increases in imports to steep revaluation of the 
won because the latter approach would tend to slow down korean 
exports while stimulating imports 
the minister said korea needs to take steps to expand imports 
from the united states before may when washignton is to designate 
unfair trading countries under the tightened us trade law 
he said that an electronics import mission and a general purchase 
mission will tour the united states in march followed by a farm 
products purchase mission in april and another import mission in may 
the four missions intend to purchase 21 billion of electronics 
equipment and parts 14 billion of general machienry and parts and 
500 million of aircraft and parts he said 
korea hopes to narrow its overall trade surplus this year

texas eastern corps board of directors is urging 
stockholders not to tender their shares to coastal corp after 
rejecting as clearly inadequate coastals 26 billion cash 
offer 
in a special board of directors meeting sunday texas easterns 
board was told by financial advisers they should wait for a better 
offer 
coastal announced jan 16 it was making a cash tender offer of 
42 per share for all of texas easterns outstanding common shares 
since then texas easterns stock has soared closing friday at 48 
a share 
the tender offer is set to expire on feb 14 
dennis r hendrix texas eastens president said coastals offer 
is clearly inadequate he said the boards action are designed 
to protect shareholders from pressure tactics designed to stampede 
them into a decision before they can service a better offer 
hendrix added that the boards decision in no way prevents 
coastal from raising its bid 
if theres only one shortfused bid on the table shareholders 
dont have a choice hendrix said in a prepared statement they 
have an ultimatum it may be more than what they had but we dont 
believe it is the best they can get 
coastals president james r paul said in a statement its 
obvious that after two weeks texas eastern still does not have a 
better offer than coastals 42 a share 
he said coastal plans to respond and make further comment after 
reviewing documents that texas eastern indicated it would file 
monday with the securities and exchange commission 
in a court hearing last week in houston texas eastern officials 
said the company might use a white knight to block the coastal 
bid and had a list of more than 50 possible buyers 
coastal officials later suggested that the comment was designed 
to inflate stock prices and make their offer appear inadequate 
paul has said coastal has asked texas eastern for information 
that would justify a higher offer but said the only response has 
been rhetoric and a stonewall meeting last sunday paul met with 
texas easterns board last weekend 
analysts have said they doubt that there may be a large number of 
serious contenders to take over texas eastern a houstonbased 
natural gas company 
houstonbased enron corp which operates the nations largest 
natural gas transmission system and long had been considered a 
possible candidate for a texas eastern takeover will not say 
whether it is talking to the company 
during the court hearing before us district judge lynn n 
hughes the judge denied a texas eastern request to delay a feb 7 
hearing date in a coastal lawsuit desinged to prevent texas eastern 
from using antitakeover measures

omani oil minister saeed alshanfari said 
monday his country was ready to reduce its oil exports to help 
stabilize world oil prices following a meeting between opec and 
independent oil producers last week 
the ministers pledge was made in a statement to his countrys 
arabiclanguage daily oman and broadcast by muscat radio monitored 
in bahrain 
meanwhile syria said it plans to boost its oil exports from 
80000 barrels a day in 1988 to around 130000 to 140000 barrels a 
day this year 
omans announcement followed a meeting last week in london 
between oil experts from six opec countries and 13 nonopec 
countries 
oman is ready to reduce its exports within the framework of a 
general agreement for oil producers outside opec shanfari was 
quoted as saying he did not give any percentage 
a statement issued after last thursdays meeting called for 
nonopec oil producing nations to cooperate with the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries in stabilizing world oil prices 
the statement also urged nonopec producers to continue this 
initial effort in the second half of the year 
opec agreed last november after oil prices slumped to near 1986 
levels to cut production to 185 million barrels a day and help 
return middle east crude prices to an 18 target from below 12 the 
new quota was to take effect jan 1 
although prices have risen more than 3 a barrel since the 
agreement various reports suggest that opec production is still 
higher than the 185 million barrel mark 
opec has said it cannot stabilize prices alone and has called for 
the cooperation of nonopec producers last weeks meeting capped 
opecs latest effort to garner support from producers outside the 
cartel 
shanfari stressed that a unilateral adherence to such a request 
would be pointless as it would have no impact on the market and 
price stability all should cooperate he said 
the nonopec participants who included angola china colombia 
egypt malaysia and mexico among others said they agreed on an 
unspecified set of actions but wished to advise their own ministers 
before revealing them to opec 
at a first meeting of the two sides last april independent 
producers suggested a five percent cut 
shanfari told the newspaper that his country was playing an 
important role in such coordination 
the sultanate produces about 600000 barrels per day of which it 
exports about 550000 barrels it has in the past also restricted 
its output to help opec stabilize the market 
according to the middle east economic survey a respected 
industry publication syrias exports will be made possible by an 
increase in production from 270000 barrels a day in 1988 to 350000 
barrels a day in 1989 
the increase will come from the startup during the next few 
weeks of the omar field in northeast syria with a capacity of 
about 100000 barrels a day the newsletter reported 
the new field is operated by the alfirat petroleum co owned 50 
percent by the stateowned syrian petroleum co and by us shells 
pecten subsidiary 156 percent royal dutch shell 156 percent 
and deminex 1875 percent royal dutch shell is the operator 
the publication said exports from the new field would start in 
february or march mixed with crude oil from another producing field

polaroid corp today issued 300 million 
of stock to a private investor group and said it would buy back 11 
billion of its own stock in an apparent move to block a hostile 
takeover by shamrock holdings inc 
a spokesman for shamrock a disneyowned company that has been 
pursuing polaroid since last july would not comment immediately on 
the programs substance but said the plans objective was clear 
we have to take a look at the announcement but i think its 
absolutely obvious that its an effort to block shamrock 
spokesman john grimaldi said 
but polaroid officials denied the convertible stock issued to 
corporate partners lp a firm managed by new york investors lester 
pollack and ali wambold was a defensive move 
its designed simply to deliver a portion of the companys 
current value while enhancing the growth prospects for its values 
polaroid spokesman sam yanes said 
polaroid was at 4025 in midmorning composite new york stock 
exchange trading up 125 cents from its opening price today 
in addition to the sale of preferred stock financing for the 
repurchase program likely will be provided in part by cash on hand 
and borrowing from a syndicate of banks led by morgan guaranty trust 
company of new york and possibly other sources polaroid said in a 
statement 
companies often buy back their own stock to reduce the number of 
shares outstanding and raise the per share price such practices 
have become common among companies seeking to discourage a takeover 
yanes said the common stocks conversion price would be 50 per 
share and would have voting rights on an asconverted basis but did 
not say over what time period the stock would be purchased 
convertible preferred stock can be exchanged at a specific ratio 
by its holder at any time for shares of a corporations common stock 
eugene glazer an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in new 
york said the stock issuance would concentrate a sizeable 
percentage of the voting rights with groups friendly to polaroid 
and that will make it significantly more difficult for shamrock 
to obtain the 51 percent they would require in a proxy fight 
glazer said 
polaroid officials one week ago rejected as inadequate shamrocks 
sweetened 45 per share offer for all polaroid stock including 97 
million shares issued under polaroids controversial employee stock 
ownership plan 
shamrock officials vowed last week to proceed with plans to 
nominate a slate of candidates for election to polaroids board at 
the companys annual meeting on may 9 
if elected shamrocks candidates would be committed to selling 
the company either under shamrocks offer or to any third party that 
made a higher bid 
last july the burbank califbased company offered 40 per 
share in a friendly but unsolicited bid 
shamrock a television and radio concern wholly owned by the roy 
e disney family is scheduled march 16 to appeal in delaware 
supreme court a lower courts recent ruling upholding the employee 
stock ownership plan polaroid is incorporated in delaware 
shamrock contends the employee stock was issued to block a 
takeover it if it invalidated shamrock has promised to raise its 
offer to 336 billion or 47 per share

that the lexus name infringes on its lexis trademark for a 
computerized research service 
a threejudge panel of the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
heard arguments monday in toyotas appeal of a ruling last month by 
a federal judge who had sided with mead and issued an injunction 
that would prohibit toyota from using the name lexus or impose 
severe conditions on its use 
the appellate panel said toyota can use lexus except in national 
advertising until the court issues a decision on the merits of the 
case under an earlier stay of the injunction toyota had been 
uncertain whether it could use the lexus name in letterheads and 
when answering the phone according to its lawyer arthur gray 
mead based in dayton ohio is not claiming that anyone would 
confuse a lexus car with its lexis research service instead it is 
suing under a new york state law that protects trademarks from 
dilution toyota says lexus does not break the new york law 
the lexus line which is scheduled to go on sale in september is 
intended to be toyotas answer to honda motor cos acura and nissan 
motor cos forthcoming infiniti line of luxury cars

was mixed and corn steady at the close monday on the chicago board 
of trade 
wheat prices moved ahead at the start of the day but pulled back 
at the end of the session although contracts for delivery after may 
finished up to a nickel higher on fears of winter crop damage 
traders said 
commission house buying and prospects of colder air moving into 
the midwest send prices ahead then the old crop was struggling 
mainly because of no new export business with the soviets said 
dale gustafson a grains analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
soybean prices made gains on technical factors and a spillover in 
buying from wheat said jerry gidel analyst with gh miller 
corn was quiet gustafson said it was a follower type

mexicos business sector is beginning to join 
labor in grumbling about the governments successful 
inflationbusting program especially the programs wageprice 
freeze 
business also has been critical of new taxes imposed under a 
federal tax reform plan and increasingly is calling for reversal of 
mexicos free trade policy aimed at fighting inflation 
for more than a year the government has counted on business 
support of the economic growth and stability pact to counter labors 
anger over the wage freeze 
the program was implemented after inflation reached 1592 percent 
in 1987 and it cut inflation to 512 percent last year with 
prices growing at a much slower rate by the end of the year 
the pacts wage and price freezes come up for renewal in july 
and labor has been unhappy with what it considers pro forma minimum 
wage hikes of 3 and 8 percent since february 1988 
private sector leaders had supported the pact but complaints 
about price controls and profit squeezes surfaced last week when 
commerce secretary jaime serra puche denied the government had 
agreed to lift price controls 
there is no formal commitment of any nature in that sense 
serra puche told a news conference last week what i can assure 
you is that inside of six or seven months there simply will be a 
new agreement and we will have as the president has said a 
permanent effort to find a solution to the problems of this 
economy 
vicente bortoni director of the influential confederation of 
industrial chambers and a member of the pacts supervisory 
committee suggested business would agree to another pact extension 
only if the government begins to liberate the economy and free 
prices 
another industrialist complained that nationalized banks are 
refusing to follow the program 
ignacio munoz president of the national association of 
industrialists in transformation said last thursday that bank loans 
for new investment carry interest rates of about 80 percent while 
the banks own borrowing costs run around 49 percent 
high interest rates discourage new private investment munoz 
said while businesses have been forced to absorb a 40 percent 
increase in electricity rates januarys 8 percent wage increase and 
a 35 percent jump in social security contributions 
the business confederation of the mexican republic and the 
coordinating council of industrial associations joined the chorus to 
protest a new 2 percent tax on fixed assets 
the 2 percent tax part of a tax reform promised by president 
carlos salinas de gortari seeks to reduce the governments fiscal 
deficit but the confederation and council contended that the tax 
only worsens the private sectors ability to make new investments 
further more industrialists are citing a liquidity squeeze in 
urging the government to impose restrictions on imports a move that 
would reverse a 2yearold trade liberalization policy 
former president miguel de la madrid employed free trade as a key 
antiinflation tool through august consumer goods imports surged 
by 133 percent and capital goods imports by 57 percent helping to 
suppress prices but wiping out mexicos trade surplus 
official data have yet to be published for september when most 
economists believe mexico began running a trade deficit 
if this problem persists and gets worse the capital goods 
industry in mexico which has already been hurt is going to see the 
crisis deepen elias meckler president of the coordinating 
council told local reporters last week 
but serra puche ruled out trade barriers free trade has been one 
of salinas key weapons in trying to make mexicos manufacturers 
more efficient and success in that goal would reduce prices in 
mexico and increase exports 
serra puche declined to say what changes may be in store for the 
pact but said the agreement is fundamental its been very useful 
for the mexican economy and it will continue being the standard of 
the commerce department

usx corp said monday that charles a corry a 
tax lawyer and corporate planner who once aspired to little more 
than middle management has been elected to succeed david m 
roderick as chairman and chief executive of the oil and steel giant 
the move has been expected since last february when corry as 
president of the corporate remnants in the usx diversified group 
was given the title of president of the entire company and assistant 
to roderick 
corry 56 will take the top job june 1 the day after roderick 
65 retires as mandated under company policy 
chuck corry has worked closely with me on the restructuring of 
the corporation during the 1980s this experience makes him uniquely 
qualified to lead usx into the decade of the 90s roderick said 
i am pleased that the board chose him and he has my strong 
support 
on the new york stock exchange usx rose 37 cents a share to 
3250 
roderick led the transition from us steel corp which was 
largely dependent on steelmaking to usx which derives twothirds 
of its 15 billion in annual sales from oil and gas yet remains the 
nations largest steel producer 
corry has described himself as an unemotional person and not one 
to willingly sacrifice his personal life for his career 
i work more than i would prefer he said in march 1988 of a 
routine that kept him in the office from 710 am to 545 pm 
in that interview with the pittsburgh press corry said he places 
personal values ahead of material success 
i feel sorry for people who no matter how successful are 
not happy he said i have been a happy person all my life i am 
content with myself and i always have been ive made peace with 
myself a long time ago and we all have to find that peace so that 
when we lay our head down on the pillow at night we sleep soundly 
and we are content with ourselves 
corry said he once tried to plot his career 
i figured out that if everybody retires when they should and if 
i move up as i should i was going to be tax manager at about 46 
years old and i would have thought that was a pretty successful 
career he said 
the board did not make a new selection for the office of 
president a post corry will vacate june 1 when he becomes chairman 
and chief executive the position was empty from the retirement of 
william roesch in november 1983 until corrys appointment last year 
a cincinnati native corry began his usx career in the tax 
department of the former american steel and wire division in 
cleveland in 1959 a series of tax and finance assignments in 
pittsburgh and new york led to his promotion to tax department 
general manager in 1975 and assistant comptroller in 1978 
he became vice president of strategic planning in 1979 and 
senior vice president and comptroller in 1982 the year us steel 
acquired marathon oil co 
while still responsible for corporate planning corry oversaw 
much of the asset sales from the nonoil and nonsteel businesses 
assembled in the diversified group

calls to a commodities industry complaint hotline 
have jumped by about 27 percent from a year ago since the public 
disclosure of a federal fraud investigation centering on the 
nations biggest futures exchanges hotline officials said monday 
the calls to the national futures association hotline which are 
up to about 630 a day reflect how investors who feel they may have 
been cheated by commodities traders are anxiously watching the 
federal investigation 
its been very busy around here i can say that said tony 
rose the director of the hotline 
the twoyear investigation at the chicago mercantile exchange and 
chicago board of trade involves allegations that as many as 100 
brokers and traders systematically cheated customers out of millions 
of dollars 
some market watchers say investor reaction to the burgeoning 
scandal could vary partly because there is no real indication who 
may have been cheated or for how much 
the action on the floors of the merc and board of trade is a 
rapid chaotic process involving traders and brokers who represent 
individual investors pool investors banks investment firms 
multinational corporations farmers and argicultural merchants 
to the extent that there are victims they would be the public 
customers a doctor a lawyer an indian chief john q public 
saidstephen selig a commodities law professor at new york 
university and former chairman of the new york bar associations 
committee on futures regulation they either paid more than they 
should have when they bought or got a lower price than they should 
have when they sold 
for example suppose an investor puts in an order to buy soybeans 
at the market price at the time the trader receives the order the 
price of soybeans is 7 a bushel and moving higher 
the trader is bound by law to execute the customers order before 
trading for his own account but an unscrupulous trader could buy 
for his own account at 7 a bushel and sell the soybeans to fill the 
customers order at 701 a bushel moments later 
although traders are suspected of raising the price only by a 
quartercent or halfcent when skimming illegal profits investors 
say the difference adds up 
when i was a buyer i felt the fill or an order they gave me 
was a cent above the market said jim lovdahl president of 
monmouth grain and dryer co in western illinois but his losses 
totaled more than one cent 
for example on 100000 bushels that would be 1000 
lovdahl said 
gary martin president of the peoriabased ostrum martin inc 
grain elevator company said its like ive got a guy shoveling a 
barrel of corn and what does it hurt if he takes a handful out of 
each shovelful well it does hurt 
archerdanielsmidland co the large decaturbased agricultural 
concern whose complaints reportedly led to the federal 
investigation repeatedly has refused to talk about its role 
other large interests such as the investment firm dean witter 
reynolds inc are concerned about possible losses but are waiting 
for more information before pointing fingers said dean witter 
spokesman jim flynn 
at the commodity futures trading commission the federal agency 
that regulates the futures markets officials said it was too early 
to pinpoint who may have been burned by futures traders 
hypothetically it could come off the back of the little old 
lady in tennis shoes who lives in des moines but its hard to 
say a farmer or a little old lady or a dentist in peoria or adm 
itself got hurt said cftc spokesman david gary

one or two institutions have been quite happy to sell some 
stock to take profits after the markets 139percent rise since 
the new year the dealer said

down from their best levels

federal communications commission chairman 
dennis r patrick acknowledging concerns on capitol hill about a 
proposal to revamp the way atampt sets its prices for interstate 
services on monday postponed a decision on the plan until march 
a decision by the fcc on a socalled rate cap method of pricing 
for american telephone amp telegraph cos longdistance services had 
been scheduled for monday but after members of congress said the 
fcc may not have legal authority to make such a change patrick 
issued a statment prior to the meeting saying he would defer a vote 
until march to give lawmakers more time to study the plan 
given the importance of this docket the complexity of the 
docket and in order to accommodate the interest in some additional 
briefings and the provision of some additional briefing information 
i have agreed to reschedule this item for the meeting on march 16 
patrick said at mondays hearing 
i believe it is very important for the commission to craft 
regulations which will improve the incentives that are facing 
dominant carriers patrick said on the other hand the congress 
is intensely interested in this docket i would hope that in the 
spirit of the new administration that we can use this as a 
foundation to establish a more constructive dialogue with members on 
both sides of the aisle with respect to this matter and other 
matters that are pending before the commission 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce committee which oversees telecommunications matters 
welcomed patricks decision to delay 
i think the commission acted wisely dingell who had 
criticized the fcc proposal said in a statement the congress had 
a number of concerns about the impact of the price caps proposal and 
the fcc appears to be addressing them as the details of the plan 
receive public scrutiny and go through the congressional hearing 
process i hope the spirit of cooperation with congress will 
continue 
since the early 1960s the government has allowed atampt a certain 
profit beyond its costs but the fcc proposed replacing this 
socalled rateofreturn regulation for dominant carriers such 
as atampt with ceilings on prices that would include the seven 
regional bell companies that atampt spun off in 1984 
the commission said its proposal would encourage greater 
efficiency and innovation and save customers 16 billion over four 
years if all the dominant companies participated the fcc last may 
proposed that atampt be allowed to raise rates 3 percent less than 
annual inflation 
atampt said in a statement it was disappointed and frustrated 
by patricks deferral and that every day a decision was delayed 
the public loses 
bellsouth one of the seven regional phone companies that would 
be affected by the new pricing scheme said the commission appears 
to have stepped away from an opportunity to save telephone users 
billions of dollars 
another regional company bell atlantic said we are sorely 
disappointed that the fcc and congress have been unable to resolve 
their differences over how to best implement a price cap plan that 
will benefit consumers the telecommunications industry and the 
nation 
lawmakers had been skeptical of the new plan 
as currently structured the price cap scheme will permit 
carriers to set prices that may deviate significantly from costs 
said a report last november from the democratic staff of the house 
energy and commerce telecommunications subcommittee 
there is no assurance that rates would remain even with a 
zone of reasonableness 
on jan 19 in an attempt to allay lawmakers concerns patrick 
sent a letter and supporting documents to the chairman of the 
telecommunications panel rep edward j markey dmass and to 
dingell 
he assured markey and dingell that the price cap proposal had not 
been rushed through by his staff and that he had recommended a 
number of changes in the plan including a delay in implementing the 
proposal for the regional bell companies and other local exchange 
carriers 
he said he also would recommend establishing separate price cap 
baskets for atampts business and residential customers to prevent 
the company from raising residential prices to finance rate 
reductions for businesses 
he also proposed an automatic stabilizer which he said would 
operate to ensure that local carriers earnings remain within the 
zone of reasonableness and that consumers share in the efficiency 
gains price cap regulation is designed to generate

lambert inc

early buying in wheat said jerry gidel another chicago analyst 
with gh miller

back 66 positions in its domestic fixedincome division because of a 
slowdown in bond trading and sales 
the investment firm said the cuts involve less than 1 percent of

the outgoing president of an import car 
dealers organization on monday criticized chrysler corp chairman 
lee iacocca for backing a move to stick a 25 percent tariff on 
imported vans and sport utility vehicles 
the treasury department in washington is considering a plan that 
would reclassify the hotselling vehicles as trucks instead of 
cars that would raise the import tariff from 25 percent to 25 
percent of the vehicles value and add an estimated 2000 to 
3000 to price tags 
iacocca general motors corp chairman roger smith and ford motor 
co chairman donald petersen signed a joint letter to treasury 
secretary nicholas brady on jan 16 saying that without the change 
the domestic industry would be hurt and the treasury would lose 
millions of dollars in potential revenue 
robert mcelwaine who has been president of the american 
international automobile dealers association for 19 years accused 
iacocca of backing the move only to benefit chrysler 
boosting tariffs on the foreign vehicles could prompt customers 
to buy domesticallyproduced alternatives 
lee iacocca thinks americans should feel ashamed and humiliated 
because the treasury department didnt cave into his little scheme 
that would cost consumers more than a billion dollars a year and 
not incidentially add a halfbillion to chrysler corps already 
swollen profits mcelwaine said during a speech 
mcelwaine and others in new orleans for the national automobile 
dealers association convention said changing the tariff would be 
disasterous for some importers and import dealers 
one such company is range rover of north america inc whose 
luxury sportutility vehicle made in england is the only vehicle the 
company sells in the united states president charles hughes said 
the customs service classified the vehicle as a car in 1984 when it 
first was introduced in the united states 
the price of a range rover if the 25 percent fee is imposed 
would climb past 40000 
i dont think anybody can look us in the face and say a 40000 
vehicle is designed to haul goods hughes said 
the ruling also could affect dealers such as herb overstreet who 
sells nissans in lakeland fla nissan now imports its pathfinder 
from japan 
it the pathfinder is a small percentage of my business 
overstreet said we just have not had the availability he also 
said he now sells all the pathfinders he can get and would like to 
have more 
it the new tariff would just kill sales he said we have 
our fingers crossed 
nissans tom mignanelli executive vice president for operations 
said one of the companys options is to move production of the 
pathfinder to its plant in smyrna tenn that move would take about 
a year but would enable nissan to avoid the increased tariff on the 
vehicle he said 
one way or another we will not give up an inch in 
pathfinders he said 
but the future for nissans axxess minivan to be introduced in 
march as a 1990 model isnt as guaranteed mignanelli said 
there is the possibility that if the tax stays on axxess is in 
jeopardy he said

americans aftertax incomes shot up 38 
percent last year with some of the extra money going to raise the 
nations personal savings rate from the 40year low it had hit just 
a year before the government said monday 
the commerce department said the gain in income adjusted for 
inflation was the best since a 39 percent gain in 1986 and more 
than double 1987s 17 percent 
in other economic news the stock market continued its march past 
precrash levels monday while a new survey showed the cost of 
employersponsored healthcare plans increased dramatically last 
year 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials edged up 125 points to 
232411 its highest close since the market crash in october 1987 
the healthcare survey by a foster higgins amp co in new york 
found that healthcare costs rose 186 percent per worker last year 
after increases of 77 percent in 1986 and 79 percent in 1987 
in december personal income totaled 42 trillion with much of 
the 371 billion jump from november resulting from farm subsidy 
payments without those outlays the government said decembers 
total income would have been up 08 percent 
last years income gains spurred both spending and saving 
consumer spending rose 28 percent after adjusting for 
inflation following increases of 27 percent in 1987 and 43 
percent in 1986 
in december alone spending rose 09 percent with the biggest 
increase 41 percent posted for durable goods big ticket 
items expected to last three or more years 
the average personal savings rate rose a full percentage point 
from 32 percent to 42 percent the highest since the 44 percent 
set in 1985 
the 1987 rate was the smallest since a 31 percent rate in 1947 
in all economists said the figures were a good sign for 
continued economic strength in the coming year 
theres a balanced picture for consumers with a strong 
increase in income a solid increase in spending and some increase 
in savings said allen sinai chief economist for the boston co 
all three of those are quite desirable if the expansion is 
going to keep on rolling along 
added robert g dederick an economist with northern trust co in 
chicago 
people continue to fill their wallets and then they continue to 
empty them and this clearly should provide the impetus for a further 
push in growth in the first half of 1989 
however lawrence chimerine head of the wefa group an economic 
consulting firm in bala cynwyd pa cautioned that much of the 
years income growth came from increases in employment and could not 
be expected to continue unabated joblessness was at a 14year low 
in 1988 
once we run out of people to put into the labor force well 
see much smaller growth in income chimerine said 
both dederick and chimerine said the savings rate still was too 
low and that while the spending and income picture for 1988 was 
generally good high levels of spending have made it more difficult 
to narrow the nations trade deficit as consumers fail to curb their 
appetite for foreign goods 
the year ended on a strong note as personal income in december 
before adjusting for inflation rose 09 percent 
wages and salaries a key component of income were up 06 
percent to 253 trillion in december following a revised 03 
percent gain a month earlier the volatile category of farm income 
soared 732 percent to 239 billion after plunging 668 percent in 
november 
sinai said the yearend strength was impressive and suggests 
that consumers will have the wherewithall to keep spending for a 
number of months 
there are no impediments in sight to continued good growth in 
income and consumption he said the consumer is supportive of 
our expansion at this point neither spending in a boomlike way nor 
showing any signs of a fade in spending

a pair of denverbased cable companies united 
cable television corp and united artists communications inc said 
monday they cannot meet the feb 28 deadline for their 
previouslyannounced merger but that are continuing their talks on a 
business combination 
analysts said they expect the deal to proceed but possibly at a 
slightly higher price than the 16 billion value they had placed on 
the original deal 
the proposed merger which involves a complicated cashandstock 
swap would create the nations thirdlargest cable concern 
the companies who cancelled an allstock merger plan after the 
october 1987 stock market crash announced last march they had 
agreed to a cashandstock merger 
but on monday the companies said in a joint statement that 
because of delys resulting from regulatory requirements the 
deal could be terminated by either party because the closing cannot 
occur by the feb 28 deadline specified in the agreement 
the companies also said they were discussing on what terms any 
business combination between united cable and united artists could 
go forward 
a spokesman for united artists communications said he could not 
elaborate on the statement a call was placed to united cable but it 
was not returned 
one official familiar with the discussions but speaking on 
condition that he not be identified said the delays involved 
securing securities and exchange commission approval for a proxy 
statement outlining the terms of the deal 
its a process that seems to have taken longer than 
anticipated he said he said the feb 28 deadline could not be 
met because the companies must allow 20 business days after mailing 
proxy statements before a shareholder vote can be taken on the deal 
the proposal would allow united cables shareholders to convert 
their shares into either 35 in cash or stock in the new company 
with a separable right to sell a share of the new companys stock at 
special terms the cash portion of the deal was available on up to 
49 percent of united cables 464 million fully diluted shares 
united artists shareholders would have the right to convert their

the brewing industry is getting ready for a major 
shakeup of the 239yearold tied house system under which most 
of britains 80000 pubs are owned by brewers and generally only 
sell beer made by the owner 
the monopolies and mergers commission is expected to decide 
friday that the system should be relaxed so that pub operators also 
can sell beers made by the owners competitors 
such a decision also could invite further competition from 
foreign brewers such as us giant anheuserbusch inc 
there also is speculation the commission might go as far as 
recommending that brewers be limited to ownership of 500 pubs each 
the commission which will submit the findings of its more than 
twoyear study to trade secretary lord young is unlikely to 
recommend blocking brewers from owning pubs altogether the way us 
liquor companies are prohibited from owning bars 
the idea is that there would be greater choice and cheaper beer 
for consumers said a spokesman for the national licensed 
victuallers association which has 18000 tenants as members 
virginia graham a spokeswoman for the consumers association 
said its unrealistic to think that the monopolies and mergers 
commission is going to end the whole system but i think it may make 
some far reaching changes to it 
she added we have always felt that the existence of tied pubs 
does limit consumer choice 
ahead of the monopolies commissions anticipated decision 
brewers already are reaching agreements to sell each others more 
successful brands as socalled guest beers through their own 
pubs 
small brewers only have a few brands so they are eager to be able 
to offer big sellers such as bass plcs carling black label 
fosters which is owned by australias elders ixl and also brewed by 
grand metropolitan plc and harp owned by guinness plc 
britains two other big six brewers are alliedlyons plc and 
whitbread plc 
beers share of britains alcohol market has declined to 56 
percent in 1987 from 71 percent 10 years earlier 
britain consumed 38 million barrels of beer in 1987 538 percent 
of it ale and stout and 462 percent of it lager which americans 
know as beer 
concurrently competition has heated up in the brewing industry 
the monopolies commission now is reviewing a 3 billion hostile bid 
by elders for scottish and newcastle breweries plc 
the tied house system dates to 1750 but really expanded in the 
late 19th century when brewers sought reliable outlets for their 
beers and licensing authorities tried to limit the number of pubs 
the brewers society said 
at the same time pubs turned to brewers for loans to upgrade 
their premises and meet new regulatory standards requiring for 
example bathrooms 
about 40 percent of britains pubs now are tied houses owned by 
brewers and managed by tenants according to the society some 20 
percent are managed houses owned by breweries and run by their 
employees 
the remaining 40 percent are socalled free houses which can buy 
and sell any beer they like but many of the free houses are enticed 
with financial lures such as favorable loans to do business with 
only one supplier 
predictably the brewers society which represents most of the 
nations brewers argues for the tied system saying it ensures that 
small brewers remain competitive with bigger rivals it also says 
the system means a tenants investment and rent are much lower than 
if he were in business by himself 
the tenant and consumer associations said they would like to see 
pubs allowed to serve more kinds of beer but they also want the 
tied system somehow maintained to protect small brewers 
independence

texaco inc has removed the icahn millstone from 
around its corporate neck but questions remained monday about 
whether the new texaco created in the process will be the 
improved company promised by management 
a number of analysts believe that after two years of bankruptcy 
reorganization a massive restructuring and a new weekend trce with 
carl c icahn its largest shareholder texaco has emerged a leaner 
more efficient company 
but there are questions about where the nations third largest 
oil concern will go from here and the extent of the benefit to 
shareholders from the latest move 
pressure from icahn to boost shareholder value or face a takeover 
had helped inflate the companys stock price over the last year from 
about 36 on speculation that he would mount a buyout attempt 
after a series of secret meetings with management icahn agreed 
this weekend not to boost his 166 percent stake in texaco for seven 
years or to make another takeover move texaco in turn agreed to pay 
24 billion in special dividends to shareholders and to buy back 
some of its stock 
icahn stands to gain some 300 million if the plan is approved by 
shareholders 
on monday texaco fell 425 a share to 5025 in new york stock 
exchange composite trading as speculators sold off their stock 
analysts said 
the agreement restricts how icahn can dispose of his holdings 
said dennis odea attorney for texacos shareholder committee who 
believes the agreement was a good compromise in response to 
different shareholder groups 
while all shareholders would receive the dividend sarah teslik 
executive director of the washington dcbased council of 
institutional investors said she sees the agreement as a type of 
greenmail because icahn forced texaco into a payout it 
otherwise would not have made 
greenmail is an antitakeover maneuver in which the target company 
buys back a raiders stock at a price higher than that paid to other 
stockholders 
if it was done for shareholders i dont know what the 
shareholder reasons are other than to get him icahn off their 
backs said teslik whose trade association represents 65 large 
pension funds with 300 billion in assets 
its not clear that its in the shareholders interests to take 
money now or whether it can better be used in the longterm interest 
of the company said teslik 
michael young an analyst with the investment firm smith barney 
harris upham amp co said the plan which must receive shareholder 
approval was not the preferred route of texaco management and that 
the prospect of a special dividend was orchestrated by demands from 
icahn 
smith barney on monday lowered its rating of texaco from a buy 
stock to neutral young said 
were hardpressed to see how the company benefits in the 
longer term young said 
nevertheless many analysts and investors believe texaco has 
learned from its mistakes and that with icahn off its back 
management can focus more on the oil business 
in the early 1980s a struggling texaco unable to find oil to 
replace its dwindling reserves purchased the reserverich getty oil 
co pennzoil co sued claiming texacos acquisition interfered with 
its prior contract to buy getty 
a houston jurys 103 billion judgment against texaco forced the 
company into bankruptcy to avoid posting a potentially ruinous 
multibillion dollar security bond to continue its appeals of the 
award shareholders helped force a reluctant management to settle 
with pennzoil for 3 billion a key element in the companys 
bankruptcy reorganization 
almost immediately a legion of disgruntled shareholders led by 
icahn moved to wrest control of the company claiming management was 
not doing enough to increase the value of the stock 
that pressure spearheaded by icahn led to the current 
restructuring 
last week texaco completed one of the final steps in its 
restructuring with the sale of its 78 percent stake in profitable 
texaco canada inc for nearly 4 billion including special 
dividends with the sale of its deutsche texaco ag for 12 
billion and 50 percent of its refining and marketing assets to saudi 
arabia as well as smaller properties texaco will collect more than 
7 billion in proceeds 
i think its going to become an operating company now said 
earl gould portfolio manager and energy analyst with atlantic 
richfield co in los angeles which owns 100000 shares of texaco 
stock 
but while the restructuring leaves texaco on sounder footing it 
remains to be seen whether it will be a competitor in the oil 
business in the 1990s 
the real dilemma for thisas to find oil that 
will determine its future value young said

polaroid corp said monday it planned a 
11 billion stock buyback and would issue 300 million in new 
preferred stock to a private investor group in what analysts 
labeled defensive moves to help thwart a hostile takeover by 
shamrock holdings inc 
polaroid also indicated it had invited two members of the 
investor group corporate partners lp to join its board of 
directors 
the instant photography pioneer since july has been fighting a 
hostile buyout offer from shamrock which now is offering 45 a 
share in a tender offer that values the company at about 32 
billion 
shamrock also has indicated it will wage a proxy fight for 
control of polaroids board at the companys annual meeting in may 
and if successful would force the sale of polaroid either under its 
offer or any higher thirdparty bid 
shamrock president and chief executive officer stanley gold 
called polaroids actions irresponsible and a sign of management 
entrenchment 
the placement of preferred stock together with the proposed 
stock buyback program is clearly a defensive action designed to 
park even more polaroid shares in friendly hands at the expense of 
polaroids public shareholders gold said in a prepared statement 
polaroid closed monday at 4062 up 62 cents in composite new 
york stock exchange trading 
polaroid spokesman sam yanes denied the stock issuance was a 
defensive move designed to discourage the burbank califbased 
companys advances 
its designed simply to deliver a portion of the companys 
current value while enhancing the growth prospects for its values 
yanes said 
companies frequently buy their own stock to reduce the number of 
shares outstanding and raise the share price such practices have 
become common among companies seeking to discourage a takeover 
some analysts said polaroids stock buyback was unlikely to 
attract shareholders unless the market price of polaroid stock tops 
the 45 a share offer already made by shamrock 
theres no incentive for people to sell the polaroid stock 
said alex henderson an analyst with prudential bache inc in new 
york 
henderson said stockholders would do better to tender their stock 
to shamrock and wait for the market price to rise if the stock 
appreciates he said stockholders could withdraw the tendered 
shares and sell them on the open market 
the catalyst to all this restructuring is shamrock whether 
polaroid officials admit it or not he said 
peter enderlin an analyst with new yorks smith barney harris 
upham amp co predicted polaroids stock price would rise due to the 
repurchase plan and that the company was prepared to pay more than 
the 45 offered by shamrock 
unless shamrock comes back with another increase i think 
definitely the pendulum has swung to polaroid protecting their own 
company said charles k ryan an analyst with merrill lynch 
capital markets 
the preferred stock to be issued to corporate partners a firm 
managed by new york investors lester pollack and ali wambold is 
convertible to common stock at a price of 50 a share 
the group also received warrants to purchase 635000 shares of 
polaroid common stock at 50 a share 
polaroid has 716 million common shares outstanding 
polaroids board of directors last week rejected as inadequate 
shamrocks sweetened 45 offer which includes 97 million shares 
issued under polaroids employee stock ownership plan 
shamrock a television and radio concern owned by the roy e 
disney family is appealing a delaware court ruling that upheld the 
polaroid employee stock ownership plan polaroid is incorporated in 
delaware 
shamrock contends the employee stock was issued specifically to 
block a takeover if the plan is invalidated shamrock says it will 
raise its offer to 336 billion or 47 per share

a federal judge issued a restraining order 
against tyson foods inc on monday saying the company may have 
violated federal securities law to gain an undue advantage over 
conagra inc in their billiondollar fight to acquire rival poultry 
processor holly farms corp 
tyson which has offered to buy holly farms for 115 billion 
was ordered to refrain from making false misleading inaccurate or 
incomplete statements involving holly farms 
senior judge richard robinson issued the order in us district 
court here at the request of omahabased conagra holly farms has 
agreed to be acquired by conagra in a 1 billion stock swap but 
invited both of its suitors to submit further bids 
kirk blecha a tyson attorney said the decision was being 
reviewed by company lawyers 
there does appear that there was a serious breach in tysons 
obligation under federal securities law which resulted in tyson 
attaining an unfair advantage in its efforts to acquire holly 
farms robinson said 
he said his temporary restraining order would extend until feb 
9 the date for a hearing on whether to make it permanent 
conagra alleged that tyson officials issued false statements in 
interviews and press releases jan 19 and 20 
the statements indicated holly farms board had recommended 
accepting tysons offer of 6350 per share conagra officials said 
at the time conagra said the only tender offer before 
shareholders was 60 per share 
conagra said the information caused heavy trading in holly farms 
stock and that holly shareholders were induced to sell their stock 
prematurely the number of shares of holly stock tendered to tyson 
increased from nearly 13 million to 5 million 
conagra said holly shareholders were mistakenly tendering their 
shares at 60 a share thinking tysons tender offer was 6350 per 
share 
the statements were aimed at preventing conagras merger with 
memphis tennbased holly farms conagra charged 
tyson based in springdale ark said information in press 
releases it issued was correct at the time it was issued and that 
at one point in its negotiations with holly farms the holly farms 
board had accepted its 6350pershare offer 
the holly farms board later issued a statement that it would not 
accept tysons offer of 6350 per share 
tyson said conagra was trying to prevent tyson from disclosing 
any information about its offer to holly 
robinson said his order requires only that tyson exercise 
circumspection in making statements to inform shareholders and 
investors 
tyson is the nations largest poultry processor while conagra 
ranks second and holly farms is third
