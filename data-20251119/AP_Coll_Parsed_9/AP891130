a man who spoke russian entered a 
store in the bazaar opened a black briefcase and produced an 
automatic weapon 
after several minutes of negotiation the shopkeeper paid him 
200000 afghanis or 500 for the gun when a reporter approached 
him in the street seconds later and addressed him in english the 
man got into a green jeep without license plates and drove away 
who was this man 
merchants said he and dozens like him identify themselves as 
soviet soldiers since the soviet withdrawal was completed feb 15 
they say those soldiers have sold them at least 20 automatic 
weapons 
where the men are stationed or what they are doing here the 
shopkeepers can only guess 
diplomats from countries with close ties to the soviet union say 
the only red army soldier in afghanistan is the embassy military 
attache they say all the others left in february 
the afghan governments position on the issue has not been 
clear on oct 14 the official news agency bakhtar reported the 
presence of soviet military advisers in kabul 
it added that they only handle deliveries of arms and provide 
information on the specifications of arms and ammunition to the 
afghan side and do not take part in military operations at all 
a day later government spokesman mohammed nabi amani said the 
bakhtar report was an error that there were no soviet soldiers 
in afghanistan 
another government official quoted an afghan military officer as 
saying soviet soldiers operated a missile base on the outskirts of 
kabul he said the soviets were unwilling to train afghan soldiers 
to use the scud rockets they provide which require advanced 
tracking methods and use of computers 
more than 1000 scuds have been fired and the government has 
credited them with important victories over moslem guerrillas 
according to diplomats in kabul and neighboring pakistan 
a us intelligence report has alleged that soviets in afghan 
uniforms operate the scud base 
many diplomats discount the report and say soviet soldiers no 
longer are engaged in combat in afghanistan some add however 
that soviet officers direct the civil war and the operations of 
khad the afghan intelligence and secret police agency at the 
defense and interior ministries 
a communist bloc journalist who visited the defense ministry 
frequently said he discovered soviet advisers in several 
departments 
any country that is supplying billions of dollars a year to 
another country is not going to sit by and let that country direct 
its war effort one diplomat said 
such influence by the soviets over afghanistans security 
politics and economy has created problems between the two 
governments 
afghan officials say privately that soviet officials tend to 
treat them like colonial subjects and a recent incident 
illustrates the point 
journalists were taken to a battlefield to see captured weapons 
a soviet bodyguard armed with grenades an assault rifle and seven 
clips of ammunition accompanied a soviet television crew 
during the helicopter flight to lalandar 12 miles south of 
kabul the bodyguard dressed in blue jeans and a combat jacket 
ordered an afghan officer to give up his seat and barked commands 
to the pilot 
when a swiss journalist snapped his photograph the guard 
grabbed the camera and exposed the film 
the journalist appealed to officials from the foreign ministry 
who said they could do nothing the ministry later protested to the 
soviet embassy 
and the question still remains who was the man in the bazaar

the operator of a crane that collapsed and 
killed five people said he was considering entering an alcohol 
treatment program to dry out after his work on the highrise 
was over his brother said thursday 
the crane operator lonnie boggess was among those killed in 
tuesdays accident he had twice tried to commit suicide during the 
last nine months and had been hospitalized for psychiatric 
observation twice since march according to court documents 
obtained by mcclatchy newspapers 
boggess 45 died with three other construction workers and a 
school bus driver when the 240ton crane he was operating plunged 
16 floors in the bustling financial district 
boggess brother john said the machine operator had a drinking 
problem and suffered from stress related to his highrisk job 
he told me he was considering admitting himself to an alcohol 
program to dry out after this job was over said john boggess 
the san francisco coroners office said thursday that an autopsy 
would attempt to determine boggess bloodalcohol level at the time 
of death it will be made public in two to three weeks the 
coroners office said 
family members were also concerned about perhaps a heart 
problem or stroke john boggess said from his home in exeter a 
small city in the san joaquin valley but he conceded he had no 
specific information that his sibling a heavy smoker had a heart 
condition 
we mostly were concerned about high cholesterol said 
boggess a sales executive he attributed his brothers problems to 
a bitter divorce and the stress of a highrisk job 
authorities were checking into reports that boggess was seen 
slumped over the controls as the crane began its plunge 
were waiting for the coroners report to find out whether 
there may have been a heart attack or something like that because 
we have heard they are unconfirmed reports that someone saw him 
slumped over said district attorney arlo smith 
were trying to find that individual if there is somebody 
who reported seeing that 
boggess sister 34yearold genoa hefke said she spoke 
wednesday afternoon with a worker who was on the ground and in 
radio contact with boggess before the accident 
she said the worker told her that the radio suddenly went silent 
and that boggess may have had a heart attack 
all of a sudden he stopped answering and then it started 
rocking back and forth she said 
the state occupational safety and health administration 
meanwhile said it is investigating reports of illegal drug use 
among workers at the construction job site the new york times 
reported in its friday editions 
hamilton h fairburn the agencys deputy director said osha 
would conduct toxicological tests on the bodies of boggess and 
three other workers who died the times reported 
boggess was in the cranes cab 200 feet above the ground when 
the accident occurred the crane was being raised from the 16th 
floor to the 20th floor of a highrise under construction for the 
federal home loan bank 
the reports of boggess alcoholism and suicide attempts appeared 
in thursdays editions of the sacramento bee and the morning news 
tribune of tacoma wash where boggess lived 
boggess employer the erection co of kirkland wash refused 
to comment 
officials at swinerton amp walberg co the general contractor for 
the highrise project had no knowledge of his personal life 
said company spokesman larry duggan 
the contractor said the accident apparently was triggered when 
the head of the crane accidentally rotated 180 degrees while the 
cranes height was being increased an operation that requires the 
machine to be perfectly balanced however it said in a statement 
that the rotation occurred for unknown reasons 
state officials say they are focusing on mechanical or human 
error giving low priority to such factors as wind or structural 
failure said hamilton fairburn deputy chief of the state 
occupational safety and health administration

hungry for foreign currency and western consumer 
technology the soviet union is seeking to sell its mig29 
warplanes in the west a respected journal of military affairs 
reports 
janes defense weekly says in its issue published wednesday that 
western companies are negotiating to buy mig29 fulcrum 
fighters first operational in 1985 for research and experimental 
purposes 
the soviet aviation ministry recently hosted a joint venture 
group of six american british west german and danish businessmen 
who could act as a sales outlet for up to 150 mig29s at 20 
million apiece janes said 
quoting an unnamed businessman who participated janes said a 
soviet aviation ministry agency told the visitors that the whole 
range of migs was available to western customers as well as the 
sukhoi su25 frogfoot 
the mig is named after the initials of its original designers 
artem mikoyan and mikhail gurevich fulcrum and frogfoot 
are nato codenames 
migs have long been a symbol of superpower rivalry they 
featured in the korean and vietnam wars in the sovietsupplied air 
forces of arab countries against the ussupplied israelis and 
now in the ethiopian civil war 
starting with the mig15 and leading up to todays mig31 each 
new generation and its western rivals symbolized a fresh escalation 
of the eastwest arms race 
janes said the us defense department declined to comment the 
british defense ministry said it knew nothing of the reported 
proposals 
janes said the businessmens visit was prompted by the apparent 
grounding of mig23 flogger aircraft said to be used by the 
us air force in aggressor training roles at nellis air force base 
in nevada 
it said the usoperated migs were reportedly obtained from 
egypt in an arms deal involving usmade f16s and were grounded 
because of their poor condition 
janes quoted one of the businessmen as saying the joint venture 
group has already mediated to provide these mig23s with spare 
engines 
a businessman was quoted as saying the soviets were keen to sell 
modern warplanes to the west because they are almost desperate to 
bring in foreign currency and modern consumer technology such as 
telefax machines microwave cookers desktop and handheld 
computers 
they used to request very large deposits but now theyre 
acting like normal businessmen

tupolev154 and three yak42 planes would be sold to local airlines 
in jiangsu fujian and sichuan provinces 
the report said there was real potential for such deals since 
both countries are short of hard currency china would be able to

the head of the peoples front of the soviet 
republic of lithuania says he expects president bush to ask mikhail 
gorbachev in malta for guarantees not to use force against peaceful 
independence movements in the baltic republic 
we have the right to be an independent state vytautas 
landsbergis chairman of the peoples front or sajudis told the 
associated press on wednesday 
he said he asked us policymakers to seek a commitment that the 
soviet army or kgb security police will not crack down on 
secessionist movements in lithuania or the neighboring republics of 
latvia or estonia 
my information is that they will seek such a commitment 
said landsbergis who met wednesday with raymond seitz assistant 
secretary of state for european affairs 
landsbergis in an interview with ap editors and reporters 
declined to disclose details of his discussions with seitz us 
officials have not specified what bush will tell gorbachev when he 
meets with him in this weekends shipboard summit off the coast of 
malta 
landsbergis a 57yearold musicologist praised the united 
states for refusing to recognize the soviet unions forced 
annexation of lithuania latvia and estonia at the end of world war 
ii 
the soviet parliament this week passed legislation to give the 
baltic republics a large degree of economic autonomy from moscow a 
significant step toward independence 
the recent legislation should mean we will be able to be less 
attached to the colonial centrally planned soviet system and 
should have more room to maneuver he said 
last march in the most democratic elections in soviet history 
sajudis candidates won 36 of 42 seats allocated to lithuania in the 
national congress of peoples deputies 
landsbergis predicted that sajudis would win a majority in 
elections scheduled for february for the lithuanian parliament 
which he said would then negotiate for independence from the soviet 
union 
but moscow might not hear our declaration he said 
therefore landsbergis said he asked us officials to seek 
guarantees of nonintervention and to raise the issue at the united 
nations or another international forum 
we have received support from the united states for decades in 
that it has refused to recognize the legality of soviet annexation 
and that has had great importance to us he said now that the 
baltic issue has become a matter of international importance we 
would like us policy to become even more active 
we would like the baltic occupation to be raised at the malta 
summit as an international issue that has not been resolved he 
said soviet efforts to portray the baltic issue as an internal 
affair have failed 
sajudis immediate goals he said are to have a pluralistic 
multiparty system and in conjunction with that to eliminate the 
monopoly by the communist party and the privileges that go with 
it 
the object is to reestablish sovereignty not only as an 
expression of our own legitimate right but because we feel that it 
is useful for eastern europe in general and also very useful for 
the soviet union he said 
we already have that which we would call spiritual 
independence our people have lost their fear and openly speak 
their minds landsbergis said 
asked whether a sovereign lithuania would join the kremlinled 
warsaw pact military alliance landsbergis said it is possible 
that it will be a condition for gaining our independence 
soviet and lithuanian negotiators will sit down at a bargaining 
table in the foreseeable future to hammer out details of lithuanian 
independence he predicted and it may well be that moscow will 
make entry into the warsaw pact one of the conditions

the pentagon as president bush departs for 
the malta summit with mikhail gorbachev says it will move ahead 
with plans making the giant mx nuclear missile a railmounted 
weapon 
the 50 intercontinental ballistic missiles which are to be 
stored at military sites scattered around the country and moved on 
trains during times of crisis are designed to launch a 
devastating retaliation in the face of any soviet attack 
the air force announced wednesday that the 50 missiles in 
underground silos in wyoming will be moved to garrisons or 
shelters at military installations in wyoming louisiana texas 
washington north dakota arkansas and michigan 
the dispersal will allow the weapons to survive a surprise 
strike the air force argued as well as provide the potential 
for prompt retaliation vital to the successful deterrence of war 
the new system is expected to be completed by 1994 the air 
force said 
the soviets have two landbased mobile icbms the ss25 and 
ss24 
the 50 mx missiles dubbed the peacekeeper by former 
president reagan will be placed on 25 trains each with two mx 
missiles aboard the trains will be kept on seven air force bases 
and moved onto civilian railroad tracks in time of crisis 
the announcement came wednesday as bush prepared to depart for 
his malta meeting with gorbachev secretary of state james a baker 
iii said the meeting will permit the leaders to be in much better 
shape and much better prepared to reach an agreement on slashing 
such longrange weaponry at their second summit set for next year 
us and soviet leaders have expressed hopes of signing an 
agreement at that later meeting to cut strategic weapons by as much 
as 50 percent 
but wednesdays announcement also represents the bush 
administrations commitment to push ahead with plans to modernize 
the nations strategic nuclear missile force even amid projections 
of pentagon belttightening heightened prospects for armscontrol 
agreements and sweeping changes in the soviet union and its warsaw 
pact allies 
the new basing system is the latest step in the controversial 
missiles 18year history 
the mx which stands for missile experimental was first 
proposed in 1971 in its early development it was seen as a mobile 
missile designed to prevent the soviets from knowing where to aim 
to destroy it 
subsequently the air force studied more than 30 basing 
modes including trucking it around the country submerging it in 
lakes or keeping it airborne on special planes 
in 1979 president carter proposed shuttling the weapon on 
racetracks in southern utah and eastern nevada but reagan 
rejected that plan in 1981 
congress in a fouryear battle with the administration slashed 
reagans request for 100 of the missiles to 50 and they were 
placed in hardened underground silos in 1986 reagan proposed 
shifting to the railbased system advocated by the air force 
earlier this year bush opted to move forward with two mobile 
intercontinental ballistic missile systems by putting the 
10warhead mx on trains while also building the smaller 
truckbased midgetman 
bushs decision has run into considerable opposition in congress 
both among those who contend the twoprong program is too 
expensive and among those who favor one weapon or the other 
bush signed a military spending bill last week that establishes 
a 11 billion fund for both the mx and the midgetman with the 
exact spending split left to defense secretary dick cheney 
the cost of taking the nations 50 mx missiles out of their 
underground silos at warren air force base in wyoming and building 
the new garrisons or shelters is expected to be at least 56 
billion said a pentagon source who requested anonymity 
hopefully it will be completed by 1994 but that clearly 
depends on the budget the source said 
the pentagon said the missile trains will be housed at warren 
and these other air force bases barksdale in louisiana dyess in 
texas fairchild in washington grand forks in north dakota little 
rock in arkansas and wurtsmith in michigan 
warren afb will be the center of the mx operation and the 
training site for the garrison crews

one of the biggest agricultural problems of 
the next decade will be a shortage of railroad cars for 
transporting grain a railroad spokesman says 
jim howarth csx assistant vice president said wednesday that 
his company has about 13000 covered hopper cars but that 
nationwide the fleet is shrinking 
csx one of the nations largest freight railway companies 
operates between the east coast and chicago and as far south as new 
orleans 
howarth said railroad companies dont get enough profit from 
hauling grain and that big freight companies will abandon more and 
more lines for lack of business in many rural areas 
you cant get away from the fact that the railroad system was 
overbuilt for todays transportation howarth said adding that 
his company supports the growth of shortline rail companies to 
carry products short distances or to larger freight train systems 
wallace burnett of the transportation department said some 
business might return to railroads as the cost and congestion of 
trucking increases 
howarth and burnett spoke at outlook 90 a threeday conference 
sponsored by the agriculture department to examine farm policies 
and factors that affect them 
howarth said that when csx decides to discontinue a line it 
looks for a shortline operator to take over 
we want to see as many lines as possible continue operating 
he said shortline owners are sometimes public entities but 90 
percent tend to be private owners who feel they can make a go of a 
piece of railroad that a big company cant 
csx howarth said recommends that grain companies buy their own 
railroad cars to ensure transportation is available 
during another segment of the conference wednesday a housing 
consultant described the plight of elderly farm workers who often 
find themselves with no money and no home when they retire 
joseph belden deputy executive director of the housing 
assistance council said a study he conducted showed no federal 
housing projects exist specifically for farm workers 
although they often qualify for subsidized housing under other 
programs the biggest problem is that farm workers tend to stop 
working about age 45 rather than 62 as required to qualify for 
retirement housing under many federal programs 
because of the working conditions this group is going to be 
older at a younger age belden said describing the backbreaking 
toil and harsh lifestyle of migrant farmworkers 
he said there was anecdotal evidence to show that many farm 
workers dont get social security benefits either because their 
employers never withheld payments from their wages or because they 
were stolen by dishonest employers 
another problem facing rural planners is poverty among children 
carolyn rogers a usda demographer said studies show that since 
the late 1970s there has been an increase in poverty among both 
urban and rural occupants 
rogers said that in 1987 about 24 percent of the children in 
rural areas were below the poverty line another 9 percent were 
considered near poor which means they are either right at the 
poverty line or in families that make just 149 percent of the 
poverty threshold 
the poverty threshold of a threeperson family with one child 
under 18 was 9142 in 1987 and for a fourperson family with two 
children under 18 it was 11519 
rogers said much attention had been paid to the breakdown of 
families in central cities but statistics show that the number of 
rural children living with just one parent also has increased 
from 14 percent in 1960 to 25 percent in 1988 about 29 percent of 
urban children live with one parent 
rural development policies need to include education and 
employment that lead to greater earnings for parents and improved 
financial conditions for their children rogers said 
the type of childhood experienced in the rural community will 
undoubtedly affect the decisions of the next generation about 
remaining in the community she said

providing security for the superpower 
summit is a huge task for this tiny country which will dedicate 
its entire military and most of its police to protecting the 
american and soviet presidents 
the shipboard location of this weekends summit between 
president bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev in marsaxlokk 
harbor has added to security problems and stretched maltese 
resources one official said 
but prime minister edward fenech adami and others say no special 
security problems are posed by libya which is about 220 miles 
north of marsaxlokk harbor or by the ability of libyans to travel 
freely here 
maltese officials say they are confident their 1200member 
armed forces and 1800member police force can protect the leaders 
during their threeday stay 
i think our police forces and armed forces are equipped enough 
and trained enough to provide the necessary security fenech 
adami said in an interview wednesday 
being a small country does not mean that security problems are 
larger he said in fact on the contrary being a small 
country both as to the size of the country itself and the size of 
the population can render security less of a problem 
fenech adami who met with libyan col moammar gadhafi on sunday 
in tripoli said gadhafi is in favor of the summit and objects only 
to it being held on warships in the mediterranean 
i see no special security threat said armed forces 
commander brig john spiteri weve always had good relations 
with the libyans they have never given us any trouble and 
there is no reason to suppose they will this time 
we havent identified a serious threat from anybody said 
spiteri who commands the security operation but of course 
that can make security concerns more difficult 
spiteri said that if there were a specific threat against either 
bush or gorbachev during the summit meetings saturday and sunday 
authorities could look for it and plan accordingly 
one senior government official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said holding the summit aboard the guided missile 
cruiser uss belknap and the soviet missile cruiser slava had added 
to security concerns 
if the summit was only on land you have just one restricted 
area to close off the official said but since the leaders 
will be moving on the island and staying on the ships we will have 
to close off areas both on the land and the water 
he said the government will close the port to commercial traffic 
other than small fishing vessels for the three days the leaders 
are in malta and close the air space above the harbor to private 
aircraft for security reasons the government has stopped work on 
a construction project inside the harbor that employed 800 workers 
who still will be paid 
spiteri said one maltese boat will patrol outside the entrance 
to the harbor and another around the two warships anchored in the 
center keeping all pleasure craft and fishing boats at least 200 
or 300 meters away from the cruisers 
soldiers will patrol the shoreline and seal off an area near the 
st luciano tower a 16th century watch tower built by the knights 
of malta on a jagged cliff that juts out into the harbor at the 
point closest to the warships 
police plan to set up roadblocks and checkpoints near the harbor 
and close off some roads to the public 
the security force will include maltas entire military force 
and most of its police including an antiterrorist squad of about 
100 members 
a source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the threeday 
security operation is expected to cost the government the 
equivalent of 150000 in overtime costs plus at least 400000 
from the closing of the harbor and malta freeport and from stopping 
construction on the terminal 
we assume the soviet and us governments obviously will cover 
the commercial costs and expenses said the source we do not 
expect that the two superpowers will expect a small country like 
malta to bear the costs of a superpower summit

the agriculture departments watchdog agency 
says some large farming operations are successfully using highly 
complex methods to get around federal limits on crop subsidies 
despite recent reforms ordered by congress these farming 
operations have been able to dodge a 50000 limit on federal crop 
subsidies and probably will continue collecting the fat subsidies 
again this year 
the departments office of inspector general said 1987 
legislation failed to effectively limit the use of multiple legal 
entities to avoid the payment curbs other loopholes were also 
cited 
a new audit report released to the associated press on wednesday 
included an example of how the curbs are circumvented 
one operation reviewed by auditors in tunica miss created 51 
irrevocable trusts in 1989 so as not to have payments reduced by 
further restrictions taking effect this year 
the remodeled operation involved three joint ventures controlled 
by two intermingled families which had included 43 persons in 
1988 
auditors said the 43 persons consisted of six individuals 
and 37 corporations owners of the 37 corporations consisted of 11 
individuals and one corporation 
seven of the individual owners were the immediate members of 
the two families a father and two daughters and a father two 
sons and a daughter that controlled the operation the report 
said 
if the complex arrangement had remained as it was in 1988 it 
would have collected no more than 700000 in payments in 1989 but 
with reorganization the operation is expected to collect as much 
as 1431576 in subsidies this year 
one of the family members of this organization told us that 
the main purpose of the reorganization was to maintain the maximum 
program benefits the report said he said it became a 
challenge to see if he could get a trust established for all of the 
operations fulltime employees he called it a profitsharing 
plan 
although the reorganization was allowed by current regulations 
auditors said the trusts are believed to be flowthrough 
entities to avoid new regulations last year limiting a persons 
membership in more than three entities 
we conclude this because about 13 billion per year will be 
routed back to the seven immediate family members through 
management fees equipment and land leases and loans the report 
said 
the heart of the crop subsidies are federal deficiency 
payments used to make up part of the difference between a higher 
target level and a lower market price are supposed to be limited to 
50000 per person as an example last months average corn price 
at the farm was 220 per bushel the target price for 1989 corn is 
284 
however our review determined that producers have found new 
innovative ways to reorganize farming operations so that 1989 
payments will not be limited significantly by the legislative 
changes the report said 
the audit report followed one sent to congress describing the 
usda inspector generals activities for the sixmonth period that 
ended sept 30 
in that review the excessive crop subsidies were noted among a 
number of abuses checked by usda investigators and auditors the 
audit report released wednesday dealt specifically with operations 
of crop programs handled by the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service 
the auditors checked five state offices of the agency and 14 
county offices in the counties 822 of 7424 farm operating plans 
were selected for preliminary review finally 52 farms were chosen 
for indepth analysis no individual names were released 
states and counties selected for indepth review included 
arkansas jefferson crittenden and phillips counties 
california butte and kern louisiana morehouse natchitoches and 
tensas mississippi de soto noxubee and tunica and texas 
jackson jefferson and lubbock 
the review of 52 farming operations identified 12 that 
reorganized so that all entities which can be individuals 
corporation association trust or other legal entities could 
continue receiving payments as persons under the program

the chicago lawyer who investigated the ethics 
case of former house speaker jim wright is rejecting a report that 
he unfairly lobbied ethics committee members by taking them to 
expensive washington restaurants 
a new book on wrights tenure as speaker the ambition and the 
power contends that richard j phelan routinely took committee 
members out to dinner at some of the most expensive restaurants in 
washington as part of a calculated campaign to win his case 
the book by washington freelance writer john barry published 
this month by viking contends phelan ran up a 150000 expense 
account while seeking to curry favor with what amounted to wrights 
jury 
that is absolutely nonsense said phelan who is running for 
president of the cook county board the top elective post in the 
county that includes chicago 
he said he did take several committee members out to lunch and 
dinner but when he did it was cheapsville the house dining 
room or a lowpriced chinese restaurant 
the 150000 figure represented food lodging and other expenses 
for a staff of 10 people over a sevenmonth period he said 
the idea that some lawyer from chicago could come out and 
schmooze 12 hardnosed congressmen into bulldozing the speaker of 
the house defies any kind of logic at all phelan said 
barry during the two years he spent working on the book was 
granted unusually broad access to otherwise private meetings of the 
house leadership and meetings with staff and other lawmakers he 
also obtained access to some transcripts from closeddoor meetings 
of the ethics panel 
in june wright became the first speaker in history to resign 
under fire in midterm after the ethics panel formally charged him 
with 69 violations of house rules 
how much phelans lobbying of the ethics committee affected the 
outcome of the case will remain in dispute detailed expense 
records for phelans investigation are not available to the public 
the records are kept by a house administration subcommittee chaired 
by rep joseph gaydos dpa who also is a member of the ethics 
committee 
despite its sympathy with wrights plight before the ethics 
committee the book concludes that the former speakers downfall 
was largely the result of his own arrogance 
house republicans had long complained about his heavyhanded way 
of running the chamber and they believed he overreached to take 
control of central america policy from president reagan by the 
time his ethics problems cropped up wright had become a lonely 
figure estranged even from his own power base among democrats 
the book contrasts what it calls phelans conscious strategy of 
playing to the political side of the committee with what it 
portrays as a weak and inept defense of wright by his lawyer 
william c oldaker oldaker appeared not to recognize that 
committee members were worried about justifying their decision on 
wright to the public and the news media barry writes 
oldaker once angrily quoted phelan as having told him this 
case will be decided by the editorial pages of the nations 
newspapers according to the book 
wright while contending that he never broke house rules also 
seemed to believe that the rules shouldnt apply to him barry 
concludes 
a former close aide craig raupe once said i dont 
understand how jim wright can be so politically in tune and then be 
almost totally blind to appearances barry writes 
the book also contains glimpses inside the sometimes profane and 
rough world of leadership meetings at one members were discussing 
whether to assign a member who is jewish to the foreign affairs 
committee 
ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill 
objected 
you cant put him there there are already four kikes on that 
committee he is quoted as saying a rostenkowski spokesman 
denied the statement was ever made but barry said he was certain 
of the remark

in the battle for public opinion on abortion 
a daunting challenge confronts those who say young girls should be 
able to obtain abortions without first telling their parents 
the problem for abortion rights advocates is that most americans 
view the issue now under supreme court study primarily as one 
of parental rights 
many who support the supreme courts 1973 decision that women 
have a constitutional right to abortion also favor parental 
involvement when minors seek abortions public opinion polls 
indicate 
the supreme court after hearing arguments wednesday in cases 
from minnesota and ohio must decide whether states may outlaw 
abortions for most unmarried girls under 18 unless their parents 
are notified or a judges approval is given 
about half the states have such laws although most of them have 
been blocked by court challenges 
those who oppose notification laws may be in danger of being 
perceived as enemies of parents and families 
that perception has not escaped antiabortion forces stung by 
the momentum their movement lost after julys supreme court 
decision giving states more power to regulate abortions 
it defies common sense to suggest that children should be 
allowed to undergo surgery without the foreknowledge of their 
parents annlouise lohr an attorney with americans united for 
life said after wednesdays high court session 
the commonsense solution is that parents be informed of 
their minor daughters medical situation she said 
cleveland lawyer linda sogg however earlier told the justices 
that not all young girls have loving and supportive parents some 
young girls must be protected from abusive mothers and fathers she 
said 
of the approximately 180000 girls under 18 who obtain abortions 
each year about half are accompanied by one or both parents when 
they go for the operation 
ms sogg argued that state parental notification laws likely do 
not affect such girls but others who may be better off not telling 
their parents need to be protected from intrusive state regulation 
whatever the court says about parental notification laws in 
decisions expected by july will not necessarily endanger the 1973 
roe vs wade decision that legalized abortion 
the consensus among lawyers on both sides of the abortion issue 
is that the justices will not use the minnesota and ohio cases as 
vehicles to reassess the 1973 ruling 
but james bopp general counsel of the national right to life 
committee disagrees roe vs wade is on the table he said 
the court has to decide whether there is a right to abortion 
before saying whether a particular parental notification law 
violates any right 
if the parental notification cases are to carry any impact for 
adult women the words of justice sandra day oconnor will be 
decisive 
oconnor who as the courts sole woman never has said 
explicitly whether she believes an abortion right exists 
controlled the outcome of last julys ruling 
she has never voted to invalidate a state regulation on 
abortion but seemed greatly troubled by minnesotas requirement 
that both biological parents be notified 
the question is whether oconnor could vote to strike down the 
minnesota law without stating or at least implying that it 
violates some constitutional right enjoyed by young girls 
four justices support the 1973 conclusion that abortion is 
constitutionally protected four justices appear ready to abandon 
that decision 
if oconnor a critic of the rationale used in roe vs wade 
decides to articulate some alternative approach she will have 
charted a new course for the future of abortion law

members of a house committee say the 
government needs more disciplinary muscle against doctors and 
hospitals that provide substandard care for medicare patients 
the recommendation was in a report wednesday by the house 
government operations committee that also criticized the department 
of health and human services for a fouryear delay in writing 
regulations to implement a law that gives the agency more power to 
punish healthcare providers 
the law enacted in 1985 allows hhs to deny payment to 
hospitals and physicians in cases where substandard care is 
provided 
the department is working on the regulations said dennis 
siebert a spokesman for the health care financing administration 
that agency handles medicare the government health care program 
for 33 million elderly blind and disabled americans 
theyre fairly controversial and complex regulations he 
said weve spent a lot of time consulting with medical care 
industry 
physicians may be terminated from participating in medicare or 
fined up to the amount of the care provided but only in cases 
where there has been a clear pattern of incompetence by physicians 
who were unwilling or unable to improve their treatment 
the report said the standard that must be met is too stringent 
because it allows physicians to escape punishment by agreeing to 
take an educational course to indicate their willingness to 
improve it also said the monetary penalty is too low 
hhs inspector general richard kusserow has recommended that 
congress strengthen the standard and raise the fine to 10000 per 
case 
the report based on a threeyear investigation by the panels 
human resources and intergovernmental relations subcommittee 
estimated that more than 800000 errors are made each year by 
doctors and hospitals caring for medicare patients 
the most common error was not having adequate discharge plans 
for posthospital care the report said that was the case for 
about 3 percent of the medicare admissions selected randomly and 
reviewed by peer review organizations in 1989 the report said 
extrapolating that to the 11 million annual medicare admissions 
amounts to 330000 failures 
the large number of beneficiaries who may be at risk of 
inadequate hospitaldischarge planning is of special concern to the 
committee due to fears that the pps system medicares system for 
paying hospitals is resulting in patients being discharged 
faster and less stable the report said 
eight republicans on the 39member committee cautioned in an 
accompanying document that the error estimate was derived by 
extrapolating from reviews called generic screens that are 
designed to detect potential problems 
an error can result from merely failing to sign a form in the 
proper place they said 
if an exhaustive look were taken at all generic screen 
failures we are convinced the number of quality problems would be 
far below the committee reports projections they said 
under the pps system or prospective payment system created in 
1983 as a medicare costsaving measure hospitals are paid a flat 
fee for each treatment they provide the fee assumes a certain 
length of hospital stay and medical services

the pentagon estimates it will be forced to 
slash about 17 billion from its planned 1990 spending because of 
the effect of the grammrudman budget reduction law 
pentagon spokesman jim turner said wednesday it wasnt 
immediately clear what the exact impact of the cuts would be or 
how they would affect manpower decisions 
turner called the figure a preliminary estimate pending 
formal notification from the office of management and budget 
were still trying to figure out how its all going to fall 
turner said 
had the terms of the grammrudman deficit reduction law been 
fully enforced over a year defense programs would have been pared 
by 8 billion or half the 16 billion spending reductions the law 
would have automatically imposed on most federal programs 
president bush said repeatedly in recent weeks that he preferred 
retaining the acrosstheboard cuts for a full year to accepting 
congressional efforts to reduce the deficit which he said 
contained phony savings 
pentagon officials had warned of severe cutbacks in military 
personnel and weapons acquisition if the grammrudman cuts had been 
left in place the entire year 
the development comes as bush signed with reservations a bill 
authorizing 305 billion for defense programs for the current 
fiscal year including a cut in his request for the strategic 
defense initiative 
the measure cuts 11 billion from bushs 49 billion request 
for spending on the sdi program or star wars in the fiscal year 
that began oct 1 
bush said in a statement that the measure would provide 
sufficient funds to provide a national defense sufficient to meet 
foreseeable threats to the national security in the coming year 
the legislation represents the first cut in the sdi program in 
six years 
the bill also trimmed his request for other major strategic 
programs such as the mx and midgetman nuclear missiles and the b2 
stealth bomber 
the legislation reduces the ceiling on the number of us troops 
overseas by about 15000 those troops were associated with 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons banned by a ussoviet treaty 
signed in december 1988

hud secretary jack kemp is moving aggressively 
to clean up scandalplagued programs but its too soon to say 
whether his efforts will be successful the agencys chief watchdog 
says in a report to congress 
despite kemps efforts staffing problems caused by budget 
constraints threaten to undermine even the best attempts to rid the 
department of housing and urban development of mismanagement and 
political influence inspector general paul a adams said in the 
report issued wednesday 
the department and oig office of the inspector general face 
critical staffing shortages resulting from acrosstheboard 
budget cuts made under the grammrudman deficitreduction law 
adams said in his semiannual report to congress 
adequate staffing continuity of leadership and management 
accountability are essential if the reform measures are to work 
he said 
adams said that while it was premature to grade the substance of 
kemps efforts the secretary has already taken aggressive 
corrective actions and proposed widespread reform measures 
including the elimination of programs not benefiting the needy 
adams said the media and congressional attention hud has 
received since april when his report on a rehabilitation program 
riddled with wasteful spending and political favoritism was issued 
have complemented kemps reform efforts 
the positive aspect of the current situation is that it 
creates an environment in which needed reform can take place 
adams said while it is too soon to predict the reform actions 
success i will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of those 
measures 
kemp in a separate report to congress said his management team 
had resolved 97 percent of the nearly 1700 internal audit 
recommendations awaiting management action when he took over hud 
early this year 
huds management team is aggressively cleaning up problems 
which over many years and during several administrations have 
made wellintentioned programs susceptible to fraud political 
influence and the waste of taxpayers hardearned dollars kemp 
said 
adams report recounted the problems found in virtually all of 
huds major housing and loan programs fraud waste and 
mismanagement with a pricetag estimated at more than 6 billion 
the government adams said could save millions if congress 
would amend federal housing laws to allow refinancing of hudbacked 
mortgages at todays more favorable interest rates he renewed his 
call for congress to grant inspectors general subpoena powers to 
force witnesses to cooperate with investigations 
he warned that huds government national mortgage association 
often referred to as ginnie mae saw its default portfolio 
grow from 31 billion to 125 billion last year in large part 
because of bad real estate markets in oil patch states 
adams said the agency needs to increase its reserves to offset 
losses and take steps to reduce future defaults 
kemp acknowledged in his report that no steps had been taken to 
improve gnma management but said an analysis was underway 
since april adams said hud has recovered more than 25 million 
owed the government implemented reforms that saved 21 million and 
committed itself to recovering another 50 million

sen donald riegle voicing frustration with 
the controversy over the nations biggest savings and loan failure 
says news reports downplay evidence that he and four other senators 
did nothing improper 
very sensationalized stories have run putting such a sinister 
colorization on this thing riegle dmich said wednesday i 
resent it i think its unfair 
he said little attention was given to sworn testimony by federal 
regulators that the senators did not influence the regulators 
actions toward lincoln savings amp loan association such testimony 
basically blows away the story he said 
riegle chairman of the senate banking committee has said 
little publicly about his role in the battle between federal 
regulators and lincoln which the government seized in april 
regulators estimate the thrifts failure will cost the taxpayers 2 
billion making it the costliest sampl collapse in the nations 
history 
the senate ethics committee has hired an independent counsel to 
examine allegations that five senators improperly intervened with 
regulators on lincolns behalf the senators are riegle alan 
cranston dcalif john mccain rariz john glenn dohio and 
dennis deconcini dariz 
all the senators except riegle attended an april 2 1987 
meeting with edwin j gray then chairman of the federal home loan 
bank board gray says the senators improperly pressured him to drop 
a regulation that would have curtailed risky savings and loan 
investments 
riegle joined the other senators at an april 9 1987 meeting 
with california regulators who were investigating lincoln 
all five received large campaign donations from former lincoln 
owner charles h keating jr riegle returned the 78250 he 
received from keating and associates 
in an interview riegle voiced frustration over allegations that 
keating bought the senators influence he said gray and other 
regulators who testified before the house banking committee 
repeatedly said the senators did not influence them 
they were absolutely clearcut on that issue and they said it 
over and over again he said 
some of the senators have described their involvement as a 
normal constituent service riegle however said he did not 
consider his attendance at the april 9 meeting a constituent 
service even though he had visited keating properties in arizona 
the previous year and keating had purchased and renovated the 
pontchartrain hotel in detroit 
i went as a member of the banking committee he said the 
responsibility for handling their situation was in the hands of 
others who had them as a direct constituent 
he said he was confident the ethics committee would find that 
all my actions were entirely proper and that case would do him 
no longterm political damage

investor carl c icahn is making another play 
for usx corp the giant oil gas and steel concern 
icahn who announced plans to acquire sizable stakes in 
pittsburghbased usx twice before disclosed wednesday that he is 
requesting federal approval to acquire at least 25 percent of the 
corporation 
icahn known for his past corporate takeover attempts owns 
trans world airlines inc 
usx finished down 12 cents at 3362 in new york stock 
exchange trading wednesday icahns disclosure came after the 
markets closed 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission icahn 
revealed that he was seeking permission from the federal trade 
commission to increase his stake in usx ftc antitrust clearance 
for such an acquisition is required under the hartscottrodino 
antitrust improvements act 
usx spokesman william kessler said the company was aware of 
icahns filing but had no comment icahn kessler said made 
similar requests in late 1987 and late 1988 but never boosted his 
stake to the amount requested with the allotted year 
this is the third time hes filed kessler said this is a 
renewable thing 
according to the sec filing made public just after 5 pm 
wednesday icahn owned nearly 34 million or 1326 percent of 
usxs outstanding shares of common stock 
the sec document noted that in november 1988 icahn made a 
hartscottrodino filing indicating his intention to acquire more 
than 15 percent of usxs voting securities and depending upon 
market conditions more than 25 percent of its voting securities 
but because his group did not acquire in excess of 15 percent 
within a year a new filing is required to permit acquisition above 
15 percent said the filing 
in the latest sec filing icahn said he was doing so under 
hartscottrodino indicating that the registrants have a good 
faith intention to acquire more than 15 percent and up to 25 
percent of usxs voting securities 
the filing said the acquisition was dependent on market 
conditions and redemption or invalidation of a poison pill 
shareholder rights plan adopted by usx on oct 10 in an attempt to 
ward off a hostile takeover 
the usx plan would take effect once a person or group acquired 
at least 15 percent of the companys common stock 
under the plan shareholders would be issued one stock right for 
each common share they already hold the usx board could give 
shareholders the option of exchanging the rights for common stock 
at the ratio of one share of common stock for each right thus 
increasing the number of shares a raider would have to acquire 
usx has said the plan was designed to prevent someone from 
gaining control of the company without offering a fair price to all 
stockholders 
in october icahn said his group was considering making 
proposals for business combinations with usx

canadian prime minister brian mulroney fresh 
from moscow says soviet president mikhail s gorbachev isnt 
looking for miracles from malta but deserves help from the west 
such as observer status at world trade talks 
president bush and mulroney had a private dinner at the white 
house wednesday night in the last of bushs presummit 
consultations with leaders of the western alliance before he leaves 
today for malta and this weekends shipboard talks with gorbachev 
mulroney who returned sunday from his own talks with gorbachev 
spent nearly three hours at the white house before flying back to 
ottawa bush thanked him profusely for coming 
i cant tell you how much i appreciate your advice and your 
observations bush said 
then in what the president acknowledged was a little 
unorthodox fashion bush left his guest on the driveway to hold 
forth for canadian and american reporters 
mulroney defended bush against charges that he has been too 
timid in responding to the fastmoving tide of democratic and 
economic changes sweeping the east bloc nations 
the administration has a responsibility to act with 
prudence he said president bush is president of the united 
states and leader of the western alliance and it is important that 
he act not in haste but that he act effectively 
i believe that his intensive preparations and his very 
constructive attitude i believe that this is going to bring about 
good results 
mulroney said he recommended that the soviet union be granted 
observer status at the general agreement on tariffs and trade talks 
the discussions where the worlds major industrialized nations 
lay the ground rules for international trade and that gorbachev 
get a personal briefing after each economic summit of the seven 
major nations of the west 
that briefing he said should be conducted by the chairman and 
host of the g7 summit which happens to be bush for the 1990 
meeting to be held next spring or summer in texas 
what did president bush think of it i think he kind of liked 
it said mulroney 
my belief is that president gorbachev looks upon the malta 
summit not with a view to any achieving any miracles but with a 
view to building a sustained and solid relationship with president 
bush that will give rise to major accomplishments down the road 
mulroney said 
gorbachev mulroney said is in for the long haul himself i 
think hes got an ambitious progressive agenda for the future 
some of his suggestions are worthy of thoughtful and generous 
response and on the basis of that there are some gestures that 
can be taken he said 
there also might be a series of steps to bring the soviets 
more closely into the inf and world bank ambit the canadian 
leader suggested 
the meeting was the fourth oneonone session this year between 
the two north american leaders 
also attending the private dinner were secretary of state james 
a baker iii white house chief of staff john h sununu brent 
scowcroft the national security adviser robert m gates deputy 
national security adviser and edward n ney the us ambassador 
to canada 
mulroney was accompanied by canadian secretary of state for 
external affairs joseph clark stanley h hartt the prime 
ministers chief of staff and derek burney the canadian 
ambassador to washington 
bush conferred with british prime minister margaret thatcher at 
camp david md last friday and has spoken with other nato and 
western alliance leaders by telephone in advance of the 
mediterranean summit he has promised not to spring any surprises 
on the allies 
asked if bush had assured him of no surprises such as former 
president reagans discussing abandoning nuclear arms with 
gorbachev at reykavik iceland in 1987 mulroney said oh you 
can be certain of that

attorney general dick thornburgh ordered 
federal prison officials to withdraw a dayold plan to restrict 
press interviews of inmates just hours after reporters sharply 
questioned him about it 
the attorney general faced angry questions wednesday about his 
plans for new justice department guidelines being drafted to stem 
the flow of unauthorized information 
during the tense session thornburgh defended the bureau of 
prisons proposal to limit each inmate to one press interview a 
month as part of what is necessary to properly manage prison 
facilities 
but late in the day thornburgh abruptly and unexpectedly issued 
a brief statement saying he had ordered the bureau of prisons to 
withdraw the proposed regulations which had been put out for 
public comment 
the plan would have limited the number of press interviews at 
each prison facility to one a day 
thornburgh had also faced hostile questioning about a provision 
of the plan that would have empowered wardens to bar future 
interviews by reporters who failed to seek comment from officials 
about allegations made by inmates of mistreatment or other 
conditions 
ed koren an attorney for the american civil liberties union 
prison project called the provision a form of censorship designed 
to cut off any kind of criticism and to protect the bureau of 
prisons from any embarrassments 
thornburgh told reporters the regulations were designed to 
ensure an accurate flow of information 
i think there is a problem that they are trying to address of 
reconciling their management responsibility with the flow of 
information in and out of prisons 
but the attorney general said he had not personally reviewed the 
proposed regulations before they were published in tuesdays 
federal register 
in his statement released late in the day thornburgh said 
this proposal was submitted prematurely and without my personal 
review it will be subject to further review before resubmission 
justice department spokesman david runkel said thornburgh was 
told of the proposed regulations tuesday night he decided 
wednesday afternoon to order them rescinded he met wednesday 
morning with reporters 
james jones chief spokesman for the bureau of prisons said 
there were only a few changes from current policy in the proposed 
regulations he said the bureau has long required reporters to seek 
its response to allegations about prison conditions made by inmates 
thornburgh said leaks of information about criminal 
investigations prompted him to order a full review this fall of 
press guidelines in the department and all its component agencies 
i expect it to result in two things one that we will have 
some success in reducing the number of leaks of pending criminal 
investigations and secondly that we speak with one voice on 
policy matters 
it was lets leak like a sieve when i got here thornburgh 
said 
the attorney general repeated his warning that he would 
prosecute department officials who leak details of an ongoing 
criminal investigation 
those persons are criminals themselves because they violate 
the privacy statutes and the theft of government property statutes 
that the congress has enacted 
thornburgh has ordered investigations of numerous leaks 
including a probe to identify the source who disclosed an 
investigation of alleged financial irregularities in the office of 
rep william gray iii dpa 
the leak unleashed a storm of accusations from house democrats 
that the disclosure was politically orchestrated by thornburghs 
aides while gray was seeking election as house majority whip 
the department eventually issued a statement saying gray was 
cooperating with the investigation and wasnt a target 
asked wednesday if he were satisfied the gray leak had not come 
from his staff thornburgh said i havent had an opportunity to 
review the results of the investigation 
the review of department press guidelines that thornburgh said 
he ordered earlier this fall has already resulted in new press 
guidelines at the immigration and naturalization service 
gene mcnary the new ins commissioner ordered all field offices 
to get clearance from washington before responding to a wide 
variety of press questions 
in september runkel had rebuked drug enforcement agency 
officials for confirming reports that dea agents had arranged the 
sale of crack in a park near the white house at the request of 
president bushs speechwriters 
the president displaying a plastic envelope containing the 
crack told of the undercover sale in his televised speech to 
unveil his antidrug strategy

machinist union leaders are vowing to continue 
their strike against eastern airlines 
machinists president george kourpias said wednesday that the 
union would try to pressure texas air corp easterns parent 
company and the bankruptcy court overseeing the cashstrapped 
carrier into a settlement 
the union also plans to push eastern to make overdue payments to 
its pension plan which is owed as much as 1 billion and take 
legal action against eastern and texas air if the payments are not 
made 
eastern is strapped for cash and court actions involving the 
underfunded pension plan could affect easterns attempt to emerge 
soon from bankruptcy 
kourpias said the union would lobby congress to win enough 
support to override president bushs veto of legislation creating a 
congressional panel to recommend a solution 
eastern pilots and flight attendants cited the veto last week in 
deciding to end sympathy strikes in support of the machinists who 
walked off the job march 4 after refusing to grant more than 150 
million in workrule and other concessions 
the union represents more than 3000 eastern employees who 
worked as mechanics and baggage handlers

sen lloyd bentsen says his senate finance 
committee will consider a wide array of proposals next year to 
encourage saving and investment including a cut in capital gains 
taxes 
expanded individual retirement accounts also will be considered 
as congress looks for ways to increase productivity and the 
nations ability to compete with foreign producers the texas 
democrat said wednesday in remarks prepared for a meeting of the 
tax foundation in new york 
with bentsen and senate majority leader george j mitchell 
dmaine leading the way congress this year defeated president 
bushs call for a reduction in taxes on capital gains profits from 
the sale of investments 
democratic leaders viewed the proposed reduction as a windfall 
for the rich the beginning of the undoing of the landmark 1986 tax 
overhaul and a deficitincreaser that would do little for the 
economy 
they responded with a plan to liberalize taxdeductible iras 
but withdrew that proposal when the capital gains cut failed

attorney general dick thornburgh says the man 
whom president bush is expected to name civil rights chief 
shouldnt be disqualified simply because hes a member of an 
allmale golf club 
thornburgh refused to discuss former new york state sen john r 
dunnes expected nomination to be assistant attorney general for 
civil rights saying that is a matter for the white house 
but the attorney general dismissed suggestions wednesday that 
dunnes membership in an allmale golf club would pose a problem 
mr dunne has indicated that if he is nominated by the 
president he will resign so i think he feels its inappropriate 
for the head of the civil rights division to belong to such a 
club 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said wednesday that dunne 
was the top candidate for the job 
sources at the white house speaking on condition of anonymity 
said they expected bush to nominate dunne a personal friend of the 
attorney general for 17 years 
the senate judiciary committee refused to approve bushs first 
nominee william c lucas after critics said he lacked 
professional experience for the job 
thornburgh said membership in allmale clubs doesnt disqualify 
candidates because we dont believe in litmus tests 
my objection is to a litmus test which says hat somebody 
because of any characteristic or any part of their background ought 
to be excluded the attorney general told reporters 
they ought to look at the whole record

president bushs weekend summit with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev should leave the superpowers 
better prepared to make substantial progress on a treaty to 
slash longrange nuclear weapons secretary of state james a baker 
iii said wednesday 
however he emphasized anew that no such agreement would be 
reached during the twoday meeting 
in a presummit news conference at the white house baker also 
said the democratic reforms that are bringing down eastern europes 
hardline communist regimes are the only path to longterm 
legitimacy and stability in the region and he warned against any 
crackdown by authorities 
while saying moscow has not stood in the way of the stunning 
changes baker declared we firmly believe that any attempts to 
forcibly intervene and prevent continued reform will be extremely 
destabilizing and dangerous 
he made a clear distinction between forcibly suppressing 
peaceful dissent and intervention by authorities to restore 
order such as in possible ethnic violence in the soviet union 
i see those as two distinctly different things baker said 
the secretary spoke on the eve of the presidents departure for 
the mediterranean island of malta bush and gorbachev will hold 
talks saturday and sunday on us and soviet warships anchored in 
maltas marsaxlokk bay 
in rome unidentified soviet officials quoted in thursday 
editions of the washington post told reporters gorbachev also would 
focus on arms questions with the aim of winning a commitment from 
bush for rapid progress on nuclear and conventional arms 
agreements including the establishment of a 1990 deadline for a 
treaty on strategic missiles clear statement 
bush spent wednesday preparing for his first meeting as 
president with gorbachev discussing the talks in a telephone 
conversation with west german chancellor helmut kohl 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the two 
leaders also talked about kohls new proposal tuesday for a 
confederation with east germany as a step toward eventual 
reunification 
on that point baker said if theres unification it should 
occur in the context of germanys continued alignment with nato and 
an increasingly integrated european community 
he ruled out any trade with moscow in which the two germanys 
would be reunited as a neutral government 
mindful of some reservations among us allies in europe baker 
said he preferred a gradual stepbystep process of bringing the 
two germanys together 
bush also planned to discuss the summit at a dinner with 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney 
at his news conference baker said bush would complain to 
gorbachev about what us officials say is a continuing flow of 
sovietmade weapons to the moscowbacked government of afghanistan 
as well as to leftist rebels in el salvador through nicaragua 
this pattern is a cold war relic baker said 
noting that soviet officials have promised to prevent nicaragua 
from shipping soviet arms to el salvador baker said either the 
nicaraguans are lying to the soviet union or the soviet union is 
lying to us 
we prefer to believe its the former 
baker said the malta meeting would not be an armscontrol 
summit emphasizing that no agreement would be reached either on 
longrange nuclear weapons or reductions in troops and conventional 
arms in europe 
however he said this meeting should permit us to be in much 
better shape and much better prepared to make substantial progress 
particularly on arms control at the fullblown summit scheduled 
next year in the united states 
us and soviet leaders have expressed hopes of signing an 
agreement at that later meeting to cut strategic weapons the 
deadliest arms in the superpowers arsenals by as much as 50 
percent 
this weekend baker said they will exchange new ideas but 
theyre not going to negotiate and theyre certainly not going to 
negotiate on anything that would involve our allies 
the secretary also said the two leaders would discuss steps the 
united states might take to improve economic relations with the 
soviet union such as waiving trade restrictions linked with soviet 
emigration and possible soviet participation in an international 
trading organization the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
gatt 
on capitol hill senate majority leader george mitchell prodded 
bush to waive the trade barriers known as the jacksonvanik 
amendment 
while i welcome the administrations offer to provide 
technical advice to the soviet union i believe a more meaningful 
response is necessary mitchell told a news conference 
at the white house baker hailed warmer ties between washington 
and moscow and said we want reforms in soviet domestic foreign 
and defense policy to succeed and we believe that the 
reformers are for real 
in an acknowledgement that the changes in eastern europe will be 
accompanied by hardships for its citizens baker said we are 
quite realistic about the staggering tasks which face the 
reformers 
however he said the important question for the united states 
is not whether gorbachevs reforms succeed or fail 
the real question is this do you engage the soviet union in a 
search for mutual advantage in this time of uncertainty and our 
answer to that question is a resounding yes

in his spacious apartment werner rhode 
reflected on the price of fleeing west more than two years 
separation from his wife and two sons starting over in his 40s 
and an enduring sense of isolation 
but id do exactly the same again i dont regret not 
waiting said rhode we won three years 
the pediatrician left east germany illegally in 1986 never 
expecting the communist government would permit freedom of travel 
in his lifetime 
now i feel a tremendous pride that i did what i did it was 
like moving a mountain with a shovel rhode said 
rhode was among the east germans who managed to escape before 
last summer when neighboring hungrary opened its borders and 
released a flood of east germans to the west 
on nov 9 east germanys communist leaders gave up scrapped 
travel restrictions and opened the berlin wall 
among the new westerners many are young and hopeful but some 
are disillusioned others like rhode 44 simply are determined to 
adapt buoyed daily by the memory of their desperation to leave 
east germany 
i dont think that anybody who has never lived there could 
ever understand rhode said i did not want my children to wind 
up in their 40s in the situation we were in it was like being a 
marionette constantly manipulated 
despite the changes including an amnesty for illegal emigrants 
declared in october rhode has no intention of going back and has 
not visited he believes his children now 14 and 16 have better 
opportunities in the west 
for two 23yearold east berlin secretaries who ducked out of a 
vacationing group in hungary and reached west berlin via austria in 
october life in the west consists of sharing a room in a refugee 
center with three other women 
they have never used computers and have little prospect of 
finding work or housing in january they are due to start a 
retraining course 
its disappointing said one kirsten senger who left with 
her best friend katrin mueller but if you want to succeed here 
its possible to fight your way through on the other side 
whatever you did somebody always closed a door 
if wed known what was going to happen i suppose wed have 
waited miss mueller but wed have been the first through the 
wall on nov 9 
miss mueller went home to visit east berlin soon after the wall 
opened and miss senger also plans a visit soon 
it was good to see my mother because leaving her without 
telling her i was going was the saddest thing ive ever known 
said miss mueller 
even with the hardships of adapting to their new lives neither 
wants to give up 
there was no hope in the east and authorities made promises 
they did not keep said miss mueller 
after repeated applications rhode who worked at a hospital in 
frankfurt an der oder along the border with poland got a fiveday 
exit visa in 1986 to visit relatives in west berlin 50 miles away 
his wife sabine a neurologist and their sons were not allowed 
to accompany him 
the couple agreed that rhode would not return knowing their 
telephone would be tapped and mail opened mrs rhode feigned 
amazement when her husband pretended to break the news in a 
telephone call 
secret police raided her apartment she was fined 20000 east 
german marks more than 10 times rhodes annual salary officials 
decided on the sum as representing half the stateassessed value of 
their property 
repeatedly mrs rhode was refused permission to leave 
they were granting some applications but highly skilled 
people had no chance said rhode there were times when i 
thought it was hopeless i promised her if things got too bad id 
go back even if it meant a year in jail 
suddenly on dec 28 1988 mrs rhode was told she could go 
that day i just picked up the children two suitcases and 
went she said 
in east germany the rhodes had a relatively good living 
standard an apartment at a nominal rent a car and more money 
than there were goods to buy 
their skills were in desperately short supply while west 
germany has a surplus of doctors some 1200 doctors are out of 
work in west berlin alone with numbers being swelled by emigres 
from the east 
rhode a senior consultant in east germany got a job as an 
assistant consultant at west berlins neukoelln hospital it pays 
5500 west german marks nearly 3000 a month after taxes 
he lived in a small apartment in the nurses quarters saving 
for the arrival of his family they now live in their own 
apartment which rents for 973 a month 
mrs rhode considers herself lucky to have found a job she 
works assessing accident victims disabilities for an insurance 
group and both speak with distaste of what they see as a 
mercenary attitude of many of their west german colleagues 
mrs rhode said some had suggested she should feel guilty about 
leaving patients behind in east germany 
they have no place to talk to me about feeling guilty she 
said here we see them cheating patients by giving them 
unnecessary treatment 
her husband cited instances when he said doctors see a 
patient four or five times when one or two appointments would do

injections of the natural diseasefighting protein 
interferon give doctors their first effective weapon against 
hepatitis c a virus that infects at least 150000 americans 
annually according to a report today 
in my opinion this is a major clinical advance said dr 
gary l davis of the university of florida 
the work appears to represent another milestone in a year of 
advances against this elusive virus until recently doctors were 
sure of only two hepatitis viruses type a and type b since many 
people got hepatitis without exposure to these viruses their 
disease was simply labeled nona nonb 
in april researchers from chiron corp in emeryville calif 
reported the discovery of a new hepatitis virus which they called 
hepatitis c they said it is the principal culprit in nona nonb 
hepatitis they also described a new test that will reveal whether 
blood is tainted with the virus 
hepatitis c is the most common serious infection that is passed 
through blood perhaps 5 percent of all americans who get routine 
transfusions become infected although estimates vary widely 
however this hazard should largely disappear soon when the new 
screening test for the virus becomes available perhaps next year 
most cases of hepatitis c are mild about half those infected 
become longterm carriers and 10 percent suffer cirrhosis of the 
liver 
the latest research involving 207 people shows that therapy 
with alpha interferon a human protein produced through genetic 
engineering can temporarily shut down the virus attack the 
treatment stopped the destruction of liver cells in about half of 
those with chronic disease however in more than half of those who 
are helped the disease returned when treatment ended 
researchers hope that giving interferon for longer period or in 
higher doses will hold the virus in check or wipe it out 
this is a very common disease said davis there has been 
nothing available for these people in the past while this controls 
the disease rather than cures it it is the first therapeutic 
intervention that has been offered these people 
it looks promising that antiviral treatment will be useful in 
this disease added dr jay h hoofnagle of the national 
institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases 
davis and hoofnagle were coauthors of separate studies that 
reached similar conclusions about interferons effectiveness both 
were published in the new england journal of medicine 
hepatitis b is spread mainly through blood and sexual contact 
and is a major underlying cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer 
blood banks also test donations for hepatitis a which usually 
spreads through contaminated food and water while it can cause 
serious illness people do not get lingering infections with 
hepatitis a 
hepatitis c virus is a vastly more common problem than hiv 
the aids virus and considerably more common than hepatitis b for 
which we have been testing for 20 years its the most common 
serious virus infection passed through transfusions said dr 
lewellys f barker head of blood services at the american red 
cross in washington 
in another report in the journal chiron scientists teamed with 
researchers from the department of transfusion medicine at the 
national institutes of health to strengthen the case that hepatitis 
c is the major and possibly the only cause of nona nonb 
hepatitis 
they tested 15 people who got nona nonb hepatitis through 
transfusions and found that all were infected with hepatitis c 
donors were also infected with this virus 
just how many americans get hepatitis c each year is unclear 
davis estimates that about 150000 of the 3 million americans who 
get transfusions annually become infected however the us 
centers for disease control uses a far lower estimate 
in an editorial in the journal the cdcs dr miriam j alter 
estimated that a total of 150000 americans get hepatitis c each 
year from all causes among these are 7500 to 15000 who catch it 
through transfusions 
the cdc estimates that 40 percent get the infection through drug 
abuse other sources include onthejob exposure to blood sexual 
intercourse and household contact with infected people however in 
about 40 percent of cases there is no clear explanation of how the 
infection occurs

nicolae ceausescus ringing rejection 
of reform is leaving him increasingly isolated as warsaw pact 
allies move toward democracy 
the supreme leader of romania renounced the reforms gripping the 
six other warsaw pact nations at his communist partys 14th 
congress last week 
instead he proclaimed a strengthened role for the party which 
already runs the most tightly controlled country in the soviet bloc 
the party cannot give up its responsibility he declared 
it cannot surender its historical mission to another force 
exppressing contempt for the political liberalization reshaping 
eastern europe ceausescu whose 24 years in power make him the 
most senior soviet bloc leader suggested that reformminded 
communist leaders elsewhere had betrayed their people 
the displays of orchestrated support from congress delegates did 
not gloss over the rapidly widening political gap between 
ceausescus romania and the soviet union poland hungary east 
germany bulgaria and czechoslovakia 
he has often been at odds with the kremlin rejecting the soviet 
lead in the 1970s at a time whent the rest of the warsaw pact was 
in lockstep with moscow 
now he is resolute in rejecting reform 
and in a new challenge ceausescu suggested in his congress 
speech that the soviet union give up control of territory gained 
through a preworld war ii pact with nazi germany that resulted in 
romania ceding bessarabia now soviet moldavia to its powerful 
neighbor 
distate for romania was evident in the fact that several 
countries including italy and warsaw pact ally hungary boycotted 
the congress a move which would have been an unheard of affront 
just five years ago 
the growing isolation of ceausescus romania also was reflected 
in the nearcomplete absence of the western camp from the congress 
chiefs of western diplomatic missions had attended past 
communist party congresses as a show of courtesy but the 14th 
congress was boycotted by the 12member european economic 
community all 16 nato nations save turkey most latin american 
democracies and almost all of europes neutral counries 
the issue was romanias poor human rights record which was 
ignored back in the 1970s when ceausescu was tweaking the 
russian bears tail said a diplomat who invoked the customary 
rules of anonymity 
the romanian leaders independent foreign policy decisions such 
as refusing to join other warsaw pact nations in invading 
czechoslovakia in 1968 or defying a soviet bloc boycott of the 
1984 los angeles summer olympics was met the with applause from 
the united states and its allies 
the cheers have turned to jeers however 
theyre being very consistent its the rest of the world 
thats changing canadian ambassador sol gray said of romania in 
the brightening rights picture in the rest of the soviet bloc 
romania is under growing attack for a rights record marred by 
severe travel restrictions no freedom of expression and strict 
limitation on the practice of religion 
fear of opposing ceausescu even appears to extend into the 
highest party echelons with senior officials seemingly restricted 
to carrying out the leaders decrees 
explaining the american decision to stay away from the congress 
the us embassy said it would be inconsistent with the depth of 
united states concern over the human rights situation in romania 
for which the romanian communist party bears responsibility 
romanian officials deny that ceausescus refusal to embrace 
change is leading to international isolation and point to what they 
say are vibrant ties with the developing world 
ceausescu seems to turn to increasingly to developing countries 
particularly those with a communist system similarly opposed to 
reform 
reporting on a meeting between ceausescu and chinese chief 
delegate qiao shi the romanian communist party daily scinteia said 
both sides expressed pleasure over the upward movement and 
constant gowth of ties 
similar language was used to describe ceausescus meetings with 
the head of the north korean and cuban delegations

the rice was bugged and were not talking 
wiretaps 
the sesame seeds had a problem too so did the apricots the 
bean curd and the macaroni in all city council president andrew 
stein said wednesday 15 of 17 imported foods his staff bought in 
the city and had tested at a private laboratory contained bugs or 
bug parts 
at a city hall news conference stein accused the federal food 
and drug administration of failing to enforce its food 
contamination standards he also said the standards themselves are 
too low 
most of the foods he had tested including 2 ounces of haitian 
milled corn with 26 insect fragments in it were within allowable 
federal standards but six were so badly tainted they violated the 
limits stein said 
among them he said were a 5pound bag of indian rice 
containing one live bug a red flour beetle and 11 whole dead 
ones including sawtoothed grain beetles and a rice weevil there 
was a dead moth in the chinese sesame seeds a rat or mouse hair in 
the chinese bean curd preserves and 481 insect fragments in the 
greek macaroni 
had they been properly inspected they would have been barred 
from sale in this country stein said he blamed federal budget 
cuts under the reagan administration that reduced the number of fda 
inspectors while food imports tripled 
the fda replied that it spends most of its time looking for food 
that contains microbiological contamination that could make people 
sick bugs while unappetizing generally do not pose a direct 
health threat said herman janiger an fda consumer affairs officer 
in brooklyn 
we do screen for filth in food but its possible that some 
can get by us janiger said

leftist rebels invaded parts of 
the capitals most affluent neighborhoods before dawn wednesday 
trapping many foreigners and dug in after fierce combat with 
government forces 
how many people had been killed in the latest guerrilla 
offensive was not clear eleven bodies of combatants were seen 
lying in the streets 
guerrillas briefly held a us embassy officers home officials 
in washington said they were also said to have seized the home of 
a french diplomat 
us embassy personnel were told not to report to work 
wednesday and the embassy was closed for the day white house 
spokesman roman popadiuk said in washington 
administration officials said no americans were injured and the 
rebels said in a statement that their fighters had been told not to 
attack americans 
a salvadoran foreign ministry official said rebels took over the 
japanese embassy which is four blocks from the home of us 
ambassador william walker but japan denied the report 
secretary of state james a baker iii said guerrillas briefly 
overran a an unidentified us embassy officers home the state 
department said the home apparently was seized at random 
the family was safely evacuated by salvadoran government 
forces and the family was not actually in the hands of the 
guerrillas at any time said david denny a department spokesman 
heavy and sustained fire was reported blocks from ambassador 
walkers home embassy spokesman jeff brown said walker was fine 
working in his office at the embassy 
denny said several families are unable to leave their homes 
because of fighting in their locations which included the 
neighborhoods of san benito escalon the capitals wealthiest 
late wednesday the rebel leadership proposed a sixhour truce 
thursday morning to evacuate foreigners from the neighborhoods 
there was no immediate public response from the government 
in a broadcast by their clandestine radio venceremos the rebels 
also said their fighters had captured the homes of three 
oligarchs but freed the occupants to show they are a 
responsible force fighting for democracy 
embassy spokesman barry jacobs said a charter flight might 
depart thursday with embassy dependents who want to leave el 
salvador and embassy personnel who planned to go home for 
christmas would leave early 
he said some dependents and other americans had moved into the 
heavily fortified embassy in downtown san salvador to get away from 
the fighting a few miles away 
the us embassy said there are about 8000 to 10000 us 
citizens in el salvador at any one time 
a salvadoran foreign ministry source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said guerrillas took over the japanese embassy and 
allowed relief workers to evacuate embassy personnel inside 
in tokyo a foreign ministry official said japanese staff at the 
governments liason office in el salvador reported street fighting 
in the neighborhood 
but there was no such thing as was reported in the press 
the official quoted the report as saying the official said no 
injuries were reported among people at the liaison office which is 
in the former japanese embassy in san salvador consular and 
embassy business for el salvador currently is handled by the 
japanese embassy in costa rica he said 
another diplomatic source said guerrillas had seized the 
residence of a french diplomat but allowed those inside to be 
evacuated he gave no details 
a home about a halfmile from walkers house was burned after 
having been taken over by rebels whether rebels burned the house 
or it caught fire as a result of fighting was not clear 
the guerrillas attacked workingclass districts of san salvador 
earlier this month in their biggest offensive of a 10yearold 
civil war that has killed more than 71000 people most of them 
civilians 
on wednesday radio venceremos said were already sitting in 
the oligarchys best mansions 
a statement from the rebel farabundo marti national liberation 
front said us personnel and buildings were not targets 
americans in the area should stay sheltered in their 
residences and if they come in contact with our forces they 
should identify themselves it said our units have 
instructions not to attack north american personnel 
fighting began well before dawn in san benito and escalon the 
capitals wealthiest residential areas most people stayed inside 
the comfortable homes which are surrounded by trees and 15foot 
walls as the chatter of assault rifles sounded in the winding 
streets 
it appeared about a dozen homes were taken over by the scores of 
insurgents who apparently came down from the san salvador volcano 
northwest of the city 
by taking this part we bring the war to the rich said the 
leader of a rebel squad behind a barricade of cars with their tires

continuing to make a symbolic and important statement about their 
ability to keep causing trouble through urban attacks but posed 
no threat to the government 
soldiers and rbels fought for hours around the official and 
private residences of president alfredo cristiani both in escalon 
reporters saw a light tank destroyed in escalon by 
rocketpropelled grenades the bodies of six soldiers lay around 
the charred vehicle 
the bodies of at least five guerrillas were seen in escalon and 
in the la sultana and guadalupe neighborhoods of southwestern san 
salvador which also were attacked 
helicopters and spotter planes strafed and rocketed suspected 
rebel positions in sultana and guadalupe but not in escalon or san 
benito 
last week insurgents briefly took over the blocks surrounding a 
luxury hotel in escalon they said escalon was chosen as an 
objective because the government would not use warplanes in rich 
neighborhoods as it had in the workingclass districts of 
mejicanos and soyapango 
residents of the poor districts in northern and eastern san 
salvador reported many civilians killed or wounded by air attacks 
the insurgent radio also reported a mortar attack wednesday on

ousted communist party chief milos 
jakes says he planned to bring democratic reforms to his country in 
december and was simply overtaken by popular unrest that spread 
with breathtaking speed 
the former hardline leader said the massive daily 
demonstrations and ultimately his downfall were spurred by an 
erroneous report that police had killed a student demonstrator 
jakes 67 said he opposed the police brutality that sparked the 
mass revolt against his rule riot police on nov 17 clubbed 
hundreds of peaceful demonstrators in downtown prague 
theres always some impulse or other to popular revolt 
jakes said here the impulse was the events of nov 17 it was a 
tragedy 
we didnt want such an intervention by the police he said 
claiming he opposed it along with the interior minister frantisek 
kincl he refused to say who was responsible 
then the news about the socalled death of a participant 
electrified the students and set them in motion this news proved 
to be a lie but the landslide was already moving jakes said 
matteroffactly 
on nov 18 rumors swept prague that a mathematics student 
identified as martin smid had died when police beat peaceful 
students on a city street 
dissident petr uhl was arrested a day later for putting out the 
report based on the statement of a woman who visited fellow 
dissident vaclav benda and claimed her fiance martin smid had 
died in the violence 
the government frantically tried to shoot down the rumors even 
showing two men named martin smid on television 
uhl publicly apologized for the false report at a mass rally on 
sunday hours after communist authorities released him from jail 
under pressure from the opposition 
by then the antigovernment rallies were attracting hundreds of 
thousands of people and events had spun out of the governments 
control 
change had been coming anyway said jakes who spoke with three 
western reporters wednesday during a break in parliament which 
amended the constitution to eliminate the communists 40year 
monopoly on power 
we were going to create space for democracy but events moved 
quicker than we planned so now we have to take these measures 
under more complicated conditions 
jakes smiling and composed defended his record as party boss 
with the air of a man unable to drink in the momentous changes of 
the past 11 days 
the communist party he said had planned to introduce 
democratic reforms of its own at a december meeting of its 
policymaking central committee but then the mass rallies forced 
immediate leadership changes and concessions 
his claim echoes similar recent claims by many east german 
communists that they had always favored change but were blocked at 
the top 
in both countries citizens who remember four decades of broken 
communist promises are skeptical of such statements 
jakes a communist steeped in party work for more than four 
decades seemed unable to believe that the party could lose power 
if it goes ahead with the free elections a politburo member said 
wednesday were likely within a year 
the mass demonstrations of recent days have concerned only a 
small part of the country he said contradicting a report in 
tuesdays communist party daily rude pravo that said every 
layer of society was involved in mondays general strike called 
by the opposition 
jakes said he favored removing the communists leading role from 
the constitution a key opposition demand 
enshrining the leading role in the constitution damaged our 
interests jakes said life has shown that it was not important 
whether the leading role was written down somewhere or not what is 
important is how we win trust in life 
jakes admission was surprising in the light of his close links 
to the crackdown on reform after the 1968 warsaw pact invasion that 
snuffed out alexander dubceks glorious prague spring 
for 21 years jakes president gustav husak and other party 
leaders resisted the reform they were installed by moscow to 
suppress but which took hold of the soviet union after mikhail s 
gorbachev came to power in 1985 
jakes denied any responsibility for creating the current crisis 
in czechoslovakia and also said soviet officials played no role in 
the stunning events of the past week 
while sanguine about what he called the damaged prestige of the 
party jakes signaled the communists are not going to cave in to 
all the opposition demands 
the civic forum opposition movement has demanded husaks 
resignation by dec 10 but jakes said civic forum as an unelected 
body cannot usurp this right from parliament which under the 
constitution appoints the president 
he also opposed civic forum demands to disband the partys 
paramilitary force 
jakes dumped from the ruling politburo on friday after the mass 
demonstrations gathered steam was asked how he felt about the 
chants heard against him heard at the prodemocracy rallies 
he sighed and said i have always worked honestly my whole 
life and i worked not for myself but for society you cant feel 
happy but this is what happens in politics

the playboy of the western world 
arrived in the the east bloc today unveiling american women to a 
nation more concerned with shedding communism 
a hungarian version of the mens magazine hit the stands today 
playboy debuted the edition wednesday at a news conference that was 
the best attended since president bush visited hungary in july 
the star attraction was decembers playmate of the month 
american pia reyes who told reporters she hoped she is 
recognized with clothes on 
hungary apparently was chosen for the first east bloc edition 
because of its liberal cultural and political climate this year 
the communist party disbanded and reformminded leaders have 
promised free elections by june 
in the maiden hungarian edition playboy founder hugh hefner 
wrote the hungarian people can now enjoy the same democratic 
freedom which playboy has always championed 
playboy however isnt likely to shock hungarians the way it 
did americans in the 1950s the past year has seen a rash of 
softcore pornography appearing at budapest kiosks 
there are no pornography statutes on the books in hungary but 
customs officials did routinely confiscate such magazines until 
1983 
the hungarian edition of playboy will have an initial printing 
of 95000 copies and will sell for 197 forints or about 3 a 
steep price in a country where the average monthly salary is about 
6000 forints or 100 
the hungarian playboy a joint venture between playboy 
enterprises inc of chicago and hungarian entrepreneurs will carry 
locally generated material as well as photo spreads and features 
from the american editions 
hungarian editor dezsoe futasz said there were no plans yet to 
feature a hungarian playmate of the month because of the higher 
standards of photography available from the us edition 
the hungarian playboy marks the 13th national edition and the 
11th language in which the magazine is published said playboy 
spokesman william stocken 
during the news conference a reporter from the soviet news 
agency tass asked about a possible soviet edition to which stocken 
replied that we are open to a business venture with the 
ussr 
miss december had a chance to clear up an error in the text 
accompanying her hungarian debut she likes leather and lingerie 
not as the hungarian text has it leather lingerie

americans give mikhail gorbachev more credit 
than president bush for lessening eastwest tensions and nearly 
eight in 10 believe the soviet leader seeks true reform in his 
country according to a poll 
the media generalassociated press survey found suspicions of 
the soviet unions intentions fading rapidly with a majority of 
americans now convinced that the soviets do not seek world 
domination 
bush and gorbachev who are meeting in a shipboard summit off 
malta this weekend won exceedingly high popularity marks with 
roughly seven in 10 respondents rating each favorably 
their summit comes at a time of momentous change in the 
communist world while gorbachev pushes reforms in the soviet 
union his eastern european allies in recent weeks have moved 
dramatically away from political domination by their communist 
parties 
forty percent of the 1117 adults surveyed nov 1725 in the 
continental united states rated bush as too cautious in 
encouraging reform in the eastern bloc 46 percent said he was 
doing enough the rest were unsure 
moreover 41 percent said gorbachev has done more than bush to 
ease tensions compared with 29 percent who said bush has done 
more the others werent sure 
to encourage soviet reforms respondents by 21 favored 
establishing normal trade relations a step the bush 
administration is exploring a less likely move foreign aid was 
opposed by seven in 10 
goodwill toward gorbachev aside the poll found lingering doubt 
about soviet reliability fiftythree percent said the soviets 
cannot be trusted to live up to it arms control agreements down 
from 61 percent in a poll last year but still a majority 
reflecting that cautious view 52 percent opposed making 
significant cuts in us military spending because of lessened 
tensions the bush administration is contemplating large cuts in 
its military budget 
similarly respondents split on whether the united states should 
remove all its troops from western europe if the soviets removed 
theirs from eastern europe fortyseven percent favored such a deal 
and 42 percent were opposed a division within the polls 3point 
error margin the rest were unsure 
respondents overwhelmingly opposed immediate cuts in us troops 
in europe as a response to the reforms but among those who were 
opposed a majority favored reductions later if reforms continue 
while the respondents favored continued defense efforts just 35 
percent said they believed the soviets seek to dominate the world 
down from 50 percent who held that view in a cbs newsnew york 
times poll last spring 
fiftyseven percent in the new survey rejected the notion that 
the soviets seek world domination with the rest unsure 
despite the split opinion on bushs encouragement of communist 
changes 74 percent approved of his overall handling of ussoviet 
relations seventy percent had a favorable opinion of bush in 
general 
sixtyeight percent had a favorable view of gorbachev virtually 
the same rating as bushs and well up from 54 percent in a media 
generalap poll in april 1988 before a summit between gorbachev 
and thenpresident reagan 
gorbachev was more popular than bush 85 percent to 65 percent 
among respondents with postgraduate educations gorbachev also 
outscored reagan among this group in 1988 
high regard for gorbachev translated into a generally optimistic 
view of his chances for success among the 77 percent who believe 
he wants meaningful reform in the soviet union 60 percent expected 
him to succeed 15 percent said he is likely to fail and a quarter 
were unsure of the outcome

you can shear a lamb every year but you can only skin it 
once billie sol estes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on the eve of his release from prison 
in 1983 texas flimflam artist billie sol estes said his wheeling 
and dealing days were over 
the problem wasnt that he was crooked estes confided to a 
reporter but compulsive 
im just one drink away from being a drunk and just one deal 
away from being back in prison sighed the former west texas 
millionaire whose friendship with president johnson eroded after an 
historic fertilizer tank scandal in the 1960s 
now at age 64 the states most colorfully persistent con man 
is back in trouble indicted with five others and a defunct 
corporation on charges of stealing trade secrets 
he posted 10000 bail tuesday in brady and was released along 
with three codefendants 
estes dropped out of sight and attempts wednesday to contact 
him through friends and family were unsuccessful in 1987 he moved 
to brady from his longtime home in abilene 
mcculloch county district attorney ron sutton said estes and his 
associates face a dec 7 arraignment on felony charges of engaging 
in criminal activity a scheme to form a company with plans that 
had been stolen from another firm 
the indictment sets out that he kind of came th the idea 
sutton said 
ive always been able to make money estes bragged in an 
interview in the current issue of texas monthly magazine if i 
put my mind to it i could make a million in the next 30 days 
estes went on to say 
me ive never cared about money i love puttials together and 
watching them run for some people money is death you might as 
well give th a loaded 45 pistol and point it right at thei 
this is the billie sol who after promis 1983 that his fast buck 
deals were a thing of past outlined a grand scheme to corner the 
wirket by growing grapes in the west texas desertwe could truly 
move the wine business from fr to west texas and ive got some 
people who woike for me to go out there and do that he sa now 
he says if he had money he would put itjapanese stock market 
this is the billie who once told a reporter 
you can shear mb every year but you can only skin it once 
a running texas joke is that it takes a gooindler to make 
millions peddling cow manure bureat one like estes to amass a 
fortune selling antom cow manure 
and thats what got estesble in 1963 
he was convicted of federal ma fraud and conspiracy in a 
multimilliondollar involving phony financial statements and 
nonexnt fertilizer tanks 
the paper empire was propped up with federal agricultural loans 
a cus arrangement that critics later maintained coulbe traced to 
billie sols ties with fellow texaon johnson 
estes was a johnson confidant anancial contributor as far back 
as johnsons uays 
the extent of the relationship is debathe late presidents 
associates insist it was nster bonding that estes implied 
estes wasom prison the first time in 1971 after serving years of 
a 15year term after being convicted o and conspiracy to conceal 
assets from the intenue service his parole was revoked in 1979 
ande was sentenced to 10 more years 
he was red from the federal prison at big spring in 1983 while 
admittedly a dedicated swindler the fliestes is only slightly less 
interesting and decdly more noble he is a tireless worker for 
thepoor and has used his own money and fundraising abilities to 
feed and educate the needy black white or hispanic 
he was an advocate of school integration in texas lore it was 
fashionable 
estes told texas mo that when he dies he wants only one thing on 
his tombstone he did all that he could to help the poor 
in the interview estes denied any wrongdoing in the brady 
affair but said i suppose ill be under investigation about one 
thing or another for the rest of my life 
and what if he goes back to prison a third time 
if i do i guess thats part of my diny 
moments later he added bring on the indictments lets

leaders of a centrist coalition seeking 
to form indias first minority government said today they believe 
their reluctant leader will yet become prime minister 
vishwanath pratap singh head of the fiveparty national front 
coalition has maintained he is not interested in replacing prime 
minister rajiv gandhi but his colleagues say he has no choice in 
the matter 
he has to bow to the wishes of the people and the party 
said mohan guruswamy an associate of singh he has no 
alternative 
guruswamy said another contender for the post chandra shekhar 
was persuaded wednesday night to withdraw guruswamy claimed no one 
in the coalition would contest singhs nomination 
singh who as late as tuesday said he would not accept office in 
the new government could not be reached for comment 
gandhi resigned wednesday after his congress party failed to win 
a majority in last weeks parliamentary polls but he was asked by 
president ramaswamy venkataraman to continue until a new government 
is formed 
results of 521 of the 525 seat at stake in the elections had 
been announced by today and the congress emerged as the single 
largest party with 191 its smallparty allies got another 17 seats 
the national front has 143 but has been promised support by the 
rightwing bharatiya janata party which has 88 seats and by a 
coalition of leftwing groups which won 51 constituencies 
that would give the national front and its tacit allies a total 
of 282 seats enough to carry a vote if there are no defections 
the rest of the parliament seats went to small parties and 
independents who have not specified whether they would support a 
national front government 
singh is not sure he will be able to handle a hung house 
said a senior leader of the national front speaking on condition 
of anonymity thats why he was so hesitant to become the prime 
minister 
singh was told he has no business to be in politics if he does 
not seek office said another source in the national front 
referring to meetings held by the coalition on wednesday night 
the national fronts parliament members are to meet friday to 
elect their leader who would likely be asked by the president to 
become prime minister if the national front leader cannot win a 
vote of confidence in parliament which takes a simple majority of 
263 he will have to resign as prime minister 
under the indian constitution the president decides who will be 
asked to form a government in past elections one party always 
emerged with a comfortable majority in the absence of such a 
majority the president is free to choose the party he considers 
the most capable of forming a government 
the congress party has said it will not stake a claim to form 
the government gandhi said he will lead the new opposition 
singh a former defense and finance minister is the bestknown 
leader in the national front but the 58yearold politician has 
said he just wants to be president of the janata dal or peoples 
party the largest component of the coalition

greenpeace activists in 
inflatable boats battled raging seas and freezing temperatures in 
antarctica today to stop a soviet factory trawler from fishing the 
environmental group said 
it said three inflatables were launched from the greenpeace ship 
gondwana stationed off south georgia in the south atlantic where 
the group claims the soviets are overfishing 
the group in a statement said the seven activists steered the 
inflatables on board the soviet factory trawler mikjail verbitzkiy 
after a wild ride 
it said the soviet ship was attempting to put out nets when 
gondwana approached and lowered the inflatable boats the 
inflatables reportedly stayed with the ship for three hours despite 
10foot swells 
the statement said greenpeace radioed the soviet captain in 
both english and russian explaining the reasons for the 
nonviolent protest 
at one point the inflatables actually landed on the stern ramp 
blocking the trawling operation 
for the last 20 years the antarctic ecosystem has been 
plundered by indiscriminate fishing especially by the soviet union 
in the south georgia area and now these stocks are commercially 
extinct said greenpeace antarctic program coodinator maj de 
poorter 
she said the whole ecological balance was at risk as the fish 
are food for penguins seabords seals and whales 
greenpeace as part of its campaign to have antarctica declared 
a world park is demanding a moratorium on all fishing south of the 
antarctic convergence until stocks have recovered 
the great whales that once populated this area are gone now 
the fish are going de poorter said greenpeace will not simply 
stand by and watch

three weeks before the finale of the rolling 
stones steel wheels concert tour mick jagger and keith 
richards are proud of the bands newfound discipline and its 
trainload of money 
ive never seen the boys so serious richards said 
wednesday everyone is really conserving their energy for the 
shows instead of like 10 to 15 years ago when we would have like 
been up three or four days in a row things change 
since opening the 60show north american tour aug 31 in 
philadelphia the 25yearold rock band consistently has drawn 
sellout crowds despite admittedly bad acoustics in stadiums such as 
the metrodome in minneapolis the stones play there tonight for the 
second time 
by the time the tour grinds to a halt dec 20 in atlantic city 
nj more than 3 million concertgoers will have oiled the steel 
wheels machine with about 80 million 
and that doesnt count souvenir sales corporate sponsorship 
from budweiser and mtv a line of stones clothing album proceeds 
and the multimilliondollar payoff at the end of the tour from a 
live payperview television concert with eric clapton guns n 
roses stars axl rose and izzy stradlin and others 
im very proud of the way its financially run because i have 
a lot to do with it the 46yearold jagger said in an interview 
before wednesdays show but im also very proud of the fact that 
we do spend a tremendous amount of money on production 
the overhead includes a 300member entourage stadium rentals 
jagger describes as sometimes unreasonable and two huge stage 
sets loaded with pyrotechnics the larger of which will not fit 
into many stadiums 
asked about the accuracy of published estimates that each of the 
five band members will net 18 million jagger said many of the 
estimates have been inflated twice or three times 
america is besot with money its always been besot by 
money the singer said people like juggling figures around i 
certainly dont know what the end numbers will be and if i did i 
certainly wouldnt tell you 
richards 45 said hes not bothered by americas obsession with 
the tours bottom line 
the stones have incredible timing theyve always had 
timing richards said of course everyone has done very well 
out of it but then why shouldnt they they are the best 
the guitar player said steel wheels is the most demanding 
stones tour he can remember the 2hour show is the bands longest 
ever and four shows a week leave little room to play richards said 
in addition a more complicated sound system is requiring the

serbias conservative leaders have 
called for a complete severing of political and commercial ties 
with liberalminded slovenia in a volatile dispute that threatens 
to break up communist yugoslavia 
western diplomats called the move wednesday a possible first 
step in the disintegration of the state a loose federation of six 
republics and two provinces peopled by several different 
nationalities and religious groups 
the nationalist dispute carries heavy ideological overtones 
serbia to the east is controlled by hardline communists while 
slovenia to the north is led by liberals who back moves toward 
democracy and less state control of the economy 
tensions between the two republics have been heightened by 
sinking living standards as the federal government copes with 
economic troubles that have in the past year bred soaring inflation 
and in turn serious labor unrest 
the serbian socialist alliance a communistled mass movement 
that serves as a mouthpiece for the republics populist leader 
slobodan milosevic issued the call wednesday for all enterprises 
and organizations in serbia to sever all contacts with slovenia 
the move followed emergency measures taken by slovenian 
authorities to block a mass rally planned for friday by serbian 
nationalists in ljubljana slovenias capital who apparently hope 
to topple the slovenian leadership 
the rally was to protest purported harassment of the serbian 
minority in southern kosovo province by members of the ethnic 
albanian majority 
the protesters claim the slovenian leadership supports the 
ethnic albanians kosovo is a nominally autonomous province but 
serbia exercises some control over it 
fridays rally was called off soon after the socialist alliance 
announced the break but many of the at least 40000 protesters who 
were to have traveled to ljubljana from serbia for the gathering 
had already left by wednesday and could defy the rally ban their 
plans were not immediately clear 
wednesday was a holiday marking the 46th anniversary of 
communist rule in yugoslavia 
the row brings to a head a long series of disputes between 
slovenia which is setting up a multiparty democracy and the 
serbian leadership which advocates continued communist rule and a 
strongly centralized federal system 
serbia the nations largest republic has repeatedly attempted 
to impose an informal economic boycott against slovenia which is 
the countrys most developed region 
slovenia contributes almost a quarter of the gross national 
product and a third of the exports of yugoslavia whose 24 million 
people include nine million serbs and two million slovenes 
the socialist alliances proclamation said serbs will no longer 
allow themselves to be humiliated by a slovenia in which all 
freedoms and human rights have been suspended 
the statement described the slovenian demonstration ban as a 
crime against justice and truth adding that the serbian people 
would not accept such an act 
a news report on ljubljana television described serbias move as 
senseless saying the serbian leadership has sunk to the 
lowest possible moral and political level 
the countrys constitution in theory allows for its republics to 
break away from the federation 
slovenia recently adopted amendments to its charter explicitly 
giving the region the right to secede if the majority of its 
residents so desire 
slovenian politicians and the republics vocal media have 
suggested serbian leaders want to provoke a showdown to impose 
their own ideological orthodoxy on all of yugoslavia and prevent 
the establishment of a multiparty system 
the serbian move is the result of milosevics dictatorial 
policies said a commentary on ljubljana television 
the dispute comes in advance of a january congress of the ruling 
communist party that is expected to lead to constitutional changes 
that could grant countrys member republics even wider political 
autonomy 
the other four republics have introduced varying degrees of 
democracy over the past year while remaining on the sidelines of 
the conflict between serbia and slovenia

to el salvador on behalf of the remaining church workers including 
the rev jose serrano rector of st john the evangelist 
a statement signed wednesday by nine religious leaders 
including browning said washington has not done enough to change 
the salvadoran government 
the focus at this moment must be on the immediate cessation of 
hostilities directed at the churches including the release of all 
those now being held in detention the statement said 
st john the evangelist was one of at least seven churches or 
church schools in el salvador raided by security forces on nov 19 
and 20 us ambassador william walker blamed the raids on overly 
aggressive security forces and suggested president alfredo 
cristiani was having management control problems with extremist 
elements of his government 
two weeks ago six jesuit priests including the rector and vice 
rector of the countrys central american university were slain 
fellow jesuits blamed the killings on government soldiers and the 
government promised to investigate

the national league of cities says it wants the 
federal government to stop talking about giving money to help 
battle drugs and start passing it out 
the organization representing 1400 municipalities wrapped up 
its fiveday convention wednesday by also asking the federal 
government for more help in dealing with aids adopting a policy 
supporting a ban on automatic assaulttype weapons and calling for 
us sanctions against south africa 
fort worth texas mayor bob bolen was elected president of the 
organization for 1990 
congress continues to enact antidrug legislation without 
providing significant resources to our cities the level of 
government that deals most directly with our young people said a 
resolution passed by league delegates 
the resolution asked for 3 billion for local antidrug efforts 
the chief components of the increased federal funding should be 
treatment and education programs for young people the resolution 
said 
in a policy statement the league said antidrug efforts should 
include programs aimed at reducing abuse of legal drugs such 
as alcohol and cigarettes 
in other business the league called on cities to adopt 
antidiscrimination measures regarding people with acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome but said local officials can give little 
concrete help to aids victims unless the government provides more 
financial support 
unless the federal government plays a major financial role in 
the national public health emergency of aids the state and local 
governments hands are tied the organization said 
the league also urged a ban on the manufacture sale and 
importation of all automatic and semiautomatic assaulttype 
weapons except for the military and police 
the league further called for a 30day waiting period for the 
purchase or transfer of all guns 
previous league policy supported only a ban on the sale or 
criminal use of armorpiercing handgun bullets a motion to amend 
league policy to support registration of all guns failed 
on south africa the organization approved a resolution 
criticizing the us policy of constructive engagement toward 
apartheid the resolution backed federal sanctions against south 
africas government and urged cities to withdraw funds and cease 
investment in that nation

hunters are killing too many bears in 
maine say game officials who want to cut the threemonth season by 
four weeks 
the black bear head count likely will reach a record 2700 by 
the end of the season thursday said craig r mclaughlin of the 
maine inland fisheries and wildlife department the harvest has 
been creeping upward since 1985 when 1533 were shot to 2651 
last year 
maine currently has an estimated 17000 to 20000 bears 
department biologist ken elowe said the optimum level is 21000 
mclaughlin said 
our bear population is by no means in trouble said 
mclaughlin who noted the state still has the largest bear 
population east of the mississippi river 
but if the population is to get back to the target the seasonal 
harvest must be cut to no more than 2100 he said 
william vail the state fish and wildlife commissioner said 
the increasing harvest trend is likely setting the stage for 
further and more dramatic declines in the population 
vail wants to eliminate four weeks of bear hunting in 1990 and 
1991 
bears roam every section of the state except the more heavily 
populated southern coastal region mclaughlin said 
when food is scarce usually in the summer when they are eating 
the most bears occasionally wander into towns and dumps looking 
for food 
they have been known to peer inside screen doors in the northern 
maine hunting outpost of greenville and as many as three have been 
spotted within the city limits of the state capital augusta 
within a single summer said paul fournier spokesman for the game 
department 
but black bears are intelligent and secretive and no easy prey 
for hunters mclaughlin said the bears normally weigh 250 pounds 
fully grown and occasionally weigh more than 500 pounds yet they 
are surprisingly quick he said 
officials say bear hunters also may be attracted by what they 
see as a macho experience 
they know they can come to maine and have a quality hunt 
said fournier 
officials do not know exactly how many bear hunters there are in 
maine since the state does not issue special bear permits 
but the word we get from the field is that theyre getting in 
each others way a little more mclaughlin said 
the state has scheduled three public hearings in december to get 
reaction from hunters guides and others to the proposal to shorten 
the hunting season

passengers who cowered in the rear of an eastern 
airlines jet as it hobbled in on two of its three sets of tires 
felt death was certain but said the landing was smoother than 
others they experienced 
some were so relieved they raced off the crippled boeing 727 
for connecting flights at hartsfield atlanta international airport 
i figure it cant possibly happen to another plane tonight so 
im going on said jahnn gibson 40 of saratoga ny who was 
making her first flight wednesday 
eastern spokesman jim ashlock said none of the 43 passengers and 
seven crew members were injured 
the right main landing gear jammed while retracting after 
takeoff from albany ny eastern officials said it appeared a 
damaged tire tread jammed the extending mechanism when it separated 
from the tire during the takeoff 
after talking with ground technicians the pilot capt william 
bundrant circled the atlanta airport moving from side to side and 
up and down in an attempt to shake the landing gear loose 
i was terrified said erika celella 33 of ballston spa 
ny they told us all to get to the back of the plane then they 
screamed take any seat and i knew we were all dead 
with less than onethird of the planes capacity of 149 the 
passengers could fit in the tail of the plane where they crouched 
heads down and arms over their heads 
mrs gibson said children cried their parents prayed and many 
kept muttering oh my god oh my god as the jet approached 
the runway 
but to everyones astonishment the landing was smoother than 
a regular landing said ellen kemp 30 of albany ny who was 
traveling with her three children ages 9 2 and 8 months 
i couldnt believe how easy he set it down it was better than 
most normal landings ive been through said susan winfree who 
was traveling with her 3monthold daughter casey it made a 
little more noise but thats all 
the right wing touched the ground as it rolled to a stop 
causing only minor damage said arlene salac a federal aviation 
administration spokeswoman 
bundrant 51 an atlantabased pilot with 23 years experience 
at eastern brought the plane to a screeching grinding halt amid a 
shower of firesuppressing foam from fire trucks 
ms celella said flight attendants were screaming get out 
get out and we could smell chemicals that we thought was fuel 
but was really the foam we thought it was going to blow up 
terrified passengers scrambled down a rear staircase 
i didnt know i could move that fast said olive tracey 66 
who was on her way home to dade city fla after spending 
thanksgiving with her children i think i was outrunning some of 
those younger people getting away from that plane 
an eastern spokeswoman said that the continued strike by its 
machinists had no bearing on the incident 
the landing problem was certainly was not because a plane had 
not been worked on by licensed skilled mechanics said gloria 
prance an executive assistant at eastern

a man who killed a state trooper as a 
teenager won a ninth stay of execution when the us supreme court 
said it needed more time to decide whether to hear his formal 
appeal 
dalton prejean was to have died today in the electric chair for 
the second murder he committed as a teenager the 1977 shooting 
of donald cleveland cleveland was the only louisiana state trooper 
ever murdered while on duty 
prejean was 17 when he shot cleveland in the face after being 
stopped for driving with a broken tail light prejean had been 
freed six months earlier from a juvenile detention center where he 
served time for killing a taxi driver when he was 14 
he would have been the first person executed after the us 
supreme courts ruling in june that authorized executions of people 
who commit capital crimes while they were 16 or 17 
prejean 9 days from his 30th birthday has been on louisianas 
death row longer than any other inmate 
just eight hours before his scheduled execution the supreme 
court said it needed more time to decide whether to hear prejeans 
formal appeal to set aside his death penalty no date has been set 
for the courts action on the appeal 
on tuesday gov buddy roemer rejected the state pardon boards 
32 recommendation that prejeans sentence be commuted to life 
imprisonment soon afterward the 5th us circuit court of appeals 
denied a ninth stay of execution 
death penalty opponents made prejeans case a national cause 
celebre saying he should be spared because he was nearly retarded 
with an iq of 76 and because he was so young when he killed the 
trooper 
the 5th circuit said he is not retarded under standards of the 
american association on mental retardation which sets the 
threshhold at an iq of 70 
prejean would have been the 19th person executed in louisiana 
since the supreme court upheld the death penalty in 1976 
nationwide 119 people have been put to death

suspended navajo chairman peter 
macdonald has pleaded innocent to 107 criminal counts but his son 
also facing tribal charges failed to appear for his arraignment 
judge robert yazzie of the tribes window rock district court 
rejected the prosecutions motion for a 400000 bond and released 
the elder macdonald on his own recognizance wednesday a 
prosecution request that macdonald be required to surrender his 
passport also was denied 
yazzie did not set a trial date but tentatively scheduled a 
pretrial hearing for jan 29 
meanwhile special prosecutor mark donatelli said he would apply 
today for an arrest warrant to have macdonalds son peter 
macdonald jr brought to the reservation 
the elder macdonald the leader of the nations biggest indian 
tribe was charged oct 11 by special prosecutors hired by the 
tribe with 107 offenses including conspiracy bribery fraud 
extortion and electionlaw violations 
the 60yearold macdonald who was suspended by the tribal 
council in february also is the target of a federal grand jury 
investigation in phoenix and a defendant in a multimilliondollar 
lawsuit filed by the 225000member tribe in a state court 
the lawsuit and most of the criminal charges focus on the 
tribes 1987 purchase of an arizona ranch for 72 million more 
than the sellers had paid for it minutes earlier 
suspended vice chairman johnnie r thompson and macdonalds 
son also were charged thompson pleaded innocent nov 17 to 15 
electionlaw violations 
donald benally an attorney for the younger macdonald filed a 
motion on wednesday asking that the charges be dismissed benally 
challenged the tribal courts jurisdiction noting that his client 
has lived recently in phoenix and san jose calif 
in seeking a 400000 bond for the elder macdonald special 
prosecutors said he was a flight risk and posed a danger to the 
community 
macdonald may take this opportunity to flee the country and 
get at money in foreign countries donatelli said the time for 
him to leave the country is quickly disappearing 
macdonald scoffed at the prosecutions contention 
im a good citizen of the navajo nation he said i have 
no plans to take a flight anywhere 
allegations emerged in testimony before the us senate select 
committee on indian affairs in january that macdonald personally 
profited from the tribes purchase of the big boquillas ranch from 
byron t brown and k tom tracey two longtime friends of 
macdonalds 
the tribe paid 334 million for the ranch within minutes after 
brown and tracey had purchased it for 262 million 
brown told the senate panel that macdonald received 50000 plus 
vacation trips and lease of a bmw automobile 
in august the tribe filed a 24 million lawsuit in state court 
against macdonald and others over the ranch purchase 
the 88member tribal council placed macdonald on administrative 
leave in february following the senate hearings

a 6 million lake project was derailed 
after state officials discovered the site harbored roosts for the 
endangered indiana bat 
the state called a halt to the recreation project after the 
discovery of 39 indiana bat roosts at the 800acre lake site 
officials said wednesday 
previously only three trees in the united states were known to 
serve as roosts for the winged mammals in the summer when they 
give birth 
this project would have a devastating impact on this species 
of bat said jim garner manager of the illinois department of 
conservations endangered and threatened species conservation 
program 
garner said wednesday that 12 roosting sites or trees would 
have been lost if the lake was built 
the indiana bat very similar to the common little brown 
bat feeds strictly on insects garner said 
male indiana bats summer in a variety of eastern us locales 
he said 
but the females roost and give birth in only a few spots 
indiana bats return each year to the same nest as long as it 
remains undisturbed he said and anywhere from a dozen to a 
hundred bats will roost in a single tree 
they have a tendency to roost in trees which have bark that 
flakes away garner said they climb underneath the bark and 
have their babies its one of their most unique characteristics 
seven caves in indiana missouri and kentucky provide winter 
shelter for 90 percent of the estimated 350000 surviving indiana 
bats officials have determined 
each cave is federally protected against private or public 
development 
concerns about the indiana bat also were cited during federal 
consideration of sites proposed in illinois michigan and tennessee 
for the multibilliondollar superconducting super collider project 
eventually awarded to texas 
garner and his staff pinpointed the roosts near the proposed 
lake project in western illinois by stringing nets across fishhook 
creek to catch the bats as they flew upstream each bat was fitted 
with a miniature radio transmitter that led scientists back to 
their roosts 
the lake project would have expanded siloam springs state park 
by 2400 acres and created an 800acre lake 
state rep jeffery mays who proposed the project said the 
3300acre park does not have a suitable site for a large lake and 
its 56acre lake is silting in and hasnt been stocked in 20 years 
its a beautiful park but it needs a decentsized lake to 
really get things going mays said i envisioned a lodge and 
camping facilities but thats history now 
it was not the first time a project has been stalled for

the discovery of what officials believed to 
be a bomb inside a suitcase headed for a colombian jetliner turned 
out to be a video game bought as a christmas gift 
only after the suitcase was blown up by a police bomb squad did 
experts determine that the suspected explosive device was a video 
game and the owner is angry 
carlos arias said the game was a christmas gift for his nephews 
in bogota he said his niece was taking the suitcase that also 
contained christmas cards other gifts and money on a christmas 
trip to colombia 
i asked why they had to blow it up arias said they 
didnt have to the name address and phone for my niece were on 
the suitcase they could have just called and asked someone what 
was inside we would have opened it up 
but lt daniel lang the bomb squads commanding officer said 
there was nothing to snicker about in the handling of the 
incident 
you never know what youre going to find lang said so on 
every call we always assume its a dangerous device 
early wednesday the us customs service at los angeles 
international airport detected what appeared to be sticks of 
dynamite wiring and a clock inside a large heavy suitcase 
destined for an avianca airlines jetliner headed for colombia 
experts then examined the detonated contents of the bomb squad 
canister and found the device to be a nintendo game 
concern about possible bombings of colombian airliners has risen 
because drug traffickers are waging a campaign of bombings and 
assassinations in the south american country in retaliation for 
heightened enforcement efforts to curtail their trade 
all 107 people aboard an avianca jet were killed earlier this 
week when it exploded near the colombian capital bogota initial 
reports later dismissed by investigators placed blame for the 
crash on terrorists 
a spokeswoman for avianca colombias national airline said 
there were tightened security measures in place since mondays 
crash 
there is no confirmation on what caused the downing of that 
jet spokeswoman cecelia battista said from new york security 
has always been tight but it is even tighter now 
the suitcase carrying the suspiciouslooking device was set to 
be loaded on a bogotabound jetliner 
customs officials will reimburse the owners of the exploded 
suitcase police said

the father of one of randy krafts 16 
mutilationmurder victims yelled burn in hell after a judge 
sentenced the serial killer to die in the gas chamber 
the judge also vented outrage wednesday at kraft 44 who 
prosecutors said picked up young male hitchhikers between 1972 and 
1983 gave them drugs and alcohol sexually tortured or mutilated 
them and then strangled them 
he demonstrated an unbelievable aggressive violent tendency 
toward humanity i just cant imagine this violence to satisfy his 
sexual desires said orange county superior court judge donald a 
mccartin 
if anyone ever deserved the death penalty hes got it 
coming mccartin said 
kraft played with his pen cap yawned laughed and chatted with 
his lawyer during the sentencing hearing after being sentenced 
kraft briefly addressed the court 
i have not murdered anyone and i believe a reasonable review 
of the record will show that said kraft a computer consultant 
from long beach 
but juror connie goldfarb said the evidence in the case was 
more horrible than any horror movie because it was real yet at 
times it was so unimaginable that it was hard to believe it was 
real 
darwin hall could not contain his rage at the man convicted of 
murdering his 22yearold son mark howard hall 
burn in hell kraft the elder hall screamed as his sons 
killer was led from the court 
victims relatives who endured six years of trial procedures 
after krafts arrest cried and hugged each other outside the 
courtroom 
they wondered how kraft who prosecutors said tortured one 
victim with a cigarette lighter before castrating and strangling 
him could appear so indifferent in court and maintain his 
innocence 
i saw the evidence i guess we all know the evidence said 
judy nelson whose 18yearold son geoffrey was one of krafts 
victims i dont know how he could sit there and say it other 
than because he wants to make appeals 
it just show you how pathologically a liar a doctor jekyll 
and mr hyde he is 
the judge made a similar observation 
i sat here for a year and i didnt see any remorse feelings 
or regret mccartin said it seemed he was in another world 
during this trial 
mccartin assessed the death penalty for 11 murders and 
consecutive life prison terms for the other five murders saying 
that would ensure krafts imprisonment in case all the death 
sentences were somehow overturned a death sentence is 
automatically appealed to the state supreme court 
kraft also was sentenced to 10 years in prison for three counts 
of sodomy four counts of mayhem and three counts of great bodily 
injury 
a jury convicted kraft on may 12 after a 10month trial and 
recommended the death penalty in august 
california highway patrol officers arrested kraft in 1983 when 
they pulled him over for erratic driving and discovered a strangled 
marine from el toro marine corps air station in his car

the dollar rose against most major currencies in

would move higher and others saying it was only pausing momentarily 
before resuming its downward trend 
gold prices fell sharply but were recovering from their 
overnight lows on a wave of fresh buying 
foreign exchange dealers attributed the dollars firmer tone to 
tighter us interest rates and a lull in the west german marks

its the mark thats moving everything not the dollar 
many frankfurt dealers said the dollar will continue to move 
lower against the mark in coming days but some traders said the

up people have been buying overnight 
news that deutsche bank chief alfred herrhausen was killed in a 
bomb attack early today was spreading through the markets but 
didnt have any impact on the mark or other currencies dealers 
said 
certainly it raises concerns about internal security and 
public order but the world is focused on issues of wider 
implication in germany one trader said 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar fell 063 yen to a closing 14290 yen later in 
london it was quoted at a lower rate of 14265 yen 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late wednesday

a philadelphia school district program that 
gave preference to minority contractors has been struck down by a 
federal judge who said it failed to meet a new more rigid test 
established by the us supreme court 
us district judge charles r weiner on wednesday said that 
generalized assertions of discrimination were not enough to 
justify the program which mandates that a minimum percentage of 
each contract be given to firms controlled by minorities and women 
the supreme court in january struck down a similar setaside 
program in richmond va since then lower courts around the 
country have overturned other such programs 
weiner ruled in a case brought by a whiteowned construction 
firm main line paving co of devon after it lost out on a 
contract for demolition and asbestos removal at an elementary 
school 
school officials wednesday had no comment 
the setaside program was established in 1984 
the district based its plan which requires that each contract 
include at least 15 percent minority and 10 percent female 
participation on a general finding of discrimination in awarding 
of contracts a city council investigation showed that only 05 
percent of district contracts went to minority firms in 1982 and 
1983 
but weiner wrote that such evidence was not sufficient 
it is clear that a majority of the supreme court believes 
that state and local laws and policies employing racial and ethnic 
classifications must be supported by specific evidence of 
discrimination against those aided by the law or policy he said

a leading us scientist says there is 
statistical evidence of a possible link between cancer and exposure 
to electromagnetic fields that radiate from the cables and wires 
that electrify the nation 
the unpublished findings by dr genevieve matanoski an 
epidemiology professor at johns hopkins university run against the 
grain of traditional scientific theory about the possibility of 
health dangers from power distribution lines 
her conclusions fit an emerging pattern of evidence however 
that the possibility of health risks can no longer be ruled out and 
should be studied more closely 
this is consistent with my judgment that well end up 
seeing electric and magnetic fields are cancer promoters of some 
kind said indira nair a physicist at carnegie mellon university 
and coauthor of a recent comprehensive background paper on the 
issue for the federal office of technology assessment 
ms matanoski said in a telephone interview wednesday that her 
findings were preliminary and required further testing but that 
the results changed her view of the still unproven theory about a 
cancer link to power lines 
i thought before that the theory was wrong she said im 
not so sure any more im swayed to think its more likely than 
before 
a major conclusion from her study of 50000 new york state 
telephone workers is that there may be an increased risk of 
leukemia among active workers incidence rates for almost all types 
of cancer are highest among linemen whose exposure to 
electromagnetic fields is the highest in the telephone worker 
group the study found 
ms matanoski also found exceptionally high rates of breast 
cancer among male technicians who work on central office telephone 
switching equipment her study found two cases of breast cancer 
among 9500 central office technicians ordinarily the incidence 
rate for males would be about one in 1 million she said 
ms matanoski said she expected to publish her findings early 
next year 
any electrically charged conductor generates two kinds of 
invisible fields electric and magnetic taken together they are 
called electromagnetic fields some scientific findings have 
suggested these fields can interfere with the functioning of dna 
and rna the controllers of cell reproduction and that they may 
stimulate activity in biochemicals linked to the growth of cancer 
in the century since the united states began using electric 
power scientists generally have dismissed suggestions of any 
danger to human health 
ms matanoski stressed in the interview that she was not yet 
convinced of any health danger but said she no longer was willing 
to rule it out she said further research with a larger number of 
workers was needed before she could be sure 
i have too few cases of cancer to feel strongly about a 
possible link she said 
her study found three cases of leukemia among 4500 linemen an 
incidence rate seven times higher than among other telephone 
workers the overall rate of cancers of all types among linemen was 
nearly twice as high as among other telephone workers 
ms nair said the matanoski results were particularly important 
because of her high standing in the epidemiology community and 
because she had earlier declared herself a skeptic ms nair said 
she had not yet seen the results of the study 
the electric power industry already has shown signs of concern 
about the matanoski findings 
earlier this month officials of the electric power research 
institute an industry group sent letters and briefing papers to 
utility executives noting that ms matanoskis results may 
attract national attention because they suggest an increased risk 
of cancer 
the briefing paper called the findings unexpected noting 
that an earlier matanoski study sponsored by the electric industry 
found no statistically significant link between cancer and 
electromagnetic field exposure in retired telephone workers 
ms matanoski said she had been suspicious of her findings in 
the study of older workers because of the possibility that her 
sample may have excluded younger telephone workers who contracted 
cancer but died before reaching retirement age

the reported crash of a cia plane carrying 
supplies to anticommunist rebels in angola is underscoring 
ussoviet differences on the eve of this weekends superpower 
summit in the mediterranean 
government officials said wednesday the l100 plane went down 
monday night in southeastern angola after a flight from a military 
base in zaire 
the crash occurred just two days after the bush administration 
lodged a protest with the soviet embassy over an abortive attempt 
to deliver soviet weapons to leftist rebels in el salvador 
that shipment was foiled when the cessna aircraft carrying the 
weaponry from nicaragua crashed in eastern el salvador 
the administration reacted indignantly to the perceived soviet 
involvement in support of the salvadoran insurgency but there was 
little us comment wednesday night after the disclosure of the 
crash in angola 
the state department acknowledged that there was a crash in a 
remote area of angola and that among the passengers on board there 
were four americans 
other government officials insisting on anonymity said all the 
americans on board were killed and that some of the accompanying 
angolan rebels survived 
the sources were unable to identify the dead americans but a 
defense department official on tuesday reportedly notified the 
family of james spessard 31 of hagerstown md that he had died 
in a plane crash near zaire 
a family member told the hagerstown morning herald that the 
pentagon official had offered very little information about the 
crash 
spessard is survived by his wife deborah and two small boys 
the resupply mission from zaire to angola cannot be discussed 
publicly by the administration because the united states provides 
assistance on a confidential basis 
one source said the leak of the information originated with 
members of congress opposed to us military involvement in angola 
the disclosure highlighted the continuing differences between 
moscow and washington on some third world conflicts as president 
bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev prepare for their 
summit meeting in the mediterranean 
meanwhile the french newspaper le monde reported wednesday that 
the soviet union has told nicaragua and cuba to stop supplying arms 
to the salvadoran rebels the soviet ambassador to nicaragua gave 
the instructions at a secret meeting tuesday in managua nicaragua 
the newspaper said 
the newspaper said the soviets hoped to gain points with 
washington in the summit by ordering the halt in support to the 
leftist rebels 
angola whose government is run by marxists is one of several 
regional conflicts in which the superpowers have been arming 
opposite sides 
the united states has been providing covert aid to the unita 
rebels in angola since 1986 while the angolan government has been 
backed by soviet weaponry and cuban troops since the country gained 
independence in 1975 
hope for a settlement in angola rose last december when cuba 
agreed to withdraw its 50000 troops from angola over a 27month 
period as part of a broader agreement 
the angolan government and the rebel movement agreed to a 
ceasefire this past june but it broke down in august 
the bush administration has been attempting to promote national 
reconciliation in angola through free elections but thus far there 
has been little basis for serious negotiations 
the country has been ravaged by long years of warfare randall 
robinson a critic of us military involvement said wednesday the 
united states has turned angola into a graveyard 
it is not known exactly how much money the united states 
provides the angolan rebels because the figures are secret but 
congressional sources estimate the amount at about 40 million 
annually 
bush administration officials have said the angolan government 
has shown little interest in engaging in serious peace negotiations 
the united states has been using zaire as a staging area for 
resupplying the angolan rebels but zairean president mobutu sese 
seko suspended his governments cooperation with that effort in 
june when he became a peace mediator 
mobutu during a visit to washington in early october agreed to 
the resumption of the resupply flights under us pressure the 
monday flight is said to have been the first since june

a bomb today killed the 
powerful chairman of west germanys largest bank as he drove to 
work and officials said the leftist red army faction terrorist 
group claimed responsibility 
deutsche bank chief alfred herrhausen 59 died in the explosion 
at about 830 am in the affluent frankfurt suburb of bad homburg 
where he lived 
chancellor helmut kohl his eyes filled with tears and his voice 
breaking condemned the slaying as a cowardly and brutal murder 
and described the influential european financier as a friend and a 
patriot 
herrhausen probably the bestknown figure in west germanys 
business world often advised kohl and frequently accompanied the 
chancellor on his foreign trips 
the chief federal prosecutors office said the red army faction 
which has carried out numerous terrorist attacks in west germany 
claimed responsibility in a letter found at the scene of the 
attack it was the first known red army attack in more than three 
years 
police officials said the blast lifted herrhausens armored bmw 
into the air consuming it in a ball of fire 
the deutsche bank and the chief federal prosecutors office said 
herrhausens driver was alive but suffered serious injuries 
prosecutors spokesman hansjuergen foerster said authorities 
erroneously reported earlier that the driver jakob nix had died 
blaming the error on an incorrect report from police on the scene 
the blast was heard as far away as three miles and shattered 
windows in the vicinity 
foerster said it appeared a remotecontrolled detonating device 
set off explosives placed in the cars path 
other officials speculated that a man on a bicycle may have 
carried out the attack 
police also said they were searching for a man in a blue jogging 
suit and cap who fled on foot after the attack helicopters were 
being used in the search 
witnesses told police a fiat with frankfurt license plates was 
apparently used in the escape later reports said police also were 
looking for an audi 
an interior ministry spokesman siegbert seitz said herrhausen 
was considered a top target of leftist terrorists because of the 
investment policies of his bank 
herrausen led the deutsche bank on an aggressive expansion 
course aimed at making the institution one of the top 10 or 15 
banks in the world 
he urged greater investment in the soviet union and other parts 
of eastern europe most recently he had been speaking out in favor 
of more west german investment in neighboring east germany 
police sealed off the wooded rural road where the car was 
destroyed more than three hours after the blast the bankers body 
remained in the back seat of the shattered and burned car 
herrhausen was the second chairman of a major west german bank 
to be slain in the last 12 years by the red army faction dresdner 
banks chairman juergen ponto was killed by the group in 1977 
herrhausen joined deutsche bank in 1969 became a board member 
two years later he was named bank chairman in 1988 
the deutsche bank chief was probably west germanys most 
influential business figure sitting on numerous boards of 
directors including for the giant daimlerbenz conglomerate 
the killing stunned business and government leaders throughout 
europe 
in bonn free democratic member of parliament wolfgang weng 
interrupted a budget debate to denounce the horrible news of 
herrhausens death 
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble broke into tears as he told 
parliament about herrhausens death 
in frankfurt the franticpaced stock exchange came to a 
minutelong halt 
herrhausen is survived by a wife and two daughters 
the last known red army attack occurred in october 1986 when 
diplomat gerold von braunmuehl was shot and killed on a street in 
bonn

trying to force out of lebanon 
military sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
hundreds of syrian army trucks hauled ammunition to forward 
positions facing aouns troops in south beirut and the eastern and

waters in preparation for a possible evacuation if french nationals 
were endangered it sailed from the southern port of toulon early 
today

under the new commander adm emile lahoud would take part in any 
effort to dislodge aoun from his headquarters at the 
shellshattered presidential palace in baabda east of beirut 
aoun will not quit easily the nationalist army would take 
part in the battle to evict him said jumblatt who is minister

has a predominantly christian force of 20000 soldiers 
hrawi a maronite catholic like aoun accused the rebellious

determine whether aouns problem will be dealt with politically or 
militarily

dispatched by hrawi to the vatican and paris early in the week to 
discuss ways of solving aouns problem the official said

cover under pine trees to maintain a human shield around the 
presidential palace a large crowd was still there today 
the army usually defends the people now the people are 
defending the army and its general the aoun spokesman said

aoun was using the christian youths as human sandbags to hide 
behind 
shiite moslem militia chieftain nabih berri in a statement 
called on our brethren in the christian enclave to support the 
survival of lebanon not the survival of a person aoun 
berri who doubles as minister of electrical and hydraulic 
resources said hrawis government was one of national unity a 
government of peace we prefer to solve this problem peacefully 
but we cannot wait for ever 
parliament elected hrawi president on saturday to replace his 
assassinated predecessor rene mouawad both pledged to implement 
the provisions of a lebanon peace agreement hammered out by 
lebanons parliament in saudi arabia 
aoun who fought the syrians for six months earlier this year 
rejected the accord because it did not include a fixed timetable 
for a syrian troop withdrawal 
the syrians have 40000 troops controlling 70 percent of 
lebanese territory under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate

authorities have cleared the way for criminal 
charges to be filed against ousted leader erich honecker and other 
disgraced officials of the past communist party leadership east 
german officials announced today 
a security cordon also was erected around the lavish compound 
where honecker and other party figures suspected of wrongdoing live 
to prevent them from taking state property the official adn news 
agency reported 
hartmut boecker head of the local governing council for the 
neubrandenburg area where the party officials live said he ordered 
the area sealed off and stripped the former leaders of their 
immunity from criminal charges 
boecker said the declaration clears the way for criminal 
proceedings against honecker former premier willi stoph and others 
there was no immediate indication of what charges might be filed 
or when 
the actions coincide with other efforts by party chief egon 
krenz to distance his new reformminded leadership from the 
reported abuses of power committed by honecker and his colleagues 
on wednesday east german newspapers disclosed that stoph had 
taken valuables from his opulent estate after communist party 
officials began investigating allegations of wrongdoing by former 
party figures the reports said stoph had turned a park into a 
private estate that included several homes and an indoor swimming 
pool 
krenz and communist premier hans modrow signed a petition 
circulated by activists who are calling for east germany to remain 
socialist 
keeping a socialist framework could help the communists maintain 
the power they have wielded without contest for 40 years 
krenz 52 who has been in office only six weeks faces a strong 
challenge from reform activists he will meet with wednesday as 
well as from the communist party hierarchy that will attend a 
special congress on dec 1517 
his ability to remain party leader will depend largely on his 
success in appeasing the opposition forces at wednesdays talks 
the talks are the latest political development in east germany 
where the exodus of thousands of people and massive antigovernment 
demonstrations led to the ouster of honecker on oct 18 and the 
opening of the berlin wall on nov 9 
the party has agreed that krenz and modrow will debate the 
course of reform with delegates from allied political parties and 
from opposition groups 
both sides agreed to let church officials moderate the 
discussions at a lutheran church facility in east berlin the 
official adn news agency reported wednesday 
a main issue will be a proposal to strike the communists 
guaranteed monopoly on power from the state constitution church 
sources said 
spokeswoman angelika barbe of the east german social democrats 
said her recently formed party planned to call for measures to free 
political prisoners and remove barriers remaining for the return of 
those who fled the past regime 
nearly 300000 east germans have moved to west germany this 
year discouraged about prospects for speedy or thorough reform at 
home 
opposition groups have pushed for the reform talks to cover 
economic issues a main concern is stopping further damage to the 
weak east german mark caused by blackmarket sales spurred by 
travel to the west 
the petition signed by krenz and modrow was initiated by writer 
stefan heym and other east german intellectuals concerned about the 
countrys future they want a national referendum on whether the 
country should remain socialist 
the communist leadership as well as many members of the 
proreform groups oppose west german efforts to work toward 
reunification of the two germanys 
west german chancellor helmut kohl on tuesday laid out a 
10point plan for building a confederation between the two states 
aiming at reunification 
the bonn government launched a diplomatic offensive to promote 
the idea kohl telephoned president bush and foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher flew to britain and france to inform the 
allies of the plan 
krenz has sought to use east german public sentiment against 
reunification as a rallying call to win popular support for his 
beleaguered communist party 
we have the historic duty to preserve this country with its 
antifascist ideals and traditions as a socialist alternative 
within german development he told backers of the appeal who 
want a nationwide vote of confidence in socialism 
echoing the words of the petition krenz promised that east 
germany will preserve peace and social justice individual 
freedom freedom of travel for all and the preservation of the 
environment 
the communists bowing to pressure from growing opposition 
forces have promised free elections no date has been set

the district attorneys office 
considered bringing charges against the third mate of the exxon 
valdez in addition to the captain but alaskas attorney general 
vetoed the idea a prosecutor says 
anchorage assistant district attorney brent cole said he favored 
indicting gregory cousins who was in control of the tanker when it 
struck a reef march 24 and began spilling nearly 11 million gallons 
of oil into prince william sound 
cole testified wednesday at a pretrial hearing for fired skipper 
joseph hazelwood that he was told the attorney general said no 
to a cousins indictment 
the reasons we were told were that they felt mr cousins could 
help them out in their civil case and they didnt want to make mr 
cousins an enemy in their civil case cole said 
his testimony came on the third day of the hearing for 
hazelwood who has been charged in the spill cole who will be the 
prosecutor at hazelwoods trial jan 22 was among a string of 
witnesses the state has presented to show why the captain should be 
tried 
hazelwood 43 a veteran mariner from huntington ny was not 
on the bridge at the time of the grounding he left the tanker 
under the supervision of cousins 
hazelwood faces felony charges of criminal mischief plus 
misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment operating a vessel 
while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil 
hazelwoods lawyers say charges should be dismissed because he 
reported the tanker accident and thereby qualified for immunity 
under state law 
virtually every piece of evidence against hazelwood can be 
traced to his prompt report and may not be used against him the 
defense argued 
the state contends that discovery of the spill was inevitable 
and that independent sources provided information for hazelwoods 
prosecution

eight people aboard a twinengine 
commuter plane that vanished off rhode island have been given up 
for dead 
the coast guard called off the search by air and sea wednesday 
night for the new england airlines plane that disappeared tuesday 
during a 17mile flight from block island to the mainland 
searchers had found the bodies of a passengers two dogs that 
had been on board as well as a cabin panel life jackets seat 
cushions a headset and other debris believed to be from the plane 
but saw no other sign of the aircraft itself or those aboard 
the results of the search indicated there were probably no 
survivors from the crash petty officer david jersey said 
in westerly national transportation safety board spokesman ted 
lopatkiewicz said today that without wreckage the cause of the 
crash is unlikely to be determined 
i think all were going to be able to do today is go through 
the aircraft records and the pilot records and unless something 
comes up out of the ordinary there wont be much he said 
the ntsb had no authority to order a search for the wreckage 
and any attempts to find it would be up to the airlines insurance 
company lopatkiewicz said 
the coast guard began its search shortly after the british 
norman islander plane built in 1969 was reported missing 
coast guard officials had expressed hope early wednesday of 
finding survivors but veteran islanders said the seas of 5 to 6 
feet and water temperature of about 45 degrees made survival 
unlikely 
the debris was found mainly in an area where the water averages 
100 feet deep 
thomas grady new england airlines attorney said the federal 
aviation administration would also investigate 
the plane had the most thorough inspection it gets in the 
preceding 30 days he said

the government said today it will 
begin dismantling its fortifications along the border with austria 
and lawmakers recommended abolishing some of the toughest laws used 
to crack down on dissent 
government spokesman marcel jansen said the interior ministry 
was asked today to start immediate removal of technical 
equipment along parts of the czechoslovakaustrian border such 
equipment includes concrete pylons linked with barbed wire and some 
electronic wire to detect trespassers 
the moves came one day after parliament took the historic step 
of removing the guaranteed leading role of the communist party from 
the constitution 
jansen refused to specify when and exactly where work on the 
border would start saying it was likely to begin near the slovak 
capital of bratislava a onehour drive east of vienna 
in may hungary started dismantling fortifications along its 
border with neutral austria its only point of contact with a 
western country 
czechoslovakia also has a long border with west germany but 
jansen made no mention of action along that border 
the order to dismantle part of czechoslovakias portion of the 
iron curtain reflected the new foreign policy that communist 
premier ladislav adamec has promised to follow 
adamec is due to name a new coalition government by sunday that 
would include noncommunists and possibly members of the civic 
forum opposition group which headed up 11 days of antigovernment 
protests and a hugely successful general strike monday 
he continued consultations today after announcing that he could 
accept opposition suggestions on whom to include 
civic forum spokesman jiri dienstbier said wednesday night that 
the opposition wanted a civilian communist in charge of the defense 
ministry and a noncommunist overseeing police forces at the 
interior ministry 
dienstbier reiterated past statements that civic forum has no 
cabinet aspirations but he did not specifically exclude 
participation in the government by some of the experts who have 
worked with the opposition 
seeking to paint himself as a figure of national consensus in 
the current crisis adamec in a television speech wednesday made a 
number of points aimed at winning him the sympathy of 
czechoslovakias 155 million citizens 
his call for a reassessment of the 1968 warsaw pact invasion 
that crushed the 1968 prague spring reforms was accompanied by 
a pledge to negotiate the withdrawal of the 80000 soviet troops 
stationed in czechoslovakia 
those troops were seen as the legitimizing force of the 
czechoslovak leaders installed by moscow after the invasion 
those leaders ousted party chief milos jakes and other top 
communists now have lost power 
the state news agency ctk today said unidentified parliamentary 
deputies suggested abolition of toughened laws on public order 
which were passed in march and used to impose stiff fines or jail 
terms on hundreds of people arrested during a series of 
antigovernment demonstrations in january 
the deputies said this amendment and a series of other new 
legal measures should be submitted for consideration in parliament 
dec 1213 
the deputies also proposed shortening the period of pretrial 
custody to a twomonth maximum political prisoners have sometimes 
waited more than a year to go to court 
the deputies also proposed removing the criminal offense of 
abusing a religious function from the statute books 
this law which imposed maximum imprisonment of three years was 
frequently used against priests deemed to have overstepped the 
strict state controls on churches in czechoslovakia 
priests must have a state licence to practice in czechoslovakia 
and many have had to go underground after being barred from office 
by the authorities 
the deputies also want an unspecified change in the criminal 
code article on emigration ctk said it seemed likely they would 
seek to drop criminal charges against those who left the country 
illegally 
the deputies also recommended that the independence of courts be 
anchored in a new draft constitution to be published and passed 
soon 
they also seek a new law meting out punishment to those who 
damage the environment 
thirty percent of czechoslovakias forests have been destroyed 
by acid rain and other pollution and both air and water are 
heavily polluted in prague and several other cities 
tighter control of pollution by large state enterprises has been 
a key demand of opposition groups for several years 
also today six political prisoners were reported released and 
former charter 77 spokesman stanislav devaty who went underground 
several weeks ago and another rights activist were amnestied by 
president gustav husak 
there were no other details immediately available

the 1989 hurricane season marked by the costliest 
storm in us history officially ended today with yet another 
tropical storm forming in the caribbean 
at 8 am est tropical storm karen with 50 mph winds was 
about 125 miles southsouthwest of havana and was not expected to 
strengthen said the national hurricane center in suburban coral 
gables it was drifttng toward cuba at about 5 mph 
depressions become named storms when their sustained winds reach 
39 mph hurricanes have winds of at least 74 mph karen is the 11th 
named storm of the season which began june 1 
the sixmonth season was far less deadly than 1988s in which 
550 people died in storms 
this years storms killed 84 people including 56 in the united 
states said meteorologist mark zimmer hurricane hugo was blamed 
for 49 deaths including 21 in this country it slammed into south 
carolina on sept 21 
ive seen greater damage in smaller areas said bob sheets 
director of the hurricane center but ive never seen it on such 
a large scale where you go mile after mile with such massive 
damage 
overall damage from hugo totaled about 10 billion in the 
united states it caused a record storm damage of about 7 billion 
most of the us damage was around charleston 
the us virgin islands are racing to recover from hugo in time 
for the tourist season 
we are still in a sense reeling from the effects of hugo but 
that didnt dampen our spirit said alexander a ferrelly 
governor of the us virgin islands he said wednesday that st 
thomas and st john are ready for winter tourists and st croix 
would be ready by early 1990 
it was the most expensive disaster for the american red cross 
since the organization began 110 years ago latest figures show the 
agency has spent about 38 million in the caribbean and the 
carolinas said michael caudill a spokesman in washington 
the hurricane season which began june 1 had four tropical 
storms counting karen and seven hurricanes the storms also were 
stronger than usual said sheets 
last year there were seven tropical storms and five hurricanes 
the atlantic season usually has 10 named storms normally only 
five or six whip up the 74mph sustained winds to become a 
hurricane 
hugo the fifth major atlantic hurricane in the last decade to 
reach us shores may have marked the end of a 30year period of 
fewer weaker hurricanes sheets said 
there have been fewer of the stronger hurricanes making 
landfall since the 1960s sheets said now maybe were starting 
to return to more normal activity like we had in the 50s and 
60s 
during the 1950s eight major hurricanes hit the united states 
while seven struck the following decade 
after hugo the most damaging tropical system this year was 
tropical storm allison it dumped large amounts of rain and caused 
11 deaths and 500 million damage in texas and louisiana

nadia comaneci the world renowned 
gymnast who made olympic history when she was 14 years old has 
dropped from sight after fleeing across the romanian border into 
hungary 
ms comanecis former coach bela karolyi said today she was 
probably in the us embassy in switzerland obtaining travel 
papers but an embassy spokesman denied it 
karolyi became a us citizen last spring and is currently in 
west germany with an american womens gymnastics team 
ms comaneci told hungarian border officials she had been banned 
by romanian leader nicolae ceausescu from traveling abroad and was 
fleeing her native land for the sake of freedom official media 
reported 
ms comaneci crossed into hungary by car before dawn tuesday at 
the border town of kiszombor with six other romanians who were not 
identified the mti news agency said 
her defection was a surprise particularly because the 
28yearold athleteturnedtrainer reportedly had close ties with 
the ceausescu family and at one time was said to have been 
romantically involved with the romanian presidents son nicu 
ms comaneci dropped from sight wednesday when she and her 
companions left the hotel in the nearby town of szeged where they 
had been lodged by police according to hungarian press reports 
ms comaneci had been given a threeday temporary residence 
permit 
a spokesman at the hungarian olympic committee told the 
associated press today the gymnast had not contacted them and they 
knew nothing of her whereabouts 
because of her achievements ms comaneci was named a hero of 
socialist labor by ceausescu the hardline leader who declared 
at last weeks romanian communist party congress that he would not 
yield to the forces of reform sweeping the rest of the east bloc 
at age 14 ms comaneci dazzled the sports world at the 1976 
montreal olympic games with the firstever scores of perfect 10s in 
olympic gymnastics she won three gold medals in the uneven bars 
balance beam and overall competitions 
the achievements of the 4foot11 teenager brought her elite 
status in her homeland and tremendous popularity in the united 
states 
during a competitive career that lasted until 1984 ms comaneci 
won a total of 21 gold medals in olympic and other international 
contests 
she reportedly had been living in an eightroom villa and had a 
western car both extremely rare for private citizens in a country 
that has endured chronic shortages of consumer goods for most of 
this decade 
in the past two years tens of thousands of romanians have 
sought refuge in hungary because of worsening economic conditions 
and political intransigence at home 
just like me she was chased out of the country by the 
romanian authorities said karolyi who defected to the united 
states in 1981

a police officer whose slaying of a black suspect 
set off three days of rioting took the stand at his manslaughter 
trial today and said he fired because the man was bearing down on 
him with his motorcycle 
i turned my body to face the motorcycle he just came straight 
at me with a tremendous noise said officer william lozano he 
was just aiming at me i was just able to turn my body draw my gun 
and shoot 
the fiveyear veteran of the miami police department said he 
thought he was going to die and was briefly in shock 
after recovering he said he found no vital signs when he 
checked on the motorcyclist he saw that the cyclists passenger 
was injured and radioed a dispatcher to say he had fired his weapon 
and a fatality was involved 
the prosecution charges lozano acted with gross negligence when 
he shot and killed the motorcyclist clement lloyd 23 on jan 16 
sparking three days of rioting in the communitys black 
neighborhoods the passenger alan blanchard died the next day 
lozano is charged with manslaughter in their deaths 
lozano 31 testified that he was hyper and that the 
dispatcher did not understand his first transmission he said he 
took a deep breath and repeated it 
within moments an angry crowd gathered and lozano said he and 
others were getting hit right and left with rocks and bottles 
lozanos account came after a halfhour of questioning about his 
personal history and his police service giving the jury an 
impression of a welltrained officer with a list of commendations 
under cross examination assistant state attorney john hogan 
asked lozano to read aloud from a police review document that 
listed lozano as average in most categories including 
decisionmaking and reliability 
hogan also had lozano recount an incident in which a jaialai 
player accused lozano of physical abuse during a strike 
lozano was just beginning to review the events leading up to the 
shooting when the trial was recessed for 45 minutes after an 
alternate juror complained of abdominal pain and nausea 
addressing his answers with a slight spanish accent directly to 
the jury the colombianborn lozano wore a dark blue suit dress 
shirt and red tie for his appearance the testimony was broadcast 
live on miami television and radio 
prosecution witnesses contended that the motorcyclist was in the 
opposite lane from lozano when the officer coolly took aim at the 
driver tracked him with his gun and fired the fatal shot as the 
bike was about to pass him 
the defense however insists that the motorcyclist attempting 
to outrun a pursuing squad car had crossed into the traffic lane 
where lozano was standing and the officer shot in selfdefense to 
avoid being run over 
one defense witness 18yearold dedrick belle balked at giving 
depositions and had fled investigators attempting to talk to him 
according to court testimony 
belle who lives in the overtown neighborhood where the shooting 
and subsequent rioting occurred told the court wednesday he feared 
for his life if he was made to testify for the defense 
it will result in violence because im black and he shot a 
black guy belle told dade circuit judge joseph farina 
over the objections of media attorneys the judge banned any 
filming of belle during his brief testimony 
his testimony was aimed at compromising star prosecution witness 
eddie johnson who was talking with lozano just before the 
shooting johnson wound up with the cartridge casing from the fatal 
bullet after the shooting but denied on the stand that he had 
waved it about or shown it to neighbors before turning it over to 
police 
belle however said johnson showed the shell to everyone and 
even let him hold it 
other defense witnesses wednesday included a former university 
of miami professor geoffrey alpert who prepared a study of miami 
police weapon discharges between jan 1 1980 and dec 31 1986 
alpert who now teaches at the university of south carolina 
said 13 percent of the 150 shootings he examined were instances in 
which an officer was firing while being attacked by a vehicle 
the prosecution has contended that lozano disregarded police 
policy when he failed to step out of the roadway and then fired at 
a moving vehicle 
when the case opened oct 23 the defense attempted 
unsuccessfully to move the trial arguing that miami juries would 
be too worried about renewed racial violence to find lozano 
innocent 
twice before in this decade innocent verdicts favoring 
policemen accused of killing blacks have led to rioting and the 
miami and metrodade police forces have been on alert because of 
lozanos trial

local officials thursday disputed the 
governments plan to close pisas famed leaning tower for 
restoration work saying it is in no immediate danger 
the closure is unjustified because the situation of the tower 
has not worsened recently and because conservation work can be 
initiated without banning tourists said giuseppe toniolo who 
heads opera primaziale the private institution managing and 
restoring the tower 
an estimated 800000 visitors a year climb the 294 marble steps 
of the 162foot monument bringing in revenue of about 714 
million 
the government commission for public works suggested tuesday the 
leaning tower be closed immediately a final decision by the 
government is expected soon although the city can appeal it to 
parliament 
government experts are worried because its tilt has been 
increasing by an average 0047 inches a year since measurements 
began in 1918 
the tower was completed in 1360 and experts believe it began 
leaning immediately because it was built on sinking soil 
the government has allotted 71 million for the conservation of 
the tower but experts have been stumped on how to save it 
gero geri a professor of topography in pisa has said it will 
take at least 100 years before the tower reached the point of 
toppling

grand forks officials were pleased as 
the dickens about winning a bid for railbased mx nuclear 
missiles that would bring jobs and prestige 
thats a lot of insurance policies cars and turtlenecks 
said bob gustafson president of the grand forks chamber of 
commerce after learning wednesday that the grand forks air force 
base was among six new sites chosen to get the missiles all of 
which are currently kept at a base in wyoming 
but in minot 200 miles to the west there was disappointment 
both cities lobbied hard for the missiles through 
letterwriting campaigns and visits to washington 
the 50 mx missiles are to be removed from underground silos in 
wyoming and placed on 25 trains each with two mx missiles aboard 
the trains will be in wyoming and on bases in grand forks and five 
other areas around the country the missiles will be moved onto 
civilian railroad tracks in time of crisis 
the loss of the railbased system was hard on minot because it 
came just about a year after the transfer of 18 fighter jets to a 
national guard base in massachusetts 
you win some and you lose some said bruce christianson 
chairman of the minot chamber of commerces military affairs 
committee 
the grand forks base and the minot air force base maintain 
nuclear missiles and strategic bombers the minot base opened in 
1959 and the grand forks base in 1960 the minot base has about 
14000 military personnel and their families the grand forks base 
13000 
both bases contribute more than 200 million to the economies of 
their communities 
were disappointed of course said minot mayor george 
christensen we dont know what they have down the line but wed 
accept anything else 
brig gen patrick caruana commander of the grand forks base 
said construction of the mx system could begin in 1992 and the 
system could become operational two years later 
north dakota houses about 300 minuteman missiles each capable 
of carrying three warheads in underground silos near minot and 
grand forks the mx missiles can carry up to 10 warheads 
caruana said the grand forks garrison will cost 80 million to 
100 million and employ as many as 450 people 
but grand forks mayor mike polovitz along with the states 
congressional delegation cautioned that the project might not be 
built at all because of changes taking place in the soviet union 
and its eastern european allies 
i still have some questions whether it will be funded because 
of what is happening in europe now polovitz said im pleased 
that we as acommunity got together and worked for this im also 
pleased with whats happening in eastern europe so were kind of 
caught in between 
if they go ahead with the rail garrison and fund it im 
pleased as the dickens to have it here in grand forks 
peace activists meanwhile were unhappy with the entire idea of 
the mx missiles 
an mx missile by its very nature is a firststrike weapon 
said al hermodson of the crookston peace workers in crookston 
minn near grand forks i see this either as a continuation of 
firststrike capability or as a welfare program for weapons 
manufacturers i think its a little of both

the man struggling to renew lenins revolution 
more than 70 years after it declared religion the opiate of the 
people was himself baptized in his peasant village into the 
ancient rites of russian orthodoxy 
and if 58 years later mikhail s gorbachev does not believe in 
god his early years apparently engendered a healthy respect for 
those who do including his mother 
the gorbachev years have seen a dramatic shift in official 
tolerance of religion in a country whose people ostensibly have 
been turned into spiritual materialists by decades of communist 
dogma gorbachev has told religious leaders that they too have a 
place in the communistled healing of the nations psyche 
but as government pressure eases the future of a nascent 
religious revival is beginning to depend more on the willingness of 
church leaders to throw off their own strictures and traditional 
subservience 
since gorbachev became soviet leader in march 1985 
the number of baptisms and reopenings of churches in the 
christian heartland have increased dramatically important 
religious centers like the pechorsky monastery of kiev have been 
given back jews also enjoy greater religious freedom and a revival 
of islam in central asia is increasing the number of seminary 
students and mosques 
scores of religious dissidents of all faiths have been freed 
from jails and prison camp 
the patriarch of the russian orthodox church has met with the 
soviet leader for the first time in more than 40 years clergy 
celebrated the 400th anniversary of the moscow patriarchate on oct 
13 with the first service in more than 70 years in the kremlins 
uspensky cathedral where russian czars once were crowned 
gorbachev has met with a top representative of the vatican 
and will meet with pope john paul ii on friday members of the 
banned ukrainian catholic church in the western ukraine believe the 
vatican meeting will lead to legalization of their church after 43 
years underground 
asked in july whether he had been baptized after his birth in 
1931 in the southern russian village of privolnoye gorbachev 
replied yes i was i think its quite normal isnt it 
reporters who have visited the area say his mother maria still 
regularly attends russian orthodox services 
interviewed by finnish tv in conjunction with gorbachevs visit 
to helsinki in october archbishop anatoly of stavropol said the 
official attitude toward religion in that region which includes 
privolnoye eased when gorbachev was the local communist party 
leader 
practically speaking beginning in 1975 in stavropol churches 
and groups of believers have been able to exercise all their 
rights he said weve had perestroika since 1975 gorbachev 
was regional party chief from 1970 to 1978 
when he met with patriarch pimen of the russian orthodox church 
prior to the celebration of the churchs millenium in 1988 
gorbachev made clear that religious believers have both a stake and 
a place in his reform program 
the millenium he said should be marked by the consolidation 
of our countrys believers all working people for the sake of our 
common great cause of perestroika of the renewal of socialism the 
complete unfolding of its humanistic ethical potential 
soviet officials have been reporting for more than two years 
that a new law on religion is being prepared and they say it is 
likely to be presented to the soviet legislature soon 
they promise the law will ease strict stalinera prohibitions on 
group religious instruction and charitable work by churches and 
make it easier for them to receive official recognition 
the law has not yet been changed but some russian orthodox 
churches have begun to act according to the weekly moscow news 
moscow parishes are contributing heavily to support childrens 
homes in the capital 
veniamin yefremov an inspector for the government council of 
religious affairs that has been charged with overseeing believers 
encouraged more charitable work 
apparently some people are waiting for some instructions from 
above there is only one instruction in such work the dictates of 
the heart he said 
muscovites say baptism has become increasingly popular even 
fashionable in some circles but it does not mean that the 
baptized know much about the faith they have embraced or even want 
to know 
two scholars writing in the communist theoretical journal 
kommunist in 1987 said people had begun flocking to churches to 
find some beauty in the religious chanting and church icons that 
was missing in their increasingly cheerless lives in the soviet 
system 
religious critics wonder whether russian orthodox church 
officials used to taking what the government is willing to give 
can take advantage of the freer atmosphere 
during recent harsh years the russian orthodox church 
concentrated much activity on disarmament issues which at the time 
coincided with soviet government propaganda efforts 
ukrainian catholics are demanding the return from the russian 
orthodox church of buildings and property taken over when their 
religion was forced underground in 1946 
if we could count on sincerity and christian love from the 
russian church there wouldnt be a problem said father yaroslav 
chukhny who led lvovs cathedral of the transfiguration from the 
russian orthodox church to the ukrainian catholic church on oct 29 
the essence of religion is not building churches or holding 
beautiful services but the morals of man he said

photos of the us stealth fighter said to show 
the topsecret warplane in unprecedented detail have been 
published in a weekly defense magazine 
janes defense weekly said the pictures show that the view of 
the plane given by the us air force a year ago was carefully 
selected to conceal the f117s true shape and made the aircraft 
appear much shorter and wider than it is 
the article accompanying the two pictures was written by bill 
sweetman a leading civilian authority on the stealth program to 
build bombers and fighters that can elude radar detection 
one picture appeared to show the deltawinged lockheed f117a 
flying horizontally while the other showed it in a vertical 
position in each picture its landing gear was down and it was 
accompanied by a t38 chase plane 
sweetman wrote the aircraft is coated in radarabsorbent 
material and faceted to discourage the scattering of radar 
energy toward the transmitter location 
the fighter is a different aircraft from the stealth bomber 
recently unveiled for tv cameras 
sweetman wrote that the fighters overall length is 666 feet 
wingspan is 416 feet and maximum takeoff weight is about 45100 
pounds 
the report said two squadrons of f117s are operational with the 
4450th tactical group at tonopah nev 
it said the last of 59 f117s including five test aircraft 
were likely to be delivered next year it said one test aircraft 
and two production planes have been lost in accidents since the jet 
made its first flight in october 1981

a state legislative committee approved and sent to 
the house for debate today 11 billion in tax increases to close 
the budget deficit that signaled the end of the massachusetts 
miracle 
the package of higher taxes on capital gains sales and gasoline 
was approved on a voice vote wednesday by the house ways and means 
committee it immediately drew fire from both legislators and the 
public 
this bill imposes the most regressive kind of a tax hitting 
hardest those in massachusetts who can least afford it said 
edward e mulligan head of massachusetts electric co 
the house was scheduled to begin debate on the package today 
and house leaders said they hoped to send it to the senate by the 
end of the week 
the proposal is the legislatures latest move to deal with the 
deficit which a ways and means committee staffer said had swelled 
to 825 million only a year ago the economic boom dubbed the 
massachusetts miracle nearly carried gov michael dukakis to the 
white house 
as the committee sent the proposal to the house the senate held 
hearings on a 350 million houseapproved package of spending cuts 
legislative leaders envision enacting the cuts in conjuction with 
the tax package which has been embraced by the governor 
under the tax package the sales tax would rise from five cents 
to seven cents on the dollar the gas tax would go from 11 cents to 
21 cents per gallon and capital gains would be increased from 5 
percent to 75 percent 
the package would raise nearly 11 billion in additional 
revenue by the next fiscal year still more revenue would be raised 
by shifting 30 million more in cigarette taxes into the general 
fund and by collecting 24 million in unclaimed returnablebottle 
deposits 
the package was developed by the house leadership and speaker 
george keverian backed it up by telling several committee chairmen 
they should resign if they they could not support it one committee 
chairman quit on tuesday 
democratic rep john mcdonough spoke up for new taxes before the 
ways and means vote saying it was time the legislature and the 
administration corrected spending errors that were based on overly 
ambitious revenue estimates 
at what point do we face up to the fact that we were all wrong 
about the deficit he asked 
rep steven pierce the republican minority leader said the 
democratic leaderships deficit estimates are designed to promote 
taxes he estimated the deficit is less than 500 million and 
accused the democratic leadership of twisting arms and getting 
that tax bill through here as quickly as possible 
john gould head of associated industries of massachusetts said 
the increase in the capital gains tax would stifle economic growth 
we are going to hurt our image and make ourselves less 
attractive to investors from outside the state he said

juvenile court judge jan 10 
less than 10 had been put into the machine at

said police chief harry montgomery 
it appeared the students initially got faculty members to copy 
the bills for them by telling the teachers they wanted to use the 
copies in a monopoly game montgomery said 
the students could also be charged with counterfeiting but 
agent jess mcgaha of the us secret service office in nashville 
said the service is not pressing charges although using a copy 
machine to duplicate money is considered counterfeiting 
there were no hardened criminals involved here he said

the belknap is anchored a few hundred yards behind the soviet 
missile cruiser slava where gorbachev will be host on saturday for 
talks with bush in richly paneled wardrooms appointed with plush 
furniture and oriental rugs 
by comparison the site of saturdays state dinner in the 
belknap wardroom is spartan the walls are white and wainscotted 
with artificial paneling a soviet and american flag are displayed 
below one porthole two tables one seating 20 and the other 10 
are crowded into the room along with a large milk cooler that can 
be hidden with a navy blue curtain 
sigler who was to visit the slava later thursday said he had 
heard the soviet warship had more creature comforts 
i heard they have a sauna for example he said 
i think we are comfortable he added i dont feel at a 
disadvantage i just think there is perhaps a different emphasis 
here than there 
there are other more obvious differences between the two ships 
the slava is 17 years younger than the 25yearold belknap 
slightly longer and its decks are bristling with arms there are 16 
surfacetosurface missile tubes on the soviet cruiser compared to 
just four on the american ship 
its a beautiful ship sigler said of the slava of course 
it is much newer than my ship and the soviets tend to have most of 
their weapons topside where we have most of ours below decks the 
result is that she looks heavily armed i think our capabilities 
are very similar in a lot of ways but she certainly looks 
imposing 
bushs quarters aboard the belknap are small and cramped the 
bluecarpeted cabin has just about 20 square feet of floor space a 
double bed a gold recliner and a toshiba color television with 
fisher vhs and sony beta videotape players 
from his porthole on the starboard side the president will have 
a view of the st luciano watchtower a 16th century castle built 
by the knights of malta on a jagged cliff that juts into marsaxlokk 
bay at the point closest to the american and soviet warships 
the president also will use the admirals office which is 
dominated by a large wooden desk on which sits a christmas card 
addressed to bush from emily shewchuk the 7yearold daughter of 
one of the belknaps officers gorbachev will be given a holding 
room in the chief of staffs office 
bushs cabin and office are one flight up a steep metal ladder 
from the main deck and just steps away from the admirals mess 
where the two leaders will meet with just two interpreters and two 
people to take notes 
bush and gorbachev will deliver their joint statement at the end 
of the summit sunday on the belknaps forecastle standing beneath 
the launchers for the cruisers surfacetoair missiles 
earlier sunday bush will attend a nondenominational protestant 
church service at the same site 
i am very nervous very nervous said lt david schwabauer 
a presbyterian minister who is the ships chaplain the thought 
of preaching to the president of the united states is terrifying

a fire that damaged the home of a 
legislator who had tried to keep a state university from putting on 
a play about aids and homosexuality was declared accidental today 
fireplace embers dumped in the back yard wednesday night by one 
of jean dixons children ignited leaves and scrap wood and spread 
to the state representatives home chief fire marshal dale bittle 
said 
arson investigators had been called in to determine whether the 
fire was set like a blaze on nov 15 that destroyed the home of a 
student who had led a campaign in support of the play larry 
kramers the normal heart 
fire chief phil johnston estimated damage dixons home at 5000 
to 10000 mostly involving the attic and exterior there were no 
injuries 
dixon and her husband were away at the time but five dixon 
children ranging from 7 to 20 years old were at home with an adult 
friend the fire chief said a neighbor discovered the fire about 
1240 am and alerted those inside who included three sleeping 
children 
dixon a republican was among the most vocal opponents of a 
presentation of the normal heart at southwest missouri state 
university on nov 1520 she objected to use of a public facility 
for a play that presents homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle 
kramer and his supporters accused her of censorship and said the 
play which quickly sold out amid the controversy helped educate 
students about aids 
the night the play opened someone apparently set a fire at the 
home of brad evans 22 after forcing open a back door 
investigators said evans was leading a candlelight ceremony in 
support of the play when the fire occurred

reduced levels of an important protein 
molecule may play a role in the collapse of the immune system in 
patients infected with the aids virus according to a study at the 
national institutes of health 
dr ronald g crystal a researcher at the national heart lung 
and blood institute one of the nih agencies said a deficit of 
glutathione was found in a group patients infected with the aids 
virus and he suggests that this may be one clue about why the 
immune dysfunction occurs in victims of the disease 
in a study to be published friday in the british medical journal 
lancet crystal and seven other researchers report that they 
measured the levels of glutathione in the blood and lung fluids of 
14 patients infected with the aids virus and compared the results 
with studies of 19 patients not infected with aids 
crystal said that patients who were seropositive or 
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus hiv that causes 
aids had glutathione levels reduced by onethird to onehalf of 
what is normal 
what we found is that the glutachione level in seropositive 
people was low suggesting a systemic deficiency of glutathione 
said the researcher 
the patients in the study infected with hiv had normal levels of 
lymphocytes a diseasefighting white blood cell attacked by the 
aids virus and their disease had not progressed to fullblown aids 
crystal said glutathione is a common protein molecule whose 
precise function in the body is not known but earlier research has 
proven that it is important in the bodys shield against infection 
it seems to play an important role in allowing the immune 
system to function normally said crystal nobody knows why or 
how but the immune system does better when glutathione is 
around theres a lot of evidence of that 
a deficiency of glutathione he said may be a clue in a medical 
mystery that has puzzled aids researchers for years 
crystal said that early in the course of an aids virus 
infection there clearly is immune dysfunction but yet there 
typically are very very few cells that are actually infected with 
hiv how the disease could compromise the immune system with so few 
soldiers attacking the bodys cells has been one of the 
unanswered questions about aids he said 
there has got to be ways that the hiv infection amplifies 
itself in terms of its effect on the body said crystal this 
the glutathione deficiency may be one clue about why the immune 
dysfunction occurs 
the scientist emphasized that finding the exact role that 
reduced glutathione plays in the course of an aids virus infection 
will require a great deal more research before there could be any 
clinical application 
we are evaluating the very important question of whether this 
glutathione deficiency is relevant or does it have nothing to 
do with immune dysfunction that is a possibility said crystal 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system leaving it unable to 
resist other infections hiv which causes aids is spread most 
often through sexual relations through contact with blood or blood 
products such as by sharing needles or from mother to child 
during the birth process 
as of sept 30 aids had been diagnosed in 109167 americans of 
whom more than half or 64849 have died since june 1 1981 
according to the centers for disease control no one is known to 
have recovered from aids

tens of thousands of armenians rallied thursday in 
yerevan and demanded that their lawmakers defy moscow by declaring 
the disputed nagornokarabakh region part of a unified armenian 
republic local journalists said 
unconfirmed reports from the caucasus region in the southern 
part of the soviet union said as many as three people were killed 
in violence stemming from the sovereignty quarrel over the 
predominantly armenian district inside the neighboring republic of 
azerbaijan adding to a 22month toll of about 100 deaths 
in moscow the soviet legislature on tuesday overwhelmingly 
approved a resolution disbanding a special commission that had 
imposed direct kremlin rule on the hilly region of 160000 people 
which was made part of azerbaijan in 1923 despite its overwhelming 
armenian majority 
the resolution passed by the soviet legislature says the area is 
part of azerbaijan as provided in the 1977 soviet constitution 
and will now be controlled by local government bodies under the 
supervision of an allunion commission 
instead of calming the situation the supreme soviets 
resolution exacerbated it a government spokesman said 
one has to regret that passions are flying high and the people 
do not understand the very meaning the very sense of what this 
decision contains foreign ministry yuri a gremitskikh said in 
moscow 
in yerevan armenias capital the republics supreme soviet 
legislature and lawmakers from nagornokarabakh met in a special 
session to debate the moscow legislatures resolution said armen 
dulyan a spokesman for the republics official armenpress news 
agency 
levon terpetrosyan a member of the soviet congress of peoples 
deputies presented a draft resolution that would declare 
nagornokarabakh part of a unified armenian republic dulyan 
said 
nagornokarabakhs armenian population supported by armenia 
has demanded that it be annexed to armenia because of what it calls 
years of willful neglect by azerbaijani authorities 
the unified armenian republic will take all necessary measures 
to defend nagornokarabakh and its citizens from all outside 
encroachments as part of the republics territory dulyan quoted 
the resolution introduced by terpetrosyan as saying 
speaking by telephone from yerevan dulyan said a massive 
crowd of tens of thousands of armenians rallied outside yerevans 
house of political education where the lawmakers were meeting to 
demand the resolution be adopted 
after hours of heated debate the lawmakers voted to establish a 
commission to work through the night to draft a response to the 
moscowbased supreme soviets resolution the armenpress journalist 
said 
in azerbaijan businesses are reported to be on strike and 
freight trains bound for nagornokarabakh and armenia to be idled 
as azerbaijanis express displeasure with the resolution 
savili a perets deputy director of azerbaijans official news 
agency azerinform said some azerbaijanis believe the observer 
commission encroaches on their republics sovereignty and that the 
resolutions provision barring changes in nagornokarabakhs 
demographics means azerbaijani women cannot give birth in the 
region 
speaking by telephone from azerbaijans capital of baku perets 
said he had received unofficial reports of three people killed 
tuesday in attacks related to the dispute he could not provide 
details of the incidents

checkered arab scarves over their faces later marched through the 
village and announced on loudspeakers they had killed the wrong man 
arab reporters said the attackers also warned that they were 
still seeking the collaborator the slain man was identified as 
mamoun ali almasri 18 
the army said it was checking the reports 
it confirmed the death thursday of a suspected collaborator who 
was injured three days earlier in a firebomb attack hospital 
officials identified him as ribhi ibrahim bader 33 of the west 
bank village of beit liqya 
the deaths raised to at least 153 the number of palestinians 
killed by fellow arabs in the uprising against israeli rule of the 
west bank and gaza strip most were suspected of collaboration or 
of drug dealing or prostitution 
israeli soldiers and civilians have killed 617 palestinians

an environmental protection agency official 
said thursday that environmental concerns will play a key role in 
the 1990 farm bill 
f henry habicht the epas deputy administrator told an 
agriculture conference that his agency has been working with 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter to work out proposals for the 
legislation which will set farm policy for several years 
he commended agricultural officials for a visionary view in 
response to public concerns about pesticides and food safety 
farmers were the first environmentalists said habicht he 
said encouraging farmers to use wise environmental methods is not 
an attitude issue but an information issue 
agriculture deputy secretary jack parnell who appeared with 
habicht took a hard line toward food safety questions raised by 
environmental organizations 
do not be afraid of your critics or their noise he told 
the participants at the closing program of outlook 90 a threeday 
conference sponsored by the agriculture department 
he said that technology has made american agriculture the most 
successful in the world partly through use of chemicals 
he cautioned against those who would like to tear down and 
destroy by quoting half truths from pseudoscientists 
he said breakthroughs in science have enabled researchers to 
detect chemical residues in food in much smaller quantities than 
ever before 
he questioned whether ingestion of a one part per trillion of a 
particular residue over a 70year lifetime should be legislated 
against 
dont allow policy to move ahead of science or common sense 
he said 
he said he does support speedy removal from the market of 
chemicals that have been determined hazardous to health and hailed 
president bushs legislative proposals for streamlining laws that 
do just that 
when the united states sits down to supper it should expect a 
wholesome supper with the safest food in the world parnell said 
dr frank young outgoing commissioner of the food and drug 
administration also questioned the need to be concerned about 
minute quantities of chemical residues in food 
in the 1960s and 70s we began to identify compounds that 
might cause cancer he said but we could only identify one 
part per 1000 or one part per 10000 
today scientists can detect one part per trillion or one part 
per million trillion he said 
that ability has allowed residue to be detected that could not 
be found before but is not necessarily harmful to health he said 
we must be very careful that the nations health or economy 
does not fall prey to selfappointed priests of demagoguery said 
young 
habicht acknowledged the farmers central role in the american 
economy and said his agency has no interest in retarding 
agricultural productivity 
but he said that for the past 20 years weve been 
identifying problems and scrambling to clean up 
he said the policies of the future must be preventive

denvers new airport could someday have a home 
where the buffalo roam the deer and the antelope already play 
there 
landscape architects for the denver international airport 
opening by 1993 would like to introduce great plains buffalo to 
grazing areas along the 12mile airport boulevard corridor to give 
travelers the flavor of the wild west 
prairie grasses and other plants would be planted to nurture the 
herds of deer and antelope traipsing through the creek beds and 
farmland on the 50squaremile site 
it would have a tremendous impact on the incoming passenger 
dick marshall of dhm inc landscapers marshalls company is part 
of a joint venture being paid 1 million to plan flora and fauna 
for the 3 billionplus airport 
the buffalo would be fenced in much like the herd that grazes 
along interstate 70 west of denver to keep them away from the busy 
route 
the fences would be at the bottom of road embankments to ensure 
good wildlife viewing and allow the animals to come as close to 
travelers as possible 
marshalls team also wants to plant and populated the corridor 
with everything from foothills pine trees to bald eagles and 
landscape the terminal itself with greenery to promote the image of 
an oasis on the plains

liberalization in the communist bloc is 
providing an unexpected opportunity for historians to examine 
longhidden documents on nazi germanys extermination of european 
jewry 
tens of thousands of documents from east germany and others 
expected from the soviet union may answer such central questions as 
how many jews really died which could be more than the accepted 6 
million researchers said thursday 
despite four decades of scholarship on the holocaust the 
unavailability of eastern accounts has left gaping holes in 
knowledge about the world war ii slaughter said shmuel krakowsky 
head archivist at israels yad vashem holocaust memorial 
the largest mystery has been the fate of soviet jews how many 
were killed how they died and where they died 
we have never been able to compile final figures of how many 
died it could be that far fewer succeeded in escaping executions 
than we imagined krakowsky said 
himself a survivor of the lodz ghetto in wartime poland 
krakowsky is in charge of reviewing 50000 pages of east german 
documents about a third of which were brought to jerusalem this 
week by archivists from berlin 
the documents have arrived in advance of a cooperation agreement 
that israeli and east german researchers are scheduled to sign 
monday krakowsky said he scanned some of the information while on 
a visit to east germany in 1988 
in september krakowsky and yad vashems director yitzhak arad 
spent three weeks studying thousands of pages of newly available 
holocaust documents in moscow leningrad minsk odessa and kiev 
the material in the soviet and german archives suggested new 
directions in investigating how the nazis operated in the soviet 
union krakowsky said 
we were astounded to read of documented persecutions names 
and places we hadnt been aware of he said it adds a lot to 
our information about the holocaust until now knowledge of the 
fate of soviet jewry in the war has been scant 
mordechai altshuler an expert on the soviet union at 
jerusalems hebrew university said the documents may establish a 
firmer figure on deaths than the current range of 125 million to 
18 million 
altshuler said this could affect the overall estimte of 6 
million dead more material on the subject could change the 
picture one way or the other he said 
krakowsky said it was premature to make a new estimate but 
added he believed the death toll could be larger than believed 
we saw names of death sites we hadnt seen before and lists of 
names he said 
another question raised is what kind of extermination methods 
the nazis used in the soviet union and what role local 
collaborators were given krakowsky said 
until now it was believed that russian jewry perished mostly at 
the hands of german firing squads known as einsatzgruppen who mowed 
them down at the edge of huge dirt pits in the initial stages of 
the war 
it seems the process in the soviet union may have been 
lengthier with a wider use of gathering jews first in ghettos and 
hiring local police to do some of the killing krakowsky said 
he noted that some soviet documents indicate there were more 
sites for rounding up jews in towns and cities than previously 
thought 
karkowsky cited the town of homel in byelorussia where 
historians believed the germans had organized one jewish ghetto 
new documents showed there were four ghettoes suggesting more jews 
may have been killed there than believed he said 
east german documents also may shed light on nazi theoretician 
alfred rosenberg who was in charge of destroying synagogues and 
on the shadowy alliance between hitler and jerusalems late moslem 
mufti haj amin el husseini krakowsky said 
czechoslovakia also has begun contributing to knowledge of the 
holocaust by agreeing to send an exhibition of wartime judaic 
relics from prague to the israel museum in jerusalem 
the items scheduled for display next april are part of an 
enormous collection that the nazis had amassed for a memorial to an 
extinguished people according to museum director meir meir

the energy department today said it is suspending 
some plutonium operations at rocky flats while a new contractor 
takes over at the weapons plant which is under fbi investigation 
for alleged safety violations 
catherine kaliniak an energy department spokeswoman in 
washington said a major curtailment of plutonium operations at 
the plant will be completed sometime next week the plant makes 
plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons 
kaliniak would not disclose how many plutonium operations will 
continue saying that was classified information 
last year the plant was shut down temporarily after a safety 
violation the move came amid a rash of safety and management 
problems interruptions and shutdowns at the 16 major facilities in 
12 states involved in making nuclear weapons 
kaliniak said the rocky flats suspension had nothing to do with 
safety concerns and david p simonson manager of the energy 
department office at rocky flats said the move is part of the 
process by which egampg inc is taking over from rockwell 
international corp as operator of the plant 16 miles northwest of 
denver 
the department is using this transition period to work with 
egampg to establish a formal structured program for the resumption 
of nuclear facility operations simonson said the program now 
under development with egampg will ensure that future operations are 
governed by the highest standards of performance 
rep david skaggs dcolo had announced wednesday that he 
asked energy secretary james watkins in a nov 16 letter to halt 
production at rocky flats hours later simonson said the plant was 
already in the midst of a production curtailment that was scheduled 
in august began nov 13 and would continue through midjanuary 
skaggs whose district includes the plant said later wednesday 
that the curtailment falls far short of what i have called for 
skaggs said an energy department report last month indicated 
only luck has prevented a serious accident at rocky flats he said 
the report concluded the failsafe system at the plant is flawed 
and does not follow accepted nuclear industry standards and that 
the plant does not have adequate control over its plutonium stock 
simonson maintained that watkins has ordered essentially all 
the recommendations mentioned by congressman skaggs in his nov 16 
letter 
fbi agents earlier this year raided rocky flats for evidence of 
safety and environmental violations 
gov roy romer said watkins would visit rocky flats on friday 
and make more information available on the plants safety ms 
kaliniak said she could not confirm that watkins was even 
considering such a visit 
on a related issue romer and skaggs say they have concluded 
there were no illegal midnight burnings of toxic waste inside a 
topsecret building at the plant 
the allegation denied for months by rockwell and the energy 
department surfaced in an affidavit the fbi filed to support 
search warrants for a june 6 raid on the plant

gov bob martinez has accused one of 
the worlds leading aquariums of illegally taking two bottlenose 
dolphins from tampa bay but aquarium officials say its all a 
misunderstanding 
the governor directed officials wednesday to find out if the 
state can force release of the animals and to draft rules 
restricting the capture and transportation of dolphins from florida 
waters 
the national aquarium in baltimore did not have the correct 
state permit when it moved two male dolphins captured sunday in 
tampa bay to a holding facility at marathon in the florida keys 
said officials with the state department of natural resources 
it was a breach of state law and worse yet it flies in the 
face of our efforts to protect these special mammals martinez 
wrote in his letter to dnr executive director tom gardner gardner 
said he has asked his attorneys to investigate the situation 
officials of the national aquarium said the only problem was a 
technical flaw in their permit 
weve been so meticulous and careful about every single aspect 
of the collection process said aquarium spokeswoman vicki 
aversa its just a shame that this kind of situation has to 
happen 
state and federal officials said jay sweeney a marine mammal 
veterinarian had a federal permit to capture up to three dolphins 
anywhere along the gulf coast 
but a state permit is needed to move the dolphins and the 
permit sweeney obtained specified that he could transport dolphins 
only from charlotte harbor in lee county on floridas southwest 
coast 
sweeney moved the animals from tampa bay on tuesday without 
amending the permit said charles futch dnrs assistant director 
of marine resources ms aversa said the capture site was moved to 
tampa bay because of criticism raised over the plan to take 
dolphins from the charlotte harbor aquatic preserve 
ms aversa added that sweeney had been given verbal permission 
by the dnr to move the mammals from tampa bay there was no comment 
from sweeney neither acquarium nor state officials knew where he 
was thursday 
ms aversa said the dolphins will stay at marathon for most of 
the winter unless the state forces the aquarium to release them

the bush administration sharply criticized a 
un agency thursday for strengthening its cooperation with the 
palestine liberation organization and denying a us official the 
agencys chairmanship 
the state department spokeswoman said that in light of the 
agencys actions the united states was considering cutting off all 
financial support for the food and agriculture organization 
at a meeting of the faos general conference in rome 96 
countries voted for a resolution authorizing the agency to assist 
agricultural development on the west bank and in gaza in close 
cooperation with the plo 
the resolution accused israel which controls the territories 
of hampering economic development and denying land and water to 
palestinian residents 
the outcome of the conference was unacceptable to us for a 
number of reasons state department spokeswoman margaret d 
tutwiler said 
she called the resolution extremely objectionable and 
accused the fao of lagging behind in reforming its procedures and 
expanding its budget at the expense of the united states and a 
handful of other countries that bear most of the costs 
ms tutwiler also said dan amstutz of the united states had been 
denied his right under a rotation system to serve as chairman of 
the fao council 
referring to these actions the spokeswoman said this brings 
into serious question our funding of fao this is being seriously 
discussed here today but i am not prepared at this briefing to 
make an announcement of what action or actions the united states 
will be taking 
on another mideast issue ms tutwiler said egyptian foreign 
minister esmat abdel meguid had informed secretary of state james 
a baker iii that he could not approve a us proposal for setting 
up negotiations between israel and palestinians 
egypt has been dealing with baker in behalf of the plo 
evidently meguid requested some unspecified changes in the us 
approach 
but ms tutwiler said any clarifications would be considered 
only after egypt gave its yes to the us plan 
the israeli cabinet earlier gave its approval but also stated a 
number of reservations its main concern is that the plo not play a 
role in the negotiations 
the plo however is recognized by all arab countries as the 
only legitimate representative of the palestinians

a renegade cia agent who defected to the 
soviet union after allegedly passing secrets has been expelled from 
hungary a newspaper reported today 
it was not known where the defector edward lee howard went 
after his expulsion the los angeles times said 
howard who eluded us counterintelligence agents in new mexico 
in 1985 revealed to the soviets the names of people and technical 
equipment being used by the cia 
a us official told the times that federal authorities had been 
trying to persuade hungary to expel howard for months the 
newspaper said the united states is stepping up its efforts to 
apprehend howard 
our argument was heres this guy who cast his lot with the 
soviet union but tried to avoid the hardships of gulag socialism 
the unidentified official was quoted as saying 
hungary revoked his asylum at least a month ago despite protests 
by the kgb the soviet intelligence agency according to a us 
government source quoted by the newspaper 
asked about the report hungarian interior ministry spokesman 
lt col janos horvach said in a telephone interview its news 
to me 
the us embassy said it had no immediate information on the 
circumstances surrounding howards expulsion and soviet embassy 
spokesman sergei semyonov said i regret but we know nothing 
about such a man 
cia director william h webster made a veiled reference to 
howards expulsion in a speech wednesday at the national press club 
in washington 
he was asked about cooperation between intelligence services of 
east bloc countries and the soviets in light of the recent 
political developments in eastern europe 
webster cited the case of a prominent defector from the united 
states who was permanently expelled from a bloc country which had 
provided him comfort and sanctuary in the past and that would have 
been contrary to the wishes of the kgb 
david wise author of a book documenting howards defection 
said howard spent significant time in hungary after defecting to 
moscow 
it was a lot more western the closest he could get to the 
west wise said 
howards wife mary who lives in st paul minn with the 
couples daughter had spent up to three months with him in 
hungary the newspaper said

this steel and coal town in 
moravia has always been a communist party stronghold but even new 
party leader karel urbaneks roots in the region arent enough to 
stem the quest for reform 
the winds of change are strong even in this major industrial 
center although we are always days behind prague said dusan 
kubat a journalist and staunch supporter of the civic forum reform 
movement 
civic forum was a major force in the prodemocracy 
demonstrations that led to the downfall of former party chief milos 
jakes he was replaced by urbanek who is from bojkovice a village 
in southern moravia 
the situation is more complicated here said kubat 30 
people are more conservative but i think most workers are 
already with us 
workers crowding a beer hall appeared to support his assessment 
i am happy that the young ones started the fight said 
steelworker josef koukl i am already 40 but i would like to 
join them everybody who has a sense of justice should join them 
stanislav novak a 40yearold father of two put down his glass 
of plum brandy and nodded i would like my children to live in a 
better world 
the civic forums call for a twohour general strike monday was 
heeded by most plants here with at least 20000 workers taking to 
the streets after sirens signaled the start 
at the zarubek coal mine however the management did not let 
us gather and waited until the last moment before it allowed a 
group of miners to come up to take part in the strike said a 
technician met at the gate who refused to give his name 
a rumor spread among miners before the strike that participants 
would lose their christmas bonus of up to 900 
miners draw up to three times the national workers pay once 
they work above ground however their wage is slashed 
substantially unless they are diagnosed to be suffering from 
silicosis complaints from their ranks that silicosis victims are 
increasingly being refused full pay were cited as a factor 
prompting the large miner participation in the strike 
the local communist party organized a rally wednesday on 
ostravas peoples militia square at which traditional 
overallclad workers were noticeably absent 
one speaker was worker jaroslav cahlik who called on the prague 
government to immediately stop the talks with the opposition 
the mostly middleaged crowd of about 5000 including a group 
of army officers broke into chants of long live the communist 
party we are still here while a group of about 100 younger 
onlookers rose their arms in the victory sign of the opposition 
they may still be here but without power said one 
bystander 
alexandra hnikova a 29yearold textile worker joined in the 
proparty chants 
i will be with the party no matter what happens she said 
of course there have been mistakes but that will change 
now she added after a browncoated man whispered something into 
her ear 
ostrava has a mining engineering college where students are on 
an indefinite strike to press for the resignation of their rector 
an orthodox communist the strike is being led by a teacher of 
marxismleninism 
most of the mines in the region are no longer profitable but the 
party has opposed shutting them down for fear of stirring 
discontent their future is likely to figure in upcoming 
discussions about economic reforms 
i am afraid that the economic situation will become worse 
said mechanic ladislav mlynar outside ostravas hotel atom as smoke 
billowed from a nearby blast furnace 
the changes are so fast said passerby ondreas imrich i 
still fear that everything will end in a deadend street again or 
that it will be suppressed

consumer spending fell to its lowest level in 
nearly three years in october the government said thursday and 
analysts said continued sluggishness in personal consumption is 
likely to be a major drag on the economy in the fourth quarter 
on the other hand personal income rose a healthy 09 percent 
which analysts said indicates consumers still have spending power 
but are just waiting for bargains 
its not going to be a great christmas in terms of shopping 
and retail earnings said sandra shaber an economist with the 
futures group a washington consulting firm people will just 
wait until things go on sale 
the commerce department said that spending reflecting 
plummeting auto sales in october dropped 02 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 353 trillion after edging up 
only 03 percent in september 
it was the first decline in personal spending since a 01 
percent drop in september 1988 and the steepest since a 14 percent 
fall in january 1987 
consumer spending accounts for about twothirds of the nations 
economic activity and the spending report provided fresh evidence 
that the economy is continuing to slow 
consumer spending is starting the fourth quarter on an 
extremely weak note said david jones an economist with aubrey 
g lanston amp co in new york and since it represents twothirds 
of the gross national product i think it will be a major drag on 
the economy in the fourth quarter 
income on the other hand totaled 451 trillion reflecting 
the largest advance since a 1 percent gain last march it had risen 
03 percent in september 
the san francisco bayarea earthquake knocked 21 billion out of 
the income figure at an annual rate but that was partially offset 
by other onetime special factors including a 72 billion 
increase in farm subsidies and 68 billion in bonuses to auto 
industry employees 
excluding the impact of the special factors personal income 
increased about 33 billion or 07 percent the commerce 
department said 
jones and mrs shaber while expecting a weak fourthquarter 
economy said the report by itself does not indicate an imminent 
recession 
first income numbers have been too strong to be consistent 
with a recession mrs shaber said and on the other hand 
people are still spending theyre just being very very 
cautious waiting for things to go on sale 
jones agreed saying that consumers still have buying power but 
are more cautious and they want to bargain 
americans incomes after taxes rose 09 percent up from 
septembers 02 percent gain commerce said 
their savings rate savings as a percent of disposable income 
rose to 57 percent the highest since a 58 percent rate last june 
and compared to septembers 47 percent 
the key component of the income category wages and salaries 
rose 33 billion compared to a 17 billion gain in september 
payrolls at manufacturing companies rose by 68 billion but 
would have been flat except for the 68 billion in auto bonuses 
the manufacturing sector has been one of the hardest hit by federal 
reserve efforts to fight inflation 
on the spending side the 61 billion decrease in personal 
consumption which includes everything except interest payments on 
debt compared to a 99 billion gain in september when incentives 
drove auto sales up 
purchases of durable goods bigticket items expected to last 
more than three years dropped 282 billion while nondurable 
goods purchases rose 25 billion spending on services rose 202 
billion

a former narcotics detective 
has been arrested in the assassinations of two prominent white 
activists one in south africa and one in namibia police said 
thursday 
police headquarters refused to release the name of the 
31yearold suspect saying it confirmed his arrest only after 
newspapers reported it an official statement said further arrests 
in the slayings were possible 
an evening news report on governmentrun tv said it was believed 
police are looking at the possible existence of a private 
assassination squad with strong rightwing links 
the suspect a white former police sergeant was arrested this 
month in the killings of david webster a university lecturer and 
human rights activist in johannesburg and anton lubowski a lawyer 
who was the only senior white official of namibias main 
independence movement the southwest africa peoples organization 
both men were shot to death outside their homes webster on may 
1 in johannesburg and lubowski on sept 12 in windhoek namibia 
the suspect had not been charged and was being held for 
questioning under the provisions of security legislation that 
allows for indefinite detention without access to visitors or 
lawyers 
the star a liberal johannesburg daily said the suspects 
father had filed an application demanding his sons release from a 
johannesburg police station cell but later withdrew the request 
police said the suspect was discharged from the police force in 
1984 after being sentenced to prison on charges of murder and 
theft he was convicted of killing a suspect in one of his 
investigations as a narcotics officer for the west rand a region 
west of johannesburg 
the person has been in detention for some time police said 
the police did not wish to announce his detention because this 
would have jeopardized an investigation which still has to be 
launched 
the national police force has come under widespread criticism 
for its failure to solve the webster murder and dozens of other 
killings of antiapartheid activists over the past 10 years 
the arrest coincides with a government investigation into 
allegations by former policemen that police death squads acting on 
orders from superiors killed numerous government opponents 
an irish national donald acheson 51 was arrested in namibia 
the day after lubowski was killed he had been held as an illegal 
immigrant but on nov 6 was told he would be charged in the 
slaying 
newspapers have reported that acheson was taken to johannesburg 
for interrogation by authorities who fought the court application 
for the exnarcotics officers release those authorities also are 
investigating websters assassination 
also on thursday 
scores of protesting black bakery workers in pretoria 
reportedly were injured and 200 arrested by riot police using tear 
gas and clubs police said five officers were hurt by bread crates 
hurled from rooftops 
hundreds of workers gathered at the boerstra bakery in pretoria 
to protest working conditions neil coleman a spokesman for the 
congress of south african trade unions said riot police attacked 
the workers without provocation police said the protesters ignored 
repeated warnings to disperse 
police in the impoverished township of alexandra near 
johannesburg used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse 500 
blacks protesting living conditions in their township four people 
reportedly were arrested 
six antiapartheid activists met with african national 
congress leader nelson mandela and later said they did not believe 
he would be freed from prison this year billy nair former natal 
province leader of the outlawed anc military wing did not comment 
on the more prominent expectation that mandela would be freed early 
next year president fw de klerk said the matter is receiving 
attention we will make an announcement when we are ready 
de klerk prepared to travel to the ivory coast for a meeting 
friday with president felix houphouetboigny to discuss mutual 
relations and the angolan civil war the two countries have no 
formal diplomatic relations but extensive trade ties 
houphouetboigny condemns apartheid south africas legal system of 
racial separation but criticizes as counterproductive sanctions to 
force south africa to give equal rights to its black majority

a man once identified as a viable suspect in 
the green river serial killings is no longer a suspect the 
commander of a task force investigating the slayings said today 
king county police capt robert evans told kingtv that records 
removed from william jay stevens iis home and other information 
gathered by detectives eliminated stevens as a suspect 
stevens 39 is in jail awaiting trial on federal firearms 
charges involving guns found in a search of his and his parents 
homes in spokane by the green river task force and spokane police 
stevens who was arrested in january was investigated in 
connection with the deaths and disappearances of 49 women most of 
them prostitutes who vanished from 1982 to 1984 mostly in the 
seattle area the case named for the river where the first five 
victims were found is the worst known unsolved serial murder case 
in the nation 
an affidavit filed by the task force to obtain the search 
warrant identified stevens as a viable suspect in the green 
river slayings 
stevens was never charged with any of the killings and has said 
he is innocent 
the search of stevens and his parents homes uncovered guns 
boxes of pornographic tapes police paraphernalia and uniforms and 
credit card records that helped investigators trace stevens 
travels 
they also found a car equipped much like a police cruiser green 
river investigators have speculated that the green river killer 
posed as a police officer to trap his victims 
stevens was indicted in october on charges of being a felon in 
possession of a firearm stevens a former law student at gonzaga 
university in spokane had escaped from a workrelease center in 
1981 while serving time for a 1979 burglary at a police equipment 
supply company

california and new york are the biggest 
winners but all states will reap dividends from a decision by 
congress forgiving 14 billion in hotlycontested federal 
penalties under a huge family aid program 
the penalties were owed by all 50 states because of alleged 
overpayments to beneficiaries under aid to families with dependent 
children the federalstate welfare program for children who lack 
parental financial support 
about 37 million families receive afdc the nations largest 
cash assistance program 
the biggest penalty to be wiped out belonged to california 
3087 million according to federal funds information for states 
a research group new york owed 2859 million michigan 1340 
million and ohio 1046 million 
no state had avoided the penalties although south dakota owed a 
just 13000 and nevada owed 18000 
forgiving the debts and reforming the way states are penalized 
for overpayments is extremely significant said alicia pelrine 
of the national governors association this is something weve 
been pushing for for years its a tough technical gutitout 
issue she said 
we were delightfully surprised said jerry friedman deputy 
secretary for income maintenance at the department of public 
welfare of pennsylvania which owed 923 million 
obviously if we were forced to pay up it would have made our 
system hemorrhage it would have been disastrous friedman said 
he said the state had been preparing to challenge the debt in court 
the 14 billion is an estimate that includes only state 
overpayments made from the 1981 through the 1987 fiscal years when 
figures for the 1988 and 1989 fiscal years are totaled the amount 
of forgiveness could run as high as 22 billion according to the 
office of management and budget 
the afdc amnesty provision was contained in a 147 billion 
budget bill passed by both houses of congress last week in the rush 
to adjourn before thanksgiving 
omb had backed a cheaper afdc plan that did not include a full 
waiver of states obligations according to omb spokeswoman delores 
spitznagel still she said the budget measure is expected to be 
signed by the president 
the revenue losses caused by the amnesty plan are more than 
offset in the measure by dozens of deficitreduction provisions 
including the extension into february of spending cuts imposed in 
october under the grammrudman deficitreduction law 
the issue of afdc overpayments has long caused rancor between 
states and the federal government 
since federal money is involved the government monitors the 
program and assesses penalties when states accidentally make 
overpayments to beneficiaries or grant aid to people who do not 
qualify 
under program regulations in effect since 1983 any state with 
an error rate of 3 percent or above is subject to penalties and 
interest 
but states have long held that the 3 percent tolerance level 
is arbitrary and ignores the realities of administering the program 
states cite compliance figures showing that 41 states could not 
manage error rates of less than 3 percent in any year during the 
period 
the new program enacted by congress eliminates the 3 percent 
error rate replacing it with a 4 percent figure or the national 
average whichever is higher penalties would be assessed on a 
sliding scale reflecting the degree to which a states errors 
exceed the national rate 
david siegel a spokesman for the family support administration 
the division of the department of health and human services that 
oversees afdc said congress apparently decided to give the 
program a fresh start 
this gives all levels of government the opportunity to start 
with a clean slate and have a qualitycontrol system that is 
operational and functional siegel said 
the new system begins in october 1991

the japanese again reached into the upper echelons 
of the world art market thursday outbidding a parisian dealer to 
buy a picasso masterpiece for 489 million a record for a work 
by the artist 
pierrettes wedding a longdisappeared masterpiece from 
picassos famed blue period was bought by nippon autopolis co in 
an auction linking bidders in paris and tokyo by live satellite tv 
action at the drouotmontaigne auction house was a tense duel 
between an unidentified japanese bidder in toyko and herve 
odermatt a wellknown paris art dealer 
when the bidding topped odermatts offer of 459 million he 
paused for several seconds the standingroomonly room packed with 
celebrities fell silent 
odermatt finally shook his gray head indicating he would go no 
higher auctioneer jeanclaude binoche banged the gavel and the 
painting belonged to the japanese company 
of course im very disappointed especially since i was so 
close to getting it odermatt said in an interview during the 
few seconds i hesitated and i knew everyone was waiting i kept 
thinking about the condition of the painting thats what finally 
made me decide to let it go 
odermatt said presale estimates that the painting would go for 
50 million to 70 million were not justified 
i spent half an hour last night examining the work and it was 
worn and awfully varnished he said if it had been in perfect 
condition the sky was the limit 
the poignant group portrait painted in 1905 will have a new home 
in a specially built museum located in an autoracing theme resort 
in the mountains of southern japan 
we felt we absolutely must have the real thing a real 
masterpiece like this for our museum said takeshi inaba senior 
managing director of nippon autopolis were very happy to have 
bought the painting 
the previous picasso record was held by yo picasso which 
sold for 4785 million at sothebys in may 
the record for any work of art 539 million dollars was set 
in 1987 for vincent van goghs irises 
thursdays sale also included a series of 26 paintings by 
american pop artist andy warhol titled ladies and gentlemen 
they were sold in tokyo for prices ranging from between onehalf to 
twothirds their presale estimates 
it was a big mistake to auction the warhols in tokyo and 
paris said french collector alain lesieutre they would have 
brought top dollar in the united states 
lesieutre called the price paid for the picasso ridiculously low 
its a gift a giveaway its a masterpiece and should have 
brought much more but the french are afraid of big money he 
said 
on hand for the sale was picassos daughter paloma who blamed 
the lack of excitement and relatively low price on the presence of 
tv cameras the atmosphere was cold she said 
pierrettes wedding is considered one of picassos most 
important paintings because of its unusually large size its 
hauntingly beautiful blues and pinks and its harlequin theme 
the painting shows six figures probably circus performers 
sitting around a table celebrating with an unsmiling newlywed 
couple the bride her head draped with a spanishstyle mantilla 
has eyes only for her lover whom she has abandoned to marry an 
older richer man pictured in a top hat 
its a transitional painting that announces all the colors and 
forms that will dominate picassos works for years to come said 
isabelle de wavrin art critic for beaux arts magazine 
the painting was put up for sale by swedish industrialist 
frederik roos who acquired it in 1988 the painting was granted a 
visa to leave france only after roos donated another picasso from 
the blue period la celestine to the louvre 
although art historians are familiar with the dozens of sketches 
picasso drew in preparation for pierrettes wedding the final 
work disappeared years ago changing hands many times before 
surfacing in 1988 in a picasso retrospective

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev proposed 
thursday that a summit of european nations the united states and 
canada be held next year to speed up the integration of europe and 
eliminate eastwest divisions 
gorbachev said the meeting he called helsinki 2 should be 
moved up from 1992 as originally called for under the 1975 helsinki 
accords on human rights and security in europe 
he made the proposal in a speech from the michelangelodesigned 
campidoglio romes city hall where the treaty was signed in 1957 
establishing the european common market 
gorbachev said the sweeping changes in eastern europe are 
irrevocable he insisted they do not signal the collapse of 
socialism but rather the further development of a concept with 
noble goals and enormous humanistic and democratic potential 
on the eve of his historic meeting with pope john paul ii 
gorbachev said that soviets have changed their attitude toward 
religion and now believe religious values can help in the 
restructuring of soviet society 
gorbachevs 20minute speech delivered while standing in front 
of a 12foothigh statue of julius caesar was interrupted three 
times by applause from several hundred dignitaries at the end 
they stood and clapped politely 
expanding on his desire to build a common european home 
gorbachev said recent events presumably the dramatic rush toward 
reform in eastern europe underscore the desirability of an 
alleuropean summit a helsinki 2 meeting we could consider 
advancing its date from 1992 to say as early as 1990 
the soviet union had been pressing for an international human 
rights conference to be held in moscow next year as part of the 
process leading toward the next 35nation conference on security 
and cooperation in europe 
the conference last met in helsinki in 1975 when the united 
states the soviet union canada and all european countries except 
albania signed the helsinki accords concerning military security 
economic cooperation and human rights 
in the final analysis gorbachev said we envision europe 
as a commonwealth of sovereign democratic states with a high level 
of equitable interdependence and easily accessible borders open to 
the exchange of products technologies and ideas and wideranging 
contacts among people 
although he did not repeat it in his speech thursday the soviet 
union has said it is prepared to negotiate dissolution of the 
warsaw pact and nato the united states has rejected the suggestion 
pending further progress in nuclear and conventional arms control 
talks 
gorbachev who was baptized in the russian orthodox church but 
rose through the ranks of the officially atheist communist party 
said the soviets have abandoned the claim to have a monopoly on 
the truth we no longer think that we are the best and that we are 
always right that those who disagree with us are our enemies 
and he said soviets have changed their attitude toward religion 
which admittedly we used to treat in a simplistic manner 
religion has been rejected to some extent in all major social 
upheavals not just the communist revolution he said but now we 
not only proceed from the assumption that no one should interfere 
in matters of the individuals conscience we also say that the 
moral values which religion generated and embodied for centuries 
can help in the work of renewal in our country too in fact this 
is already happening 
gorbachev goes to the vatican on friday for the first meeting 
between the pope and a soviet communist party chief on saturday 
he begins a twoday summit with president bush on ships in the 
mediterranean 
gorbachev rejected suggestions that removal of barriers between 
east and west can only be accomplished if the soviet union abandons 
its ideological and social values 
frankly we are often told that we should purely and simply 
renounce socialism he said then it is said the world will 
become a nice and easy place to live in this is not the 
approach that the world needs as it is taking a great turn to a new 
era 
today the focus is on the socialist world he said 
having embarked upon the road of radical reform the socialist 
countries one after another are crossing the line beyond which 
there is no return to the past 
nevertheless he said it is wrong to insist as many in 
the west do that this is the collapse of socialism the end of the 
socialist system on the contrary it means that the socialist 
process in the world having accumulated extensive although 
admittedly dramatic experience will pursue its further development 
in a multiplicity of forms 
referring to his meetings with bush gorbachev said he is 
convinced the talks will enable us to take a new constructive 
step in the movement from mutual understanding to mutual action in 
sovietus relations 
earlier in the day at the conclusion of two days of highlevel 
talks italy and the soviet union issued a statement saying that 
curtain of mistrust between the east and the west is crumbling 
in an accompanying accord signed by the foreign ministers of 
both countries italy offered to help the soviets convert military 
plants to civilian use

the state department said thursday it would 
allow journalists from poland and hungary to apply for passes 
enabling them to move around the building unescorted 
this step is being decided in light of the momentous steps 
toward freedom which have already taken place in both hungary and 
poland said margaret tutwiler the departments spokeswoman 
polish and hungarian journalists who attend the daily press 
briefing or visit the press office on a regular basis can apply for 
building passes that give them the same privileges as colleagues 
from the united states and other western countries tutwiler said 
in may 1987 the state department attempted to strengthen 
security at the building by barring unescorted visits by 
journalists from the soviet union east germany bulgaria 
czechoslovakia romania poland and hungary 
those reporters were required to have escorts when they attended 
the press briefing or conducted interviews with diplomats the 
restrictions apply to all but polish and hungarian reporters

suburban postal carriers had such good 
results paying their customers for wrongly delivered mail that the 
program intended as only a 60day trial will continue 
indefinitely officials say 
since late september every properly addressed letter delivered 
to the wrong address in suburban worthington has cost carriers 25 
cents out of their own pockets but most carriers say they dont 
mind they say their reputations are at stake 
its just a small way of telling our patrons that we are 
concerned about our jobs and we try to do a decent job said tom 
harris a letter carrier for six years we want them to know the 
whole postal system is not lousy 
the 60day trial program modeled on one in highpoint nc was 
supposed to end last saturday 
union and postal officials say the program has been successful 
considering the 125000 pieces of mail the branch handles a day 
people are taking a lot of pride in what they do and its 
worked well for them said douglas gulley president of the 
letter carriers local that represents worthington branch employees 
harris said he had only one errant delivery during the two 
months of the program 
i must have misread it he said 
during the first 60 days of the program participating postal 
workers paid customers a total of 11 for 44 pieces of wrongly 
delivered mail station manager robert summers said most of the 
mistakes occurred in the past three weeks as substitutes filled in 
for vacations and illness of regular carriers he said 
the number of customer complaints has dropped from an average of 
10 calls per week to one call a week since the program began 
summers said 
of the branchs 45 mail carriers 25 participated in the 
program carriers at the station wednesday who did not participate 
declined to be interviewed 
gulley said many carriers have highvolume business routes with 
mail bundled by other employees and dont want to be responsible 
for someone elses mistakes 
carrier cindy williams offered another reason for program 
holdouts its the holidays and i think a lot of people are 
afraid to join a lot of them are on new routes and they dont 
want to be broke for christmas 
ms williams a letter carrier for three years said her 
customers praised the program and most assured her they would 
never turn her in 
but ms williams said she paid 25 cents to a business customer 
during the program 
i dont know if i was the one that delivered that day but i 
was the one they put down she said 
the program began after a local magazine chided the branch for 
its poor service summers said he said carriers read about a 
similar program in highpoint nc and decided to try and salvage 
their reputations 
the highpoint program started last dec 23 with about 28 city 
and rural carriers of 79 total routes participating so far 
theyve paid customers 78 quarters said postmaster enola mixon 
about 15 carriers have not paid out any quarters 
we got i dont know how many nice compliments the customers 
thought it was just great mrs mixon said 
from dec 23 to jan 24 they delivered more than a million 
pieces of mail and gave out 37 quarters mostly on routes handled 
by substitutes if substitutes didnt participate in the program 
the quarter was paid by management and the union president at the 
time 
officials will meet in the next couple of weeks to assess the 
highpoint program and see if any changes need to be made 
us postal service officials and the national association of 
letter carriers which represents mail carriers said they were not 
aware of similar programs elsewhere in the nation

east german authorities thursday stripped 
former leader erich honecker of immunity from criminal charges and 
began an investigation of alleged abuses of power by honecker other 
disgraced communist party officials 
authorities also sealed off a country estate where honecker and 
other ousted leaders have lived apparently to prevent removal of 
evidence 
the moves were the strongest indications to date that the former 
leadership will be made to account for alleged abuses 
everyone is equal before the law communist party chief egon 
krenz said on national television he said the accusations against 
honecker and others are serious and unworthy of a politburo 
member 
the official adn news agency reported later that more than 
10000 east germans marched in the city of erfurt to protest 
special privileges for top party and government figures 
adn announced a criminal investigation into alleged abuse of 
power by honecker former premier willi stoph and former politburo 
member guenther kleiber who are all in seclusion their 
whereabouts is not known 
the news agency said honecker who was dropped from power oct 
18 was under investigation on suspicion of having misused his 
office for personal gain it gave no details of the alleged abuses 
krenz a former protege of honeckers has been pressing for 
exposure and punishment of past errors and excesses as a means of 
repairing his partys tarnished image 
krenz faces widespread opposition from many prodemocracy 
activists as well as within the troubled party hierarchy that 
meets in a crucial session dec 1517 
the party that has dominated government and society for 40 years 
also is wrestling with challenges and demands for broader 
powersharing by the fledgling political opposition 
the communist party last week announced an internal 
investigation of reported wrongdoing by honecker his top 
lieutenant guenter mittag and other party figures recently removed 
from positions of authority 
mittag was thrown out of the party nov 23 in the first punitive 
action against any of the ousted officials 
the aging party figures who were part of the hardline regime 
headed by honecker for 18 years are accused by prodemocracy forces 
of having lined their pockets at public expense while the national 
economy slipped continuously behind that of west germany 
regional government chief hartmut boecker said the immunity 
honecker was earlier entitled to was suspended to facilitate a 
criminal investigation and inquiry adn reported 
local authorities also have imposed a security cordon around the 
residential estate to prevent the removal of material from the 
buildings boecker was quoted by adn as saying 
the move appeared to be aimed at both preserving evidence that 
might be used against the former leaders in a criminal trial and 
preventing the residents from absconding with valuables from the 
state compound 
east german newspapers reported wednesday that stoph had 
abandoned his opulent home in a former nature preserve after 
hauling out artwork and furniture he left behind expensive 
electronics imported wine and other evidence of the lavish 
lifestyle previously enjoyed by the party elite 
adn gave no indication of what charges might be filed against 
any of the officials 
honecker 77 has not been seen in public since his ouster six 
weeks ago and is reported to be seriously ill 
krenz initially was seen as the former leaderships handpicked 
successor and therefore widely mistrusted but under public 
pressure for social and economic reforms the new party leadership 
has agreed to talks on the nations future beginning next week 
party leaders have also promised to give up their constitutional 
mandate for a leading role and have agreed to work toward free 
elections 
also thursday the governments chief spokesman declared 
national unity in the effort to resist moves toward reunification 
of the two german states 
wolfgang meyer told reporters at a press conference that the 
appeal issued by leading intellectuals and signed by krenz premier 
hans modrow and other top officials has won the support of the 
majority of the population including the various proreform 
movements pushing the communists to share power 
the appeal was announced after west german chancellor helmut 
kohl laid out a 10point plan to work for eventual reunification of 
germany a concept broadly resisted by east germans who want to 
remain a separate and sovereign state 
a signature drive has been launched for support of the appeal 
which declares east germany a socialist state independent of west 
germany

president bush preparing to leave for his 
weekend summit with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said 
today he hoped their talks would mark an important milestone toward 
molding a europe that is indeed whole and free 
gorbachev meanwhile called for a 35nation summit meeting next 
year to speed up the integration of europe and to eliminate 
eastwest divisions 
in a speech from romes city hall where a treaty was signed in 
1957 establishing the european common market gorbachev said a 
multinational meeting scheduled for 1992 under the helsinki accords 
on human rights and security in europe should be moved up 
earlier gorbachev joined his italian hosts in issuing a 
statement citing the changes toward democracy in countries such 
as poland hungary east germany bulgaria and czechoslovakia the 
statement reiterated the kremlins willingness to let those eastern 
bloc nations set their own courses 
bush said he thought he and his summit partner had similar goals 
ours is a powerful and historic opportunity he declared in 
a speech to members of his staff gathered in the windswept rose 
garden outside the white house 
as bush and gorbachev prepared to travel to the mediterranean 
the nearly 600member crew of the guided missile carrier uss 
belknap worked feverishly around visiting reporters and a tour of 
soviet sailors and officers to spruce up the ship and prepare its 
rooms for the heads of state 
bush who planned an early evening departure aboard air force 
one stressed his support for gorbachevs program of reform even 
as he hailed the changes sweeping eastern europe 
america understands the magnitude of mr gorbachevs 
challenges and let there be no misunderstanding we support 
perestroika he said 
bush added that he thought the people of all of europe 
understand that east and west are not in some kind of 
competition rather were both working to make the world a more 
peaceful one 
he added mr gorbachev and i see eye to eye on what our 
upcoming meeting is all about 
the sovietitalian statement declared that the curtain of 
mistrust between the east and west is crumbling 
it was issued in conjunction with the signing of accords by 
foreign ministers eduard a shevardnadze of the soviet union and 
gianni de michelis of italy pledging cooperation in converting 
military plants to civilian use combating drug trafficking 
protecting business investments and saving the environment 
the statement said both countries hoped talks in vienna on 
reducing conventional weapons would lead to an agreement by the end 
of next year 
bush said he and gorbachev can move beyond containment 
toward a europe that is indeed whole and free and one that has a 
level of security prosperity and peace as yet unknown in our 
lifetime 
in recent weeks cold war barriers to freedom have fallen across 
eastern europe including the beginning of the dismantling of the 
berlin wall with gorbachevs encouragement 
bushs sendoff ceremony was attended by nearly 300 
administration officials who filled the rose garden under blue 
skies and brisk winds 
as he left after the sixminute speech bush told reporters 
im ready for the meeting im ready and confident 
earlier at a cabinet meeting called to preview the session 
bush said he was confident gorbachev is looking at the meeting 
very much the same way we are 
he also said he received a full report wednesday night from 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney on his own meetings in 
moscow last week with gorbachev 
mulroney told reporters gorbachev isnt looking for miracles 
from malta but deserves help from the west such as observer status 
at world trade talks 
bush in an interview wednesday with newspaper correspondents 
that was released today by the white house was asked what changes 
he foresaw for the rival nato and warsaw pact military alliances 
its too early to predict how all this will play out but 
clearly its moving in the right direction and clearly its 
moving in a way that should result in a permanent reduction of the 
tensions that have been the hallmark of the cold war days the 
president said 
he said the unfolding changes in the once hardline communist 
states in eastern europe have given more of an urgency to the 
meeting since he first proposed it in july but he insisted 
theres been no change in my view as to what this meeting is to 
be about 
asked if the united states had sent gorbachev the message that 
it wants no surprises at malta bush said weve sent the message 
that we dont think there are going to be any but if he comes with 
something fine i mean this is an open thing he can say anything 
he wants but i think he wants to see a successful meeting 
he said he believes the soviets are not looking for 
confrontation i think that it is unlikely there will be 
something so dramatic that it puts us in an embarrassing position 
harnessing nuclear and conventional weapons also is on bushs 
agenda and while secretary of state james a baker iii says the 
sessions aboard us and soviet warships saturday and sunday will 
not amount to an arms control summit two sets of negotiations 
could get a shot in the arm 
the eventual result might be completion of treaties to reduce 
nato and warsaw pact troops tanks and artillery across europe and 
to slash us and soviet arsenals of longrange bombers missiles 
and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent by the time 
gorbachev visits washington next summer for a more formal summit 
negotiations are proceeding briskly in both arenas in vienna and 
geneva and the easing of tensions across the european landscape 
serves as a catalyst for even speedier resolution of the pacts 
still baker stressed at a white house news conference wednesday 
that the president would conduct no negotiations behind the backs 
of us allies 
immediately after the summit bush will fly to brussels to brief 
leaders of the 15 other north atlantic treaty organization 
governments 
gorbachev will use the summit to provide bush with a very 
frank assessment of his domestic woes and try to commit the 
united states to rapid progress on nuclear and conventional 
disarmament the washington post reported today quoting 
unidentified soviet officials 
the officials the newspaper said dont expect gorbachev to 
make any grand unilateral gestures but hinted that he might 
announce the withdrawal of some warships from the mediterranean and 
call for the region to be declared a nuclearfree zone

opposition politicians said thursday 
they had cleared the way for one of their leaders to become indias 
next prime minister 
the national fronts parliament members were scheduled to meet 
friday to officially elect vishwanath pratap singh head of the 
fiveparty national front coalition 
he then likely would be asked by the president to serve as prime 
minister 
guruswamy said another contender for the job chandra shekhar 
had been persuaded to withdraw his candidacy and that no one in 
the alliance would contest singhs nomination 
singh 58 could not be reached for comment thursday but he has 
insisted he does not want to replace prime minister rajiv gandhi 
singhs colleagues said he had no choice however 
he has to bow to the wishes of the people and the party he 
has no alternative said mohan guruswamy an associate 
gandhi resigned wednesday after his congress party failed to win 
a majority in last weeks parliamentary elections but president 
ramaswamy venkataraman asked him to continue until a new government 
is formed 
with results for all but two of the 525 parliament seats 
announced by thursday night the congress party had won the most 
seats at 192 its smallparty allies together won another 17 
the national front has 143 seats and has been promised support 
by the rightwing bharatiya janata party which has 90 seats and 
by several leftwing groups which won 51 
that would give the centrist national front 284 seats more than 
the 263 needed for a majority 
the rest of the seats went to small parties and independents who 
have not taken sides 
singh a former defense and finance minister is the bestknown 
leader in the national front but the mildmannered politician has 
said he just wants to be president of the peoples party the 
largest component of the national front 
singh is not sure he will be able to handle a hung house a 
senior leader of the national front said speaking on condition of 
anonymity thats why he was so hesitant to become the prime 
minister 
another source in the national front said singh was told he 
has no business to be in politics if he does not seek office 
in past elections one party almost always the congress party 
has won a comfortable majority in the absence of a majority the 
president chooses which party will form a government 
the congress party said on wednesday that it would not seek the 
job 
the national front has been dogged by highly publicized internal 
feuds since it was formed in august 1988 after elections were 
called in october the fronts leaders set aside their differences 
and united to oust gandhi 
but those differences started to surface this week and a leading 
newspaper said thursday they threaten the fronts chances for 
success 
the onus of bringing about a realignment of centrist forces 
once the government formed by the opposition has had the time to 
display its ineffectiveness is squarely with mr gandhi the 
independent times of india said

the endangered whooping crane population 
which suffered devastating losses in 1988 made a remarkable 
comeback this year a wildlife refuge manager says 
a total of 144 birds have been sighted at the aransas national 
wildlife refuge near rockport where they spend the winter before 
returning to their nesting grounds in canadas buffalo national 
park said brent giezentanner refuge manager 
were really happy as a matter of fact were ecstatic so 
far he said wednesday 
only 138 whooping cranes out of an expected 150 made it to the 
refuge last year biologists estimated that as many as a dozen 
birds may have died after leaving their canadian habitat 
one bird was shot by a houston lawyer who paid a 15000 fine 
giezentanner said 
a good sign this year is that of the 21 whooping crane chicks 
sighted and tagged in canada all but one made it to the texas 
refuge 
the increase in the worlds only remaining naturally reproducing 
flock of whooping cranes is the result of favorable nesting 
conditions in canada and the fact that many of the birds are 
reaching breeding age giezentanner said

a cheating investigation at the military 
security police academy at lackland air force base has led to the 
dismissal of 14 students and charges against one of them and an 
instructor authorities said 
this was the first time there was a suspected compromise of 
tests of this magnitude said base spokeswoman delores schroeder 
onethird of a law enforcement class at the school which trains 
police for all military branches was dismissed as a result of the 
investigation the san antonio light reported thursday 
the investigation started in september when officials looked 
into allegations that a marine instructor had sexual relations with 
a female navy student who in turn allegedly received test answers 
from the instructor 
the female student allegedly gave the answers to four navy 
colleagues at the academy authorities said 
those four navy students were dismissed from the academy 
although not from the military the woman student also was 
dismissed from the school and she and the marine instructor face 
courtsmartial the light reported ms schroeder said thursday 
that she didnt know the exact charges that are being brought 
while investigating that case air force officials uncovered 
information about a separate and larger cheating ring 
the two investigations are unrelated other than one 
investigation led to another air force lt col johnny whitaker 
said 
the instructor probe led investigators to information that nine 
other students at the security school had been using workbooks 
prepared by upperclassmen as they prepared for their exams 
ms schroeder said that the practice was not technically 
cheating but is considered unethical and the students were 
dismissed from the school they too will be retrained for other 
positions in the military she said 
the names of those involved were not immediately released 
this is the largest cheating case uncovered at the police 
academy although authorities have investigated smaller isolated 
cases of cheating in the past they said

the citys public housing agency wants to defuse 
latenight tension in some tough neighborhoods by luring gang 
members into a midnight basketball league 
this is for kids who have been written off said gil walker 
a chicago housing authority authority staff member and commissioner 
of the new league 
from 10 pm until 2 am beginning in january 150 young men 
from 18 to 25 years old will be shooting at baskets 
the idea is to keep the young men especially the gang leaders 
off the streets during a dangerous time and give them extra support 
and leadership in an effort to steer them straight walker said 
wednesday 
this is going to be modeled after the nba uniforms playoffs 
and championships said walker but also just like in the nba 
if somebody has a drug problem were going to provide counseling 
family problems money problems education job training were 
going to help 
the program also was modeled on one in glenarden md just 
outside washington dc 
walker a former semiprofessional basketball player said hes 
not alarmed by the prospect of rival gang members crowding into a 
gym to watch or play 
one thing ive found is that sports transcends gang feuding 
he said ive seen them lay their pistols down play basketball 
then pick up their pistols and leave 
the authority has come up with 50000 half from the federal 
government for startup money and will seek corporate sponsors 
we want to take them away to a resort for three days of 
orientation to tell them exactly what were about walker said 
and its not about winning and losing basketball games but 
about building selfesteem and personal pride he said 
virginia peoples manager of the rockwell gardens housing 
project said she expects the program to be popular 
the image of gang members standing around on the street corner 
uninterested in anything but trouble isnt accurate ms peoples 
said 
some of the kids in gangs have come to us looking for 
employment she said the stereotype isnt totally true

a federal jurys rejection of 
seditious conspiracy charges against three radicals may signal that 
the littleused prosecution tactic will remain that way a 
constitutional scholar said 
others cautioned that the loss may be a setback but wont stop 
future sedition prosecutions 
the nearly yearlong trial of raymond levasseur his wife 
patricia and richard williams ended in a mistrial wednesday after 
the jury deadlocked on whether the threes alleged bombing exploits 
constituted racketeering prosecutors said they may decide friday 
whether to retry the unresolved charges 
on monday the jury issued a partial verdict clearing the three 
on the sedition charges that they plotted to overthrow the 
government 
arthur kinoy a constitutional law expert at rutgers university 
interpreted that as a serious blow to the prosecution tactic of 
filing seditious conspiracy charges 
i think there were defense lawyers definitely watching who 
will use the springfield case as a very strong indication that 
the seditious conspiracy technique has got to be totally 
abandoned kinoy said i think the jury was reacting in a very 
fundamental and positive way to the basic constitutional 
protections of the people of this country in the exercise of their 
first amendment rights 
william m kunstler a defense lawyer who has been active in 
supporting radical causes called the jurys decision a big 
setback for prosecutors adding that it was a deserved one 
because what theyve been doing for a long time is prosecuting 
revolutionary people in a far different way than anybody else than 
murderers thieves and so on 
prosecutors had claimed that the defendants belonged to a band 
of terrorists who conspired to commit bombings and bank robberies 
along the east coast from 1976 to 1984 in a plot to overthrow the 
government 
the seditious conspiracy charges trace their roots to the 
prosecution of confederate spies in the civil war era the sedition 
act of 1918 was used against war protesters in world war i and to 
prosecute puerto rican nationalists in 1950 in april 1988 nine 
white supremacists were acquitted of seditious conspiracy in 
arkansas 
prosecutors wouldnt comment on how they interpreted the 
springfield verdict 
elizabeth fink a member of the defense team said i think 
theyre going to give it up for a while i think we dealt them a 
stunning and complete defeat 
still fink and retired boston university professor howard zinn 
an expert on revolutionary history said they dont expect the 
government to abandon seditious conspiracy 
im not saying theyll use it tomorrow but theyre there as 
handy weapons for them to use whenever they want to repress zinn 
said 
meanwhile us attorney wayne budd was deciding thursday 
whether to try again on the unresolved racketeering charges a 
statement may be made friday spokeswoman susan spurlock said a 
hearing is scheduled jan 5 in boston to formally decide the 
disposition of the case 
jurors had also cleared mrs levasseur of a charge of 
racketeering they deadlocked on two counts of racketeering against 
the two men and counts of racketeering conspiracy against all 
three each count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and 20000 
in fines 
while admitting nothing the defense had said that prosecution 
was pointless since levasseur and williams were already serving 
lengthy sentences for convictions on some of the bombings mrs 
levasseur was free on bail after serving 3 years of a 5year 
sentence for harboring a fugitive her husband 
the indictments were issued in may 1986 and the three defendants 
were all that remained of an original group of eight jury 
selection began in march 1988 and the actual trial began in 
january estimates of the cost ranged from 2 million to 10 
million

the red army faction has gained notoriety as 
one of europes deadliest leftist terrorist groups in two decades 
of bloody attacks on west german and american targets 
prosecutors said the group claimed responsibility for the bomb 
attack thursday morning that killed alfred herrhausen chairman of 
deutsche bank west germanys largest and one of chancellor 
helmut kohls closest economic advisers 
the red army faction which had been relatively inactive the 
past three years began operating in the late 1960s it was known 
then as the baadermeinhof gang named after its founders andreas 
baader and ulrike meinhof 
it gained a reputation as a brutal wellorganized group that 
struck at the heart of west germanys industrial and economic power 
by targeting leading managers for assassinations 
american military targets have also come under red army faction 
attacks in the groups antiimperialist struggle 
most of the original red army faction leaders have been killed 
by police or have died in prison authorities say the group is now 
believed to consist of a core of 20 to 30 members 
the groups first action came in april 1968 with arson attacks 
on two frankfurt department stores 
the group changed its name to the red army faction in 1971 and a 
series of assassinations and bomb attacks followed 
on may 11 1972 five bombs exploded at the us armys 5th 
corps headquarters in frankfurt killing an american officer and 
injuring 13 other people 
on may 25 1972 three us soldiers were killed and five 
injured when a powerful bomb left in a parked car ripped through a 
parking lot at the us armys european headquarters in heidelberg 
the red army faction claimed responsibility 
in april 1975 red army faction terrorists occupied the west 
german embassy in stockholm in an attempt to free imprisoned fellow 
terrorists two diplomats and two terrorists died in an explosion 
during the siege 
the year 1977 is remembered as a particularly bloody period 
when red army faction attacks shook the foundations of west 
germanys society 
that year the group assassinated chief state prosecutor 
siegfried buback kidnapped and killed the head of the employers 
association hannsmartin schleyer and killed juergen ponto head 
of the dresdner bank one of the countys three big banks 
a lufthansa jet was also hijacked to somalia in an attempt to 
force authorities to free jailed red army faction leaders a west 
german commando team stormed the jetliner to end the siege 
a few hours later red army faction leaders baader jancarle 
raspe and gudrun ensslin committed suicide in stuttgarts 
topsecurity prison of stammheim where they were serving life 
sentences meinhof had committed suicide in prison a year earlier 
even with the deaths of the groups most notorious leaders the 
attacks did not cease 
in august 1981 20 people were injured in a carbomb attack on 
the us air force headquarters in ramstein two weeks later us 
gen frederik kroesen commander of us army europe narrowly 
escaped assassination in heidelberg when his car was attacked by 
rockets 
on feb 1 1985 munich industrialist ernst zimmermann was shot 
and killed at his home by two terrorists 
on aug 8 1985 a car bomb killed two us air force personnel 
at the rheinmain air base outside frankfurt and injured 20 others 
a us soldier had been killed a day earlier in wiesbaden and the 
red army faction claimed responsibility for both attacks 
in july 1986 red army faction terrorists killed industrialist 
karl heinz beckurts near munich and in october that year diplomat 
gerold von braunmuehl was shot and killed on a street in bonn 
authorities say about 60 people including terrorists have been 
killed since the red army faction began its terrorist campaign

round black 
markers dotted the huge stone faces of four us presidents 
thursday as a project got under way to develop a longterm 
maintenance plan for mount rushmore 
six national park service employees and workers from an 
engineering firm carefully positioned 60 to 75 of the plastic 
markers on the 60foot granite faces so a photographer in a 
helicopter could take closeup pictures friday of the hundreds of 
cracks that may threaten the structural integrity of the shrine of 
democracy 
the ultimate purpose is so we can actually map those cracks 
and make models of the mountain and then analyze those models to 
determine what potential movement and instability is there said 
dan wenk mount rushmore superintendent 
the black markers 15 inches across or a little bigger than a 
record album will become reference marks in the photographs the 
markers should be removed friday afternoon wenk said 
bob crisman of the national park service who was suspended by a 
cable in front of the faces stuck the markers on with an adhesive 
a ground crew of surveyors was in radio contact from the mount 
rushmore visitors center telling him where to place the markers 
each fall workers seal cracks in the faces with a mixture of 
granite dust white lead and linseed oil to keep out water that 
would freeze and to lessen the damage when cool weather makes the 
rock contract 
it was decided two years ago that a comprehensive examination of 
the popular tourist attraction and a maintenance plan was needed 
wenk said 
monthly measurements since 1980 of a prominent crack on the 
forehead of george washingtons likeness indicated the potential 
instability of the fissure he said a scientist projected that the 
crack would widen onequarter of an inch every 200 years wenk said 
there has been no discernable damage to the memorial to date 
and this will allow us to make certain we can preserve it he 
said 
wenk said the project actually started in september when aerial 
photographs were taken 
something thats carved in stone has the impression of lasting 
forever he said its been 62 years since the carving first 
began its a blink of an eye in geologic time 
what we know for sure right now is that the mountain is still 
in the same shape it was when it was completed 
a structural analysis of the portraits of presidents washington 
thomas jefferson abraham lincoln and theodore roosevelt drilled 
and blasted into a mountainside in the black hills should be done 
by next fall wenk said 
they are largest carved figures anywhere washingtons face is 
as high as a fivestory building bigger than any sphinx in egypt 
and the monument can be seen for 60 miles 
wenk said the estimated 350000 cost of the project will be 
paid by the private mount rushmore national memorial society the 
nonprofit group has served as a benefactor to the monument since 
1930 
work on mount rushmore began in 1927 by sculptor gutzon borglum 
and was finished in 1941 by his son lincoln the black hills 
memorial attracts about 2 million visitors a year 
the monument was the scene of a climactic final battle in 
north by northwest alfred hitchcocks classic 1959 thriller 
starring cary grant 
a golden anniversary celebration is being planned for 1991 
mount rushmore never has been officially dedicated and wenk said 
it is hoped president bush will agree to do the honors for the 50th 
anniversary

the government said thursday it 
will tear down the fences on its border with austria and lift 
virtually all restrictions on travel to the west 
the communist party held its first talks with the opposition 
and members of parliament proposed the repeal of tough laws used to 
imprison and fine dissenters 
the party also said it would announce a new program to include 
an objective revision of its attitude toward the prague 
spring reform movement of 1968 and the sovietled invasion that 
crushed it 
spokesman josef hora said the new policies might allow for 
readmission to the party of half a million people expelled after 
the invasion they include alexander dubcek who was communist 
party chief and led the reforms 
hora said two politburo members met for the first time with the 
opposition civic forum group and students who led 11 days of mass 
protest that toppled the old party leadership 
he said the meeting occurred because we are just one of the 
political parties in this country and we have to find our place 
civic forum previously had met only with premier ladislav adamec 
and other government officials 
state radio began broadcasting twicedaily programs about civic 
forum activities and also featured music by singers who had been 
banned for years 
government spokesman marcel jansen said the interior ministry 
would begin the removal of technical equipment on the frontier 
with neutral austria which bristles with barbed wire watchtowers 
and trip wires 
he did not say whether similar action would be taken on the 
long fortified border with west germany 
hungary started tearing down its border barriers with austria in 
may and tens of thousands of east germans fled across the frontier 
to the west before the east german government abolished travel 
restrictions 
the interior ministry said that starting monday citizens will 
be allowed to use their passports for unrestricted travel to the 
west and all east bloc countries except the soviet union and 
poland the state news agency ctk reported 
the only remaining formality will be completion of a simple 
statistical card to be filled out as people leave the country 
ctk said 
the government had announced nov 14 that its citizens would be 
able to go to the west and yugoslavia a popular vacation spot 
beginning jan 1 without waiting 30 days for an exit visa 
ctk said six political prisoners were released and that 
president gustav husak granted amnesty to stanislav devaty a 
former spokesman for the charter 77 human rights group who went 
underground weeks ago and another activist 
state radio said marxismleninism was being abolished as a 
compulsory subject at universities meeting a demand from students 
and faculty members would be hired on the basis of professional 
qualifications rather than communist party membership 
economist valtr komarek a reformminded communist some 
opposition leaders see as a possible premier cautioned against too 
much compromise in negotiations for reform with adamec 
he spoke one day after parliament removed provisions from the 
constitution that guarantee the communists a monopoly on power 
whatever the change in its constitutional status the party has 
17 million members and controls the official media police armed 
forces and appointments in every operation from factories to 
village schools 
the structure of power remains intact komarek said it is 
only the facade which has collapsed and the structure of power has 
receded into the background 
too many compromises are made too much is spoken too little 
is done relapses are still possible 
the order to remove the fences reflected the new foreign policy 
adamec said he seeks to implement 
he has said he will choose a new government by sunday that 
includes noncommunists members of civic forum could be among them 
adamec said thursday he would accept opposition suggestions on 
who should serve in the new government 
civic forum spokesman jiri dienstbier said wednesday night the 
opposition wanted a civilian communist to run the defense ministry 
and a noncommunist to oversee police forces at the interior 
ministry 
in a television address wednesday night adamec appeared to 
promote himself as a figure of consensus to czechoslovakias 155 
million citizens 
he called for a reassessment of the 1968 warsaw pact invasion 
and pledged to negotiate withdrawal of the 80000 soviet soldiers 
stationed in czechoslovakia ever since 
the soviet forces were seen as legitimizing party chief milos 
jakes and other czechoslovak leaders installed by moscow after the 
august invasion but those men now have been ousted 
adamec said a soviet withdrawal could occur only in an 
alleuropean framework 
ctk said members of parliament had suggested repeal of the 
public order laws used to impose stiff fines or jail terms on 
antigovernment protesters 
the agency said the deputies whom it did not identify planned 
to submit that proposal and other legal measures to shorten 
pretrial custody to a maximum of two months and remove the offense 
of abusing a religious function which has been used against 
priests 
priests must be licensed in czechoslovakia and many have had to 
go underground after being barred from office by authorities 
deputies also want the independence of courts spelled out in a 
new consitution and seek laws to punish those who damage the 
environment ctk reported 
nearly onethird of the nations forests have been destroyed by 
acid rain and other pollution and both air and water are badly 
polluted in prague and several other cities

a chartered jet carrying 130 vietnamese who 
volunteered to return to the communist homeland they fled flew for 
hanoi on thursday amid signs that many more boat people may soon be 
repatriated against their will 
the sixth and largest batch of vietnamese to voluntarily return 
home included nine babies who were born in hong kong the total 
number to return home since the first flight in march is 637 
the voluntary repatriation program which is sponsored by the 
united nations high commissioner for refugees has only attracted a 
small fraction of the nearly 57000 vietnamese languishing in hong 
kong where they are seeking asylum after fleeing their homeland by 
boat 
about 44000 of the vietnamese arrived after june 1988 when 
hong kong adopted a policy that treats all arriving boat people as 
illegal immigrants subject to repatriation unless they can prove 
they fled political or religious persecution 
boat people denied refugee status may soon be sent back to 
vietnam forcibly british foreign minister francis maude said the 
program of mandatory repatriation will start before the next 
sailing season begins in february or march

a businessman whose financial 
relationship with former us house speaker jim wright was 
investigated by a congressional ethics committee has filed for 
protection under federal bankruptcy law 
fort worth developer george mallick listed debts of 122 
million and assets of 533626 in the petition filed wednesday in 
us bankruptcy court 
mallick and his wife marlene filed under chapter 7 provisions 
of the us bankruptcy code which allow a debtors unprotected 
assets to be liquidated to pay creditors 
mallicks 500000 home and 30000 worth of personal 
possessions are exempt from seizure said mallicks attorney henry 
simon jr 
with those exemptions the 177 creditors listed in the 
bankruptcy filing are likely to receive virtually nothing 
mallick told the fort worth startelegram 
mallick 55 said the texas oil and real estate busts took his 
fortune just like those of the hunt brothers and former gov john 
connally my economic fate was set as was everybody elses when 
oil prices went to 10 in 1986 we all got caught he said 
mallick estimated his net worth peaked at 7 million in 1982 
although he has focused on real estate he also once had oil 
holdings worth about 15 million 
more than 80 percent of mallicks debt is in three large loans 
for real estate developments including 62 million owed to ncnb 
texas for financing on a 10 million office tower in fort worth 
mallick is one of wrights closest friends the longtime 
congressman from fort worth resigned in june after a house ethics 
committee said he committed 69 ethics violations most involving 
business and book deals 
among other issues the committee questioned wrights business 
dealings with mallick in a partnership called mallightco 
the committee said there was reason to believe that wright 
had improperly accepted nearly 145000 in gifts from mallick and 
failed to report them 
most of the money came from an 18000 annual salary to the 
speakers wife betty over four years it also included use of a 
car a condominium and an apartment 
at the time mallick denied the partnership was a device to 
funnel money to wright and said mrs wright had earned her pay 
this week mallick said his chapter 7 filing does not involve 
wright mrs wright or mallightco which is now controlled by one 
of mallicks daughters

with soviet president gorbachev the lawmakers said they would 
welcome some clarification about us policy toward cambodia 
the civil war there is one of several regional conflicts to be 
addressed at the summit 
the khmer rouge blamed for the deaths of more than a million 
cambodians during its rule of the country in the 1970s is the 
strongest of the factions engaged in a civil war against the phnom 
penh government 
the united states is supporting other noncommunist rebel 
groups as cambodias future leaders but baker reportedly has 
explored giving the khmer rouge a minimal role in a transitional 
government to break a diplomatic deadlock there 
we are concerned that any us effort directly or indirectly 
to promote a powersharing role for the khmer rouge no matter how 
minimal would represent an implicit legitimization of a movement 
the world finds abhorrent and would constitute a profound shift in 
our policy stated the letter circulated by rep chet atkins 
dmass 
the letter was signed by members of the house and senate 
leadership and numerous committee chairmen and included house 
majority leader richard gephardt dmo and senate majority whip

the first nationwide scientific survey for 
hepatitis b infection shows the infectious liver disease is four 
times as common among blacks as whites the national centers for 
disease control reported thursday 
in a survey of more than 14000 people over five years 48 
percent showed signs in blood tests of having been infected with 
hepatitis b virus some time during their lives among blacks 137 
percent tested positive compared with 32 percent among whites 
previous studies including checks of blood samples given by 
blood donors have pointed to an increased hepatitis b rate among 
blacks but this study is the first among a statistically 
representative sample of people in the united states said dr 
miriam alter a cdc hepatitis specialist 
the survey was conducted in the years 19761980 by the cdcs 
national center for health statistics but the results were 
reported thursday for the first time the cdc gave no explanation 
for the delay 
blacks increased likelihood of getting hepatitis b sometime 
during their lives was especially evident in test results for 
people 6574 in that age group 396 percent of blacks had had 
hepatitis b infections compared with 69 percent of whites 
hepatitis b is transmitted in ways somewhat similar to aids 
through sexual intercourse or direct contact with blood infections 
can cause inflammation of the liver jaundice and flulike 
symptoms the disease can be prevented by a vaccine developed in 
1982 
researchers believe as many as half the people infected with 
hepatitis b never suffer severe symptoms and never know they are 
infected 
the cdc did not speculate on reasons for the increased 
prevalence of hepatitis b among blacks but the atlantabased 
agency did say that the traditional targets for hepatitis b 
vaccinations health workers who handle blood dialysis patients 
and some institutionalized people may be the wrong targets 
given the high prevalence of hepatitis b infections among blacks 
and a trend toward infection during adolescence immunization of 
the traditionally targeted risk groups will not markedly affect the 
spread of infection in the united states the cdc said 
immunization programs need to include adolescents and young 
adults the agency said 
the cdc noted that survey findings showing higher rates of 
active infection for people in the 1224 age group compared with 
children under 11 
twenty thousand hepatitis b cases have been reported in the 
united states this year many cases go unreported

the premier of slovenia on thursday 
challenged the need for a yugoslav state to exist at all following 
a decision by serbia yugoslavias largest republic to sever ties 
with his northern state 
the latest events give rise to the question of the sense of 
our further joint existence dusan sinigoj said in a statement 
carried by the official tanjug news agency 
without democracy human rights and yugoslavias 
inclusion in the integrative processes in europe we cannot develop 
into a democratic and efficient community of nationalities 
communist yugoslavia is a loose federation of six republics and 
two autonomous provinces with many nationalities and differing 
ethnic populations the regions have grown increasingly restive 
since the death in 1980 of josip tito founder of the modern 
yugoslav state in 1945 
titos charisma was credited as a major force in binding 
yugoslavia together and submerging the regional tensions that 
surfaced after his death 
liberal and prosperous slovenia where multiparty democracy is 
being established and the serbian leadership which advocates 
continued communist rule and a strongly centralized federal system 
have a history of disputes 
yugoslav politicians and news media were deeply divided over 
serbias decision announced wednesday to break off all government 
and business contacts with slovenia 
some western diplomats described serbias move as a possible 
first step toward disintegration of the fractious yugoslav 
federation 
serbia acted after slovenia banned a mass protest rally by serb 
nationalists in ljubljana the slovene capital 
the demonstration orchestrated by the serbian government was 
scheduled for friday in an apparent attempt by serbias 
conservative communist politicians to topple slovenias reformist 
leadership 
sinigoj said that threats of destructive marches the fanning 
of nationalist passions and demands for replacement of legally 
elected officials cannot achieve the democratization of 
yugoslavia 
the instigators of such actions must be stopped 
serbias break in relations appears to be the culmination of a 
long campaign against slovenia and of its repeated informal 
attempts to achieve an economic boycott on that republic 
slovenian politicians believe serbian leaders want to impose 
their ideological orthodoxy on all of yugoslavia 
serbs from southern kosovo province who were to have 
spearheaded the rally denounced the ban as fascistlike 
serbian officials elsewhere called it a brutal antiserbian 
and antiyugoslav act of slovenias ruling clique 
but a radio report in croatia another northern region that has 
supported slovenias reforms said slovenia has demonstrated how 
a state based on the rule of law should function and therefore it 
is extremely cynical to accuse it of fascism 
croatias influential vjesnik newspaper wrote that serbias 
diabolic plan has been thwarted by the decisiveness and 
firmness of the slovene leadership with the support of the vast 
majority of yugoslavias citizens 
police checked vehicles thursday to stop serbians from reaching 
ljubljana 
the slovene capital was virtually deserted most residents went 
to nearby alpine resorts for a twoday holiday marking the 46th 
anniversary of the establishment of yugoslavia as a communist state

state sen ben bagert a veteran 
legislator who switched to the republican party in february 
announced thursday he will challenge incumbent democrat j bennett 
johnston for the us senate next year 
bagert of new orleans is the second republican candidate to 
join the race against johnston who is seeking his fourth term in 
1990 secretary of state fox mckeithen who switched this year to 
the gop announced his bid last month 
bagert said in making his announcement that johnston had not 
put louisianas interests first 
senators we send to congress seem to get so wrapped up with 
the strange world of washington they lose touch with the people 
who sent them bagert said and nowhere in this country is a 
senator more a stranger to his home state than j bennett johnston 
is to louisiana 
bagert described himself as a conservative reformer and 
supporter of lower taxes cutting government spending and tough 
drug laws and environmental legislation 
bagert also criticized johnston chairman of the senate energy 
committee for working for a bill to build pipelines to transport 
coal slurry coal mixed with water to make it easy to move by 
pipeline instead of lines for louisiana natural gas 
tony garrett a spokesman for johnston responded that the coal 
slurry pipelines were designed to export coal and louisiana ports 
could benefit 
he added that johnston was not available to comment directly 
because he was on a tour of the state proving that he was not out 
of touch with the people

beginning friday california shoppers 
have to dig onequarter of one percent deeper into their 
pocketbooks to help pay for earthquake relief 
the quartercentperdollar sales tax increase was approved in 
the legislatures november special session and lasts until dec 31 
1990 
the extra revenue is expected to total 800 million over the 
next 13 months the extra tax was timed to take advantage of the 
two yearend holiday retail sales surges 
most of the money it raises will help pay for rebuilding roads 
bridges and public buildings damaged in the earthquake that struck 
the san francisco area oct 17 
for most counties in the state the new sales and use tax rate 
will be 625 percent 
however voters in 13 counties including los angeles 
sacramento and san francisco had previously approved halfcent 
sales tax increases so their new rate is 675 percent five 
counties including san diego have had two such local increases 
so their rate is 725 percent 
the legislature agreed to the tax increase in a special session 
called by gov george deukmejian rejecting arguments from some 
legislators that state surplus funds instead of a tax increase 
should go to quake relief and arguments from the other side that 
the quartercent hike was not enough

new president elias hrawi vowed thursday 
to recover the presidential palace and other government 
institutions from a defiant christian gen michel aoun but said he 
would try to avoid bloodshed 
he spoke at a news conference as hundreds of syrian army trucks 
carried supplies to frontline positions in south beirut and in 
mountains east and northeast of the capital 
the syrian troops are in combat formations their command is 
supplying them with ammunition enough to last for quite a long 
time according to a military source in moslem west beirut 
preparations for a final showdown to oust aoun from the 
presidential palace in suburban baabda have been afoot all week 
syrian troops and armor began rolling in monday strengthening 
forces along the front lines after aoun rejected hrawis election 
nov 24 and subsequent presidential decrees dismissing the general 
as army commander and disbanding his interim military cabinet 
israel radio reported aoun has requested military support from 
the commander of israels surrogate militia in south lebanon gen 
antoine lahd but that israel rejected the appeal 
lahd commands the israelibacked 2500man south lebanon army 
militia which patrols a buffer zone israel maintains in lebanon 
ostensibly to protect its northern border against guerrilla attacks 
aoun aides had no immediate comment on the report 
i will resort to all possible means to regain the state 
institutions from those who control them hrawi a maronite 
catholic said at the news conference in ablah an army barracks in 
the syrianpoliced bekaa valley 
hrawi moved to an officers residence at the ablah barracks 
wednesday pending settlement of the dispute over the presidential 
palace 
hrawi accused aoun also a maronite of partitioning 
lebanon adding that he has hope in our armed forces to reunite 
the nation 
i dont want bloodshed either in christian east beirut or 
in west beirut ill use all possible means to reunite the 
country he said 
he urged all 42000 lebanese army soldiers to be at the 
disposal of your new commander adm emile lahoud who was 
appointed tuesday to replace aoun as army commander about 20000 
soldiers remain loyal to aoun and the others mainly moslem units 
have accepted lahoud as commander 
addressing aoun and his supporters hrawi said you have 
killed the president of the republic and attacked the residences 
and property of parliamentary deputies these attacks will not go 
unpunished 
hrawis predecessor president rene mouawad was killed by a bomb 
in west beirut on nov 22 17 days after his election 
syria and its allies blamed aoun for the killing but he denied 
the charge 
the homes of at least six christian parliamentarians were 
destroyed by bombs in the christian enclave after parliament 
approved a peace plan to end 14 years of civil war at a special 
session in the saudi arabian resort taif in october 
aoun rejected the accord because it did include a timetable for 
a syrian troop withdrawal 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said the united states has contacted the lebanese government key 
european allies arab friends the soviet union and syria to 
express support for hrawi and our wish that the process of 
reconciliation continue through peaceful means 
she also said thursday that us officials believe aoun should 
step aside in favor of lebanons constitutionally sanctioned 
government 
syria has 40000 troops controlling 70 percent of lebanese 
territory they moved in under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping 
mandate but later became the moslems main backers 
aoun fought the syrians for six months this year an arab league 
ceasefire halted hostilities in september 
hrawi said lebanons interest would best be preserved by 
implementing the taif accord which mainly redistributes power 
equally between christians and moslems 
france the christians main protector on thursday ordered the 
amphibious troop ship orace to sail from toulon toward lebanon to 
be ready to evacuate french nationals should the security situation 
deteriorate there are 6000 french nationals in lebanon many of 
them lebanese with dual nationality 
prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem said france has 
contradicting policies toward lebanon 
on the one hand france declares support for the legitimate 
lebanese authorities and on the other it does not miss a chance to 
show its muscles in the face of the legitimate authorities he 
said 
france had supported hrawis election and backed the arab 
leaguebrokered taif accord but 33 rightwing french 
parliamentarins visited lebanon on wednesday and declared support 
for aoun 
in israel cabinet minister roni milo said israel was carefully 
following developments in lebanon after syrian troop buildups 
against aoun the past few days 
a moslem government official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the next 48 hours will be decisive they will 
determine whether aoun will be dealt with politically or 
militarily

the terrorist red army faction 
dormant for three years killed west germanys most powerful banker 
thursday by blowing apart his armored mercedes with a 
lightsensitive bomb on a bicycle 
alfred herrhausen was chairman of deutsche bank west germanys 
largest and one of chancellor helmut kohls chief economic 
advisers 
police said the the bicyclebomb apparently was placed on a 
street of this spa town outside frankfurt where the 59yearold 
banker lived and detonated by a sophisticated lightbeam device as 
he drove by on his way to work 
they said it was the first time terrorists used such a detonator 
in west german 
federal criminal police offered a reward of up to 22 million 
one of the largest here ever 
police with helicopters were searching for two men seen leaving 
the area a stolen white lancia believed to have been used in the 
getaway was found abandoned in a frankfurt suburb 
for a long time the deutsche bank and herrhausen in 
particular have been targeted by the red army faction said 
hansjuergen foerster spokesman for the chief federal prosecutors 
office he said the ultraleftists accuse deutsche bank of financing 
a worldwide militaryindustrial complex 
the explosion heard three miles away turned herrhausens 
armored limousine into a heap of twisted metal and blew out windows 
in buildings 
his driver jakob nix was seriously injured but police said 
his condition was not critical security agents following in 
another car were unhurt 
a letter found at the scene claimed responsibility on behalf of 
the red army faction west germanys deadliest terrorist group of 
which little had been heard since 1986 
foerster said the letter was not typical of red army faction 
claims because it did not explain motives after previous attacks 
the terrorist group left lengthy statements giving detailed reasons 
for the actions 
he said the letter was signed commando wolfgang beer for a 
suspect in an investigation of the red army faction and carried 
faction symbols a starshaped symbol and a drawing of a 
kalashnikov assault rifle 
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble who is in charge of police 
and security issues said protection for prominent figures was 
stepped up after a red army faction hunger strike that ended last 
april 
during the fast one imprisoned terrorist called for increasing 
activities with all means 
schaeuble told zdf tv that since then red army faction 
followers are believed operating with more autonomy than before 
when they were guided by a tightknit structure 
chancellor kohl his eyes filled with tears and his voice 
breaking condemned the cowardly and brutal murder of his 
personal friend 
parliament interrupted debate for five minutes in honor of 
herrhausen 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said we deplore this terrorist act and stand ready to assist 
in any way that we can 
herrhausen the bestknown figure in west german business often 
advised kohl and frequently accompanied him on trips abroad the 
tall striking financier had led deutsche bank on an aggressive 
expansion aimed at putting it among the worlds top 10 or 15 banks 
he urged more investment in the soviet union and other parts of 
eastern europe most recently he recommended west german 
investment in east germany 
deutsche bank owns large interests in many leading west german 
companies including daimlerbenz the largest conglomerate 
herrhausen arranged the biggest industrial restructuring in west 
german history the merger of daimlerbenz with aerospace giant 
messerschmittboelkowblohm 
the bank under herrhausen had been preparing for a leading role 
as the common market moves toward a barrierfree internal market of 
1992 
the banks efforts to gain a stake in investment banking 
culminated this week in the 640 million takeover bid for the 
british investment bank morgan grenfell group plc 
the banker sat on many company boards and last year became the 
sole chairman of deutsche bank which he joined in 1969 
the red army faction was born in the 1960s and has a long 
history of attacks on west german business and political figures 
as well as us military targets 
its last known operations were the murders in 1986 of karl heinz 
beckurts of the giant siemens industrial concern and diplomat 
gerold von braunmuehl the red army faction was believed connected 
with an unsuccessful attempt on the life of finance ministry 
official hans tietmeyer in september 1988 
heinrich boge head of the federal criminal investigations 
office said there were never any signs that they had given up 
so we were constantly warning against people writing them off too 
quickly 
the red army faction is believed to have 20 to 30 hardcore 
members aided by dozens of sympathizers most of its original 
leaders have been killed by police committed suicide in prison or 
are serving long prison sentences 
herrhausens wife and two daughters survive

the environmental protection agency proposed 
tigher pollution controls thursday on hundreds of municipal waste 
incinerators including a requirement that at least onefourth of 
all reusable garbage be recycled 
although the epa said the tigher standards would curtail 
incinerator emissions by 90 percent within five years the proposal 
was attacked immediately by environmentalists who said the agency 
should require greater recycling 
the proposal is the first attempt by the federal government to 
impose a nationwide standard on toxic chemical releases from 
garbage incineration plants although many communities already have 
curbs some as stringent as those proposed by the epa 
there are more than 450 garbage incinerators nationwide with 150 
more expected to be built over the next five years as 
municipalities increasingly turn to burning garbage as landfill 
space becomes scarce 
this proposal will assure that municipal waste incinerators 
employ the best demonstrated technology to protect public health 
and the environment by reducing air emissions and toxic ash said 
william rosenberg the assistant epa administrator for air and 
radiation 
rosenberg said a final regulation is expected to be issued 
within a year 
federal regulations currently place restrictions only on dust 
emissions from the burning of garbage although many states and 
localities have toxic pollution controls as well 
the additional pollution control equipment was estimated to 
amount to an added cost of about 20 a year for every household 
served by a garbage incineration plant epa officials said 
many environmentalists have accused the epa of putting too much 
emphasis on incineration in dealing with the mounting garbage 
problem and not giving enough attention to recycling they argue 
that even with the tighter controls some unhealthy levels of toxic 
air emissions will persist and the disposal of toxic ash will 
continue to pose a threat to groundwater and soil when it is buried 
arguing that as much as 80 percent of the garbage can be 
recycled consumer activist ralph nader called the epas 25 percent 
target a token recycling effort designed to provide a cloak 
of environmental legitimacy for incineration programs nader said 
all burning of municipal garbage should be banned 
the 25 percent goal will not even begin to solve the garbage 
crisis added larry shapiro of the new york public interest 
research group another environmental organization that has 
campaigned against gargage burning 
allen hershkowitz an expert on solid waste issues for the 
natural resources defense council called the epa proposal a 
positive first step but said its recycling requirement is far 
too modest 
rosenberg said that while the epa proposed the 25 percent 
recycling target the agency has not ruled out the possiblity that 
the percentage will be increased when a final regulation is issued 
the epa proposal calls for air emission standards for both 
existing incinerators and for ones still on the drawing board 
it would require incinerator operators to install scrubbers and 
other technology that would reduce emissions of toxic metals such 
as lead cadmium mercury arsenic and chromium by as much as 99 
percent organic chemicals such as dioxins and furans by 99 
percent and acid gases such as sulfur dioxide and hydrogen 
chlordie by 90 to 95 percent 
the agency also would require tighter operating standards to 
ensure optimum combustion to reduce pollution and prohibit the 
burning of leadacid batteries which are the source of an 
estimated 60 percent of the lead emissions and residues coming from 
incinerators

the national institutes of health is 
investigating procedures used in a study that helps set national 
air pollution standards amid allegations thata harvard professor 
ignored errors in the research the university said thursday 
the nih inquiry concerns the six cities study which has 
been conducted at harvard since 1974 to monitor the effects of air 
pollution said harvard spokesman peter costa 
armando garsd a former statistician at harvard told the wall 
street journal that he was dismissed from a research post in 1986 
after he disclosed errors in the study to john spengler one of the 
professors working on the project 
the us environmental protection agency uses the information to 
set national air emission standards 
they are checking some of the procedures and the data 
collection costa said 
the action is the latest in a series of incidents that have 
raised questions about research integrity at harvard and other 
academic institutions last year a harvard medical school 
professor was forced to resign because of charges of plagiarism 
spengler was out of town thursday and could not be reached for 
comment but costa reading from a statement said we have 
absolutely no reason to believe that there is any evidence of 
scientific misconduct we have every reason to believe that 
malevolence has led to the repetition of frivolous allegations 
costa said the nih inquiry apparently grew from the original 
allegations by garsd which he attributed to ill feeling from 
the exemployee 
suzanne hadley acting director of the nihs office of 
scientific integrity in washington said she could neither confirm 
nor deny the existence of an inquiry 
speaking in general terms however she said an inquiry is a 
factfinding process in which officials determine if a formal 
investigation should be conducted into allegations of scientific 
misconduct 
garsd who has sued harvard in a state court for alleged 
wrongful dismissal now works for the food and drug administration 
in washington he declined to comment on the case thursday 
but garsd told the harvard crimson in november 1988 that he sent 
several memos to spengler one of the professors working on the 
project but received no response 
and in a previous interview with the wall street journal garsd 
said he found errors including mistakes already published in

a police officer who shot a black motorcyclist 
testified in his own defense thursday telling jurors he fired only 
because he thought he was about to die 
he just came straight at me and he just revved the 
motorcycle officer william lozano 31 testified he was just 
aiming at me i was just only able to turn my body draw my gun and 
shoot 
the testimony was broadcast live on television and radio in 
miami where three days of racial violence broke out following the 
jan 16 shooting cable news network carried lozanos testimony 
live nationally 
twice before in this decade innocent verdicts favoring 
policemen accused of killing blacks have led to rioting and the 
miami and metrodade police forces are on alert for renewed 
violence 
prosecution witnesses testified that the hispanic officer who 
faces two counts of manslaughter in the deaths of the motorcyclist 
and a passenger coolly took aim and fired as the bike was about to 
speed past him while being pursued by a police car 
the defense was expected to put on one more technical witness 
friday after which rebuttal witnesses were scheduled court 
officials have not said when they expect the case to go to the jury 
lozano told the court he did not see the motorcycle until the 
last second because his attention was on the lights of the 
approaching squad car he said he spotted the bike only after it 
crossed into the traffic lane where he stood 
lozanos attorney roy black asked how close the motorcycle came 
so close that i thought i might die that i was going to be 
run over and i was going to die the colombianborn officer said 
with a light spanish accent i feared for my life 
lozano who has served with the department for five years 
described how the situation quickly degenerated as an angry crowd 
gathered around the two victims the bullet struck the driver 
clement lloyd 23 in the head killing him instantly lloyds 
passenger allan blanchard 24 died the next day of head injuries 
suffered in the subsequent crash 
i was a target for every person there lozano testified 
saying he was getting hit right and left by rocks and bottles 
at one point 
on crossexamination prosecutors picked away at lozanos 
testimony that he did not see the oncoming motorcycle until just 
before he drew and fired 
assistant state attorney john hogan pointed to testimony from 
two officers who interviewed lozano just after the incident they 
said he told them he entered the street because he became aware 
a police car was chasing a motorcycle 
i dont recall lozano answered repeatedly when asked if he 
had given different versions of the shooting to his supervisor and 
a homicide detective he flatly denied some of their accounts 
which stated he had even acted out the shooting 
hogan ridiculed lozanos testimony about his awareness of the 
motorcycle by pointing to other witnesses including the officers 
partner dawn campbell who said they heard a motorcyle speeding 
loudly up the street 
no i did not hear the motorcycle lozano insisted i 
never heard it coming 
the prosecution had shown photos of lozano and ms campbell 
together earlier in the trial to suggest they had concocted the 
story that the motorcycle almost hit him lozano testified the 
photos were taken at the scene of a minor accident that occurred 
after the shooting and said he and ms campbell had never 
discussed the shooting 
you asked dawn campbell to lie for you that night didnt 
you hogan challenged 
no i never spoke to dawn campbell that night lozano said 
adding not about lying 
expert defense witnesses have attempted to counter testimony for 
the prosecution that lozano violated miami police policy when he 
failed to step out of the roadway and then fired at a moving 
vehicle 
when the case opened oct 23 the defense attempted 
unsuccessfully to move the trial arguing that miami juries will be 
too worried about renewed violence to acquit lozano the defense 
also lost a battle to challenge a black juror 
the final sixmember jury consists of two blacks one hispanic 
and three nonhispanic white jurors as well as two hispanic and 
two nonhispanic white alternates

the jury that convicted rep donald lukens 
for having sex with an underage girl should have been allowed to 
review her school and juvenile records the congressmans attorney 
told an appeals court thursday 
the prosecution contended that the girls past was irrelevant to 
the case against the 58yearold republican 
after hearing 40 minutes of argument in lukens bid to overturn 
the conviction a threejudge panel of the 10th ohio district court 
of appeals took the case under advisement it could take several 
months for the court to rule 
lukens was convicted may 26 in franklin county domestic 
relations court on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the 
unruliness of rosie coffman she testified that in november 1988 
when she was 16 lukens paid her to have sex with him at his 
columbus apartment 
judge ronald solove would not let lukens attorney thomas 
tyack introduce ms coffmans school and juvenile records into 
evidence at the trial 
tyack said he has not seen the girls juvenile record but it 
would have given the court a chance to determine ms coffmans 
credibility and motive he said her school records show she had a 
tendency to fantasize often defied authority and had exhibited 
psychological problems 
he also argued that soloves instacross the three branches of the 
federal government and not unreasonably restrictive so as to 
discourage able citizens from entering public service

the state department denied on thursday that 
the crash of a cia plane in angola indicated the united states was 
acting like the nicaraguan government it has accused of helping 
leftist rebels in el salvador 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler refused to confirm 
publicly as other officials have said privately that the plane 
was on a covert cia mission to resupply angolan rebels 
however she responded to suggestions at a news briefing of a 
parallel between the crash and a similar incident over the weekend 
involving equipment that us and salvadoran officials say had been 
earmarked by nicaragua for leftist rebels in el salvador 
i would point out to you the fact that there is a regional 
peace agreement signed by nicaragua committing the signatories not 
to support subversion of neighboring countries the nicaraguans are 
clearly violating this obligation she said 
this was a reference to the twinengined cessna that went down 
last saturday in el salvador while carrying surfacetoair missiles 
and other equipment the salvadoran government and the state 
department charged that the plane originated in nicaragua but 
sandinista authorities denied that 
on wednesday us officials said an l100 cargo plane flying 
from a military base in zaire crashed while carrying supplies to 
rebels fighting angolas leftist government 
they said a huge fireball was created on impact suggesting that 
the plane was carrying large quantities of weapons 
the state department said all four americans on board are 
believed to have died the plane crashed not far from the unita 
rebel headquarters in southeastern angola 
the angolan government issued a statement wednesday confirming 
the crash but gave no new details us officials noting that the 
crash took place in rebelheld territory said it was doubtful the 
angolan government had any independent information about the 
incident 
the chairman of the house foreign affairs africa subcommittee 
rep howard wolpe dmich said he hoped the crash and its 
wholly unnecessary loss of lives would prompt the bush 
administration to reconsider its policy of supplying weapons to 
unita 
covert us support for the war runs counter to our diplomatic 
efforts in the region and undermines the credibility of both the 
united states and zaire when they seek peaceful solutions to the 
conflict wolpe said 
improving ussoviet relations have provided new opportunities 
for diplomacy around the world wolpe noted but he added i 
dont think our policy in angola has caught up with the changing 
dynamic 
the angolan statement used the occasion of the crash to accuse 
unita of showing no interest in a peaceful settlement to their 
14year old conflict 
the statement said that the countrys roman catholic bishops had 
indicated support for the unita position by calling for a 
ceasefire and free elections but that the plane incident showed 
who really wanted peace in angola 
the bush administration also has been an advocate of free 
elections as the best hope for a peaceful outcome in angola 
us officials said that president bush in his discussions with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev this weekend is expected to 
press for that option rather than engage in debate over aid levels 
to the opposing factions in angola 
according to some estimates the soviets have been providing 
800 million a year to the angolans while us assistance for the 
rebel forces is said to be in the 40 million to 50 million range

the solar maximum satellite lost about 20 
miles altitude in a 24hour period thursday prompting the us 
space command to predict that it will fall to earth about 1045 
pm est on friday 
most of the satellite will burn up in the atmosphere but up to a 
dozen larger pieces weighing up to 100 pounds may survive 
officials werent ready to say in what part of the satellites 
track they might come to earth 
we cant predict because there is about a sixhour margin of 
error in our calculations said capt thomas niemann spokesman 
for the space command thats four orbits of earth 
more than 80 percent of the satellites path is over water and 
the chances of debris hitting anyone are considered remote the 
only parts of the united states under solar maxs ground track are 
south florida and the extreme southern parts of texas and hawaii 
solar max which has been studying the sun for nearly 10 years 
exhausted its positioning fuel recently and has been tumbling its 
electricityproducing solar panels and antenna were jettisoned by 
radioed command late last week 
on thursday solar max was orbiting the globe every 884 
minutes when that period is down to 875 minutes the satellite 
will be near enough to be slowed by the thickening atmosphere and 
pulled in by gravity

cocaine addicts are in danger of suffering 
heart attacks even for a few weeks after they stop taking the drug 
a group of los angeles researchers reported 
researchers from the west los angeles veterans administration 
and ucla report that the effects of cocaine may linger after 
withdrawal altering the balance of chemicals in the brain that 
direct the cardiovascular system 
other scientists studying how cocaine affects the heart said the 
report offers compelling evidence of the risk of heart attacks 
and may have implications for drug treatment 
the report appears in the philadelphiabased journal annals of 
internal medicine in the issue being published friday 
young abusers often experience fatal heart attacks while using 
cocaine the 1986 deaths of university of maryland basketball star 
len bias and cleveland browns football player don rogers were both 
ascribed to cocaineinduced heart failure 
but the los angeles study which measured the heart function of 
21 men who were in a substance abuse treatment program discovered 
that addicts may experience abnormal heart activity for as long as 
four weeks after quitting cocaine 
the reports lead author dr koonlawee nademanee of the va 
medical center warned that the first few weeks after withdrawal 
are crucial 
i feel that during withdrawal patients should be carefully 
monitored the most important thing is to make sure the patient is 
completely abstinent from the drug he said 
the researchers found that eight of the 21 subjects had episodes 
of abnormal blood flow to the heart they speculated that cocaine 
had upset the balance of chemicals in the brain that prevent the 
arteries from undergoing spasms making heart attacks more likely 
a heart attack causes the death of part of the heart muscle it 
occurs when arteries that are narrowed or blocked keep a section of 
the heart from getting enough oxygen which is carried in the blood 
cocaine restricts blood supply to the heart while increasing the 
heart rate blood pressure and demand for oxygen 
this is the strongest evidence to date that cocaine may cause 
spasming of the coronary arteries said dr jeffrey isner a 
cardiovascular medicine professor at bostons tufts university 
this really is incontrovertible evidence he said calling the 
study a spectacular report 
but douglas wilkerson who studies the cardiovascular effects of 
cocaine at the medical college of ohio cautioned that researchers 
do not have enough evidence to attribute the heart attacks to 
spasms of the arteries 
some scientists argue that the heart attacks could be caused 
instead by clots forming in the arteries or simply by blood flow 
inadequate to the hearts demand he said 
one member of the los angeles group dr david gorelick now 
with the national institute of drug abuse said the group ruled out 
heart disease as the cause of the temporary heart abnormalities in 
the subjects 
with longer periods of abstinence from cocaine the blood 
flow went back to normal he said 
the report has immediate impact on how emergency room physicians 
will treat addicts experiencing chest pains according to dr 
william spivey chief of emergency room research at the medical 
college of pennsylvania 
its going to make us realize that were going to have 
problems after withdrawal with these cocaine addicts said 
spivey 
the study opens our eyes to the value of preventive medical 
treatment for addicts withdrawing from cocaine said dr gary 
schaer a cardiologist at rushpresbyterianst lukes medical 
center in chicago 
an estimated 25 million americans have used cocaine at least 
once including 6 million regular users and 1 million addicts 
according to isner 
gorelick said the los angeles scientists now plan to focus on 
how cocaine use alters the chemicals in the brain to reduce the 
flow of blood to the heart and use other more precise tests to 
examine heart function in cocaine addicts

following are excerpts from the official 
englishlanguage text of soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
speech thursday evening at the campidoglio romes city hall 
our time is indeed a watershed of destiny we need 
spiritual values we need a revolution of the mind 
of late there has been much talk in the west that the world 
community will really become a single whole only if the other 
side ie the soviet union abandons its ideological and social 
values frankly we are often told that we should purely and simply 
renounce socialism then it is said the world will become a nice 
and easy place to live in it may sound simplistic but i am 
deliberately reducing the argument to its essence 
this is not the approach that the world needs as it is taking a 
great turn to a new era it is another example of wishful thinking 
of the temptation to make policies on the basis of illusions rather 
than reality 
we have abandoned the claim to have a monopoly on the truth we 
no longer think that we are the best and that we are always right 
that those who disagree with us are our enemies we have now 
decided firmly and irrevocably to base our policy on the 
principles of freedom of choice to build our economy and 
technology on the principle of mutual advantage and to develop our 
culture and ideology through dialogue and acceptance of all that is 
applicable in our conditions and hence all that should be 
digested and used for our own progress 
unless we get rid of all things associated with the deformations 
of socialism in the past we will not succeed in implementing the 
ideas of perestroika 
we want to give second wind to the soviet federation quite 
frankly it will take deft handling for interethnic relations is 
a fragile and delicate sphere but perestroika will enable us to 
solve this problem crucial for the future of our state 
we have changed our attitude to some matters such as for 
example religion which admittedly we used to treat in a 
simplistic manner 
but now we not only proceed from the assumption that no one 
should interfere in matters of the individuals conscience we also 
say that the moral values which religion generated and embodied for 
centuries can help in the work of renewal in our country too 
today the focus is on the socialist world having embarked upon 
the road of radical reform the socialist countries one after 
another are crossing the line beyond which there is no return to 
the past 
nevertheless it is wrong to insist as many in the west do 
that this is the collapse of socialism the end of the socialist 
system on the contrary it means that the socialist process in the 
world having accumulated extensive although admittedly dramatic 
experience will pursue its further development in a multiplicity 
of forms it will thus acquire new opportunities for moving toward 
its just and noble goals for releasing the enormous humanistic and 
democratic potential contained in the socialist idea 
let us leave it to experts in anticommunist propaganda to 
rejoice in the triumph of capitalism in the cold war 
we hope that next year all european countries the united states 
and canada will sign a historic document which will begin a new 
countdown in the area of military policy 
my meeting with president george bush will i am convinced 
enable us to take a new constructive step in the movement from 
mutual understanding to mutual action in sovietus relations 
i believe that this years events underscore the desirability of 
an alleuropean summit a helsinki2 meeting we could consider 
advancing its date from 1992 to say as early as 1990 
in the final analysis we envision europe as a commonwealth of 
sovereign democratic states with a high level of equitable 
interdependence and easily accessible borders open to the exchange 
of products technologies and ideas and wideranging contacts among 
people

a hotel built too close to an airport 
radar because of a typographical error had its grand opening 
thursday renewing air traffic controllers complaints that it 
blocks some radar coverage 
the controllers dispute the governments claim that keeping 
planes at high altitudes above the blind spot is a temporary 
solution 
its just as bad if not worse said cheryl readio a member 
of the national air traffic controllers association we still 
cant see airplanes in that area 
controllers said they would like to see the federal aviation 
administration make a stronger response to an unsatisfactory 
condition report filed in may at the time controllers noticed 
that as the sixstory quality suites hotel went up more and more 
planes began disappearing from the radar screen 
the faa conducted tests that showed gaps in radar coverage up to 
about 2000 feet in a corridor of air space up to seven miles wide 
and extending about 25 to 35 miles southwest of portland 
international jetport 
until the radar can be moved the agency adopted interim 
guidelines under which airplanes going through the area are kept 
well above 2000 feet said walter claxton faa tower manager at 
the airport 
i cant say the problem is completely solved claxton said 
we set up the interim procedures until the problem is solved if 
it was a real safety issue the radar would have been moved two 
months ago or wed put a new one in 
claxton said only small planes are affected because larger 
planes are not flying that low when they are 30 miles out 
jim breen the new england representative of the air traffic 
controllers association said controllers also have to keep 
jetliners out of the area even if they are at a high altitude 
because pilots cannot be advised about what might be flying under 
them 
ms readio said commercial flights from boston often go near the 
area and controllers have to make sure they stay away from the 
blind spot 
we cant tell them whats there breen said from bradley 
international airport just north of hartford conn the system 
could be safer by getting this radar moved soon 
claxton said the radar might be moved within the next year 
were going to move the radar claxton said where were 
going to move it im not sure it kind of sits low on the airport 
and things were fine until the building came along 
the faa said it never objected to the hotel construction because 
when the project was first proposed the developers plans 
contained a typo that indicated the building would be 12000 feet 
from the runway when it was in fact just 1200 feet from the runway 
breen blames the faa for the mixup 
twelvehundred feet and 12000 feet are quite a bit 
different breen said typo or not youd think somebody would 
have noticed it

a former cia agent who fled to the soviet 
union just before he was charged with passing secrets was recently 
ordered expelled from hungary us officials said thursday 
the us government urged hungary to permanently bar edward lee 
howard a defector wanted on an espionage charge who has made 
extended visits to the eastern block country said the officials 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in 1985 howard eluded fbi surveillance near his home in santa 
fe nm and fled the country two days before he was charged in a 
warrant with passing secrets to the soviet union 
he later turned up in moscow and the soviet union announced 
nearly a year after his defection that it had given howard 
political asylum 
howard 37 is charged with selling secrets to the soviet union 
for 6000 in 1984 during a trip to austria 
he is said to have exposed the network of cia contacts in 
moscow a spy post for which he was trained but never assigned to 
because he was fired in 1983 
he certainly gave away the entire cia operation in moscow 
said david wise author of the 1988 book about the howard case 
entitled the spy who got away wise reported in the book that 
howard was paid more than 150000 
one official confirmed that howard was still in the soviet bloc 
wise said howard was probably in moscow where he has an apartment 
and a nearby summer house 
besides exposing deaddrop locations and codes the cia employed 
to contact soviet contacts wise said howard exposed details of 
electronic eavesdropping the agency conducted in the soviet capital 
there wasnt much he didnt give up wise said 
cia director william webster made a veiled reference to howards 
expulsion when asked by reporters wednesday about cooperation 
between intelligence agencies of the soviet union and eastern bloc 
nations 
webster cited the case of a a prominent defector from the 
united states who was permanently expelled from a bloc country 
which had provided him comfort and sanctuary in the past 
and that would have been contrary to the wishes of the kgb 
said webster who didnt identify howard or the country by name 
but the us officials confirmed a report in thursdays editions 
of the los angeles times that webster was referring to howards 
expulsion from hungary 
asked about the report hungarian interior ministry spokesman 
lt col janos horvach said in a telephone interview its news 
to me 
justice department spokesman david runkel refused to comment 
about the case 
attorney general dick thornburgh met with howards handler 
during a recent visit to moscow 
thornburgh met with vladimir a kryuchkov who was the no 2 kbg 
official at the time he was directing howard runkel said the 
howard case was not discussed during the meeting at kgb 
headquarters 
the meeting was scheduled only to talk about areas where there 
could be discussion on cooperation in the law enforcement area 
including efforts to combat terrorism runkel said 
wise who interviewed howard for his book during a visit to 
hungary said the former cia agent spent a lot of time in that 
country enjoying visits to budapest and lake bolatov a resort 
area 
i would doubt if he would set foot in the west for fear of 
being snatched by us agents wise said howard was even nervous 
about visiting budapest where he feared the cia could inject a 
tranquilizer in his arm and spirit him across the austrian border 
wise said 
given the current political climate in eastern europe wise said 
it is most likely that howard has returned to the soviet union 
where he would feel safe from us efforts to arrest him 
while howard would not be subject to extradition from a western 
country because espionage is a political crime wise pointed out 
that he might feel threatened by the new overseas snatch authority 
conferred on the fbi 
a legal opinion issued last june by the justice department said 
that the fbi had the legal authority to seize us fugitives 
overseas without the permission of a foreign government 
wise reported in his book that howard was paid handsomely for 
his spying by the soviets howard had 150000 in a swiss bank 
account before he defected and afterwards his wife mary led fbi 
agents to a spot in the new mexico desert where her husband had 
buried 10000 worth of gold and other valuables 
howards wife who lives in the minneapolis area with the 
couples son could not be reached for comment

patients have a right to basic health care from 
attentive courteous doctors who tell them their choices for 
treatment according to the american medical associations first 
patient bill of rights 
in a brief list of six principles the nations largest 
physicians organization spells out the responsibilities doctors 
have to those who seek their help 
the document issued thursday is being presented for approval at 
next weeks meeting in honolulu of the amas house of delegates 
the bill is a reaffirmation of what is inherent in the 
relationship of physician to patient the amas general counsel 
kirk johnson said in a telephone interview thursday 
it is coming now not because physicians need to be reminded 
of their responsibilities he said but because patients need to 
know and retain their trust in the basic elements of their 
relationship with their physician 
johnson said the bill of rights was devised over the past year 
by the associations council on ethical and judicial affairs the 
house of delegates may accept it as is or send it back to the 
council for further explanation he said 
the bill of rights is something that patients can understand 
simple straightforward and the minimum that patients can expect 
from their physicians he said 
it includes a patients right to essential health care 
regardless of ability to pay and suggests in an attached commentary 
that physicians have a responsibility to provide some 
uncompensated care to the indigent 
a critic of the ama immediately took issue with the document 
saying that in many ways the ama circumvents the bills intent in 
its everyday actions 
these are sort of apple pie motherhood ideas rights which 
none could disagree with said dr sidney wolfe director of 
public citzen health research group 
there are two main problems they the principles arent 
enforceable and many of them run completely contrary to what the 
ama does and stands for said wolfe whose group a 
washingtonbased consumer health research and advocacy 
organization is in its 18th year 
if they took action to ensure that these rights were 
translated into results for patients it would be another thing 
the ama has hardly been at the forefront in ensuring that 
for example patients have access to information showing 
differences between hospitals and doctors 
johnson discounted the criticism saying the bill of rights is 
valuable and needed 
patients the document says have the right to receive 
information and know the benefits risks and financial costs of 
their treatment they also have the right to make their own 
decisions on the treatment of their illness it says 
the patient has the right to courtesy respect dignity 
responsiveness and timely attention according to one article of 
the bill which adds physicians have an obligation to schedule 
their appointments in a way that respects the value of the 
patients time 
the documents final principle says a patient has the right to 
continuity of health care according to the attached commentary 
the physician may not discontinue treatment of a patient as long 
as further treatment is medically indicated unless alternative 
arrangements are available

john r pearman who was driving the first assembly of god church

with disfiguring burns 
carroll circuit court judge charles satterwhite called a 
15minute recess after ciaran foran 16 of radcliff broke down in 
sobs during testimony 
miss foran sobbed heavily when asked by assistant attorney 
general paul richwalksy jr to describe what she had seen seconds 
after the bus collided with a wrongway driver on interstate 71 
some jurors turned their eyes away from miss foran who was 
wearing a special pressure garment to assist healing of severe 
burns on her neck face and shoulder 
after the unscheduled break miss foran testified that her head 
was resting on a plastic helium balloon that blew up in her face 
after the crash miss foran spent about six weeks in a hospital and 
underwent 19 operations

president bush on thursday filled two 
vacancies on the board of the legal services corp on the eve of a 
scheduled vote to replace the organizations president terrence 
wear 
bush gave socalled recess appointments to former rep john 
erlenborn rill and texas attorney j blakely hall to sit on the 
board that oversees the independent agency that gives legal help to 
the nations poor 
bush made the appointments during the yearend recess of 
congress thus avoiding senate confirmation proceedings 
under the constitution people given recess appointments can 
serve until the end of the congresional session in this case the 
end of 1990 
the board meeting scheduled for friday is the latest in 
skirmishing between two factions over the nature of legal services 
the corporations board has been a battleground for 
conservatives seeking to limit legal services particularly 
classaction lawsuits against the government over welfare and other 
social programs 
conservatives also object to legal services representing 
plaintiffs in lawsuits to force hospitals to give abortions to 
indigent women 
this faction held a 65 majority on the board until two 
vacancies recently occurred said carolyn stewart of the national 
legal aid and defenders association 
the group monitors the agency and supports efforts to allow 
legal services lawyers to provide a full range of representation 
she said 
supporters of a broader range of legal services held a 54 
majority on the board before bush made the appointments on thursday 
the board was scheduled friday to consider a move to oust wear 
and demand an accounting of more than 100000 spent to hire a 
former reagan administration official to provide outside legal 
advice stewart said 
the money was paid for legal opinions provided by charles 
cooper a former assistant attorney general in the reagan 
administration and a conservative activist stewart said those 
opinions include one by cooper that the corporation is 
unconstitutional 
stewart said her organization did not know how erlenborn would 
vote if he attended fridays meeting 
now a private attorney in washington erlenborn was considered a 
supporter of legal services when he represented a suburban chicago 
congressional district she said 
earlier this year conservative activists successfully lobbied 
the white house to stop the appointment of former republican rep 
caldwell butler of virginia to the board 
butler had angered conservatives by stating he would not support 
restrictions on the activities of legal aid attorneys

margaret said he never gave up hope a suspect would be arrested in 
his daughters killing 
the law has a very long memory he said after 20 years 
almost on the anniversary and its pretty close to the day its 
something you hope for all this time 
san mateo county sheriffs department lt mike dow said 
detectives believe franklin killed the girl because he had tried to 
sexually molest her 
at carmichael a suburb of sacramento a close friend of 
franklin said the arrest shocked them both 
i talked to him today and hes still in shock he has

urging an end to eastwest divisions gorbachev said the changes 
sweeping eastern europe and toppling hardline communist regimes 
are irrevocable he said they do not signal the collapse of 
socialism but rather further development of a concept with 
noble goals and enormous humanistic and democratic potential

were about on the same wavelength from what ive heard from the 
briefings by european leaders who had recently spoken with 
gorbachev 
half a world away authorities on the mediterranean island of 
malta were busy mobilizing the military and even the boy scouts 
in preparation for the superpower leaders 
not even a shortage of tiny wavable soviet flags was enough to 
hamper the preparations said eddie stafrace who reported selling 
160 american and maltese flags a day from his little toy store 
behind the palace of the grand masters in valletta 
bush and gorbachev will meet saturday beginning 11 hours of

said they want them to be carried out peacefully

leaders the soviet president said the 35nation meeting he called

europe

city hall where the treaty was signed in 1957 establishing the 
european common market 
on the eve of his historic meeting with pope john paul ii he 
said that soviets have changed their attitude toward religion and 
now believe religious values can help in the restructuring of 
soviet society

gorbachevs proposal the president replied ill talk to him

a kremlin official thursday warned lithuanians 
that their efforts to form an independent communist party would 
hurt national reforms while party members across the baltics 
pushed for more freedom from moscow 
the aspiration of certain forces to drive a wedge between the 
lithuanian communist party and the soviet communist party will 
benefit no one but will only complicate the process of 
perestroika tass quoted vadim a medvedev the kremlin ideology 
chief and a member of the ruling politburo as telling communists 
in lithuanias capital vilnius 
despite the wellpublicized kremlin hostility to the 
lithuanians intentions 39 communists in neighboring latvia 
including eight members of the local partys central committee 
called for founding a politically organizationally and 
economically independent communist party tass reported 
many party organizations in the republic look at the address 
of the 39 communists as a call for the splitting of the latvian 
party the official news agency reported from riga latvias 
capital 
meanwhile in estonia the third baltic republic the local 
partys ideology chief mikk titma said in an interview with his 
partys daily that he is certain the legal guarantee of the 
partys leading role in political life will be eliminated from 
estonias constitution 
some kind of coalition will then govern estonia titma said 
in the interview printed in the sunday edition of the sovietskaya 
estonia newspaper 
the political changes in the baltic republics come against the 
backdrop of upcoming local elections across the country which 
begin in some parts of the soviet union on dec 10 
for the first time nationwide voters will be offered a choice 
of candidates for their local soviets or governing councils 
party officials in the once independent baltic republics have said 
they must have a free hand to set policies popular with voters or 
risk defeat 
medvedev who was quoted by tass traveled to lithuania 
wednesday to take part in a highlevel party meeting he spoke 
thursday to vilniusbased delegates to a special congress of 
lithuanias communist party which will open dec 19 
on the congress agenda is a draft program proclaiming the 
republics party a political force in the creation of an 
independent lawgoverned lithuanian state

leaders have rejected autonomy for local party organizations in the 
name of democratic centralism lithuanian party leaders were 
summoned to moscow on nov 16 to make their intentions known to the 
full communist party politburo including soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev and medvedev 
gorbachev strongly opposes plans for the lithuanian party to 
separate from the national communist party which he has headed 
since march 1985 at the meeting in vilnius medvedev advocated 
more rights for the local parties in the 15 constituent soviet 
republics but only within the renewing soviet communist party 
tass reported 
in latvia the dissident communists called for renouncing the 
utopian goal of building communist society and the dogmatic 
interpretation of marxismleninism tass said 
despite criticism of the dissidents the latvian politburo 
admitted it was losing the initiative and decided to organize 
working groups to draft the rules and program of the latvian party 
tass said 
latvias communist party also scheduled a plenum of its central 
committee in january to renew its composition and make changes 
in the party apparatus tass said indicating the likelihood of 
sweeping personnel changes

latvias major party and government newspapers according to a 
telex sent to the moscow bureau of the associated press by the

the state house adjourned thursday without 
tackling a 12 billion taxhike package that signaled the end of 
the economic boom dubbed the massachusetts miracle and 
triggered a firestorm of taxpayer protest 
a statehouse switchboard operator said she was handling 100 
calls every 15 minutes from irate taxpayers 
speaker george keverian after a day of vote hunting recessed 
the house without opening debate on the package approved wednesday 
by the house ways and means committee it includes hikes in sales 
capital gains and gasoline taxes 
considerable time has gone by today and i apologize to many of 
you who have been here waiting for the beginning of debate 
keverian said our position is the same as it was we intend to 
make some refinements and some suggestions tomorrow 
the committees package would add two cents to the sales tax 
increase the gas tax by 10 cents over the next two years and hike 
capital gains from 5 percent to 75 percent most increases would 
take effect jan 1 1990 but the capital gains would be 
retroactive to last january 
the proposal is the legislatures latest move to deal with the 
deficit which a ways and means staffer said had swelled to 825 
million 
as the committee sent the proposal to the house the senate held 
hearings on a 350 million houseapproved package of spending cuts 
keverian said later thursday the democratic leadership would 
propose an amendment to lower the sales tax increase to 6 cents on 
the dollar up from the current 5 cents that would cost 190 
million in new revenue this fiscal year and about 400 million next 
year 
keverian said the loss would be made up with additional cuts and 
possibly with additional revenue in the tax package he said he did 
not anticipate any other significant changes although he would not 
predict the outcome of a vote on a rankandfile amendment he said 
he expects will be offered to remove the capitalgains tax hike 
from the bill 
gov michael s dukakis who had suggested he had some 
reservations about the package urged approval saying he realized 
taxes were unpopular but elected officials should take a tough 
stand 
if theres anything weve got to have now its fiscal 
stability the governor said and thats what this package is 
going to bring 
the republican minority leader rep steven pierce said the 
size of the package and the leaderships effort to rush it through 
were a losing combination 
they failed to get it out because theyre pushing an 
outrageous bill pierce said adding that it had set off a 
firestorm of angry criticism from an angry public 
the answer should be the same no matter what the package is 
the answer should be no pierce said 
rep marjorie clapprood a democrat and supporter of the 
package predicted the sales tax increase would be lowered i 
think it is clear as the package stands we are short of the 81 
votes needed to pass it she said 
clapprood suggested shutting off the statehouse switchboard and 
locking lawmakers in the house chamber to get the bill passed 
she said she got one call at home at 430 am thursday from a 
woman opposed to higher taxes 
the whole state of massachusetts has called said one of the 
statehouses two switchboard operators who declined to give her 
name 
barbara anderson of the citizens for limited taxation said the 
legislature was trying to con voters into accepting taxes by 
slashing human services and education budgets 
the point is are we going to give into this kind of 
blackmail she said

hundreds of americans many 
waving white flags on thursday fled combat by leftist guerrillas 
that shattered the peace of their upscale neighborhoods and headed 
back to the united states 
the roman catholic churchs legal aid office meanwhile issued a 
report concluding that soldiers carried out the nov 16 massacre of 
six jesuit priests and their two domestic employees 
guerrillas fired their first antiaircraft missile wednesday but 
missed the target an air force a37 jet fighterbomber near 
zacatecoluca 25 miles south of san salvador a western military 
source reported 
a rebel statement said the insurgents would not use the missiles 
if government aircraft stopped bombing strafing and firing rockets 
members of the salvadoran high command have said missiles could 
signficantly alter the balance of power in the fighting 
the civil war has gone on 10 years and killed 71000 people 
im not coming back kate lewis a teacher at the american 
school said as she carried her 8monthold baby cassandra down 
mirador street to where a us embassy official was waiting for her 
and her husband william 
other americans flashed vforvictory signs at international 
airport and shouted well be back after christmas 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said departure is voluntary for all embassy dependents and 
personnel who are scheduled for leave or can be spared we do not 
know how many private american residents will take advantage of 
this opportunity we are encouraging american dependents and 
personnel who can be spared to depart 
the lewis home and 30 or 40 others in the exclusive escalon 
neighborhood in the citys western sector were taken by guerrillas 
before dawn wednesday 
rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front or 
fmln observed a sixhour truce beginning 6 am 7 am est in 
their 20day offensive to permit evacuation of those who wished to 
leave 
the neighborhood was quiet thursday afternoon and remaining 
residents ventured out to assess damage and clear rubble soldiers 
moved cautiously along the streets and drew no fire the last 
guerrilla snipers appeared to have pulled out from their nests in 
sumptuous homes most of the rebels appeared to have retreated up 
nearby san salvador volcano by dawn 
the fmln is maintaining a constant siege of the capital which 
is the neurological center of the nation the fuse of a social 
timebomb has been lit said the clandestine rebel radio 
venceremos 
about 20 us citizens were among scores of people who took 
advantage of the truce to leave escalon many waved white flags and 
carried small bundles as they walked past a burnedout light tank 
the bodies of soldiers and guerrilla barricades of expensive cars 
with the tires shot out 
military spokesmen said five soldiers and 12 guerrillas were 
killed in wednesdays fighting reporters counted the bodies of at 
least 10 soldiers and saw one dead guerrilla a woman still 
clutching her usmade m16 rifle 
four bodies unrecognizable as soldiers guerrillas or civilians 
were burned on a sidewalk 
about 150 us citizens left on the first of two charter flights 
arranged by the us embassy they included embassy employees and 
dependents and americans living in el salvador for other reasons 
many had taken refuge in the embassy or the headquarters of the 
us agency for international development headquarters both well 
away from the fighting 
many luxury homes and automobiles were shot up but residents of 
escalon had few complaints about their treatment by the raggedy 
unwashed invaders 
they were kind and gentle said sheri mckibben of cleveland 
who was leaving with her husband sam 
mrs lewis said one rebel ventured out to bring fruit juice for 
her baby 
manuel vides a 48yearold businessman used his 9mm pistol in 
a 20minute gun battle with rebels who tried to enter his home but 
surrendered after they fired a light antitank rocket at his house 
they spared my life and i have to thank them for that he 
said 
guerrillas took over the home of retired us army col george 
mynus former military attache at the us embassy his wife 
rosie said wounded guerrillas were treated there they and their 
three children left thursday 
a young salvadoran man whose house was occupied described the 
guerrillas as very respectful but added the very act of 
invading a civilian neighborhood and turning it into a combat zone 
is a great maliciousness on their part 
in the report on the massacre at the simeon canas central 
american university the church legal aid office said all the 
evidence and indicators establish that those responsible for the 
murder of the six jesuit priests and their two domestics were 
members of the armed forces 
it noted that the attackers wore army uniforms according to a 
witness they spent at least an hour shooting up part of the campus 
in the middle of a dusktodawn curfew the zone was militarized 
with troops guarding southern access to the nearby headquarters of 
the joint chiefs of staff the assassins used sophisticated arms 
including flamethrowers and burned some priests offices and 
soldiers searched the residence two days before the massacre 
president alfredo cristiani has promised to find and punish 
those responsible 
a small plane carrying 25 antiaircraft missiles crashed 
saturday in eastern el salvador the government said the plane and 
its fourman crew all of whom died were nicaraguan and broke 
diplomatic relations with managua 
missiles are presumed to have been delivered on another plane 
that landed saturday in southern el salvador and was burned by its 
crew

president bush on thursday reluctantly signed 
into law a bill creating a new independent inspector general within 
the central intelligence agency two years after such a move was 
called for by congressional investigators of the irancontra affair 
the new law is one of three irancontra related measures 
congress sent to bush at the end of this years legislative 
session bush now has signed two and is expected to approve the 
third even though his administration believes the bills place 
unwarranted restrictions on its foreign policy activities 
creation of the new inspector generals office similar to the 
oversight posts at other government agencies that review federal 
programs and seek to ferret out abuses was part of a broader bill 
authorizing us intelligence activities for the coming year 
while the precise spending authorized by the bill is secret it 
reportedly involves between 25 billion and 30 billion for 
intelligence collection and analysis upgraded spy satellites and 
other hardware and covert operations overseas 
in a statement bush said the new inspector general post could 
impair the ability of the cia to collect vitally needed 
intelligence information by creating a perception that 
confidentiality cannot be guaranteed 
to secure cooperation the cia must be able to assure foreign 
individuals and organizations that their identities the fact of 
their association with the united states and the information they 
provide are not subject to expoure added bush himself a former 
cia director 
a day earlier cia director william webster said while the 
provision could damage confidence of foreign intelligence services 
in us ability to keep secrets he would seek to rebuild 
safeguards against compromising intelligence sources and methods 
if it becomes law we will do our best to make it work 
webster said 
bush said his objections were mitigated by a provision that 
would let the cia director kill any inspector generals 
investigation he believed might compromise national security 
interests 
he vowed he will resist any attempt by the intelligence 
committees to micromanage the cia through the vehicle of a 
statutory inspector general 
the new inspector general would be appointed by the president 
and confirmed by the senate and the auditors reports would be 
available to the house and senate committees that oversee us 
intelligence 
currently the agencys inspector general is appointed by the 
cia director and reports only to him that arrangement has caused 
friction with the house intelligence committee which has been 
denied access to some reports 
congressional investigators who probed the irancontra scandal 
said the agencys inspector general lacked independence and didnt 
have the manpower resources or tenacity to uncover 
armsforhostages transactions or the diversion of profits to 
nicaraguas contra rebels 
the implication was that as an underling of former cia director 
william casey who was deeply involved in the affair the inspector 
general lacked the muscle to detect or report on irancontra abuses 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the house irancontra 
investigating panel said bushs acceptance of the new inspector 
general provision was not easy for him to do it represents a 
concession on the part of the president a deference to the 
congressional sensitivity on this 
the bill also keeps on track a multibilliondollar program to 
upgrade the nations intelligence collection through socalled 
national technical means or satellites and other electronic 
spying 
the program apparently doubles the rate at which the government 
will be launching lacrosse radar satellites which orbit about 400 
miles up and can penetrate darkness and cloud cover to take 
highresolution pictures of the earth said john pike of the 
federation of american scientists 
impetus for the buildup began with us ratification of the 
intermediaterange nuclear arms control treaty with the soviet 
union which brought new requirements for verification and has 
been given additional urgency by the likelihood of new strategic 
and convention arms control treaties with the soviets in the coming 
months 
last week bush signed a foreign aid bill that includes a 
warning against using us aid money as a leverage to induce 
recipients to carry out american policy goals that otherwise would 
be forbidden by us law the provision is a reaction to president 
reagans apparent use of aid money as a reward to honduras for 
harboring the nicaraguan contra rebels in its territory along the 
nicaraguan border 
still pending but expected to be signed by bush is a bill that 
would impose criminal penalties on any official who permits sales 
of restricted arms to terrorist countries a list that now includes 
syria libya iran north korea south yemen and cuba the measure 
seeks to eliminate loopholes like the ones that permitted the 
armsforhostages deal with iran

president bush on thursday announced he was 
vetoing a bill to allow chinese students to remain in the united 
states after their visas expire calling it unnecessary and an 
infringement on his presidential authority 
bush said in a statement that the measure was unneeded in light 
of administrative steps he had taken to accomplish the same ends 
including new measures taken thursday 
the president said he was directing the attorney general to 
take the steps necessary to extend administratively to all chinese 
students in the united states the same benefits that were in the 
rejected bill 
however a congressional sponsor of the legislation rep bruce 
a morrison dconn accused bush of yielding to pressure from the 
beijing government which had strongly opposed the measure 
im shocked that the president would kowtow in this way to the 
demands of the chinese communist government especially when that 
government was threatening chiense students here in the united 
states and telling them that the united states was not going to 
protect them said morrison chairman of a house judiciary 
subcommittee on immigration 
and sen edward m kennedy dmass said in a statement 
i oppose the veto and i hope congress will override it the 
president should have stood up for the courageous chinese students 
instead of bowing to the cruel chinese regime 
democratic leaders had similar comments sen george mitchell 
dmaine majority leader of the senate said bushs action was a 
grave mistake and rep richard gephardt dmo majority 
leader in the house the no 2 position there said it was a 
tragic error that the house would make its first item of 
business when we return in january 
the president said he was rejecting the legislation with a 
pocket veto a procedural device available when congress is in 
recess but has the same impact as a regular veto 
when congress is in recess a president can veto a bill by 
simply taking no action on it or pocketing it thus the term 
pocket veto congress has gone home for the year an override as 
mentioned by kennedy would have to be done through an entirely new 
bill in the 1990 session 
aboard air force one en route to the malta summit bush told 
reporters he acted to preserve executive control of foreign policy 
i want to keep control of foreign policy as much as i can 
bush said opposition is quite an emotional feeling but im 
going to protect the office of the president 
bush earlier criticized the measure claiming it was unneeded 
because he already agreed to extend student visas in the aftermath 
of the governments bloody crackdown on protesters in tianenmen 
square in june 
congressional sponsors of the measure however said that bushs 
gesture did not go far enough and that many of the 40000 chinese 
students now studying in the united states had not taken advantage 
of it 
in most cases visas for visiting foreign students are issued 
for two years the bill bush vetoed would extend the chinese 
students visas for more four years and then give them a chance at 
applying for permanent residency 
bush said the measure passed by congress was another attempt by 
lawmakers to micromanage foreign policy such legislation puts 
america in a straitjacket and can render us incapable of responding 
to changing circumstances bush said 
chinese and other foreign visitors should know that this is 
not an expedient or temporary action but one reflecting 
fundamental american humanitarian values 
bush said he was reemphasizing my commitment as i have told 
chinese students in america and as i have told congress to never 
allow any action that would force the return of chinese students if 
their lives or liberty are at risk 
bush also announced that he was expanding a program for offering 
political asylum to chinese visitors who opposed that nations 
policy of forced sterilization or abortion to all foreign 
nationals regardless of their country of origin 
us law permits the admission to the country as refugees people 
who can show a wellfounded fear of persecution at home the 
administration has granted such a status to chinese who claim they 
would be persecuted for their opposition to what the us 
government claims are coerced sterilizations and abortions in china 
whether bushs announcement would actually apply to anyone was 
not clear no one has accused any other country of such coercive 
family planning policies

a leading us scientist says there is 
statistical evidence of a possible link between cancer and exposure 
to electromagnetic fields that radiate from the cables and wires 
that electrify the nation 
the unpublished findings by dr genevieve matanoski an 
epidemiology professor at johns hopkins university run against the 
grain of traditional scientific theory about the possibility of 
health dangers from power distribution lines 
her conclusions fit an emerging pattern of evidence however 
that the possibility of health risks can no longer be ruled out and 
should be studied more closely 
this is consistent with my judgment that well end up 
seeing electric and magnetic fields are cancer promoters of some 
kind said indira nair a physicist at carnegie mellon university

injections of the natural diseasefighting protein 
interferon give doctors their first effective weapon against 
hepatitis c a virus that infects at least 150000 americans 
annually according to a report today 
in my opinion this is a major clinical advance said dr 
gary l davis of the university of florida 
the work appears to represent another milestone in a year of 
advances against this elusive virus until recently doctors were 
sure of only two hepatitis viruses type a and type b since many 
people got hepatitis without exposure to these viruses their 
disease was simply labeled nona nonb 
in april researchers from chiron corp in emeryville calif 
reported the discovery of a new hepatitis virus which they called 
hepatitis c they said it is the principal culprit in nona nonb 
hepatitis they also described a new test that will reveal whether 
blood is tainted with the virus

johnnie l johnson knows what its like 
to be on death row alone with his thoughts in the middle of the 
night 
a thin man with pale skin and the long sideburns of a hustler 
he spent 12 years onethird of his lifetime on the row for 
his role in the 1973 slaying of a savannah ga woman a killing 
he claims stemmed from a busted drug deal 
on death row its the waiting that really gets to you 
johnson said during an interview at the georgia state prison at 
reidsville you feel so helpless all you can do is sit there in 
your cell while some judge somewhere looks at your appeal and 
decides if you live or die 
i used to stare at the wall of my cell for hours id look at 
it for so long that pictures would start to appear on the wall and 
then and i know this sounds crazy but the pictures would start 
to move 
imaginary images are not only a torment however johnsons 
imagination has helped him escape through the prizewinning 
poetry he writes 
still prison officials say hes known best not as a writer but 
as a death row inmate who escaped literally in 1980 
wearing makeshift guard uniforms fashioned from pajamas johnson 
and three other inmates broke out with outside help 
the dye for the uniforms arrived in some stereo headphones 
and the hacksaw blades were in the handle of a portable radio he 
said 
we sawed through the screen on an air vent and climbed through 
the vent to the roof then we walked across the roof of the 
prison in plain sight of the guard tower 
he said they drove off in a car that had been left for them 
nearby 
i was never so scared in my life johnson recalled we 
were pretending to be inspecting the roof i was sure the sniper in 
that tower would start shooting at any minute 
they were recaptured three days later in charlotte nc 
during the long bleak hours following his recapture johnson 
began writing poetry he says it was an effort to keep from going 
stir crazy 
poetry was my safety valve on death row you might be 
surprised to know that quite a few of the inmates here write 
poetry 
the subjects are the same as those taken up by poets who arent 
behind bars johnson says unrequited love how you feel about 
things how people feel about you 
once a hellraising kid from beaufort sc johnson has had 
plenty of time to think about such things 
i come from a good family but i got into drugs in the 7th 
grade and went downhill johnson says i quit school in the 
10th grade and was on death row before i was 21 
at my trial my lawyer told me to plead guilty and id get a 
life sentence he recalls but an election was coming up and 
the judge sentenced me to die 
in a poem called maturity johnson writes 
were we so wise 
as we lived by 
the needle and the gun 
is it really living 
when one comes 
so near selfdestruction 
in 1986 an appellate court ruled johnson had not had adequate 
legal counsel at his trial his death sentence was overturned and 
he is now serving a life sentence 
in his poem cellmate he likens his situation to that of 
the tiny spider he discovers living in a remote corner of his death 
row cubicle the poem won the top award in a national prison 
publications contest sponsored by the southern illinois 
universitycarbondale school of journalism in 1987 
the spider he says in the poem 
sits behind his sticky desk 
like a fat pompous official 
a tyrant who dictates to those below 
and so someday 
when his antics no longer please 
and i have grown tired of his presence 
his whole world will be swept away 
with one swish of the broom 
and this cell which some call a room 
will be more empty without him 
i wonder would he be consoled 
if he knew that i too await my fate 
and wonder what broom 
will sweep me away and how soon 
alice stewart the marietta ga attorney whose work got 
johnsons sentence overturned said he has managed to deal with 
his anxiety pretty well for the most part 
johnson who spends his days making license plates said the 
hope that hell get out of prison someday keeps him going he has 
taken college courses while in prison and hopes to get a degree 
meanwhile he says ive got a life of sorts here now that 
im off death row i work i interact with people 
and then too theres always writing or reading i can get 
so involved writing or reading a good book that the walls 
disappear im not even here

here is the text of johnnie l johnsons 
poem cellmate 
in the upper left hand corner of my cell 
beneath the roof of his weatherproof 
concrete sky 
a sly 
and ever alert spider catnaps 
with one hairy hand 
on his webfine fishing line 
a patient fisherman 
he awaits the signal 
announcing the arrival 
of another foolish fly 
who swimming carelessly 
in his ocean of air has 
become ensnared in 
the fishermans net 
yesterday i watched him 
as he gracefully swung 
from his weblimb 
an eightarmed tarzan 
trailing a vine of web behind 
and once he lost his hold and fell 
a short distance into space 
but his safety line held fast 
and for a moment there 
he was like a mountain climber 
dangling in mid air 
and i held my breath until at last 
he pulled himself to shore 
and i laughed aloud to see him stand 
safe but shaken on his own strand 
but he pays no attention to me 
and acts as though he does not see 
his enemy here below 
he sits behind his sticky desk 
like a fat pompous official 
a tyrant who dictates to those below 
and so someday 
when his antics no longer please 
and i have grown tired of his presence 
his whole world will be swept away 
with one swish of the broom 
and this cell which some call a room 
will be more empty without him 
and i shall regret my loss 
because he served me well 
in that he disposed of the flies i loathe 
but moreover he is a compatible companion 
quiet clean neat undemanding 
and doesnt occupy much space 
and i think it good that 
he will never know what whim 
caused the stroke that destroyed him 
i wonder would he be consoled 
if he knew that i too await my fate 
and wonder what broom 
will sweep me away and how soon

although the economy as a whole manages to 
continue expanding business is beginning to suffer a profits 
recession 
the situation is rare since corporate profits are such an 
integral part of the broader economy but the evidence is 
overwhelming while thirdquarter gross national product rose 25 
percent corporate profits fell 
much of the decline was due to a nonrecurring event money 
assigned by five big banks to cover anticipated losses on third 
world loans but even without these losses corporate profits in 
general were off 
while totals are not complete profits for the companies making 
up the standard amp poors 500stock index fell 22 percent to 498 a 
share from 638 a share in the third quarter of 1988 excluding 
the banks the decline was 7 percent 
a survey by the wall street journal showed a 21 percent drop in 
aftertax earnings on continuing operations and another by 
business week indicated a 22 percent drop with both declines 
negatively influenced by bank performance 
several industries performed much worse within the sampp 13 of 
25 industry groups fell from their yearago levels compared with 
eight in the second quarter and just five in the first three months 
of the year 
in addition to the financial sector other big declines occurred 
in the automotive group aerospace printing and publishing 
reviewing the numbers wright investors service said it is 
unlikely to see a fourthquarter repeat of big bank writeoffs 
but you never know it said unusual charges and writeoffs 
have increasingly become a regular feature of fourthquarter 
earnings reports 
while a sluggish though still expanding economy has much to do 
with the declines intense competition is playing a large role 
typified by a 16 percent drop in sears profits after it slashed 
prices in an effort to boost sales 
intense competition also marks the computer fastfood and auto 
industries with the latter attempting to raise prices only to be 
forced into renewed discounting the auto group showed a 29 percent 
yeartoyear earnings decline 
while a decline of that magnitude is considered unusually sharp 
wright points out that it could have been much worse around 46 
percent if chrysler corp hadnt gained 300 million from the sale 
of mitsubishi motors stock 
many economists believe that the decline will level off next 
year but none can provide convincing assurance the unusual event 
such as the billiondollar accident involving exxon corp this 
year seems to have become less so 
moreover while most forecasts for 1990 suggest the economy will 
continue to lumber along on the positive side of a 
recessionexpansion line global competition conceivably could 
continue to erode profits 
edward yardeni senior vice president of prudentialbache 
securities inc continues to believe that the economy will expand 
in 1990 accompanied by a trend to lower interest rates and a 
moderation of inflationary pressures 
the only big change for us is in the outlook for profits he 
wrote this month the economy is clearly experiencing a profits 
recession he said attributing it to competition 
looking on the brighter side of the situation yardeni said he 
hoped consumers would respond favorably to discounted prices and 
cutrate financing if not then the profits recession could 
become a growth recession as well 
a growth recession is generally understood to mean an economy 
that manages to expand but at such a meager rate that the 
difference between growth and shrinkage is little more than 
statistical

people no longer leave chicken soup beneath 
the branches of the historic treaty oak but wellwishers still 
send support from as far as west germany for its struggle to 
survive a poisoning attack 
since the may 31 discovery that it was poisoned with a powerful 
herbicide the centuriesold live oak has shed five sets of leaves 
the sixth is sparse 
it will be spring though before experts know the fate of the 
tree where legend has it that stephen f austin the father of 
texas signed a treaty with the indians the handbook of texas says 
there is little foundation for that tale but that hasnt 
diminished the popularity of the landmark 
the oak is 50 feet tall and has a limb spread of about 120 feet 
throughout the summer wellwishers brought cans of chicken 
soup flowers and cards and rock crystals that some believed would 
transmit healing powers visitors still pin getwell messages 
woven friendship bracelets ribbons and beads on a line strung 
around a barrier surrounding the tree 
a west german company recently shipped organic fertilizer for 
the tree which has undergone myriad treatments contaminated soil 
was replaced and some roots were severed in a move to keep the 
tree from absorbing more poison shade screens were mounted on 
telephone poles to protect it from the summer sun and it was 
misted with water to ease heat stress a saltwater solution was 
pumped in to try to counteract the poison followed by 
energygiving sugar water 
recent tests show the level of the herbicide velpar has been 
significantly reduced said city forester john giedraitis if 
leaves that bud next spring stay on the tree were in luck and 
the tree will survive 
treatment has cost about 80000 plus 40000 worth of 
services dallas billionaire h ross perot has pledged to cover the 
cash outlay 
the man charged with felony criminal mischief in the poisoning 
has been waging a battle of his own 
paul stedman cullen 45 of elroy has been in jail since his 
june 29 arrest unable to make 20000 bail or get it reduced 
because of a prior felony conviction he could face life in prison 
if convicted in the poisoning which authorities say may have been 
done in some sort of ritual 
if an effort to quash cullens indictment fails defense 
attorney terrence kirk said he will try to get the case moved out 
of travis county some people have suggested that the trees 
poisoner should be hung from its branches 
this city basically has been transformed into a city of 
druids treeworshippers people that never heard of the treaty oak 
before wouldnt know the treaty oak from a cactus are now 
clamoring for blood kirk said 
vengeance isnt the only emotion evident however 
gordon israel who lives across the street from the oak and 
picnicked under its branches as a child is growing seedlings from 
its acorns israel said he hopes some seedlings could be planted in 
the treaty oaks place if it dies 
an enterprising entrepreneur sold tshirts bearing a drawing of 
the oak superimposed on a red heart the sales raised more than 
15000 for a special treaty oak fund to finance tree plantings 
citywide 
wellwishers sent a post card addressed to treaty oak austin 
texas and a postal worker delivered it to the tree 
an austin foundry worker suggested bronzing the tree if it dies 
at a cost of more than 1 million and replanting the metal replica 
while the spring growth will be a milestone giedraitis said it 
could be two years before the tree is out of the woods even if 
it lives it always will bear the effects he said like a tree 
that has been struck by lightning 
but no matter what it finally looks like the treaty oak is 
special to visitors like margaret lounsbury of san jose calif 
im a tree person to me this is how a tree is supposed to 
look said ms lounsbury well not with the dead leaves but 
the shape 
we come here to see this thing how its doing every time we 
come to austin said elmer immell of amarillo 
we came to wish the tree well added his wife margot

for nbc on friday nights the southern 
california beaches are protected by baywatch and washington 
dc by mancuso fbi now new york is going to be more or 
less safe then too 
a new police series true blue is joining nbcs lineup next 
friday the show for which hardball was temporarily taken off 
the networks activeduty roster is getting a twohour premiere 
this sunday 
the newcomer is about the new york police departments emergency 
services unit whose troops specialize in all manner of rescues 
they also pack artillery however because they are cops and there 
are bad guys out there 
sometimes they have to shoot and rescue simultaneously thats 
made amply clear sunday in a clinker of a subplotline that has a 
squad of middle east terrorists at large in fun city plastic 
explosives and uzis at the ready 
the baddies of course are evil incarnate not only do they 
plot to blow up the new york stock exchange which would halt even 
junk bond sales they later kidnap a school bus full of children of 
united nations diplomats and threaten to blow them up 
the show is rife with hightech police gear including an 
armored truck to end all armored trucks it also has a lot of 
dumbdumb disco music that usually cranks up as our compassionate 
heroes set forth on missions of high drama 
and if sundays epic is typical the lads in blue will always 
succeed in contrast to a pretty good nbc cop series of yesteryear 
police story in which not all stories had a happy ending 
but there are two bright sides to true blue although it 
must be said its debut wastes guest star amanda plummer in a role 
of few lines and many squints as your basic anglosaxon female 
member of your basic middle east terrorist cell 
true the opener it also has tony lobianco gueststarring as 
doc one of the esu cops spends much time introducing the shows 
11 regulars and their backgrounds the regulars include a russian 
immigrant elya baskin a freelance tv cameraman who continually 
pesters the emergency constables 
and yes a beautiful woman cop ally walker cast as a divorced 
mother who also is a registered nurse joins this traditionally 
male bastion and must face its macho ways which are surprisingly 
subdued here 
but walker like most in the cast has a strong theater 
background it gives her and her relatively unknown colleagues a 
definite edge in salvaging bad lines and generally making their 
characters close to believeable 
it also helps that one of the shows three executive producers 
is sonny grosso a former new york detective famed for his part in 
the citys french connection narcotics case that later became a 
movie naturally 
with grosso at the helm you get a good taste of the closeness 
of cops the practical jokes they play on each other and the wild 
human comedy that can be found in some of the most tragic 
situations cops face 
one example in sundays show a distraught man threatens to leap 
from a building he tells the cops he wants a priest to hear his 
confession before he jumps a young cop nestor serrano posing as 
a hardofhearing padre arrives 
as part of the rescue plot serrano edges closer to the 
wouldbeleaper saying he cant hear him the man erupts you 
sent a deaf priest to hear my last confession god i hate new 
york 
sundays effort has the usual suspects of routine copshow life 
specifically two shootouts with the terrorists the second is part 
of a predictable finale in which a helicopter and a truck trailer 
each go boom 
but there is potential in true blue 
this new entry might just have a chance provided nbc dumps the 
shows emergency disco beat and the nine other episodes filmed so 
far have made a valiant effort to avoid tv cop cliches 
the cast is good let us pray future scripts are too

the ratio of price to earnings long has been one 
of the most popular measurements of value in the stock market so 
well known that it is published each business day in many 
newspapers 
it is easily comprehended being nothing more than the multiple 
of pershare earnings that buyers are willing to pay for a 
companys stock example earnings of 2 a share price 24 equals 
pe of 12 
this very simplicity however provokes critics into warnings 
that it is too simplistic too dated and too variable to provide 
fully reliable information 
simplistic to measure value by pe alone may mean ignoring 
management changes or developing problems dated it measures past 
performance not that of the future variable pes bounce all over 
the lot 
this latter criticism is becoming one of the paramount 
considerations these days one that is perhaps as difficult to 
fathom as any in the marketplace the reason the level of pes 
varies enormously depending on myriad factors 
if these factors were strictly financial perhaps they could be 
understood but they include mass psychology cultural change 
relations between nations threats of war investment money 
available world confidence and on and on 
as a result the markets average pe can vary sharply from year 
to year from one industry to another from country to country 
while you might be able to tell if one companys pe is out of line 
with the market as a whole how do you know that the markets 
average pe also isnt out of whack 
at the end of october according to john dessauer an 
independent analyst who follows stocks throughout the world pes 
in europe were 118 in the united states 137 and in japan 501 
which is too high which too low what are the factors 
cultural economic psychological that justify such differences 
and what do you make of dessauers finding that at the end of 
1982 when the us economic expansion began comparable ratios 
were 108 in europe 101 in the united states and 222 in japan 
dessauer publisher of dessauers journal of financial markets 
orleans mass traced average pes in the united states for 
several decades and found variability that many would consider 
surprising 
a general trend toward higher pes developed through the 1950s 
and 1960s 
in 1950 investors paid on average only seven times earnings for 
the stocks in the dow jones industrial average by 1959 the average 
had risen to 184 times earnings and it peaked in 1961 at 217 
times 
the trend went into reverse in the 1970s 
perhaps because of rising oil prices doubledigit inflation and 
growing budget deficits investors lowered the prices they were 
willing to pay for stocks by 1979 the dows pe ratio was down all 
the way to 68 
from that extreme low the dows pe began rising again in the 
1980s until the great crash of october 1987 recently it stood at 
113 down from a 1987 average of 158 
what does the future hold to even attempt answering that you 
would have to consider the possibilities for the us economy the 
consequences of the cold war ending the contributions that will be 
made by changes in eastern europe the growth rate of chinas 
economy the amount of investment money available 
that might be a beginning the end could never be sighted the 
amount of research necessary to say nothing of its quality would 
consume so much time that it couldnt keep pace with changes 
including those in the average pe 
opinions are always possible however and dessauer believes 
the overwhelming need to invest huge amounts of surplus capital 
can be expected to overcome stock market jitters 
he believes the trend will gather momentum and become 
selfreinforcing his forecast look for world stock markets 
pushed by the forces of a huge global savings pool to be generally 
strong in 1990 and into 1991

students at pricey universities like notre dame yale and 
stanford are dishing up meals in soup kitchens counseling abused 
children and helping the homeless in a domestic version of the 
peace corps 
the work helps defray tuition that can exceed 10000 a year 
but for the students many of them more accustomed to spending 
summers by the lake than on the soup line the volunteerism offers 
extra education 
i think for some of our students those who have grown up in 
wealthy suburbs it brings them into contact with a segment of 
society theyve never encountered said notre dame spokesman 
richard w conklin 
enough of them have come back and given witness to the fact 
that it was a lasting experience conklin said it caused 
reflection that really changed their attitudes especially a wider 
recognition of the less fortunate 
yale recently announced a program to give students 2000 
stipends for taking community service jobs across the country each 
summer a similar program began last summer at stanford offering 
1300 both are based on the james andrews summer scholars 
program which gives about 24 notre dame students 1400 each in 
tuition money to pursue public service projects 
stanfords tuition is 13569 a year yales is 14000 and 
notre dames is 11315 
while tuition stipends may be recent campus volunteerism 
certainly isnt 
weve got a tradition here of volunteering conklin said 
about twothirds of notre dame students engage in volunteer 
services and about one in 10 devotes a year of social service upon 
graduation 
more than half of depauw universitys 2400 students in 
greencastle ind participate in public service projects 
including overseas missionary work and visiting prison inmates at 
yale more than 2000 students a year donate time as did 70 
percent of stanfords graduating seniors last year 
i do hope it does change the image of college students of 
today as not just partygoers said sue cunningham of notre 
dames center for social concerns which oversees the andrews 
program in south bend ind 
the 9yearold program was begun as a memorial to andrews an 
alumnus and coowner of universal press syndicate it is financed 
with contributions from the syndicates talent including 
doonesbury cartoonist garry trudeau and advice columnist 
abigail van buren 
the fund is worth more than 350000 according to conklin who 
said he knows of no universities other than stanford and yale with 
similar programs 
last summer 94 notre dame students participated in public 
service projects and 34 were given stipends through andrews 
scholarships 
despite the assurance of a paycheck at the end of the summer 
the big payoff is often emotional in the fall the andrews 
recipients gather to share stories about their summer of social 
work 
theres not a dry eye in the house after that dinner the 
stories however brief are very poignant said conklin whose 
daughter christina spent a summer working in a home for abused 
children in minneapolis 
i remember my daughter saying she learned not to ask these 
children where they were from because most of them did not have a 
home they were from foster homes and jails it was a question they 
could not answer 
notre dame students have helped innercity youth in cleveland 
counseled pregnant teens in michigan served meals to shutins in 
south carolina and run a religious camp for secondgraders in 
bostons roxbury neighborhood 
its an eyeopener to many of them conklin said these 
experiences take hold its not im a threeday dilettante in the 
city of chicago 
stanfords program had a modest start with three students who 
worked in a neighborhood health care center counseled families 
with dropouts and taught a creative arts and writing program 
its clearly something that has entered the student 
consciousness said betty kaplan who runs the stanford club 
community service fellowship program people feel so impotent 
about the problems we have if you can do anything it certainly 
helps 
at depauw vice president dan quayles alma mater public 
service is emphasized in a program offering a fifth year of classes 
tuitionfree students must take a majority of their classes 
outside their undergraduate major pay for their room board and 
books and carry a 32 gradepoint average the annual tuition 
normally is 10550 
joseph webster jr of fort wayne is the only student enrolled 
this year during the programs first semester five students will 
be selected next year 
webster graduated in may with phi beta kappa honors in 
chemistry to fulfill his public service requirement he works with 
the science department to recruit prospective science majors and 
is studying philosophy religion and psychology ive increased 
my base of knowledge he said i just couldnt intellectually 
hold a conversation with some of these people 
associate dean john white said we are encouraging them to 
take only upperlevel classes we want them to take risks a lot of 
seniors probably have realworld anxiety theyre thinking what 
am i going to do so they may see this as an interesting option 
for them

the future of dengs decade of marketoriented economic reforms 
under which chinas economy staged a remarkable recovery after the 
ruinous 196676 cultural revolution is particularly murky 
to get rich is glorious was the phrase that moved the masses 
in the 1980s but it has fallen out of favor with the ascendancy 
this year of ideological hardliners 
if conservatives such as premier li peng win the power struggle 
the opendoor policy would slow and more emphasis would be placed 
on central planning which would be bitterly opposed by coastal 
regions that prospered greatly during dengs reforms 
chinas uncertain future was summed up recently by us 
ambassador to beijing james lilley who said it may be some 
years before we can put a name or theme to the new chapter china 
will write in the 1990s in the meantime we must be prepared for 
twists and turns that may defy attempts at labeling 
a crisis also could occur in the philippines a fledgling 
democracy where president corazon aquino has said she will not seek 
reelection when her term expires in 1992 no strong candidate has 
emerged as her heir apparent on the politically fractured 
archipelago 
singapores prime minister lee kuan yew malaysias prime 
minister mahathir mohamad and indonesias president suharto are 
strong leaders who also may leave the scene in the coming years 
every leader but one will change in the region said 
broadfoot he expects only the sultan of brunei to still be in 
power at the turn of the century 
one territory that is almost assured of a rough decade is hong 
kong which britain will hand over to china in 1997 
fewer and fewer of the colonys 57 million people have faith in 
communist chinas promise that hong kong can maintain its 
capitalist lifestyle for 50 years and enjoy a high degree of 
autonomy particularly since the suppression of the prodemocracy 
movement in beijing 
huge numbers of people uncertain about the future are emigrating 
from hong kong a foreign passport is the most prized possession in 
the colony and residents are sparing no effort to secure one 
marriage counselors report booming business from people desperately 
seeking foreign national spouses 
the government in estimates often criticized as too 
conservative believes 42000 people will emigrate in 1989 and 
another 55000 will leave the following year 
many highly educated whitecollar workers are among those 
leaving leading to a brain drain that could reduce the territorys 
economic competitiveness 
adding to the territorys headache are the approximately 57000 
vietnamese boat people who have sailed to hong kong seeking asylum 
the squalid camps in which they are housed could erupt in violence 
if the government carries through plans to send most of them back 
to their homeland against their will 
two of the other little dragons taiwan and south korea 
show promise for furthering what mushkat calls the slow and 
painful process of democratic change in asia which has a long 
history of authoritarian rule 
for example the ruling nationalist party is slowly giving up 
its monopoly on political power in taiwan 
democratization shall not move backward in taiwan unless the 
economy collapses or in case of a war neither of which looks very 
likely said lu yali a political commentator at national taiwan 
university 
but taiwan may experience some social instability because of a 
problem also faced by south korea and japan a population that has 
not seen its standard of living increase as quickly as national 
wealth 
property prices have skyrocketed in taiwan and most 
middleclass families have lost all chance of buying their own 
homes crime has increased to the point where sales of luxury 
foreign cars have fallen sharply because businessmen say the 
vehicles make them targets of blackmail 
in japan the average person lives in cramped housing suffers a 
long commute through congested traffic and pays prices 20 percent 
to 30 percent higher than in other industrial nations 
says broadfoot youll see a much greater emphasis on quality 
of life in northeast asia during the 1990s 
in southeast asia the 1990s will begin with a number of thorny 
security issues including the cambodian civil war in which the 
genocidal khmer rouge is among several groups fighting for power 
washington will be negotiating the future of six us military 
bases on the philippines whose lease expires in 1991 many 
influential politicians oppose the bases and there has been some 
indication of growing sentiment in the philippines armed forces 
against the us facilities 
but perhaps the most interesting security question will be what 
tokyo does to protect its growing economic interests in the region 
broadfoot sees japan likely flexing greater military strength 
i dont think the united states will be able to continue to be 
the defense umbrella of asia to the extent that it has been he 
said 
a stronger japanese military will undoubtedly rekindle painful 
memories throughout the region of tokyos efforts to carve a 
subservient great east asia coprosperity sphere during the world 
war ii era 
japan may choose to protect its investment through the use of 
foreign aid designed to promote stability in the region but that 
could help create a zone of influence that also could lead to 
antijapanese sentiment

its tall boxy big and trucklike but in its own way the 
1990 mitsubishi montero 4door rs is as much beauty as beast 
true theres no refined leather interior or woodgrain trim but 
there is lumbering v6 power and decent handling to impress 
there are no comfortmaking frontseat middle armrests the 
steering wheel is large and truckish and the monteros radio is a 
bit of a reach at the bottom of the center dashboard console but 
the montero does offer lots of legroom and headroom thanks to its 
unusually tall profile and it climbs inclines with gusto 
in sum the montero is a substantial serious vehicle with a 
rugged character its not a dressedup pretty face on the road 
that didnt stop motor trend magazine from naming the 1989 
montero 4door the top buy among sport utility vehicles the 
vehicle returns for 1990 virtually unchanged mechanically and in 
design 
among the key attributes of the montero that motor trend noted 
was its interior space at 949 cubic feet of cargo capacity with 
the rear seat folded its the largest of its class 
the magazine wasnt exaggerating the room inside the test 
vehicle was something to behold three adults were comfortable in 
the bench back seat and legroom there was admirable thanks to the 
high perch of the back seat that meant legs were extended mostly 
downward rather than horizontally 
way back in the cargo area i could even sit straight up on the 
carpeted floor with my back against the rear seat and conveniently 
fit my legs inside 
the 434 cubic feet left plenty of room for tailgating and as 
mentioned it could be enlarged to 949 cubic feet if the rear seat 
was folded 
the rear gate swung open sideways not pulling downward even on 
a slight slope the gate opened easily and held not swinging back 
on me 
of course i did have a big step up to get inside because of its 
high ground clearance for offroading 
there also was good passenger visibility thanks to the high 
seating perch in the 744inchhigh montero which is taller than 
competitors isuzu trooper and jeep cherokee 
inside the montero handles seemed to be about everywhere 
especially for rearseat passengers they could grab either of two 
handles by the rear doors to help them scramble up or they could 
use the cutoutstyle headrests on the front seats to help them get 
situated inside 
the montero also had a unique inclinometer in the middle of the 
dashboard it was an encased blue and black ball that rolled in its 
case with the movement of the vehicle when the ball went nearly 
black i knew the vehicle was in a dangerously inclined position 
but dont try to watch the ball as you drive or you may wind up 
off the road as i did mitsubishi notes that the inclinometers 
indicator should be checked when the vehicle is at a standstill 
still just its moving presence on the dash served as a reminder 
that the montero like all sport utility vehicles has a different 
center of gravity than cars do and must be driven with care 
the test vehicle went from twowheel to fourwheeldrive and 
back again with the help of automatic free hubs they automatically 
locked or unlocked the front wheels according to the setting on the

the twodoor montero has been sold in the united states since 
february 1984 but the fourdoor model didnt arrive until august 
1988 spokeswoman debbie stearn said the fourdoor was needed as 
more americans began using sport utilities as station wagons and 
for rural and offroad trips for families 
sales of monteros grew from 2348 in 1984 to 10924 in 1987 
then fell to 8521 in 1988 but in the first 10 months of this 
year sales were up again from 5903 in the januaryoctober period 
in 1988 to 9792 
mitsubishi says the fourdoor montero buyer is typically male 
74 percent and married 88 percent but studies show its not 
unusual for their wives to drive the montero more than they do 
median age of the male buyer is 39 and 66 percent are college 
graduates the company says 
average family income is 75500 and 40 percent are in 
professional and technical jobs an additional 15 percent are 
managers

nine years after the aids epidemic began a 
sluggish us government is quickening its response perhaps the 
most visible sign is the relatively rapid approval given to new 
aids drugs this year one reason for this is the grassroots 
activism prodding the government to change the way it does business

larry kramers sunlit booklined apartment 
overlooks leafy washington square the heart of greenwich village 
inside are two desks one for kramer the writer another for kramer 
the activist 
the second desk covered with scientific reports news clippings 
and government memorandums is where kramer plots his battles 
against drug companies and the food and drug administration urging 
them to move faster to combat aids 
kramer is a playwright novelist and journalist and the founder 
of the aids coalition to unleash power or act up a highly visible 
advocacy group through act up he has staged angry demonstrations 
like one that delayed the opening of the fifth international 
conference on aids in montreal last june 
kramer also writes fiercely eloquent newspaper columns inciting 
aids patients to fight for better care and attacking the fdas 
delays in approving new drugs 
i dont think anyone can understand what its like being a gay 
man in a big city kramer said in an interview its like 
wartime im fighting for lives and im fighting for my own 
life kramer lost his lover to aids in 1984 and is himself 
infected with the virus although he isnt visibly ill 
kramer and his allies have become wellknown for shouting and 
picketing they are less known for their behindthescenes pursuit 
of reforms for two years they have studied the fda learning its 
rules and probing its secrets with the freedom of information act 
now they are beginning to change it before we just 
protested kramer said now we have plans 
after years of blind anger kramer and likeminded activists 
across the country have become adept at persuading the fda and the 
pharmaceutical industry to respond to their concerns 
the needs of the patient community are the most extreme and 
desperate kramer said the laws that bind the fda are the most 
extreme and inhumanely lengthy 
as of the end of october the federal centers for disease 
control had reports of 112241 cases of aids and 66493 deaths 
with such a toll you simply cant do businessasusual studies 
that take 10 years kramer said 
thousands more will die unless the fdas protectionatallcosts 
system for investigating new drugs is changed and potentially 
lifesaving treatments are more rapidly approved kramer asserts 
and even those who can obtain experimental drugs may find they 
cant afford them health insurance covers only drugs approved by 
the fda 
activists argue that desperate patients should have the right to 
choose what drugs to try 
i think right now we are seeing a major shift in the federal 
health establishment from attempting to protect people to 
realizing there are circumstances under which people should be 
allowed to take risks said james eigo of act ups treatment and 
data committee 
several recent events highlight the change in attitude at the 
fda 
in june dr anthony fauci head of the federal aids research 
effort announced he would push for an experimental system under 
which the fda would continue controlled studies of promising new 
drugs but also make the drugs more widely available to patients who 
cannot get into the experimental trials this is now referred to as 
the parallel track approach 
parallel track was our idea two years ago said eigo he is 
now a member of a federal committee appointed to oversee the new 
process 
in july federal health officials met with aids activists to 
discuss how government research might benefit from underground drug 
trials organized by the activists the meeting was a high point in 
cooperation between the activists and government 
this is like a dream dr donald abrams of san francisco 
general hospital said last summer i dont think any of us could 
have envisioned it 
in september the fda made an experimental drug widely available 
to patients even though parallel tracking had not been formally 
established 
the drug called dideoxyinosine or ddi is still under study to 
determine whether it offers advantages over azt the only approved 
antiaids drug in this country at the same time however the fda 
is allowing drugmaker bristolmyers to dispense it to patients with 
advanced aids or aidsrelated complex who cannot tolerate azt 
some scientists worry that wide distribution of drugs will 
interfere with experimental trials because patients know that in 
controlled trials they might get placebos rather than drug doses 
federal officials say it is too soon to know how serious the 
potential problem is 
even with release of ddi however activists have not eased up 
continuing their pressure on american drug companies by threatening 
to buy drugs overseas if they cant get them in the united states 
if bristolmyers had not made ddi available for example 
activists could have bought it from underground labs kramer said 
the company was about to lose a big market if they didnt get the 
drug out he said 
activists in new york san francisco and other cities have 
established buying groups that travel to other countries where 
aids drugs banned in this country are freely available or less 
expensive 
in one important case activists protested the high cost of a 
drug called pentamidine used to prevent and treat pneumocystis 
carinii pneumonia one of the deadliest of aidsrelated infections 
they threatened to buy the drug in england where a monthly dose 
can be bought for less than half of the 9954 wholesale price 
charged by its american maker lyphomed inc of rosemone ill the 
company compromised insisting on keeping its wholesale price but 
agreeing to provide the drug free to uninsured aids patients

as snow begins to fall and the sky turns gray 
soviet citizens enter a long winter of discontent over barren store 
shelves strikes and ethnic clashes that far from being halted by 
president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms often have worsened 
theres much that wed like to have but the russian people 
are used to difficulties said luda panina 33 as she sold red 
carnations outside a moscow subway station on a cold snowy day 
russians and the soviet unions more than 100 other national 
groups have endured hardships for decades but the difference is 
that now they expect more both from gorbachev and from his 
perestroika program that 4 years ago promised to make their lives 
better 
preparing for his shipboard summit with president bush in the 
mediterranean sea this weekend gorbachev indicated a principal 
goal of the talks would be to discuss easing of international 
tensions so that he could focus more on problems at home to put 
it in a nutshell we need a normal external environment 
for our domestic work he said 
the country has been torn by longsimmering ethnic economic and 
environmental woes that the leadership previously ignored or 
stifled but which have surfaced as glasnost or openness 
exposes harsh realities 
inflation crime and budget deficits around for decades were 
hushed up until glasnost brought out the shocking numbers crime up 
34 percent in the first 10 months of 1989 over the same period last 
year a budget deficit reaching 120 billion rubles 194 billion 
inflation pegged by one economist at 4 percent to 5 percent yearly 
ethnic tensions among the myriad soviet peoples many of whom 
were brutally oppressed under dictator josef stalin have pitted 
armenians against azerbaijanis ethnic turks against uzbeks and 
russian minorities against estonians latvians lithuanians 
ukrainians and moldavians ethnic clashes have taken more than 300 
lives by official count 
in addition growing campaigns for independence in many of the 
15 constituent soviet republics especially in the baltics are 
threatening the very glue that holds the union together 
strikes by coal miners angry about official inattention to 
their hazardous work conditions and poor lifestyles have depleted 
fuel supplies going into the winter 
in the southern republic of georgia the government ordered 
businesses to switch days off to wednesdays and thursdays because 
of an electricity shortage caused in part by the shutdown of 
armenias nuclear power plant after last years devastating 
earthquake 
outright economic sabotage is afoot as well azerbaijan 
blockaded the ethnic hotspot of nagornokarabakh and neighboring 
armenia for two months preventing trainloads of fuel food and raw 
materials from getting through the blockade delayed reconstruction 
of the area leveled by the dec 7 1988 earthquake that killed 
25000 armenians officials now say rebuilding will take three 
years one more than planned 
other headaches the nation and gorbachev have suffered include 
the 1986 chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion and fire that 
according to one soviet newspaper led to the deaths of 250 people 
and cost billions of rubles a gas pipeline blast in june that 
killed more than 600 passengers on passing trains and extensive 
water and air pollution 
to many soviets however their mood depends largely on what 
there is to eat and wear 
for the most part gorbachevs reforms have brought not 
improvements in soviets standard of living but more of what 
people here call deficits shortages of products that have led 
to the widespread rationing of butter cheese meat sugar and tea 
some economists even propose rationing everything to prevent the 
hoarding that is now common 
as soviets approach the end of the year many would agree with a 
prediction made months ago 
one can expect that the year 1989 will be the most 
unsuccessful of all those we have lived through vasily selyunin 
a specialist in economic affairs wrote in april 
statistics tell the 287 million soviets what they already know 
from painful experience 
of 211 food products a consumer demand institute found only 23 
could be bought freely the rest require connections with the 
sellers or overpayment or they are rationed 
soviets eat half the meat and fruit consumed by the average 
american but twice as many potatoes 
because of losses in distribution and processing onequarter 
of all farm products dont reach consumers 
nearly 80 percent of muscovites buy up items in short supply 
even though they dont really need them at the time and there is 
unsatisfied consumer demand in the capital worth the equivalent of 
14 million to 16 billion a research institute estimates 
gorbachev now speaks openly about the failures of perestroika 
and has increasingly expressed worry over the peoples mood 
the shortage of food creates social tension and generates not 
merely criticism but actual discontent he told the communist 
party central committee in march 
yuri maslyukov the state planning chief also has spoken of 
mounting social discontent 
gorbachev and his aides admit they failed initially to pay 
enough attention to the peoples welfare and say improving it is 
now their no 1 priority 
all of our productive capacity must be reoriented to produce 
what the people need consumer goods the soviet leader said in 
may 
to that end some 300 military factories are being converted to 
civilian production and the 1990 government budget calls for 
increasing consumer goods output by 12 percent 
the kremlin also is turning to other countries for quick fixes 
it plans to use its precious reserves of foreign currency and 
western credits to import 518 billion worth of consumer goods 
next year 
to help soviet industry gear up to produce such goods on its 
own plans call for importing 26 billion worth of raw materials 
and light industry equipment 
this year the government brought in 15 million pair of leather 
shoes 12 million pair of warm womens boots 300 million razor 
blades 10 million compact cassette players as well as clothing 
soap detergent and toothpaste contracts were signed with foreign 
companies from turkey to japan 
an encounter with ms panina the flower saleswoman showed the 
imports are reaching the people two large boxes of danish laundry 
detergent she had bought sat on the ground next to her flower 
stand americanbrand toothpaste also has appeared in some moscow 
stores 
but the kremlin cannot afford such costly imports for long and 
western officials say they will not help solve the basic problem 
inadequacy of domestic production 
us aid might take the pressures off for a few months one 
senior western diplomat said but later the shelves would still 
be bare 
gorbachev has said the socioeconomic situation must be 
righted within a year and a half at most but one of his chief 
economic advisers abel aganbegyan says it will take twice that 
long to end shortages politburo member yegor k ligachev estimates 
it will take until 1996 to bring soviets diet up to nutritional 
norms 
in the meantime soviets keep scrounging around 
you must run around to stores to buy what you need said ms 
panina a look of wonderment on her face she added they say in 
america you go to one store and buy all you want

in a display of bipartisanship with a 
vengeance republican and democratic senators are feuding with the 
white house over the senatorial prerogative of saying who should be 
appointed a federal judge back home 
the administration is trying to enforce a multiple choice system 
instead of letting gop senators pick names for almost automatic 
nomination to federal district judgeships that has angered 
republicans gained them democratic allies and set the lines for a 
confrontation after congress reconvenes on jan 23 unless the 
dispute can be settled first 
it is said that marriages are made in heaven but judgeships 
are made in the senate a democratic senator declared applauding 
a republican colleague for challenging the republican white house 
on the matter 
attorney general dick thornburgh said wednesday that president 
bush wants a pool of suitable candidates from which he can choose 
his nominee and govern the process himself he said if senators 
wont accept those terms thats a matter between them and the 
president 
on this one the lines are institutional not political senators 
dont have much in the way of patronage and they are not about to 
let go of the judgeships on which they have claimed selection 
rights for 150 years and more 
the case at issue involves the appointment of a federal district 
court judge for vermont sen james m jeffords rvt has been 
trying all year to get fred i parker of weybridge nominated to 
fill the vacancy 
the dispute erupted into debate just before congress adjourned 
10 days ago because of it jeffords held up the confirmation of 
federal judges in alabama and arkansas and said he will block 
nominations wholesale next year if necessary 
the senate republican conference sided with him and told 
president bush that he ought to nominate jeffords choice 
jeffords said district court judgeships have been the 
prerogative of senators since 1840 a tradition so strong that 
president herbert hoover once nominated a man he didnt want 
because a senator insisted and then sent administration aides to 
lobby unsuccessfully against confirmation 
that tradition has been whittled a bit during the past two 
administrations jimmy carter had selection panels look at all 
nominees and required that there be more women and minority 
nominees while he bent the old system he did not break it 
ronald reagan had a review commission and his administration 
required that senators send the justice department three names for 
each vacancy instead of just one but republican senators left no 
doubt about which name counted and they got their way 
jeffords said the reagan changes didnt really interfere with 
senate prerogatives what formerly was a formality is now a 
reality jeffords said it is the policy of this administration 
that any senator must send at least three names and it also has 
been made clear to me personally that they are not restricted to 
those names to select from bending to the administration 
jeffords did supply two more names but made clear that parkers 
was the only one acceptable to him 
jeffords said the names go to a review panel of five 
bureaucrats somewhere in the bowels of the justice department 
if they as in my case decide that that candidate is 
unacceptable that is the end of the process he said 
thats why he decided to fight using another senate prerogative 
to block other nominees 
in vermont jeffords said a ninemember bipartisan panel 
reviews candidates for the federal bench he said parker was rated 
the best of a dozen potential nominees far ahead of any other and 
he insisted the state selection board is better equipped than the 
administration to choose the best judge for vermont 
jeffords told the senate that if he yields on parker every 
other senator will be at risk when it comes time to fill a federal 
court vacancy 
sen patrick j leahy dvt agreed with jeffords on the system 
and on the selection of parker whom he called the best possible 
choice he said judgeships should continue to be made in the senate 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of the judiciary 
committee said theres more at stake than an ancient prerogative 
unlike five bureaucrats in the white house subjecting nominees to 
litmus tests or any other tests the home state senators know 
better the quality of the people in their states biden said 
jeffords a senate freshman has ventured no public guess as to 
why the administration is making his choice a test case parker 
who practices law in middlebury and burlington was an assistant 
attorney general when jeffords served as state attorney general 
murray dickman an aide to thornburgh has cited parkers 
membership in the allmale ethan allen club of burlington parker 
resigned from the club before his name was recommended for the 
bench 
dickman noted that leahy once complained to thornburgh about the 
membership of another judicial nominee in an allmale club the 
nomination of vaughn r walker of san francisco was held up for 
nearly two years and finally approved this month 
theres not much political logic there walker also was 
sponsored by a republican senator and two republican 
administrations stuck with him democratic opposition and club 
affiliations notwithstanding

congress is on the threshold of enacting one 
of the most farreaching pieces of civil rights legislation ever 
addressing one of the nations largest and disparate minorities 
the disabled 
the americans with disabilities act guarantees the nations 43 
million deaf blind lame and otherwise infirm people against job 
discrimination assuring them access to transportation as well as 
shopping malls doctors offices restaurants movies and other 
public accommodations 
an entire section guarantees the nations 24 million 
hearingimpaired and 3 million speechimpaired residents access to 
telephone service 
the legislation also says the 15 million americans infected 
with the aids virus can be treated no differently from anyone with 
any other illness or disability such as multiple sclerosis or 
cancer 
this is one of the best steps forward that we can take to 
fight the aids epidemic sen paul simon dill told fellow 
senators 
further the bill declares that alcoholism and drug addiction 
are medical problems rather than signs of moral turpitude 
protecting people who are trying to overcome their addictions the 
bill also extends new protections to those suffering from mental 
illness mental retardation and learning disabilities 
opposition has come primarily from small business groups worried 
about the cost and complication of compliance and from a small but 
vocal group of lawmakers opposed to new legal protection for aids 
victims 
house debate is likely to be heated over the aids provisions and 
the question of precisely how much protection the bill affords 
victims of the disease 
but with more than 200 sponsors in the house the support of the 
bush administration and backing from more than 200 civil rights and 
other advocacy groups the overall bill is likely to pass 
substantially unchanged 
the senate passed the measure 768 on sept 7 and four house 
committees are going through its provisions before a floor vote 
likely to send the bill to president bush for his signature 
in senate debate proponents likened it to the civil rights act 
of 1964 which prohibited racial or religious discrimination some 
turned the clock back further to the freeing of the slaves 
sen tom harkin diowa one of the measures chief sponsors 
calls it a 20th century emancipation proclamation for people with 
disabilities 
business groups however remain skeptical the national 
federation of independent business claims its 570000 members 
mainly small business owners will bear the largest burden with 
nothing offered in return 
the federation and the us chamber of commerce also complain 
that the legislation is so vague that the only ones guaranteed 
employment will be lawyers 
lawyers following up on the bills provisions could achieve 
results from courts that perhaps are not in accordance with the 
manner in which congress intended the statute says chamber 
attorney zachary fasman 
no one has come up with a privatesector price tag supporters 
talk instead about the economic benefits of putting the disabled 
into the economic mainstream they say the bill will lead to fewer 
government support payments more consumers and more taxpayers 
the numbers 82 million disabled americans who wanted to work 
were unemployed in 1986 and half had household incomes of 15000 
or less transfer payments to the disabled are reaching nearly 60 
billion a year institutionalization costs 200 a day per patient 
behind those numbers lie tales of suffering and humiliation 
the foster mother of a deceased aids victim in maryland who 
went to more than two dozen funeral homes before finding one that 
would prepare the body the kentucky woman who was dismissed from a 
job because her aidsstricken son moved back home 
the blind harvard law school graduate who wrote to 600 
corporations three times over without receiving a single job offer 
the new jersey zookeeper who kept children with downs syndrome 
away from the primate cage for fear they might upset the chimps 
the college that refused to hire a severely arthritic woman 
because trustees thought normal students shouldnt see her 
the paralyzed vietnam veteran who must use the service entrance 
to restaurants because the regular doorways are too narrow for his 
wheelchair 
the paraplegic who cant go out on the spur of the moment with 
nondisabled friends because the transit bus lacks a wheelchair 
lift and the special van must be scheduled a day in advance 
the rural elderly person who cant afford an airline ticket 
but cant ride a less expensive bus because it has no lift 
or in one of the frequent cases of benign discrimination 
the blind person who wants to wait his turn in line at the national 
aquarium but is told he must use the handicapped entrance 
if the bills spirit recalls the emancipation proclamation its 
letter comes out of the word processors of the federal bureaucracy 
the legislation borrows from the 1964 civil rights act and 
sections of the rehabilitation act of 1973 dealing with companies 
institutions and groups that receive government money 
rather than list specific disabilities estimated by some to be 
about 900 the law defines disability as a physical or mental 
impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life 
activities 
disabled individuals must be hired if they are qualified to do 
the essential functions of a job 
still exceptions likely fodder for future legal tests 
abound the disabled need not be hired if that poses an undue 
hardship existing public accommodations must be made accessible 
as long as the changes are readily achievable without creating 
an undue financial burden 
debate has focused on the cost and extent of accommodations 
with supporters arguing that most will involve relatively little 
expense widening a door might cost 300 relay services for the 
deaf and speechimpaired would add about 120 a year to each 
customers telephone bill 
but sen gordon humphrey rnh argues that the annual cost of 
a signlanguage interpreter can reach 23500 a reader would have 
to be hired for a blind executive or accountant forcing employers 
to hire two people for one job computers with speech synthesizers 
and special software for the blind can easily cost 5000 he says 
the bus industry estimates the cost of lifts at 35000 each 
not to mention the lost seats and lost cargo space for package 
express proponents say new stateoftheart models are now 
available for 11000 
sen warren rudman rnh says he is troubled by the lack of 
discretion allowed employers when dealing with an addict even if 
that person is now clean 
it is difficult for a person to develop an addiction to 
illegal drugs without first making a conscious decision to break 
the law rudman says

the prospect of outfitting public buses to accept 
wheelchairs as the pending americans with disabilities act would 
require troubles many transit officials they say wheelchair lifts 
are expensive unreliable and a nuisance to normal riders 
but in seattle where the metro system started putting lifts on 
buses 10 years ago and now has them on 75 percent of its 1000bus 
fleet its hard to see what all the fuss is about 
this city is a leader in making its bus system accessible to 
lame deaf blind and mentally disabled riders it even gets fan 
mail a wheelchairbound couple from chicago recently wrote to say 
they honeymooned in seattle because they knew theyd be able to get 
around 
the difference here was that we planned it to succeed rather 
than to fail said metro official bob carroll the attitude in 
seattle has been that accessibility is worth the cost 
the cost to the system is high 389 per trip for wheelchair 
passengers compared to 2 per regular ride taxpayers bear the 
brunt of it disabled riders pay just 25 cents per trip less than 
half the lowest regular fare of 55 cents 
but carroll thinks the price is reasonable paralyzed from the 
waist down by a diving accident 15 years ago he says the citys 
wheelchair lifts have opened doors once closed to him and other 
disabled residents 
its being told youre part of the system versus youre 
a pain in the neck carroll said one recent afternoon as he 
waited at a downtown bus stop 
a bus soon eased to a halt and other passengers hurried on 
seeing carrolls wheelchair the driver pushed a button with the 
whine of an electric motor a metal platform slid out from under 
the front steps 
carroll rolled onto the hydraulic lift which then rose up and 
over the steps settling on the floor inside as the lift reversed 
itself and slid back out of sight carroll wheeled down the aisle 
and with the drivers help strapped his wheelchair into a 
reserved space 
the driver was courteous some passengers on the crowded bus had 
to pull their feet back to let carroll pass but nobody grumbled 
and the whole operation took 45 seconds 
when seattle started its program critics held up the failures 
of new york philadelphia and st louis which had been plagued by 
lifts malfunctioning up to 70 percent of the time uncooperative 
bus drivers and disabled people afraid to use the system 
i was told the bus drivers union would fight it said 
bj carol who started metros program in 1978 and now is a 
private transportation consultant i was told there would be a 
huge backlash from nondisabled persons refusing to ride with 
disabled passengers 
metro headed off problems by aggressively marketing its new 
program liftequipped buses visited nursing homes for practice 
sessions officials asked riders for advice and followed it 
they augmented wheelchairaccessible buses with paratransit 
vans available on a reservation basis for people too disabled to 
use buses 
perhaps most importantly they maintained their equipment 
nationwide wheelchair lifts break down an average 10 percent of 
the time an unacceptable rate for riders depending on the bus to 
get to work metro official rick walsh said seattles malfunction 
rate hovers around 1 percent he said 
even here disabled passengers are still a tiny minority they 
account for about 380 rides a day less than 1 percent of the 
systems total ridership 
it would be more costeffective to tell them go jump in the 
lake were not going to serve you at all said carol 
but that too would have a price you can support disabled 
people in a warehouse situation or you can get them in the 
mainstream with a job paying taxes carol said overall its 
costeffective to let people work because thats what they want to 
do

for 38 years the government has exploded 
nuclear weapons at the nevada test site bombs have been dropped 
from airplanes and exploded atop tall towers theyve been buried 
deep underground and in tunnels at least one was launched with an 
airtoair rocket 
in every one of 697 announced tests theres been one constant 
theyve always gone off said paul brown head of the 
defense systems arms control office at lawrence livermore national 
laboratory sometimes the yields havent been what we expected 
but theyve always gone off 
given that nearly perfect track record why does the government 
continue spending some 500 million a year to test its nuclear 
weapons 
reliability is one reason but its only one brown said 
we see a need to modernize our weapons in response to a changing 
world and theres a tremendously significant need to improve the 
safety of our current weapons 
that view is challenged by a senior physicist at lawrence 
livermore where nuclear weapons are designed ray kidder a 
30year veteran of nuclear weapons research says current weapons 
are both safe and reliable and contends the only reason for 
continued testing is to develop new warheads such as one under 
development that would burrow underground before exploding 
do you want new weapons or not that is really the only 
question said kidder who in a 1987 report to congress refuted 
the reagan administrations contention it needed to test weapons 
from stockpiles to ensure they worked 
kidders fivemonth study found the nuclear stockpile to be 
robust and argued that weapons no longer had to be taken off the 
shelf to be tested 
with the exception of a few of the management people in the 
complex here i think almost everyone agrees with that now he 
said almost anybody that doesnt have an institutional reason 
for it pretty much agrees you can maintain a stockpile for 
deterrence forever without new testing 
nuclear weapons have a shelf life of only about 20 years before 
they start deteriorating but kidder argued in his study that 
scientists would be able to manufacture new ones based on old 
designs without the need for new testing 
i think he underestimates the difficulty of remanufacturing 
these weapons brown said weve tried to remanufacture things 
and there have been problems that surprised us at the time 
because of changes in materials and the difficulty of following the 
old old designs 
older weapons are still being tested but much of the current 
program involves new ones he said there are new systems being 
developed at the request of the air force army and navy 
right now were working on a shortrange attack missile with 
advanced security features that will help penetrate air defenses 
without testing he said designers wouldnt have the confidence 
to make new warheads for new weapons an example is the 
airlaunched cruise missiles which needed a new warhead we did a 
test in the 1980s at low temperatures that failed to meet 
expectations and we had to make a correction 
scientists no longer carry on the breakneck testing schedule 
that at one point saw an average two detonations a week in 1962 
an evolving knowledge of nuclear science has seen testing schedules 
reduced to an average of little more than one explosion a month in 
the last decade 
since us testing began with the detonation of the first atomic 
bomb a 15kiloton blast in july 1945 at alamogordo nm 825 us 
nuclear weapons have been detonated 697 of those since testing was 
moved to its current location 
its not just blowing up a bomb in the bottom of the desert 
said nick aquilina who runs the energy departments nuclear 
testing program this is a completely new science its only been 
since 1945 that weve been doing this 
several tests in the last few years were star warsrelated 
brown said and perhaps incongruously some are to see how the 
nations weapons program can operate if there were a ussoviet 
agreement limiting the size of explosions 
a fairly significant part of our program is devoted to how we 
can accomplish our mission under further test limitations he 
said were trying to determine what we might be able to 
accomplish at lower thresholds 
congress last year asked federal agencies and laboratories to 
study how a test ban treaty with the soviet union would affect us 
nuclear capabilities 
the governments position is that it is taking a stepwise 
approach to a ban brown said were doing the research aimed 
at developing the technical base for the government to make its 
decisions 
current nuclear tests are restricted to no more than 150 
kilotons the explosive equivalent of 150000 tons of tnt the 
limit was set in a 1974 treaty never ratified by congress the 
united states and soviet union agreed to a test ban in november 
1958 that ended in september 1961 with the soviets decision to 
resume testing the united states is on record as wanting to agree 
to lower limits before it will negotiate a test ban brown said 
the two nations made history last year when nuclear scientists 
from each witnessed a test at the others secret site soviet 
scientists witnessed a test at the nevada site in august 1988 
american scientists went to the soviet site at semipalatinsk the 
following month the tests were aimed at finding a verification 
method for future limitations on nuclear tests 
kidder though said those in the nuclear weapons industry are 
proceeding slowly with any preparations for a possible test ban 
the pronuclear forces in this business dont want to be ready 
for a test ban he said they simply feel the best way to avoid 
one is to be unprepared for it 
at the site itself where 5500 people work in an area the size 
of rhode island theres not anything as organized as a 
contingency plan to mothball the test site aquilina said we 
dont have a specific plan for that

as an episcopal priest bob nelson prays that 
no one will ever use what he helps to produce at his day job 
other priests may lead protests against nuclear weapons nelson 
leads the teams that explode those weapons deep underground at the 
nevada test site its contradictory being the only priest i 
know who fires nuclear weapons 
and it forces him almost daily to reconcile his occupation and 
his calling 
there are no right or wrong answers he said i would like 
to be in a situation where there are no nuclear weapons but i 
would also like a situation where we maintain the system of freedom 
and justice we have in our country 
the 48yearold deputy manager of nevada operations for the us 
energy department is a nuclear veteran having begun his career in 
the navy on the staff of adm hyman rickover a force behind 
nuclear development 
hes a newcomer to the clergy however having for years put 
aside his thoughts of becoming a priest the way god works he 
just doesnt follow the rules at all with my family work and 
other commitments i thought becoming a priest was something that 
just couldnt happen said the father of two 
nelson a lifelong episcopalian was nominated into the 
priesthood by the congregation at all saints episcopal church under 
a canon allowing elevation of parishioners to priests in remote 
parishes he was ordained two years ago the church has not taken a 
position on continued nuclear testing 
nelson takes pains to separate his role as a priest from the job 
in which he has given the final approval to detonate more than 30 
nuclear devices but he also believes his experience in the weapons 
program has given him insight into the everyday world that is 
useful in his role as a priest 
i deal with a lot of real world things here that perhaps the 
clergy who have been clergy for their whole careers dont see he 
said 
nelson doesnt shy away from defending his beliefs on continued 
nuclear testing and he is often asked to go before antinuclear 
groups and explain the governments position that testing is vital 
to the nations security 
i dont think in any of these discussions i change anybodys 
mind or they change mine but we come away from honest and direct 
discussions the better for it the best comment i ever got from one 
antinuclear activist was i dont agree with what youre doing 
but im glad youre the one doing it 
hes the kind of guy i admire and respect whether he worked 
for me or was on the other side said nick aquilina manager of 
the test site i believe he comes across in a very credible way 
because hes so honest ive never secondguessed his motives on 
anything because hes always so honest 
nelson goes out of his way not to criticize antinuclear 
protesters who often congregate at the gates of the test site 
many in fact are his friends including the wife of another 
episcopal priest in las vegas 
nelson and the priests wife are founding board members and work 
closely together on a project to build a shelter for homeless women 
and children in the city we just dont talk about nuclear 
weapons when were working together she and i have the same 
ultimate aim wed both like not to have nuclear weapons the 
difference is how we get there

andrew rivers is a bright witty 10yearold 
whose 2foot11inch frame is so brittle he breaks like a china 
doll 
he will never be a joe namath an albert einstein maybe we 
take things one day at a time said mary rivers whose son has 
osteogenesis imperfecta a relatively rare genetic bone disorder 
for which science has no cure 
its caused more than 30 fractures so far stunted andrews 
growth and left him confined to a wheelchair doctors dont know if 
hell ever walk 
at the moment there are really no good medical therapies that 
make a difference long term says dr peter byers a seattle 
medical geneticist who specializes in inherited diseases including 
osteogenesis imperfecta 
for the short term surgeons put metal rods through the bones in 
andrews deformed legs to strengthen them rodding exercise and 
external splinting seem to be the best that medicine has to offer 
oi patients 
an estimated 20000 to 25000 americans suffer from the disease 
which is a lack of collagen or protein in the bone it is either 
inherited or caused by some mutation in a gene oi patients often 
have triangular heads and barrel chests that can lead to pulmonary 
and spinal problems 
andrew has a 7yearold buddy alex metcalf who also suffers 
from oi the two match wits at computer games or sit giggling on 
the living room carpet as they bat a sponge ball around in a fast 
game of catch the diehard football fans cheer the tampa bay 
buccaneers from the sidelines during home games 
alex was born with three breaks and four shortened bones 
basically we were told to handle this child as fine 
crystal said his father matt metcalf but youve got to 
assess the risk take precautions then let them go out and play 
despite the outcome the interaction is important 
sometimes just twisting during sleep can break a childs limb 
picking up a baby up can fracture the frail bones often parents 
sandwich newborns between pieces of foam for support to turn the 
child over or change a diaper 
andrew broke an arm while asleep his right leg at six months 
his left leg the month after 
here we have all this attention on child abuse and im 
carrying around this little body with all these casts said mrs 
rivers i was ready to get a tshirt that read i have brittle 
bones 
at lake fern montessori academy where andrew is a fifthgrader 
principal nettie rossi credits mary and conrad rivers for their 
sons academic and social achievements theyre so supportive 
they explain things prepare him then let him go out and do what 
he has to do they dont baby him 
as a result andrew plays ball from his wheelchair and does 
pushups with his class of 27 he has a really good outlook im 
sure he has his moments but they dont show here mrs rossi 
said he has a sense of hummor is bright a good 
conversationalist and just an allaround good guy the kids treat 
him like one of them 
oi can be so severe it claims a child at birth or so mild a 
person may only show the telltale blue sclerae a blue color to 
the whites of the eyes and suffer a few dozen fractures over a 
lifetime 
some clearly have a shortened life span they get curvature of 
the spine or suffer compressed lungs making the heart and lungs 
work harder others have a near normal life byers said 
its devastating news at birth that your child has a 
mindboggling disease said bob phillips 42 an accountant with 
a mild case of oi who is director of accounting for the shriners 
and treasurer of the osteogenesis imperfecta foundation inc both 
headquartered in tampa 
the foundation formed as a volunteer organization in 1970 in 
november 1987 members decided to organize and centralize to offer 
support help collect information about the disease and share it 
with other patients and with members of the medical profession 
phillips 4foot10 and ambulatory said he stopped counting 
bone breaks after more than 90 during his growing years adding 
we do break easy but we seem to heal faster and thats a plus

wouldbe super athletes who take on 
projects like bicycling across the country are psychologically 
pretty much like the rest of us but may offer some clues on 
handling daily stress researchers say 
we look at sports as a way to look at other things in life 
that are harder to study said james whelan a memphis state 
university psychologist and part of a team studying riders in the 
annual race across america 
even though they voluntarily take on the grueling challenge 
riders arent psychologically unusual said andrew myers the study 
director we thought wed find that they were all crazy but the 
data just doesnt support that 
the racers ride for 10 days with one to two hours of sleep a 
night conditions producing what whelan and myers say produces a 
unique source of study subjects under extreme physical and 
emotional stress 
these people reported some rather serious psychological 
disturbances during the race whelan said there were 
perceptual distortions 
for example they would see trees get up and move which they 
knew wasnt happening and it was bizarre to them a fair number at 
different times during the race would actually hallucinate theyd 
see dragons coming out of the woods for some riders their ability 
to see the world around them was so impaired they had to stop 
riding for a period of time 
the researchers still are evaluating data from the 1988 and 1989 
races but whelan said some factors already stand out on dealing 
with stress riders who could concentrate on the task set and 
achieve reasonable interim goals and rely emotionally on their 
support teams generally came out best 
among those who finished the race we found that their skills 
in concentration and mental preparation and motivation mediated 
their emotional deterioration he said what were talking 
about here is not just are they more motivated but do they have the 
skills to keep themselves motivated you can be real motivated at 
the start but 1500 miles into the race when youre hitting 
100degree days how do you keep yourself into what youre doing 
the racers learned the needed skills through years of training 
and competition but they can be taught to nonathletes in 
particular how they plan for something how concentrated they are 
on the task how well theyre able to keep themselves motivated 
how well theyre able to deal with anxieties and worries and their 
ability to depend on others for support and encouragement he 
said 
riders participating in the study filled out questionnaires at 
the beginning and end of the races and also were questioned at 
various stages along the 3000mile route research assistants 
conducted the inrace surveys hanging out the window of a chase 
van as one would expect they found that the mood of the riders 
deteriorated dramatically as the race wore on twentysix of the 34 
riders in 1988 took part in the study and 20 of the 27 riders in 
1989 
people just get involved in seeing how far they can ride and 
this is an ultimate challenge whelan said theyre pretty 
normal folks who become focused on this sort of activity they 
dream about whether they can cross the country and how fast they 
can do it but theyre no different from any other sort of athlete 
or other people who enter a hobby and become really involved in 
it

small doses of a toxin that causes food 
poisoning can help people with a condition that strangles their 
voices researchers say 
injections of botulinum into the vocal cords of people with 
spasmodic dysphonia relax the tightly squeezed cords within days 
said dr robert miller chairman of tulane medical centers 
department of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery the only 
adverse reactions are brief hoarseness and difficulty swallowing 
and the toxin does not spread to the rest of the body 
spasmodic dysphonia is uncommon but reliable estimates are not 
available of the number of people affected it seems to worsen with 
stress and was long thought to be psychosomatic but evidence has 
accumulated linking the problem to nerve disorders such as tics and 
other uncontrollable movements 
injections of botulinum toxin have been used to treat facial 
tics miller said so researchers decided to try it against the 
vocal cord disorder work is also being done in new york san 
diego houston and at the national institutes of health said dr 
joseph jankovic a baylor college of medicine neurologist 
the treatment does not cure the condition the shots costing 
about 300 each must be repeated every few months 
the toxin works with the vocal cords for much the same reason it 
causes food poisoning jankovic said in each case it binds to the 
synapse and blocks release of acetylcholine a chemical that helps 
transmit nerve impulses in the case of food poisoning the nervous 
systems control over breathing often is disrupted causing death 
by respiratory paralysis he said

researchers are eavesdropping on the most 
private intimate moments in the lives of hogs hoping for hints 
that will help farmers 
were not trying to talk to the animals what were doing is 
listening to the animals and seeing what they have to tell us 
said jim deshazer who has established that hogs make different 
sounds identifiable with greeting humans romancing mating 
partners hunger stress and other conditions 
in a more subtle distinction sound and signalanalysis 
equipment has helped determine that there is a single peak to a 
sound wave emitted by a sow during nursing and a double peak to the 
sound while giving birth 
even though its not picked up by hearing instruments and 
maybe other animals can pick it up said deshazer an 
agricultural engineering professor at the university of 
nebraskalincoln whose research has drawn on the talents of 
psychologists speech clinicians and even dentists 
differentiating hog sounds could have practical applications 
microphones and soundmeasuring devices could summon a farmer to 
help when a sow is giving birth for example or could identify 
sounds inaudible to humans that might be stressful to hogs like a 
squeaking ventilator fan he said 
such equipment allows us to pick up sounds animals make and to 
analyze those sounds that tell us theres some stress problems or 
other indicators that need to be taken care of or that things seem 
to be all right

the savoy hotel an uppercrust british 
institution has won an eightyear legal battle to fend off a 
takeover by trusthouse forte plc a giant hotel and catering chain 
founded by an italian immigrant 
lord forte who powered trusthouse on the back of a single 
london milkdrinks counter he opened in the 1930s called off the 
fight wednesday because he was not willing to spend large sums of 
money in legal fees an aide said 
trusthouse said it would not buy any more shares in savoy hotel 
plc for five years and the savoy said it would not issue any more 
shares for five years without trusthouse approval 
after spending about 64 million trusthouse owns 69 percent of 
savoy shares but controls only 423 percent because of the stocks 
voting structure forte employed a team of lawyers in an 
unsuccessful bid to gain more votes 
in return for the truce the savoy offered seats on its board to 
rocco forte lord fortes son and trusthouse chief executive and 
to trusthouse financial director donald main 
but savoy manging director giles shepard said he will continue 
to have final say in the savoys operations he estimated that 
fending off the takeover had cost the savoy at least 156 million 
in legal fees 
we are delighted to have come to this agreement with the 
savoy rocco forte said we have always recognized the 
excellence of the savoys hotels built in 1889 the savoy runs 
separate kitchens on each of its seven floors keeps count of its 
famous guests tastes throughout their lives and decorates its 300 
rooms individually so that no two are identical 
the company also operates other famous hotels claridges the 
connaught the berkeley and the hotel lancaster in paris royalty 
stays at claridges and the superpowers hold banquets there when 
their leaders come to london 
trusthouse claims to be the worlds most profitable hotel and 
catering chain and looks after entertaining at the 10 downing 
street residence of prime minister margaret thatcher who admires 
its entrepreneurship 
sir hugh wontner chairman of the company that owns the savoy 
and a former lord mayor of london has been catering adviser to 
buckingham palace for more than 50 years and his family controls 10 
percent of the savoy shares 
wontner said quality comes before profit lord forte said they 
go handinhand 
trusthouse operates in more than 40 countries and lord forte 
once said the savoys profits could be doubled in one year if its

us corporations aftertax profits fell for 
the third straight quarter in a sharp 72 percent decline 
attributed largely to losses stemming from hurricane hugo the 
government said 
the commerce department said wednesday the drop followed an 
identical fall in the second quarter which was the steepest in 
three years and a 11 percent decline in the first quarter 
the changes left aftertax profits at an annual rate of 1495 
billion in the july to september period 
a broader measure beforetax profits adjusted for depreciation 
and inventories decreased at an annual rate of 155 billion to 
2923 billion but 11 billion of that was attributed to 
hurricanerelated losses 9 billion from payouts by insurance 
companies and 2 billion from uninsured losses 
analysts also attributed the poor showing to firms inability to 
raise prices to compensate for rising labor costs and to slower 
growth in export sales exports are being hurt by the strong 
dollar which makes us goods more expensive on overseas markets 
the problem is very basic labor costs are rising and prices 
are not going up fast enough to cover the increase said 
economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch amp co 
analysts said the profit squeeze likely will continue consumer 
resistance caused by a softening economy as well as stiff 
competition from overseas firms will make it difficult for us 
companies to raise prices 
economist david wyss of drimcgraw hill inc a lexington 
mass forecasting firm said fourthquarter profits also will be 
depressed by a strike at the boeing co and from insurance losses 
attributable to the san francisco earthquake 
a likely result of lower profits will be weaker investment 
spending by businesses a bright spot in previous quarters 
business capital spending grew at an annual rate of 46 percent 
in the third quarter down from a previous estimate of 58 percent 
and sharply lower than the secondquarter rate of 86 percent 
corporate cash flows a measure intended to show funds 
corporations have available for investment rose 13 percent in the 
third quarter compared with a 08 percent rise in the second and a 
56 percent decline in the first 
dividend payments to stockholders increased 2 percent to an 
annual rate of 1233 billion after an identical increase in the 
second quarter

cooperative weather and widespread markdowns are 
luring shoppers to the stores but retailers arent expecting this 
years holiday shopping season to be a blockbuster an industry 
economist says 
rosalind wells the chief economist for the national retail 
merchants association also said wednesday that continued 
discounting is likely as merchants try to draw customers who might 
otherwise take advantage of an extra prechristmas weekend and wait 
until the last minute to shop 
she said feedback from stores around the country showed a patchy 
pattern of sales in the days immediately after thanksgiving when 
shoppers traditionally launch their annual buying binge 
my feeling is that it was a pretty good start to the season 
but nothing exceptional ms wells said 
speaking at a luncheon meeting with reporters ms wells said 
that after talking with retailers about business last friday 
through sunday my sense is that there was overall some 
disappointment 
the nations major retailers will provide an early reading on 
the holidays when they release monthly sales figures on thursday 
most of the big chain stores will report their results for the four 
weeks ended nov 25 
like other analysts ms wells expects a mediocre christmas for 
the retail industry she has predicted holiday sales will rise 55 
percent this year over last year when the sales gain was 9 percent 
over 1987 
i think the preliminary results were getting are consistent 
with our forecast she said 
continuing an almost yearlong trend clothing is moving the 
fastest paced by sales of womens apparel ms wells said mens and 
childrens wear sales are less robust there also is continued 
weakness in sales of homerelated merchandise such as furniture 
floor coverings curtains and appliances 
markdowns by stores strapped for cash and by their competitors 
are giving sales a boost especially in the northeast ms wells 
said a cold snap in the northeast and elsewhere also is 
encouraging shoppers to buy winter goods 
she said special holiday promotions are pervasive and 
particularly intense in areas that have stores owned by financially 
troubled campeau corp whose properties include bloomingdales 
jordan marsh the bon and richsgoldsmiths 
another highly leveraged retailer rh macy amp co is 
responding with aggressive promotions of its own 
in addition to the east coast sales promotions seem to be 
having a major impact in atlanta boston indianapolis and several 
other areas 
business between thanksgiving and christmas generates as much as 
half of a retailers annual income 
in the retailers favor the holiday shopping season is longer 
this year than last year by 1 day spanning a total of 31 days in 
1987 the peak spending season was 28 days 
but ms wells said there is a drawback to this years calendar 
many shoppers knowing they have a final weekend for gift 
hunting might put off buying until the last minute by that time 
retailers would be anxious for business and might offer even bigger 
markdowns to attract customers which would cut into their profits 
i think theres a high probability that thats going to be the 
case ms wells said

the white houses science adviser has denied 
reports the bush administration may seek to slash federal support 
for sematech an industrygovernment consortium working to develop 
advanced computer chips 
i personally am completely unaware of any move to reduce 
support for sematech d allan bromley told the senate armed 
services defense industry and technology subcommittee on wednesday 
but he said the administration does not endorse an advisory 
committees recommendation that government funding for sematech be 
substantially increased from its current level of 100 million a 
year that money is matched by another 100 million from us 
companies 
sen jeff bingaman dnm the subcommittee chairman said he 
was concerned over recent reports of attempts by administration 
officials to drastically reduce or eliminate funding for a number 
of existing programs such as sematech 
other pentagonfunded programs that bingaman said may face 
cutbacks include manufacturing technology highdefinition computer 
displays and xray lithography a technique used for producing 
powerful semiconductor chips 
i believe that the defense department has an appropriate 
role in supporting research in longterm highrisk highpotential 
technologies he said 
bromley testified he shares the concerns expressed in a recent 
report by the national advisory committee on semiconductors over 
the danger of losing us world leadership in the semiconductor 
industry 
in many ways what has and is happening to the semiconductor 
industry is a paradigm for what could happen to other us 
industries such as the computer and telecommunications industries 
unless corrective actions are taken in the immediate future he 
said 
however bromley contended that the money for direct 
government subsidies to somehow reverse the situation by brute 
force is not now available and it is unlikely ever to be 
available even if such funding were available it is unlikely that 
such an approach would work 
the semiconductors advisory committee recommended that 
sematechs funding should be increased immediately by 100 million 
a year split evenly between industry and government it said 
additional funding of 800 million will be required over the next 
three years 
but bromley director of the white house office of science and 
technology policy said the bush administration does not endorse 
major increases in federal funding levels for sematech 
he also said the administration opposes creation of a publicly 
supported corporation to rebuild the consumer electronics industry 
in the united states

a business group formed by congress has urged 
us negotiators to use defense accords with european allies to 
open more trade opportunities for american business 
the advisory committee for trade policy and negotiations which 
consists primarily of business executives said wednesday the 
defense department should coordinate negotiating strategy with the 
us trade representative to boost business 
the report on us policy toward the european economic community 
comes as the 12nation trade bloc prepares to make its 320 million 
consumers into a single market in 1992 
us trade representative carla hills said in a statement that 
the reports recommendations suggest very constructive steps that 
can be taken by the private sector 
she did not refer specifically to the defense accords that 
recommendation pointed to agreements called memorandums of 
understanding between the united states and individual member eec 
governments 
hundreds of the agreements concern the buying of weapons worth 
billions of dollars some are always being renegotiated by pentagon 
officials and european goverments 
the report said renegotiations should be used as leverage to 
make international rules apply to a greater share of european 
governments spending it said such leverage would help expand 
rules to new areas of interest to us exporters 
spending by european governments was one of six issues 
highlighted in the report the report said the 12 governments buy 
600 billion worth of goods and services every year including 
about 150 billion for defense it said 95 percent of the money is 
spent within each country 
the report also recommended ways to safeguard us business 
interests in europe by urging governments there to 
loosen requirements on the origin of imported goods 
give americans a greater share in setting up rules for testing 
help get a common standard for enforcing rules on the transfer 
of technology 
be flexible about buying us television programs 
improve the conditions for foreign insurance and investment

three activist groups have called for the 
ouster of thrift regulator m danny wall but stopped short of 
recommending the same for five senators who interceded with his 
agency on behalf of lincoln savings and loan association 
joining a growing chorus of critics who blame wall primarily for 
lincolns loss of up to 25 billion in federally insured deposits 
were the national taxpayers union public citizen and citizens 
against government waste 
the three groups on wednesday urged president bush in a letter 
to dismiss wall as director of the office of thrift supervision 
saying his decision to delay closing lincoln for 20 months may 
have cost citizens of this country more than any other political 
appointee in history 
on monday senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine also 
called for walls resignation saying everybody will be better 
served by a clean break and new leadership 
house banking committee chairman henry b gonzalez dtexas 
asked bush in a letter last month to replace wall and bush told 
reporters earlier this month he is not closing the door to that 
possibility 
but at the white house on wednesday presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said no decision has been made 
theres been no consideration of mr walls tenure 
fitzwater said hes serving on the board and theres been no 
change 
wall said sunday that he has no intention of resigning and a 
spokesman for him reasserted that tuesday 
meanwhile his office issued press releases wednesday quoting 
new studies as saying that walls handling of 223 sampl failures last 
year saved the government 6 billlion to 8 billion 
while some of the 1988 deals are souring enough of them 
are holding together to make it worthwhile so far for wall to 
have stuck his neck out said veribank a bank rating firm based 
in wakefield mass 
wall was chairman of the federal home loan bank board from july 
1987 until last august when its function as the federal regulator 
of the savings and loan industry was transferred to the new office 
he now heads in the treasury department 
for nearly two months he has been the chief target of hearings 
by gonzalez committee into why the bank board allowed lincoln to 
remain open until last april even though examiners had recommended 
in may 1987 closing the irvine calif thrift 
mr walls behavior in which he frequently appeared to 
knuckle under to political pressure from members of congress and 
the thrift industry shows he is not qualified to hold office in an 
administration dedicated to high ethical standards the 
three public interest groups said in their letter wednesday to bush 
none of the groups was willing to say at a news conference that 
the five senators who interceded on behalf of lincoln in two april 
1987 meetings with walls predecessor and bank board officials in 
charge of the case should also step down 
the senate ethics committee is now investigating whether 
deconcini and the four other senators alan cranston dcalif 
donald w riegle jr dmich john mccain rariz and john 
glenn dohio violated conflictofinterest rules 
together the five senators accepted a total of 13 million in 
contributions for their campaigns or other political causes raised 
by lincolns owner phoenix millionaire charles h keating jr 
deconcini and riegle have since returned the money they received

president bush plans to choose david w 
mullins jr a chief architect of the administrations bailout bill 
for the savings and loan industry to fill a vacancy on the federal 
reserve board an administration source said 
bush plans to nominate mullins an assistant secretary of the 
treasury to fill a vacancy on the sevenmember board expiring jan 
31 1996 said the source who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater acknowledged that mullins 
is the top candidate for the vacancy adding we have not made an 
announcement at this point it could come at any day though 
mullins 43 a former harvard business school professor is a 
longtime associate of treasury secretary nicholas f brady and 
began serving in his current post in october 1988 shortly after 
brady became secretary 
this year mullins attended lengthy congressional sessions to 
write sampl legislation representing the administration in 
behindthescenes deliberations 
earlier he was the no 2 staff person on a presidential task 
force brady headed that studied the october 1987 stock market crash 
his association with brady has been so close hes going to be 
viewed as the treasurys man on the board said economist david 
wyss of drimcgraw hill inc a lexington mass forecasting firm 
any time you get a strong administration type on the board it 
gives the administration a little stronger finger on the lever of 
monetary policy 
in recent months the fed has been somewhat at odds with the 
administration which has favored lower interest rates than the fed 
and has pressed the central bank to be more aggressive in efforts 
to improve the us trade deficit by manipulating the value of the 
dollar on world currency markets 
mullins would be bushs first appointment to the board 
president reagan named the other six members 
however economists warned that previous fed appointees viewed 
as administration representatives subsequently took an independent 
line 
vice chairman manuel johnson came over from the treasury 
but he quickly became his own man said economist david jones of 
aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities dealer in new york 
mullins if nominated and approved by the senate would succeed 
h robert heller who resigned from the fed in june to become 
executive vice president of visa international the credit card 
company 
mullins has little professional background in broad economic and 
monetary policymaking but is highly regarded as an expert on us 
financial markets and the banking system 
he received his undergraduate degree from yale university and 
graduate degrees from the massachusetts institute of technology he 
grew up in fayetteville ark where his father was president of 
the university of arkansas 
the fed as the nations central bank attempts to fight 
inflation and sustain economic growth by manipulating interest 
rates it also regulates the banks that are members of its system 
and governs the activities of bank holding companies

sen lloyd bentsen says the senate finance 
committee which he heads will consider a wide array of proposals 
next year for encouraging saving and investment including a cut in 
capitalgains taxes 
expanded individual retirement accounts also will be considered 
as congress looks for ways to increase productivity and the 
nations ability to compete with foreign producers bentsen said 
wednesday 
is there no way america can better compete abroad the texas 
democrat asked in remarks prepared for a meeting of the tax 
foundation in new york in fact there is the key is to 
accumulate investment capital and then use that capital to 
restore our manufacturing base from the 21 percent of gross 
national product it is today to about 25 percent 
with bentsen and senate majority leader george j mitchell 
dmaine leading the way congress this year defeated president 
bushs call for a reduction in taxes on capital gains which are 
profits from the sale of investments 
democratic leaders viewed the proposed reduction as a windfall 
for the rich the beginning of the undoing of the landmark 1986 tax 
overhaul and a deficitincreaser that would do little for the 
economy they responded with a plan to liberalize taxdeductible 
iras but withdrew that proposal when the capitalgains cut failed 
in his remarks to the tax foundation which honored him with its 
distinguished achievement award bentsen had much to say in favor 
of iras but little for a capitalgains tax cut 
he cited canadas experience as evidence that iras encourage 
saving the us and canadian savings rates were comparable until 
the mid1970s when the canadian rate soared but the us rate fell 
to less than half that of canada bentsen said 
what accounts for this sudden divergence some economists 
believe it can be attributed to broader eligibility and higher 
limits for ira plans in canada bentsen said 
he said he once supported a lower capitalgains tax rate but 
that preferential rate was far more important when the nations 
wealthiest people paid tax rates as high as 90 percent on part of 
their income he said 
he criticized the temporary nature of the capitalgains tax cut 
passed by the house this year and said supporters of a reduction 
must find a way to pay for it 
for a cut to win his support bentsen said we would have to 
answer the virtually unanimous verdict of economists that after 
the first year such a cut drains the treasury

a major restructuring announced by shearson 
lehman hutton inc comes as wall streets secondlargest brokerage 
confronts the fallout from an expansion strategy that was shaken by 
a downturn in the securities industry 
we are moving from a period of growth by acquisition to a 
period of internal consolidation and selective expansion 
shearson chairman peter a cohen said wednesday as the brokerage 
announced major changes in its management structure 
the restructuring which had been expected comes on the heels 
of shearsons announcement that it will lay off hundreds of workers 
and make a drastic cut in stockbroker commissions 
shearson also reportedly is seeking an outside investor to 
provide it with a capital infusion and reduce american express 
cos 61 percent stake in shearson 
under the management shuffle shearson is reassigning president 
jeffrey b lane to a lesser position and shifting another dozen top 
executives shearson also established four core business groups and 
disbanded its main policy making group 
pressure has increased on shearson and other wall street firms 
because of sagging profits in an overall industry slowdown since 
the october 1987 stock market crash 
american express would like to see their ownership generating 
higher profits said analyst perrin long of lipper analytical 
services but if the environment doesnt get better its going to 
be difficult for anyone in the industry to have better profits 
shearson is dividing its businesses into four groups capital 
markets investment and merchant banking private client and 
subsidiary activities similar to realigmnents by other firms in 
recent years 
lane will head the subsidiary activities group that will include 
shearsons money management businesses which have more than 95 
billion in assets under management and its boston co division 
robert s fuld jr who heads shearsons taxable fixedincome 
division was seen as replacing lane as cohens secondincommand 
although fuld was not named as shearson president 
fuld was named president of shearsons capital markets group 
which will include the companys worldwide capital markets 
activities he also will oversee shearsons administrative side 
sherman r lewis jr will head the investment and merchant 
banking group and hardwick simmons will be president of the private 
client group shearsons brokerage operations 
shearson is disbanding its chief policymaking committee the 
11member policy group but will create a business development 
committee to help identify future directions for the firm 
shearsons net income fell to 106 million in the first nine 
months of this year down 3 percent from 110 million in the same 
period last year 
the firms woes stem partly from its january 1988 acquisition of 
ef hutton group inc for close to 1 billion and its 1984 merger 
with lehman brothers kuhn loeb inc the latter deal marked a major 
expansion for shearson from retail brokerage into investment 
banking essentially arranging or providing financing for 
corporate buyouts 
analysts said lehmans old business generally has helped the 
firm in the last two years but shearsons pretax profit margin 
has not approached its premerger levels of 15 percent for the 
1989 third quarter pretax profit margin was just over 1 percent 
compared with an industry average of about 4 percent 
additionally analysts said the hutton buyout saddled shearson 
with debt and cost the firm more than 1 billion in writeoffs 
following the lehman acquisition the significant increase in 
the capital markets business really made them a force particularly 
in mergers and acquisitions said lawrence eckenfelder a 
securities industry analyst for prudential bache securities inc in 
san francisco 
but he said the hutton acquisition created problems because 
the business didnt really pick up it dissipated 
because of the slowdown shearson this month said it would cut 
broker commissions by 1 percent to 2 percent in 1990 and lay off up 
to 800 employees by years end that would reduce the firm to 
35700 employees from a peak of 46000 
also american express reportedly is considering selling a 
portion of its shearson stake to an outside investor to provide the 
firm with more capital a deal would have to be approved by 
shearson american express and nippon life insurance co of japan 
which owns 13 percent of shearson 
the capital infusion could help appease moodys investors 
service the wall street credit rating agency last month said it 
was considering lowering its rating on shearsons long and 
shortterm debt because of the firms exposure to corporate buyout 
debts and its softening business prospects 
john kriz a moodys assistant vice president said wednesday 
the credit rating agency had not made a decision on shearson

the owner of an automobile dealership may have 
more in common than he realizes with the couple that runs a few 
retail stores or the building contractor who owns operations spread 
over several states 
they are all involved in familyrun businesses and are the 
targets of the publishers of a new magazine called family business 
the premiere issue of the magazine was recently sent to a 
charter susbcriber group numbering 100000 the magazine will be 
available monthly both at the newstand and by subscription starting 
in january 
in an interview wednesday publisher leonard zweig estimated 
there are 7 million familyowned businesses in the united states 
but he said that despite the introduction of a number of 
consumeroriented business magazines over the past several years 
he found none that dealt exclusively with issues important to 
owners of family businesses 
entrepreneur for instance contains information on how to get a 
business started but zweig said information on how to pass a 
business along to heirs may be more relevant for a familyrun 
business that has dealt with startup issues generations earlier 
there has been a resurgence of interest in family 
businesses zweig said he said mba students five years ago would 
seldom admit it if they intended to go to work for their own 
familys business but today are forming clubs where issues 
affecting such operations are discussed 
the takeover wave has made familyrun business a more appealing 
career option he said corporate life is not offering the secure 
niche people thought it was he said 
samir a husni the university of mississippi journalism 
professor who publishes an annual guide to new magazines said it 
appears that family business has found a niche that has not been 
filled by other magazines 
its a good idea but how well they execute the idea remains to 
be seen he said he estimates only two of 10 new magazines 
survive four years 
family business is designed for the 15 million to 2 million 
familyowned businesses with sales of 1 million to 100 million 
zweig said 
the cover story in the first issue deals with a company that is 
called into to contain oil and toxic waste spills on waterways and 
describes how the father who owns the business is learning to trust 
his children to run it 
another story discusses how healthy family companies base 
salaries for family members on performance rather than sentiment 
regular features will include an advice column with tips on 
raising capital handling tax issues and settling disputes 
jack nessel a former editorial executive with new york and 
psychology today magazines is the editorinchief of family 
business which is being published from great barrington mass 
publishing consultant robert s walker of periodical studies 
service inc said new magazines for small business are a hot 
genre sustained partly by the need to advertise a proliferation 
of new products these businesses may find useful such as 
computers fax machines and cellular telephones 
advertisers in the first issue included investment and business 
consulting companies financial services concerns and office 
equipment makers 
there were 12 pages of ads in the first 72page issue zweig 
plans to have an editorialtoadvertising ratio of 60 percent to 40 
percent 
the magazine is owned by mlr enterprises a familyrun business 
based in philadelphia that publishes the professional magazines 
mergers amp acquisitions and directors amp boards and offers database 
services 
zweig said mlr is investing several million dollars in launching 
the magazine and expects that it will take four years for it to 
become profitable he declined to be specific on how much mlr was 
prepared to lose 
subscriptions will cost 3397 for a year and single copies will 
be sold for 350 each at the newstand zweig said he would 
eventually like to boost circulation to 250000 to 300000

machinist union leaders have huddled to assess 
the impact of the defections of pilots and flight attendants on 
their strike against eastern airlines and vowed to continue their 
walkout however long it takes 
machinists president george kourpias said wednesday the union 
would try to pressure texas air corp easterns parent company 
and the bankruptcy court overseeing the cashstrapped carrier into 
a settlement 
the plans include demanding that bankruptcy judge burton r 
lifland in charge of the eastern case since the airline filed for 
protection from creditors five days after the beginning of the 
strike remove himself from the case kurpias and other machinists 
leaders have accuse bias in favor of frank lorenzo head of texas 
the union also plans to push eastern to make ts to its pension 
plan which is currently owedas 1 billion and take legal action 
against eastern and texas air if the payments are not madr cash and 
court actions involving the underfunded pension planaffect 
easterns attempt to emerge soon from baourpias who met with 
machinists vice president paul and the eastern union leaders said 
the unould seek to lobby congress to win enough suppoident bushs 
veto of legislation creating a conanel to recommend a solution 
the pilots at attendants cited the veto last week in makingions 
to end sympathy strikes in support of the ists who walked off the 
job march 4 after refusrant more than 150 million in workrule and 
otoncessions sought by eastern 
kourpias in called those decisions disappointing but pon 
now alone on the picket lines will not en strike until the 
eastern workers win the fairst treatment on the job that frank 
lorenzo tried to strip away when he forced the strike 
the machinists however face an array of obstacles to winning 
back the strike or the jobs of their more than 3000 members who 
worked as mechanics and baggage handlers 
eastern was not concerned with the prospect of a machinists 
strike from the outset but was stung when the pilots unexpectedly 
supported the walkout 
since then however the miamibased airline has been rebuilding 
and has told the 1700 flight attendants and the 2000 or so pilots 
that it has few if any jobs for those who now wish to return to 
work 
those unions hope to win more of their jobs back through 
negotiations with the company and are considering legal action 
against eastern if those efforts fail 
henry duent of the pilots union told reporters wednesday he 
expects eastern to rehire about 700 union pilots at a pace of about 
100 a month he said eastern officials had taken a soft 
approach in initial discussions about returning to work 
the airline needs some reconciliation with its traditional 
employees to work because its sure not working now duffy said

although female doctors can successfully combine 
child rearing with teaching at medical schools most feel that 
motherhood has slowed their careers according to a survey released 
today 
women make up 19 percent of medical school faculties up from 
13 percent two decades ago but they have been slower to crack the 
the academic worlds top ranks 
a nationwide survey of 558 of these women all younger than 50 
found that nearly twothirds had children about half of those with 
youngsters had delayed starting their families until they were in 
their early 30s and had finished their medical training 
although the majority said they were satisfied with their 
careers and their decision to have children 78 percent felt that 
their families had slowed their job advancement 
we believe that it is possible for women to combine motherhood 
with a fulfilling career in academic medicine but it is difficult 
and most such women believe that motherhood slows the progress of 
their careers the researchers wrote 
drs wendy levinson and susan w tolle of oregon health sciences 
university and charles lewis of the university of california los 
angeles conducted the survey the results were published in 
todays new england journal of medicine 
to earn senior posts on medical faculties junior doctors must 
first receive tenure and that requires conducting research and 
publishing reports among other duties 
the studys authors suggested that women or men who take 
time off for their children be given longer to complete these 
milestones for example a faculty member working half time would 
have twice as long to achieve standards for promotion and tenure as 
those working full time they wrote 
in a separate commentary in the journal dr carola eisenberg a 
child psychiatrist at harvard medical school said medical schools 
should use affirmative action to get more women into their upper 
levels 
if there is only one tenure slot and there are both men and 
women fully qualified to fill it a woman should be appointed 
she wrote that is the only way to offset the prevailing pattern 
of discrimination 
she also urged that the proportion of women among tenured 
faculty members rise from the current 67 percent to 10 percent 
within the next three years 
does anyone really believe that 500 qualified women cannot be 
found among the 8000 now at the level of assistant or associate 
professor to make this goal realistic she asked

after two days of testimony on the pros and 
cons of shortselling by company heads traders and exchange 
officials a house panel is slated to hear from federal regulators 
next week 
market regulation and enforcement officials of the securities 
and exchange commission are scheduled to testify about the trading 
strategy next wednesday 
when selling short an investor tries to take advantage of an 
anticipated drop in a companys stock price the investor borrows 
stock from a broker hoping to replace it with stock purchased at a 
lower price the investors profit comes from the difference 
between the price of the borrowed stock and the lower price paid to 
replace it 
profits from shortselling can be huge but the risks are great 
if the stocks price doesnt go down the investor will have to pay 
a higher price to replace the borrowed stock 
in opening three days of hearings on shortselling tuesday rep 
doug barnard jr dga said the practice is legitimate and 
accepted in the market but the subcommittee was concerned about 
persistent reports of efforts by shortsellers to manipulate 
stock prices downward through various techniques meant to be 
harmful to the companies or their shareholders 
barnard chairs the commerce consumer and monetary affairs 
subcommittee of the house government operations committee 
on wednesday the head of a nationwide association of companies 
traded in the overthecounter market told the panel that tougher 
federal disclosure laws are needed to curb manipulative practices 
in shortselling 
john f guion president of the national association of otc 
companies told a house panel that a survey conducted by the 
800member organization points out the need for such curbs 
of the 183 companies responding to the survey 22 percent said 
they believed their companys stock had been the subject of 
shortselling by professional shortsellers 
guion said the securities and exchange commission should adopt a 
rule requiring anyone who sells short a number of shares exceeding 
5 percent of a companys outstanding stock notify the company the 
sec and the market where the stock is traded within 10 days 
in earlier testimony other witnesses complained that 
professional shortsellers often break the rules to get a stock to 
drop quickly so they can take their profit and get out 
their alleged methods include spreading false rumors about a 
company that it is about to declare bankruptcy or that it is under 
sec investigation 
we find these companies are suffering from the standpoint of 
survival said barnard the subcommittee chairman 
guion said 83 percent of the companies surveyed believe 
shortsellers should be required to report their short interest 
positions when they exceed a specified amount of shares 
but other witnesses were less enthusiastic about such a 
requirement 
its difficult to say that additional information would not be 
helpful said john pinto of the national association of 
securities dealers a selfregulatory organization that oversees 
the overthecounter market but i really dont think it would be 
a significant regulatory tool

after a decade of playing the field from 
oilfields to goldfields jim bob moffett is ready to settle down 
moffett who assembled an unlikely combination of fertilizer 
mills oil and gas wells sulfur mines indonesian copper pits and 
australian gold ore into the natural resources company 
freeportmcmoran inc will sell up to 15 billion worth of assets 
in an abrupt change in strategy the company said wednesday it 
will prune away many of the operations it bought during the 1980s 
fully a third of the company and focus on phosphate fertilizers 
metals and oil and gas in the gulf of mexico 
this is a case of selling peanuts to enjoy the watermelon 
moffett said referring to seven operations ranging from the 
freeportmcmoran gold co subsidiary to the companys canadian oil 
and gas reserves 
moffett hopes to realize 12 to 15 billion one unit already 
has been sold and two were put on the block earlier this year 
of the proceeds 900 million will be used to support huge 
mineral discoveries made within the past 18 months 
one is the largest known existing sulfur deposit in north 
america called main pass block 299 situated under 200 feet of 
water off the louisiana coast freeport which owns 583 percent of 
the deposit estimates its worth 54 billion 
the other is the grasberg deposit on the remote indonesian 
island of irian jaya its 39 billion pounds of copper more than 
double the copper reserves of subsidiary freeportmcmoran copper co 
mixed with the copper are 56 million ounces of gold more than 
the twice the 25 million ounces of north american reserves the 
company will unload by selling freeportmcmoran gold co because 
the gold is mined along with copper and silver its production 
costs should be substantially less than those of the north american 
mines 
with 18 billion in debt already on its books and only 474 
million in equity as of sept 30 it was time to decide which 
assets were most expendable moffett said 
we cant be everywhere any more moffett said we have to 
find niches where we have a leg up 
the company plans to use up to 600 million of the sale proceeds 
to cut debt 
the assets up for sale generated at least 345 million in 
revenues in 1988 according to freeport financial reports 18 
percent of the companys total but moffett said earnings will 
remain steady through 1992 
the gap will be made up by a combination of the cash from the 
asset sales a 50 million cut in general and administrative costs 
and lower operating and interest expenses 
after 1992 moffett said revenues from main pass and grasberg 
will begin to gush into the companys coffers 
securities analysts agreed we think its a good move to 
streamline operations said barbara cranner of howard weil 
labouisse friedrichs they had to do something about debt 
low resource prices plus high interest costs depressed the 
companys earnings performance this year earnings fell from 335 
a share in the first nine months of 1988 to 175 in the same 
period this year 
investors appeared only mildly impressed by the plan 
freeportmcmoran which reached a high of 38 a share in april 
closed at 3012 wednesday up 50 cents freeportmcmoran resource 
partners which owns the main pass sulfur deposit closed at 
2050 up 50 cents while freeport copper which is developing the 
grasberg strike rose 125 cents to 2087

danny hillis says the supercomputer he is 
designing will be able to take complex problems that now require a 
year of calculations and solve them in a few hours 
in addition the machine would need just 1 second to perform 1 
trillion mathematical operations such as additions or 
multiplications 
you could tally up the national debt in 1 second hillis 
said 
hillis is cofounder and chief scientist of thinking machines 
corp in cambridge the company announced this week it was getting 
12 million from the pentagon to develop a supercomputer that works 
1000 times faster than standard models now available and more than 
100 times faster than the top machines 
thinking machines said it was receiving the government money 
from the pentagons defense advanced research projects agency 
which has been awarding grants aimed at keeping the united states 
the world leader in highspeed supercomputers 
hillis said he expects the project to be completed by the 
mid1990s but his company hopes to have a smaller version ready to 
present to the pentagon in 1992 
thinking machines uses a process called parallel computing in 
which smaller computers work separately to solve small pieces of 
bigger problems the companys current models contain about 64000 
smaller computers but the new machine could use up to 1 million 
processors 
other supercomputer makers such as world leading cray research 
inc use parallel processing to a much smaller extent 
instead they do large chunks of problems and work quickly from 
one facet to the next said bob trier director of technical 
programs for research consortium inc a minneapolisbased company 
that studies the supercomputer market for users and vendors 
while machines that use parallel processing can do many 
calculations at once they also are tailored more to solving 
specific problems and are less flexible in their uses trier said 
also he said some complex mathematical problems must be solved 
one step at a time and do not lend themselves to parallel 
processing 
but hillis said his company which has been growing about 50 
percent a year and provides computers for the national aeronautics 
and space administration will produce machines that have many 
applications 
for example he said the supercomputers can perform 
calculations in human genetics can help design microchips and even 
simulate how a car will work before it is built 
some problems literally would take a year to do on current 
computers hillis said if it takes a year to do you might as 
well build the car 
by contrast the new computer would take only a few hours to 
solve such problems he said

china plans to produce a record 412 million tons 
of grain next year as the state puts more land into cultivation and 
invests more in the countryside agriculture minister he kang said 
he said at a meeting wednesday that grain production will be up 
from an estimated harvest of 405 million tons this year the 
official china daily reported thursday 
he said the nation also hoped to produce up to 44 million tons 
of cotton next year up from this years output of about 4 million 
tons substantial gains are also planned in production of edible 
oils meat and fishery products 
the minister said 163 million acres of land will be put into 
grain production making the total 272 million acres 
following a record grain harvest of 407 million tons in 1984 
china has had four straight substandard crops a result of poor 
weather and low stateset prices for grain that have discouraged 
production good weather has helped raise output this year but the 
harvest will still fall short of the 1984 figure 
chinese agricultural experts say the nation must increase output 
by at least 10 million tons a year to 500 million tons at the end 
of the decade just to keep up with population growth

with the holiday season gearing up a 
chocolate supplier is urging the federal government to avoid a 
chocolate shortage by temporarily lifting the import quota for 
nonfat dry milk 
but the chocolate industry is running into opposition from dairy 
farmers who contend that lifting the quota would cause domestic 
milk prices to plummet 
peter van leer whose 40yearold family business in jersey 
city nj produces more than 30 million pounds of dark and milk 
chocolate each year said the import limit for nonfat dry milk is 
7000 pounds a year 
thats what we use in a day said van leer whose company 
supplies chocolate to pepperidge farm cookies godiva chocolates 
and ben amp jerrys ice cream 
dry milk also is used in the production of dairy products like 
ice creams and cottage cheese 
van leer and another major chocolate supplier mampm mars of 
hackettstown nj have seen the price of nonfat dry milk 
skyrocket from about 85 cents a pound to as much as 250 a pound 
in october during a period of fall shortages prices have dipped 
closer to 2 more recently 
on nov 6 new jerseys two us seators and nine of its house 
members appealed to agriculture secretary clayton yeutter to 
suspend the quota and keep chocolate treats on the shelf this 
season 
the fall is the busiest season for the chocolate manufacturing 
industry as it works to meet increased demand for holiday baking 
and giftgiving the lawmakers wrote without nonfat dry milk 
the availability of a wide variety of chocolatebased goods to the 
consumer will be restricted 
as of wednesday the usda had provided no detailed response to 
the letter said a spokesman for sen frank lautenberg dnj 
whose office drafted the letter 
dairy farmers oppose any easing of restrictions saying nonfat 
dry milk supplies have loosened in the last few weeks so that 
consumers will not face christmas without their favorite chocolate 
desserts 
we have sympathy with the chocolate industry said mike 
brown an economist with the national milk producers federation 
we want people who use milk to make a living but we dont want 
the government to do silly things that are going to hurt the 
industry 
van leer said this years dry milk shortage has forced him to 
supply some of his chocolate at a loss because much of his 
chocolate sells at prices agreed upon months before shipping 
were hurt this season but were delivering on our 
commitments said van leer who has not yet tallied his loss i 
havent had the heart to measure it 
both the dairy farmers and chocolate producers agreed that 
something must be done yearround to stop american chocolate buyers 
from bypassing milk and sugar import restrictions by purchasing 
bulk chocolate from european producers 
were losing market share van leer said the real 
solution is to make those chocolates subject to the quotas for 
sugar and milk

in revolutionary times every philadelphia 
neighborhood had its own brew pub where a patron could stop for a 
pint of beer freshly brewed that day 
prohibition seemed to put an end to that but now theres a 
place where someone again can watch beer tapped directly from the 
brewing tanks the samuel adams brew house a collaboration of 
david mink owner of the sansom street oyster house and jim koch 
founder of the boston beer co which brews samuel adams beer 
a pleasant smell of brewing permeates the air and the vats are 
enclosed behind a glass partition readily seen by patrons the 
tanks have a direct pipeline to the taps at the bars counter 
the beer comes all of five feet from the brewery to your 
glass koch said 
freshness is the key ingredient said mink it makes such 
a difference 
of the bars three traditional beers a golden ale an amber 
and a porter the porter drew the most raves from patrons at 
wednesdays opening 
rightly so since the beer took a silver medal last october at 
the great american beer festival in denver said jim pericles the 
brewer 
one patron rich wagner described the dark brew pleasant 
with a rich clean flavor 
wagner a home brewer said philadelphia once was known for its 
porters its a shame that the porters died out earlier in the 
century but now weve got one back he said 
another patron dan allan of philadelphia was glad that brewing 
in general had returned 
the city was a major brewing center through the 1800s when a 
large influx of german immigrants brought their tradition with them 
most of the smaller brewers died out by the turn of the century 
even the major ones have died out the last brewery schmidts 
closed in 1987 
brew pubs started like most us trends in california when 
that state eliminated prohibitionera legislation banning such 
establishments said dan fink staff member of the association of 
brewers a boulder colobased research and marketing institution 
the pubs do well in a variety of large cities like san francisco 
and chicago but also are picking up in places like tempe ariz 
and lawrence kan fink said 
plans are already under way to bring another brew pub to 
philadelphia 
brewmeister jeff ware whose dock street beer is brewed under 
contract in utica ny also has applied for a liquor license 
plans for the dock street brewing co include a 200seat capacity 
with a 40foot bar and 10 copper brewing vats 
ware plans to brew five or six varieties including wheat beers 
in the summer bock beers in the spring and heavier ale in the 
winter

followed a 03 percent advance in september but auto sales have 
continued to fall foretelling continued sluggishness in the

although the san francisco bayarea earthquake reduced incomes 
by about 21 billion at an annual rate in october that decrease 
was offsetby increases in farm subsidies and bonus payments in the 
auto industry 
spending declined to an annual rate of 353 trillion after a 
03 percent gain in september it was the first decrease since a 
01 percent dip in september 1988 and the largest drop since a 14 
percent decrease in january 1987 
the october report showed that americans incomes after taxes 
also rose 09 percent up from septembers 02 percent gain 
americans savings rate savings as a percent of disposable 
income rose 57 percent the highest since a 58 percent rate last

for more than a century the name bofors 
commanded respect as a maker of topquality weapons and a flagship 
of swedish industry when scandals rocked bofors all of sweden 
trembled 
bofors has become synonymous with corruption in the murky world 
of the international arms trade its questioned dealings with prime 
minister rajiv gandhi helped bring him down in indias recent 
elections 
a trial of three former bofors executives has exposed evidence 
of foul play in the corridors of power the corruption charges have 
deflated the faith many swedes had in the honesty of their 
leadership 
two affairs concerning bofors were uncovered in the last five 
years 
bofors was accused of paying up to 50 million in bribes to 
secure a 1986 contract to sell 14 billion in artillery guns to 
india 
bofors executives were tried on charges of violating export 
restrictions in 197981 to sell advanced surfacetoair missiles to 
middle east countries by using singapore as an intermediary the 
verdict is due dec 22 
other arms manufacturers have been implicated in other cases of 
alleged unauthorized sales 
bofors spokesman borje johanson a former army lieutenant 
colonel said bofors now is playing strictly by the book and 
concentrating on delivering good products and fullfilling 
contracts unethical deals will not exist he said 
ab bofors does not see itself as just another swedish company 
in the entrance to the companys elegant headquarters hangs a 
portrait of alfred nobel the benefactor of the nobel prizes who 
once owned bofors 
bofors is swedens largest weapons manufacturer and belongs to 
the nobel industries group one of the powerhouses of swedish 
industry though privately owned bofors operates almost like a 
government company 
production is tuned to the needs of the swedish military and 
exports are severly restricted according to regulations forbidding 
sales to countries in conflict or in volatile regions 
this country of only 84 million people produces supersonic 
warplanes submarines and surface battle ships bofors alone makes 
a range of artillery missiles air defense systems and explosives 
sweden says it needs an independent arms industry and strong 
defense to give teeth to its neutrality and avoid entanglements 
with any military alliance 
each foreign sale must be approved by the war materials 
inspection board a government agency under a strict set of rules 
at their 10week trial the former bofors directors admitted 
skirting the export restrictions by selling the equipment to 
singapore but they claimed they were innocent of criminal activity 
because the government tacitly approved the sales 
one of the defense attorneys goran ekdahl said a system of 
tacit agreements had been practiced for 20 years because the 
government wanted to avoid an open debate about where its weaponry 
was being used 
government officials and former ministers denied knowing the 
weapons were being sold to blacklisted countries but testimony and 
documents showed that the security police and at least some 
officials were informed and took no action to stop the sales 
in 1987 when the affairs were being scrutinized the head of 
the war material inspection board carl algernon fell in front of 
a subway train in what police ruled was an apparent suicide 
gunnar adlerkarlsson an economics professor author and social 
critic said he believed top government officials were lying in the 
bofors case 
i cannot prove it but it is absolutely clear as far as i am 
concerned that all ministers of trade and war material inspectors 
understood that what was officially going to singapore absolutely 
would not stay in singapore adlerkarlsson said 
bofors image problems were compounded by its handling of the 
bribery accusations in the indian howitzer contract 
bofors denied the allegations but rejected demands from indian 
opposition leaders to open its books gandhi also denied that any 
indian had received kickbacks or commissions but he resigned last 
week after his congress party failed to win a majority in national 
elections that focused on charges of corruption and ineptitude 
bofors officials said they were intent on riding out the storm 
because it was a matter of company ethics not to reveal classifed 
parts of a business contract 
we cannot contradict the wish of the customer or the 
contracts we have signed and go out and reveal the content of 
various agreements said johanson the company spokesman 
if we did it would mean that in the long run we and sweden 
couldnt sign agreements and be trusted that this is an issue 
between buyer and seller he said

business is booming in business class 
in the competitive airline industry many big carriers are 
racing to cash in on the growing popularity of business class 
which is more expensive than economy but cheaper than first class 
business class is found mainly on international flights it has 
grown as business has become more globalized boosting air travel 
abroad 
it reflects the amount of international business thats 
happening said randy petersen editor and publisher of frequent 
a monthly newsletter published in colorado springs colo 
jetpowered executives look for service comfort and more space 
to work in as they shuttle between the united states western 
europe and the far east and their companies are willing to pay 
extra for them to arrive in better shape 
a lot extra a business class ticket from new york to london 
for example costs around 1400 to 1500 one way compared with 
an economy fare of 450 to 865 first class which provides even 
more pampering than the business cabins is the steepest 2400 to 
2800 one way for the same flight 
in return business class passengers get separate checkin 
counters and special lounges at airports and separate cabins in 
the air with wider seats fancier food free liquor and other 
amenities they also get a lot more attention than passengers in 
the cramped coach section the ratio of flight attendants to fliers 
increases from economy to business to first 
who flies in business class united airlines says about 80 
percent of its business fliers are men mainly business executives 
with an average income of more than 80000 a year they average 11 
airline trips per year two of which are international 
some big us airlines aiming to capitalize on the business 
class boom are emulating foreign carriers with strong reputations 
for international service 
united for example recently announced that it is spending more 
than 45 million to upgrade its business class service in what it 
calls the largest renovation program in us airline history 
british airways plc whose revenue from business class has jumped 
106 percent in the past year spent 40 million on an upgrade 
program in early 1988 
business class customers are very important to our 
international air travel business united chairman stephen m 
wolf said in launching the improvement program these new 
enhancements will give our international service a strong 
competitive edge 
chicagobased united offers business class on its flights to and 
from the far east the worlds longest hauls where comfort 
becomes even more important its flight from los angeles to sydney 
australia for example takes 14 hours and 40 minutes 
business class accounted for around 390 million of uniteds 
89 billion in revenue in 1988 the airline plans to include the 
service on its new flights to europe next spring 
some us airlines are catching up with big foreign carriers in 
the international service game said dan smith director of 
industry relations for the international airline passengers 
association in dallas 
in the united states where the airlines have been deregulated 
since 1978 cheap fares and reduced labor costs have been 
emphasized more than service carriers in western europe and the 
far east on the other hand still operate mainly under government 
control of fares and routes 
closer to home only trans world airlines and pan am offer 
business class to any significant extent on domestic us flights 
notably on coasttocoast flights which use bigger jets 
the smaller narrowbody jets used for most domestic flights are 
difficult to divide up into three sections so the majority of us 
flights offer only economy and first class 
in addition many companies will pay for employees to fly 
business class on long overseas trips but will limit them to 
economy on domestic flights 
twa which gets 12 percent to 13 percent of its revenue from 
business class and advertises its service aggressively provides it 
on many flights from its st louis hub as well as on 
transcontinental and international trips 
we saw a niche to fill said jim faulkner a spokesman for 
twa in st louis 
as an inducement to passengers its domestic business class 
often costs only slightly more than economy twas oneway business 
class fare from st louis to boston for example is 411 compared 
with 391 in coach and 670 in first class 
rival pan am offers passengers on transcontinental flights a 
business class ticket at the same price as a full economy fare 
588 one way from new york to los angeles 
a fair number of business class fliers pay less than the full 
fare because they fly a lot around 20 percent to 30 percent of 
business class passengers are flying on bonus upgrades from coach 
accrued in frequent flier programs frequent editor petersen 
estimates

ford of canada said thursday it will 
close an engine plant at the end of 1990 eliminating 900 jobs 
the announcement to halt engine and stamping production at 
engine plant 2 in windsor was expected since no product had been 
allocated for the 67yearold plant past the end of next year 
the canadian auto workers recently urged ford to make a decision 
on the plants future to allow workers to look for other jobs 
the plant also was shut down in 1981 during a slump in the 
automotive industry but it was temporarily reactived in 1983 to 
meet increased demand for the fiveliter v8 engine 
ford has been telling workers for the last few years that there 
is no production planned for the plant at the end of 1990 said leo 
brown manager of fords windsor engine plants 
the city has two other ford engine plants a casting plant and 
an aluminum plant 
the number of ford cars using the fiveliter engine has declined 
and some have been replaced by the 38litre engine brown said

corn and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher thursday on the chicago board of trade amid indications the 
soviet union bought 2 million to 4 million metric tons of us corn 
wheat futures ended mostly lower as some traders simultaneously 
sold wheat and bought corn 
the rumored soviet buying which was not confirmed would 
represent the first significant grain export deal in several weeks 
it sparked a brisk rally in the corn and soybean markets at the 
opening bell 
but prices closed below their opening levels perhaps reflecting 
an overriding bearish sentiment 
considering the size of the rumored soviet purchase the 
market didnt act all that well said victor lespinasse a trader 
with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
the soviet union bought 8 million metric tons of us corn in 
october for shipment in november and december and was expected to 
buy more for shipment in january through march

higher with the contract for delivery in december at 407 a

thirtythree congressmen urged president bush 
on thursday to give priority in his talks with soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev to ending a rule that imposes high us tariffs 
on imports from the soviet union 
bush has power to waive the jacksonvanik amendment a provision 
in us trade law that denies the soviets the most favored 
nation status because of limits on emigration china hungary and 
poland already have the status 
the soviet government has come a long way in addressing the 
concerns we have long expressed the congressmen said in a letter 
to bush as he was leaving for the talks with gorbachev in the 
mediterranean 
assuming you are assured of continued soviet progress it is 
now time to recognize and reward soviet progress with a waiver 
under jacksonvanik they said 
at the end of august the soviet union had allowed more than 
96000 of its citizens to leave more than in any entire year for 
the past two decades 
the letter was signed six senators including majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine and 27 house members all are democrats 
except for six house members 
rep tom downey dny who last june introduced a resolution 
supporting a waiver once bush received assurances on free 
emigration from moscow the supreme soviet is expected to complete 
action in january on a bill to free emigration 
the lower tariffs would only take effect after soviet and us 
officials negotiate a trade accord it was agreed earlier this 
month to create working parties that would start work on the 
agreement but valery sorokin economic counselor at the soviet 
embassy said on thursday that they have not yet met 
formal negotiations are expected to start later and american 
officials say they would take several months after which bush 
would issue the waiver

sikorsky aircraft said it will lay off 
about 150 hourly workers friday in part because of shrinking us 
and international defense spending 
the layoffs announced wednesday in a notice posted at four 
company plants in connecticut will be the first in sikorskys 
bluecollar work force since february 1988 when the helicopter 
builder laid off 19 hourly workers 
sikorsky a division of hartfordbased united technologies inc 
laid off 350 salaried workers in july a 6 percent cut in its 
salaried ranks 
this employee reduction must be made to remain competitive in 
the face of shrinking worldwide defense budgets in the years to 
come sikorsky vice president john a carpino said in the notice 
he also said that future production of us military 
helicopters will be reduced below anticipated levels despite strong 
congressional support for sikorskys programs during the current 
budget cycle 
wolfgang demish a defense industry analyst with ubs securities 
in new york said the company will likely be forced to consider 
further reductions 
to the extent that theres a relaxation of military tensions 
worldwide the demand for military helicopters worldwide is going 
down sikorsky remains at risk of further cuts he said 
the layoffs will leave sikorsky with a total work force of about 
12650 including 6550 hourly workers company spokesman larry 
bingaman said 
the notice said sikorsky will continue to assess employment 
levels in light of its projected work load bingaman declined to 
say if the company expects further layoffs 
i dont think many people are projecting an increase in the 
defense budget either in the united states or internationally in 
the years to come he said 
although it has tried to boost sales of its commercial 
helicopter the s76 more than 80 percent of sikorskys sales 
continue to be military the company also has been pushing foreign 
sales of its us military aircraft 
foreign sales represented only 6 percent of the companys sales 
five years ago but are expected to represent 25 percent this year 
bingaman said

the european communitys 66 partners 
from africa the caribbean and pacific ocean on thursday rejected a 
135 billion trade and aid offer 
the package which the ec said was not negotiable was very 
much below the request of the third world associates nigerian 
ambassador to the ec joshua iroha said 
the third world countries had asked for 175 billion 
the acp group expresses its deep concern and disappointment 
iroha said adding that european community aid had regularly 
decreased in real terms since their first agreement was signed in 
1975 
the countries claimed the diminishing volume of aid granted over 
the past 15 years could only be compensated by raising the funds to 
175 billion in the next agreement 
iroha said talks with the 12member european trading bloc will 
continue he said if no solution is found a plenary meeting of the 
66 countries would be called to decide on further steps

stock prices rallied in moderate trading today 
after new economic indicators raised investor hopes for lower 
interest rates 
stocks opened on a firm tone behind a strengthening bond market 
after new reports pointed to a slowdown in fourthquarter economic 
growth 
the commerce department reported that consumer spending fell 02 
percent in october despite a 09 percent rise in persona incomes 
another report by the purchasing management association showed a 
decline in a chicagoarea economic index for november to 491 
percent from 517 percent analysts said that set the tone for the 
purchasing agents nationwide survey due out on friday 
it would indicate a further softening of the economy and 
probable cause of the fed to loosen interest rates said charles 
jensen chief technical analyst for mki securities corp 
lower interest rates would stimulate economic growth including 
corporate earnings 
however while blue chip issues were relatively strong the 
secondary market continued to languish traders said 
bank stocks remained under pressure amid interest rate worries 
and concern about leveraged buyout loans new federal regulations 
require banks to report loans for buyouts acquisitions and

carl icahns latest move on usx corp sent the 
companys stock climbing thursday but analysts say the takeover 
strategists plans regarding the energy and steel giant are no 
clearer than they were before 
icahn who owns trans world airlines inc has indicated several 
times in recent years that he might acquire a substantial stake in 
usx but he has made an actual public buyout offer only once and 
that was dropped following rejection by the usx board 
im not sure whether this is a mountain or a molehill said 
john jacobson vice president of steel consulting for aus 
consultants in philadelphia 
jacobson said icahns disclosure wednesday that he was 
requesting federal approval to acquire at least 25 percent of 
pittsburghbased corporation was just something he had to do to 
keep his options open 
gregory drahuschak an analyst with butcher amp singer in 
pittsburgh said he has serious doubts icahn would try to take 
over usx 
theres no way youll make me believe he wants to run the 
company drahuschak said its the capital commitment that 
would be required were talking serious money 
based on its roughly 2575 million outstanding common shares 
usx has a market value of some 88 billion 
usx stock rose 75 cents to 3437 thursday in active new york 
stock exchange trading 
icahns latest filing could be an attempt to prod usx chairman 
charles corry to speed up restructuring or sell major assets 
analysts said icahn long has advocated a spinoff of usxs steel 
division formerly known as united states steel as a way to boost 
shareholder values 
is he waving a paper tiger before usx again is he asking for 
a divestiture of its oil and gas properties we dont know said 
george zimmermann director of research at gruntal amp co in new 
york 
icahn is seeking antitrust clearance from the federal trade 
commission to increase his usx stake according to a filing 
wednesday with the securities and exchange commission icahn owned 
nearly 34 million or 1326 percent of usxs outstanding common 
shares 
a usx spokesman declined comment thursday except to say icahn 
made similar requests in late 1987 and late 1988 but never boosted 
his stake to the amount requested in the allotted year 
corry said wednesday that he had a long telephone conversation 
with icahn last friday and icahn gave no indication what he planned 
to do with the stock 
he said once again that he thought the companys stock would 
perform better if we didnt have holdings in steel and oil he 
wants one or the other corry told reporters following a speech 
icahn was in meetings thursday his secretary said he did not 
immediately return a phone call to his new york office seeking 
comment 
icahn made a 719 billion or 31 a share offer for usx in 
early 1987 but dropped the proposal after the usx board rejected 
it when he made his bid there was speculation he only wanted to 
drive up the stock price and profit from it but he did not sell 
his shares when he abandoned the offer 
i think one of the reasons icahn bought into the business is 
he felt the breakup value of the pieces are greater than the value 
of the whole jacobson said i think thats why usx continues 
to be a speculative stock candidate 
zimmermann and charles a bradford senior analyst for merrill 
lynch capital markets in new york value usx stock at less than 30 
a share 
but jacobson said the stock might be worth nearly 50 a share if 
assets are sold and proceeds go to shareholders

in a country of business giants 
deutsche bank chief alfred herrhausen towered over the rest 
herrhausen 59 was killed thursday by a bomb as he was being 
driven to work the terrorist red army faction claimed 
responsibility 
herrhausen was a friend and economic adviser to chancellor 
helmut kohl who was in tears over the murder kohl often sought 
herrhausens advice and asked the banker to accompany him on 
several foreign trips 
herrhausens voice articulating a clear vision of the need for 
expansion and new fields of business was the most influential in 
the business circles of west germany europes largest exporting 
nation 
he was a towering presence in the international financial 
community merrill lynch amp co chairman william a schreyer said 
in a statement in new york mr herrhausen combined warmth of 
character with consummate banking skills and en extraordinary 
vision of world affairs 
deutsche bank is not without a head but it will be without a 
brilliant voice for a while said thomas albrecht an analyst 
with londons ubs phillips and drew the brokerage unit of the 
union bank of switzerland 
herrhausen had expanded the reach of west germanys largest bank 
throughout western europe and was broadening the banks securities 
and corporate finance business in new york and tokyo 
under herrhausen the frankfurtbased deutsche bank has been 
expanding aggressively in western europe preparing for a leading 
role as the common market moves toward a barrierfree internal 
market of 1992 
efforts to gain a foothold in investment banking culminated this 
week in the 640 million takeover bid for the british investment 
bank morgan grenfell group plc 
deutsche bank has also acquired major operating interests in 
spain and italy and was one of the first west german companies to 
be quoted on the tokyo stock exchange 
his next goal was eastern europe although he had words of 
caution for west german businesses seeking to expand in the 
reformminded countries of the soviet bloc 
herrhausen repeatedly had called for a restructuring of the 
massive debts of third world nations 
during soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs visit to bonn in 
june herrhausen said it could take 20 years or more for the 
outmoded soviet economy to achieve western standards he put the 
time at five to 10 years for east germany 
herrhausen engineered the largest industrial restructuring in 
west german history the merger of daimlerbenz with aerospace 
giant messerschmittboelkowblohm 
he used the banks 28 percent share in the countrys no 1 
conglomerate daimlerbenz to push the behemoth behind cars and 
trucks into electronics aerospace and even outer space ventures 
kohl praised herrhausens sense of social responsiblity perhaps 
a reflection of the bank chiefs lifelong devotion to philosophy 
herrhausen was concerned by the publics lack of knowledge about 
the huge financial deals taking place in the banks twin glimmering 
towers overlooking frankfurt and brought in a former radio 
executive to improve communication with ordinary citizens 
abroad herrhausen was one of the shining examples of german 
management said thomas schiessle a banking analyst with the 
berliner handelsund frankfurter bank as such he was an 
exceptional figure who cannot be replaced 
herrhausen was born on jan 30 1930 in essen in the grimy ruhr 
industrial area and attended a bavarian school called the napola 
set up by the nazis for gifted children 
he graduated from the university of cologne with a degree in 
economics and business and later received a doctorate in economics 
herrhausen originally pursued a career in industry working as a 
manager at ruhrgas ag west germanys largest gas company he also 
worked as board member at vereinigte elektrizitaetswerke ag a 
power company 
in 1969 he was recruited by the deutsche bank where he worked 
in the economics department and in its important north american 
operations he become cochairman in 1985 and the sole chairman in 
1988 
he is survived by a wife and two daughters

mixed

personal income rose 09 percent in october and rumors that 
purchasing executives in chicago believed the economy was 
weakening said marc chandler a currency market analyst with mms 
international in chicago 
both developments didnt contradict the idea that the us 
economy continued to slow down chandler said 
when the economy slows financial markets expect the federal 
reserve to nudge interest rates lower declining rates make the 
dollar less attractive and the us currency tends to fall when 
yields decline

and the national association of purchasing managements monthly 
assessment of the economy

strong fundamental data in order for it to rally chandler said 
overseas dealers said the dollar fell sharply late in the day on 
rumors that fed chairman alan greenspan was resigning because of 
his onetime consulting role with the troubled lincoln savings and 
loan association 
joe coyne a fed spokesman said the rumors were absolutely 
not true and the denial helped steady the dollar somewhat 
there was brief dollar buying early in the day after the 
assassination of deutsche bank chairman alfred herrhausen the 
overseas traders said they said the buying focused on the 
potentially destabilizing effect a new wave of terrorism would have 
on west germany and its economy

pork belly futures prices plunged the permitted daily limit for 
the third straight day thursday on the chicago mercantile exchange 
as traders disappointed by the low level of exports fled the 
collapsing market 
livestock futures finished mixed on the merc 
on other commodity markets gold futures rebounded after three 
days of losses energy futures rallied and grains and soybeans 
were mostly higher 
frozen pork belly futures settled 40 cent to the limit 2 cents 
lower with the contract for delivery in february down 2 cents at 
5855 cents a pound 
in livestock trading live cattle futures settled 05 cent to 
25 cent lower with december at 7497 cents a pound feeder cattle 
were 05 cent to 20 cent lower with january at 8262 cents a 
pound live hogs were 13 cent to 33 cent higher with december at 
5085 cents a pound 
the february pork belly contract has lost more 6 cents or 96 
percent of its value so far this week after rising sharply during 
the past two months amid the excitement surrounding the political 
changes occurring in eastern europe 
the rally got its start with the bush administrations pledge of 
food aid to poland a package that was to include up to 20 million 
pounds of pork bellies the part of the hog from which bacon is 
made 
yugoslavias purchase of 150000 pounds of bellies in late 
october helped the rally along as did indications that the soviet 
union was interested in buying us bellies 
all of a sudden it seemed like we were going to be sending 
bellies all over the world said thomas morgan president of 
sterling research corp in arlington heights ill but if you get 
the price up high enough everyone backs away 
the government has purchased a paltry 12 million pounds of 
bellies so far and a merc report on tuesday showed bellies piling 
up in commercial freezers at a rapid pace an indication of slack 
demand for bacon 
analysts said the selloff was inevitable after so strong a 
rally the market had recorded two consecutive days of limit gains 
on oct 31 and nov 1 
when something goes up the way this market did its going to 
come down the same way said dale durchholz an analyst with 
agrivisor services inc in bloomington ill 
precious metals prices rebounded on new yorks commodity 
exchange taking back some of the ground lost wednesday 
the gold market which had fallen for the three previous 
sessions posted modest gains on buying by bargain hunters and 
speculators whose interest was piqued by the weaker dollar and the 
rise in oil prices 
gold futures settled 210 to 270 higher with december at 
41160 a troy ounce silver was 59 cents to 68 cents higher with 
december at 5668 a troy ounce 
surging demand for heating oil drove energy futures up sharply 
on the new york mercantile exchange 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 21 cents to 52 cents 
higher with january at 1989 a barrel heating oil was 65 cent to 
210 cents higher with the december contract expiring at 6271 a

corn and soybean futures prices ended mostly higher on the 
chicago board of trade amid indications the soviet union bought 2 
million to 4 million metric tons of us corn 
after the close the agriculture department announced sales of 
14 million metric tons of corn and 150000 metric tons of soybean 
meal to the soviets

purchasing agency figures which supposedly are lower than in recent 
months said charles jensen chief technical analyst for mki

anheuserbusch inc said thursday that it is 
increasing the availability of its nonalcoholic beer just in time 
for the holiday season 
there are many situations where a nonalcohol malt beverage 
might be preferred such as during business lunches or while 
participating in athletic events said bob merz group brand 
director for odouls nonalcoholic brew 
and with the holidays just around the corner it might also be 
preferred when consumers know they will be driving he said 
odouls has been testmarketed since march in cities in 
missouri florida alabama and georgia it will be made available 
in december in all or part of 12 other states and the district of 
columbia the company said 
anheuserbusch the worlds largest brewery is one of several 
breweries that have recently introduced nonalcoholic beers 
milwaukeebased miller brewing co for instance announced 
plans in october to offer its sharps nonalcoholic brew for sale 
nationwide by jan 1 
david krishock new products category director for miller said 
growth in the nonalcoholic beer market prompted miller to bring 
sharps out nationwide without test marketing 
annual us production of nonalcoholic beers is about a million 
barrels a year compared with the national beer market of more than 
182 million barrels but the nonalcoholic segment is growing at 
the rate of 10 percent to 15 percent a year while the overall beer 
market has been stable analysts said 
the introduction of nonalcoholic beers is seen as a response to 
a growing antidrinking sentiment as well as to offset sluggish 
beer sales with a wider variety of products 
it has been our marketing philosophy to present the beer 
consumer with a broad range of alternatives in terms of beer tastes 
and beer types said michael j roarty executive vice president 
and director of marketing for anheuserbusch 
anheuserbusch the brewing arm of anheuserbusch cos inc 
said odouls would be available beginning dec 4 in los angeles 
san francisco san diego and sacramento calif philadelphia 
minneapolis phoenix hartford conn washington dc and st 
louis 
odouls sold in sixpacks of 12ounce cans and longneck 
bottles also will be rolled out statewide in delaware 
massachusetts virginia north carolina south carolina oregon and 
washington 
odouls contains less than 05 percent alcohol by volume 
about the same amount found in soft drinks and fruit juices the

r lifland in new york notes that violators of the order could be 
fined or jailed for contempt

atlanta and new yorks laguardia airport and stems from hearings 
conducted by lifland in new york from march 22 to oct 4 
we consider this a very significant order said eastern

threatening behavior will not be tolerated and they will have to 
pay the price for their actions

problems between eastern workers and machinists since the strike

reorganization five days later 
on sunday seven strikers were arrested in atlanta after pickets 
pelted cars with rocks and injured one eastern worker lifland on 
wednesday ordered 13 machinists to appear at a dec 12 hearing on 
possible civil contempt charges

a jury found amtrak guilty thursday of 
dumping raw sewage into florida waterways in the national rail 
passenger lines first such criminal trial 
the state filed charges after amtrak refused to stop dumping raw 
human wastes from moving trains onto the tracks and into the st 
johns river and rice creek 
the sixmember jury deliberated 1 hours thursday before 
returning a guilty verdict on four counts of commercial littering 
amtrak contended federal law exempts it from state pollution 
control laws the dumping practice dating back more than a 
century has also come under fire in several western states 
im surprised and disappointed in the verdict said amtraks 
attorney edward booth of jacksonville i think its unfair for 
the law to send mixed signals 
booth said amtrak would appeal the decision just as quick as 
youre looking at daylight 
amtrak also faced one count of creating or allowing a nuisance 
to health but 7th circuit judge robert perry remanded it to putnam 
county court saying that prosecutors failed to prove anyones 
health was endangered a trial on that count will be set later 
amtrak has 20 days to file a motion for a new trial on the 
littering convictions sentencing was set for jan 19 amtrak could 
be prohibited from dumping and fined up to 5000 on each count 
the charges also carry a possible prison term of five years on each 
count though no individual was named in the case 
we are asking for injunction immediately to stop amtrak from 
dumping said state attorney john tanner but its obvious 
that the judge is not going to act until the sentencing date 
the federally supported passenger railroad had threatened to 
suspend service to florida where it serves about 1 million 
passengers a year if the state continued pressing its case 
however jeff moon assistant general counsel for amtrak said 
following the verdict that no decision has been made to pull the 
rail service out of florida 
tanner earlier had indicated if a guilty verdict were returned 
i dont think it will immediately affect rail service in florida 
i think in the long run it will ultimately lead to the end of the 
practice of dumping sewage in the waterways throughout the 
country 
many of amtraks 600 passenger cars dispose of sewage either by 
dumping directly onto the tracks when toilets are flushed or by 
spraying the contents of 30gallon holding tanks when the trains 
are traveling at least 35 miles per hour 
in his closing argument booth admitted amtrak had dumped human 
waste on bridges crossing waterways in putnam county but said the 
practice was allowed under federal law 
the company said in a federal court motion in jacksonville that 
enforcement of the state law would impose undue burdens on amtrak 
but no hearings were held on the motion and perry refused to delay 
trial pending a federal ruling 
the defense called amtraks president and chief executive 
officer w graham claytor jr as their only witness during the 
weeklong trial claytor said amtrak recognized the dumping 
problem but that the federally funded rail line could do little 
until congress appropriated more money for holding tanks or new 
cars 
claytor estimated it would take about 1 million to equip the 
current cars with the new system or 2 million to install it in new 
cars 
the prosecution said amtrak could not hide behind the law passed 
by congress in 1976 and ignore environmental laws in florida 
congress needs to know the state of florida will not allow 
amtrak the federal government to dump raw sewage in the waters 
of florida tanner said they amtrak are trying to stretch 
the law to say something it doesnt
