were burned beyond recognition when three italian jets collided on 
a lowlevel stunt flight and one of them hurtled into the crowd in 
a ball of flame 
people ran in panic many with clothes in tatters and large 
burns on their bodies 
most of the more than 300000 spectators at the annual air show 
were west germans and americans and about 500 were injured the 
identities of the dead were not released but at least 11 americans 
were critically burned 
some were missing skin on their arms the sun had come out 
and there were a lot of people who didnt have their shirts on a 
lot had black burns like their skin was burned black said 
deedee arrington doke a reporter for the unofficial us military 
newspaper stars and stripes who was at the scene 
john flanagan an air force sergeant told stars and stripes 
i saw this little boy just standing there his hair was all 
singed and the skin was coming off his face and he was just 
standing there looking up at me 
nobody stopped to help him they were running we stopped the 
police and the police picked him up 
the disaster occurred as an italian air force flying team in 10 
jets two groups of five each performed a complicated maneuver 
less than 200 feet off the ground shortly before 4 pm 
jim beichler a university of maryland teacher told the paper 
someone next to him had looked at one of the the italian planes and 
said hes going to hit hes not going to make it 
the plane blew up and people started running beichler 
said one guy was on fire other people were wrapped up in barbed 
wire there were small fires all around me 
a ball of flame 200 feet high and equally wide raced toward the 
crowd after the crash that killed the three italian pilots 
sgt eddie lee a spokesman for ramstein said officials were 
having trouble identifying the dead and a list of victims would not 
be released until tuesday 
eleven americans are in critical condition at a us military 
hospital in landstuhl lee said adding that there could be more 
such cases in other hospital 
the ard television network said the 345 people reported 
seriously injured included about 50 critically burned and suedwest 
radio said many of those in critical condition are in danger of 
dying 
in santa barbara calif where president reagan is vacationing 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we are deeply 
saddened by the tragic accident he said the president was 
sending messages of condolence to the victims families 
investigators still were trying to determine what caused the 
tragedy which involved three plans in the highlight performance of 
the ramstein air show 
two jets rammed each other from opposite directions and the 
third italian mb339a plowed into a row of cars and buses 
dr william flannery a us military doctor supervising 
treatment said the hardest part was calming relatives of the 
many children killed or injured he spoke at a news conference at 
the army hospital in landstuhl near ramstein 
quoting american officials the us militarys afn radio 
network said fortysix people were killed about 500 people were 
injured 
rudolf tartter head of the local government district that 
includes ramstein said west german officials put the death count 
at 45 one below the us toll there was no explanation for the 
discrepancy 
of those injured 345 are seriously injured tartter said 
gen william l kirk head of the us air force in europe 
issued a statement saying we in us air forces in europe 
express our grief over the tragic incident at ramstein air base 
germany 
defense minister rupert scholz said officials will study ways 
for west germany and its nato allies to demonstrate their air 
forces abilities without endangering spectators 
until suggestions for effective measures are complete there 
will not be any more air shows with military aircraft in west 
germany this with the agreement of the air forces of our nato 
allies scholz announced 
he also said west german military aircraft would not participate 
in stuntflying performances and canceled an air show scheduled for 
sept 25 
on a special program of the zdf television network monday night 
scholz said his order on stuntflying demonstrations at air shows 
would affect only the west german military 
i have made the decision that aerobatic flying can no longer 
be considered scholz said but it is obvious that i can make 
this decision only for the west german armed forces 
us ambassador richard burt speaking on the same program 
indicated the united states might adopt its own ban on stuntflying 
exhibitions at air shows at its bases in west germany 
we are very open minded about whether there will be future 
aerobatic shows burt said the united states will do all it 
can to make sure such a tragedy never happens again 
in brussels a nato spokesman said privately the western 
alliance as a body does not organize such air shows the 
organization of air shows and participation in them is a matter for 
discussion between host nations or air forces and those invited to 
take part 
alfred mechtersmeier a leader of the environmentalist greens 
party demanded the ouster of scholz following the accident he 
bears the primary responsibility for the ramstein catastrophe 
said mechtersmeier whose party also is known for its staunch 
antinato stance 
a dozen protesters had held up banners outside the ramstein 
gates sunday as the spectators poured in to watch the stunt flights 
at europes largest military airport 
italys defense ministry said the frecce tricolori tricolor 
arrows aerobatic team would continue performing but would limit 
its activities to flyovers

an ivory pomegranate believed to be the only 
existing relic of solomons temple has gone on display at the 
israel museum after officials paid 550000 into a secret swiss 
bank account 
the thumbsized object which measures 168 inches by 83 
inches has a hole in the bottom and may have been used as the top 
of a scepter carried by a temple priest 
we have never had anything that was in solomons temple 
minuscule as it is this is an exquisite treasure said meir 
meyer vice chairman of the museum 
a museum official who demanded anonymity said the money was paid 
to the secret account of an anonymous owner in zurich switzerland 
after the museum raised the money from an anonymous donor in basel 
the creamcolored relic which dates to the 8th century bc and 
is badly chipped on one side was returned to israel last week 
after it was apparently smuggled out of the country after 1979 
it is the only exhibit in a long narrow room displayed in a 
case with a dim light to prevent damage to the ivory 
an armed guard stood nearby as workers rushed to finalize 
details of the exhibit before the object was placed on display 
monday 
officials said they were reluctant to spend so much money to 
return the pomegranate but agreed to do so after two months of 
negotiations because it was a national treasure 
the question is whether to bring it back or leave it of 
course any object that has such high historical and cultural value 
should be brought back said nahman avigad a hebrew university 
archaeologist who authenticated the pomegranate 
avigad said in all probability it was used in the ancient 
temple which was looted and destroyed by the bablylonians in 589 
bc 
thus the pomegranate is likely part of the great treasure of 
gold ivory and precious objects that king solomon invested in the 
temple which was built about 960 bc and housed the ark of the 
covenant two stone tablets containing the law of moses 
the temple was rebuilt in the 6th century bc and expanded by 
herod before being destroyed in ad 70 today the dome of the 
rock a moslem shrine that is part of the al aqsa complex is 
located near the site of ancient temple according to israeli 
scholars 
written on the pomegranate in ancient hebrew is an inscription 
that says belonging to the temple of the lord yahweh holy to 
the priests 
meyer said it was the oldest hebrew inscription using the name 
of god predating by at least 100 years two silver scrolls with 
biblical inscriptions found in jerusalem a decade ago 
meyer said he had been tracking the pomegranate since hearing 
about it in 1985 he said a tour guide walked into his office in 
1987 and put him in touch with a lawyer for the anonymous owner 
the pomegranate first came to light in 1979 when andre lemaire 
a french expert on ancient inscriptions stumbled on the relic in 
the shop of a jerusalem antiquities dealer 
lemaire of paris wrote in a 1984 article for the biblical 
archaeology review that the dealer only showed him the pomegranate 
so he could photograph it 
lemaire said the dealer did not know where the pomegranate was 
found but lemaire speculated it may have been unearthed in the 
limestone caves surrounding jerusalem which were often used for 
tombs 
the pomegranate next turned up in an exhibition in paris in 1985 
and then disappeared again 
israeli laws ban excavation or the export of antiquities without 
a permit from the education ministrys department of antiquities 
officials are currently drafting proposed legislation to tighten 
controls and virtually outlaw antiquities trading

forest fires have 
engulfed nearly onequarter of the nations oldest national park 
but only three small buildings have been lost and even with the 
blackened forests and thick smoke yellowstone hasnt lost its 
majesty 
the series of ferocious fires have so far spared the major 
tourist attractions at the grand 116yearold matriach of the 
parks although one fire still causes concern for the safety of the 
facilities around old faithful geyser 
scorched tree trunks punctuate some camping and picnic areas and 
some hiking trails have been lost along with a comfort station 
outhouse and historic cabin 
a total of more than 450000 of the parks 22 million acres 
have been swept by the worst fires in the area in at least 200 
years 
but flames so far have been successfully diverted around 
buildings and monuments power lines and some cabins have been 
saved under the protection of fireproof blankets 
and already officials are planning the rebuilding and talking to 
potential visitors about next year when grassy meadows will 
sprout where dense forest used to be 
yellowstone will be a different kind of yellowstone in the 
future it certainly will be a living testament to the most 
powerful forces in nature said park spokeswoman joan anzelmo 
on a scale of one to 10 i guess id say the condition of the 
park is an eight but we still have at least four more weeks of 
drought conditions and the fires continue to spread she said 
yellowstone which is the size of delaware and rhode island 
combined and is visited by more than 2 million people a year still 
has more than one million acres of untouched lodgepole pine 
wildlife like buffalo elk and bears have escaped unharmed and 
still could be seen grazing along some roads monday park rangers 
estimate that in areas where fastmoving flames jumped around only 
50 percent of the vegetation was lost 
the park isnt entirely black spokeswoman amy vanderbilt 
said 
yet several roads remain closed because of the danger of falling 
trees in some areas the thick pungent smoke painted a white 
sheet over colorful mountain vistas 
and about half of the camp grounds and hotels have been shut 
down not because of damage but because of proximity to danger and 
lack of tourists 
eight major fires continued burning monday in yellowstone and 
several others blazed in national forests on the perimeter 
while it will take decades of mature trees to return to damaged 
areas fires spark a rebirth in the forest and are actually 
beneficial for its ecological cycle by allowing new growth 
and it is that rebirth that park service officials hope will 
draw tourists back to yellowstone next year 
well be very aggressive in communicating with people that 
yellowstone is still here and still has an awful lot for visitors 
to see and do ms vanderbilt said

san francisco a mexican charged with the torturemurder of a 
us drug agent won a legal victory in a separate drug case monday 
when a federal appeals court ruled searches by us police in 
foreign countries are subject to constitutional limits 
the constitution imposes substantive constraints on the 
federal government even when it operates abroad said the 9th 
us circuit court of appeals in a 21 ruling 
the court said a january 1986 search of rene verdugo urquidezs 
home in mexicali mexico by us drug agents and mexican police 
violated the us constitutional ban on unreasonable searches 
because agents had no warrant and were not acting in an emergency 
as a result an alleged drug tally sheet seized cant be used as 
evidence in a us trial against verdugo on drug charges the court 
said 
dissenting judge j clifford wallace said constitutional 
standards do not apply to searches of aliens abroad the american 
flag simply does not follow nonresident aliens beyond our 
territorial limits he said 
at the time of the search verdugo was in a us jail awaiting 
trial along with two other men in the february 1985 murder of us 
drug enforcement administration agent enrique camarena us 
officials say camarena was kidnapped outside the us consulate in 
guadalajara mexico and taken to the home of mexican drug lord 
rafael caro quintero where he was tortured and killed 
verdugo 36 and the other two men are being tried for the 
murder in los angeles federal court four other defendants 
including caro quintero are in jail in mexico 
the drug case charging a conspiracy to import marijuana is in 
pretrial proceedings in federal court in san diego verdugos 
lawyer michael pancer said monday the evidence seized in the 
search was relatively insignificant but the legal principle was 
important 
for years our agents have been running around in foreign 
countries acting in total disregard of the united states 
constitution and commonly accepted standards of morality by 
adopting the standards of the country they were in he said 
this decision will go a long way toward restoring a sense of 
law and order to the manner in which our agents conduct themselves 
in foreign countries 
although us officers should be able to comply with a search 
warrant requirement the problem is that we are not in control of 
the search beyond that assistant us attorney roger haines 
said theres no reason why the foreign officials should be 
interested in complying with american law 
the court said the search took place a day after verdugo was 
arrested by mexican police in baja california and delivered to us 
agents in california 
a dea agent ordered the search by four agents accompanied by a 
team of mexican federal judicial police whose participation was 
approved by their commander the court said no warrant was sought 
in advance from a us magistrate the search was directed by the 
dea officers who took charge of the evidence the court said 
it is clear that the dea controlled the operation said the 
opinion by judge david thompson 
upholding a ruling by us district judge j lawrence irving 
thompson said the search was subject to fourth amendment 
constitutional standards because it was directed by us officers 
for a trial in the united states

the nations founding fathers sired more than 
their country according to a historian who says sex was a mainstay 
of courtship in the revolutionary war era and often resulted in 
premarital pregnancy 
judging from birth and marriage records americans in the late 
1700s were more licentious than we imagine them to be jack 
larkin writes in american heritage magazines septemberoctober 
issue 
larkin cites records of several dozen communities to prove that 
in the late 18th century pregnancy was frequently a prelude to 
marriage 
the proportion of women pregnant at their weddings had been 
rising since the late 1600s and peaked in the decades during and 
after the revolution in rural new england towns like sturbridge 
mass nearly a third of brides already were with child 
people today tend to assume weve reached the ultimate level 
of moral looseness and that you can look back through our history 
at a steadily rising level of immorality building up to the 
present larkin said in an interview but in fact these things 
have gone in cycles 
the concept of randy revolutionaries is particularly surprising 
in straitlaced new england considering the popular notion of 
what puritanism was all about he said 
seventeenthcentury new england was indeed a strict society but 
sexual freedom began to increase as the region became more socially 
and economically diverse and as resistance to british rule spread 
through the colonies in the late 1700s all hell broke loose 
he said 
but salem was no sodom and gloucester wasnt a gomorrah 
pregnancies usually simply accelerated a marriage that would have 
taken place in any case larkin writes most rural communities 
simply accepted the early pregnancies that marked so many 
marriages 
larkin is chief historian at old sturbridge village a 
recreation of an 18th century village and author of the 
reshaping of everyday life in the united states 17901840 to be 
published this fall by harper amp row 
when early american communities did censure premarital 
pregnancy it often was more a matter of economics than morals the 
rule as enunciated by asa lincoln justice of the peace in 
brimfield mass was born a bastard and chargeable to the 
town 
accordingly if a woman were still unmarried when she gave 
birth officials might interrogate her during labor about the 
fathers identity not as much to condemn him as to get him to 
support his child 
sexual mores began to change in the 1820s larkin says as the 
turbulent war years receded and society became more settled and 
strict 
community records in this period show that the proportion of 
women who conceived a child before marriage steadily declined by 
1840 the premarital pregnancy rate in new england towns dropped 
from nearly one pregnant bride in three to one in five or six in 
some places prenuptial pregnancy dropped to 5 percent 
for many americans this marked the acceptance of new limits on 
sexual behavior imposed not by their parents or other authorities 
but by themselves larkin writes 
they were marrying later than their parents often living 
through long engagements while the husbandtobe strove to 
establish his place in the world they chose not to risk a 
pregnancy that would precipitate them into an early marriage 
such points larkin said are hard to make at a family place 
like old sturbridge village in sturbridge mass 
thats why i wrote the book he explained some things are 
hard to show in a museum

for the people of this town near 
the biggest us air base in europe sundays stunt crash was a 
disaster waiting to happen and made worse because it was just 
taking risks for a show not a war 
we have an air show every day here stephanie antes 26 
said of the warplanes that roar over ramstein daily from the base 
but this has to be the last time they it do it for a display 
more than 24 hours after the tragedy in which three italian 
stunt aircraft collided killing more than 40 people and injuring 
hundreds as one plowed into the crowd in a ball of flames ramstein 
has gone quiet 
few people were on the streets monday evening the bars were 
halfempty and the talk was loaded with resentment 
there was also a strong sense of just being lucky 
heike griebhammer a 20yearold bar attendant left the air 
show just 10 minutes before the crash her aunt and a 3yearold 
cousin sarah griebhammer stayed on 
the child was caught on the edge of the ball of flame but she 
too was among the lucky ones her mother scooped her up and the 
child escaped with a badly singed arm said miss griebhammer 
ive always thought something would happen she said its 
only afterward that you wonder why you went to the show at all 
this town of 8000 relies heavily on revenues from the sprawling 
air base about half a mile from ramsteins modest business district 
one establishment the diebglocker bar does a brisk business 
from ramstein air shows 
but on sunday afternoon instead of coming in for a drink and a 
meal hundreds of people poured in trying to telephone friends and 
relatives after the accident 
it was just terrible said coowner helga pisani it 
doesnt matter what it means for the business we dont want 
another show here 
but her husband salvatore pisani an italian who settled in 
ramstein 25 years ago said the shows should go on 
it was just chance it was fate said pisani 
france hausladen 74 recalled 25 years of hearing the jets roar 
overhead since he moved to ramstein 
they do it thousands of times and its all right but sooner 
or later there was going to be a disaster said hausladen 
people thousands of people want to see these things and 
nobody makes them go but it is all so unnecessary 
some residents were cynical over the question whether people 
would lose their enthusiasm for the popular shows 
theres a big fuss now but in six weeks it will probably be 
forgotten said uwe prien a 28yearold sign painter who learned 
of the disaster while driving home from a vacation 
i almost didnt want to get here i just thought what if its 
my family said prien my brother was at the show but he was 
all right he was lucky 
despite the shock and horror left by the tragedy few people 
seemed to have let it affect the good feelings they have about the 
americans living next door 
we dont resent the americans theyve been here for such a 
long time theyre really part of us said miss antes this is 
as bad for them as it is for us 
but yesterday they were just taking risks for a show not a 
war she said

the ceasefire between iran and iraq is less 
than two weeks old but the battered city of basra already is 
showing signs of recovery 
over the weekend men and boys in white galabia robes sat atop 
sandbags lining the shattalarab waterway and cast lines baited 
with sesame paste into the murky green waters clogged with sunken 
freighters 
not far away young swimmers did backflips into the canals that 
cut through the city toward the shattalarab which forms the 
southern border with iran a welder patched a gate at the sheraton 
hotel heavily damaged by artillery shells 
in the citys main square sandbags fortified the walls of the 
alhamdan hotel and its lobby was covered with jagged shrapnel 
holes but the staff said all the rooms were taken booked by a 
teachers convention and kuwaitis returning to examine the city 
where they once spent vacations 
such signs of recovery are noteworthy in a city only 15 miles 
from irans border which came under relentless artillery and 
missiles fire 
the attacks on iraqs only port city during the eightyear war 
damaged virtually every building in central basra where the 
pounding was so intense at times that dozens of shells landed every 
minute 
the city was nearly captured in february 1987 when iranian 
fighters poured across the border and came within six miles of 
basra in the fierce fighting that followed the iranians were 
decimated and according to us defense analysts suffered 25000 
casualties including 15000 dead 
hundreds of thousands fled the city of more than 1 million peope 
at the height of the shelling and missile attacks from december 
1986 to february 1987 
basra governor anwar sayid said recently that the shelling 
killed 1000 civilians and wounded 2000 
the attacks stopped earlier this year when a series of iraqi 
victories pushed the iranian guns out of range 
iraqis soon began returning to the city and the population is 
now back to about 1 million sayid said many have begun rebuilding 
homes but reporters touring the city this weekend found a few 
areas still nearly deserted 
even the pristine basra airport reopened hours after the aug 
20 ceasefire resembles a massive mausoleum with its granite 
floors and marble walls so far only one flight a day arrives and 
departs 
the shrapnelscarred shattalarab hotel was reopened after 
eight years to serve as sector headquarter for united nations truce 
observers 
there have been no problems up to now danish maj jaspar 
boysen said as he sat in the 1930sera lobby beneath a twirling 
ceiling fan other observers sank into the worn armchairs nearby 
chatting and working at postcards to escape the heat in their 
poorly airconditioned rooms 
sandbags and coils of barbed wire lined the shattalarab 
waterway outside by its banks scores of rusting freighters 
trapped eight years ago by the war were anchored two abreast the 
governor said it would probaby take two years to clear the shatt of 
builtup silt and sunken hulks 
the governor said many people are returning and rebuilding 
carrying truckloads of belongings back to their damaged homes 
sayid said the government is financing home repairs rebuilding 
schools and hospitals working on a new water system and planning 
to renovate the electrical grid 
i am sure that if you visit it after two months you could 
never imagine the city experienced the war he said

an estimated 738000 divorced women got married 
again last year but a study suggests that remarriage will come 
late or never for many women who recently separated 
half the women who separated in the early 1980s will remain 
single seven years later and about 40 percent who were in their 
30s when they divorced will never remarry the study says 
for those 40 or older about 70 percent will never return to the 
altar the estimates say and only 46 percent of black women who 
separated during that period are expected to remarry compared with 
76 percent for nonhispanic white women 
the estimates imply long periods of single life and possible 
economic hardship for some women and their children said 
researchers from the university of wisconsin at madison 
for many of the children its the rest of their childhood 
years said coauthor larry bumpass for many of these women 
its for the rest of their lives 
bumpass a sociology professor developed the projections with 
colleagues james sweet and teresa castro he spoke in a telephone 
interview before presenting the study sunday in atlanta at the 
annual meeting of the american sociological association 
its a very important study and its very well done said 
barbara foley wilson a marriage trends researcher at the national 
center for health statistics 
the projections assume that remarriage trends observed during 
the early 1980s will continue for 20 years but remarriage rates 
have been declining so the projections may turn out to 
overestimate remarriages bumpass said 
he also said the projections do not differentiate between women 
who seek to remarry and those who do not nor do they count as 
remarried women who are simply living with a man 
the projections were developed from analyzing a 1985 federal 
survey that included 2700 women the analysis focused on women 
because information on marital histories is more accurate for women 
than men bumpass said 
the calculations assume that if a woman has not remarried within 
20 years of the separation she will never do so studies show only 
a relatively tiny proportion marry after that time 
overall 72 percent of women who separated in the early 1980s 
will remarry the projections suggest 
that includes 89 percent of women who were younger than 25 when 
they separated the percentage drops to 79 percent for ages 25 to 
29 59 percent for ages 30 to 39 and 31 percent for 40 and older 
the researchers decided that separation would be the best 
indicator of when a marriage ended because extraneous factors can 
delay divorces 
bumpass attributed the trend to a shrinking marriage market 
as women age created by a progressive decrease in supply of 
available older men plus a preference by men to marry younger women 
but wilson said an agerelated decline in remarriage rates also 
shows up for men 
perhaps marriage becomes less attractive for older people who 
have already had a family and whose children provide companionship 
they might otherwise seek in a spouse she said older women also 
may have to spend energy caring for elderly parents she said 
overall 81 percent of women who had no children when they 
separated were expected to remarry the rate dips to 73 percent for 
women who had one or two children and 57 percent for those with at 
least three 
one reason is that women with more children tend to be older 
researchers said but when that was accounted for statistically 
children still reduced the prospect of remarriage in the study in 
agreement with past research 
its just harder to get out and date bumpass said children 
also present a potential mate with added costs and social 
responsibility he said 
women who were younger when they first married also tended to 
show higher projected rates of remarriage ranging from 84 percent 
for women who were 14 to 17 at their first wedding to 51 percent 
for women who were 23 and older

nearly 1700 israeli buses have been damaged by 
stones and firebombs in the palestinian uprising and those that 
pass through the west bank are now being equipped with 
shatterproof windows officials say 
executives of the egged bus cooperative also said sunday that if 
attacks continue at the current rate the company will not be able 
to maintain service to the west bank without additional government 
funds 
we are almost the only link between the jewish settlements 
in the west bank and israel shlomo levine secretary general of 
egged told reporters the service we provide is also a sign of 
israeli presence no less than the settlers 
since the dec 8 start of the uprising in lands israel seized in 
the 1967 middle east war all egged drivers have been given pistols 
for trips in the occupied west bank on especially dangerous 
routes the army provides escorts 
according to egged figures 188 passengers and 24 drivers have 
been injured in stoning attacks in the past nine months in one 
case an egged driver opened fire on arab stonethrowers at a 
refugee camp outside jericho killing one of the youths 
most buses of the 1650 damaged buses were hit by stones while 
39 were torched by firebombs 
egged is now avoiding some trouble spots such as the northern 
west bank city of tulkarem the company has also adjusted its 
schedule in some cases for example buses wont pass certain 
dangerous areas after moslem friday noon prayers traditionally a 
spark for antiisraeli demonstrations 
in another attempt to provide greater security egged has 
equipped 10 buses with reinforced shatterproof windows the 
cooperative plans to eventually equip 190 buses with the stronger 
windows 
egged buses in the west bank mostly transport jewish settlers 
in the past they also carried arab workers picking them up in 
west bank villages and taking them to jobs in israel 
but two months into the uprising the army asked egged not to 
enter west bank villages saying the vehicles were too easy a 
target arab buses now take the workers to israel 
in a related development jewish settlers in the west bank are 
organizing armed escorts for school buses that will transport about 
1500 students when schools reopen in september israels 
transportation ministry said sunday

as a shakedown voyage sen dan quayles first 
solo campaign trip as the republican vice presidential nominee was 
rougher than most 
swamped by questions about his military record and his relations 
with a former lobbyist quayle began his week in an angry 
confrontation with reporters as he took out the garbage at his 
virginia home he also had to deal with talk that he should do 
george bush a favor and get off the ticket 
but by sunday quayle was predicting in an interview on his way 
home i will eventually be an asset to the ticket 
it was a tacit acknowledgement perhaps that the jury was still 
out 
even without the distractions of those questions quayle had 
trouble getting his message across and at times seemed to confound 
his aides 
he dispensed with prepared texts to the point that at an 
appearance before hundreds of senior citizens in california he 
neglected even to mention such issues as social security or 
medicare concentrating instead on child care 
in a discussion on gun control at a billings mont news 
conference quayle left the impression that he did not think felons 
should be subjected to background checks or other restrictions 
before being allowed to buy firearms his aides had to explain 
later that quayle meant to say that such restrictions should be 
left to the states not the federal government 
after meeting with farmers at the missouri state fair quayle 
was challenged by reporters to demonstrate that he understood the 
technicalities of the farm price support system his only response 
was i know quite a bit about farm policy i come from indiana 
which is a farm state 
asked to explain why he voted in previous years against 
droughtrelief legislation quayle could only say that he supported 
it this year and added i stand by my record 
then there was his vote against establishing a cabinetlevel 
position for the veterans administration quayle said he voted 
against it because he did not believe it would get the veterans 
more benefits or services but as for whether his vote was correct 
quayle left his questioners guessing by this response perhaps my 
vote was not the right vote i still think its the right vote 
there were other problems 
he blamed his staff for an error in his resume overstating the 
period in which he was indianas chief consumer investigator his 
college performance was admittedly average but quayle said he did 
not use undue influence to get into law school and would not in any 
case make his academic records public 
if some of his answers lacked depth or details if they seemed 
to suggest that the candidate was unsure that will change with 
time campaign strategists suggested 
this is my first national campaign its much different than 
running for the united states senate quayle conceded 
but his demeanor suggested that quayle was gaining confidence by 
weeks end his gestures became broader and he spoke with more 
sureness as he fended off unwelcome questions warmed to his stump 
themes and lashed out at michael dukakis 
youthful and telegenic he relished photo opportunities that 
allowed him to pitch hay ride a tractor and get licked in the face 
by a labrador retriever demonstrating that some things about the 
art of politicking never change 
quayle insists that more and more hell be able to get his 
message out 
i am going to continue to talk about the issues that affect 
america sooner or later the american people will hear what dan 
quayle feels about the issues sooner or later they will know 
where i stand

two senators conclude in a new book that vice 
president george bush endorsed the sale of weapons to iran they 
say he did so either out of loyalty to president reagan or because 
he too was consumed with the idea of freeing american 
hostages 
noting that the issue remains important because of bushs 
quest for the presidency sens william s cohen rmaine and 
george mitchell dmaine say the central question is exactly 
what were his thoughts about the propriety of the covert action 
itself and what steps if any did he take to satisfy himself about 
the potential consequences to the united states if it went 
forward 
for those questions they have no answers 
the two maine senators were members of the senate irancontra 
committee which with its house counterpart conducted hearings in 
the spring and summer of 1987 into the affair 
bush has said that although he was generally aware of the secret 
sale of arms to iran he was not involved in the implementation of 
the plan 
the two senators note that bush has often said he was out of 
the loop on the operation and was not aware that it involved arms 
for hostages until he was briefed by sen david durenberger 
rminn then chairman of the senate intelligence committee on 
dec 20 1986 almost a month after the affair had become 
public 
in their book men of zeal a candid inside story of the 
irancontra hearings the two senators recall testimony and 
documentary evidence indicating that bush was present at many 
meetings in which the secret arms sales were discussed 
they quote at length from a july 29 1986 memo written by 
bushs aide craig fuller describing a meeting between the vice 
president and amiran nir an israeli government terrorism expert 
which essentially described the operation in armsforhostages 
terms 
mitchell and cohen recount the early appearance of the issue in 
the presidential race noting that former secretary of state 
alexander m haig jr and other presidential contenders continually 
pressed bush on the issue 
haig they noted repeatedly asked this question the american 
people are entitled to know what position he bush took during 
this storm that imperiled our nations interests was he the 
copilot in the cockpit or was he back in economy class 
the two senators say however that the nature of the vice 
presidency itself may have distanced bush from the irancontra 
affair 
once elected the president and his top advisers relegate the 
vice president to the role of understudy to be informed of 
policies and events rather than actively involved in shaping 
them they write 
when the vice president seeks election to the presidency the 
perception of the vice president as working at the presidents 
right hand is at war with his distance from real decisionmaking in 
the white house 
bush has refused to disclose the substance of his discussions 
with the president about the secret arms sales 
it is possible that in those conversations bush cautioned the 
president against selling weapons to the iranians they said 
but they say that whatever doubts may exist about the nature of 
bushs role adm john poindexter the former national security 
adviser was convinced that the vice president supported the 
initiative 
they quote from a poindexter memo on feb 1 1986 stating that 
while some top officials still disagreed with the armsforhostages 
policy president and vp are solid in taking the position that we 
have to try 
vice president bush considered himself to be on the periphery 
of this major foreign policy decision in haigs terms more of a 
passenger than a copilot mitchell and cohen said 
but we think it fair to say that even if he were a copilot 
his position would have remained the same they said 
they note that in his heated exchange on the issue with cbs 
anchorman dan rather last jan 25 bush said i went along with 
it because you know why dan when i saw mr william 
buckley when i heard about mr buckley being tortured to death 
later admitted as a cia chief so if i erred i erred on the side 
of trying to get those hostages out of there 
the two senators conclusion the vice president endorsed the 
weapons sale to iran either out of loyalty to the president or 
because he too was consumed by the passion to obtain the freedom 
of the hostages

bank customers beginning this week will be 
guaranteed quicker access to their money under new federal 
regulations that are being hailed as a victory for consumers 
the expedited funds availability act was passed by congress in 
august 1987 and takes effect thursday under it banks savings and 
loans and credit unions must give customers access to deposited 
funds within one three or seven days depending on the type of the 
check 
consumer groups complained that too many banks were freezing 
funds for periods as long as two or three weeks in a practice that 
was costing americans millions of dollars banks frequently refer 
to the practice as putting a hold on deposited checks 
the us public interest research group said that banks were 
making 290 million annually in interest on the money they were 
withholding from customers during the socalled float period 
the time between when the bank got credit for the funds and when it 
released the money for use by the depositor 
additionally the consumer research group said banks were 
collecting another 145 million a year in bouncedcheck fees 
because funds were not released faster for depositors use 
shorter hold periods for checks are especially important to 
people on tight budgets or fixed incomes it will be a relief 
because they wont have checks bounce while their funds are tied 
up said leslie gainer a lobbyist for the consumer research 
group 
with certain exceptions the new law requires that local checks 
must be cleared by the bank within three business days a local 
check is one written on an institution in the same metropolitan 
area or within the same federal reserve check processing region 
nonlocal checks must be cleared within seven business days 
money deposited in the form of cashiers checks certified 
checks and government checks must be available to depositors by 9 
am on the next business day 
by sept 1 1990 the maximum hold period will drop to two days 
for local checks and five days for nonlocal checks 
bankers struggling to implement the new procedures are grumbling 
that the rules may be an invitation to fraud they say the new law 
will not give them enough time to make sure deposited checks dont 
bounce or were not forged especially in the case of the oneday 
deadline for certified checks 
implementation of the regulations is also proving costly the 
federal reserve is planning to spend 30 million over three years 
in new procedures and equipment to speed check processing money 
that will be recouped in higher processing fees charged to banks 
banks are spending their own money to train their employees and 
produce brochures to get word of the changes to customers that 
information must be in customers hands no later than oct 31 
while some of the expense undoubtedly will be passed on to 
customers in the form of higher fees consumer advocates say a 1986 
survey found that 20 percent of banks at the time were complying 
with the new guidelines suggesting that they were able to do so 
and still remain competitive in the fees they were charging for 
their services 
the new regulations required a 600page guide from the fed 
which dealt not only with the deadlines but such matters as how 
checks should be endorsed 
the endorsement guidelines which limit endorsements to the 
first 15 inches on the back of the check are proving to be a 
major headache for retail stores many businesses routinely stamp 
the backs of checks with a lengthy list of identification items 
store clerks must obtain from customers 
as a consequence many stores are rushing to buy new rubber 
stamps or reprogram cash registers to print within the smaller 
endorsement area 
fed officials defend the new endorsement requirements saying 
they are needed to speed the checkclearing process so that bounced 
checks can be returned quickly to the institution where they were 
cashed 
the goal is to get the check back before the institution 
releases the money

vice president george bush says hes encouraged 
but not complacent about his postconvention rise in public opinion 
polls 
the polls look good i cant say i believe them because im 
the guy that when they looked bad said i dont believe them bush 
said aboard air force two after a memorial service sunday for 
former texas gov price daniel in austin 
bushs standings have improved from a doubledigit lag behind 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis to a virtual dead 
heat in polls since the republican national convention two weeks 
ago in new orleans 
bush also said he feels good about his first campaign trip to 
texas since he became the republican presidential nominee 
weve had a good swing he said of the fourday trip to his 
adopted home state which his campaign has targeted as a key 
battleground for november ive got to work hard but its 
doable very very doable he said 
bush was traveling today from houston to st louis where he 
planned a tour of an aerospace plant and then to nashville for a 
rally and visit to the reserve officer training program at middle 
tennessee state university 
he returns to washington tonight for a series of day campaign 
trips to various states and may head west to california and 
colorado on the weekend 
asked if he was looking forward to debating dukakis he said 
only sure 
dukakis has ben pushing to begin the debates in september 
sooner than the bush campaign is willing to start bush said he was 
leaving arrangements to his campaign chairman james a baker iii 
baker is to meet with dukakis aide paul brountas on tuesday to 
discuss the debate schedule 
asked about results of opinion polling by his campaign bush 
said the figures were encouraging 
however he expressed caution about poll numbers as he has in 
the past 
i think its very encouraging the movement in the polls he 
said but again those things change so dramatically that we cant 
change our campaign game plan or anything based on the polls 
i cant deny that its encouraging but theres certainly 
nothing in there that makes me relax 
his goal he said is to continue trying to pin contrast dukakis 
with himself 
bushs last day of his texas was lowkey compared with the usual 
hectic pace of campaigning 
he went to an episcopal church service in houston attended an 
astros baseball game and flew to austin for the memorial service 
for former gov price daniel a longtime friend 
the bush campaign is trying to play up bushs credentials as a 
texan in light of competition from sen lloyd bentsen dukakis 
running mate 
bush a connecticut native moved to texas in the 1940s but has 
spent many of his adult years in washington 
talking to reporters aboard air force two chief of staff craig 
fuller said bush will continue to stress his promilitary views in 
the coming week and paint democratic rival michael dukakis as weak 
on defense a theme the campaign feels is going over well 
fuller said bush would likely return to texas by midseptember 
and in the meantime send surrogates and family members to work the 
state 
but bush told reporters he wasnt engaging in any politics on 
sunday 
the onetime captain of the yale baseball team showed off his 
pitching style throwing out the first ball in the astrodome for 
the houston astros game against the pittsburgh pirates

striking nurses at six hospitals voted 
sunday to end a fourweek walkout by approving a contract that will 
raise their pay three times over the next 34 months 
seventyseven percent of 1200 registered nurses who voted 
approved ratifying the agreement the union said the california 
nurses associations 2200 members have been on strike mainly over 
pay since aug 2 when they joined 1700 licensed vocational 
nurses and hospital service workers who walked off their jobs july 
26 they struck mainly over health benefits and went back to work 
wednesday 
the new contract would provide raises of 8 percent 7 percent 
and 6 percent over the life of the nurses contract and grant the 
increases a total of four months earlier than in a settlement 
rejected by a 21 margin on aug 19 the rejected 36month pact 
offered increases of 75 percent 65 percent and 6 percent 
under the contract a dayshift nurse at top scale will make 
2199 an hour by the end of the contract or 45700 a year 
nurses are expected to begin returning to work on wednesday 
said maureen anderson a cna spokeswoman 
karen henry chief negotiator fof the affiliated hospitals the 
group representing the affected medical facilities said sunday 
night that the contract accomplished the hospitals bargaining 
objectives she defined that mainly as avoiding large pay raises 
in a twoyear period 
its not everything every nurse wants but i think its 
probably enough to satisfy most nurses said rebecca morrow a 
nurse and picket captain at mount zion hospital 
karen sano a criticalcare nurse at mount zion disagreed she 
said a lot of nurses were not that pleased with the increase or 
the contract length many nurses expressed concern that the 
contract would prevent them from striking with local 250 of the 
hospital workers union if that union decides to strike when its new 
contract expires in two years 
the nurses negotiating committee unanimously endorsed the 
tentative settlement a week earlier it gave only 54 support to 
the proposal voted down on aug 19 
the nurses strike has targeted childrens marshal hale st 
marys st francis and mount zion hospitals in san francisco and 
seton medical center in daly city

a review of fruit vegetables and other 
highvalue crops watched closely by the agriculture department 
shows that the 1988 drought has trimmed some harvests but did 
little harm to others 
the drought disrupted normal production and marketing of 
midwestern processing vegetables dry beans sugar beets and tart 
cherries says the departments economic research service 
drought damage had less influence on the markets for other 
fruits tobacco sugar cane tree nuts and fresh vegetables 
last week the labor department reported that grocery prices rose 
14 percent in july the sharpest increase in 4 years one of the 
factors was a 47 percent gain for fresh fruits and vegetables 
usda economist glenn zepp said the biggest drought impact among 
fruit and vegetable crops was on processing vegetables grown in 
wisconsin minnesota michigan and illinois where production 
dropped and prices rose 
green pea production in wisconsin and minnesota which accounted 
for more than half of the us output in 1987 declined 50 percent 
this year because of droughtreduced yields 
snap bean production under contract with processors is expected 
to be down 14 percent from last year 
production in michigan minnesota and wisconsin is forecast 
down 20 percent zepp reports in the september issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine half the 1987 crop came from these 
three states a hot summer and limited moisture ravaged snap bean 
fields in arkansas pennsylvania and new york 
despite rain in late july in some production ares midwestern 
canners expect the sweet corn pack to be 30 percent to 50 percent 
below their planned volume similar shortfalls are reported for the 
regions canned beets carrots lima beans and tomatoes 
most processing tomatoes 88 percent in 1987 are grown in 
california so droughtreduced output in the midwest will have 
little effect on total tomato supplies or prices he said 
but zepp said that by midaugust canners were quoting delivered 
prices 25 percent to 35 percent higher for green peas snap beans 
and sweet corn than at the beginning of the summer 
looking at fresh vegetables he said shipments from major us 
production areas to consumer centers are slightly ahead of last 
year 
output from california the major producing state has not 
been affected by the drought because crops are irrigated he 
said fresh output from some drought areas is reportedly down 
because these areas normally provide only a small portion of total 
supplies however the effect on fresh vegetable prices has been 
minimal 
a large harvest of dry edible beans in 1987 drove prices down 
for most types and growers indicated in march they would reduce 
plantings 23 percent this year and turn to corn and soybeans as a 
result prices rose sharply in anticipation of the cutback 
but the dry bean acreage declined only 13 percent from last 
year and from a historical perspective the 1988 acreage was up by 
about 8 percent from the previous nineyear average 
in august the department estimated total dry bean production at 
21 million hundredweight down 20 percent from 1987 in michigan 
where farmers reduced bean acres by 43 percent production declined 
even more sharply 
dry bean production according to the august forecast is 
expected to be down 50 percent in michigan 32 percent in north 
dakota and 55 percent in minnesota while rising 14 percent in 
nebraska and 7 percent in colorado 
the lower yields were due to hot dry weather which damaged 
fields from new york to north dakota zepp said 
dry bean prices at the farm averaged 2730 per hundredweight in 
july compared with 1940 a year earlier 
although drought inflicted heavy damage on the tart cherry crop 
which is down 42 percent from last year it probably will have only 
minimal effect on other major fruit crops zepp said 
dry weather has been credited with reducing the size of 
peaches in alabama and north and south carolina dropping august 
estimates of southern state peach production 3 percent below june 
forecasts he said nevertheless total peach production is 
forecast 4 percent above last year 
the us apple harvest is expected to be down 23 percent from 
last years record production but still 2 percent more than in 
1986 
late spring freezes in michigan winter damage in parts of new 
york and tree stress from last years record crop in washington 
appear to be the principal culprits zepp said 
drought has hurt sugar beet production this year with the crop 
forecast at 257 million tons down from 279 million tons last 
season reduced yields per acre are to blame the report said 
particularly in the red river valley of minnesota and north dakota 
beet conditions in other growing areas were reported as good to 
excellent 
sugar cane production which is concentrated in florida hawaii 
louisiana and texas may increase 4 percent to 311 million tons in 
1988 since weather has been favorable and yields improved from 
last year 
fluecured tobacco production which is concentrated in the 
southeast is expected to be up 12 percent from last year despite 
hot dry weather early in the season burley output with kentucky 
being the leading state suffered from drought and crop estimates 
put the harvest down by 1 percent

comedian bill cosby has said no to a 
county request to make up for a 10000 budget cut by the 
administration of gov michael s dukakis in a program aimed at 
preventing teenage pregnancy 
franklin county commission chairman william benson said 
frustration and anger at state officials prompted commissioners to 
seek the donation from cosby who lives in shelburne falls 
its one thing to say that money is tight its another thing 
to have to approach a local celebrity hat in hand just to keep 
alive a program that was supposed to be a priority of the 
governor benson said thursday 
the 10000 grant for the program was among 40000 cut from 
county allocations in the states fiscal 1989 budget following 
projected revenue shortfalls 
in a letter to county commissioners this week an aide to cosby 
said the comedian would not cover the state aid cut

fiscally sensitive time palm springs voters will decide nov 8 
whether to continue a utility tax to avoid a deficit 
im just throwing it out there if the public doesnt want it 
and they say no you cant travel that way then so be it 
bono said

singersongwriter john denver says reports 
that he would pay the soviet union 10 million to take a ride on a 
soviet space ship are erroneous but he still would like to go 
let me be clear i would give my guitar to go into space 
denver said friday ive expressed this to nasa unfortunately 
it looks like a civilian in the american space program is now a 
long way off to fly with the soviets greatly enhances what i 
already considered an incredible opportunity 
he said the commercial arm of the soviet space program 
approached him about being the first american civilian to go up in 
a soviet spacecraft last april denver said he traveled to moscow 
to discuss the proposal with soviet officials and learned that it 
costs them roughly 10 million to house train and ultimately put a 
human in space for one week 
in the past when a noncivilian foreigner has gone up in a 
soviet spacecraft these costs have been assumed by means of a 
governmenttogovernment agreement since this venture is 
nongovernmental alternative means of financing will have to be 
explored regardless of what has been implied elsewhere i have no 
intention of paying the soviets 10 million and i think it would be 
highly inappropriate to do so

designer hats for horses 
that may be the next fashion trend on new york city streets 
says mayor edward i koch 
koch told the industrial designers society of america on friday 
that hes been looking into ways to comfort the citys carriage 
horses during hot muggy weather 
city regulations require that the animals be taken back to their 
stables when the mercury reaches 90 degrees but animal lovers say 
the horses can experience discomfort in temperatures just below 
that one horse collapsed earlier this month while being taken to 
his stable on a 90degreeplus day 
weve looked into the question of having umbrellas of 
different sorts to safeguard the horses and weve discarded that as 
unworkable koch told the designers weve come up with 
something that goes back to our roots i guess a straw hat for a 
horse 
he said there is no official design contest for such a hat but 
if anyone wants to send me a drawing i will select the best 
hat and then parks commissioner henry stern will issue 
regulations

a consultant linked to the pentagon 
procurement investigation says he never asked about the sources of 
sensitive information he received from other consultants and 
neither did the companies to which he passed it 
companies never ask you where you get the information 
thomas muldoon said in an interview published sunday in the 
hartford courant there was never any doubt what i was being paid 
for 
muldoon has been named in court papers in connection with a 
federal investigation into whether consultants obtained 
confidential or classified information about pentagon competitions 
and sold it to defense industry officials who wanted an edge in 
competing for multimilliondollar contracts 
muldoon who worked for hartfords united technologies corp and 
several other defense contractors described an informal and 
extensive network of consultants government officials and defense 
contractors whose interests in passing information often meshed 
he insisted that most consultants are aboveboard and do not 
intend to break the law in garnering their intelligence and he 
said he did not pay bribes 
muldoon has not been charged with any wrongdoing but he said he 
is fearful he might be 
im worried im going to prison he said and quite 
frankly i dont understand it 
in documents released by a federal court in dallas fbi agents 
allege that muldoon while working for united technologys norden 
systems division of norwalk was paying another consultant for 
information that was in turn being provided by a highranking navy 
official 
the information included rival bids on a contract for a 
battlefield communications system for which norden was competing 
the documents said 
muldoon characterized the governments investigation as an 
exercise in discovering the obvious 
this is like that great quote from the humphrey bogart movie 
casablanca when they close down the joint and the guy says im 
shocked theres gambling going on here muldoon said 
if theres that many companies involved and that many people 
you know its a fact of life

tracey ullman dubbed it the hippest emmys 
and oh was it next year theyll probably just call it so its 
the emmy awards see if we care 
but this was in fact the 40th annual emmy awards so it was 
kind of twofaced alternately glib and cynical then mushily 
nostalgic over clips of ozzie and harriet jimmy durante jack 
benny and rochester lucille ball and jackie gleason among dozens 
of others flickering reminders of the days when we werent so hip 
this years executive producer lorne michaels of saturday 
night live gamely attempted to salvage the event from tedium and 
for the most part succeeded it was 40 minutes shorter and 
infinitely more entertaining than the rambling four hours last year 
instead of the embarrassingly bad musical number that has opened 
awards shows past sunday nights show opened with a musical number 
that was bad on purpose jan hooks and nora dunn doing their 
wonderfully lame lounge act the sweeney sisters from saturday 
night live during a bad medley of tv theme songs they roamed 
the audience gaping at the celebrities who squirmed and simpered 
uncomfortably 
michaels thinly veiled homage to his own show the band was 
of course led by snls ge smith occasionally rivaled even the 
fox broadcasting cos level of selfpromotion this is the second 
year fox has carried the emmys 
in between plugging their fox shows copresenters ullman and 
garry shandling discussed the emmys 
this is the hippest emmys ive ever seen ullman said 
oh these are the real emmys i thought this was just another 
saturday night live skit replied shandling displaying hipness 
squared 
some winners even got in on the toohip act john larroquette 
who picked up his fourth emmy for best supporting actor in night 
court noted wearily now i am officially overwhelmed he 
thanked the academy for its generosity and keen eye for talent 
a little antihumility joke he overexplained 
michaels dispensed with the cohost concept instead having 
copresenters engage in dialogues that were sometimes gasp 
funny kirstie alley cheers enthused over copresenter john 
lithgows acting ability especially his broadway performance in 
m butterfly lithgow replied in perfect halting perplexity 
this is very embarrassing kirstie but im not exactly sure 
what you do 
robin williams not even safe on videotape paid a hilarious 
crazed tasteless tribute to cable programming cable shows were 
eligible for emmys this year for the first time 
tony danza was the designated acceptor a new comic device 
that allowed him to pick up emmys for those who were too hip to 
even be at the ceremony when john shea won for supporting actor in 
baby m danza rushed up to accept the statuette gushing i 
didnt prepare anything i didnt think he was going to win 
later after his third or fourth time danza noted intelligently 
this was funny the first couple of times but im outta 
material 
there were moments immune from sneering larry drake received a 
warm ovation when he was named best supporting actor in a drama for 
his sensitive portrayal of the retarded office assistant on la 
law 
there was an ovation for copresenters mary tyler moore and dick 
van dyke who played rob and laura petrie on the dick van dyke 
show in the 1960s van dyke nudged moore into spouting in her 
trademark quaver oh rob 
richard kiley who won best lead actor in a drama brought the 
proceedings back to reality when he complained about nbc having in 
fact canceled his critically praised show a year in the life 
michaels brought out some unexpected copresenters such as 
head of the class star robyn givens and her heavyweight hubby 
mike tyson and newsies sam donaldson and george f will 
hip magicians penn and teller presented the wrapup of the 44 
technical awards given out saturday 
in perhaps a metaphor for the night penn jillette promised to

a racial confrontation between whites 
wielding baseball bats and rock and bottlethrowing blacks 
culminated sunday in the explosion of a grenade which injured 
seven people authorities said 
four of the injured were juveniles including a 12yearold 
none of the injuries appeared critical but one 17yearold boy was 
admitted to manatee memorial hospital for treatment authorities 
said 
the manatee county sheriffs office still trying to piece 
together information late sunday could not confirm a report that 
there was shooting with an automatic weapon 
manatee county sheriff charlie wells said authorities believe 
they know who threw the grenade but no arrests had been made by 
late sunday after the incident in the parking lot of a convenience 
store 
the sheriffs office said all of the injured were black except 
for one 28yearold man 
the incident broke out about 645 pm between a group of blacks 
standing in the parking lot and a group of whites who had gathered 
at an adjacent bar wells said 
it does not appear to be a strictly racial incident even 
though the situation basically is between whites and blacks 
wells told the bradenton herald it does not appear to be 
anything thats brewing over a period of time from what we can find 
out 
however several residents told the newspaper that racial 
tensions have run high in the racially mixed neighborhood called 
duplex city since the opening of the bar

the international committee of the red cross was 
pressured by its vice president and the swiss government during 
world war ii into keeping silent on the massacre of jews by the 
nazis a swiss historian says 
the charge comes from professor jeanclaude favez who was 
invited by the genevabased red cross to examine its wartime 
records and settle the holocaust controversy that still shadows the 
125yearold organization 
red cross directorgeneral jacques moreillon who played a key 
role in opening the files to favez six years ago says the 
historians verdict stems from hindsight and that a public appeal 
by the red cross over the massacres of european jews would have 
jeopardized its humanitarian work in nazi germany 
about 6 million jews were killed by the nazis during the 
holocaust 
favez and moreillon spoke in a tv documentary broadcast sunday 
by the british broadcasting corp in its everyman series which 
examines moral quandaries like the one the red cross faced over the 
holocaust 
the red cross has always observed a code of silence and 
neutrality before such atrocities believing that this alone wins 
it the trust of governments and access to jails and prisonerofwar 
camps from which partisan organizations would be banned 
favez argued however that enough information about the 
genocide of the jews had filtered out of germany by the summer of 
1942 to persuade red cross officers that they should break with 
tradition and issue a public protest 
the records show that the draft of a protest circulated among 
the 23 members of the international committee of the red cross and 
that at a special meeting on oct 14 1942 21 of the 23 members 
favored publishing it the bbc said 
but the majority vote was overruled by carljacob burckhardt 
then the organizations vice president and its dominant figure and 
by philippe etter president of switzerland and a red cross 
committee member the documentary said citing the documents 
uncovered by favez 
the swiss government was desperately worried that switzerland 
would be invaded by the nazis and it was determined to muzzle any 
red cross protest that might provoke them the bbc said 
moreillon the directorgeneral said that before he read 
favezs report my gut feeling was that the committee should have 
spoken out after reading it strangely enough i came to the 
conclusion that at that time perhaps it would have been different 
later but at that time in october 1942 it was probably the 
wisest course 
he said the information about the holocaust then was extremely 
flimsy the facts were not really known it was an impression 
moreillon added we would have run a considerable risk by 
protesting we would have looked perhaps better but the prisoners 
would not 
favez said the red cross feared the nazis would retaliate by 
withdrawing from the geneva conventions of that time which allowed 
the red cross to visit prisoners of war on both sides give them 
letters and food parcels and lobby for better prison conditions 
in addition the conventions in 1942 did not yet cover 
civilians thus the germans could have claimed the jews were not 
the business of the red cross the bbc said 
nonetheless according to red cross documents shown in the 
documentary those agreements did not prevent burckhardt from 
appealing directly to ss commander heinrich himmler on behalf of a 
personal friend in a concentration camp 
theres no evidence that burckhardt used his influence on 
behalf of the jews the bbc said 
favez doubted the germans would have renounced the conventions 
saying there were german prisoners of war in allied hands any 
unilateral action against the conventions by the reich would have 
left these prisoners defenseless so i think the red cross 
exaggerated the risk 
he also disagreed that the red cross lacked sufficient evidence 
of genocide in 1942 
the nazis had decided that spring on liquidating the jews and 
favez said eyewitness accounts and reports sent back by red cross 
delegates in berlin were already persuasive 
it was fragmentary information but it clearly suggested the 
nazis were massacring jews on a large scale he said 
moreillon replied it is only now with the pictures we have 
seen after the concentration camps that we put these things 
together in 1942 i genuinely believe that people could not 
imagine the unimaginable

donald trump has one in the back seat of his 
limo most senators keep one and political candidates are hooked 
on them 
some brewing scandal no just the ubiquitous telephone 
facsimile machine or fax the breadboxsized gizmos that make 
sending a letter as easy as dialing the phone 
its probably the most important piece of office equipment 
that we have says gordon hensley press aide to republican 
senate candidate peter dawkins of new jersey 
jim abbott spokesman for dawkins democratic opponent sen 
frank lautenberg adds when our computer goes down were 
inconvenienced but when our fax machine isnt working were in 
deep doodoo 
the machines now relied upon by virtually all large campaigns 
and major news organizations as well as bigtime businessmen like 
trump have become the electronic mailman for politics and 
government 
at the associated press newsroom in washington wouldbe 
newsmakers have to line up to get through on the everbusy machine 
george bushs daily schedule might come in first followed by a 
weather map then some congressmans announcement of drought relief 
for his district 
the almostinstant transmissions have rendered obsolete the 
fulltime motorcycle couriers once dispatched to pick up film and 
press releases 
even the capitals omnipresent army of bicycleriding couriers 
has seen its workload fall to inhuman competition 
facsimile machines as the names implies send replicas of 
letters and other documents over telephone lines they transmit at 
speeds as fast as 12 seconds a page with quality nearly as good as 
the original 
the machines use digital scanners to read pages and talk to 
each other via internal modems the same devices that connect 
computers 
in the past two years sales of the machines have skyrocketed 
the gadgets have meanwhile come down in size and price 
the japanesebased sharp electronics corp the leader in us 
facsimile machine sales says the overall fax market grew by 220 
percent in 1987 sharp with american headquarters in mahwah nj 
sold 12000 machines in both november and december 
though fax addicts are relatively new few can or want to 
recall what they did without the handy machines 
mark brown a spokesman for rep william hughes dnj recalls 
only too well what he did with the congressmans press releases he 
called newspaper after newspaper and dictated 
i would spend hours and hours on the phone reading the same 
thing over and over brown said i would get crazy 
there is a down side to the high technology brown says at 
least with his dictation he knew he was talking to a person 
brown says he must make followup calls to make sure the 
material hes sent hasnt wound up in electronic nevernever land 
or more likely buried under the rest of a fax machines 
relentless output 
i dont have any guarantee that it gets to them he said

the air force is so short of spare parts for 
the b1 bomber that mechanics have to take parts off grounded 
planes to permit others to continue training flights congressional 
investigators say 
but the air force disputes conclusions by the congressional 
general accounting office that it still has not been able to meet 
training and readiness objectives for the b1 
reliability shortfalls parts failing faster than expected 
continue to be a major cause of spare parts shortages gao said 
in a study released by rep les aspin dwis chairman of the 
armed services committee and a chief congressional critic of the 
7yearold bomber 
aspin and other critics say the b1 isnt working as well as the 
air force said it would the air force says the plane is performing 
as expected and says most problems thus far have been common bugs 
experienced by all new weapons systems 
president reagan resurrected the b1 in 1981 four years after 
it was killed by president carter and ordered the air force to buy 
100 of the planes for use in the nations arsenal of longrange 
weapons 
the gao report was released saturday by aspin a week after 
another congressional budget office study also made public by aspin 
said improvements to the b1 could cost up to 34 billion 
capt jay defrank a spokesman for the service maintained that 
the air force is making steady progress in assuring adequate 
spare parts are available 
the most important point is that the b1b is performing its 
deterrent mission right now said defrank today b1b aircraft 
have trained crews and fly the necessary sorties to meet wartime 
requirements 
the air force has steadily improved the planned rate of b1b 
training flights and expects that trend to continue as the system 
matures and spare parts are delivered 
the gao did say the air force is doing a better job than in 1987 
the air forces and contractors attention to priority parts 
has resolved some parts problems but a more systematic approach 
would ensure early and appropriate attention to the problem 
parts the study said 
if there were shortages of spare parts affecting training 
flights those shortages could also affect the number of planes 
available during wartime aspin noted 
alert status is the bombers reason for being if thats 
adversely affected and it is here then youve got problems 
he said 
the last b1 was delivered april 30 the air force says the 
entire program will cost 273 billion excluding improvements 
the b1 will be used in conjunction with the socalled 
stealth b2 bomber to replace aging b52s as the countrys 
fleet of longrange nuclear bombers

in 1990 the final season of his threeyear contract sharply 
criticized steinbrenner a week ago although he did not name the 
owner

opposing views on freedom of expression and 
religion clashed at the venice film festival over attempts to stop 
the showing of martin scorseses the last temptation of christ 
the movie considered sacrilegious or blasphemous by some is 
one of 60 films to be featured at the festival that started today 
and runs through sept 9 and is not among the 22 competing for the 
golden lion award 
italys dominant christian democrat party and some roman 
catholic leaders and groups have condemned scorseses film as 
blasphemous because of a scene that depicts jesus on the cross 
hallucinating about abandoning his role as a redeemer making love 
to mary magdalene and raising a family with her 
venices prosecutor has asked a judge to ban the film in venice 
under italys laws on obscenity and blasphemy the judge has not 
made a decision 
its amazing that still today after many battles for civil 
rights the right of the film festival to feature movies chosen for 
their artistic value can be questioned said paolo portoghesi 
president of the venice biennale which organizes the festival 
festival director guglielmo biraghi said sunday he is in favor 
of the controversy and therefore welcomes it because it nourishes 
the 56yearold film festival the worlds oldest 
among the us films competing for the golden lion are david 
mamets things change ivan passers haunted summer and 
alan ruolphs the moderns 
italian director franco zeffirellis young toscanini will 
have its premier at the festival although he once threatened to 
withdraw it if the last temptation of christ was not 
rescheduled

if youre against both george bush and michael 
dukakis dont despair there are 314 others to choose from so far 
this year including two teenage boys and two men who say they are 
in jail 
a recent letter to 15yearold candidate ary dov rosenbaum of 
new york prompted the following explanation 
i am running as a protest against the other candidates i 
didnt take any trips with donna rice i just feel with these 
kind of people running our nation we are headed for disaster 
donna rice is the model who went on a boat trip with former 
candidate gary hart 
robert bryant haynes 16 of hertford nc confided that he has 
a 14yearold running mate wants a 50 percent cut in taxes is 
against abortion and would work for the colonization of mars 
none of the 314 got any votes at the major party conventions 
but 56 of them have told the federal election commission that they 
have collected or spent at least 5000 on their campaigns 
candidates have not done well in recent years unless they were 
nominated by the democrats or republicans john anderson a former 
republican congressman ran as an independent in 1980 and won 
5720060 votes 66 percent of the total but has hardly been 
heard of since then 
a possible no 3 in the results this year is ron paul another 
republican excongressman his libertarian party ran third in 1984 
but got only 228314 votes to 54455075 for president reagan and 
37577185 for former vice president walter mondale 
the libertarians generally call for as little government as 
possible less interference in private lives at home and less us 
activism overseas 
there is nothing in the constitution to justify the choosing 
of one thug regime over another in a foreign war paul said we 
should not have tangling foreign alliances we should have a strong 
military but only in the united states 
his phrase echoed thomas jeffersons at his first inaugural in 
1801 honest friendship with all nations entangling alliances 
with none 
libertarian planks this year also include repeal of laws against 
victimless crimes and an end to taxation of land 
like many other countries this one has both a liberal and a 
conservative party but they operate largely in new york and have 
little to do with national politics 
willa kenoyer of shelby mich has been nominated by the 
socialist party and is trying to get on the ballot in 20 of the 50 
states 
if our vote runs into five figures well be happy said anne 
rosenhaft the partys executive secretary we expect to do 
better in the 21st century 
in 1920 eugene debs in jail for opposition to world war i ran 
on the socialist ticket and received 915490 votes 
getting on the ballot is tedious as well as expensive for minor 
candidates it usually requires the collection of thousands of 
signatures in each state voters may write in the names of any of 
the 514 or anyone else who strikes their fancy but that can be 
difficult when voting is by machine few do it 
the communist party is not running a candidate for the 
presidency this year 
its enormously difficult and just too expensive said louis 
diskin of the partys education department 
gus hall its perennial leader got 36386 votes in 1984 diskin 
said hall is continuing to make speeches working through labor 
unions and other organizations in which the party has members 
diskin and rosenhaft spoke by telephone from their party 
headquarters in new york 
the prohibition party claims to be one of the oldest dating 
back to 1869 it opposes not only alcohol but communism and all 
other totalitarian ideologies national prohibition of alcoholic 
beverages was authorized by an amendment to the constitution in 
1920 but repealed in 1933 
in 1984 the prohibition candidate earl dodge got only 4242 
votes but he is trying again this time 
glenn day has compiled a book called minor presidential 
candidates and parties of 1988 by writing letters to more that 
200 people from the federal election commissions list he got 
about 60 replies 
day quotes one of his correspondents as writing in august of 
last year that he is a prisoner now confined another is 
reported as claiming 
i am the only person to start his campaign three different 
times from inside a prison 
young rosenbaum and haynes also have some time to wait the 
constitution requires that a president be 35 years old 
frederick s eiland the election commissions press officer 
said anyone can fill out the forms and declare himself or herself a 
candidate he now has 316 names on this years list including bush 
and dukakis

us food prices could go even higher unless 
the agriculture department stops subsidizing wheat sales to foreign 
countries three consumer groups say 
representatives of the consumers union community nutrition 
institute and the consumer federation of america in a letter 
released sunday urged usda to suspend its export enhancement 
program 
the three groups said continuing wheat export subsidies under 
the program may further jeopardize the supply of this essential 
food grain and push food prices even higher 
drought has reduced us crop production sharply this year 
including wheat and has eaten deeply into reserve stockpiles 
although grain prices have risen sharply as supplies have 
fallen agriculture department officials have said repeatedly that 
there are ample stocks to meet domestic and foreign demands until 
new harvests are ready next year 
but the consumer groups said that if wheat export subsidies 
continue at their recent pace it could result in a rise in food 
prices greater than now expected in 1989 because of this years 
drought 
at the very least usda should suspend general use of the 
export enhancement program for wheat and other food and feed 
commodities in the year ahead the letter said next year is a 
period of great uncertainty 
the consumer interests cited an aug 17 subsidy of between 93 
and 103 a ton for a 198000ton shipment of flour to egypt a 
total subsidy of about 20 million 
it is hard to justify any subsidy on grain but there is no 
economic justification for subsidizing us milling companies 
whatsoever they said 
under the export enhancement program or eep private companies 
are given free surplus commodities owned by the government to 
compensate them for selling designated products wheat and other 
items to selected foreign countries at reduced prices 
the idea behind the program which was authorized by congress in 
the 1985 farm law is to sell commodities at prices that meet those 
of competitors notably the european economic community which also 
uses subsidies to cut export prices 
since june 4 1985 eep has been used in more than 100 
initiatives or arrangements with dozens of countries to sell 
nearly 67 million metric tons of us farm products including 442 
million tons of wheat 25 million tons of flour 596 million tons 
of barley lesser amounts of sorghum rice poultry feed vegetable 
oil frozen poultry and live dairy cattle and 3857 million eggs 
in all the total sales value of those items as of aug 18 was 
about 55 billion the estimated value of the eep bonuses or 
subsidies totaled 299 billion according to the agriculture 
departments foreign agricultural service 
earlier this month china was given approval for a new line of 
eep subsidy to buy an additional 2 million tons of us wheat 
under various authorizations since jan 26 1987 china already had 
bought about 7 million tons of wheat under the subsidy program 
the soviet union also has been a big user of the subsidy 
program buying about 13 million tons of wheat since april 30 1987

the widow of the rev martin luther king jr 
says his famous i have a dream speech 25 years ago helped end 
official segregation in the united states but that the cancer of 
racism still must be fought 
coretta scott king widow of the slain civil rights leader 
helped lead thousands of marchers over the weekend as they retraced 
the steps of the 1963 march on washington that was highlighted by 
kings oration 
singing we shall overcome mrs king was joined by 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis and black leader 
jesse jackson at the head of the procession 
at the washington monument dukakis urged the marchers to 
continue the struggle for justice for all americans 
we have to march not just so that some of us can reach the top 
of the hill dukakis said we must march until every american 
has reached the bright sunshine of opportunity until we can stand 
and stand together in the golden glow of our shared dream 
republican presidential nominee george bush and his running 
mate dan quayle did not respond to invitations to attend the 
rally organizers said 
mrs king said the 1963 march helped break the spine of racial 
segregation in the united states and that today we still have 
a dream of a nation free of the cancer of racism 
us park police estimated the crowd at 55000 people fewer 
than the 250000 who thronged the national mall for kings famous 
oration climaxing the march on washington on aug 28 1963 a crowd 
that was equalled five years ago at a 20th anniversary march 
jackson appearing sunday on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley said the most immediate task now for organizers is a 
massive voter registration drive to bring more blacks women 
and lowincome americans into the electorate 
jackson said that under the reagan administration there has 
been less of a commitment to affirmative action less of a 
commitment to civil rights 
jackson had received the biggest cheers during saturdays march 
and speeches when he delivered a scathing attack on bush 
george bush is not in washington today jackson said he 
must not be here for the inauguration next january 
today reagan and bush attempt to return us to an old 
fortress he said they are trying to rebuild old walls they 
have fought to crush the dream 
president reagan in california issued a statement asserting 
that since king led the landmark march on washington in 1963 
america has made vast progress toward fully achieving dr kings 
dream of a colorblind society

crook countys top official credits the 
fumes of the juniper berries and the sagebrush but for 
whatever reason voters here have picked presidential winners in 
every election since 1882 except one 
the county became the nations last of the bellwether counties 
four years ago when palo alto county iowa voted for walter 
mondale 
the one flaw in crook countys record came when voters in 1888 
reflected the popular vote and backed grover cleveland but the 
majority of the nations electoral votes put benjamin harrison in 
the white house 
you can call it coincidence or something permeating the air 
said dick hoppes chairman of the county commissioners and judge of 
juvenile court 
perhaps something transpires from the fumes of the juniper 
berries and the sagebrush that affects peoples mentality he 
said with a grin if i really knew i could probably use the same 
theories and make a fortune in the stock market 
but tim hibbits a political pollster from portland says its 
just statistical chance 
when youve got thousands and thousands of counties in the 
united states its just likely that some of them are going to pick 
the results every time out saidhibbitts president of th 
research inc 
he notes that the countys nearperfect voting record holds only 
for the presidential elections it backed the loser in the last 
gubernatorial race 
its like a sports streak hibbits said sooner or later 
it will be broken its interesting to see how long it can go 
as for predicting how crook county will go local political 
observers arent ready to commit 
crook county is the one with the accurate voting record not 
me said jym smith publisher of the central oregonian and a 
transplanted texan who characterizes the county as staunchly 
conservative even though registered democrats outnumber 
republicans 3326 to 2504 
they do not look outside the community either for help or 
interference smith said weve got a lot of people who moved 
here in the dust bowl days a lot of people are descended from 
homesteaders a lot of people moved in and followed the jobs when 
the timber industry started to grow 
laselle coles retired manager of the local irrigation district 
says its not unusual to find a lifelong democrat like himself 
running the local campaign for a republican like george bush 
ive always voted for the person i thought would be best for 
the job he said 
hoppes said residents give about as much thought to the countys 
unique bellwether status as they would to pictures of somebody 
elses grandchildren 
they would show interest for a moment because its the 
courteous thing to do but frankly they dont give a damn he 
said 
in 1952 however pollsters took great note of the central 
oregon county located about 150 miles from portland and descended 
on the area since then crook county periodically has been sampled 
come election day this november those looking to crook county 
for a hint of the election results will have a long wait crook 
county counts its ballots by hand and the county clerk says a 
final tally wont be available until early wednesday 
named for indian fighter maj gen george crook the county is 
2991 square miles of mountains sagebrush and rimrock east of the 
cascade range 
the only incorporated city is prineville which has 5410 of the 
countys 13000 inhabitants

details of michael dukakis military career will 
probably never be known because a fire that ravaged a government 
warehouse in st louis 15 years ago destroyed millions of files 
records that do exist however indicate that the democratic 
presidential candidate spent an uneventful two years in the service 
of his country as an enlisted man in postwar korea 
the issue of military service has received unusual prominence 
this political season since the disclosure that republican vice 
presidential nominee sen dan quayle secured a spot in the indiana 
national guard during the 1960s rather than face duty in vietnam 
dukakis rival vice president bush and his running mate texas 
sen lloyd bentsen both served with distinction as pilots in world 
war ii 
by accident of birth dukakis belonged to the korea generation 
sandwiched between world war ii in the 1940s and the vietnam war in 
the 1960s 
governor dukakis records were destroyed in a fire that went 
through the national personnel records center back in 1973 a 
significant number of records were destroyed in that fire said 
lt col greg rixon an army spokesman in washington 
aides to the governor promised to ask him to search his home for 
any documents he may have in his possession no new papers were 
forthcoming by late friday 
dukakis graduated at age 17 from brookline high school in 
suburban boston in the spring of 1951 the year that ultimately 
proved to be the bloodiest of the korean war 
that september dukakis enrolled at swarthmore college outside 
philadelphia when he turned 18 in november he registered for the 
military draft but as a college student he applied for and 
received a student deferment from the military draft he was 
classified 2s 
the deferment was routinely renewed during his sophomore and 
junior years as dukakis met the requirements by remaining a student 
in good standing in the meantime an armistice signed on july 27 
1953 ended the fighting in korea 
in 1955 during dukakiss senior year he applied to harvard law 
school and got accepted but he chose not to apply for a graduate 
deferment telling his family that he wanted to get his military 
service behind him so that when he finished law school he could 
plunge directly into his career 
dukakis volunteered and promptly went on active duty in the 
regular army on july 19 1955 after basic training at fort dix 
nj dukakis went to camp gordon ga for training as a radio 
operator 
later he was assigned to munsan south korea just south of the 
demilitarized zone in a unit supporting the military armistice 
commission attempting to maintain the united nations ceasefire 
jay levine a classmate of dukakis who served with him in 
korea is quoted in a biography of dukakis as saying he didnt 
like the army at all he was too bright and smart for it and he 
was subject to an immense amount of spit and polish 
according to family members dukakis was cold and bored and 
tried to pass the time by studying the korean language 
after 21 months of service dukakis was terminated from active 
duty on april 25 1957 with the rank of specialist three he 
received a good conduct medal and an honorable discharge his 
classification was changed to 4a indicating veteran and he was 
transferred into the individual ready reserve in the massachusetts 
district 
at the time the individual ready reserve was essentially a 
roster of recent veterans kept by the government as a pool of 
trained personnel who could be called up quickly in case of 
emergency according to military spokesmen such reserve status was 
a routine formality in the late 1950s and did not entail any 
specific duties 
i have no records to reflect what governor dukakis did as a 
member of the irr said major arthur house a public affairs 
officer at the army reserve personnel center in st louis 
house said the st louis facility is the nations central 
repository of military records thus the 1973 fire wiped out 
much information that was kept only there

three coins in the fountain may mean 
romance but its going to take thousands of them to fix it 
residents on sunday lined quarters end to end over 13 blocks to 
help raise money to pay a 20000 repair bill for this rural 
communitys beloved 50yearold fountain 
more than 18700 was raised according to a preliminary count 
i think we are going to be close city council member eva 
knight said 
ms knight 44 said she and some bank tellers came up with the 
idea when it became clear the city budget couldnt afford the 
expense 
i had heard that back in the 1930s when money was very tight 
that the alliance high school band earned money for a trip by 
putting a row of dimes down a block she said 
i told our tellers that a quarter today probably isnt worth 
what a dime was then but we still could raise some money 
a lot of people remember the fountain from when they were 
growing up they wanted to fix it coins and fountains are always 
kind of linked in our case we put the two together ms knight 
said

robert duck must know something special 
about ducks 
on sunday for the seventh time in eight years his entry into 
the great american duck race took first place 
this time it was with a bird named pride of the 62nd army band 
who marched through a field of webfooted sprinters to capture the 
championship at the ninth annual race 
ducks stable of 28 entries dominated the weekend festivities 
taking six of eight places in the finals and sweeping the top three 
positions 
pride was clocked at a blistering 108 second on the 16foot 
runway 
finishing a fast second was nobill prize followed by kiwanis 
quacker 
despite pocketing 5450 for the twoday event duck said the 
race wasnt easy 
this was truly a tough year for my ducks in the race he 
said the competition was as tough as it has ever been with some 
serious duck trainers taking part 
the duck family got in the act too with ducks children taking 
home 150 for victories in the youth division 
last years champion for duck oliver south apparently couldnt 
take the prerace publicity and pressure and failed to make the 
championship round oliver south is ducks fastest fowl and has 
been clocked at 085 second 
some of ducks stable includes heres george and michael 
duquackis 
duck said prides name is a tribute to an army band duck played 
with while in the service

it took him 15 years but 70yearold tom 
stear finally has his coveted title winner of the international 
clamshell pitching club tournament 
he was the strong sentimental favorite said the cape may 
clubs president richard reinhart 
stear rallied in the bestoffive finals from a 21 game deficit 
and a 147 score in the fourth game to defeat harry mazuk the 1986 
champion who was in the finals for the third consecutive year 
the competition is played like horseshoes reinhart said with 
points for tossing the approximately 4inch diameter shells in or 
near 4inch holes cut into the sand two points are tallied each 
time a player throws the shell into the hole and one point for the 
player closest to the hole 
the holes are set at 25 feet 
participants must continue to throw broken shells until they are 
less than twothirds their initial size reinhart said 
about 100 people watched stear win the title in a 78man field 
reinhart called the victory a tribute to the champions ability to 
block out occasional rain sprinkles and strong winds 
when its windy like that all bets are off reinhart said 
in the womens division delores houston of levittown pa 
triumphed in a 22woman field for her third championship she 
defeated dolly jacobsen of media pa

two soviets and the first afghan in space blasted 
off from a central asian space center early monday to join 
cosmonauts seeking an endurance record aboard the soviet unions 
orbiting space station mir 
a proton rocket carrying pilot vladimir lyakhov doctor valery 
polyakov and afghan military pilot abdul ahmad mohmand aboard a 
soyuz tm6 capsule lifted off from the baikonur space center at 
823 am moscow time 1223 am edt 
soviet television provided a live broadcast of the white rocket 
riding a long orange flame into the clear sky and cut away as the 
rocket disappeared liftoff was as scheduled 
while the soviet cosmonaut and afghan crew member will return to 
earth after eight days polyakov will remain aboard mir to monitor 
the health of its longtime residents vladimir titov and musa 
manarov officials said 
on dec 21 titov 40 and manarov 37 will have been in space 
one year breaking the previous endurance record set by yuri 
romanenko romanenko returned to earth from a 326day flight on 
dec 29 
soviet space officials have said mir will be permanently manned 
and replacements for titov and manarov are to be sent aloft in a 
joint sovietfrench space flight later this year said maj gen 
vladimir dzhamidekov deputy director of cosmonaut training at 
baikonur 
his boss vladimir shatalov said titov and manarov will return 
to earth in late december but did not give an exact date or say 
whether polyakov will accompany them 
soviet space officials have said the long flights are designed 
to test whether people can withstand weightlessness and the other 
conditions for a possible manned mission to mars a journey that 
would take three years 
with an afghan spaceman on board this weeks flight has as much 
political as scientific significance 
the flight was originally scheduled for the middle of next year 
but was moved up to monday apparently so it would fall near the 
halfway point in the soviet withdrawal of troops from afghanistan 
radio moscow reported sunday that mohmand a 29yearold veteran 
military pilot was chosen from two candidates training to be the 
first afghan in space 
radio moscow said the soyuz tm6 will dock with the soviet 
unions orbiting space station mir peace on wednesday 
mohmand himself was part of the joint sovietafghan effort to 
put down an insurgency in his homeland he said in an interview 
published sunday in the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya that he had 
flown 500 attack flights against insurgents 
the soviet union began pulling out its more than 100000 troops 
from afghanistan on may 15 and reached the halfway mark aug 15 
during the pullout the kremlin has flooded the official media 
with reports emphasizing that economic scientific and cultural 
contacts will increase as sovietafghan military links are scaled 
back 
afghanistan highlighted the political significance of the joint 
mission by sending an official delegation headed by mohammad aslam 
watanjar afghanistans communications minister and member of its 
ruling politburo to baikonur 
science also figures prominently in the mission mohmand told 
sovietskaya rossiya the cosmonauts will use instruments aboard mir 
to search for potential mining areas in his homeland and to measure 
oil and gas deposits 
to help alleviate a water shortage in afghanistan the 
cosmonauts also will be looking at snow and glaciers in mountains 
and will assess the hydroelectric potential of afghanistans 
rivers mohmand said 
the spacemen also will try to locate regions in afghanistan 
where earthquakes might occur 
the 46yearold polyakov making his first space flight is to 
supervise experiments on the effects of space travel on the body 
the afghansoviet mission is the second of three missions 
scheduled this year in the soviet manned space program it comes 
after the us manned program was grounded after the january 1986 
explosion of the shuttle challenger the shuttle discovery is 
expected to be launched in late september or early october 
a bulgarian cosmonaut and two soviet colleagues returned to 
earth june 17 after a 10day flight that included a linking with 
mir a sovietfrench crew is to blast off nov 21 for a monthlong 
mission

changing political and strategic factors may 
be opening the way for limited nuclear arms nonproliferation pacts 
with india pakistan and even china according to a senate study 
published sunday 
the report by the senate foreign relations committee staff 
concludes that despite their advanced atomic energy programs 
neither india nor pakistan has chosen to undertake an overt nuclear 
weapons project 
the report concludes that india could produce a dozen to 18 
nuclear weapons a year and that pakistan is capable of 
manufacturing only one to three such weapons annually 
but the report prepared by peter w galbraith a south asia 
expert on the committee staff says both pakistan and india see 
strategic disadvantages in the general spread of nuclear weapons in 
south asia 
it says this provides an incentive for each to take steps to 
keep the region free of nuclear weapons 
and it says that with negotiation a nuclear weapons free zone 
that included parts of china and the indian ocean as well as south 
asia might be achievable

a private study says modern technology that is 
making it easier for businesses to move quickly may also spell the 
twilight years for the growth of government taxing and 
regulatory power 
richard b mckenzie an economics professor at clemson 
university in south carolina said computers facsimile machines 
satellites and other technologies have enabled businesses to 
respond to government intrusion by going elsewhere 
mckenzie conducted his study for the washingtonbased cato 
institute a research organization which generally follows a 
libertarian philosophy of encouraging the least possible government 
intervention in human affairs 
capital is being freed from the strict confines of arbitrary 
national boundaries he wrote as a consequence the power of 
government to tax and regulate may be in its twilight years

the kansas city times said in an 
editorial that sen dan quayle should be dropped as the republican 
vice presidential nominee 
each day seems to bring new questions about the junior senator 
from indiana some of them concerning his past and others the 
result of his vacuous performances in the last two weeks the 
newspaper said saturday if he is serious about the white house 
george bush will get quayle off the ticket 
the times cited the question of quayles service in the national 
guard during the vietnam war but also said that controversy had 
obscured other questions about quayle and his suitability for the 
vice presidency 
the paper said quayle had raised doubts about his knowledge of 
the nations farm policy when he appeared thursday at the missouri 
state fair in sedalia 
at that appearance quayle could not define agricultural target 
prices when a reporter asked him he referred two other farm policy 
questions to sen christopher bond rmo who was appearing with 
him

republican sen nancy kassebaum says the 
flap over dan quayles service in the national guard might hurt the 
republican vice presidential nominees effectiveness as a spokesman 
on national defense 
i think michael dukakis was vulnerable on that issue 
kassebaum of kansas said saturday i felt quayles strength was 
defense this may have diminished that 
in a speech to the kansas independent bankers association 
kassebaum said she is disturbed about the tone of the presidential 
campaign so far including tactics being used by vice president 
george bush 
kassebaum said bush should spend more time talking about the 
economy and less time criticizing dukakis for his veto of a bill 
requiring teachers to lead schoolchildren in the pledge of 
allegiance 
it used to be that the political campaigns didnt even start 
until after labor day and i think we were better off then 
kassebaum said it disturbs me to see the political camps 
spending their time talking about such things as burning flags or 
the pledge of allegiance

an american indian tribal leader says a 
162 million landclaims settlement one of the largest this 
century will offer prosperity for the tribes members who stand 
to receive 20000 each 
after four years of negotiations the puyallup indian tribe 
voted overwhelmingly to accept the settlement and drop a legal 
challenge for the onetime reservation land that included parts of 
downtown tacoma 
the settlement calls for the federal government to pay 775 
million the rest would be paid by washington state tacoma the 
port and private industry it must still be approved by congress 
and president reagan 
the tribal membership has voted to express their belief that 
our childrens future can best be secured through the settlement 
process rather than through the uncertainty of a lengthy court 
battle bill sterud chairman of the tribal council said after 
saturdays 319162 vote 
its been a long long battle for our people to finally get 
the opportunity to have a future of prosperity 
the settlement also calls for a fouryear jobtraining program 
to serve 265 people a 22 million permanent trust fund for 
socialservice projects a 10 million fishenhancement program 
95 million for the tribe to buy land and pursue economic 
opportunities plus land around the blair waterway on which to 
build its own port 
at issue was ownership within the boundaries of the old 
reservation which included parts of downtown and the tacoma 
tideflats now home of the booming port of tacoma the nations 
16th largest port 
treaties from the 1850s gave the puyallups a reservation of 
about 18000 acres but holdings dwindled as land allotted to 
individual members was sold in what tribal historians say often 
were shady or fraudulent deals 
two decades ago about all that was left was a 35acre cemetery 
but activists fought the state and local governments over treaty 
rights and land claims and vigorous enrollment efforts boosted the 
tribes membership from a low of 400 to about 1500 today 
in 1984 the us supreme court upheld a ruling giving the tribe 
title to 12 acres of former puyallup river bed that opened the 
question of whether the tribe could claim to more land 
in february 1986 the tribe voted 118102 to reject a 140 
million settlement if the tribe rejected the latest proposal it 
would have gone to court to claim the land 
im very very elated said rep norm dicks dwash who 
played a key role in the negotiations i think its a victory for 
the tribe and a victory for the community its been a lot of 
work 
its fantastic said john mccarthy a port commissioner and 
another negotiator were very pleased with the results 
dicks said he and sen daniel inouye dhawaii chairman of the 
select committee on indian affairs will introduce legislation in 
both houses of congress to provide the federal funding needed for 
the settlement 
theres still a lot of challenges dicks said the thing 
thats good is that now the tribe and the community will be working 
as a team 
frank wright jr who chaired the tribal council during the 1986 
settlement vote said one factor behind the tribes strong 
endorsement was fear over the outcome of a protracted court battle 
when you go to court nobody really wins and its a lengthy 
costly process and a lot of individuals realized that they 
wouldnt live long enough to see it resolved he said 
officials of the federal bureau of indian affairs said it was 
one of the biggest indian landclaim settlements ever proposed the 
native claims settlement act of 1971 provided 1 billion to settle 
claims on 44 million acres

the italian air force stunt team whose performance 
went tragically awry in west germany has had three other fatal 
crashes over the past decade 
sundays tragedy was the worst however three pilots of the 
famed troupe died when two planes plunged to the ground and a third 
veered uncontrollably into a huge air show crowd after flying over 
the us air base in ramstein 
authorities said at least 40 people were killed and 500 injured 
the three jets were part of a 10plane italian air force 
demonstration team frecce tricolori which means tricolor 
arrows and refers to the threecolored italian flag 
founded in 1930 as a school of aerobatics it has since 1956 
been a separate unit of the italian air force based at rivolto 
three members of the precision team have been killed in the 
previous air crashes 
one capt pier gianni petri was credited with saving the lives 
of spectators at a may 29 1979 air show at mildehall in britain 
by directing his g91 jet away from the crowd when it crashed 
two of the units g91 jets collided over the airport at rivolto 
on july 12 1978 killing one of the two pilots capt graziano 
carrer on sept 2 1981 another g91 crashed at rivolto killing 
capt antonio gallus 
the three pilots killed in the collision sunday at ramstein were 
lt col mario naldini 41 lt col ivo nutarelli 38 and capt 
giorgio alessio 31 italian air force officials said naldini had 
3900 flight hours nutarelli had 3800 and alessio had 1600

of experience and a minimum of 1000 hours of flight time military 
officials say that the team members actually have an average of 
3000 flight hours and an average age of 32 
the team appears at numerous shows in italy and abroad between

practicing its aerobatic routines 
during a show there are normally nine planes in formation one 
soloist and the commander remains on the field coordinating the 
action by radio

a former nun who left her 
religious order to enlist in the civil rights movement won a 
sevenyear legal battle when a judge ruled unconstitutional new 
jerseys system of paying for public education 
marilyn morheuser 64 said that at times during the fight she 
imagined she knew how david felt trying to slay goliath 
administrative law judge steven lefelt concluded thursday that 
the states funding discriminates against poor urban districts and 
perpetuates wide budget disparities between wealthy and poor school 
districts 
this case is about the failure of the state to provide an 
opportunity to develop childrens potential ms morheuser said 
i think we all suffer tremendously when children are not given 
opportunity to develop their full potential 
lefelts ruling is one of a few in the country in which state 
education funding has been declared unconstitutional it follows 
two decades of legal and legislative battles and could force the 
state to spend millions more each year to aid local schools in the 
198889 school year alone the state will spend more than 3 
billion 
lefelt concluded that a child in an affluent district clearly 
enjoys broad advantages over one in a poor urban district 
i believe this case comes down to whether this state desires 
to enhance the educational opportunity of students living in poor 
urban areas he said 
suffice it to say that i opt for providing equal opportunity 
to all our children no matter where they may live 
he endorsed a statewide school tax so all property owners pay 
the same rate and letting the state make up the difference so all 
students are paid for equally he called it the only way to control 
spending differences 
urban educators needed this victory to provide the opportunity 
for the urban children who are predominantly minority children 
said anthony scardaville superintendent of the irvington public 
school system whose 9000 enrollment is 82 percent black and 11 
percent hispanic everybody should have the same not good for 
the rich and mediocre for the poor 
the state had argued that pouring more money in poor districts 
was not a solution because their problems are mostly the result of 
bad management it also argued that more state money would erode 
local control of schools 
john samerjan a spokesman for gov thomas h kean said the 
ruling is one step in a long process but it would be mistaken to 
think it will bring a massive infusion of funds to poor 
districts 
the case has been closely watched around the country said allen 
odden a school finance expert at the university of southern 
california 
for ms morheuser the ruling is a landmark in a career that 
spans four decades 
after 16 teaching years as a nun in the sisters of loretto 
religious order she left the convent to help the national 
association for the advancement of colored people work on school 
desegregation for her the civil rights movement was absolutely 
essential for the continued viability of democracy in this 
country 
at 46 when most people are beginning to think about retirement 
ms morheuser entered law school to help litigate social 
changes 
in 1979 she became director of the newarkbased education law 
center which brought the lawsuit on behalf of 20 schoolage 
children in four poor urban districts she said the failure of a 
1975 school funding law was creating obvious and growing inequities 
between rich and poor districts 
i have always felt a particular affinity to this case because 
of my years of teaching she said 
a similar battle in the early 1970s led to passage of the 1975 
law but ms morheuser said that by 1979 it was obvious the system 
wasnt working 
education commissioner saul cooperman has 45 days to accept 
modify or reject lefelts ruling but lawyers for both sides 
predict the case eventually will go to the state supreme court

firefighters created their 
own inferno burning 500 acres of timber to save two towns and 
smother the largest fire in yellowstone national park 
by burning the forest ahead of the 182000acre clover mist 
fire firefighters said they finally scored a victory after weeks 
on the defensive the blaze would choke without fuel before it 
could cross a highway and bear down on crandall wyo cooke city 
mont both towns of 100 residents and valuable timber forests 
officials said 
it wanted to rear up and get us but were going to get it 
first said pat kaunert us forest service fire information 
officer were throwing everything weve got at it weve got to 
make a stand 
while they made their stand firefighters on sunday held ground 
elsewhere 
in western montana the 1900acre lolo creek fire was blocked 
after coming within 100 yards of eight homes along us 12 bombers 
dropped chemical retardant on the 8100acre fire between 
philipsburg and drummond 
in the absarokabeartooth wilderness north of yellowstone the 
39800acre storm creek fire was relatively calm but had burned 
several miles toward slough creek which leads into the park 
officials said 
in idaho firefighters battled blazes that have burned more than 
60000 acres fires continued out of control in the payette nez 
perce boise challis clearwater salmon caribou and idaho 
panhandle national forests and in the selwaybitterroot and frank 
church river of no return wilderness areas 
with the wind blowing back toward clover mist a crew of 19 
hot shots paraded through the timber sunday dropping a flaming 
mixture of diesel fuel and gasoline at their feet 
hey were having fun now one said as he followed the 
carefully orchestrated routes 
flames danced 100 feet into the smoke and bright red fire raced 
through the dry timber creating a ferocious roar heat became so 
intense in some spots that the hot shots had to shield their faces 
we have quite a safety plan and theres not much risk said 
bill miller chief of the crew spreading the fire the bitter root 
hot shots of montana were not into getting anyone burned up 
seven bulldozers cleared a 6mile 70footwide freeway 
through the pines saturday and sunday to provide a clear barrier to 
keep the manmade fire contained hand crews cleared out brush and 
timber then about 200 firefighters stood guard at the line armed 
with hoses fed by hottubsized water holding tanks they watched 
for hot spots and flying embers 
the forest service eager for its first victory against the 
fire had set the backfire for noon but had to wait until late 
afternoon for proper weather conditions helicopters and airplanes 
loaded with water and fire retardant stood by in case the wind 
shifted and blew flames back at the firefighters 
this is the moment weve been waiting for kaunert said 
if the fire gets over highway 212 wed be in a very bad 
position to defend the towns 
for more than a week smoke and flames climbing over the 
mountains that protect cooke city had troubled residents who were 
told friday to prepare for an evacuation that was never necessary 
three crandallarea ranches were evacuated saturday 
the forest service also was anxious to complete the back burn 
during the weekend because flames had jumped a ridge protecting the 
towns and a new weather front with the potential for gusty 
shifting winds was expected by tuesday 
the back burn showed the progess firefighters have made against 
blazes during the weekend throughout yellowstone where 450000 
acres have burned calm favorable winds cool night temperatures 
and even morning frost helped slow the march of the flames 
since early july the combination of mountaneous terrain and 
erratic winds in yellowstone which borders the shoshone forest 
gave clover mist the upper hand and forced firefighters to the 
defensive until sunday crews had been unable to mount a massive 
assault against clover mist 
we had to wait until it got to where we could get at it 
kaunert said this fire has kicked us for months now were going 
to kick it back 
in addition to the towns the fire also threatened some of the 
most productive timber land in the clarks fork ranger district 
enough timber is harvested annually out of the threatened area 
to build 100 homes forest service district ranger randy herzberg 
said 
its very valuable timber as far as the local economy goes

gerald jinks parker just cant 
understand how he could be facing a 5000 fine and five years in 
prison on charges of selling parts of the black bears he killed 
legally 
im selling mguns said parker 37 im selling mdogs i 
just cant afford it no more this just dont make no sense 
parker whose ancestors were cherokee indians lives on the 
cherokee indian reservation at the edge of the great smoky 
mountains national park 
all animals in the park including wild boar birds and bears 
are protected from hunting 
parker and 34 others were arrested on federal charges of killing 
or selling black bear in north carolina tennessee and georgia 
culminating a threeyear undercover investigation of poaching in 
the appalachians 
some of those arrested are charged with shooting bears in the 
smoky mountains park some are charged with hunting outside of the 
annual sixweek season still others like parker were charged not 
with an illegal kill but violating a law that prohibits the sale of 
any part of a black bear even one killed legally 
that puzzles parker 
if i shoot a bear should i just let it rot in the woods 
parker asked why cant i just sell it to feed my dogs pay for 
gas 
parker and others with deep roots in the appalachians have often 
found themselves at odds with those who protect wildlife over an 
act that is second nature to them hunting 
independent mountain folk often distrust central authority 
especially when laws conflict with family and community traditions 
said curtis w wood a history professor at western carolina 
university in cullowhee 
with some of them i dont think you can talk of this as a 
general disregard for the law wood said for some it is 
honest disagreement 
thomas l bennett a special agent with the us fish and 
wildlife service rode with a federal marshal in the unsuccessful 
search for parker who surrendered the next day 
its a passion for these people bennett said its a 
macho thing too many of these guys like the thrill of killing 
something anything and because their family did it on the land 
before them its their right too 
the black bear the smallest in the bear family typically is 5 
feet tall and weighs 200 pounds its head and feet make for 
startling trophies its hide can be used as a rug or wallhanging 
claws can become part of a necklace 
bear meat is a staple for many mountain residents and can bring 
a couple of dollars a pound but in recent years it is the bears 
gall bladder that has proved the most lucrative enticement for 
killing the animal 
on the oriental market powdered bear bladder can bring 540 an 
ounce or more the powder diluted with liquor is believed to make 
an aphrodisiac 
bennett said that following last weeks poacher roundup he has 
gotten calls from people who wanted to surrender rather than risk 
arrest 
well never stop it completely he said but we can put a 
dent in it

politicians called for a ban on 
air shows after three italian air force jets collided during a 
flying spectacle one of them slamming into a crowd in a fireball 
more than 40 people were killed 
at least several dozen of the roughly 500 people injured in 
sundays disaster at the ramstein us air base were in critical 
condition today west german news reports said 
it appeared to be the worlds worst air show tragedy involving 
spectators 
defense minister rupert scholz canceled an air show by west 
german warplanes planned for september and asked the countrys nato 
partners to consider abandoning similar demonstrations 
more than 300000 people most of them americans and west 
germans were watching as the italian precision teams 10 jets 
flying about 60 yards off the ground intersected over the field 
two planes plunged to the ground and the third veered 
uncontrollably out of formation flames spewing from its fuselage 
headed into the crowd and became an inferno 100 feet high and 
equally as wide 
terrified spectators ran for their lives as the flames scorched 
scores of people and destroyed buses trucks and cars 
a young woman who was slightly injured said she just barely 
escaped with her life 
my only thought was where can i go how can i get out of this 
alive the unidentified woman told the zdf television network 
i saw an opening among the masses of people and ran i stood 
there for an hour crying 
there are many children among the dead and injured said 
kris kumpf a medical assistant who treated some of the victims 
and the worst part of it is were still trying to find some of 
the parents 
sundays accident was the latest in a series of military crashes 
in west germany this year and had some federal and local officials 
demanding an end to air shows 
the events at ramstein confirm in a really horrible way how 
dangerous such spectacles are even for civilian observers said 
walter kolbow a federal lawmaker for the opposition social 
democratic party 
these air shows must be stopped once and for all said 
friedel laepple interior minister for saarland state 
afn the us military radio network reported today that at 
least 46 people were killed in sundays disaster at the base 60 
miles southwest of frankfurt but sgt eddie lee a ramstein 
spokesman said 41 people were confirmed dead 
he said bodies were still being identified and he did not know 
when a casualty list would be available 
on its final news broadcast sunday night zdf said 500 people 
were injured and 230 remained hospitalized many with severe burns 
following the disaster the us military set up special 
telephones that ramstein service members could use to call home in 
the states 
the british broadcasting corp said it was the worst air show 
disaster in terms of spectator deaths thirty people died when a 
dehaviland jet crashed into a crowd in 1952 at farnborough 
england the bbc said fortysix people most of them us army 
parachutists were killed in a helicopter crash at a 1982 air show 
in mannheim 
hansjuergen vollmer spokesman for the kaiserslautern 
administrative area that includes ramstein said he believed the 
accident was caused by pilot error he did not elaborate 
the italian mb 339a plowed into a row of cars and buses the 
second jet crashed into a wooded area and the third onto a ramstein 
runway air force officials said all three pilots were killed 
the three jets were part of a 10plane italian air force 
demonstration team frecce tricolori which means tricolor 
arrows and refers to the threecolored italian flag 
the ramstein air show has drawn protests for several years 
because of possible dangers to civilians demonstrators had 
protested outside the bases gates as sundays air show began 
the passau neue presse newspaper today suggested the disaster 
could sour west germans attitudes toward nato forces in their 
country 
pictures like those resulting from the ramstein tragedy will 
not strengthen the views of the citizens in important areas of 
defense preparations the newspaper said in a commentary 
several groups including the environmentalist greens party 
oppose military air shows because of the potential for such 
accidents 
at least seven aircraft accidents have occurred involving nato 
equipment this year in west germany one occurred at a hanover air 
show on may 7 when a british military chinook helicopters rotor 
blades struck a loading ramp two british airmen were killed and 12 
spectators injured 
the us embassy in bonn issued a statement offering condolences 
to the victims of sundays disaster 
we feel great compassion for the italian team the americans 
and the germans that were involved in todays tragic event our 
hearts go out to the families and friends of those involved in this 
catastrophe

hundreds of people jammed cliffs 
overlooking the beach today when a 46foot southern right whale 
swam into historic botany bay apparently to give birth 
the rare sight caused swimmers surfboard riders and divers to 
get a closer look 
wildlife officers placed a 200yard restriction zone around the 
83ton animal fearing the activity would antgonize it 
she has been very tolerant gentle and caring but she 
could be feeling sensitive particularly if shes about to calve 
said a spokeswoman for the national parks and wildlife service 
the whale was first sighted off the eastern coast a week ago 
officials said it was probably part of a herd migrating from 
antarctica 
botany bay named for its profusion of flora was the first 
landing of famed british navigator capt james cook who was

navy divers searched for three missing sailors 
today after rescuing 21 from the wreckage of a peruvian navy 
submarine that sank to the ocean floor after being rammed by a 
japanese tuna boat 
officials said the captain of the pacocha died while trying to 
save his men as the submarine sank friday evening about three miles 
off the port of callao eight miles west of lima 
three other crew members died and three were missing and 
presumed dead the navy said the missing men were believed to be 
inside waterfilled compartments of the submarine 100 feet below 
the surface 
on saturday rescuers used a diving bell to remove 21 sailors 
who had been trapped inside the vessel another 24 sailors were 
rescued friday night 
defense minister enrique lopez said the owners of the 412ton 
japanese fishing boat that struck the submarine could be fined the 
navy said the no 8 kyowamaru accidentally struck the submarine in 
the stern 
president alan garcia said a bad maneuver by the boat caused 
the collision 
there were no injuries among the 21 crewmen of the japanese 
boat which suffered cracks in its steel hull the japanese embassy 
said 
garcia praised the heroic valor of the officers aboard the 
pacocha saying the captain and others died attempting to save 
their fellow crewmen 
he gave precise orders to his crew closed the hatch and 
stayed on the bridge dying in the subsequent sinking lopez said 
following the funeral sunday of the 37yearold sailor 
the trapped sailors communicated with rescuers through sensors 
attached by divers to the crafts hull navy spokesman luis castro 
said officials said rescuers used a diving bell to pull the men to 
safety saturday 
the collision occurred as the pacocha was entering the port and 
the tuna boat departing castro said 
the pacocha purchased in 1974 from the united states is one of 
12 submarines in perus fleet one of the largest in the americas 
the 1870ton craft formerly the uss atule was commissioned 
on june 21 1944 according to janes fighting ships

the militarys bomb squad is 
nearly doubling as the united states tries to respond to world 
terrorism a navy officer says 
the navy recently opened a new 186 million training center at 
this base in the florida panhandle with the intent of graduating a 
new crop of explosive ordnance demolition technicians 
the move was needed partially because of the growing threat of 
international terrorism said lt cmdr hf mixter the officer 
in charge 
other factors he cited during a recent interview was that the 
worlds weaponry is far more sophisticated than it used to be 
and changes in battlefield strategies 
but he declined to get any more specific saying that 
information was classified 
teaching the new batch of bomb experts can have its 
difficulties he said 
one of the biggest challenges we have as instructors is that 
kids dont fix their bicycles any more mixter said theyd 
rather play with their video games 
indeed besides learning how to work in hazardous environments 
such as battlefields contaminated by chemical or nuclear weaponry 
students are introduced to the use of such simple items as wrenches 
and screwdrivers 
the eglin school one of only two of its kind in the us 
military trains army air force marine and some foreign military 
students as well as navy personnel 
defense officials began planning for additional training and the 
school three years ago when a survey showed an 89 percent increase 
in explosives ordnance demolition technicians would be required by 
the four services between 1985 and 1990 mixter said 
the school was built at eglin the wests largest air base at 
724 square miles because it had enough space to accommodate the 
school that space allows for test ranges where explosives can be 
set off and the regions normally temperate weather permits 
yearround outdoor activity 
another factor is that of the few bases meeting those criteria 
it is the closest to the naval explosive ordnance disposal school 
at indian head md the militarys only other center for 
bombsquad training 
the new school has a staff of 23 officers and 160 enlisted 
personnel about 45 officers and 280 enlisted people are in 
training at any given time approximately 20 percent are women 
about 1200 students are expected to graduate each year 
mixter said the common training for all branches relatively 
rare in the us military pays off when explosive ordnance 
demolition technicians from different services work together in the 
field 
regardless of the service you know that he knows what you 
know mixter said 
students here get a basic 11week course they then either go 
into the field or fleet as explosive ordnance demolition assistants 
or to indian head for more training 
students are taught to locate explosive devices including 
unexploded bombs that have burrowed into the ground and identify 
them according to type function and national origin 
students get an opportunity to try out techniques for disposing 
of weapons by setting off explosives at the test sites 
we are not heroes we are technicians mixter said the 
purpose of the drill is to remove the hazards with the least 
possible damage including loss of life when they leave here 
we want them to be part of the solution not part of the problem

a rocket carrying two soviets and the first afghan 
in space blasted off from a central asian space center today to 
join cosmonauts seeking an endurance record aboard the orbiting 
soviet space station mir 
a proton rocket carrying pilot vladimir lyakhov dr valery 
polyakov and afghan military pilot abdul ahad mohmand aboard a 
soyuz tm6 capsule blasted off from the baikonur space center on 
schedule 
officials said polyakov would monitor the health of two 
cosmonauts who have been aboard mir since december 
soviet television provided a live broadcast of the white rocket 
riding a long orange flame into the clear sky and cut away as the 
rocket disappeared 
the official tass news agency said the soyuz capsule had reached 
orbit that the flight was proceding normally and that the 
cosmonauts felt fine 
the crew is scheduled to dock wednesday with the mir complex 
mohmand 29 was to take part in efforts to identify oil gas 
and other mineral deposits in afghanistan as well as predicting 
runoff of snow and glaciers to alleviate a water shortage 
he also was to help try to identify where earthquakes might 
occur in afghanistan 
the mission was an ideal way for the kremlin to reassure 
afghanistan of support and friendship as it pulls its military 
force out of the country 
the afghan government of president najib is locked in a long war 
with antimarxist insurgents and increasingly is being left to 
fight on its own as the 100000 soviet soldiers withdraw 
under an agreement signed in april in geneva the soviet union 
withdrew half the force between may 15 and aug 15 and the 
remainder must be withdrawn by feb 15 1989 soviet forces 
intervened in december 1979 
being a son of my proud people i will carry along not only joy 
but also sorrow for my homeland gripped by a fratricidal war 
mohmand said in a statement broadcast from the capsule before 
liftoff 
brothers stop the war and direct your forces toward building 
a durable national peace he said 
lyakhov the 47yearold pilot was making his third space 
flight he was in space for 175 days in 1979 and a member of a 
150day mission in 1983 
polyakov 46 was sent to check on the health of cosmonauts 
vladimir titov and musa manarov who have been in space since dec 
21 and are scheduled to remain at the mir complex until this 
december 
polyakov will remain at the space station for an unspecified 
period after lyakhov and mohmand end their eightday mission 
officials said polyakov also will supervise experiments on the 
effects of space travel on the human body 
titov and manarov replaced a crew that included yuri romanenko 
who now holds the space endurance record of 326 days 
space officials say the endurance tests are a step toward 
determining the feasibility of a manned flight to mars which they 
estimate would take three years 
replacements for titov 40 and manarov 37 will be sent aloft 
in a monthlong sovietfrench mission in november 
the afghansoviet mission is the second of three international 
flights scheduled this year in the soviet manned space program 
the us manned program has been grounded since the january 1986 
explosion of the shuttle challenger though the shuttle discovery 
is scheduled to be launched in late september of early october 
a bulgarian cosmonaut and two soviet colleagues returned to 
earth june 17 after a 10day flight that included a linkup with mir

a houdinistyle escape artist was thrown 
from an airplane in a locked coffinlike box and said he was 
confident all the way while escaping handcuffs and chains and 
parachuting to safety 
it was fantastic said anthony martin 22 a professional 
escape artist from sheboygan wis after sundays stunt most 
people thought i was going to die on this one but the whole 
thing went picture perfect 
martin performed the feat before about 500 people who watched at 
skydive sandwich a parachuting center in southern de kalb county 
directed by champion skydiver roger nelson 
it all went as planned and im very glad because i certainly 
wouldnt have wanted to have been part of a disaster said 
nelson who accompanied the box out of the plane along with an 
assistant to stabilize it 
we were just trying to keep the box from tumbling like crazy 
and knocking him out nelson said i wouldnt do it myself 
i told him yesterday that he could be killed 
martin wore a parachute and an altimeter to measure the altitude 
when he was placed in the 2by2by6foot wooden freight box 
painted bright yellow 
a neck noose of padlocked chains was attached to a ring at the 
top of the box and his hands were chained to the sides by two 
pairs of handcuffs 
the box was closed with a jail celltype lock and loaded onto 
the twinengine turboprop jet 
the box was pushed out at 13500 feet and at 7500 feet martin 
jumped clear and parachuted as planned onto a field belonging to 
farmer howard gast about 10 miles from the skydiving center 
i was pretty sure hed make it but i was nervous when he 
didnt come out quickly said gast who watched through field 
glasses i guess hes trying to prove hes the second houdini 
and it was a pretty good stunt 
nelson said he had nervous moments when martin had not emerged 
from the box after falling almost halfway to the ground we were 
starting to wonder what was going on but then he suddenly freed 
himself 
but martin said that during the 25 to 30 seconds it took to free 
himself he was confident all the way and didnt have time to 
think about anything except getting out 
i expected to get banged around and almost killed but the box 
fell very stable and i figured that i was all right 
martin said he conceived the idea about a year ago because he 
wanted to do the best and hardest escape ever done 
he spent about three months practicing getting out of the 
coffin and a week in july learning how to skydive with nelson 
martin said he has escaped from coffins lowered into rivers 
electrically charged boxes jails and bank vaults he declined to 
explain how he freed himself sunday saying it would force him to 
reveal trade secrets learned since he first began doing escapes at 
age 10

the little fellow defiantly assumed the 
position some 600 years ago 
since 1388 manneken pis has been answering natures longest 
call at a brussels street corner 
actually since before then but we go by 1388 says antoine 
demol president of the order of friends of manneken pis 
demol is in charge of a twoday celebration starting sept 3 
with marching bands dixieland music majorettes and folkloric 
events in the downtown area where manneken pis spouts water rain 
or shine 
firsttime visitors to the little man are bound to be 
disappointed by the figure only slightly more than 21 inches high 
but it is one of the strangest statues anywhere 
from a raised niche at the corner of rue de chene and rue de 
letuve the mananeken pis urinates into a small basin smiling 
tauntingly and leaning slightly backward 
few statues can boast a history as that of the manneken 
documents at city hall dating back to 1388 refer to the 30 public 
fountains which then provided potable water to the citizens of 
brussels said demol 
they mention a water pipe feeding the manneken pis 
in the 14th century such imagery was considered folksy fun 
other curious fountains from those days still exist nearby 
the three virgins spout water from their breasts and the 
spitter is a man with water cascading from his mouth 
but who is the manneken 
his origins are rooted in many legends some historically more 
correct than others said demol 
one has it that a toddler saved brussels from a blaze in the 
13th centrury by urinating on the lighted fuse of an incendiary 
bomb 
another legend says an urchin relieved himself against the door 
of a sorcerer who condemned the boy to that stance forever 
usually the manneken is naked but you may also see him in one 
of 447 costumes that have been bestowed on him in the past 300 
years 
the present statue was cast in 1619 for still unknown reasons 
the elector of bavaria donated a costume for the boy in 1698 
his second outfit came from king louis xv of france in 1747 as 
an apology for his soldiers who damaged the manneken said demol 
donating outfits became a custom so far 447 have been given by 
governments service clubs and folkloric and trade groups worldwide 
they show the statue in military finery from many nations or 
dressed as maurice chevalier an american football player a 
shriner a member of the montreal canadiens hockey team a sioux 
indian or as elvis presley 
on sept 3 we will give the manneken his 448th costume that 
of the order of the friends of manneken pis said demol 
manneken pis has paid a price for his fame he has been stolen 
least seven times the last time in 1978 as a student prank 
the culprits got off with a warning one antoine lucas was not 
so lucky in 1817 he yanked the statue off its base and got 20 
years at hard labor 
demols 33yearold order promotes manneken pis as brussels 
goodwill ambassador 
no one ever complains that the statue is obscene he said 
and of course it isnt 
the kid is only five he cannot be obscene you must 
understand that to the citizens of brussels manneken pis 
symbolizes resistance to fanaticism simple civil disobedience 
a special treat awaits visitors during the twoday festivities 
around manneken pis 
several times during those two days said demol manneken 
pis will serve wine to passersby in his own peculiar way

two jurors in the trial of 20 people who had 
been accused of being mobsters say the judges instructions were 
misunderstood and led the panel to mistakenly acquit the defendants 
on all charges 
helen bove said she and some other jurors did not say anything 
when the verdict was read friday because they expected federal 
prosecutors to ask for a poll of the jury polling the jury is a 
common practice that can prompt the judge to order further 
deliberations or declare a mistrial 
the jury that heard the 22monthlong us district court trial 
made its decision after 14 hours of deliberations over two days 
the defendants who were accused of being members of the lucchese 
crime family cheered 
why didnt they poll the jury asked ms bove of 
wallington there were several of us who voted guilty on some 
counts 
assistant us attorney v grady omalley the lead prosecutor 
said he did not request a poll because at that point it was 
apparent to me that they were rejecting the governments case 
without even looking at the evidence it would not have made a 
difference 
but ms bove said sunday it would have made a difference 
according to the jury instructions by judge harold a ackerman 
the jury was to weigh each of the 77 counts against the defendants 
and come to a unanimous decision on each 
each of your verdicts must be unanimous it must be 120 
whether you find each individual guilty or not guilty on each 
count i can accept nothing less than a unanimous verdict the 
judge said 
but ackermans instructions also said if you are not 
unanimous as to each essential element of the particular offense 
you must return a verdict of not guilty as to that particular 
offense 
ms bove said the jury mistakenly took that to mean if jurors 
disagreed on the guilt or innocence of defendants on a particular 
charge they were to return an innocent verdict rather than 
continue to deliberate until a unanimous decision was reached or 
end up with a hung jury 
we all read it and read it and read it and we thought thats 
what it was ms bove said in some cases there wasnt enough 
evidence to convict there were so many counts but in others there 
was 
we misread the whole thing said james tyminski of fair lawn 
referring to the instructions we are laymen how are we supposed 
to understand all of that 
the acquittals after one of the longest federal criminal cases 
in us history were a monumental blow to the governments fight 
against organized crime 
ms bove also said some jurors apparently exasperated by the 
length of the trial declined to review evidence during 
deliberations 
some of them said lets just get it over with she said 
i believe that these other jurors didnt do their job right 
ms bove said not because they didnt believe what i did but 
because they refused to cooperate and do the work necessary

two of the citys three leading black mayoral 
contenders were absent from a blackonly convention that was 
intended to unite the community behind a single candidate but was 
considered racist by some 
activist lu palmer who helped organize saturdays event that 
drew about 1000 people said he considered it an insult that 
mayor eugene sawyer and alderman timothy evans didnt show 
the crowd was held down because saywer and evans said they 
wouldnt come palmer said but people are angry that they 
didnt have the strength to address their base those who didnt 
appear hurt themselves 
chicagos third leading black mayoral contender alderman danny 
k davis received a standing ovation from those at the black 
peoples convention 
delegates are scheduled to poll community groups they represent 
and return in two weeks to select a candidate 
i find it very easy to support a black agenda davis told 
the crowd its not difficult at all because whats good for 
black people in chicago is good for white people and hispanic 
people 
palmer told the delegates he fears that if all three black 
candidates remain in the race it would leave the political arena 
wide open for a white candidate to become mayor in a special 
election 
that would be a reversal of what we fought so hard to gain in 
these past years he said 
the election has tentatively been set for 1989 but the illinois 
supreme court is considering a challenge seeking to postpone it 
until 1991 when the late harold washingtons term would have 
expired 
sawyer was elected acting mayor when washington the citys 
first black mayor died in november sawyer strategists prefer 
delaying the election believing he would benefit from a longer 
incumbency 
evans who is delaying announcing his candidacy until the court 
rules said he objected to convention rules that excluded all but 
black churches and black community groups 
too many other elements of the progressive agenda were 
excluded he said i want to present my candidacy to all the 
city and win not for my race but for what i can do for everyone 
sawyer condemned the convention for not representing the city 
he was in washington dc on saturday for the 25th anniversary of 
the rev martin luther king jrs i have a dream speech 
john mcdermott chairman of the committee on decent unbiased 
campaign tactics called the convention a step backward for 
chicago 
these actions are deeply divisive and tend to give racial 
identity a preeminence in our political and civic life which it 
does not deserve he said 
so far no white democratic candidate has emerged 
ed howlett the only announced white candidate is a republican

star quality was measured by arrival 
time at the 40th annual emmy awards as is always true among the 
hollywood set the truly chic arrived late 
strolling in just 25 minutes before the 5 pm show time was 
heavyweight boxing champion mike tyson and wife actress robin 
givens just 5 inutes before soontobe awarded michael j fox 
arrived with new wife actress tracy pollan who played foxs 
girlfriend on the nbc comedy series family ties 
earlier arrivals included william shatner 245 pm and ann 
jillian 335 pm 
nominated actors and actresses kept mostly quiet about their 
chances in the annual exercises of selfcongratulation 
most in fact said pretty much the same thing 
its hot isnt it noted jobeth williams nominated for her 
work in the abc miniseries baby m 
its very warm said john larroquette later to receive his 
fourthstraight emmy for his night court effort on nbc 
yeah its hot said fox 
you get the point 
the celebrities and even the hangerson were welcomed by 
hundreds of fans some of whom staked out spots across from the 
auditorium beginning at 6 am sunday 
the crowd six deep in the withering pasadena weather greeted 
the stars arriving in limousines with shrill squeals of delight 
while those stepping from a volkswagen or honda went largely 
unnoticed 
one of the more unusual twists in the arrival pandemonium was 
the entrance of entertainment tonight reporter leeza gibbons 
as she stepped out of her limousine miss gibbons was met with a 
barrage of shrieks from fans she then posed for photographers 
lining the steps when she was done with the limelight miss 
gibbons went to work climbing into the press area to conduct 
interviews 
like the academy awards the emmys traditionally attract some of 
the more elaborate outfits in hollywood winner for the most 
outrageous getup this year went to jean kasem actress wife of

lavender dress and a matching turbanlike headwrap her husband 
not to detract wore a simple black tuxedo 
diane brill who no one seemed to recognize from any television 
show nevertheless turned many heads with a dress of seethrough 
mesh placed in a number of strategic places most below the waist 
tyson dressed down for the event he was unable to wear his 
tuxedo coat because of the large cast on his right hand the boxer 
who broke his hand last week in a harlem altercation with a former 
opponent did at least put a fresh gleaming white plaster wrap on 
the cast 
two signs competed for the cameras eye one praised cagney amp

for a moment the air show crowd 
of 300000 stood hushed as an italian military jet veered and 
tumbled into their midst 
there was this incredible silence air force staff sgt john 
flanagan was quoted as saying it was like the crowd was in 
shock then there was a second muffled explosion and more fire and 
thats when people started running screaming 
i saw this little boy his hair was all singed and the skin 
was coming off his face flanagan told the unofficial us 
military newspaper stars and stripes nobody stopped to help him 
they were running we stopped the police and the police picked him 
up 
at least 40 people were killed and hundreds injured as three 
italian jets crashed at ramstein us air base on sunday one 
exploded in a fireball amid the crowd burning scores of people 
some were missing skin on their arms said stars and stripes 
reporter deedee arrington doke also an witness a lot had black 
burns like their skin was burned black 
she said that after the crash people started crying and 
screaming the ones who were stopped were hugging each other and 
crying like they were saying what are we going to do the ones 
who were running were screaming 
the 10plane italian precision flying team had intersected about 
60 yards above the ground when two planes plunged to the ground 
and the third veered into the crowd 
jim beichler a university of maryland instructor told the 
stars and stripes that when the planes collided there was a 
silence 
the plane blew up and people started running one guy was on 
fire other people were wrapped up in barbed wire there were small 
fires all around me he said 
witnesses described a sunny sunday that turned into a blackened 
scene of panic and suffering 
i saw the fire ball and then the noise hit me american 
witness barry miller told the afn us military radio network it 
sounded like somebody running into an aluminum garage or 
something 
the italian aermacchi mb 339a plowed into a row of cars and 
buses bursting into a ball of flames at least 100 feet high and 
wide 
we saw the fireball racing toward us so we first threw 
ourselves down on the ground said detlef hosser a ncameraman 
for the ard television network 
a young woman who was slightly injured said she just barely 
escaped with her life 
i heard the jets colliding it was a terrible crash my only 
thought was where can i go how can i get out of this alive the 
unidentified woman told the zdf television network 
i saw an opening among the masses of people and ran in that 
direction and made it i stood there for an hour crying she said 
scores of people were burned many children were among the dead 
said kris kumpf a young medical assistant who treated some of the 
victims 
and the worst part of it is were still trying to find some 
of the parents she said trembling and sobbing at a nearby inn 
she joined others phoning relatives at the inn assuring her 
mother she was fine but there are too many dead 
people came in here with their clothes torn and their arms 
bleeding just to call home to say they were safe said walter 
schlenz who owns the inn in this town 60 miles southwest of 
frankfurt 
an elderly west german man at the inn said the accident occurred 
when two groups of italian jets were performing a maneuver just 
above the airfield 
five of the planes came from one direction and four came head 
on in another a single plane came from yet another direction and 
there was a crash 
all i saw was a big ball of fire said the man who would 
not give his name 
hours after the crash the airfield was scattered with paper 
cups beer cases and turnedover lawn chairs left by fleeing 
spectators 
a smoky stench still clotted the air

zookeepers and elephants are mourning the death 
of the san diego zoos oldest and most popular elephant a 
10000pound matriarch that led the herd for 47 years and 
entertained millions of tourists 
the 51yearold asian elephant named lucki was put to sleep 
sunday because her health had deteriorated to where she could no 
longer stand even with the help of a forklift said spokesman jeff 
jouett 
she was one of most popular and bestloved animals at the 
zoo said jouett who estimated that 102 million tourists had 
seen her over the years 
lucki who came to san diego in 1941 from a zoo in calcutta 
india was the zoos biggest and most dominant elephant she stood 
9 feet at the shoulder 
its a major passage in the zoo elephant herd when the 
matriarch dies jouett said the current elephant keepers love 
her dearly and are stunned by her loss its a subdued day at 
the zoo 
about 10 years ago lucki started suffering from chronic tooth 
and foot ailments jouett said 
in 1981 lucki became the first captive elephant to have a tooth 
pulled keepers regularly trimmed her foot pads to lessen her 
problems which were caused by lack of exercise 
but during the past week her condition worsened because of an 
infection in her front feet sunday morning lucki was unable to 
stand 
the veterinarian believes she reputured the muscles in her 
back legs while trying to push herself up jouett said they 
tried coaxing her up they brought in a forklift with a crane 
attached there was no way she could move 
after consulting with elephant keepers and curator of mammals 
rick barongi veterinarian don janssen injected the fatal shot of a 
drug the spokesman said 
among the witnesses were the zoos director doug myers who 
came in on his day off and eight former or present elephant 
keepers the zoos five other elephants were brought in later 
elephants are very intelligent and they can understand why one 
of their own is no longer with them jouett said they do a 
very similar thing in the wild so maya and other elephants got an 
hour to pay last respects 
maya is a 49yearold asian elephant that came from india with 
lucki and was her best friend he said 
as matriarch lucki was always the first in the herd to eat and 
enter the yard from the barn jouett said she also was responsible 
for disciplining members of the herd as well as defending it from 
intruders 
asian elephants have lived to nearly age 70 in captivity but 
are believed to have shorter life spans in the wild jouett said 
luckis body was transported to the zoos hospital for a necropsy

strike leaders said thousands of workers 
joined a stoppage at a huge southeastern steel mill today when 
management tried to reopen it two weeks into polands worst labor 
unrest since 1981 
word of the broadened strike at the stalowa wola steel and heavy 
machinery plant came a day after communist authorities said they 
might let solidarity leader lech walesa take part in broadbased 
reconciliation talks 
management had ordered the 18000worker plant closed friday 
because of a strike that began a week ago but allowed workers into 
the yard this morning and more than 5000 joined the roughly 1000 
strikers said piotr niemczyk of the solidarity information center 
in warsaw 
phone calls to management at the defenserelated plant were not 
answered but staterun polish radio said seven plant departments 
were affected it accused strikers of entering working 
departments by force making operation impossible 
on sunday polish leader wojciech jaruzelski endorsed the idea 
proposed by authorities of a roundtable discussion with strike 
leaders 
in a speech broadcast to the nation at the end of a twoday 
meeting of the communist partys policymaking central committee 
he directed his most severe criticism at the partyappointed 
government of prime minister zbigniew messner 
gen jaruzelski said that by failing to deal with economic and 
political tensions the government had helped precipitate the 
strikes that began aug 16 
the general who heads the communist party refrained from 
directly blaming the solidarity free trade union movement for the 
strike wave and hinted at a government shakeup in the near future 
communist party spokesman jerzy majka said the government was 
prepared for reconciliation talks without any preconditions but 
added that he had no information on when such talks could begin 
he called walesa one of the possible candidates for 
participation in such talks but added that no one could take part 
as a representative of an illegal organization 
its up to the other side to make the first move majka 
added 
in addition to higher wages to offset inflation of nearly 60 
percent the strikers have demanded demand the legalization of 
solidarity which was banned after being crushed in a 1981 military 
crackdown 
walesa last held a meeting with highlevel communist authorities 
in early 1982 before he was released from internment 
in gdansk walesa rejoined striking workers at the lenin 
shipyard sunday morning injuring himself slightly as he hauled 
himself over the 7foot fence after a police officer tried to stop 
him aides said 
solidarity estimated today that about 13500 people were 
occupying 10 strikebound workplaces about 20 enterprises were 
idled at the height of the strike wave 
in the baltic port of szczecin talks between management and 
representatives of striking dockers broke off and a management 
attempt to hold talks with striking bus employees failed as well 
the staterun news agency pap reported 
but in the southwestern city of jastrzebie workers at the 
jastrzebie coal mine agreed to end their strike after a meeting 
with management pap reported only the july manifesto coal mine 
where the labor unrest began two weeks ago remains on strike in 
the silesian town not far from the czechoslovak border 
police evicted strikers from several workplaces last week but 
there was no use of force to end strikes over the weekend 
in gdansk on sunday police blocked about 400 people who set off 
after a mass at st brygidas church from approaching the 
strikebound lenin shipyard a few blocks away the crowd dispersed 
peacefully 
the latest bid for national reconciliation by jaruzelski who 
led the 1981 crackdown on solidarity appears to leave the decision 
on potential discussion partners for the round table up to the 
opposition 
efforts earlier this summer to draw senior solidarity advisers 
into informal talks with lowranking party and government officials 
on the economic malaise met with only limited success 
the idea for roundtable talks was proposed friday by interior 
minister czeslaw kiszczak who said they would be to take up 
grievances of striking workers after the strikes as long as they 
observed the nations legal and constitutional order 
jaruzelski made no immediate recommendation to shake up 
messners government but said party deputies would decide when 
parliament next meets most likely in september 
ending its meeting the central committee passed a resolution 
endorsing continuation of economic and political reform with no 
halfway measures but condemning lawbreaking and 
destruction a reference to strikes 
on the meetings opening day a number of the central 
committees 230 members launched harsh attacks on the government 
and their speeches were later televised 
we are not used in the party to criticizing the government 
from the rostrum of the central committee that we have always done 
in the family silently jaruzelski said now we are finishing 
with that practice

michael dukakis said today he is 
confident he can halt the recent surge of republican opponent 
george bush adding i know we can do it together 
the democratic nominee kicked off a twoday visit to western 
massachusetts by meeting with local officials here where he cited 
the areas resurgent economy as an example of the publicprivate 
partnership approach he promises to bring to the white house if 
elected president 
its going to be a long hard competitive race dukakis told 
a breakfast sponsored by the northern berkshire chamber of 
commerce one thing that inspires me every day and every week out 
there on the campaign trail is that i know we can do it 
together because ive seen it happen 
dukakis also visited an abandoned mill complex being coverted 
into a major art museum and the basketball hall of fame where he 
was to deliver an economic development speech 
the western massachusetts trip comes as democratic strategists 
within and outside the dukakis campaign are urging dukakis to take 
a more aggressive stance in response to daily attacks from bush and 
gop vice presidential nominee dan quayle 
while dukakis frequently denounces negative campaigning he 
hinted strongly saturday he was nearing the point where he would 
return bushs salvos which range from attacks on dukakis 
patriotism to jokes about his height 
remember 1982 its ed king all over again dukakis said 
saturday night on a flight home from washington 
king defeated dukakis in 1978 only to lose four years later in a 
rematch that was considered one of the nastiest and most aggressive 
campaigns in state history 
its getting the juices out early dukakis said in 1982 
king was on with negative television on me beginning in february i 
mean nonstop never got off every single week bang bang bang 
bang 
did it hurt sure it hurt but at the appropriate point 
people i think had a sense that enough is enough you come back 
and basically you make the needed adjustments 
since the democratic convention with few exceptions dukakis 
has stressed his message of economic opportunity while facing gop 
attacks on his positions on defense crime the pledge of 
allegiance and gun control 
dukakis speaking to reporters on the flight recalled that john 
f kennedy and lyndon johnson got bogged down with congressional 
duties after the 1960 democratic convention but bounced back to 
win seemingly a reference to the time he is forced to dedicate to 
being governor 
with bush surging and labor day on the horizon dukakis plans to 
cut his statehouse time to one day a week and his campaign is 
preparing to unleash a round of television advertising probably 
within a week of labor day 
and while dukakis frequently exhorts bush to focus on the 
issues he has a history of firing back when he believes he has 
come under undue attack 
in 1982 for example dukakis was under harsh attack from king 
in the weeks leading up to a televised debate before the program 
began dukakis was asked to check his microphone and rattled off 
figures about increasing crime during the king administration the 
move startled king and he floundered through the debate as dukakis 
assailed him for running a corrupt administration dukakis under 
attack from missouri rep richard gephardt during the presidential 
primaries also aired an ad noting gephardts flip flops on a 
number of issues 
while many democratic party officials have said the dukakis 
campaign appears to have lost the steam it had coming out of the 
democratic convention the candidate himself appears undaunted 
smiling at the reporters questioning his campaigns recent 
efforts dukakis said simply its only august

sen dan quayle readying for this weeks 
southern campaign swing says he will eventually be an asset to 
the republican ticket and overcome the controversies that have 
stalked his candidacy 
in an interview sunday with the associated press as he flew home 
from his first solo campaign trip as the gop vice presidential 
nominee quayle acknowledged that he was still getting used to his 
new situation 
its a little bit new but what i will continue to do is just 
project my vision of america talk about why george bush will offer 
the best hope for continued prosperity 
quayle says he talks periodically but not daily to bush 
and that the two men will probably spend more time campaigning 
separately than together in order to better cover the country 
quayle 41 comes from a wealthy indiana publishing family and 
his candidacy has been dogged by suggestions that strings were 
pulled to get him into the national guard during the vietnam war 
and law school after a mediocre college performance quayle has 
denied those charges but the issues have threatened at times to 
overwhelm his campaign 
some major newspapers in editorials this week suggested that he 
remove himself from the ticket and even some republicans have 
admitted being uncomfortable with the senator who was largely an 
unknown quantity when he was picked in the interview quayle said 
he has had no second thoughts about running and was not hurt by 
suggestions he step down 
i will eventually be an asset to the ticket quayle said 
i feel that i have a lot to offer in leadership i feel i have a 
lot to offer in the area of national defense i feel that i have 
worked very hard in the area of arms control 
meanwhile the boston globe reported monday that quayle who 
would head the federal fight against drugs if bush won in november 
said he did not know that the vice president heads a key antidrug 
program 
quayle told the newspaper he was familiar in a general sense 
with the national narcotics border interdiction system but did not 
know who led it bush has headed the system since it was created in 
1983 
in his remarks to the ap quayle said he was proud of his work 
with sen edward m kennedy dmass on a 1982 jobs training act 
which is very important to millions of people that have gotten 
jobs around america 
quayle also said he hoped to release his income tax returns soon 
because they would dispel notions that he is fabulously wealthy 
i keep telling them to get it out as soon as possible so we 
can get rid of another untruth out there about how wealthy i really 
am quayle said youre going to be shocked when you see 
those tax returns 
quayle traveled to the midwest and west last week and will 
leave again wednesday for a swing through the southeast that will 
take him through to labor day 
in last weeks sevenstate trip quayle spent little time 
talking about his democratic counterpart sen lloyd bentsen 
except to praise bentsen for his views on defense spending and 
other issues most of his speeches outline a view that a victory by 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis would be a disaster 
for the country 
ive served with sen bentsen for almost eight years he is 
not the issue quayle said the issue is michael dukakis 
michael dukakis view of america is a much different view than 
george bushs michael dukakis approach to national defense his 
approach to the economy his approach to child care all of those 
approaches are much different than george bushs 
quayle said he is not disturbed by polls that show much of the 
public views bentsen as more qualified for the vice presidential 
spot and to be president if it comes to that 
the american people are just beginning to see dan quayle he 
said im going to continue to talk about the issues when we 
have the debate between lloyd bentsen and dan quayle the american 
people will have a lot better picture of who will be the best 
qualified vice presidential candidate

a veterans administration hospital has 
allowed cardiologists to perform a delicate procedure on 70 heart 
patients without a backup staff of heart surgeons a published 
report said today 
the cardiologists who are not surgeons but are trained in 
internal medicine performed coronary angioplasties a nonsurgical 
procedure to unclog arteries at the long beach veterans 
administration hospital the los angeles times reported 
by not having heart surgeons on the staff the practice placed 
heart patients in unnecessary danger according to a recent 
national task force report on angioplasty the times said 
angioplasty an increasingly common alternative to coronary 
artery bypass surgery unclogs heart arteries with a balloontipped 
hollow tube inserted through the skin and threaded through a vein 
in the groin to the heart 
dr victor froelicher chief of cardiology at the long beach va 
and dr arthur graham a spokesman for the veterans headquarters 
in washington said the hospitals program was safe and has had no 
significant complications 
they said a helicopter is ready to transport surgical 
emergencies to memorial medical center of long beach about 5 miles 
away 
but va spokeswoman donna st john in washington said a team of 
va and outside experts will conduct an onsite review of the long 
beach angioplasty program within the next few weeks 
this month a joint american college of cardiologyamerican 
heart association task force recommended that all hospitals 
offering angioplasty have an experienced heart surgery team 
available at the hospital to perform emergency surgery 
their comprehensive angioplasty guidelines emphasize that 
there should be no exception to this requirement and said 
transporting patients offsite for surgery cannot be condoned

a team of researchers is trying to raise 14 
million to retrieve a 1961 project mercury space capsule from its 
resting place deep in the atlantic ocean off grand bahama island 
astronaut virgil gus grissom who was later killed with two 
other astronauts when the apollo 1 capsule caught fire in 1967 was 
on board the mercury capsule which sank after splashdown some 
accounts say grissom caused the capsule to sink by detonating 
explosive charges prematurely 
theres a piece of american space history three miles down out 
there and we believe we can locate it and if it can be located 
then it can be recovered said curt newport who is leading the 
search for liberty bell 7 
sidescan sonar devices similar to those employed in 1985 to 
locate the luxury liner titanic at a depth of 2 miles would be 
used to hunt for liberty bell 7 newport said 
once the capsule was found he said a manned submersible vessel 
would be used to attach a cable to the oneton spaceship and reel 
it to the surface 
so far however there are no sponsors for the project 
when i started looking into this back in late 1984 i always 
thought that the most difficult part would be to convince people 
that it could be recovered newport said now im finding that 
the most difficult part is to locate someone willing to pay for 
it 
newport said the project has the backing of former astronaut 
thomas stafford gregg linebaugh an analyst with the goddard space 
flight center in maryland is a project partner newport said 
the july 21 1961 suborbital flight splashed down just 15 
minutes after liftoff in the atlantic ocean about 300 miles 
southeast of cape canaveral 
a navy helicopter was supposed to hook onto the capsule and lift 
it a few feet above the water so grissom could safely exit from the 
side escape 
as the chopper hovered overhead however explosive charges 
mounted on the hatch apparently detonated prematurely allowing 
the capsule to fill with water grissom managed to swim out before 
the capsule sank 
some accounts including one in the novel and movie the right 
stuff suggest grissom panicked and blew the hatch too soon the 
national aeronautics and space administration however absolved 
grissom of blame 
grissom was one of the seven original mercury astronauts and the 
second american to roar into space atop an 85foot redstone rocket 
newport said any chance of establishing what really happened 
depends on finding the hatch door where the explosives detonator 
was mounted but the findings might be inconclusive he said 
because the detonator switch could have been flipped by some force 
other than grissom such as a powerful vacuum created during 
reentry 
newport who lives in annapolis md and works for a nasa 
subcontractor helping design americas first space station said he 
doubts that any significant flight data might be aboard but 
researchers believe its possible that onboard cameras might have 
film that could be developed if the equipment survived the 
underwater pressures

foreign minister tariq aziz of iraq today accused 
iran of stalling peace talks by rejecting the immediate reopening 
of the shattalarab waterway iraqs only outlet to the sea 
the disputed waterway has been blocked by sunken ships since the 
outbreak of the 8yearold persian gulf war 
the peace talks resumed today at a downgraded technical level 
because both countries foreign ministers removed themselves after 
a snag developed late sunday over iraqi demands for full 
sovereignty over the shattalarab 
un secretarygeneral perez de cuellar met for six hours sunday 
night with the separate delegations and acknowleged the talks had 
run into difficulties over the withdrawal of troops behind 
internationally recognized borders 
in reply to a question the un leader said we cannot say 
now that we have reached deadlock the possibility always 
exists 
with negotiations on the verge of a deadlock aziz said at a 
morning news conference we have not found any measure of good 
faith from the other side since the peace talks started last week 
i hope we will move back to the ministerial level as soon as 
the disagreement is settled perez de cuellar said 
the negotiations are continuing without underrating the 
difficulties that we face at the moment added un spokesman 
francois giuliani 
aziz said the immediate clearing of the shattalarab would 
allow iraq to regain use of its only outlet to the sea 
the foreign minister said this would provide an equitable 
balance to the acceptance by iraq of freedom of navigation for 
iranian vessels in the gulf already enforced in accordance with 
the unsponsored ceasefire that took effect aug 20 
to my knowledge the un secretary general has understood our 
position and is sympathizing with it aziz said there was no 
immediate word from perez de cueller 
aziz added that iraq is prepared to stay in geneva to continue 
the negotiations as long as the mission requires 
a statement made in baghdad by iraqs deputy foreign minister 
saadoun hamadi threw doubt on the possibility of progress 
hamadi reiterated iraqs claim to full sovereignty over the 
shattalarab a 1975 treaty placed the iraniraq border down the 
middle of the waterway formed by the common estuary of the tigris 
and euphrates rivers 
iraq repudiated the treaty in september 1980 shortly before 
sending its army across the border to set off the war more than 1 
million were killed or injured in the war 
any attempt to minimize the full sovereignty of iraq on this 
vital lane would be faced with categorical rejection from our 
side hamadi said he also warned that iran will face from our 
side full preparedness to confront any behavior of aggressive 
aspect 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati rejected iraqs 
claim to the entire waterway he told reporters sunday night that 
the 1975 treaty had been accepted by both sides and could not be 
abrogated unilaterally by iraq 
president ali khamenei of iran had declared in tehran earlier 
that any attempt to renegotiate the border would prolong the peace 
talks for years 
velayati said his side had accepted the plan proposed by the 
secretarygeneral calling for a ceasefire to be followed by a 
troop withdrawal 
we support these procedures but now everybody knows that iraq 
is trying to make obstacles in the way of full implementation of 
the un ceasefire resolution by raising some preconditions 
iran accepted the un resolution in july iraq accepted the 
plan shortly after the security council passed it in july 1987

of a neighbor against whom he allegedly harbored a grudge for 14 
years authorities said 
robert mclaughlin 47 an 18year hampton police veteran is 
being held without bail on a charge of firstdegree murder in the 
june 1 killing of robert cushing 63 a prominent real estate 
broker 
until he surrendered to state police mclaughlin had not been a 
suspect in the killing the attorney generals office said 
mclaughlin remained in stable condition today at portsmouth 
hospital where he was taken after he surrendered friday 
authorities said he was suffering from high blood pressure 
mclaughlin was arraigned saturday at the hospital 
hampton police chief robert mark in a telephone interview 
saturday described mclaughlin as a model policeman he had a 
very good record 
the boston sunday globe quoted mark as saying that mclaughlin 
once arrested cushing on a minor charge when cushing reportedly 
tried to prevent police from taking pictures of two teenagers who 
died in a traffic accident near his home however on sunday mark 
denied making those comments 
todays editions of the union leader of manchester quoted two 
neighbors who gave two other possible explanations of what prompted 
the grudge both stemming from longago confrontations between 
cushing and mclaughlin 
assistant attorney general barbara keshen said only that 
mclaughlin made a misdemeanor arrest 14 years ago and cushing 
became involved indirectly 
since then mclaughlin harbored illwill feelings against mr 
cushing that seem to have come to a head on the evening of june 1 
where he admitted that he took his shotgun loaded it went over to 
the cushing residence and shot mr cushing keshen said at a news 
conference saturday cushing who was shot as he answered his front 
door died of gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen 
keshen said the state would seek a firstdegree murder 
indictment against mclaughlin the offense carries an automatic 
sentence of life in prison without parole 
the shotgun used in the killing has not been recovered she said 
cushings family criticized local officials handling of the 
case 
the family said in a statement sunday that it was 
unfortunate that officials gave incomplete and inaccurate 
information about an incident 14 years ago and have characterized a 
confessed murderer as a model police officer 
a son of the victim kevin cushing declined to explain what may 
have sparked the grudge saying the attorney generals office has 
asked the family not to comment

demand a return to democratic rule went back to their offices to 
collect august paychecks but then returned home 
official rangoon radio said police opened fire sunday on about 
80 demonstrators who attacked a police station in minhala about 
250 miles northwest of rangoon killing six people and wounding 
four 
the incident began as a counterprotest to a demonstration the 
day before by about 400 people the radio said it did not say what 
the original demonstration was about 
the radio also said today that two prisoners died during a riot 
saturday in the central jail of mandalay burmas second largest 
city about 400 miles north of rangoon it said inmates armed with 
sticks destroyed their cells and ignored warnings broadcast on 
loudspeakers that guards would open fire if the riot continued 
shots were fired to control the situation the report said 
the radio said inmates at the htonbo prison camp near mandalay 
rioted shortly after midnight friday and set fire to the camp

whose government was toppled by the 1962 military coup led by ne 
win that ushered in oneparty rule 
burmese sources said the new committee was not likely to have 
great political significance and its formation did not appear to be 
linked to demands by many burmese for an interim government to lead 
the nation to democracy 
the rangoon bar council denounced the government today for 
waiting for a popular referendum to abolish oneparty rule 
the whole country has already rejected the oneparty system by 
the demonstrations and procrastination by referendum would 
only deepen the fastdeteriorating situation in the country the 
council said the bar council therefore demands the government 
form an interim government to carry on the process of 
democratization in the country 
the turmoil in this isolated southeast asian nation began july 
23 when 77yearold ne win resigned after 26 years of authoritarian 
rule the ruling burma socialist program party chose hardliner sein 
lwin to succeed him 
mass studentled demonstrations followed leading to the 
resignation of sein lwin and his replacement aug 19 by civilian 
lawyer maung maung the rallies since have been peaceful

former olympic diver bruce kimball pleaded 
innocent today to alcoholrelated manslaughter charges in a traffic 
accident that killed two teenagers and injured six others 
the 1984 silver medalist stood silently hands clasped behind 
his back as attorney frank quesada entered the plea before 
hillsborough circuit judge harry lee coe 
kimball 24 is accused of driving the car that slammed into a 
group of teenagers the night of aug 1 at a popular roadside 
hangout called the spot witnesses told police the car was 
speeding up to 70 mph 
he is charged with two counts of drunkendriving manslaughter 
and three counts of drunkendriving in an accident with serious 
injury if convicted he could face as much as 45 years in prison 
coe set a tentative trial date of nov 14 and allowed the diver 
to remain free on 10000 bond with no travel restrictions he 
said he was satisfied that kimball posed no risk of flight because 
he was present in the courtroom today 
kimball agreed not to drive a car when the judge suggested that 
as a condition of bond codefense counsel lee fugate said it would 
not be a problem because kimball would be attending school and 
working part time at his fathers diving school and could get 
around by walking 
the judge also said the highprofile case had drawn so much 
publicity that the whole country in a sense is watching him 
kimball competed for a spot on this years olympic team after 
the accident but failed to make the squad

earlier this month was a group of florida residents protesting his 
efforts to go to korea for the summer games because of the deaths

prosecutors have refused to release results of kimballs 
bloodalcohol tests from the nighttime accident in the tampa suburb 
of brandon authorities have said it was over the level of 010 
which is enough to make a motorist legally drunk in florida 
coe instructed attorneys to notify witnesses that they would not 
be allowed to publicly discuss the case the judge cited concerns 
for prospective jurors if the case goes to trial

the environmental protection agency announced 
plans today to ban major new sources of air pollution in the 
nations most populous urban area greater los angeles 
epa administrator lee m thomas said similar action is planned 
against at least three other cities by the end of this year unless 
congress revises the clean air act 
california officials have said they expect little effect from 
the los angeles ban which goes into effect tuesday because it 
covers only large new plants that no one is planning to build in 
the area such as oil refineries 
a stopgap congressional ban on agency sanctions expires at 
midnight tuesday eight months after it was imposed to buy time for 
congress to produce changes in the law 
the construction ban against sources of 100 tons of pollution a 
year is imposed for failure to submit adequate air pollution 
control plans showing compliance with federal pollution standards 
all areas were supposed to have met those standards by dec 31 
1987 epa maintains the law permits penalties only for failure to 
submit and follow plans there is no penalty for failure to meet 
the standards if an agencyapproved control plan did not work out 
there have been several proposals to extend the compliance 
deadline but in the absence of congressional action epa has said 
it intends to require new pollution control plans from the states 
that will have to show steady reductions in pollution 
concentrations 
there has been no agreement in congress on what should be done 
about the missed deadlines and when congress reconvenes next month 
it will have only about a month left in this years session 
los angeles is one of about 100 cities counties and 
metropolitan areas that the epa says missed last decembers 
deadline to meet healthprotecting standards restricting levels of 
carbon monoxide and ozone a major component of smog 
ozone not only causes respiratory problems for humans but in 
high concentrations can injure animals and damage crops forests 
and even building materials according to epa 
it is formed in sunlight by a complex chemical reaction 
involving volatile organic compounds such as gasoline and emissions 
of nitrogen oxides from transportation and industrial sources 
ozone pollution frequently is worsened by the type of hot dry 
weather much of the nation has experienced this summer 
under the clean air act an area formally cited by epa for 
failing to meet the standards is subject to an automatic ban on 
construction of new facilities that would emit more than 100 tons a 
year of ozone or carbon monoxide 
before the moratorium was imposed such bans were imposed on st 
cloud minn albuquerque nm the kentucky suburbs of cincinnati 
and various parts of illinois 
the law provides for other penalties such as a cutoff of federal 
aid for airpollution control programs and highway construction 
albuquerque was hit with these sanctions although epa has proposed 
lifting them 
epa officials say los angeles which lacks an agencyapproved 
plan to clean up its air pollution is just the first of a number 
of cities that will face construction bans with the expiration of 
the moratorium 
they said that by late october bans could be imposed against 
ventura county calif chicago and the northwestern indiana area 
adjacent to chicago 
waiting in the wings are 10 more whose airquality attainment 
plans are on the verge of being formally rejected by epa an action 
that would trigger construction bans 
they are denver atlanta dallas cleveland sacramento calif 
reno nev bakersfield calif east st louis ill fresno 
calif and indiana counties adjacent to louisville ky 
epa officials have indicated that dallas may be scrubbed from 
the sanctions list because of improvements made to its cleanup plan 
they say there are no immediate plans to bring sanctions against 
the other cities and areas among the 100 or so that have approved 
airquality plans but still failed to meet the standards by last 
years compliance deadline 
in those cases the agency appears to be waiting to see what 
congress does 
under proposals on both sides of capitol hill the clean air act 
would be rewritten to grant more time to curb air pollution but 
require areas with severe stubborn problems to take tough 
abatement steps such as limiting vehicle entry to cities 
advocates of a strong new law also are pushing for increased 
controls on vehicular emissions which isnt a popular idea with 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the energy and commerce 
committee 
that panel is still trying to get a consensus on legislation 
through closeddoor negotiations principally between dingell and 
rep henry waxman dcalif who comes from los angeles and wants a 
stronger law 
committee sources insisting on anonymity say that after months 
of sometimes angry confrontations dingell and waxman several weeks 
ago finally got down to business and began serious bargaining 
they say however that the two lawmakers havent even touched 
the acid rain issue which is far more complex politically and 
geographically because the east wants the midwest to clean up its 
smokestacks and the west and south arent excited about helping to 
pay for the expensive job 
on the senate side the environment committee has produced 
legislation that has been ready for the floor for a year but hasnt 
been able to get floor time principally because of opposition from 
majority leader robert byrd dwva 
the bills acid rain provisions are a double whammy for byrd 
his state has a number of coalburning power plants that would have 
to clean up emissions and west virginias huge reserves of 
highsulfur coal could be

navy officials expressed concerns about 
pressure to graduate more students at a rescueswimmer school just 
two months before the death of a recruit a witness testified today 
in an officers courtmartial 
our feelings were we were going to be getting initially less 
qualified individuals said chief petty officer john w singer 
the former topranking enlisted man at the navy rescue swimmer 
school at pensacola naval air station 
the testimony came during the derelictionofduty trial of lt 
thomas a torchia former officer in charge of the school on march 
2 when airman recruit lee mirecki 19 of appleton wis died 
during a training exercise 
mirecki died from a fearinduced heart attack or drowning after 
several instructors forced him into a swimming pool when he tried 
to quit the voluntary program one of them is accused of holding 
mireckis head under water 
prosecutors contend any use of force to compel students to 
complete training exercises is illegal 
singer said he torchia and others were concerned about the 
quality of recruits as a result of pressure from higher authorities 
to accept and graduate more students because of a shortage of 
rescue swimmers 
but he said torchias boss agreed no changes should be made to 
make the course less rigorous however after mireckis death the 
navy prohibited instructors from touching students 
torchias lawyers are trying to show force was necessary for 
realistic training and that the notouching rule has produced 
inadequately prepared rescue swimmers who will be a danger to 
themselves and others 
cmdr dennis hathaway director of the related navy aircrew 
school testified saturday that he was concerned about the quality 
of new rescueswimmer graduates who have practiced lifesaving 
techniques only on other students rather than instructors 
students are easier on each other than instructors were 
hathaway said 
rescue swimmers jump out of helicopters to go to the aid of 
downed aviators sometimes in heavy seas and at night 
a navy spokesman lt cmdr dennis hessler has defended the new 
curriculum and rules saying it was approved by training officers 
as well as rescue experts who work in the fleet 
torchia 32 of princeton ill is accused of neglecting to 
adopt policies to prohibit instructors from physically forcing 
mirecki into the pool after he had climbed out and shouted 
dor which stands for drop on request the term for 
quitting the school 
he also is accused of failing to intercede at the scene to stop 
the use of force torchia was talking on the telephone in his 
office overlooking the pool at the time but claims he saw and 
heard nothing to indicate force was being used on the recruit

democratic nominee michael dukakis said today the fall campaign 
against george bush will be a long hard competitive race 
while aides to the republican nominee said the vice president will 
continue to paint his rival as weak on defense 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle meanwhile 
said he has not discussed the drug issue with bush although the gop 
nominee has said that his vice president would oversee federal drug 
policy in a possible bush administration 
the indiana senator in an interview with the boston globe 
published in todays editions also said he was familiar in a 
general sense with the national narcotics border interdiction 
system but did not know who headed the system 
bush has led the system since its creation in 1983 
the democratic vice presidential nominee texas sen lloyd 
bentsen continued to cast doubts on quayles experience 
frankly he would not have been on my short list as i look 
over my senate colleagues bentsen said sunday when asked about 
quayle on nbcs meet the press he obviously was on the short 
list of the hard right 
now i wouldnt say that he couldnt grow into the job he 
probably could but if a tragedy befell a president youd have to 
be able to move in immediately and take over and do what has to be 
done in facing whatever issues that confront you at that time 
democratic nominee dukakis kicked off a twoday visit to the 
western section of his home state massachusetts where he sought 
to halt the recent surge of his republican opponent 
its going to be a long hard competitive race dukakis told 
a breakfast sponsored by the northern berkshire chamber of 
commerce one thing that inspires me every day and every week out 
there on the campaign trail is that i know we can do it 
together because ive seen it happen 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller said the vice president 
will continue to stress his promilitary views in the coming week 
and portray dukakis as weak on defense the gop nominees campaign 
believes that theme is going over well 
bush was traveling today from houston to st louis where he 
planned a tour of an aerospace plant and then to nashville for a 
rally and visit to the reserve officer training program at middle 
tennessee state university 
he returns to washington tonight for a series of day campaign 
trips to various states and may head west to california and 
colorado on the weekend 
the vice presidential candidates planned some time off from the 
campaign trail but used weekend appearances to criticize their 
opponents 
bentsen in suggesting that quayle could not step right up to 
presidency was continuing a line of attack that was clear last 
week show that the 41yearold indiana senator lacked the depth 
and experience for the job that is only a heartbeat away for any 
vice president 
quayle declined to criticize his 67yearold colleague in the 
senate saying that his gripe is with democratic presidential 
nominee michael dukakis in last weeks sevenstate campaign 
quayles only mention of bentsen was to praise his views on defense 
spending and other issues where he stands to the right of dukakis 
ive served with sen bentsen for almost eight years he is 
not the issue quayle said sunday in an interview with the 
associated press the issue is michael dukakis michael dukakis 
view of america is a much different view than george bushs 
michael dukakis approach to national defense his approach to the 
economy his approach to child care all of those approaches are 
much different than george bushs 
quayle said doubts about his qualifications are nothing that a 
good debate wouldnt cure 
the american people are just beginning to see dan quayle he 
said im going to continue to talk about the issues when we 
have the debate between lloyd bentsen and dan quayle the american 
people will have a lot better picture of who will be the best 
qualified vice presidential candidate 
quayle traveled to the midwest and west last week and will 
leave again wednesday for a swing through the southeast that will 
take him through to labor day 
former presidential candidate jesse jackson interviewed on 
abcs this week with david brinkley said meanwhile that the 
dukakis campaign can become too preoccupied with trying win back 
conservative democrats who have been voting for ronald reagan 
i thould think the democrats strength is not between the 
45yard lines with this obsession to recall the reagan democrats 
who are with quayle under the bush he said 
he said that more could be accomplished by massive registration 
of new voters and reaching out to the working and nonworking poor

an attorney for a smalltown mayor who 
donned a turban and rubber snakes to proclaim national voodoo 
week said the states impeachment trial of the mayor is like 
shooting his casket 
jury selection began today in covington county circuit court in 
the trial for florala mayor ht mathis 85 unless the case is 
delayed on a motion by mathis attorney 
attorney general don siegelman and a county grand jury accused 
mathis of misusing his office by granting too many pardons for 
drunken drivers 
the mayor also is accused of willful neglect of duty 
incompetency in office and corruption presiding over the trial is 
circuit judge billy baldwin in andalusia 
mathis attorney james prestwood of andalusia said the trial 
is moot with the mayors fouryear term ending oct 3 prestwood 
has filed a motion asking baldwin to delay it 
its almost like waiting for his funeral and shooting his 
casket prestwood said 
the florala city council has chastised the mayor for his 
performance in office including spending city funds without proper 
city council approval 
and last month the mayor sprinkled voodoo dust around city 
hall to drive out the evil spirits later describing the 
incident as a joke that got out of hand but he topped that by 
declaring national voodoo week in the south alabama town 
reviving the publicity over the joke 
mathis said if the trial starts this week he will be ready to 
tell the truth just like i always have 
ive had people all over the state call to wish me luck he 
said i believe the lord will see me through this 
assistant attorney general david christy said those found guilty 
of impeachment charges are only removed from office they are not 
fined or sent to jail though they can face another trial for the 
same crimes impeachment trials are civil proceedings that are 
quasicriminal in that they are conducted much like criminal trials 
in alabama an official thrown out of office can appeal directly 
to the state supreme court 
the last impeachment in alabama was of former choctaw county 
clerk elizabeth lewis who was removed from office in 1979 in 
1980 the alabama supreme court affirmed the lewis conviction in a 
landmark state case

plotting to overthrow president yoweri musevenis government the 
killing took place at the kampala home of henry gombya a

the disaster at the ramstein air base in west 
germany casts a shadow over the air shows that are among europes 
favorite spectator sports as well as being the major marketplaces 
of the international aerospace industry 
but while germany has suspended military air exhibitions and 
some calls are being heard for other european countries to do 
likewise the shows look likely to go on 
sundays tragedy at the us air force base at ramstein came a 
week before europes biggest aviation event englands farnborough 
air show and although farnborough hasnt experienced an accident 
involving spectators since 1952 the ramstein disaster immediately 
prompted thoughts about safety at the show 
in britain ken collins a labor party member of the european 
parliament wrote to prime minister margaret thatcher on monday 
urging that farnborough be canceled because we cannot afford to 
take any more needless risks with human life 
organizers said the show would go on but spokesman duncan 
simpson a former test pilot said no one would deny that after 
an accident like that we all have to think very hard 
however he said the safety rules already were so strict that 
there was little scope for major change 
pilots at farnborough have to perform their display for a 
committee of experts before the show opens they cannot fly over or 
toward the spectators they must maintain a minimum altitude of 100 
feet and must keep to the side of the runway farthest from the 
grandstands 
i would never say an incident will never happen simpson 
said in an interview they do happen occasionally what we are 
concerned with is ensuring that in the likelihood of an accident 
the catastrophic consequences should be reduced to an absolute 
minimum 
paul beaver managing editor of janes defense data the 
authoritative military publishing concern reckons that air shows 
statistically are 10 times safer than highways 
youre much less likely to be hurt at an air show than driving 
to it he said in an interview 
farnborough alternates with le bourget in paris at holding the 
annual show one of the worlds leading showcases for new aircraft 
the highlight among the 160 aircraft from more than 30 countries 
at this years 10day show is the mig29 it is the first advanced 
soviet warplane to go on public display in the west 
simpson said it was impossible to quantify the amount of money 
involved in deals struck at farnborough or le bourget but believed 
the total regularly runs into billions of dollars 
the trade shows attract around 150000 visitors but are geared 
mostly for buyers and sellers the public is less important you 
have to have them but its not that that counts said patrick 
guerin a french aerospace industry spokesman 
shows like the one at ramstein by contrast are geared strictly 
for the public serving as showcases for air forces to show off 
their prowess 
the public want them they flock in large numbers its just 
like motor racing or rally driving its a fact of life said 
simpson 
for air forces aerobatics teams like britains red arrows 
provide valuable training and serve a public relations role 
frequently performing abroad as ambassadors for their country he 
said 
the red arrows team has suffered a series of accidents in recent 
years these have never harmed spectators but after the ramstein 
accident the daily telegraph editorialized the time has arrived 
to consider whether exhibitionism in the air and large static 
crowds can coexist and if they can what measures could reduce 
the risk of further disaster 
while some italian newspapers called for an end to public shows 
the italian defense ministry announced that its team will stick to 
its 1988 schedule of performances but at a reduced level 
beaver doubted ramstein would put a damper on british aerobatics 
shows half the thrill is to see the planes as close as one can 
the noise and atmosphere of being there he said

the chief of south koreas army 
intelligence was fired monday in connection with an alleged attack 
this month on a journalist military officials said 
maj gen lee jinbaek who headed the army intelligence 
command had been questioned to determine whether he instigated an 
aug 7 attack of oh hongkun city editor of the joongang economic 
news the military said 
a major and three noncommissioned officers of the intelligence 
command have been arrested on charges of slashing ohs thigh with 
knives the four admitted attacking oh in retaliation for articles

punishment of all officers linked to the case

were found to have been involved in either the attack or in a 
suspected coverup military authorities said charges against the 
two were under consideration 
opposition leaders charged the attack demonstrated a hawkish 
trend in the govenment and indicates hardliners want to crack down 
on political dissent they contend other military officers were 
involved in the attack 
the military originally denied any soldiers were involved under 
intense opposition criticism however the government ordered the 
military investigation 
opposition leader kim youngsam urged president roh taewoo to 
take stern action against any officers found to be involved in the 
attack aides to kim said

at the same time the proportion of workers without a high 
school diploma has declined from 24 percent in 1978 to 15 percent 
today the bureau said the share of the work force ending their 
formal education at the completion of high school remains unchanged

percent and 9 percent respectively a decade ago 
meanwhile the percentage of high school dropouts has fallen 
from 40 percent to 23 percent for blacks from 52 percent to 40 
percent among hispanics and from 14 percent to 8 percent among 
whites

workers with the most education incur the least unemployment 
the jobless rate for college graduates was just 17 percent 
compared with unemployment rates of 37 percent for workers with 
one to three years of college 54 percent for high school 
gradutates and 94 percent for high school dropouts 
at an alltime low 33 percent the unemployment rate for black 
college graduates however was still more than twice the 15 
percent rate among white college graduates 
while the proportion of workingage men in the labor force 
dropped slightly from 898 percent in 1978 to 886 percent this 
year it increased dramatically for women 
two of every three women of working age now hold jobs or are 
actively seeking them compared with 561 percent a decade ago the 
most dramatic gains according the labor department have been 
among women college graduates up from 708 percent in 1978 to 806 
percent this year and those with one to three years of college up 
from 619 percent to 747 percent

the mayor of the us seventh fleets home port and 
the prefectural governor lodged official protests monday over the 
planned arrival of two us warships capable of carrying nuclear 
weapons 
civic groups have announced plans to protest the arrival 
wednesday of the two ships which will be stationed with the us 
seventh fleet at yokosuka to replace two frigates 
yokosuka mayor kazuo yokoyama and kanagawa gov kazuji nagasu 
demanded to know whether the ticonderogaclass guided missile 
cruiser bunker hill and the destroyer fife will be carrying 
tomahawk nuclear missiles when they enter yokosuka 
they delivered their protests in visits with foreign minister 
sosuke uno and urged the government to uphold its constitutional 
stance against manufacturing possessing or allowing into japanese 
territory any nuclear weapons officials said 
it goes without saying that this issue has brought great 
unease to the citizens of yokosuka and strongly threatens the 
safety of life yokoyama was quoted as telling uno 
the two leaders criticized the system that will allow the two 
warships to enter yokosuka their spokesmen said 
both ships are capable of deploying tomahawk nuclear and 
nonnuclear missiles under a bilateral agreement the united 
states must notify japan beforehand if it plans to bring nuclear 
weapons into the country 
since there has been no prior consultation the government 
considers that there is no doubt nuclear weapons will not be 
introduced a foreign ministry official quoted uno as telling 
yokoyama 
nagasu also delivered his message to us ambassador mike 
mansfield along with a petition against the warships arrival that 
contained almost 100000 signatures 
the existing system of prior consultation has not been enough 
to dispel public unease nagasu said it is extremely 
regrettable that the two ships will enter yokosuka port 
the us military has maintained a policy of neither publicly 
confirming nor denying the existence of nuclear weapons aboard its 
ships

the nation apparently wasnt all our forefathers 
fathered revolutionary warera records show that sex was part of 
serious courtship and often resulted in premarital pregnancy a 
historian writes 
americans in the late 1700s were more licentious than we 
imagine them to be jack larkin writes in american heritage 
magazines septemberoctober issue 
larkin cites birth and marriage records of several dozen 
american communities to prove that in the late 18th century 
pregnancy was frequently a prelude to marriage in rural new 
england nearly a third of brides were already with child 
the frequency of sexual intercourse before marriage was surely 
higher since some couples would have escaped early pregnancy for 
many couples sexual relations were part of serious courtship he 
wrote 
people today tend to assume weve reached the ultimate level 
of moral looseness and that you can look back through our history 
at a steadily rising level of immorality building up to the 
present larkin said in an interview but in fact these things 
have gone in cycles 
the concept of randy revolutionaries is particularly surprising 
in straitlaced new england considering the popular notion of 
what puritanism was all about larkin said 
seventeenthcentury new england was indeed a strict society but 
sexual freedom began to increase as the region became more socially 
and economically diverse and as resistance to british rule spread 
throughout the colonies in the late 1700s all hell broke 
loose he said 
lest anyone confuse salem with sodom or gloucester with 
gomorrah however larkin offers this caveat pregnancies usually 
simply accelerated a marriage that would have taken place in any 
case most rural communities simply accepted the early 
pregnancies that marked so many marriages 
larkin is chief historian at old sturbridge village in 
sturbridge mass a recreation of an 18thcentury village this 
fall harper amp row will publish his book the reshaping of 
everyday life in the united states 17901840 
when early american communities did censure premarital 
pregnancy it often was more a matter of economics than morals the 
rule as enunciated by asa lincoln justice of the peace in 
brimfield mass was born a bastard and chargeable to the 
town 
accordingly if a woman were still unmarried by the time she 
gave birth officials might interrogate her during labor about the 
fathers identity not as much to condemn him for immorality as to 
get him to support his child 
sexual mores began to change in the 1820s larkin says as the 
turbulent war years receded and society became more settled and 
more strict 
community records in this period show that the proportion of 
women who conceived a child before marriage steadily declined by 
1840 the premarital pregnancy rate in new england towns dropped 
from nearly one pregnant bride in three to one in five or six in 
some places prenuptial pregnancy dropped to 5 percent 
for many americans this marked the acceptance of new limits on 
sexual behavior imposed not by their parents or other authorities 
but by themselves larkin writes 
they were marrying later than their parents often living 
through long engagements while the husbandtobe strove to 
establish his place in the world they chose not to risk a 
pregnancy that would precipitate them into an early marriage 
such points larkin said are hard to make at a family place 
like old sturbridge village 
thats why i wrote the book he explained some things are 
hard to show in a museum

newhome sales suffered their steepest drop in 
seven months in july the government said monday and economists 
predicted further softening as rising mortgage interest rates push 
up the cost of buying a home 
sales of new singlefamily homes fell 47 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 686000 units last month 
according to a joint report of the departments of commerce and 
housing and urban development 
the government also revised estimates for june and may downward 
showing less housing strength than previously believed 
fixedrate mortgages have risen by almost a point since march to 
their highest levels of the year boosting the monthly payment on a 
new 100000 mortgage by about 65 
and a halfpoint boost earlier this month in federal reserves 
key bank lending rate doesnt bode very well for the coming 
months said thomas m holloway senior economist at the mortgage 
bankers association of america he predicted another halfpoint or 
so increase in mortgage rates by the end of the year 
that should be considered quite discouraging holloway said 
however other economists noted that even though newhome sales 
in july took their sharpest tumble since a 62 percent drop in 
december they were still strong the decrease in july followed a 
67 percent increase in june which buoyed sales to the highest 
level since april 1987 
economists attributed the june upturn in part to attempts by 
buyers to close deals before interest rates went higher 
the june number was unusually high so im certainly pleased 
by the july number said mark obrinsky an economist with the 
us league of savings institutions if interest rates continue 
to go up then well certainly see some decrease in sales activity 
but overall its not looking too bad 
rate increases have been gradual enough not to add any 
psychological fuel to the fire obrinsky said the rates are 
still relatively affordable and they are still lower than they were 
last fall 
for the first seven months of the year new home sales were 30 
percent lower than in the same period a year earlier 
the july drop in new home sales was in line with other housing 
indicators for the month construction starts of singlefamily 
homes fell 08 percent and sales of existing homes were off by 50 
percent 
meanwhile the price of new homes was up sharply in july even 
though sales fell the median price of a new home rose to 123500 
56 percent above the june median price of 117000 meaning half 
the homes sold in those months cost more and half less 
the average price of a home was up as well climbing 71 percent 
to 146000 
according to michael sumichrast a washingtonbased economist 
and publisher of a construction newsletter blamed the price 
increases rather than interest rates for declining sales last month 
prices just cannot continue at these levels they just 
went totally crazy and its finally catching up particularly 
in new jersey and new york he said 
by region sales in july were down most steeply in the 
northeast where they fell 184 percent to an annual rate of 
93000 the midwest posted a 55 percent decline to a rate of 
86000 and sales in the south fell 49 percent to a rate of 
270000 sales in the west were up 26 percent to a rate of 237000 
sumichrast predicted declining sales in all four regions next 
year he said the drop would be most moderate in the south and 
midwest and steepest in the west and northeast where prices are 
highest

the cover picture of the snowcapped 
rocky mountain front could be from any mountain guidebook but the 
missile silo in the foreground is the tipoff that nuclear 
heartland is not ordinary 
the 96page paperback which sells for 1250 was put together 
by peace activists who say it is the first complete series of 
detailed maps showing where 1000 minuteman missile silos and their 
launch control centers are located in montana wyoming colorado 
missouri and the dakotas 
the idea is to make people in those states aware of the unseen 
weapons said editor sam day and to encourage people to 
approach them and contemplate their meaning 
included are 200 missile silos in the malmstrom air force base 
range about 12 percent of montana 
capt don planalp malmstrom public affairs officer said the 
air force has no objection to the maps its no secret where the 
missiles are he said we can assume our enemies know where 
they are 
planalp also said people are free to look at missile silos from 
adjoining property but not from in the federal property line 25 
feet outside the fences surrounding the silos 
when people stand near a missile and think about its destructive 
force and about the force of the soviet missiles aimed at them it 
can spur them to help end the arms race day said 
the book published by the progressive foundation of madison 
wis pinpoints the missiles on maps with short descriptions of 
how to get to each one while the guidebook lists missiles by their 
official air force name it also calls them by the nicknames given 
them by the local volunteers who doublechecked the locations 
some missiles were named for peace activists including marks 
missile after mark anderlik of missoula mont who coordinated 
the montana mapmaking effort 
the veteran nuclear protester says it is amazing how many people 
do not know how many missiles are in their state and even more 
amazing that many people live right next to missiles without 
realizing it 
with 200 missiles to nickname in montana alone the volunteers 
displayed a combination of humor moral indignation and cynicism 
humorous names include the we dont think about it and harmful 
if swallowed missiles names describing the effects of nuclear war 
include burning bodies radiation sickness and living hell 
missiles political names include bipartisan and money is no 
object missiles named jesus wept shameless swaggering 
compassions mortuary and murder suicide reflect moral outrage 
like more orthodox travel guides the book also pointed out 
sites its authors thought were of particular note in each state 
montanas noteworthy points include the first activated 
launchcontrol facility which president kennedy used as his ace 
in the hole during the cuban missile crisis a silo alleged to be 
inhabited by an indian spirit and silos near where peace camps and 
demonstration arrests have been made

a doctor who will make a 
house call on two cosmonauts headed monday for a rendezvous with 
their mir space station accompanied by the first afghan in orbit 
and a veteran of the soviet space endurance program 
a rocket carrying the soyuztm 6 capsule blasted off at 823 
am moscow time 1223 am edt monday and reached orbit about 
nine minutes later 
aboard the soyuz spacecraft are dr valery polyakov afghan air 
force pilot abdul ahad mohmand who helped battle moslem guerrillas 
in his homeland and veteran cosmonaut vladimir lyakhov 
they will dock wednesday with the orbiting mir space station 
where cosmonauts vladimir titov and musa manarov are in the midst 
of a spaceendurance mission that is to break the 326day record 
on dec 21 titov 40 and manarov 37 will have been in space one 
year 
mohmand and lyakhov will return to earth after eight days but 
polyakov 46 will stay aboard the station to monitor the health of 
titov and manarov 
there is no indication titov and manarov have suffered any 
health problems and polyakov apparently just wants to study them 
to learn more about the effects of longterm space travel 
in addition to the house call polyakov is serving as a guinea 
pig on the mission 
polyakov a specialist in the effects of weightlessness on the 
human body underwent a painful and risky operation before the 
flight to remove some bone marrow from his body the official news 
agency tass reported marrow will also be removed after he returns 
to earth and the samples will be compared tass said 
prolonged spaceflight weakens bones and scientists are trying 
to determine how to counteract the depletion the soviet manned 
space program more than the american program is geared toward 
long flights in preparation for a mission to mars which would take 
three years 
tass said polyakov will also study motion sickness another 
troublesome problem of spaceflight 
baikonur spokesman alexander savokhkon said of the liftoff of 
the threestage rocket and soyuz capsule went totally according 
to program just a normal launch it was shown live on soviet and 
afghan television 
mohmand 29 is to take part in efforts to identify oil gas and 
other mineral deposits in afghanistan and to predict runoff of snow 
and ice to alleviate a water shortage he will also use instruments 
to try to identify where earthquakes might occur in afghanistan 
the flight also has major political significance 
it comes during the soviet troop withdrawal from afghanistan 
and is an ideal way for the kremlin to reassure its ally of 
continued support and friendship and boost the prestige of 
afghanistans prosoviet government 
the government of president najib is locked in a long war with 
antimarxist insurgents and increasingly is being left to fight on 
its own as the 100000 soviet soldiers withdraw the soviet union 
withdrew half the force between may 15aug 15 and the remainder 
of the force must be withdrawn by feb 15 1989 
being a son of my proud people i will carry along not only joy 
but also sorrow for my homeland gripped by a fratricidal war 
mohmand said in a statement broadcast live from the capsule before 
liftoff 
brothers stop the war and direct your forces toward building 
a durable national peace said mohmand who flew 500 combat 
missions against the rebels 
najib in a statement carried by tass announced that his 
countrys armed forces would observe a ceasefire during the space 
mission he said the forces will fire only in selfdefense and 
appealed to the rebels to follow suit 
lyakhov the 47yearold pilot is making his third space 
flight he was in space for 175 days in 1979 and a member of a 
150day mission in 1983 
the three cosmonauts dressed in their white space suits 
answered questions of foreign journalists briefly before the 
flight an animated lyakhov answered questions in several languages 
before saying goodbye in english 
a soviet photographer was caught trying to sneak onto the bus 
taking the cosmonauts to the yuri gagarin launch pad and was 
ordered off

the energy department said monday it has given 
final approval to an agreement with texaco corp calling for 125 
billion in payments to the government over 5 years to settle 
accusations of overcharging for pricecontrolled crude oil 
the settlement details of which were announced in february is 
the second largest in the governments long campaign to recover 
overcharges in the years from 1973 to 1981 when crude oil was 
subject to price controls 
only 21 billion paid by exxon corp was larger with the 
texaco payment the government will have recovered more than 7 
billion 
the government originally sought 21 billion from texaco on 
similar grounds that like exxon texaco had pumped oil from old 
wellls under price controls and sold it at a higher price from 
newly drilled wells exempt from controls 
texaco will pay the government 400 million within 30 days 190 
million plus interest within 18 months and four annual payments 
after that of 165 million plus interest details of the interest 
calculation were not given 
the department said about 120 million would be refunded to 
buyers of texacos refined products 20 percent of the rest would 
be set aside for future claims and the rest split between the 
federal government and the states 
texaco has said it already has set aside funds to pay the 
government and will not have to charge the payments against 
earnings

trustees of the county hospital had to 
declare cocacola a unique product to resolve a minor crisis after 
patients refused substitutes and kept doctors busy writing 
prescriptions for the soft drink 
the trustees action last week was the only way around the 
county requirement to buy on a strict lowbid system the 
distributor who won the cola contract doesnt carry coke 
before the vote patients had a choice of diet pepsi 
mississippi cola and faygo cola 
the demand for coke began with breakfast for some folks its 
the first thing they have in the morning said hinds general 
hospital nursing director rita wray for some folks its their 
coffee for others its that coke 
wray said some patients insist cocacola is better than 
medication for nausea 
for some reason if you give them any other carbonated 
beverage whether its in their minds or in the formulation 
somehow it just doesnt do the trick wray said 
i thought it was a little bit silly but i did it anyway 
because i want my patients to be happy said dr gerry ann 
houston 
wray said that was the reaction of most staff physicians they 
think whatever the patient wants and will make him feel better 
well do itraq treaty which sets 
the border down the middle of the 120mile shattalarab formed by 
the confluence of the euphrates and tigris rivers 
iraq which claims sovereignty over the waterway says the 
treaty has lapsed because of alleged iranian violations 
iran has said a treaty cannot be renounced by one side only and 
has charged iraq by undermining the talks with its stance 
resolution of the issue seems key to agreement on a troop 
withdrawal to international borders one of the points listed in a 
july 20 1987 un ceasefire resolution that forms the basis of 
the current peace talks

reaffirmed his countrys claim in a toughly worded statement that 
cast doubt on progress at the talks 
aziz was also asked to respond to accusations monday by massoud 
barzani a leader of iraqi kurdish guerrillas that iraqi forces 
have injured and killed kurdish refugees in daily chemical bomb 
attacks this month 
i prefer not to comment on that he said that is a matter 
of the past and i like to concentrate on the future

using medicaid computer data to identify 
pharmacies selling unusual amounts of controlled substances could 
help investigators in the battle against illicit drugs according 
to a congressional report 
its an astoundingly simple concept despite the complexity of 
the computer system said rep charles rangel dny who 
released the general accounting office study late monday locate 
the drugstores selling the highest percentage of controlled 
substances to medicaid patients and you might also be finding the 
crooked drugstores and the doctors purposely making illegal 
prescriptions 
aside from drugs such as heroin which are unlawful under any 
circumstances controlled substances include many other drugs which 
be legally prescribed but pose various risks of physical or 
psychological harm through abuse morphine methadone cocaine 
aspirin with codeine phenobarbital valium and darvon are among 
examples 
except in small states medicaid agencies are required to have a 
medicaid management information system which contains data on 
recipients physicians and pharmacies according to the gao report 
accounting office while separate statistics arent collected on 
controlled drug transactions gao found that data contained in 
the mmiss can be manipulated to produce reports that may be useful 
in the identification of providers who may be diverting controlled 
substances 
the gao said mmis data could be helpful in spotting controlled 
substance prescription abuses within the medicaid program through 
closer analysis of the data and sharing the information with law 
enforcement agencies 
for example gao auditors analyzed all pharmacies in new york 
where 20 percent or more of their medicaid claims in 1986 involved 
controlled substances they found 11 drugstores that were 
substantially above statewide average for business involving 
controlled substances of those seven were disqualified from 
medicaid in 1987 
the gao was careful to note however the a higherthanaverage 
level of controlled substance sales is not necessarily an abuse of 
the program 
the report recommended that the health and human services 
secretary in consultation with the department of justice test the 
usefulness and cost of analyzing and providing mmis controlled 
substances data to law enforcement regulatory and licensing 
agencies 
rangel who is chairman of the house select committee on 
narcotics abuse and control said he would hold a hearing early in 
the next congress on the feasibility of nationwide use of mmis data 
to spot controlled substance abuses

iran wants foreign hostages in lebanon 
freed but when it might happen is not clear a church of england 
emissary said monday 
bishop john brown said he was in beirut to investigate the fate 
of four missing iranians so tehran would use its influence with 
proiranian shiite moslem extremists who hold foreign captives 
the impression one gets very much is that the iranians are 
very anxious to have the hostages situation taken right off their 
agenda said brown who is the anglican bishop of cyprus based 
in nicosia 
eighteen foreigners now are held in lebanon among them nine 
americans and three britons they include anglican church envoy 
terry waite and terry a anderson chief middle east correspondent 
of the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 1985 and is 
the foreign hostage held longest 
asked whether waite and the others would be freed soon the 
bishop said i have no feeling about the timing of it i feel he 
waite will be released but i have no knowledge of the timing 
brown arrived sunday from iran on his second visit to lebanon in 
a month as representative of archbishop of canterbury robert 
runcie spiritual head of the church of england and leader of the 
worlds anglicans he spoke in a telephone interview with the ap 
on sunday brown spent an hour with patriarch mar nasrallah 
butros sfeir spiritual head of lebanons maronite catholics the 
main christian sect 
when i came the first time a month ago i was asking questions 
about four iranian hostages brown said this time i really 
came back to ask the same people especially the maronite 
leadership if there are any answers 
the bishop said he had some leads but would not elaborate 
he seeks information on four iranians who disappeared while 
driving in the christian heartland north of beirut after israels 
1982 invasion of lebanon revolutionary guards commander ahmad

irans official news agency and their driver a lebanese with an 
iranian passport 
hashemi rafsanjani speaker of irans parliament and its 
military commander has promised to help free british hostages if 
the church of england learns the fate of the missing iranians 
i would like to know from the christian elements in beirut 
whether or not there are any iranian hostages alive at all brown 
said this would be an enormous help for us 
brown would not say whether he would travel to moslem west 
beirut to talk with moslem leaders about the chances of getting 
hostages freed 
waite 48 disappeared jan 20 1987 after leaving a west 
beirut hotel for a meeting with captors of american hostages

the environmental protection agency said 
monday it is banning construction of new facilities in greater los 
angeles that pose a major air pollution threat a ban that could be 
extended to a dozen other us cities this fall 
the epa is legally required to move against los angeles because 
an eightmonth moratorium on pollution penalties expires at 
midnight tuesday congress imposed the moratorium last december to 
give itself more time to revise and clarify the clean air act 
but negotiations over revising the law are stalled by 
disagreements over acid rain and other issues and legislators hold 
out little hope of resolving the impasse before congress adjourns 
sometime in october for election campaigning 
the epas construction ban applies only to facilities that 
annually produce more than 100 tons of carbon monoxide or volatile 
compounds like gasoline that form ozone a major component of smog 
which causes lung damage 
oil refineries paint shops at auto assembly plants or large 
printing plants might emit that much ozonecausing pollution but 
none is planned in the los angeles area 
a representative of state air pollution officers said the epas 
action was little more than a paper tiger california official 
james lents said it would have no immediate impact on his state 
whose regulations already forbid construction of facilities 
emitting more than a few tons of pollutants annually 
but lents executive officer of californias south coast air 
quality management district said it might be harder to build 
needed sewage treatment plants if the ban continues for very long 
in announcing the ban epa administrator lee m thomas renewed 
his appeal for congress to provide guidance on dealing with the 107 
cities or other areas that failed to meet federal air quality 
standards last year for ozone carbon monoxide or both the 107 
areas cover about onethird of the us population 
thomas said if congress fails to act again this year the result 
could be many more sanctions on areas as well as mandatory 
federal pollution plans and litigation which will only further 
delay reaching the goal we all want clean air 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress says existing law is not silent on the issue as thomas 
contends and that all 107 areas should be penalized 
decisions on similar construction bans are pending for ventura 
county calif and for the indiana and illinois suburbs of chicago 
before the end of the year the epa expects to adopt a policy 
requiring areas not meeting pollution standards to demonstrate 
steady progress with a goal of an average 3 percent reduction in 
pollution concentrations annually apart from any nationwide 
reductions 
when it adopts that policy the agency will decide whether to 
impose construction bans at denver reno nev bakersfield

mexicos leftwing opposition which shocked 
the longtime ruling party with its showing in the july national 
vote faces a survival test as a political force in a series of 
state elections this fall 
its possible that there will be a united front of leftist 
parties but the creation of a single party is far away says 
raul jardon spokesman for the mexican socialist party one of four 
that joined the democratic front 
the democratic front and the rightist national action party are 
battling the ruling institutional revolutionary party pri in the 
house of deputies which is sitting as an electoral college to 
certify the election by a thursday deadline 
the opposition parties claim the pri won both the presidential 
election and many house seats by fraud 
the democratic front was a disparate group that joined in 
opposition to the pri for the july 6 elections along with the 
mexican socialist party it includes the authentic mexican 
revolutionary party the popular socialist party and the cardenist 
front 
the parties support a larger government role in the economy and 
a moratorium on payments of mexicos 104 billion foreign debt but 
beyond that their roots and interests differ 
the cardenas front was created by cuauhtemoc cardenas a former 
pri state governor and senator and includes many former members of 
the pri especially from the pris socalled democratic current 
which sought a party primary before the presidential election 
the authentic revolutionary party was founded in 1954 by 
militarist members of the pri who were dissatisfied with their 
marginal position in the party 
the popular socialist party was founded in 1929 and advocates 
pushing the government gradually toward socialism 
the mexican socialist party last to join the front includes 
what was once the mexican communist party and has the most radical 
agenda its presidential candidate herberto castillo announced 
his candidacy but withdrew in favor of cardenas who ran as the 
candidate of the united leftwing opposition 
the other candidates were carlos salinas de gortari who 
according to official returns won with 50 percent of the vote the 
first time a pri candidate finished under 70 percent in official 
tabulations since the party was founded in 1929 
cardenas took 31 percent but claims fraud robbed him of victory 
national action party candidate manuel j clouthier received 17 
percent 
the main challenge facing the democratic front is to form a 
real political party said a pri official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity they got together for the elections but that was 
tactical 
pri doesnt believe the four parties can continue to work 
together party officials said they also said the oppositions 
victory in mexico city made party members realize they had to work 
harder 
before the end of the year that determination will be tested as 
11 of mexicos 31 states have gubernatorial elections in five 
states jalisco guanajuato san luis potosi nuevo leon and 
tabasco the pris winning margins on july 6 were thin 
the pri has not lost a governorship since it was founded but 
national action spokesman ricardo garcia cervantes said the party 
hoped to break that string in december in jalisco which the pri 
won with a plurality of 42 percent in july 
the federal election commission only gave us eight of the 14 
districts out of 20 that we actually won in the state if theyd 
given us all 14 you would see how strong we really are there 
said garcia were going after the governorship 
jardon said the democratic front would run a single candidate 
for the governorship in the state of tabasco where cardenas did 
well 
and unity is not evident in veracruz on the gulf of mexico 
where municipal elections are due oct 2 
about 550 candidates are registered for the elections according 
to state election commission official anastasio reyes marquez

former democratic congressman john 
jenrette said his occasional golfing partner during the 1970s 
republican vice presidential nominee dan quayle is a strong 
candidate but wouldnt be a good vice president 
jenrette in an interview with the myrtle beach sc sun news 
questioned whether the campaign of gop nominee george bush 
conducted a thorough check of quayles background the indiana 
senators service in the national guard at the height of the 
vietnam war has created a controversy for the republican ticket 
the problems should have been found and treated jenrette 
said 
the former congressman said quayle has hurt himself more than 
any of the news reports about him because of the way he has 
acted not having a straight answer ready 
george bush is famous for having a silver foot in his mouth 
the democrat said you have two people making these mistakes now 
i fear that theres a lot more to come a lot of peoples memories 
will be jogged by the things that seemed little at the time it 
will bring together an image and therell be more people bantering 
wanting to get a piece of the action be a quayle killer 
the 52yearold jenrette said he invited quayle on several 
golfing outings in south carolina during the 1970s but has not 
talked to the indiana senator for five or six years 
george bush thought he was getting a stuffed shirt just like 
himself but he didnt jenrette told the newspaper dans been 
down here a number of times and always had a good time i would 
rather have someone whos done something and learned what lifes 
all about than someone whos been sheltered 
quayle is a good vice presidential candidate though he 
wouldnt be a good vice president he said 
jenrette served in congress from 19751980 when he narrowly 
lost reelection two weeks after being found guilty of accepting a 
bribe his exwife rita jenrette made national headlines with a

the justice department said today it will not 
appeal a federal court decision that allowed the palestine 
liberation organization mission at the united nations in new york 
to remain open 
the department said in a statement that the decision was based 
on a determination that on balance the interests of the united 
states are best served by not appealing 
congress had sought to force the closing of the plo mission at 
the un on the grounds that the plo endorsed terrorism 
but the state department objected on the grounds that closing 
the office would violate the un headquarters agreement the un 
also objected 
on june 29 us district court judge edmund palmieri accepted 
that view the justice department said the antiterrorism act of 
1987 did not require closing the plo office in new york because 
congress did not clearly indicate its intent on the face of the 
statute to violate us obligations under the un headquarters 
agreement 
the justice department said the administration normally appeals 
adverse federal court decisions of this kind but it was decided 
in the light of foreign policy considerations including the us 
role as host to the un organization not to appeal in this 
instance 
if that is the true position of the justice department they 
are now moving in line with international law and the commitment of 
the host country under the headquarters agreement to honor the 
agreement and not to violate it said riyad h mansour the 
plos charge daffaires when asked about the ruling at un 
headquarters in new york 
us officials speaking on condition they not be named said 
the justice department had lobbied hard to pursue an appeal but 
the state department view prevailed in the end 
sen jesse helms rnc had written a letter last week to 
white house chief of staff kenneth duberstein recommending the 
decision be appealed 
at issue is the question of who determines the sovereign 
powers of the united states the congress and the president 
through the constitutional process or the united nations and a 
single district court judge in new york he said 
helms and sen william roth rdel said if the court ruling 
stands american ability to control access of foreign nationals to 
the united states would be weakened 
the department said it will continue to oppose efforts to 
reopen the plo office in washington which is not covered by the 
un agreement

a homeless protester who fired cannon 
blasts and threatened to destroy historic fort vancouver gave up 
his occupation of the log building today in exchange for a chance 
to talk to reporters authorities said 
the protester who gave his name as ken rose 40 apparently 
acted alone 
police had surrounded the fort after the man scaled the 15foot 
walls and left a note protesting treatment of the homeless and 
vietnam veterans 
at least four explosions came from the log structure including 
at least two from replicas of cannons said police capt ray 
anderson he said the cannons appeared to have been loaded only 
with black powder and the explosions were little more than puffs of 
smoke 
no injuries were reported and anderson said there were no 
indications of damage 
rose said he most recently lived in the tillamook ore area 
and was recently treated in the veterans administration hospital in 
portland ore for posttraumatic stress syndrome and alcoholism 
he said he was not drinking during the incident 
before he was arrested and taken away rose told reporters he 
entered the reconstructed stockade to draw attention to the plight 
of vietnam veterans he said he gave himself up on the condition he 
could speak to the press 
earlier he had asked to speak to a catholic priest a 
psychiatrist or psychologist from the portland ore veterans 
adminstration hospital and to rep lane evans dill a member of 
the house veterans affairs committee who is visiting the state 
a note left outside the 4acre fort said it was taken by 
vietnam veterans at 430 am but anderson and others said there 
was no evidence more than one person was involved 
any attempts to retake the fort will result in the destruction 
of the fort the note said 
an fbi negotiator was on the scene anderson said the fbi had 
jurisdiction because the site is a federal landmark 
the original fort was built in the early 1800s but deteriorated 
later in the 19th century the structure was rebuilt after the fort 
was named a historic site in 1961 the stockade was used as a fur 
trading post from 1825 to 1849

two trains collided headon in western 
austria near the west german border killing five people and 
injuring 52 authorities said 
the general director of the austrian railroad authority 
heinrich uebleis said human error probably caused the accident 
the worst in austria in 17 years 
the accident at 1237 pm on an overpass outside the wolfurt 
train station in the western province of vorarlberg involved a 
train en route to west germany from vienna and an express train 
headed for the alpine city of innsbruck from the west german border 
town of lindau said a spokesman for the austrian railroad 
authority 
guntram fonach a civilian rescue official in the district of 
laudrach where the accident occured said five people were killed 
and 52 injured he said 19 were seriously hurt and had to be taken 
to hospital 
the trains were moving along the same track when they collided 
crushing one car and derailing two others no debris fell to the 
road below 
a passenger interviewed by austrian tv said there was no warning 
nothing there was a crash and then it was over nothing 
she said 
a man sitting on a blanket in the grass near the wreck said 
it happened so fast 
ernst tscherett of the railway authority who was interviewed by 
television at the scene said the accident appeared to have been 
caused by human error on the part of the engineer of the train from 
west germany 
railroad officials said one track was closed and trains headed 
into austria had to be transfered to the opposite track the 
express train from west germany should have stopped outside the 
wolfurt station to wait for a signal to move to the opposite track 
they said 
however it continued through the red signal although it had 
slowed and was only traveling at a speed of about 27 mph at impact 
uebleis said he said the other train was traveling at about 45 mph 
the technology was in order uebleis said human error 
seems to exist he said 
officials refused to identify the dead and injured 
walther kollerits of the railway authority said the driver of 
the train from vienna was among the dead as was a 67yearold 
woman he said there were many west germans on the trains but 
refused to give the nationality of the dead or injured 
the tracks were closed to traffic and international trains were 
being rerouted via switzerland or west germany he said 
firefighters and railway workers began clearing the wreckage 
from the track and searching for any passengers who might be 
trapped in the debris

while the us militarys aerobatic stunt 
teams have suffered fatal accidents in the past they have never 
killed a spectator and routinely face scrutiny from a federal 
agency that limits the maneuvers they perform 
we control the airspace so it is up to us to make sure that 
all operations in that airspace are conducted properly and 
safely john leyden a spokesman for the federal aviation 
administration said monday 
the air force thunderbirds and the navy blue angels put 
their shows together but we decide on a showbyshow basis whether 
there is airspace to accomodate the maneuvers safely 
leyden and defense department officials declined to speculate on 
the cause of a spectacular crash sunday during an air show at the 
usoperated ramstein air base in west germany three italian air 
force jets collided during a highspeed manuever and one fell into 
the crowd killing at least 45 people and injuring about 500 
according to eyewitness accounts however the italian air force 
teams 10 jets were flying about 180 feet off the ground and 
intersecting over the field from three different directions when 
the accident occurred the maneuver put some of the jets on a 
course directly toward the crowd 
we wouldnt allow aerobatic maneuvers above the crowd said 
leyden our minimum flight line for jets is 1500 feet from the 
crowd and we require all maneuvers be performed along that line 
in santa barbara calif white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
told reporters were reluctant to pass judgment on this episode 
or on air shows in general it certainly does however emphasize 
the need for vigilance and safety 
tom poberezny an official with the experimental aircraft 
association who is also a stunt pilot with the civilian flying 
eagles team said the faa rules made an accident like the one in 
west germany unlikely here 
indeed the italian freece tricolori team involved in sundays 
crash was required to alter its flying routine at the eaas 1986 
airshow to keep the stunt pilots from flying toward the crowd 
poberezny said 
overall the safety record for air shows in this country is 
really outstanding said leyden adding that more than 200 such 
shows take place annually 
the blue angels and thunderbirds have appeared at many of those 
shows for decades 
the blue angels were formed in 1946 and have performed before 
more than 200 million people the thunderbirds were organized in 
1953 and have appeared before more than 170 million 
the season for both teams normally begins in march and extends 
to midnovember featuring anywhere from 70 to 90 performances 
both teams have known good times and bad last year the blue 
angels suffered a training accident in el centro calif that 
destroyed a plane although no one was killed in july 1985 
however a pilot was killed during a blue angel demonstration over 
niagara falls ny 
the last fatal accident involving the thunderbirds and the 
worst in their history occurred on jan 18 1982 during a 
practice session in nevada four pilots died as a team followed its 
leader into the ground 
all told the blue angels have lost 22 pilots and the 
thunderbirds have lost 19 the services say 
neither we nor the blue angels have ever harmed a spectator 
and that shows how well thought out our maneuvers are and our 
compliance with the faa guidelines said lt col steve trent 
leader of the thunderbirds 
crowd safety is our no 1 priority we do not perform any 
maneuver that does not ensure proper lateral and vertical 
separation from the crowd 
trent said the air force does not allow any crossing maneuver 
that puts formations of planes against each other only individual 
planes and that any such crosses must be performed beyond the end 
of the crowd 
pentagon officials consider the teams as great for recruiting 
and an important tool for showing the public what its tax dollars 
are buying 
the navy for example determined last year that 63 percent of 
the students entering navy flight school had seen at least one blue 
angels performance and that of those almost 40 percent cited the 
team as a direct influence on their decision to join the military 
both teams also fly the latest in frontline jet fighters the 
navys fa18 and the air forces f16

president gen augusto pinochet and the 
other military commanders meet tuesday to pick a nominee for an 
october presidential referendum that could extend pinochets period 
of rule to 1997 
pinochet 72 who has ruled chile since a 1973 coup appears 
virtually assured of the nomination propinochet groups have 
planned a celebration rally tuesday night in front of the 
government palace 
pinochet who commands the army navy chief adm jose merino 
air force leader gen fernando matthei and national police director 
gen rodolfo stange are scheduled to meet at midday tuesday in 
strict privacy at the defense ministry building to decide on a 
nominee 
the meeting of the military commanders comes amid an 
intensifying political campaign by government backers as well as 
opponents and a lastminute wave of voter registration 
the 1980 constitution which outlines a phased return to 
democratic rule gives the commanders 48 hours to make a unanimous 
choice government officials however say they expect the session 
to conclude within hours and have made arrangements for the 
announcement ceremony later tuesday 
if the commanders are unable to reach a unanimous decision 
within 48 hours the constitution calls for nomination by majority 
decision of an eightman national security council that includes 
pinochet the other commanders and four other top officials three 
of whom were appointed by pinochet 
no exact date has been announced for the referendum but it is 
expected to disclosed tuesday along with the candidate if a 
majority of voters cast yes ballots in the referendum the 
nominee will begin an eightyear term march 11 if a majority 
reject him an open election will be held in 1990 
once the candidate is announced registration of voters will 
halt since february more than 7 million of the countrys 8 
million eligible voters have registered 
on monday long lines of wouldbe voters were lined up at 
registration centers to beat the deadline as they did on friday 
authorities were expected to extend the hours for registration so 
that people would not be turned away 
both pro and antigovernment groups have intensified their 
publicity campaigns in connection with the referendum 
advertisements directly urging a yes vote were being aired 
regularly on television radio and in newspapers and magazines the 
ads warned that if the candidate is rejected chile would return 
to the social and economic chaos of the early 1970s when a marxist 
salvador allende was president 
allendes elected government was toppled in the bloody 1973 coup 
led by pinochet he died in the takeover 
a 16party coalition of opposition groups was busy planning a 
downtown rally for sunday anticipating that tens of thousands of 
people would attend they also began a new publicity campaign with 
ads recalling pinochets promise several years back that he would 
not run again for president 
no more lies the ads declared

oil has been found beneath a paris suburb and 
officials with the statecontrolled oil company said monday they 
were encouraged by the success of their first wildcat well in the 
capital 
exploratory drilling began three weeks ago on a permit granted 
to the company societe nationale elf aquitaine for the 
parisisledefrance region 
after the seismic tests we did we figured we would find 
something said thomas saunders a spokesman for the oil company 
but we thought there was maybe one chance out of six or seven 
everybodys very pleased of course that we found something the 
first time 
elf aquitaine holds a 50 percent share of the permit with 
totalcompagnie francaises des petroles owning 35 percent and 
british petroleum france holding the rest the permit was awarded 
in december 1985 
the elftotalbp joint venture has already spent 116 million 
on the permit to drill most of it for seismic tests said elfs 
chief of french operations bruno weymuller 
it was important to find oil to show that we are right to be 
drilling in the region said patrick oberto director of 
exploration for bp france 
the paris basin which contains 636 million barrels of known 
oil reserves 48 operating wells and about 600 exploratory wells 
has a discovery rate of 1 in 12 wells the paris basin extends over 
50000 square miles from paris east to west germany 
the first paris well produced oil with small quantities of water 
during a test at a depth of 1972 yards the well was drilled in 
the suburb of ivry on the left bank of the seine river about 500 
yards from the elevated freeway that encircles paris 
ivry 101 was drilled at an angle and the oilbearing rock was 
struck under an apartment building across the seine in the adjacent 
suburb of alfortville the company said 
saunders said the oil was found friday and that tests on sunday 
confirmed oil was present in the rock more tests will be conducted 
over the next 10 days to determine the quality of the oil and the 
extent of the find 
we havent found a lagoon of oil this isnt texas it is all 
impregnated in stone and we need to figure out if it will be 
econmically feasible to produce it saunders said 
about 10 million people live in the 587 square miles covered by 
the permit 
ivry 101 is the first of several exploratory wells to be drilled 
in the suburbs to the north south and east of paris about 60 
workers remain at the site and drilling continues around the clock 
the company said

while the fbi and nasa investigated cuts 
in some space shuttle booster orings the manufacturer of the 
critical rocket seals said monday it has taken measures to guard 
against sabotage 
both seal maker hydrapak and rocket maker morton thiokol inc 
which contracts with the company for the rubberlike orings said 
none of the damaged seals had been shipped to or received by 
morton thiokol 
james dockstader hydrapak vice president of production said 
monday a very small number of orings that appeared to have 
been deliberately cut were found by the company in june the fbi 
nasa and morton thiokol were immediately notified he said 
we have taken steps to correct that problem and we dont 
expect that problem to recur dockstader said 
he refused to specify the measures taken but didnt rule out 
improving security at the companys operations in west jordan 
about 20 miles south of salt lake city 
we had good security before this happened dockstader said 
but were always looking at ways to improve our security 
former hydrapak inspector cathy crocker has said she was forced 
to resign not long after she discovered three slashed orings in 
may management was unable to determine who was responsible she 
said 
dockstader said he could not discuss details of confidential 
personnel actions but added we have not discharged anyone 
relative to this investigation ill put it that way 
however he would not say whether any employees had been 
disciplined 
fbi special agent cal clegg said his offices investigation of 
the incidents was continuing but he could not say how far the 
probe was from being completed clegg confirmed that the 
possibility of sabotage was being explored 
nasa inspector general bill colvin confirmed that sabotage is 
still part of the investigation but would not comment on other 
aspects of the case including the possibility of action against 
hydrapak 
improvements to the shuttle booster oring has been a major 
focus of morton thiokols 2year effort to redesign the rocket 
blamed for the jan 28 1986 challenger disaster 
a presidential commission found that an oring located in a 
challenger booster rocket field joint allowed superhot gases to 
escape and ignite the shuttles exterior fuel tank during launch 
seven astronauts died in the subsequent explosion that destroyed 
the spacecraft 
on aug 18 morton thiokol culminated its effort to overhaul the 
booster with an apparently successful testfiring of its redesigned 
rocket at the companys northern utah plant 25 miles west of 
brigham city 
the 20 million twominute firing was the fifth and final 
qualifying test needed before the 126footlong booster can be 
cleared for flight 
the nations manned space flight program has been grounded since 
the challenger accident nasa has said discovery will be launched 
in late september of early october

sunday at the trinity church in kampala that medical evidence 
showed aids cannot be transmitted through sharing the chalice 
radio uganda reported 
since november anglican worshipers in uganda had pieces of 
bread dipped in wine during the holy communion instead of the usual 
placing of bread in the mouth before sipping wine from a communal

the veterans administration has taken more 
than 13000 beds at va hospitals out of service while telling 
congress that budget cuts have not hurt service the house veterans 
affairs committee charged monday 
it is amazing the dramatic contrast between what we are 
learning from the field and what we are told officially by va 
officials in washington said rep gv montgomery dmiss 
chairman of the panel 
the committee will hold a hearing on the matter sept 7 after 
congress returns from its august recess 
lula tyler a va spokeswoman declined to respond to 
montgomerys statements because she said she hadnt seen the 
committees survey 
committee staff members studied the nations va hospitals in the 
wake of assurances by va administrator thomas turnage that the 
agency wasnt making compromises because of budget cuts 
the nations 172 va hospitals had an average of 73588 beds 
available at the end of june the committee found the review also 
disclosed that 13039 beds were not available for a variety of 
reasons including renovation or construction projects lack of 
money or staff shortages 
but victor raymond a spokesman for the committee said the 
staff was unable to determine exactly how many beds are available 
to veterans on an average day he also said he did not know if any 
veterans had been denied care because beds were not available 
as a result the number of veterans being denied treatment is 
unclear montgomery said the va offers medical care for the many 
of nations 28 million military veterans 
montgomery said the staff survey found that local va hospital 
directors are being forced to juggle resources to meet daily 
operating requirements 
he claimed that the vas main office is either oblivious to 
the problem wellinsulated from its true magnitude or is toeing 
the administration line with little regard to its consequences for 
americans veterans 
in another development turnage issued a statement disputing a 
report issued aug 21 by the house government operations committee 
that said the va made numerous errors in processing disability 
claims by veterans turnage said the report was grossly 
misleading 
the house committee said applicants filed by veterans who had no 
pull were handled rapidly by errorprone managers trying to 
earn pay bonuses for meeting production quotas 
but the bureau of veterans appeals which is the court of last 
appeal for veterans denied benefits maintained a list of 
congressmen who should be brought to the bva chairmans attention 
if they inquire about an appeal the committee said 
the vast majority of va claims decisions are accurate and 
acceptable to veterans who file them the va said in response 
the committees report is based on an extremely limited overview 
of va claims activity and on isolated anecdotes that hardly 
represent either the entire system or quality improvement measures 
adopted in recent years 
kenneth eaton chairman of the bva said the board was not 
guilty of bias based on congressional interest in specific cases 
i review various cases after decisions are reached and i do so 
only for management purposes eaton said 
the house committee said some members of the bva reviewed cases 
at a rate of one every eight minutes the va said that finding was 
based on a flawed statistic computed by a former bva employee 
in fact the va said each threemember panel spends an average 
of 27 hours per decision

george bush said monday that michael dukakis gives the 
impression of being against every new weapons system since the 
slingshot a newly aggressive massachusetts governor fired back 
that his republican rivals call for a cut the capital gains tax 
amounts to a handout for the wealthy 
the combatants in an increasingly heated battle for the white 
house exchanged barbs as their senior aides prepared to meet in 
washington on tuesday to open facetoface negotiations over 
campaign debates bush has said no debate is likely before sept 
20 and he added during the day im not about to be stampeded 
by democratic demands for an earlier date 
fresh public opinion polls provided a snapshot of what both 
parties say will be an unusually close race this fall among them 
was a survey indicating that dukakis oncesubstantial margin has 
been washed away completely in california the biggest state with 
47 electoral votes 
bush held a nine percentage point lead in a separate survey in 
missouri a key swing state and dukakis owned an 11point bulge in 
wisconsin both states have 11 electoral votes 
bush who has consistently challenged dukakis on defense issues 
continued the barrage at a campaign stop in st louis 
he belittled his democratic opponent for saying the united 
states needs antitank weapons rather than the mx mobile missile 
adding that both systems are needed for national security 
sometimes he gives me the impression hes against every new 
weapons system since the slingshot the vice president said on a 
day that included a tour of a defense plant in missouri and a visit 
to a rotc program in tennessee 
bush also said his running mate indiana sen dan quayle has 
absorbed a tremendous pounding over his national guard service 
and other issues and has emerged to where he will be an asset 
to the gop ticket 
he said it doesnt bother me a bit that he and quayle differ 
on some issues and that the senator seemed unaware in a boston 
globe interview that the vice president headed a presidential panel 
on drug interdiction 
quayle and his democratic counterpart texas sen lloyd bentsen 
took a day off from campaign traveling 
dukakis embarked on a twoday tour of western massachusetts and 
he seemed eager to close the books on the last few weeks the 
period since the democratic national convention during which his 
oncesolid lead in national public opinion polls turned into a 
deficit 
the dog days of august are almost over he said as he 
returned bushs fire on the subjects of crime and drugs and said 
there is no need to debate the patriotism of the two candidates 
at a news conference that was scheduled canceled and then 
rescheduled dukakis said he wanted to ask his opponent about the 
16000 furloughs granted to federal prisoners last year some 
lasting 45 days and many to convicted drug pushers mr bush says he 
wants to execute 
bush has criticized dukakis for a massachusetts furlough program 
in which a prisoner on a weekend pass raped a woman the vice 
president also favors the death penalty for drug kingpins 
dukakis has been the subject of unusual criticism from his own 
party in recent weeks for running an insufficiently aggressive 
campaign and permitting bush to seize the offensive the governor 
conceded his campaign message of recent weeks may have been lost in 
the somewhat extraordinary coverage of the republican national 
convention the furor over quayle and unsubstantiated rumors about 
himself and his wife kitty his news conference was briefly dropped 
from his schedule when senior aides said they wanted to force 
television coverage of dukakis speech 
in his remarks dukakis seemed to reply to bushs attacks over 
his veto of state legislation requiring teachers to lead their 
students in the pledge of allegiance a law the state superme court 
said in an advisory opinion was unconstitutional 
the american peoplearent interested in a debate over which 
one of us loves his country the most we all love this country 
there should be no debate about that he said 
dukakis said he was not going to accept mr bushs suggestion 
that the way to build opportunity for our citizens is to cut taxes 
for the wealthy again this time a fiveyear 40 billion 
handout seventy percent of which would go to those making 200000 
a year or more 
bush has called for cutting the capital gains tax which is a 
levy on investment profits dukakis aides said the governors 
estimates came from two publications on the subject 
bush and dukakis made their campaign rounds as their political 
allies weighed in from the sidelines 
senate republican leader bob dole said the dukakis campaign was 
on a roll downhill and the governor has virtually become 
the rip van winkle of 1988 he said gop chances of taking control 
of the senate have been enhanced as a result 
democratic chairman paul kirk spoke up on dukakis behalf 
saying bushs campaign has been fundamentally a negative campaign 
of distortion and deception he said the vice opresident was 
using transcontinental slurs and smearing tactics while seeking 
to avoid debates

the incident occurred within sight of the norfolk naval station 
tom carpenter a former navy helicopter crewman was watching 
the eisenhower from his sixth floor window of the hotel chamberlin 
which overlooks the anchorage 
i was watching the ship through binoculars and it seemed to 
get closer and closer to the freighter that was riding on its 
moorage it look like the wind blew the ike into the freighter 
there was a cloud of debris when they struck he said 
carpenter from silver spring md and his wife patricia 
watched as the ships hung together for three to five minutes 
before the carrier appeared to pull away under its own power

prospects for another good cotton crop in 1988 
could push the total supply for the coming year to the highest 
level in more than two decades an agriculture department report 
said monday 
based on aug 1 indications the cotton harvest could be 149 
million bales up from 148 million bales last year the 
departments economic research service said the increase would 
result from a larger acreage this year despite a reduction in 
peracre yields 
in all counting cotton left over from previous harvests the 
total 198889 supply will be about 205 million bales the most 
since the 196667 season 
because domestic and export use is not keeping pace with 
production the us cotton stockpile when the next marketing year 
begins on aug 1 1989 could rise to 89 million bales from an 
estimated carryover of 56 million bales this aug 1 the report 
said 
meanwhile world cotton production in 198889 is expected to 
rise to nearly 86 million bales up 7 percent from last season 
foreign production at about 71 million bales is expected to gain 
5 million bales including record crops in india greece turkey 
and australia 
world cotton consumption forecast at nearly 83 million bales 
will about match last season the report said cotton use is 
expected to increase primarily among producing countries while 
falling among importers 
as a result world cotton stocks are expected to increase nearly 
9 percent in 198889 to more than 35 million bales by the end of 
the season all of the buildup will occur in the united states 
while foreign inventories are expected to decline 2 percent 
the report said us cotton has not been priced competitively 
in world markets for several months and that reduced export 
sales along with large crops last year and in 1988 translate into 
the rise in inventories and higher costs of operating the 
governments support program 
thus to make us cotton more competitive officials said 
several changes were made recently in the the price support 
program one change was in the formula for setting the adjusted 
world price of cotton which is used in determining in how 
producers settle up their price support loans 
these changes in the upland cotton program have lowered the 
adjusted world price for base quality cotton as well as coarse 
count cotton and reduced the cost of redeeming cotton under loan 
with cash the report said these revisions are expected to 
have a significant influence on us export potential for the 
remainder of this marketing year

two of them and a judge ordered him not to drive a car while he 
awaits trial 
bruce kimball faces two counts of drunkendriving manslaughter 
and three counts of drunkendriving in an accident with serious 
injury 
judge harry coe allowed the 1984 olympic silver medalist to 
remain free on 10000 bond and said he would not restrict 
kimballs travel before his tentative trial date of nov 14 because 
he was satisified the diver posed no risk of flight 
the judge also said the highprofile case had drawn so much 
publicity that the whole country in a sense is watching him 
kimball who finished second in the olympic platform diving 
competition four years ago was a favorite to make the 1988 us 
team before the aug 1 accident however he did not qualify for 
this years squad during olympic trials in indianapolis earlier 
this month 
kimball 24 said nothing when attorney frank quesada entered 
the plea before coe if convicted kimball faces up to 45 years in 
prison 
codefense counsel lee fugate did not object to the driving 
restriction as a condition of bond saying kimball would be 
attending the university of michigan this fall and working 
parttime at his fathers diving school and could walk

a newsletter editor said monday the justice 
department told him that us attorneys are prohibited from 
answering his written questions relating to the investigation of 
former attorney general edwin meese iii 
russell mokhiber editor of corporate crime reporter released a 
letter in which manuel a rodriguez legal counsel for the 
executive office for us attorneys said mokhiber needed to get 
permission to obtain answers to his survey 
department of justice policy prohibits us attorneys from 
responding to surveys unless they are endorsed by the executive 
office for us attorneys rodriguez wrote on aug 10 two days 
before meese left office mokhiber said he received the letter last 
week 
rodriquez said that under a 1980 order signed by former attorney 
general benjamin civiletti all surveys of us attorneys must be 
coordinated by the executive office 
surveys include questionnaires from other justice department 
offices as well as those from other organizations such as 
research groups government research contractors and grantees 
congressional committees and congress members the order says 
rodriguez told mokhiber the executive office has determined 
that it would not be in the best interests of the department of 
justice to permit the us attorneys to participate in your 
survey 
a department official who spoke only on condition that he not 
be identified said the 1980 order was intended to keep us 
attorneys from being deluged by informationseekers 
any us attorney can answer either a telephone or written 
survey if he or she wants the official said but as a matter of 
policy the prosecutor probably would not respond to a written 
questionnaire unless it had been approved by the executive office 
mokhiber who sent his onepage survey to most of the 93 us 
attorneys on july 29 said he never received any replies 
in the survey mokhiber posed several hypothetical questions 
requiring a yes or no answer 
the questions did not mention meese by name but they referred 
to an independent counsels investigation of the attorney general 
mokhiber said his questions were prompted by independent counsel 
james mckays investigation of meeses personal and financial 
dealings 
mckay found that criminal prosecution of meese was not 
warranted although he said the former attorney general probably 
violated tax and conflictofinterest laws meese said the report 
vindicated him 
mokhiber asked the us attorneys to pretend they were an 
independent counsel he then spelled out in broad terms allegations 
similiar to those made against meese 
mokhiber then asked if the us attorneys would have prosecuted 
the attorney general given a statement that the attorney general 
probably violated the law and written a report detailing their 
findings 
in the letter mokhiber said he had planned to tabulate the 
results in corporate crime reporter a twoyearold weekly 
newsletter with about 100 subscribers

the role of vice president george bush in the 
irancontra affair remains an important unanswered question in the 
presidential campaign according to a new book by two senators a 
democrat and a republican who investigated the scandal 
the two authors maine senators william cohen and george 
mitchell conclude that the republican nominee should have been 
aware that an armsforhostages deal with iran was being arranged 
and that he endorsed it cohen a republican and mitchell a 
democrat were members of the congressional irancontra 
investigating panel and the first insiders to write their own book 
about the probe 
the vice president endorsed the sale of weapons to iran either 
out of loyalty to the president or because he too was consumed by 
the passion to obtain the freedom of the hostages the two 
senators wrote in the book men of zeal a candid inside story of 
the irancontra hearings 
questioned monday during the vice presidents campaign stop in 
tennessee chief of staff craig fuller said the book provided 
nothing new on bushs role in the affair 
i dont believe there are any new insights contained in the 
book its more a readable version of information that was 
gleaned from thousands of hours of hearings that were conducted 
fuller said weve seen nothing new on the vice president 
bush has sought to put the affair behind him saying repeatedly 
that while he nominally was president reagans antiterrorism 
chief he was out of the loop on the iran matter and didnt 
understand a briefing on the arrangements he received in august 
1986 more than three months before the affair became public 
but he also has refused to talk about any discussions with 
reagan about the matter cohen and mitchell write that while it is 
possible bush cautioned against the deal evidence shows others in 
the administration were convinced that the vice president supported 
it 
and they voice the opinion that even if bush was not brought 
into the decisionmaking on this major foreign policy initiative 
his position of support would have remained the same 
the book breaks little new ground about the hearings but adds 
the perspective of two seasoned politicians on issues such as 
bushs awkward political position as reagans no 2 the mistakes 
made by the investigating panels in rushing the probe to beat 
deadlines and negotiating with cagey defense lawyers and the 
panels naive underestimation of how the hearings would play on 
television 
the senators note that no sitting vice president since martin 
van buren in 1836 has been elected president in part because of 
the conflict between the vice presidents perceived role as second 
in command and the reality that he usually is relegated to the 
sidelines 
whatever his personal views the vice president cannot 
publicly disagree with the presidents policies or action without 
fracturing the bond of unity they must maintain they wrote 
the vice president lacks flexibility to express his views even in 
private cabinetlevel sessions 
in recounting the highlights of last summers hearings and the 
jockeying that went on behind the scenes the authors note the 
frustration of being interrupted constantly by house and senate 
floor votes and the lack of time to prepare for each new witness 
the initial blunder they contend was allowing retired air 
force maj gen richard secord to become the leadoff witness for 
the televised hearings abandoning plans for a panel of wise 
men to first lay out for viewers the way in which covert 
intelligence operations are normally and legally conducted and 
overseen 
public reaction soon showed that secord the operative who ran 
much of the iran arms deal and the diversion of profits to 
nicaraguas contra rebels came off looking patriotic while the 
investigators had been perceived as hostile belligerent 
pompous patronizing or unpatriotic they said 
later using the panels own deadlines against them lawyers for 
lt col oliver north put their client before the television 
cameras largely on his own terms the committee had caved in 
the senators concluded when north testified he held a gatling 
gun while we sat like ducks in a shooting gallery the american 
people loved it a real rambo had come to washington 
the authors also point out several issues that investigators 
were unable to fully pursue including israels role in the initial 
opening to iranians that paved the way for the arms deals detailed 
accounting of the finances of secords enterprise and the 
activities of former cia director william casey who died on the 
second day of hearings and was never interviewed 
the book published by viking will be available in bookstores 
this week

the veteran pilots had planned to 
thrill their air show audience with a perfectly timed stunt to 
slickly manuever their 10 sleek jets into the shape of a huge 
highflying heart 
instead the aerial valentine turned into a fiery killer one 
jet collided with two others at the us air base at ramstein 
sunday then crashed into the crowd 
the disaster killed 46 people including the three italian air 
force pilots 
we have absolutely no idea what went wrong gen john 
galvin commanding officer of the north atlantic treaty 
organization told reporters monday at the air base 
he said italian authorities would lead the investigation into 
the tragedy 
a crowd of about 300000 people were watching as the italian 
pilots flying at nearly 450 mph began performing the maneuver in 
which the jets create a silhouette of a giant heart 
five of the planes came from one direction and four came from 
another a single plane came from yet another direction and there 
was a huge crash said a west german witness 
italian officials said that in the maneuver nine aircraft fly 
perpendicular to the runway and then begin to climb in front of the 
spectators at a certain point in the ascent the formation divides 
into two groups of four and five planes that turn away in opposite 
directions while descending in curves 
the two groups then fly past each other while traveling in 
opposite directions and parallel to the ground 
as a spectacular finish the 10th jet flies through the formation 
as the paths of the two groups of planes appear to intersect 
that was when the stunt turned into a disaster 
rainer bogensberger an amateur pilot who witnessed the tragedy 
said the solo airplane collided with two of the other jets and it 
then plowed into the audience in a huge fireball one of the 
other planes crashed onto a runway and the third plunged into a 
forest 
the remaining jets circled the airfield for a few minutes before 
landing 
witnesses said the jets were flying at an altitude of about 100 
feet when the accident occurred 
klaus koplin head of the federal aeronautics office in 
braunschweig said regulations require that aircraft other than 
helicopters stay above 500 feet 
the pilot may go below this minimum altitude only for the 
purpose of landing or taking off he said 
other west german officials noted that the rules for air shows 
at nato bases are set by the military commands involved and not 
civilian authorities 
galvin defended the competence of the italian air demonstration 
team 
this team has been doing that maneuver since 1961 there has 
never been an incident with that maneuver since then he said 
bogensberger said the tragedy could have been worse 
he said there were several military transport planes parked 
about 600 feet from where the jet crashed into the crowd and 
thousands of people were in that area 
if this machine flew on for just another 200 meters about 600 
feet it would have rammed right into these transport planes and 
would likely have set off huge explosions bogensberger said

chief justice william h rehnquist on monday 
criticized the senates judicial confirmation process saying that 
lawmakers expected judgeship nominees to give instant answers to 
complex constitutional questions 
speaking before the bicentennial australian legal convention in 
canberra australia rehnquist said nominees are not computers 
all primed to spew out answers when the proper button was 
pushed 
the text of the chief justices address was released by the 
supreme court 
rehnquist said a judge is not measured by his capacity to come 
up with instant answers to impromptu questions but by his 
ability to make a decision based on real life facts and lengthy 
study of the law 
he said that process is something which cannot possibly be 
duplicated in a committee hearing room and since it cannot be 
duplicated no nominee who is both prudent and honest can give 
categorical answers to detailed questions of constitutional law 
rehnquest who appeared before the senate judiciary committee as 
a nominee for associate justice and chief justice was especially 
critical of the process used to interrogate defeated supreme court 
nominee robert h bork 
i think i speak for a great number of my fellow citizens of 
the united states when i say there is a general feeling of 
dissatisfaction with the process attending judge borks nomination 
a feeling which is shared by many of those who were happy to see 
him denied confirmation rehnquist said 
he said the bork hearings consisted of exhaustingly detailed 
examination of the nominee on his views of constitutional law and 
in particular on his view of the extent to which our constitution 
recognized a right of privacy 
the nadir of the public debate was reached when newspapers 
publicized a list of home movies which the judge had checked out in 
the months preceeding his confirmation hearing to look at on his 
home movie viewer 
rehnquist did not suggest how hearings should change but 
criticized the prolonged interrogation involved in the bork 
hearings

michael dukakis should refine his message 
which is that the american people want change new york gov 
mario cuomo said monday 
cuomo who said he talked to fellow democrat dukakis on friday 
and has been talking with dukakis aides over the last few days 
about the message told a news conference you take the message 
and write it in 15 pages and then you have someone write it in 7 
pages and then you take the 7 and make it three and then make it 
a sheet 
you can probably get it down to half a sheet the message is a 
good one the message is the american people want change its 
just a question of refining the message a little bit 
cuomo said current concerns among democrats about dukakis losing 
the spotlight to republican rival george bush should disappear as 
the campaign continues 
to me the problem is very simple said cuomo you go 
to the republican convention they get the focus they look good 
and it public opinion swings back 
were still in the republican convention because of this 
ironic twist that bush running mate dan quayle kept the 
republicans in the mainstream with the light on them over 
questions about the indiana senators background

president reagan used recess appointments 
monday to fill two vacancies on the national labor relations board 
one with a veteran agency lawyer who was opposed by sen jesse 
helms and righttowork advocates 
reappointed by reagan to a fiveyear term expiring in august 
1993 was wilford w johansen a board member since 1985 and 
formerly head of the nlrbs regional office in los angeles 
also getting a recess appointment was john e higgins jr 48 
who as deputy general counsel was the highestranking nonpolitical 
appointee in the agency his term would expire in december 1992 
both johansen and higgins are republicans 
with a recess appointment while congress is not in session no 
senate confirmation is required however the appointments are 
effective only until the end of the next session of congress 
ending in january 1990 
reagan had nominated higgins last february to fill the seat left 
by the departure of donald dotson as the nlrbs chairman but the 
nomination had languished in the senate since then because of 
opposition from helms rnc and the national righttowork 
commmittee 
righttowork leaders opposed higgins because of his offices 
approval in 1986 of a contract between general motors and the 
united auto workers to use uaw members as the chief source of 
workers for gms new saturn auto plant in tennessee 
the appointments still leave the fivemember board with one 
vacancy after democrat marshall babsons resignation earlier this 
month to return to private law practice 
nlrb officials said they doubt babsons chair will be filled 
before the expiration of president reagans term in office jan 20

peace talks between iraq and iran faltered monday 
over the disputed shattalarab waterway iraqs only outlet to the 
sea with both nations foreign ministers staying away from the 
negotiations 
we are still at square one said iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz of the 4dayold negotiations we have not found any 
measure of good faith from the other side 
aziz charged iran with blocking the talks by refusing to allow 
the waterway to be cleared immediately the shattalarab has been 
blocked by sunken ships since the persian gulf war broke out in 
1980 
in new york meanwhile documents released at un headquarters 
disclosed a claim by iran that iraqi forces violated the truce that 
began aug 20 by killing an iranian soldier near abadan which is 
at the shattalarabs outlet to the gulf 
iran also claimed iraqi forces captured more than 650 other 
iranian troops on aug 23 in the presence of un military 
observers near the city of shush about 300 miles southwest of 
tehran 
the allegations were in a letter to the security council from 
irans charge daffaires mahmoud sadat madarshahi the iraqi 
commander denied capturing the men the letter said 
un spokeswoman nadia younes would not discuss the allegations 
and said they are being resolved and defused on the ground by the 
commander of the un iraniraq military observer group 
aziz and his iranian counterpart foreign minister ali akbar 
velayati did not attend mondays truce talks in geneva deciding 
to let aides do the work after the stalemate developed late sunday 
full ministerial talks tentatively set for monday night were 
postponed until tuesday at the earliest said francois giuliani 
spokesman for un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar who 
is mediating the talks 
the negotiations are continuing without underrating the 
difficulties that we face at the moment giuliani told reporters 
aziz told a news conference he was prepared to stay in geneva 
as long as the mission requires 
perez de cuellar said after six days of talks sunday that he was 
constantly putting forward ideas and building bridges between 
the two sides to keep talks going 
the aim of the talks is to turn a ceasefire that began aug 20 
into a lasting comprehensive settlement of the eightyear war that 
has claimed an estimated 1 million lives 
facetoface negotiations the first since war broke out were 
held thursday and friday they were suspended saturday for what 
perez de cuellar called a day of reflection 
aziz said the main sticking points in negotiations were irans 
refusal to agree to immediate clearing of the shattalarab under 
un supervision and its unwillingness to discuss details of 
ensuring freedom of navigation in the persian gulf 
velayati has dismissed iraqs insistence on dealing swiftly with 
the shattalarab issue as new preconditions 
he has said irans priorities in the talks are withdrawal of 
troops to international borders the exchange of prisoners of war 
and an inquiry to determine who started the fighting 
aziz told reporters that immediate clearing of the waterway 
would provide an equitable balance to iraqs accepting freedom 
of navigation for iranian ships in the persian gulf iraq has done 
so under the terms of the ceasefire 
iran already started using its ports along its long seashore 
for trade and it would be legitimate and logical for iraq 
also to benefit from the ceasefire aziz said 
he said perez de cuellar sympathizes with the iraqi position 
another key dispute is over a 1975 iraniraq treaty which sets 
the border down the middle of the 120mile shattalarab formed by 
the confluence of the euphrates and tigris rivers 
iraq which claims sovereignty over the waterway says the 
treaty has lapsed because of alleged iranian violations 
iran has said a treaty cannot be renounced by one side only and 
has charged iraq by undermining the talks with its stance 
resolution of the issue seems key to agreement on a troop 
withdrawal to international borders one of the points listed in a 
july 20 1987 un ceasefire resolution that forms the basis of 
the current peace talks 
iraqi deputy foreign minister saadoun hamadi on sunday 
reaffirmed his countrys claim in a toughly worded statement that 
cast doubt on progress at the talks 
aziz was also asked to respond to accusations monday by massoud 
barzani a leader of iraqi kurdish guerrillas that iraqi forces 
have injured and killed kurdish refugees in daily chemical bomb 
attacks this month 
i prefer not to comment on that he said that is a matter 
of the past and i like to concentrate on the future

animal rights activists are angry at a furriers 
group that has collected information about them and turned it over 
to the us justice department 
but a lawyer for a denver furrier who is being sued by the rocky 
mountain humane society says the group should have realized the 
repercussions when it erected billboards opposing the wearing of 
fur coats 
they initiated the controversy with their billboards 
attorney neil silver said monday they started it im not saying 
i agree with fourletter words being used over the telephone but 
they had to figure they were going to get some heat 
silver represents furrier dennis gene daily who is being 
sued by the humane society for allegedly harassing the organization 
by telephone silver said his client is innocent and only 
telephoned the humane society to ask for its address 
he even gave them his name silver said 
the society which says it is opposed to the use of animals 
for any purpose not truly in the animals interest has sponsored 
billboards and newspaper ads against fur coats 
silver noted one such billboard which shows a woman dragging a 
bloody fur coat behind her the billboard reads it takes up to 
40 dumb animals to make a fur coat but only one to wear it 
the link between the new yorkbased fur retailers information 
council and the justice department was revealed last week when the 
rocky mountain humane society asked daily in legal papers why he 
was seeking its address 
in court documents daily said the fur council had been asked by 
the federal government to divulge all information it receives 
from radical splinter groups who have passed themselves off as 
concerned individuals for animal rights 
in the documents daily said he wanted the information to aid 
in the prosecution of animal rights activists who have done damage 
to numerous businesses and incite public violence over truly 
nonexistent issues 
daily declined comment on the matter monday referring questions 
to his attorney 
silver said daily has filed a counterclaim against the humane 
society alleging libel and slander the lawsuit against daily is 
set for trial in district court in may 
tom rilney of the fur retailers information council said the 
justice department has asked us for any information that we have on 
the extremist groups and has encouraged us to have photographs 
taken of demonstrators in front of fur stores 
but jim carvino of the justice department said the furriers 
approached the justice department about two years ago about their 
concerns he said the government gave them general guidelines on 
how to collect information as it would any citizen seeking crime 
prevention tips 
carvino said he turns over information provided by furriers to 
the fbi the bureau would neither confirm nor deny whether animal 
rights groups are under investigation 
animal rights activists deny fur retailers accusations that 
they increasingly are using violence in their crusades 
denver lawyer rowe stanton who represents the rocky mountain 
humane society called the reports of information being sent to the 
fbi scary and outrageous 
he said the fur council has the impression that they have the 
implied consent of the united states government to gather 
information and that does bother me because they dont have to go 
by constitutional safeguards

an engineer who develops aerospace robotics is 
leading an effort to retrieve pioneer astronaut virgil gus 
grissoms mercury space capsule which sank at sea after splashdown 
more than 27 years ago 
i remember listening to those flights on the radio said 
curt newport of the early mercury project it would be something 
to finally come face to face with a piece of history 
newport 37 is seeking funding for the estimated 14 million 
salvage of the liberty bell 7 capsule off grand bahamas island 
about 300 miles southeast of cape canaveral 
when i started looking into this back in late 1984 i always 
thought that the most difficult part would be to convince people 
that it could be recovered said newport now im finding that 
the most difficult part is to locate someone willing to pay for 
it 
newport said sidescan sonar similar to those employed in 1985 
to locate the luxury liner titanic at a depth of 2 miles would be 
used to hunt for liberty bell 7 at a depth of about 1600 feet of 
water 
once the oneton capsule is found a manned submersible could 
attach a cable so it could be reeled to the surface he said 
newport has helped develop and operate underwater vehicles in 
salvage work such as the recovery of pieces of an air india jet 
that went down off ireland in 1985 and of the space shuttle 
challenger which exploded just after launch in january 1986 
grissoms craft splashed down july 21 1961 after about a 
15minute suborbital flight but when a navy helicopter hovered 
overhead explosive charges intended to open the hatch detonated 
prematurely and the capsule began to fill with water before divers 
could fit a flotation collar 
grissom swam to safety before the capsule sank 
some accounts including one in the novel and movie the right 
stuff suggest grissom panicked and blew the hatch himself the 
national aeronautics and space administration however absolved 
grissom of blame 
grissom and two other astronauts were killed when their apollo i 
capsule caught fire on the launch pad in 1967 
newport said even if the hatch is recovered it is unlikley it 
could provide clues to what happened before the capsules sinking 
its really an academic question he said our purpose is 
to recover a piece of space history we certainly are not out to 
make gus grissom look bad 
newport who lives in annapolis md and works for a nasa 
subcontractor helping design robotics for the planned us space 
station said nasa officials do not seem to have a great interest 
in studying the capsule 
they havent said dont look for it but its of very 
limited value to them said newport it seems more appropriate 
in a museum or someplace where people can come look at it 
nasa officials in washington dc and at the kennedy space 
center did not respond to telephone messages seeking reaction to 
newports plans

president daniel ortega on monday 
extended a fivemonth ceasefire with nicaraguan rebels until the 
end of september 
he also called on the presidents of el salvador costa rica 
guatemala and honduras to resume talks on a central american peace 
plan ortega and the four other presidents last met in january 
the nicaraguan government extends until sept 30 the halt to 
offensive military operations so the rebels can put down their 
arms and accept amnesty ortega said in a speech to a group of 
indian leaders in managua 
the rebels known as contras and the sandinista government 
first agreed to a ceasefire on march 21 two days later they 
signed a pact agreeing to negotiate an end to the the 7yearold 
war 
ortegas extension was the fourth of a formal 60day truce that 
took effect april 1 the usbacked contras said in june they 
would observe the ceasefire indefinitely 
both sides have accused the other of violating the truce 
a series of political talks to negotiate a permanent ceasefire 
and pave the way for a peace settlement broke off june 9 
under the regional peace plan signed by the five central 
american presidents in august 1987 the contras would lay down 
their arms in exchange for concrete democratic measures by the 
sandinistas 
there were these other developments 
two nicaraguan politicians left managua monday and went to 
miami to discuss with contra leaders the release of political 
prisoners 
erick ramirez and mauricio diaz are members of the national 
reconciliation commission set up under last years peace plan 
ramirez said one issue is the fate of 75 sandinista soldiers 
held by the contras as prisoners of war he said the rebels 
acknowledge holding the soldiers and have agreed to free them but 
details must be worked out 
ramirez also said he had a list of names of more than 600 
nicaraguans whose whereabouts are unknown 
the archbishop of managua in an interview broadcast on the 
vatican citys radio station said human rights violations are 
continuing in nicaragua despite the ceasefire 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo said as for the war the 
fighting has diminished but there are still unfortunately deaths 
on both sides human rights violations continue and we are working 
as men christians and pastors so that life is protected 
the truce has saved lives he added but many things have 
not been realized in my opinion what is lacking is the 
fundamental thing full democracy

us and soviet negotiators held preliminary 
meetings monday for a third round of talks they say could lead to 
ratification of two treaties worked out in the 1970s to limit 
nuclear tests 
c paul robinson the us delegation chief and his soviet 
counterpart igor palenykh met at the us mission monday to discuss 
administrative details us spokesman art skop said the first 
plenary session was expected to be held later this week 
both chief negotiators arrived saturday in separate airport 
news conferences they expressed optimism that this round will 
produce verification protocols for the 1970 treaties that have been 
signed but not ratified 
in santa barbara calif white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said monday we are making good progress toward our goal 
palenykh said saturday that this round should become a 
milestone event in the dialogue between the ussr and the united 
states on this important problem of nuclear disarmament 
verification or anticheating protocols being considered in 
the negotiation are for the 1974 threshold test ban treaty and the 
1976 peaceful nuclear explosions treaty both limit underground 
nuclear test explosions to a strength of 150 kilotons of tnt 
the two superpowers say they abide by the unratified agreements 
but the united states has said it will not ratify the documents 
until they contain adequate provisions against cheating 
robinson told reporters saturday that president reagan had said 
he would like the treaties ratified before he leaves office next 
january 
the protocols would be attached to the treaties not changing 
the language and would include a menu of accepted monitoring 
techniques either side could use to measure nuclear tests and 
verify compliance robinson said 
us and soviet specialists held a joint experiment aug 17 in 
nevada where soviet officials watched a us nuclear test for the 
first time and monitored it with their own equipment 
a similar test is scheduled for sept 14 at the soviet unions 
semipalatinsk testing range 
expert level discussions on nuclear testing began in july 
1986 and formal negotiations started last november 
while both sides agree the first priority is the verification 
protocols they still apparently disagree about the step after that 
the soviets want immediate negotiations on a complete nuclear 
test ban washington says nuclear tests are necessary while nuclear 
weapons exist in order to ensure their quality and wants tests 
reduced in tandem with arms stockpiles

a leader of rebel kurds in iraq accused 
turkey on monday of closing its border to thousands of kurdish 
refugees fleeing chemical bomb attacks by iraqs military 
massoud barzani chairman of the kurdish democratic party one 
of the main groups fighting for ethnic autonomy said in a 
statement that 500 kurds were killed and 3000 wounded in iraqi 
attacks this month 
a foreign ministry official in turkey said the border was not 
closed but his government had taken security measures he did 
elaborate but observers assumed that meant keeping kurds from 
slipping across the frontier 
barzanis statement in english was dictated to the associated 
press in nicosia by a spokesman for his group the spokesman would 
not give his name citing security reasons 
turkey has closed its borders with iraq and denied refuge to 
tens of thousands of kurdish refugees the statement said adding 
that the kurds were fleeing as a result of daily chemical attacks 
and are assembling at the border opposite the town of cucurca in 
the hakari province they include several hundred people injured by 
poison gas 
many especially children are dying daily of chemical burns 
hunger and cold weather as they wait barzani said the 
environment and food stuffs have been contaminated by poison gas 
there are fears of epidemic and starvation we appeal to the 
turkish government to allow in at least the chemically injured 
children and women on humanitarian grounds 
about 10 million of turkeys 55 million people are kurds and 35 
million kurds live in northern iraq a total of 20 million inhabit 
the mountainous area where the borders of turkey iraq iran syria 
and the soviet union converge and their fight for autonomy has 
spanned generations 
a kurdish marxist group known as the kurdish labor party has 
fought the army in southeast turkey since 1984 about 700 people 
have died on each side 
turkey and iraq have an agreement under which their forces may 
penetrate 6 miles into each others territory in pursuit of kurdish 
rebels iraq has not used the option but turkey has done so three 
times in recent years twice to bomb guerrilla camps 
the barzani statement accused iraq of a fullscale chemical 
and physical slaughter of the kurds he asked un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar the international 
committee of the red cross and the un high commissioner for 
refugees to urge the government of turkey to offer refuge to our 
people 
iraqi chemical attacks continued and intensified friday and 
saturday in the zakho amadiyah and sheikhan districts the 
statement said with warplanes dropping chemical bombs while 
artillery and tank cannon shelled villages 
barzani claimed a fierce battle was under way in the dahok 
mosul and irbil districts between iraqi soldiers and kurdish 
guerrillas known as peshmergas or those who face death 
western diplomats in baghdad say privately the scale of iraqs 
crackdown on its kurds many of whom were allied with iran grew 
when a truce began aug 20 in the 8yearold persian gulf war 
in ankara the turkish foreign ministry spokesman said it is 
natural for turkey to take measures considered necessary for its 
security turkey is behaving now as in the past in complete 
awareness of its international obligations 
diplomats said that was a reference to the 1951 geneva 
convention on refugees they said turkey in signing the 
convention stipulated that it would use its own discretion in 
admitting refugees from countries outside europe 
turkey has allowed hundreds of thousands of people fleeing 
irans fundamentalist islamic republic to travel west through its 
territory and about 600000 iranian refugees remain in turkey

iran claims iraqi forces violated the 
persian gulf truce by capturing hundreds of iranian soldiers as 
un military observers looked on according to documents released 
monday 
the tehran government accused iraq of numerous violations of the 
ceasefire that began aug 20 according to a letter to the 
security council from irans charge daffaires mahmoud sadat 
madarshahi 
as we said very early on we wont discuss the substance of 
any violations said un spokeswoman nadia younes they are 
being resolved and defused on the ground by the commander of the 
un iraniraq military observer group 
madarshahis letter also said that on thursday an iranian 
military personnel was hit by an iraqi bullet and martyred near 
abadan which is at the shatt alarab waterways outlet to the gulf 
the letter said that on aug 23 un military observers saw 
iraqi forces capture 69 officers and 597 soldiers in two incidents 
about 300 miles southwest of tehran near the city of shush 
the iraqi commander denied capturing the men the letter said 
irans letter said iraqi forces withdrew to their own lines from 
the sharhanichamsari area near einkhosh and dezful about 290 
miles south of tehran after consulting with un observers aug 23 
the iranian letter contained numerous allegations of iraqi 
maneuvers on the 730mile front line which it said violated the 
ceasefire 
in baghdad the official iraqi news agency on monday leveled 
countercharges saying iranian soldiers approached iraqi positions

junior high and high schools for the new school year affecting 
about 100000 palestinian youngsters school was supposed to begin 
thursday but an army spokesman said junior highs would reopen two 
weeks late and high schools oct 1 
earlier this month the army delayed reopening west bank schools 
attended by about 300000 students until at least oct 1 
israel says the schools are rallying points for student protest 
which is at the core of the rebellion among the 15 million 
palestinians in the occupied lands 
at least 255 palestinians have been killed since the uprising 
began dec 8 in the territories israel captured from jordan and 
egypt in the 1967 war four israelis also have been slain 
in nablus the largest city in the west bank soldiers shot 
bilal shabi 42 in the chest when he emerged from his house during 
a curfew according to israel radio and officials at mukassad 
hospital 
a neighbor said shabi came to his house early monday to use the 
phone to call an ambulance for his 10yearold son kayed who had 
a lung infection 
then he went down to wait for the ambulance so the driver 
wouldnt get lost the neighbor told the associated press 
speaking on condition of anonymity shabi lives in the old section 
of the city a crowded quarter of narrow alleys that often are 
unmarked 
officials at another hospital tulkarem said a palestinian from 
nearby bala village was wounded in the left arm and right leg when

naked cover himself with paint and stand in the sun for hours 
then soldiers clubbed him to remove the dried paint flakes 
the army denied the allegations this never happened an 
army official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
another prisoner khaled youssef moussa 28 said troops tied 
his hands and feet so he had to stand bent over backward in what 
inmates call the banana position 
a parliamentary debate was held about ketziot where about 2500 
palestinians are held many for up to six months without trial 
legislators rejected a motion to close the prison and 
investigate the deaths of two palestinian detainees killed by 
soldiers in a prison riot earlier in august

the mayor of the siberian village of dickson 
said monday that his stay in this soundalike town that was 
president reagans boyhood home has been an eyeopener and that he 
no longer equates greed with the average american 
mayor nikolai t kartamyshev and two other soviet citizens bid 
farewell after a busy week promoting goodwill touring businesses 
and establishing sistercity ties 
if my impressions havent changed 180 degrees to the other 
side kartamyshev said through an intrepreter then they have 
changed to a very great extent 
the siberian official told a news conference he was brought up 
to believe a caricature of americansbut now he no longer thinks 
of americans as fat bureaucrats dressed in black suits with 
dollar sign symbols on their stomachs he said 
kartamyshev and officials of dixon about 100 miles west of 
chicago signed a document at the news conference cementing their 
sistercity status 
this community of 15700 wellknown because of its ties to 
reagan was chosen by kartamyshev after he read about its economic 
problems he contacted officials in dixon in early 1987 about 
forming ties 
in his first overtures kartamyshev expressed fear of world war 
because of reagans evil empire rhetoric 
but when he arrived in dixon last thursday kartamyshev praised 
reagans efforts to ease world tensions 
the idea of a smalltown goodwill meeting came from dixon mayor 
james e dixon a descendant of the towns founder who invited his 
soviet counterpart to the united states for a visit 
he said he believed a cultural exchange between the nations is a 
key to reagans efforts to bring the superpowers closer together 
the highlight of the dicksontodixon summit was thursday when 
the three soviets toured the modest twostory whiteframe house 
where reagan lived as a 9yearold boy in 1920 crowds gathered 
wearing peace on earth buttons in english and russian 
i have written in the special guest book inside that a great 
man deserved a great memory and i am happy to be at such a special 
place kartamyshev said as the group left the threebedroom house 
there are a lot of great men who have come from small and 
ordinary places he said 
reagan was born in nearby tampico in 1911 and lived in several 
dixon houses with his parents jack and nelle and older brother 
neil from 1920 until he left for college in 1928 
the remote frontier village of dickson population 5000 is on 
the taimry peninsula in extreme northern siberia above the arctic 
circle 
kartamyshev wrote last spring that every letter from dixon is 
a remarkable event in our small town 
dickson was named for oskar dickson a 19thcentury swedish 
merchant who provided supplies for early expeditions by arctic 
explorers it generally is closed to foreign visitors because of 
nearby military installations 
dixon was founded by the mayors greatgreatgreatgrandfather 
john dixon as a rock river ferryboat crossing in 1830 abraham 
lincoln was stationed at fort dixon at age 23 during the black 
hawk war and there met jefferson davis his future civil war 
adversary

the smogclogged los angeles basin will fail 
to meet federal clean air standards well into the 21st century 
despite a ban on major new pollution sources the areas air 
quality chief said monday 
the environmental protection agency announced plans monday to 
block construction of facilities that would emit more than 100 tons 
of carbon monoxide or ozone pollutants a year as a congressional 
moratorium on such sanctions expires 
the move came as no surprise to james m lents executive 
officer of the south coast air quality management district who 
said the ban would do nothing to reduce smog in the nations most 
populous urban area 
weve known for some time that if congress didnt act the 
construction ban would go into effectsaid lents who oversees 
smog eradication efforts in los angeles orange san bernardino and 
riverside counties 
but he said the epa ban only affects those seeking to build 
heavy duty sources of pollution on the magnitude of oil refineries 
powergenerating plants or automotive factories and that no such 
facilities are planned for the region 
based on the permit applications weve received this year and 
last the ban will have absolutely no effect on smog abatement in 
the short run lents said adding that it will take at least 20 
years to clear southern california smog to acceptable levels 
the epa announcement followed a saturday air pollution 
summit at city hall organized by the coalition for clean air 
campaign california a group brought together by state assemblyman 
tom hayden 
among other proposals speakers called for tight controls on 
urban growth to help clear smogburdened skies 
i dont think it goes after the problem hayden said in a 
telephone interview from sacramento but certainly the pressure 
of the federal government has to be welcome 
los angeles has intolerable levels of air pollution im told 
current smog levels will expose everybody in the basin to toxic 
pollution 200 to 300 percent above acceptable health standards 
he said 
the los angeles basin comes under the epa sanctions slated to 
take effect at midnight tuesday because the air pollution control 
plan it submitted to the agency was rejected 
a lawsuit brought by environmentalists resulted in a january 
federal court order requiring the epa to reject the los angeles 
plan because it failed to bring regional air quality into 
compliance with the 10year deadline set by the 1977 clean air act 
lents said 
the epa maintains that the law permits penalties only for 
failure to submit and follow plans there is no penalty for failure 
to meet the standards if an agencyapproved control plan did not 
work out 
but since los angeles has no approved plan on file with the 
agency it falls under the federal sanctions 
los angeles was one of about 100 metropolitan areas that the epa 
said missed last decembers deadline to contain smog at acceptable 
levels 
lents said his agency will present a draft of a new 20year smog 
reduction plan at a sept 9 meeting with approval by the air 
quality management district board expected in december it would 
then go to the epa for final approval 
the new plan features stricter measures to regulate and 
prosecute polluters and broadens existing operations like using 
california highway patrol officers to get vehicles spewing illegal 
exhaust off the road he said 
special targets will be fuel refineries furniture manufacturers 
and auto painting shops within eight years it is hoped those 
emissions can be reduced 90 percent he said

the disease that has killed more 
than 11000 seals in western europes coastal waters is caused by a 
virus common in domestic dogs a dutch biologist said monday 
but there is little man can do to stop the disease from 
spreading and up to 80 percent of the seals in the north sea and 
kattegat waters between denmark and sweden might eventually die 
according to ab osterhaus 
canine distemper virus or a closely related virus is the 
primary cause of the seal deaths osterhaus told a news 
conference in this northern dutch village that has western europes 
largest seal nursery 
the virus causes infections of the respiratory and central 
nervous systems and the digestive tracts osterhaus said there is 
no specific cure for seals that have the virus 
there is a possibility the virus spread to seals when one was 
bitten by a dog said osterhaus of the dutch national institute for 
popular health and environmental protection 
specialists in western europe who have been investigating the 
seal deaths have speculated pollution has played a role in the 
killer epidemic 
osterhaus said antibodies to canine distemper virus were found 
in all of the dead seals he examined 
the development of these antibodies coincided clearly with the 
surfacing of symptoms of the disease he said 
a similar report was made at a news conference monday in 
stockholm sweden by patholigist anders bergman of stockholm 
universitys veterinary school he said he began suspecting in june 
that the canine distemper virus was linked to the seal deaths 
bengt klingeborn a virologist at the veterinary school said he 
believed the 25 percent of western european seals that have 
survived so far will live through the epidemic because they have 
developed antibodies 
osterhaus noted there had been an outbreak of the canine 
distemper virus among dogs in greenland shortly before the epidemic 
erupted among seals early this year each summer thousands of seals 
migrate from greenland to western european waters 
osterhaus said his team had developed an experimental vaccine 
against the canine distemper virus but added it will not be 
possible to carry out preventive vaccinations in the wild 
he said research is still being conducted to determine if the 
massive pollution of western european waters could have accelerated 
the epidemic by weakening the seals immune systems 
we know that certain substances we find in the seas today 
can affect the immune system he said pollution may have 
triggered the thing but it was not the cause as such 
sweden has reported 3400 dead seals denmark nearly 3000 west 
germany 3900 norway 600 and the netherlands 175

iran has repaired its salman oil platform 
in the persian gulf after the rig was shelled by us warships and 
has boosted its overall oil production to 200000 barrels a day an 
official said monday 
oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh on tehran radio monitored in 
nicosia that the platform is producing 50000 barrels a day 
about 35 percent of its capacity and that iran plans to boost its 
production to 160000 barrels a day 
the official islamic republic news agency meanwhile reported 
monday that a pipeline had been completed between bandar anzali on 
the caspian sea and rasht 
the iranian news agency said refined oil products from the 
soviet union will be offloaded at bandar anzali and piped to 
rasht where they will be distributed to other parts of iran 
iran though a major oil producer lost much of its refining 
capacity to iraqi air raids 
us warships pounded the salman and nasr platforms in the 
southern gulf on april 18 in retaliation for the mining of the 
us frigate samuel b roberts 
us navy shellfire on oct 19 badly damaged two other iranian 
platforms in the gulf rakhsh and rostam in retaliation for an 
iranian missile attack on the usflagged kuwaitowned tanker sea 
isle city near kuwaits alahmadi loading terminal 
at that time iran estimated damage to those two platforms at 
500 million 
aqazadeh made no mention monday of the other damaged platforms 
but iran has said that following the aug 20 ceasefire in the 
8yearold war with iraq it plans to repair the damaged oil 
installations with maximum speed 
irans prewar offshore production was an estimated 500000 
barrels a day by 1986 damage from iraqi attacks had halved that 
level

a west germanowned ship believed to be carrying 
2100 tons of highly toxic chemical waste is anchored off south 
england and is being closely monitored a government minister said 
monday 
the motor vessel karin b was believed to be carrying poisonous 
waste which came from italy and had been dumped illegally in 
nigeria according to the environmental group friends of the earth 
junior environment minister virginia bottomley said britain 
plans to contact italian authorities to hear their proposals for 
the waste 
she said it was in nobodys interest to have footloose cargoes 
of dangerous wastes drifting the seas of the world searching for a 
port of call what matters most is that this cargo should be 
disposed of safely in carefully supervised conditions 
mrs bottomley said the ship was under close surveillance and 
that she would hold an urgent meeting tuesday to review the 
situation 
the karin b was spotted monday morning anchored eight miles off 
eddystone lighthouse about 20 miles south of plymouth said a 
spokesman for the department of environment who by custom was not 
identified 
as yet it hasnt made any approach to any of the 
harbormasters of the local ports so were waiting to see what 
their next move will be the spokesman said 
the ship was refused permission friday to enter neath south 
wales 
friends of the earth spokesman andrew lees said the cargo 
includes highly inflammable solvents corrosive liquids and 
cancercausing chemicals 
nigeria ordered italy to remove the waste from an illegal dump 
at koko on the banks of the niger river the italian government 
chartered the karin b but claimed italy lacked the facilities to 
dispose of the toxic waste lees said 
spain and west germany have refused to take the waste and the 
ship was refused a berth at neath because the port was too shallow 
lees said 
he said britain has become an international destination for 
toxic waste because of its lax environmental laws

moslem theologians ruled monday that saboteurs and terrorists can 
be punished by execution the death sentence in the saudi kingdom 
is carried out by beheading by sword 
the council is the supreme authority on the interpretation of 
islamic judicial matters 
after a fourday meeting in taif the council issued its 
decisions that were distributed by the official saudi press agency 
the lengthy statement referred to saboteurs and those who 
spread corruption on earth it specifically mentioned hijacking 
and acts of sabotage against oil installations both recurrent acts 
of terrorism against countries in the region 
the council statement said its decision was based on a number 
of acts of sabotage which have cost the lives of many innocent 
people caused damage to much properties and finances and public 
institutions in many islamic and other countries carried out by 
the poor of faith or those who lack it altogether sick and envious 
elements

a state circuit judge ruled monday that the 
citys white mayor won a seventh term thwarting three black 
members of the city council who had refused to certify the victory 
cleophus mann one of the black councilmen and the runnerup to 
mayor joe smitherman in the aug 23 election said he would appeal 
the decision in federal court and also challenge the certified 
results in dallas county circuit court 
i intend to challenge it election until something happens 
where i can show my side mann said monday night referring to 
his claim that smitherman stole the election 
circuit judge charles thigpen ruled in response to a lawsuit by 
smitherman that the mayor should be certified as the winner based 
on results that showed him defeating mann 3752 to 2769 votes a 
third candidate coy darby had 453 votes 
smithermans reelection vote totals set off an angry reaction 
by manns followers last week including the arrest of two on 
charges of disorderly conduct 
the mayor said he was not surprised by the judges ruling 
i had expected it because there was no grounds for the city 
council not to certify it said smitherman a former 
segregationist who was first elected in 1964 one year before the 
selmatomontgomery civil rights march focused national attention 
on the city 
i guess he mann figured whoever could get out in the middle 
of the street and holler the loudest would get elected the mayor 
said 
smitherman had asked thigpen to certify the election so 
preparations could begin for a sept 13 runoff election to fill 
seven seats on a new ninemember city council 
the current sixmember panel was deadlocked over whether to 
certify the results of tuesdays election with three black members 
voting against certification and three white members voting in 
favor 
smitherman saying he was the straw man in a battle for the 
leadership of selmas black community accused mann of intimidating 
the other two black councilmen into voting against certification 
attorney jl chestnut who represented black councilmen lorenzo 
harrison and edwin moss said his clients were not going to vote 
to certify with or without a court order now if the judge wants 
to thats his business 
chestnut said none of the mayoral candidates addressed the 
burning issue in this town which is racism 
everything over here is racial he said in an interview 
after mondays court hearing whites turn out to vote only when 
the white political leadership anticipates a large black turnout 
they knew that was not going to be the case 
smitherman however disputed that race should have been the 
major issue in the mayors campaign 
selma has made tremendous racial progress he said pointing 
to the appointment of a black schools superintendent by a 
predominately white school board 
manns supporters claimed the race was closer than the official 
tabulation and that there were irregularities at polling places 
they said smitherman led mann by only 3043 to 2743 with darby 
third at 453 those results would have forced a runoff between mann 
and smitherman

two senators conclude in a new book that vice 
president george bush endorsed the sale of weapons to iran they 
say he did so either out of loyalty to president reagan or because 
he too was consumed with the idea of freeing american 
hostages 
noting that the issue remains important because of bushs 
quest for the presidency sens william s cohen rmaine and 
george mitchell dmaine say the central question is exactly 
what were his thoughts about the propriety of the covert action

the international committee of the red cross was 
pressured by its vice president and the swiss government during 
world war ii into keeping silent on the massacre of jews by the 
nazis a swiss historian says 
the charge comes from professor jeanclaude favez who was 
invited by the genevabased red cross to examine its wartime 
records and settle the holocaust controversy that still shadows the 
125yearold organization 
red cross directorgeneral jacques moreillon who played a key 
role in opening the files to favez six years ago says the 
historians verdict stems from hindsight and that a public appeal 
by the red cross over the massacres of european jews would have 
jeopardized its humanitarian work in nazi germany

the environmental protection agency said 
monday it is banning construction of new facilities in greater los

extended to a dozen other us cities this fall 
the epa is legally required to move against los angeles because 
an eightmonth moratorium on pollution penalties expires at 
midnight tuesday congress imposed the moratorium last december to 
give itself more time to revise and clarify the clean air act 
but negotiations over revising the law are stalled by

asian airports have tightened security to prevent 
acts of terrorism during the summer olympics in south korea this 
month 
authorities in japan taiwan southeast asia and all the way to 
australia in addition to south korea itself are clamping down on 
possible threats they believe could come from communist north 
korea the japanese red army south korean radicals or a host of 
other quarters 
experts in terrorism are justified in concerning themselves 
with every eventuality and every precaution should be taken to 
preclude any threat no matter what the source edward derwinski 
us undersecretary of state for security assistance said recently 
in washington 
amid fears that terrorists could try to enter south korea from 
japan airports throughout japan have intensified checks of 
passengers and their baggage frisking individuals twice and 
sending them through two metal detectors before boarding planes 
japanese authorities have deployed special xray machines that 
can detect plastic explosives and immigration and customs 
personnel have been increased to check of passports and carryon 
baggage 
japanese airlines are stepping up inspections of liquor bottles 
as explosives in such a liquor bottle were believed responsible for 
the destruction of a korean air jetliner near burma in november 
killing 115 people a selfconfessed north korean agent said she 
planted the explosives on board to disrupt the sept 17oct 2 
summer games in seoul and presidential elections in south korea 
last year 
armed guards have been assigned to ferries operating between 
japan and south korea and japans coast guard is deploying some 80 
percent of its patrol boats and planes to the sea of japan to 
thwart potential smuggling of explosives and weapons into south 
korea 
several known or suspected japanese red army members have been 
arrested in recent months some travelling on false passports one 
of them osamu maruoka was carrying a oneway ticket to seoul 
south koreas capital 
he may have intended to set up a new cell there or to work 
with one already in existence to stage terrorist attacks in south 
korea in conjunction with the olympic games said the us state 
departments annual report on terrorism 
the philippine military is closely watching airports to detect 
terrorists and immigration officials are carefully scrutinizing 
entry of korean nationals 
it is a cooperative effort among the countries in this part of 
the world to prevent the movement of known and identified 
terrorists who may attempt to go to korea and conduct terrorism 
the philippines military chief of staff gen renato de villa said 
police arrested one red army member in manila this year who had 
undergone radical plastic surgery and others are suspected of 
living in the philippines for several years posters of suspected 
red army members are displayed at manilas airport as well as at 
airports in other asian countries 
thailand began antiterrorist measures aug 1 by deploying air 
force commandos and a tank at don muang international airport 
according to airport general manager charoon peetong authorities 
are exchanging information with other international agencies to 
monitor potential threats charoon said 
other airports such as sukarnohatta in jakarta indonesia 
subang in kuala lumpur malaysia chiang kaishek in taipei 
taiwan singapores changi hong kongs kai tak and australian 
airports have no new measures and are relying on what they feel 
are sufficient precautions at kai tak in hong kong machine 
guntoting commandos routinely make patrols 
none of the measures rival those taken in south korea itself 
where authorities fear reprisals from neighboring north korea after 
its pleas to cohost the summer games were rejected by the 
international olympic committee 
at seouls kimpo airport which has a reputation for some of the 
strictest security at any commercial airport passengers must go 
through metal detectors when leaving planes troops in full battle 
gear patrol regularly and huge searchlights pan nearby fields at 
night since november soldiers with submachine guns have been 
patrolling kimpos departure lobby 
the threat at kimpo was highlighted in 1986 when a few days 
before the opening of the asian games a bomb went off killing 
five people seoul blamed north korea for that attack 
south korea is also concerned by north koreas recent deployment 
of surfacetoair missiles capable of hitting planes flying near 
kimpo 
korean air bans passengers from bringing aboard liquor bottles 
except dutyfree alcohol or batteries

with its chalets pine 
forests and oompah band san vigilio seems like any other tyrolian 
town except for the littleknown language its people speak 
san vigilio is a home of the ladins a tiny group of mountain 
people clinging to a language traced to the ancient romans who 
conquered the valleys in what are now italys eastern alps 
the ladins are officially recognized as the third language group 
of the alto adige a part of italy that used to be austrias south 
tyrol 
as a minority ladins also speak german and italian the other 
two official languages and they have tried to steer clear of the 
ethnic problems between those two groups 
we are a minority competing with two foreign tongues said 
lois craffonara director of a ladin cultural institute we are 
different because of our language 
so far the ladinspeaking valleys in the dolomites some 90 
miles north of venice have been spared the bombing campaign blamed 
on germanspeaking extremists seeking autonomy for the province 
that was ceded to italy after world war i 
thirteen bombs attributed to the extremists have gone off since 
march but none have caused deaths or serious injuries 
the ladins number only 18000 in the alto adige in contrast to 
280000 germanspeakers and 124000 italianspeakers 
there are 12000 ladins in two other dolomite provinces trento 
and belluno and an estimated 50000 in switzerland according to 
craffonara but only in the alto adige has there been an official 
census 
the ladins include some of italys top skiers alpine guides and 
woodcraftsmen as well as two names known outside italy maria 
canins a crosscountry skier and cyclist considered one of the 
worlds leading women athletes and hollywood composersongwriter 
giorgio moroder winner of three academy awards 
ladin is classified as belonging to the rhaetian group of 
romance languages the isolation of the ladins in the mountainous 
area has allowed the language to survive invasions through the 
centuries the local hero caterina lanz used a pitchfork to 
drive out french soldiers hiding in a cemetery in 1797 
but the isolation has also hindered the languages spread ladin 
speakers in san vigilio would receive blank stares if they used 
their language in the next valley only a 15minute drive over a 
mountain pass 
ladin sounds like a mixture of french and latin it is 
considered a sister language of french provencal catalan and 
italian 
craffonara and other experts say it has a rich vocabulary 
although purists have lamented that modern words have crept into 
the language 
one major problem is the lack of a ladin dictionary each valley 
speaks a slightly different version and experts have been unable to 
agree on a unified vocabulary 
but ladin speakers have been making gains in recent years 
the first major roman catholic prayer book in ladin was 
published only in 1984 and italys staterun raitv network just 
this summer began broadcasting longpromised news and cultural 
programs in the language on its regional channel 
the biweekly newspaper usc di ladins voice of the ladins 
greeted the move with the headline finalmenter finally 
further recognition came when pope john paul ii visited the area 
in july and spoke in ladin as well as german and italian 
still ladins complain that only in the alto adige have they 
received any guarantees 
by law ladin is taught in the public schools in ladin villages 
and at least one seat on the provincial council in bolzano is set 
aside for them 
and benefitting from the strict ethnic guidelines in the 
province they are also guaranteed their share of government jobs 
under a quota system put into effect to ensure that german speakers 
keep the upper hand over the italian speakers in the area 
under the regime of benito mussolini the italian dictator who 
ruled italy from 1922 and into world war ii the ladins suffered 
alongside the german speakers 
the ladin valleys which had been united under the 
austrianhungarian empire were divided up into different 
provinces while the speaking of german was forbidden and even 
names on gravestones were italianized ladin was considered no more 
than an italian dialect and ladin speakers were encouraged to 
emigrate elsewhere in italy 
today the ladin areas are major tourist centers attracting in 
particular skiers and hikers up to now there have only been 
scattered ethnic incidents involving the painting over of the 
italian names on road signs or the puncturing of tires of some cars 
of italian tourists

changes in adoption laws designed to 
curb illegal baby trade have restricted the ability of 
foreigners to adopt filipino youngsters and may mean that many will 
spend their childhood in orphanages 
new regulations which took effect aug 3 ban adoptions of 
filipino children by foreigners residing in the country unless at 
least one prospective parent is related to the child 
foreigners living abroad can still adopt filipino children 
through international agencies but prospective parents living here 
will have to return to their own country and file papers there 
through an international agency 
the procedure can take years depending on the adoption laws in 
the country where the papers are filed 
government figures indicate that in recent years about 17 
percent of the 2500 children adopted here annually have been taken 
by foreigners residing in the philippines and who were not related 
to the child 
more than a third of all adoptions of filipino children are by 
foreigners including those who file papers abroad and would not be 
affected by the changes 
the new code is not antiforeigner said lourdes balanon 
assistant director of the governments bureau of child and youth 
welfare it is an effort by the government to protect our 
children 
ms balanon said that in the past foreigners could adopt 
filipino children in a few weeks previous regulations allowed 
single foreigners to adopt with much less red tape than in the 
united states or other countries 
ms balanon added that although many of the adoptive foreign 
parents were of good character others may have been fronts for 
baby trading selling youngsters to couples abroad who were 
unable to have children 
mothers were convinced to give up their children and even 
kidnapping may have been encouraged she said 
because local adoptions usually were arranged without the 
services of an international agency the government here had no way 
of ensuring the childs welfare once the parents left the country 
but some welfare workers fear the new regulations will 
discourage legitimate adoptions by qualified foreign families 
living in a country without a tradition of taking in children who 
are not related to those who adopt them 
in filipino society adoption of children with no blood ties is 
rare government figures show that in the past two years only 5 
percent of the children adopted here were taken by filipino couples 
who were not related by blood 
traditionally orphans and children of impoverished parents 
unable to care for them become the responsibility of the extended 
family uncles aunts cousins and grandparents 
but children born out of wedlock are often kept secret from 
their families 
abortion is technically illegal and birth control is frequently 
shunned in this predominantly roman catholic country unwed mothers 
find themselves under tremendous social pressure to turn their 
infants over to religious or government orphanages 
in other cases extended families sometimes are too poor to take 
in another child 
older children will be especially affected said lisa 
hechenova of the asilio de san vincente de paul orphange in manila 
because if filipinos adopt at all they want infants foreigners 
are more inclined to accept toddlers and even 6to10year olds 
jose a 3yearold toddler at manilas hospicio de san jose 
orphanage is one of those children who because of new 
regulations may never have a home he has been at the orphanage 
for more than eight months because officials have had difficulty 
finding him a home and the new changes in the law will make it even 
more difficult 
sevenyearold maria was among the last children adopted by a 
resident foreign couple she was given in july to a european couple 
maria said she never knew her natural parents 
but i used to dream about them every night only they didnt 
have faces

catapulted into prominence as a center of 
international business tokyo is undergoing major transformations 
aimed at relieving its congestion lack of affordable housing and 
shortage of office space 
urban planners are focusing on skyscrapers and manmade islands 
in tokyo bay as ways to modernize and open up vast areas to 
development especially for foreign firms clamoring for a place to 
do business 
the plans some bold some bizarre all urgent are designed 
to provide business and living space and to hold down soaring land 
prices 
in tokyo bay builders are already working on a futuristic 
businessresidential district on manmade islands one of some 40 
projects under way or planned for the bay 
several new subways and aboveground railways are worming their 
way toward the jammed city center blueprints are being drawn for 
massive waterfront development and one firm plans to create a 
floating office building out of a 35000ton ship 
the tokyo metropolitan government is moving across town opening 
up some choice downtown real estate 
the national government is seriously studying moving its 
bureaucracy out of tokyo possibly creating a new capital city 
twelve million people live in tokyos city limits while greater 
tokyo groans with 30 million people a quarter of japans 
population in 2 percent of its area 
theres just not enough space says osamu homma a spokesman 
for mitsubishi estate japans secondlargest real estate 
developer buildings are taking up more of tokyo and residents 
are getting kicked out 
the city called edo in feudal japan was made the capital in 
1868 it grew rapidly but was virtually levelled by a severe 
earthquake in 1923 and destroyed again by us bombers in world 
war ii 
it was rebuilt largely along its previous layout with winding 
twisting roads that had deterred enemy attacks in old days on the 
shoguns castle in the city center 
today tokyo is a labyrinth of nameless streets and tiny oneway 
lanes few houses have gardens and parking is a perennial headache 
with tokyos rapid growth as an international 
financeinformation center on a par with new york and london space 
has become its most prized commodity 
central tokyo land prices skyrocketed 966 percent last year 
with choice downtown land selling for the equivalent of 67 
billion an acre wiping out any dream the average tokyoite might 
have of owning a house in the city 
businesses and people are concentrated too much together 
says tokyo city planner toshihiko ogata they must spread out to 
other areas 
a plan gaining popularity is literally moving the capital out of 
tokyo 
a pet project of prime minister noboru takeshita is 
decentralization and the government has ordered 79 public offices 
to leave tokyo eventually all ministries could pack their bags and 
open up lowrise downtown tokyo to highrise development 
the city government however backs the most ambitious scheme to 
be initiated so far the sleek tokyo teleport now being built 
on 1107 acres of manmade islands in tokyo bay just 37 miles 
from downtown it is to be finished by the year 2000 and cost 318 
billion 
the islands will be studded with intelligent buildings with 
stateoftheart automation communications and 
informationretrieval systems hotels and sports and shopping 
plazas it will provide homes for 60000 people and offices for 
110000 
kisho kurokawa a prominent architect feels the teleport isnt 
enough 
in a magazine article in april he proposed a huge manmade 
island filling most of tokyo bay it would have singlefamily homes 
for 5 million people at the yen equivalent of 270000 each 
the alternative is the slow but irresistible metamorphosis 
of tokyo into a concrete jungle lacking in human resonance he 
wrote 
japans government offices could move to the 74000acre 527 
billion island to get them out of central tokyo 
tokyo should expand inwards not outwards says noboru 
hozumi a waseda university architecture professor people are 
psychologically drawn toward the center but financially forced 
further away 
high land prices mean most cant afford housing in or near tokyo 
and commute long distances on packed trains 
mitsubishi estate has a dramatic proposal to turn the marunouchi 
business district around the tokyo railroad station where today 
only one building stands higher than 10 stories into a concrete 
canyon of some 60 skyscrapers 40 to 50 stories high 
the 45 billion scheme would create more than 25 times the 
current floorspace allowing 200000 more people to work in the 
area and keep the original red brick tokyo station building a 
popular landmark 
the idea is not embraced by the tokyo government 
commuter trains are already packed roads are jammed theres 
the problem of water supply says planner ogata this plan will 
make things worse 
but mitsubishi claims to have thought everything through 
including treating water so it can be used two or three times 
before running it off 
were proposing underpasses and such to deal with traffic and 
there are four new train lines scheduled to come into marunouchi 
spokesman homma said the plan is completely feasible and hardly 
a dream or we wouldnt have spent three years on it

color conversion of vintage blackandwhite 
films and television shows proceeds around the clock but 
filmmakers are still seeing red over what they call mutilation of 
works of art and insist the fight isnt over 
cable tv mogul ted turner enraged directors last year when he 
began releasing colorenhanced films from his huge mgm library 
ranging from the maltese falcon to casablanca 
i own it ill do whatever i want turner said 
directors say the process perverts their original vision 
likening it to taking crayons to an ansel adams photograph the 
perceived desecration has also united them said charles warn 
spokesman for the directors guild of america 
what ted turner has done singlehandedly through his arrogant 
attempt to disfigure our film heritage is create the largest artist 
rights movement in history warn said 
turner has galvanized these feelings of artists and film 
lovers everywhere he has been a great favor to us despite his 
great arrogance and greed 
with impassioned testimony from actor jimmy stewart the guild 
has managed to push through federal legislation creating a 
governmentappointed national film commission with powers over the 
colorenhancement process 
the us senate is expected to approve the measure in september 
and president reagan is expected to sign it into law by the end of 
the month warn said 
but the law establishing a national film registry for movies 
deemed culturally or historically significant has been 
substantially watereddown executives at turners color lab say it 
will have no impact on them 
it means absolutely nothing all it means is that the 
government has wedged itself into the arts and thats 
ridiculous said charles m powell executive vice president of 
color systems technology inc in the los angeles suburb of marina 
del rey 
the original proposal specified that anyone who colorenhanced a 
picture in the registry would be prohibited from showing the film 
under its original title but that provision was deleted 
for those films said powell we must put a crawl notice 
at the beginning that the film was altered without original 
filmmaker consent 
color systems president buddy young said his firm wouldnt 
suffer under the law because the number of truly classic 
blackandwhite films is small and the number of film candidates 
for colorenhancement is virtually unlimited 
our view of it is that congress passing this legislation is an 
important statement that preservation of our heritage is 
important warn said we view it as an important first step 
this is not the end of the war it is simply a battle that we 
have won the directors guild feels strongly that audiences have a 
right to see the films as originally made and moreover the 
artists have a moral right to have them seen in their original 
form 
for audiences however there will be an abundance of colorized 
movies television shows and cartoons available on video cassette 
and on tv especially turners new turner broadcasting network 
tbn debuting this fall 
color systems is working on 90 colorconverted vintage films 
the cartoon series felix the cat and the tv series abbott and 
costello also the industrys other big color enhancer 
torontobased colorization inc just announced plans to color 138 
episodes of mchales navy 
by the end of october color systems will finish tinting and 
deliver to columbia pictures television the movies the corsican 
brothers starring douglas fairbanks jr miss annie rooney 
starring shirley temple and the western kit carson 
other blackandwhite color systems titles being colorenhanced 
for columbia distribution within eight months include the count 
of monte cristo the man in the iron mask the last of the 
mohicans black beauty the young in heart and black 
magic 
color systems first unveiled the process in 1985 with the 
release of the color version of christmas classic miracle on 34th 
street moviemakers frank capra and john huston led the hue and 
cry over the treatment 
ironically each time the classic humphrey bogart film the 
african queen is aired on television color systems technology is 
flooded with telephone calls complaining about the poor color 
quality 
and that movie was originally shot in color said powell

at a time when better management is seen as the 
key to restoring american business competitiveness some key 
professors of management are earning close to a million dollars a 
year as consultants 
but oddly most of their counterparts in management research 
are never sought out by business not only is business uninterested 
in them and their ideas but oddly they may be equally indifferent 
to business 
the mutual disrespect stands in bold contrast to what is 
happening in other areas of business education in accounting 
finance and sales and marketing where college professors are 
having a field day as consultants 
why not management professors 
the explanation says one professorconsultant lies in an odd 
twist taken by management instruction back in the early 1970s that 
took them away from the practical world of business into that of 
sociology and psychology 
prof eugene jennings of michigan state university a man who 
for years has advised corporate chairmen and chief exectives and 
who has at times actually taken the helm as chairman traces the 
phenomenon to the early 1970s 
at that time he says consulting firms were so eager for 
knowledgeable management people that they grabbed not just the 
graduating classes but their professors too they drained the well 
deans of schools of management became so hard up says jennings 
they hired away sociologists and psychologists from other colleges 
in the universities they were able to succeed because they offered 
higher salaries 
but says jennings these people were more interested in using 
business to advance their understanding of psychology and sociology 
than in using their disciplines to understand and inform business 
in fact says jennings author of many books on management they 
turned away from any commitment to business and developed instead 
their own ethic that says anything to do with business 
especially research is tainted 
they were more interested in organizational behavior than in 
business behavior they preferred to analyze management style 
because they were unable to critique management substance they 
measured success by the correctness of methodology rather than the 
relevancy of findings 
they were not the first to become professional elites and 
withdraw from the real world of practice says jennings it 
happened in medicine law and education at one time or another 
in each instance he says they left voids that needed to be 
filled and they were by osteopaths in medicine by certified 
public accountants in the field of law by concerned practical 
teachers in education 
the results of management professors turning their back on 
business says jennings are 
1 tremendous incomes and unusual stature for the relatively few 
management professors with national standing as good researchers 
and consultants moreover these professors advise at the highest 
levels in the corporation 
2 a loss of constituency at business schools 
business schools seek funding from constituencies of graduates 
and admirers in business but he says these ob organizational 
behavior people arent capable of maintaining or building a 
constituency 
as for the ob folks jennings contends they have evolved into 
neither fish nor fowl that they have an identity problem that 
they are frustrated by the difficulty of proving themselves and 
that they tend to be negative critics 
obviously no admirer the professor contends they have created a 
straw ideal of what constitutes good management and use the ideal 
to judge who is and who isnt acting correctly 
for jennings there is some satisfaction in his analysis he 
recalls the time when he was honored at a famous institution for 
his authorship of the mobile manager a seminal work in 
describing the corporation 
the faculty of the great institution rose in applause he said 
and then he relates he saw a cluster of professors sitting on 
their fat ideals their hands in their laps they were obs of 
course

sixtyfive years after a killer earthquake and 
ensuing firestorms ravaged a crowded tokyo officials are alerting 
people of the possibility of another massive one 
they say it could come anytime between now and the next 20 years 
and is expected to pack enough power to split the ground 
the authorities are using the sept 1 anniversary of the 1923 
great kanto earthquake to organize information fairs and earthquake 
drills and keep up vigilance among residents accustomed to 
frequent mostly harmless earthly shudders 
were constantly doing pr public relations said takeshi 
yanagida of the tokyo city governments disaster countermeasure 
bureau most people know enough to turn off the gas and keep 
emergency supplies of food water money underwear 
in the event of a second great kanto earthquake what 
authorities can do is limited we need help from the people 
much of japan lies along a major fault at the juncture of 
mammoth tectonic plates shifting slowly across the earths surface 
small earthquakes shake the country every day most of them 
unnoticed by humans but to scientists maintaining a 24hour watch 
they are signs of building pressure that must eventually culminate 
in a powerful release 
the resulting quake they say will likely register an 8 on the 
openended richter scale the mexico city quake of 1985 measured 
81 and will strike under or near the kanto plain surrounding the 
capital or along the crowded 170mile tokai belt linking tokyo and 
the western city of nagoya 
in the worstcase scenario the quake will come on a winter 
evening when people are cooking their dinners a day with a dry 
northeasterly wind of about 22 kilometers per hour 14 mph 
yanagida said 
powerful enough to buckle walls and knock people off their feet 
it could set off fires from gas ranges and heaters that would burn 
half a million homes destroy onethird of tokyos living and 
office space kill 37000 people and injure 78000 more scientists 
say a quake along the tokai belt could kill up to 100000 
the tolls while disastrous would still be only a fraction of 
the human cost of the 1923 disaster 
two minutes before noon on sept 1 1923 the earth rose in a 
violent upheaval experts say that if the richter scale had been 
developed at the time it would have registered 78 the earthquake 
toppled houses and scattered embers from cooking fires sparking 
deadly firestorms that swept the capital regions rickety densely 
packed neighborhoods when the embers had cooled as many as 
140000 people had perished mostly in the fires and billions of 
dollars worth of property lay in ruins or badly damaged 
masatoshi rachi then a 13yearold farmers son in eastern 
tokyo recalled watching the firestorms approach after his familys 
house had withstood the tremor 
all around sparks were falling like rain people were 
climbing onto their roofs and wetting them down he said 
those who had lost their homes were setting up barracks 
finding space with relatives our house which fortunately didnt 
burn was so full there was only room enough for people to sit 70 
or 80 in all relatives and strangers 
rachi is now 78 tougher building standards fire and changes of 
business have forced him to rebuild his home five times each time 
though he has taken care to reinforce beams and to prepare a 
parcel with stores of water food a flashlight medicine 
rachi was not alone in learning lessons from the 1923 disaster 
the government restricted use of building bricks stiffened 
regulations on securing window glass and encouraged pioneering 
architecture and engineering that allow skyscrapers to roll and 
sway instead of buckling during tremors 
it sent teams to study the devastation after the 1971 los 
angeles quake when highways collapsed and the one that shook 
mexicos capital three years ago bringing on massive confusion 
among families searching for their missing 
tokyo now has sturdier supports for its elevated highways and is 
experimenting with a wireless system for emergency communications 
recent experience has taught the japanese they are likely to be 
safer indoors during a quake 
but despite the funds the government has poured into earthquake 
prediction the truth is were not 100 percent sure we can 
predict the big one said hirofumi yokoyama of the meteorological 
agencys earthquake prediction division we can be maybe 80 
percent certain 
the system is such that we should be able to predict a large 
kanto quake two or three days in advance he said we cant 
tell exactly when but we can say about where 
with luck the information will be enough to prevent a 
fullscale repetition of the catastrophe 65 years ago under an 
advanced disastercontrol program trains will stop when a 
tremendous quake occurs public address systems will be triggered 
automatically people will congregate with their emergency kits at 
governmentdesignated sites and roadways will be cleared for 
emergency vehicles 
but the unknown element looms 
im terrified of quakes said the tokyo governments 
yanagida theyre not like typhoons which you can at least see 
earthquakes can intensify after they start 
the thing is you just never know

the opposition conservative party is 
seeking to attract apathetic voters for upcoming local elections in 
mexico to rebuild its reputation following a thirdplace finish in 
mexicos presidential balloting in july 
although the national action party or pan traditionally 
mexicos leading opposition maintains its presidential showing 
resulted largely through vote fraud its leaders here and in other 
regions are looking for new supporters for local elections in 
november and next year 
the pan has a good product to sell to citizens but i think 
whats been missing is the knowledge of how to sell it said raul 
monter pan committee president in monterrey the nuevo leon state 
capital and northern mexicos largest city with 28 million people 
municipal elections are scheduled for nuevo leon state nov 9 
and these are seen as a crucial test for the pan 
its a problem of better organization better preparation 
said guillermo prieto pans president in northern chihuahua state 
where mayoral elections are set for next year 
the governments institutional revolutionary party or pri won 
the july 6 presidential election with just barely more than 50 
percent of the vote but it was an upstart centerleft coalition 
led by pridefector cuauhtemoc cardenas that loosened the pris 
tight grip on power in mexico for 59 years 
the cardenas front took 31 percent of the presidential vote and 
won four senate seats a firstever feat for an opposition ticket 
against the pri 
at the same time the pan refuses to accept the presidential 
results on grounds of alleged pri vote rigging 
while pan joins the cardenas opposition in formal protests 
against the pri it still contends that the centerleft coalition 
did so well in july because it is part of the prigovernment 
system 
the government had to create an opposition to receive votes 
from those who are discontent with the system to let them have 
triumphs they never would have given the pan said pablo emilio 
madero pan president for nuevo leon 
the pan which is nearly 50 years old professes to be the only 
party that can cleanse mexico of government corruption which it 
says is the root of the current economic crisis and inadequate 
infrastructure necessary for development 
with that platform the pan has won dozens of mayoral victories 
especially in the northern states 
at one time the pan held mayoralties representing 75 percent of 
the chihuahua state population 
but it never has won a governorship in any of mexicos 31 
states and in most recent mayoral elections the pri has 
steamrolled back to power 
the result is that supporters who might ordinarily vote for pan 
often stay home on election day in the belief they had little hope 
of victory against the pri 
the government achieves two goals when it commits voter 
fraud claimed madero it wins elections and it discourages 
citizen participation 
yet as candidate selection progresses for nuevo leons mayoral 
elections party leaders are acknowledging their failure to develop 
a strong grassroots organization 
we need to go to the people go to small meetings so the 
people can express their doubts madero said in an interview 
we need to convince more people to work for the party 
teresa garcia de madero a nuevo leon state legislator who is 
seeking the nomination as pan mayoral candidate for monterrey said 
the party needs candidates who dont campaign from behind a 
desk 
yet the pans ability to get candidates at all is an achievement 
in itself 
the pan refuses to accept government funds available to all 
opposition parties opting to raise money through donations or 
raffles most candidates finance their own campaigns eliminating 
those who come from modest backgrounds 
entering the pan is not good business said ms garcia 
pri candidates meanwhile have the unlimited backing of the 
government treasury and government employees are recruited to work 
for the party

editors note a valley in peru that is the worlds largest 
single source of coca leaf is the focus of the latest strategy in 
the united states faltering war against the cocaine trade 
american authorities want to eradicate the coca plants with a 
powerful herbicide but that plan is meeting a lot of resistance 
for economic as well as environmental reasons 
</TEXT>

smoke from burning jungle obscures the 
sky above perus upper huallaga valley cradle of the worlds 
cocaine trade and site of a muchdebated us experiment to stamp 
it out with a powerful herbicide 
from a police helicopter flying over the valley thousands of 
bright green fields of coca the raw material of cocaine are 
visible through the haze the plots the labor of tens of thousands 
of peasants who have burned off the hillsides stand out clearly 
against the dark mat of surrounding tropical foliage 
also visible from the air are dozens of illegal landing strips 
cut into the jungle to accommodate the small planes that daily pick 
up shipments of semirefined cocaine for final processing in 
neighboring colombia 
the upper huallaga valley stretches 150 miles north of this 
ramshackle town located on the jungledraped eastern slopes of the 
andes mountains 230 miles northeast of lima 
the valley is the worlds largest single source of coca leaf as 
such it is the focus of the latest strategy in the united states 
faltering war against the cocaine trade 
the us government is testing tebuthiuron an herbicide known 
commercially as spike against coca bushes in a oneacre plot on a 
steep valley slope preliminary results show the chemical to be 
deadly against the tough coca plant aerial application is to be 
tried next 
if that proves effective and if the us government can resolve 
a dispute with the herbicides producer eli lilly and co of 
indianapolis about the safety of the chemical the first program 
of largescale eradication of coca plants could follow 
ten years ago i wouldnt have said this but interdiction 
alone will not stop the flow of cocaine into the united states 
says craig chretien head of the us drug enforcement 
administrations operation in peru 
american officials have sought to reassure peruvians of the 
safety of spike citing studies that indicate the herbicide is less 
toxic to humans than aspirin 
but both peruvian and foreign environmental advocates are 
warning that the use of a strong herbicide in the fragile jungle 
ecosystem is a dangerous gamble 
they fear its longterm consequences and some predict the 
destruction of all plant life in a region of great agricultural 
potential already ravaged by the cocaine industry 
critics also contend that the spike project is politically 
motivated that the reagan administration is seeking 
spectacular results in the drive against cocaine during an 
election year with little regard for the ecological implications 
the questions raised by persons concerned about the impact on 
the environment are perfectly legitimate thats what were trying 
to determine with testing locally us ambassador alexander 
watson said in a recent meeting with american correspondents 
in neighboring bolivia which with peru accounts for more than 
90 percent of the worlds coca leaf production foreign minister 
guillermo bedregal has said his country will not be a guinea 
pig for experimentation with toxic herbicides 
but the centerleft government of president alan garcia in dire 
need of us economic aid has indicated its willingness to attempt 
herbicide eradication in peru if it is convinced the herbicide is 
not harmful to other plants animals and human beings 
the peruvian government is willing to use herbicides and is 
going to use them they are the only weapon we have left against 
drug traffickers says a senior official in perus antidrug 
effort speaking on condition he not be identified by name 
cultivation of coca in peru has soared dramatically from 40000 
acres in 1974 to between 250000 and 400000 acres today 
the increase has come despite a 5yearold americanfinanced 
manual eradication program us officials say manual eradication 
of plants is too slow and too dangerous because workers are exposed 
to attacks by the hired gunmen of the drug barons and by maoist 
shining path rebels who prowl the valley 
thirtyfour members of eradication teams have been killed in 
recent years and in 1987 the 460 workers in the program pulled up 
only 876 acres of plants 
the 3yearold garcia administration has tried to disrupt the 
marketing network of peruvian and colombian drug organizations but 
american drug officials while praising perus commitment say the 
efforts have been frustrated by the far greater resources of the 
cocaine lords 
since 1985 a special antinarcotics police force has 
confiscated nearly 100 tons of semirefined cocaine paste burned 
770 crude jungle labs for producing paste and dynamited more than 
170 clandestine airstrips according to gen juan zarate head of 
the narcotics unit 
but the drug gangs have quickly repaired the dirt runways often 
within 24 hours using wellpaid work crews of local villagers and 
sometimes even earthmoving tractors zarate said in an interview 
the campaign against cocaine ran into a new obstacle since the 
fanatical shining path guerrillas extended their presence in the 
upper huallaga valley in early 1987

the guerrillas now control large areas of the valley they have 
exploited resentment of the manual eradication program to win 
support among peasants growing coca 
even more dangerous from the governments viewpoint is the 
informal alliance that has developed between the rebels and the 
local drug lords us officials police and peasants say the 
rebels are building up a multimilliondollar war chest with 
earnings from the drug trade 
counterinsurgency officials believe the explosive combination of 
subversion and cocaine trafficking may have played a role in 
garcias decision to allow the united states to begin testing 
herbicides in the upper huallaga last october 
tests were begun with 30 herbicides eventually us 
researchers concluded that spike was the most effective and safest 
now they want to try aerial application of spike in pellet form 
to see how accurately planes can drop them on coca fields most of 
them smaller than an acre and interspersed with jungle spraying 
has been ruled out because the liquid might be blown to surrounding 
areas 
us officials say the aerial testing is on hold until the 
us government can resolve its dispute with lilly the company 
announced in late may that because of a number of practical and 
policy considerations it would not sell spike for use in peru 
against coca 
state department officials say that lilly is worried about 
reprisals from international drug traffickers and that the company 
also fears lawsuits for any ecological damage 
the company stands by spikes safety if used as directed against 
brush in grasslands in the us west the purpose for which it was 
designed but not as an herbicide against coca in perus jungle 
a pamphlet distributed with the herbicide warns that it will 
kill trees and shrubs if their roots come in contact with it 
the problem is that spike is not designed specifically for 
coca says edgar machado an agronomy professor at the national 
agrarian university in lima and perus leading expert on coca 
any broadleaf plant that comes in contact with spike is going 
to die and broadleaf plants make up 98 percent of the jungle the 
exposed soil will be washed away by the valleys torrential rains 
the erosion will be terrible machado says 
but us embassy officials argue that the upper huallaga is 
already being destroyed by the cocaine industry and the only way to 
save it for future agricultural use is to wipe out coca 
cultivation thats not a pristine jungle out there watson 
says 
studies by peruvian experts say that more than 17 million acres 
of tropical forest have been destroyed by peasants clearing land 
since the coca boom began in the 1970s 
a flight over the valley seems to bear this out from the air 
parts of the region look as though they have been bombed hill 
after hill is peeled of vegetation millions of fallen tree trunks 
present a picture of devastation 
at least 150 rivers in the upper huallaga valley have suffered 
perhaps irreparable damage from chemicals used to process cocaine 
paste in jungle labs many species of fish already have 
disappeared according to a study by buenaventura marcelo a 
professor at the national agrarian university 
since 1970 cocaine paste producers have dumped millions of 
gallons of sulfuric acid acetone and other toxic chemicals into 
streams that flow into the amazon marcelo says creating a grave 
threat to the survival of the regions rich aquatic resources 
although the debate on the use of a potent herbicide has 
centered on ecological damage perus government must also consider 
the economic and social consequences of destroying illegal coca 
cultivation 
us drug experts estimate that cocaine trafficking generates at 
least 700 million annually for peru a sum equal to nearly 30 
percent of the countrys legal export earnings 
with peru mired in its worst economic troubles of the century 
many peruvians wonder whether the country can afford to wipe out 
coca cultivation 
if this bankrupt nation has dollars circulating on the 
streets it is because of drug trafficking machado says it is 
not in anyones interest to kill the goose that lays the golden 
eggs 
some 200000 peasants have migrated to the upper huallaga valley 
in the past two decades to grow coca because they can earn 10 times 
as much from it as from other crops 
some government officials believe that if coca is eradicated in 
the upper huallaga without a program to help the peasants they 
will migrate elsewhere cut down more trees and plant more coca 
that would also create resentment that the shining path would be 
quick to exploit 
in san pedro a cluster of a dozen shacks alongside a dirt 
airstrip lost in the jungle 60 miles north of tingo maria guzman 
tamamuro already is bitter toward the government 
as he watched police troopers burn a small pile of his drying 
coca leaves tamamuro said 
im just a poor man trying to feed my family they think all 
of us are big cocaleros but they are wrong why dont they just 
burn us up with the coca and be done with it

editors note contrary to many new yorkers notions the 
super was not invented in their town but like everything else in 
the big apple hes a member of a widly varying species he can be 
a tyrant who turns predator around christmas time he can also be 
crisply professional and superefficient 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
hes the super sometimes more like a mayor 
of a small town an observant shrink a cat rescuer mouse 
undertaker burglar chaser hes an arbiter detective middleman 
and ultimately the guy whose fault it is when anything goes wrong 
the buck stops there sometimes literally 
the species is most annoyed to be called a janitor 
its natural habitat is new york city where complaining about 
ones super is just about second to complaints about the weather 
but migrations have been noted as highrises proliferate across the 
country their reputations vary as widely as stockbrokers and sink 
as low as usedcar salesmens huckstering a misaligned bionic 
wonder 
theres the drunken lout scenario true enough in some cases 
theres the crowd who speak yugoslav greek moroccan and perchance 
esperanto but no english please theres the guy whose hand 
assumes the palmup position before lips purse into the hello 
position 
there are those who while required to live in the building by 
law moonlight elsewhere during working hours sightings of such 
supers are as rare as those of flamingos on the bering strait 
but there are supers who are ordinary folks guys just doing a 
rather complex job joe thomas is one such super a family man with 
three daughters a new yorker whose first job was pedaling 400 
pounds of potatoes across the isle of manhattan from a west side 
italian vegetable stand to a fancy east side restaurant 
hes a man who believes strongly in doing things the 
oldfashioned way 
he also really goes beyond the call of duty to help the citizens 
of his domain 
in some ways hes a boy wonder now 31 hes already overseeing 
his second building the current one a 22story highrise near 
lincoln center which houses about 1000 persons in 375 apartments 
he has been there five years kows all residents at least by 
sight and admits there are a few who wont speak to him he just 
continues to say hello to them about 60 percent of the apartments 
are cooperatives the remainder rentals 
he supervises a staff of 10 doormen porters and handymen in 
1987 he was named super of the year by the large real estate 
firm that employs about 150 supers for its buildings he received a 
savings bond and a plaque being the kind of the man he is he went 
out and bought a second plaque 
it said staff of the year 
the staff liked that 
not that things are always smooth 
sometimes i think im running a kindergarten says joe 
everybody is mad at everybody 
thomas grew up in hells kitchen where his father who always 
worked two jobs to make ends meet split when joe was 10 joe 
married at 18 a girl named ellen he met when he was 11 
his wifes father was and still is a super and joe got his 
training from him 
he broke me in with no mercy he had me painting in 35degree 
weather when the paint was like molasses he had me clearing drain 
lines when i didnt know all the sewage would come down on me after 
i broke through but i learned how to do a lot of things 
he got his first building at 21 very young and he chased quite 
a few burglars from the back of the terraces much to his wifes 
distress 
id get a report and go charging into the apartment luckily 
always too late one night when the cops were called i saw them 
go after a prowler with their guns drawn and i thought what am i 
doing charging in unarmed 
he doesnt do that any more 
his most awful moment he says was when he was asked to go into 
an apartment of a man who hadnt shown up for work that day 
i just had a terrible feeling in the pit of my stomach when i 
turned the key in the lock i cant tell you why i just knew it 
was going to be bad sure enough the place had been ransacked but 
there was no sign of the missing gentlemen as we were about to 
leave we saw a pile of blankets

<TEXT>
i pulled them back and there he was beaten to death 
he has found three bodies in all the others old folks who lived 
and died alone 
occupational hazards vary 
joe went to a womans apartment to fix the airconditioner she 
doublelocked the door and asked him to remove his shoes which are 
in fact boots troublesome to unlace he said no the 
airconditioner was working fine 
oh thank you she said let me give you something no 
need said joe 
whereupon she grabbed him at the door and planted a big kiss on 
his neck he raced straight to his own apartment lunch at home is 
one of the perks of the job 
he avoids family problems and anything else thats not against 
the law he has never inquired for instance why one resident is 
sometimes spotted sitting in the lobby waiting to be picked up as 
he moves tarantulas in and out of the building 
its not against the law and nobody complains says joe 
im essentially a middleman and im in the middle of 
everything already i believe in live and let live 
joe is discreet about the foibles of his overextended family 
but sitting in his office one gets clues 
hes negotating a roachproblem settlement on the telephone with 
management 
but you know her he says shell have us in court in two 
days if something isnt covered right 
his biggest gripe is when he or his staff go way above the call 
of duty and the resident acts as though they were private servants 
i once froze my ears off getting a taxi for someone and she 
gave the driver a 5 bill for stopping she gave me a quarter i 
would have preferred that she had just said thank you 
his other gripe is when he tries to take his family out for 
dinner and 10 people stop him before he can get five feet away from 
the building there is a book at the front desk for complaints 
joe theoretically works from 8 am to 430 pm this is not to 
say that joe is a recluse after 430 he has rescued a snarling and 
angry pet cat which tumbled into the building courtyard he has 
played the part of a cat burglar at 3 am when someone locked 
himself out 
they lived on the 17th floor and i know the people on the 16th 
floor werent home so i took a ladder up to their terrace climbed 
i and jumped the last two feet and caught onto the window i 
climbed in and then let the people in 
lesser supers would have said call the locksmith 
a very elderly woman needed help when there was a foulup in the 
schedule of her roundtheclock nurses joe picked her up when she 
fell his wife undressed her and put her to bed and joes sister 
came over to spend the night with her 
the biggest pain in the job is getting contractors to work the 
oldfashioned way he says to be here when they say theyre 
going to be here 
a lot of thomas work is overseeing the contracts that go 
anywhere from 100000 to 600000 worth of work in a given year 
he has had his share of kickback offers 
i dont do business that way he says supers that take 
kickbacks have homes in the hamptons 
he likes to keep his family as private as possible and most 
residents he says dont even know his wife on sight 
theyre not on the payroll 
his eldest daughter 12yearold michelle picks up some pocket 
change by babysitting cats dogs and kids 
thats a normal thing for a girl of that age to do so its 
all right by me says joe 
the family also includes daughters karen 10 and kelly 9 as 
well as rags an adorable mutt 
joe loves to fish and boasts hes one of the few fathers around 
with three daughters who bait hooks themselves he has taken the 
kids to disney world and fishing on the ocean and in streams and 
ponds upstate and in connecticut

become a movie producer again this time backing nonmainstream 
productions by other writers 
im talking with some people about starting a production 
company where people can submit material that they think would not 
be considered by the established studios young writers who might 
have ideas for tv shows and film he said in a recent interview 
were going to option books comedy dramas it doesnt matter 
anything creative 
dylan was producerdirectorwriteractoreditor on the 1978 
renaldo and clara which marked the film debut of his friend 
and sometime collaborator sam shepard the overlong surrealistic 
account of the rolling thunder revue tour also starred joan baez 
arlo guthrie allen ginsberg harry dean stanton joni mitchell 
dylans exwife sara and just about everyone else on the tour 
but dylan got good notices with an offbeat bit part in the 1973 sam 
peckinpah film pat garrett and billy the kid he wrote 
knockin on heavens door for the movie 
i had to make that movie with almost a gun pointed at my 
head he said with a laugh originally i was just going to 
write the music and the song and then we got down to mexico and it 
was impossible to get out and sam peckinpah who directed that 
movie was a real tyrant a lovable tyrant and he says youre 
gonna be in this movie and i didnt have much choice 
dylan recently did another acting turn playing a reclusive rock 
star in the feature film hearts of fire but the movie has 
never been released the director richard marquand jagged 
edge died not long after its completion 
he wanted me to be in that movie i couldnt understand why 
said dylan but he convinced me that id be good in it and he 
wanted me and only me i had time at that time and i did it and i 
enjoyed working with some people in there costar rupert everett 
was fantastic we got to just like improvise things i wasnt 
really all that comfortable with standing in front of the camera 
and having to give reactions that made me feel kinda stupid but i 
enjoyed working with rupert 
dylan said he never saw the completed film 
in fact he doesnt see very many movies but he did like 
peewee hermans big top peewee this unexpected revelation 
draws an expectable response see you actually laugh i went 
with a friend who said it was a joke he said i thought it was 
good though it had such a strange perception of reality first of 
all the guys got a talkin pig once you get beyond that that 
the pig talks its a natural thing you know 
the circus ringmaster had a wife that could stand in his hand 
i thought that was really incredible i thought it was really 
allegorical you know and the color was brightly unreal you cant 
compare it to war and peace

the french revolutions bicentennial is coming up 
next year with fireworks political and historical squabbles 
commemorative underwear and miniature guillotines all part of the 
show 
the festivities are designed to peak july 14 on the 200th 
anniversary of the storming of the bastille prison in 1789 the 
most memorable event of the long and turbulent revolutionary years 
even in a normal year bastille day celebrations of military 
regalia on the champselysees dancing in local fire halls and 
fireworks in the skies mark july 14 in paris and provincial towns 
similar to the american 4th of july 
but organizers are working frantically to make 1989s events 
unforgettable 
they admit to being far behind schedule partly because both the 
first man chosen to head the bicentennial mission businessman 
michel baroin and his successor centrist politician edgar faure 
died shortly after taking office leaving the agency leaderless 
until this past may 
jeannoel jeanneney the new president of the bicentennial 
operation told reporters recently after meeting with president 
francois mitterrand that he hoped to have his plans spelled out by 
the end of september 
when you have less time to do things you do them in less 
time jeanneney said many great events that went down in 
history were prepared in extreme haste 
the planning was also hung up in political feuding during the 
past two years when the conservative government of jacques chirac 
was jousting with mitterrand a socialist 
after mitterrands reelection in may and the installation of 
socialist michel rocard as premier the missions budget was nearly 
tripled to the franc equivalent of about 20 million 
chirac who remains involved in the bicentennial as mayor of 
paris recently said he had the feeling the socialists want to 
profit from this commemoration by emphasizing certain historical 
aspects in the presentation to the detriment of the consensus that 
michel baroin and edgar faure were promoting 
the french revolution has been a focus for political divisions 
ever since it began and the approach of the bicentennial renewed 
the debate over what exactly was being celebrated 
there are many variations of the revolution but in broad terms 
french rightists are likely to say they approve of the abolition of 
the nobilitys privileges in 1789 and the establishment of the 
republic in 1792 but are appalled by the mass executions of the 
terror in 179394 
some french leftists argue that people should take the 
revolution as an undivided whole and be for it or against it 
they suggest that rightists picking and choosing among elements of 
the revolution are closet counterrevolutionaries 
its surprising that two centuries later the founding act of 
the republic remains a propaganda tool and a source of partisan 
quarrels and polemics but its also a consequence of the 
revolutionary heritage itself the independent newspaper le monde 
wrote in a frontpage article summing up the squabbles 
a poll published in the conservative weekly le figaro magazine 
found that when asked to name which events best symbolize the 
revolution 74 percent of french people said the declaration of the 
rights of man on oct 2 1789 with only 55 percent choosing the 
bloody july 14 assault on the bastille prison 
although the bastille was a hated symbol of repression and once 
housed political prisoners the revolutionary crowd that 
overwhelmed its defenders found only seven inmates to be freed 
four men convicted of fraud two lunatics and a nobleman the 
count de salages who was imprisoned for incest 
le figaros poll also found 61 percent saying king louis xvi 
should not have been beheaded at the guillotine while 14 percent 
maintained it was the right thing to do and 25 percent had no 
opinion 
the us bicentennial did not turn up many americans who thought 
the american revolution was a bad thing but in france some people 
are still against the whole idea of their own uprising 
we think it was a revolt against god and not just a revolt 
against power said jeanbaptiste chaumeil a member of a group 
hoping to make a counterrevolutionary demonstration aug 15 1989 
at place de la concorde where the guillotine stood one of the 
biggest events of the bicentennial year 
chaumeil said the group called association 15 aout 1989 august 
15 association includes both royalists who want france to have a 
king again and republicans who oppose any return to the monarchy 
but find a celebration of the revolutions antichurch policies 
distasteful 
for the past year a monthly newsletter called lanti89 has 
been recalling the dark side of the revolution especially its 
harsh suppression of roman catholic clergy 
the group is distributing a poster showing a revolutionary 
carrying a guillotined head on a spike and asks are we really 
going to celebrate that 
in fact miniature guillotines for sale as souvenirs are among 
the many commercial spinoffs of the bicentennial 
textile manufacturer cet has obtained permission to use the 
official bicentennial logo showing three bluewhiteandred doves 
in flight on a line of clothing and cet director christian 
mariolle said he expects the tshirt and the underpants to be the

regina rocha has one of the best 
views in the world from her home she can look out at famed sugar 
loaf mountain at the entrance to rio de janeiros guanabara bay 
the towering christ of corcovado with outstretched arms overlooking 
the city and the luxury apartments far below on the atlantic ocean 
its a picturepostcard every day 
but a view is about all regina rocha has she is poor and her 
home is a soursmelling oneroom wooden shack beside a sewage 
ditch 
she lives in one of the hundreds of slums known as favelas on 
the hillsides and outskirts of the city 
mrs rocha 38 and her four children are typical of millions of 
brazilians in the slums trapped between the poverty and despair of 
brazils underdevelopment and the prosperity of a small influential 
elite 
but unrest is growing in the favelas like hers and authorities 
and academics say it poses a threat to brazils threeyearold 
civilian government 
crime and violence often drugrelated are on the rise and 
some officials say a type of civil war already exists between 
the traditionally complacent slum dwellers and the shrinking middle 
and upper classes 
in rio protesting residents of the huge rocinha hillside favela 
twice this year blocked the main road connecting downtown to 
wealthy residential beach districts and battled police 
this is the beginning of informal civil war between slum 
dwellers and brazils elite mayor roberto saturnio braga of rio 
de janeiro said in an interview poverty and social injustice are 
at the root of the new violence 
sen afonso arinos de melo franco a former cabinet minister and 
widely respected as brazils elder statesman recently told the 
congress in brasilia we are seeing a new and special type of 
urban warfare it is based on neither ideology nor religion but on 
empty violence 
on paper brazil has the western worlds eighthlargest economy 
behind italy and above spain but according to the world bank 
income distribution is the most unequal anywhere the 1 percent 
richest brazilians own as much as the poorest 50 percent together 
while 65 percent of the 144 million population lives in misery on 
less than 90 monthly according to government figures 
the roots of inequality in brazil go back 400 years when the 
portuguese crown handed out huge tracts of land to trusted officers 
and created an elite class of landowners 
but the split deepened during the economic miracle of rapid 
growth in the late 1960s and early 1970s the military government 
then in power decided the best way to encourage development was to 
concentrate the wealth in the hands of the upper classes and 
the gap between rich and poor widened 
the gap is perhaps most evident in rio brazils secondlargest 
city with 10 million people 
over the past 30 years rio has lost the federal capital to 
brasilia and banks and industry to sao paulo the nations largest 
city rio today cant generate enough jobs or revenues to attend 
its population and slums have nearly tripled in size since 1960 
today an estimated 2 million people live in 450 illegal 
shantytowns built on the slopes of steep hills that jut up 
throughout the city about 4 million more live in slums on the 
citys outskirts most of them unemployed migrants from the 
droughtprone northeast 
the picture is similar in other brazilian cities in sao paulo 
brazils economic and industrial center at least 75 million of 
the 13 million inhabitants live in precarious conditions 
nationwide 71 percent of brazilians have no running water while 
85 percent are not hooked up to sewage lines according to 
government figures 
mrs rocha a small woman earns the equivalent of 60 monthly 
as a health worker in her slum and supports two teenage boys and 
two grade schoolage children more than threequarters of her 
income goes to buy rice beans eggs and an occasional piece of 
meat she said 
she lives atop the santa marta shantytown a community of 10000 
on a steep hillside slope not far from downtown rio rubbish lines 
the ratinfested paths that weave between fragile scrap wood and 
brick shanties the stench from the sewage and rotting garbage is 
close to unbearable 
in mrs rochas shack two faded color photographs liven the 
chaos of sacks and clothes strewn between the tiny stove bursting 
closet and single bed her only possessions 
but not even her jumbled home is a refuge from the misery and 
violence that surround her

police brandishing submachine guns and other weapons daily scour 
the dank winding alleys and piggyback shanties for petty thieves 
and drugs mrs rochas two oldest sons 14 and 16 years old are 
regularly searched for stolen goods or drugs as they make their way 
up the steep winding hillside steps she said 
i hardly even notice anymore when the police barge into my 
home looking for something she said im even used to the guns 
and shootouts we just close the door and wait for the gun battles 
to end 
a major shootout between bandits and police in september 1987 
lasted a week 
in rocinha a similar hillside shantytown of 250000 
inhabitants walk a mile or more to fetch water it has just two 
doctors two schools accommodating only 1500 of the 10000 
schoolage children one small police post and no federal 
representatives despite its size 
but for many the slum in rios prosperous south zone is a 
luxury and rents have soared beyond the reach of many residents 
who work mostly in the wealthy south zone neighborhoods as maids 
office clerks or manual laborers 
rios slum life however is an improvement for some 
our life is better here than it was in ceara said aguinaldo 
da silva who two years ago brought his wife and three children 
from ceara state in the northeastern drought region to stay with 
relatives in rio at least here we have water i can find odd 
jobs and we can eat every day 
for inhabitants of rios hillside communities the return to 
civilian government has been a hollow triumph 
its ridiculous to talk about democracy here the rev 
thierry de linardt a roman catholic priest said in an interview 
its like talking about camembert to someone who has never tasted 
cheese 
people have no sense of citizenship he added their needs 
are so vast they cant afford to question the government or anyone 
who might help them poverty is used to political advantage 
de linardt said the lack of an effective social welfare system 
has opened doors for drug traffickers in the slums 
in the absence of a government presence drug kingpins have 
taken control of slum communities and often serve as protectors 
under a law of their own twenty elite drug chiefs employ some 
40000 people citywide and have been known to help out needy 
families and keep petty thieves away 
youths often are attracted to them and the police are seen as 
enemies 
kids growing up in slums are looking for recipes for 
immediate relief from a desperate situation de linardt said 
theyre treated with violence and they respond with violence 
were creating a generation who understand only the language of 
violence 
the government is shutting off all other channels for slum 
youths itamar silva spokesman for the santa marta community 
said in an interview 
late last year rocinha dwellers marched down from the hillside 
to protest the imprisonment of slum baron denis leandro da silva 
and in a nightlong battle with police closed off the principal 
tunnel from the city center to prosperous suburbs smashing cars 
trying to get through 
earlier this year slum inhabitants occupied a governmentowned 
plot of land near rocinha and marked out areas to build new homes 
arguing they could no longer pay the high rents when police tried 
to remove them they once again blocked traffic and battled police 
with sticks and stones 
five more years without a clear social program and serious 
public sector investments and collective life in rio will be 
impossible said a leading sociologist helio jaguaribe no 
democracy will be able to withstand the chaos

muscovites call them priyezhayushi the 
arrivals hordes of peasant women who pour into moscow on morning 
trains and special buses with empty satchels they hope to fill 
with groceries for their families in the provinces 
they are said to number more than a million on any given day 
adding to moscows resident population of 9 million and are 
testimony to what is euphemistically referred to as the food 
situation a chain of shortage inequity and waste that keeps 
most soviets on a diet of bread and potatoes 
every man woman and child eats twothirds of a pound of 
potatoes each day and 13 ounces of bread according to government 
figures 
soviets also eat 25 percent more sugar than recommended in the 
1982 food program composed by the communist partys agricultural 
secretary at the time and the nations leader now mikhail s 
gorbachev that is twice as much per person as the average american 
in reality the diet of rural soviets is even more dependent on 
starches than the figures suggest much of the soviet unions meat 
and fresh fruit is sent to special stores that cater to officials 
big trade unions and foreigners leaving little but fatty sausage 
behind for sale outside major cities 
the best supplies of most things are to be found in moscow but 
living in the capital guarantees little for the everyday citizen 
its not correct to say that there is a shortage of meat now 
there is a virtual absence of meat complained vera kudryavtseva 
a 42yearold wife and mother living in moscow sometimes you get 
lucky and run into a line for meat on your way home from work but 
if you go out looking for it you cant find it anywhere 
she and soviet homemakers across this country of 280 million 
people contend that it is even harder now than a decade ago to put 
a decent meal on the table the daily newspaper selskaya zhizn said 
in late august that rural soviets now eat less meat eggs potatoes 
and fruit than they did five years ago 
thats a serious problem for general secretary gorbachev who has 
said that improved living conditions will be a major measure of his 
program to reform the soviet economy 
lagging farm output and a generally inadequate diet is largely 
laid to farm collectivization the drive initiated by josef v 
stalin in 1929 that tore peasants from the land some contend 
irrevocably 
but the recent worsening of food availability can also be 
attributed to new influences that are the byproducts of gorbachevs 
reform soviet consumers have been hoarding some foods in fear of 
major price increases and a switch in management and planning 
approaches to encourage more local autonomy has in some areas 
created confusion and slowed output 
the shortages may also be more apparent now because glasnost 
gorbachevs policy of greater openness about social problems has 
opened discussion of inadequate production on gigantic state farms 
for six decades 
as part of his reform program gorbachev has been trying to 
instill incentive and personal pride in soviet farmers by allowing 
families and cooperative brigades to lease state land for 
smallerscale operations 
calling for broader use of leasing and family farming he 
contended in a speech to the party leadership in late july that 
there is nothing nonsocialist in this 
but media reports have exposed the outright resentment some 
soviets have for those who succeed at it 
the weekly newspaper moscow news reported in july that three 
fires destroyed a prosperous pig farm in the village of saltykovka 
about 20 miles from central moscow and that arson was suspected 
because of the fears of local residents that the farm posed an 
environmental and ideological threat 
but moscow news added the most vigilant of the saltykovka 
residents smelled a different kind of odor the pernicious spirit 
of profitmaking and capitalism 
meat has not been on sale in saltykova shops for some time now 
but this doesnt mean at all that the 700 inhabitants of the 
settlement are vegetarians no they eat meat but meat bought in 
moscow 
inadequate storage and transport and a mass exodus of young 
soviets from rural areas have slowed progress in food production 
and distribution 
a third of the grain crop still is lost between harvest and 
milling according to us government estimates gorbachev himself 
conceded in march that at least a quarter of the harvest is lost or 
ruined each year 
food not lost in harvest or transport also is distributed 
according to overly centralized and often illogical plans 
the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya reported that of the 16000 
tons of meat the city of kaluga is ordered to deliver yearly to 
consumers in moscow 100 miles to the northeast 7000 tons are 
bought back by kaluga residents who spend a whole day traveling to 
and from the capital like the priyezhayushi 
distribution of fresh foods is so haphazard that even store 
managers seldom know when produce will arrive

aloha summer lorimar home video vhsbeta 7995 rated pg 
 
the temptation is very strong to dismiss aloha summer as 
another silly summer surfandskin flick but this film one mans 
recollection of the summer of 1959 spent in hawaii tries and 
sometimes succeeds to be more 
the trouble is that its hard to be both a light beach romp and 
a serious look at the summer when six teenage boys learned how 
to surf and how to be ourselves as the narrator says 
much of director tommy lee wallaces movie is predictable but 
there also is racism and conflicts involving generation gaps and 
independence which young audiences should understand and 
appreciate 
the movie concerns six unlikely pals two white kids from the 
mainland one rich one workingclass a japanese boy and his 
cousin who lives in hawaii and two hawaiians they find it far 
easier than their parents and other adults to cross the social and 
economic lines between them 
some of the conflicts arise when the rich kid falls in love with 
a hawaiian girl angering his parents and her brother the japanese 
boy fails to hold to the standards set by his samurai father and 
the hawaiians see the good and bad of the mainlanders who invade 
the island 
there are few surprises and one can guess how most of the 
conflicts are resolved there also are gorgeous exciting scenes of 
surfing the performances are fine though none is a standout

no filmmaker did crosscountry travel better on screen than 
alfred hitchcock when he brilliantly directed north by 
northwest in 1959 with an ounce of wit and a speck of adventure 
john hughes planes trains and automobiles doesnt even rate a 
close fourth 
as a comedy of errors and misadventures planes fails 
miserably largely because what is presented as humor leaves one 
uncomfortable fuming and puzzled the setups are stupid rather 
than funny the characters pathetic rather than amusing 
steve martin plays neal page an advertising executive on a new 
york business trip he leaves for his home in chicago right before 
the thanksgiving holiday a simple twohour trip by airplane 
right wrong 
his plight begins when he tries to get a taxi in midtown 
manhattan at the height of the evening rush hour the guy has to be 
out of his gourd to even think hed see a cab in his dreams let 
alone on the streets of new york he finally reaches the airport 
only to find that his firstclass seat has been given away and 
hes stuck in coach with an obese crass curtain ring salesman 
named del griffith john candy as his seat mate 
when the plane is rerouted to kansas because of snowed griffith 
suggests they spend the night at a seedy motel and try and leave in 
the morning instead of remaining at the airport 
thus begins the trek and the justification for the movies title 
only a moron would make the decisions page does certainly not a 
welltraveled chicago businessmen its painful to watch 
martin and candy who virtually are alone in this yawn of a 
flick work well enough with a thin script by john hughes whose 
previous works include such vapid adolescent excursions as pretty

gregory hines cbs gregory hines 
 
it pays to know the right people 
gregory hines a popular actor and dancer has released a 
catchy listenable collection of dance songs and ballads but the 
albums success has far more to do with 
songwriterproducerarrangerfriend luther vandross than with 
hines rather bland singing 
vandross helped introduce hines to the pop music world last year 
when they did a duet on theres nothing better than love now 
vandross takes friendship one step further by wrapping hines voice 
around seven new songs 
hines has a high thin voice that lacks the timbre of great soul 
singers such as vandross perhaps vandross knows this hines voice 
is often buried amidst a batallion of backup singers and only on 
this is what i believe does he get a chance to stretch out 
if vandross wants to promote a singers career he might try 
excrystal darlene love who sings backup on gregory hines 
that girl wants to dance with me is a hit single and 
theres nothing better than love is also included

perfect machine columbia herbie hancock 
 
the title of this record says it all a machine could have made 
much of it and in fact often does 
hancock a jazz veteran who pioneered the jazzrock fusion 
style plays no less than 12 different keyboards on perfect 
machine nearly all programmed by computer 
it may be state of the art but it doesnt have much soul 
the six songs on perfect machine are neatly divided into 
three complex instrumentals full of distorted voices and 
insectlike buzzes pops and pings and three funkier pieces with 
vocals by sugarfoot of the ohio players 
of the instrumentals maiden voyagebpop is the best 
featuring some fretpopping bass from william bootsy collins 
and two sweeping eloquent piano solos by hancock perfect 
machine features a slashing keyboard melody in its stopstart 
mechanical rhythm while chemical residue is a meandering piece 
full of whispery computer voices 
collins and sugarfoot step to the forefront on the three vocal 
tracks all of which are eminently danceable beat wise which 
kicks off side 2 has collins at his thunderous best putting some 
real life into the record obsession continues hancocks 
herkyjerky keyboard exercises while vibe alive brings up 
sugarfoots yowling vocals 
as a dance record perfect machine would work just fine 
cranked up to top volume as technology it may be a milestone 
but as jazz rock or funk or any combination thereof its as

heavy nova emi manhattan robert palmer 
 
longsought success is sweet but it can also prove unduly 
seductive 
ask robert palmer after years of cult figure status releasing 
an occasional irresistible song to a mostly indifferent public 
hits such as addicted to love made this british veteran an 
established star 
with the new heavy nova he faces the challenge of keeping 
that star on the rise 
unfortunately palmer takes the easy route everything about the 
single simply irresistible from the chunkachunka power 
station beat to the reprise of beautiful women pouting in the 
video smells like a ripoff even more annoying hes ripping off 
himself 
it leaves a bad taste that heavy nova doesnt have the 
strength to recover from despite some admirable attempts at 
stretching out 
more than ever is a noisy car wreck of a song the attempt 
at crossing cultures in change his ways which mixes yodeling 
a rollicking accordion and a vocal riff lifted from the lion 
sleeps tonight sounds like a confused airline terminal on a hot 
day 
palmers at his best when he relaxes and lets his good taste 
take over she makes my day is a firstrate pop song that 
easily eclipses everything on this record disturbing behavior 
which gives palmer the chance to show off his strong soulful 
voice is another success 
if hed trusted these instincts a little more heavy nova 
would have been better

don johnson is faced with carving out a 
feature film career following his huge success with tvs miami 
vice 
and hes becoming rather philosophical about it all 
if james stewart or henry fonda were in my position today and 
they could pick any film they wanted what would they pick what 
would they do i figured out theyd get out of the business 
there wasnt really anything theyd want to do he said 
like michael j fox bruce willis and other tv stars johnson 
was flooded with offers from film producers seeking to transmit his 
sonny crockett allure to theatrical attractions 
i was offered a lot of what i call affectionately bodycount 
pictures said johnson by page three ive snuffed 12 to 15 
people i just wasnt interested i really believe that people 
arent interested either i like actionadventure pictures but i 
think theres an overabundance of them 
instead he chose sweet hearts dance in which he wields 
nothing more lethal than a fly rod the movie which is being 
released this month by tristar casts him as a smalltown new 
england builder whose marriage to susan sarandon is drifting into 
boredom and atrophy the intensely human script by ernest thompson 
on golden pond deals with relationships among husband and 
wife and friends played by jeff daniels and elizabeth perkins 
don johnson waited until after three seasons of miami vice 
before undertaking a feature he had made the littlenoticed 
cease fire before starting the series 
i wanted to find something that had a sense of humor to it 
that in a breath you would laugh and you would cry that would be 
about people about us about what we do about our feelings he 
said in an interview 
what is the single most important personal crisis facing all 
of us in the 20th century i think i found that in sweet hearts 
dance its a film about us about our feelings about how we have 
figured out how to go to the moon but we cant figure out how to 
talk to each other we dont know how to say what we feel about 
each other 
we dont know how to maintain relationships how to stay out 
of divorce courts myself included he had two youthful annulments 
one divorce im not being selfrighteous about this the most 
important thing we can do for the remainder of this century is to 
figure out how to love each other 
pretty heady stuff from the guy with the roughneck reputation 
or so the scandal tabloids would have us believe johnson has been 
fair game ever since miami vice hit the home screen in a burst 
of pastels in the fall of 1984 coverage accelerated when he and 
barbra streisand became an item johnson has been known to be 
touchy about incursions on his privacy but he seems to have 
mellowed 
its a difficult thing to deal with and i would be lying if i 
said it wasnt he said i try to keep a sense of humor about 
it and just say the alternative is not acceptable in my business 
the don johnson saga has been well pickedover by the tabloids 
as well as the more respectable national press how he was born 
dec 15 1950 to a farmer and beautician in galena mo his 
juvenile delinquency leaving home at 16 falling in love with 
acting in a high school production of west side story 
after winning a scholarship to the university of kansas johnson 
plunged into drama he later studied at the american conservatory 
theater in san francisco and began finding stage and film roles in 
hollywood frustrated by failure and rejection he became a major 
party animal in the 1970s falling into alcohol and drug abuse 
that helped slow his progress 
did he ever think hed never make it as an actor 
many many times he said but i made a decision early on 
that i did this acting because i love it whether or not i became 
rich and famous was not the criteria for doing it there were two 
reasons one im not qualified for anything else and two its 
what i love to do 
an artist doesnt paint to be represented by sothebys if he 
becomes an artist of renown though maybe not in his lifetime his 
paintings will bring great sums of money but he paints because he 
must paint and i felt i must act

incorporated 50 shades of blues purples reds greens violets 
siennas yellows and pinks to portray a universe that glows 
to achieve the stunning dimensions of the mural and eliminate 
the lead unions common to stainedglass he sent for dutch 
technicians who had developed a special process of melting and 
layering glass 
prisms of colored glass up to five inches thick some created in 
ovens as hot as 1652 degrees fahrenheit 900 degrees celsius were 
layered using clear chemical resins then chipped with band saws to 
split the light 
the combined result of the artists design and the refracted 
light is a cosmos in motion 
for nearly eight months tamayo and the crew worked in mexico 
city to piece together the windows 30 panels using silicon resins 
instead of lead 
the result is a monolithic crystal said martinez it 
looks like one piece of glass 
tamayo obviously pleased with the finished product has said it 
is unique in the world 
i dont have any problem with saying that there is no other 
mural in the world like this neither in dimension nor in artistic 
quality the artist said while the work was on temporary display 
in mexico citys museum of modern art in 1984 
the monterrey conglomerate alfa commissioned tamayo to do a 
stainedglass mural in 1981 although the theme was left up to the 
artist to decide tamayo whose fascination with outer space often 
has been revealed in his paintings and sculptures chose the 
universe 
the mural originally was intended for alfas corporate 
headquarters in this city of 28 million people a center for 
mexican private enterprise 
but 1981 was the year before the company fell into severe 
economic crisis along with the rest of mexico by the time the 
mural was finished in 1982 alfa was in financial trouble 
the mural according to the artist was put up for sale 
although the price never has been disclosed and martinez did not 
say when alfa finally purchased the mural 
i would like the government to buy the mural the 
88yearold artist said there are places to put it there are 
empty churches or a type of chapel could be built where people 
could visit simply to medidate 
however said the artist whose paintings and sculptures are on 
display throughout the world i dont think it should leave 
mexico i think its a very important work for the artistic 
heritage of mexico 
except for a brief exhibition in mexico city the giant work of 
art had been stored in a warehouse martinez said 
alfa which last year renegotiated its massive foreign debt by 
in part trading away company stock is once again making money to 
commemorate the 10th anniversary of the alfa cultural center 
monterreys handson science and techology museum built by the 
company in its heyday alfa last year began construction on the 
universe pavilion 
the 100footlong hall on the cultural center grounds is 
designed and subtly lighted to draw attention to its one work of 
art 
the building had to be conceived in a very special way so the 
stained glass could be appreciated at a distance said martinez

no more growing pains for new edition after 
years of legal and personal problems the fiveman vocal group is 
ready to enjoy its success 
being young and coming into the business you just sign your 
name on dotted lines group member ralph tresvant said recently 
in an interview we got caught out there at a young age we were 
forced to grow up a lot quicker and we found out things people 
didnt think wed ever find out 
now were back on the right track 
a new new edition can be heard on their latest album 
heartbreak original member bobby brown left in 1987 to pursue 
a solo career and was replaced by johnny gill best known for his 
duet with stacy lattislaw perfect combination 
gill says he had little trouble fitting in wed known each 
other a long time they didnt have to get to know me 
along with gill and tresvant new edition consists of ricky 
bell michael bivins and ronnie devoe although gill 22 is the 
oldest member new edition had been around long enough to have a 
wary approach towards the music business 
i dont think you really look for a friend in the music 
industry i dont think you can find one tresvant said you 
get someone that likes you and you get along with and theyre 
working for you and working with you you basically just have to 
look at them as a business relationship 
new edition then teenagers became known nationally in 1983 
with candy gmr telephone man problems arose 
maurice starr new editions former producer filed suit 
claiming he had the legal rights to their name a boston judge 
later ruled in new editions favor brown left for a solo career 
and the group did not record for a year and a half 
the legal difficulties took their toll on new edition tresvant 
wrote the song competition which appears on heartbreak 
and chronicles the groups dissension 
there was a lot of separation in the group pairing off and 
doing things that werent a group thing tresvant said i just 
wanted to write about what was happening and what we were doing to 
each other i just pictured what each person would say if he tried 
to explain how he felt 
i made it sound like an overall world problem to disguise what 
was happening but when we listened to it we knew what it really 
was 
heartbreak was produced by jimmy jam and terry lewis the 
minneapolisbased music moguls who have worked with janet jackson 
morris day human league and alexander oneal bivins says the 
group used a different approach in recording this album to be about the 
different things weve 
been through and our different personalities 
it just started from basic conversation with jimmy jam and 
terry lewis and taking our conversation and putting them into song 
form and calling it a concept album 
gill says heartbreak was not originally planned as a 
concept album 
its something that just happened if you go halfway into the 
album you wouldnt really understand it its sort of like a 
book 
gill credits jam and lewis with setting a comfortable 
atmosphere they took enough time to get to know us and they 
basically structured all the songs around us instead of just 
having us go and sing 
bell appreciated the producers direct approach they dont 
smile in your face and then behind the scenes cut some kind of deal 
or make a move theyre real up front i got a chance to be myself 
up there thats part of the feel they brought up 
jam and lewis wrote if it isnt love the albums first 
single which resembles the groups earlier hits 
that was written by them based on what they had heard from new 
edition in the past tresvant said that was the only song they 
had already written 
bivins says jam and lewis encouraged the group to produce their 
own material tresvant wrote competition and the compact disc 
version of heartbreak contains two more original songs 
before we went down into the studio with jimmy and terry they 
requested we go into the studio for a few days and just come up 
with songs written by ourselves bivins said 
terry and jimmy know the meaning of the group devoe added 
tresvant hopes heartbreak will gives fans a chance to know 
the group better thats what the album is about the new 
edition story those are songs that jam felt we should sing

afiq israeliannexed golan heights ap with the thud of 
modern artillery in the background archeologists are uncovering 
evidence that the golan heights was as fierce a battleground in 
biblical times as it is today 
the battles between the arameans of ancient syria and 
israelis were governed by the same geopolitical considerations as 
today whoever holds the high ground has a strategic advantage 
said archeologist moshe kohavi head of a tel aviv university 
expedition excavating four sites in the golan heights with the help 
of american japanese finnish and israeli volunteers 
the sites are the leviah enclosure a wedgeshaped promontory 
over the sea of galilee with gorges on three sides and high walls 
on the fourth tel hadar where a large royal winter palace has 
been unearthed on the eastern shores of the sea of galilee tel 
soreg a hilltop town on the ein gev river and rogem hiri which 
has been nicknamed the stonehenge of the golan 
afiq a kibbutz where the archeologists are based preserves the 
name of the biblical aphek the 9th century bc battleground where 
the israelite king ahabs chariots and foot soldiers defeated the 
army of ben haddad the aramean king who had conquered much of 
israel after sweeping across the golan 
ahab fought for the same advantage as we do said kohavi 
alluding to israels battles with syria for the golan in 1967 and 
1973 israel annexed the 42 by 15mile territory with its 20000 
residents in 1981 
although ancient sites dot the map of the golan most are 
unexplored the syrians put the area off limits as a military zone 
and foreign expeditions have for the most part avoided it since 
1967 because it is still disputed 
there are more ancient sites than modern ones said matti 
zohar a hebrew university of jerusalem archeologist working with 
kohavis expedition 
evidence to support the golans historical status as a 
battlefield comes mainly from the cities construction especially 
the high walls 
an iron arrowhead was found at tel hadar and a dogshaped bronze 
finial the top of a standard was found at tel soreg 
weapons and armor were precious because they were made of 
metal kohavi said it was very expensive and was not left 
lying on the battlefield what is found is usually discovered in 
caches or in tombs but this is rare 
city walls the main entrance private houses and public 
buildings at leviah indicate it was a city spread over 20 acres 
rather than a fort or large cattle pen as previously believed the 
emphasis on walls and natural defense gives insight into life 
during the bronze age 30002000 bc 
the people lived in large cities probably warlike ones and 
they chose their sites for strategic reasons kohavi said of a 
halfdozen similar sites in the golan there was apparently no 
major power to pacify the area 
these were large fortified cities that probably fought each 
other like the greek city states he said standing on the 
ancient citys stone gate and sweeping his hand toward three large 
squares stretching across about 100 yards where israeli students 
from the technion university in haifa were digging out rows of 
stone that were the walls of ancient houses 
leviah was an exciting find kohavi said because it proves 
that the golan was a thriving population center as early as the 
4th century bc and not a fringe area as had been believed 
the pottery and building style also indicated links with ancient 
lebanon 
only a few miles from syria the distant rumble of tank and 
artillery could be heard as israeli troops conducted maneuvers 
we cant escape from whats going on in todays golan said 
kohavi 
throughout the old testament period the golan heights a 
volcanic plain 1650 feet above the sea of galilee was the focus 
of a power struggle between the kings of israel and the arameans 
who were based near modernday damascus 
its importance was recognized by king david who sought to 
neutralize the power of the ruler of the land of geshur as the 
golan was known by marrying his daughter maacah their son absalom 
later led a rebellion against david 
kohavi seeking the first archeological evidence to confirm the 
biblical stories believes one seat of geshur government may have 
been tel hadar which was in a nomans land between israeli and 
syrian armies before 1967 and sits on a rise surrounded with weeds 
and barbed wire near a crowded summer resort 
archeologists have unearthed a large royal winter palace 
there on the eastern shore of the sea of galilee the palace which 
covered two acres next to what is now an amusement park was 
destroyed by fire at the end of the 11th century bc the most 
visually striking aspect of the dig are granaries in the palaces 
basement an archaeologist bent and picked up pieces of burnt grain 
more than 25 centuries old to show a reporter 
a bulldozer helped remove large basalt stones from around the 
entrance to the ancient palace among the finds were two delicately 
carved legs to a basalt stoneware pot and a perfectly preserved 
longnecked beer jug that was twisted and partially melted by the 
intense blaze 
at tel soreg midway between the sea of galilee and afiq 
volunteers sifted the remains of the settlement that was 
continuously inhabitated for 2000 years and is believed by some to 
have been the biblical aphek a possibility kohavi discounts 
because it was too small to match the biblical descriptions 
the golans battles even touched tel soreg though it was out of 
the path of armies marching across the plateau two miles away 
when the arameans and israelites were fighting the residents of 
tel soreg built a high wall for defense in the 9th and 8th 
centuries bc he said 
zohar is trying to unravel the mystery of rogem hiri which the 
druse arabs have named the stone heap of the wild cat 
the four concentric circles of stone walls with a 6yardhigh 
mound of stones in the middle has been likened to stonehenge the 
neolithic stone circle in england like stonehenge it may have 
been an astronomical observatory the entrance marks the point of 
sunrise on the longest day of the year 
it has to be a burial site said zohar standing on the 
central heap of black volcanic stones the coneshaped core had 
collapsed and the original structure resembled a stepped pyramid 
like those found in ancient egypt 
pottery found there this year dates the site to about 3000 bc

aspirin sales jumped 41 percent for a few weeks 
earlier this year not because of a rash of headaches 
a study of more than 22000 male doctors had shown that taking a 
single aspirin every other day could cut heart attack risk in half 
the study was one of a series of recent reports showing for the 
first time that doctors are able not only to treat heart attacks 
but also to prevent them 
in the most recent report doctors found that one aspirin tablet 
and a single dose of a clotdissolving drug given within 24 hours 
can dramatically cut the risk of a second fatal heart attack 
without the treatment patients had a 13 percent chance of dying 
from a second heart attack within five weeks the researchers 
found with the treatment the figure dropped to 8 percent 
the real discovery is that treatment for patients is going to 
reduce inhospital mortality substantially says richard peto of 
oxford university one of the studys authors 
heart disease is the nations leading cause of death by far 
the national center for health statistics reports that 762820 
americans died of heart disease in 1987 
to put it another way of the 2127000 american who died that 
year more than one in three died of heart disease this does not 
include those who died of bloodvessel diseases such as strokes 
the drugs most responsible for the recent success in preventing 
heart attacks are the new clotdissolvers and that old standby 
aspirin 
the usual cause of heart attacks is a blockage of the coronary 
arteries which supply the heart muscle with oxygenrich blood the 
blockage arises from the buildup of fats cholesterol and clotted 
blood 
clotdissolvers break up clots thus restoring blood flow 
aspirin interferes with aspects of the clotting process helping to 
prevent clot formation in the first place 
the limited sales of the clotdissolving drugs in the united 
states show that many doctors are still not using them despite 
their proven success but that is beginning to change 
some doctors predict that in the nottoodistant future these 
drugs will be judged so safe that they will be administered 
routinely by paramedics in ambulances before suspected heart attack 
victims even reach the hospital 
we have to know how to respond quickly and we have to have 
the courage to use these drugs in the absence of definitive 
diagnosis says dr burton sobel of washington university in st 
louis a pioneer in the testing of the clotdissolvers 
the most important thing we can do is teach patients in 
advance about the value of early treatment he says 
while most public attention has focused on this new ability to 
prevent heart attacks researchers have also made important 
progress in speeding the recovery of patients who survive heart 
attacks 
researchers at the university of michigan recently determined 
that some heart attack victims can be released from the hospital as 
soon as three days after their heart attacks most heart attacks 
victims are kept in the hospital for at least seven to 10 days 
the patients given early discharge were able to return to work 
two weeks sooner than others in the study group after six months 
not one death was recorded in the earlydischarge group the 
researchers concluded that perhaps 15 percent of heart attacks 
victims could be safely discharged after three days 
in july stanford university doctors found that workers who went 
back to their jobs about seven weeks after their heart attacks did 
at least as well as workers who went back after a more typical 
convalescence of about 10 or 11 weeks 
all of these advances come at a time when public health experts 
are increasingly emphasizing the role of good health and good 
nutrition in lowering heart disease risk 
early next year the american heart association seal of approval 
will begin appearing on foods that are low in fat and cholesterol 
and therefore can help reduce heart disease risk 
us surgeon general c everett koop in july issued his first 
report on nutrition calling on americans to lower their 
consumption of fats and to eat more vegetables fruits fish 
poultry and whole grains 
the report has been likened to the first surgeon generals report 
on smoking issued in 1964 which focused public attention on 
smokings hazards koops recommendations largely echo those of the 
american heart association but they should help carry the message 
to many more people 
progress in research on heart disease is making clear that the 
heart attack is no longer a mysterious killer that strikes without 
warning and cannot be defended against 
much can be done to prevent heart attacks great improvements 
are being made in treatments and recovery is faster than ever 
before 
the use of a clotdissolver and aspirin could alone save 
25000 lives a year in the united states doctors say 
these results says dr peter sleight of oxford university 
will change medical practice worldwide

heart attack patients often benefit from getting up and around 
sooner being released from the hospital earlier and exercising 
according to a recent study in the journal of the american medical 
association 
even so heart attack patients generally take 60 days to 90 days 
to get back to work and physicians recommendations concerning 
return to work are largely based on subjective judgments that have 
changed little since 1973 the study said 
the study led by dr charles dennis of the stanford cardiac 
rehabilitation program in palo alto calif evaluated 201 men who 
had suffered heart attacks without other medical problems subjects 
were divided into two groups those receiving usual care and those 
receiving a special medical evaluation to determine fitness for 
work 
evaluations were performed three weeks after the patients heart 
attack by a team of heart experts who administered a treadmill test 
and used data on previous victims to estimate the risk each subject 
would have of experiencing further heart trouble 
the team then advised each patients doctor of the findings so 
the doctor could make a more informed recommendation on when the 
patient could resume work 
the study found that unless otherwise informed doctors 
generally estimated risk as much higher than it was and patients 
perceptions of risk mirrored those of their doctors 
for instance doctors typically estimated patients in the study 
had a 20 percent chance of suffering another fatal or nonfatal 
heart attack within six months while heartteam evaluations 
typically found a 5 percent risk and the real risk turned out to be 
35 percent the researchers said 
patients in the usualcare group were told by their doctors they 
could go back to work at 60 days and did so at a median of 75 days 
the study said 
patients in the specialevaluation group were told by their 
doctors they could return at 48 days and did so at a median of 51 
days representing a 32 percent reduction in the convalescent 
period the study said 
this 32 percent reduction was associated with 2102 of 
additional earned salary per patient in the six months after the 
heart attack the researchers said 
the study found no significant difference in the rate of 
subsequent heart attacks or other heart trouble between the two 
groups 
patients performing manual labor returned to work no later than 
those performing sedentary jobs or lightphysical labor the 
researchers said

high blood cholesterol a prime factor in stroke and heart 
attacks may begin in childhood according to a number of 
nutritionists and pediatricians 
they recommend that families in which parents or grandparents 
have suffered from early heart attacks or strokes have their 
childrens cholesterol level tested at age 2 or soon after 
for those with a high level of cholesterol a low fat diet that 
substitutes monounsaturated polyunsaturated fats for saturated fat 
sources should lower cholesterol levels some extra thought and 
preplanning of diet can ease parental anxiety about the high fat 
high cholesterol snack food available 
some suggestions from the schneider childrens hospital of long 
island jewish medical center new hyde park ny 
reserve special snacks to be consumed at special 
events like birthday parties or ballpark trips 
serve a low fat meal before or after the event 
bring picnic or snack food from home 
substitute pretzels for potato chips a cola instead of a 
milkshake veal or chicken frankfurters instead of beef hot dogs 
airpopped popcorn without the oil

only 6 percent of the adults surveyed in 32 
states last year could recall what their cholesterol levels were 
reports the national center for disease control 
people dont know their numbers says dr patrick l 
remington a cdc cholesterol specialist weve got a long way to 
go to get people to know their numbers 
the federal governments behavioral risk factor surveillance 
system regularly asks people about their health and behavior last 
year for the first time interviewers asked randomly selected 
adults in 32 states and the district of columbia about their 
cholesterol 
less than half the respondents 47 percent had ever had a 
cholesterol check at all less than half of those people or just 
19 percent overall said they had been told what their cholesterol 
level was and of those people fewer than onethird or only 6 
percent overall remembered what the level was 
in the past a doctor might do a cholesterol check during a 
checkup look at the reading and tell the patient youre 
fine remington said what were encouraging is for patients 
to say id like to know what my number is 
and not only should you know your number but you should know 
what it means 
a cholesterol level of below 200 measured in milligrams per 
deciliter of blood is considered desirable according to the 
cdc more than 200 is considered borderline high and over 240 
is high 
evidence about the links between cholesterol and heart disease 
has grown in the past decade the cdc noted in its report 
government researchers believe a 25 percent reduction in 
cholesterol can cut a persons risk of heart disease in half 
remington said cholesterol specialists want people to know their 
exact numbers to avoid misconceptions an old rule of thumb said 
that anything under a figure of 200pluspatientage was ok but 
thats obviously passe he said citing the current standards 
in the 32 states and the district of columbia the percentage of 
people knowing their cholesterol ranged from 1 percent in new 
mexico to a high of 9 percent in maine maryland and washington 
state 
the percentage of respondents who had ever had a cholesterol 
check at all ranged from 29 percent in new mexico to 57 percent in 
maryland 
the margin of polling error for the surveys differed from state 
to state and question to question but ranged from 1 percent to 4

children who breakfast on readytoeat 
cold cereals tend to be better nourished than those who breakfast 
on other foods according to a study of hundreds of 1 to 
5yearolds 
university of missouri nutritionist gretchen hill said her study 
shows kids can get a good breakfast on their own by getting the 
cereal box and some milk 
hill who presented her study during the annual meeting of the 
federation of american societies for experimental biology in las 
vegas said the research didnt suggest that cold cereal was the 
only good breakfast 
parents who feed their children wellbalanced breakfasts 
fruit toast lowfat milk some bacon and only three eggs weekly 
shouldnt change she said 
but if youre lazy and have to choose between doughnuts and 
cereal provide the cereal especially with lowfat milk she 
said the data was very clear that there are a lot of nutrients 
in that breakfast they might not get enough of in some other 
breakfast 
hill used data collected in l985 by the us department of 
agriculture for her study of 27 dietary components including 
calories protein vitamins minerals and fiber consumed during 
all three meals and snacks by 548 children ages 1 to 5 nationwide 
eleven skipped breakfast of the others about half ate 
readytoeat cereals the half that didnt eat cereals wasnt 
divided as to whether the children ate balanced breakfasts or not 
because hill simply wanted to know how the average cereal eater did 
compared with other children 
cereal eaters tended to receive significantly more vitamins a 
and b12 thiamine riboflavin niacin pyridoxine iron folic acid 
and zinc than noncereal eaters or breakfast skippers hill said 
cereal eaters also ate significantly less cholesterol and fat 
she said all three groups tended to get adequate protein and 
carbohydrate but breakfast skippers risked lowenergy and future 
bone ailments because they failed to meet recommended daily amounts 
of thiamine calcium and vitamin a and ate less fiber pyridoxine 
calcium magnesium zinc and copper 
hills study was financed by the missouri agricultural 
experiment station without support from cereal manufacturers she 
said 
liebman cautioned that a link between breakfast cereals and 
better overall nutrition doesnt prove cause and effect its 
possible these kids overall ate less fat and cholesterol because 
they came from families that are more nutritionconscious

most people dont really know what the role of the school nurse 
is says a nursing educator who believes finding out can be 
helpful to students parents and teachers alike 
i think a lot of people dont have any idea what the role of 
the school nurse is says ruth young seideman a former school 
nurse who now is an associated professor of nursing at the 
university of oklahoma health sciences center in oklahoma city 
its not as obvious as that of a teacher 
school nurses she says dont spend their time waiting for a 
chance to hand out a bandaid but on health monitoring counseling 
and disseminating information 
we do not distribute drugs except in rare cases with a 
doctors order she says so while we will do cpr 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation or distribute aspirin actually 
treating patients is the exception rather than the rule 
a major part of the job she says is to serve as a referral 
source a resource person to put the parents and teachers in 
touch with health care providers 
the problems of a school nurse vary with the ages of the 
students and the environment of the school district she says 
in elementary schools the most common duties are identifying 
communicable diseases screen for health problems and coping with 
playground accidents 
in the high school setting there are more delicate situations 
of pregnancy sexuallytransmitted diseases and birth control says 
seideman 
dental problems are there in all ages she says 
a constant project is teaching good nutrition and many school 
nurses go into the classroom to provide information that they hope 
will be passed along to parents connected with that says 
seideman the older girls often get preoccupied with their 
weight and then you need to be alert to symptoms of eating 
disorders like anorexia and bulimia 
not everything is a crisis however there are always a 
few mathgenerated headaches she says when they come down 
with the daily headache just in time for fourthperiod math

feel like youre falling apart going to pieces arms and legs 
feel like jelly bothered by headaches neck and back pains 
these may be symptoms of anxiety a fairly common and treatable 
psychiatric disorder that in most extreme forms can be disabling 
says a duke university medical center psychiatrist 
perhaps as many as 20 million americans may suffer unknowingly 
from anxiety says william wk zung duke professor of psychiatry 
zung said a recent study found 20 percent of 739 consecutive 
patients seen in a family medicine clinic had significant symptoms 
of anxiety 
the ninemonth study was surprising because it suggested that 
anxiety may be more prevalent in the general population than 
previously believed more common even than depression he says 
its something that family practitioners should be on the lookout 
for 
the study also found that symptoms of anxiety tended to increase 
with age and seemed to affect more women than men 
duke university in durham nc recently started an anxiety 
disorders program 
anxiety he says can disrupt sleep upset the stomach symptoms 
may include shakes and aches dizziness and sweating 
a fear of flying or other phobias panic attacks and 
posttraumatic stress disorder are some of the forms anxiety takes 
says zung 
generalized anxiety disorder involves fundamental biologic 
changes that result from a patients attempt to cope with and adapt 
to stress zung says stress that may be internal external or 
both 
anxiety can be treated with medication he says as well as 
psychotherapy behavioral therapy and biofeedback

despite greater awareness of exercise and healthy foods many 
americans remain significantly overweight according to federal 
researchers who say most government nutritional goals are unlikely 
to be met 
everybody knows what is required to lose weight yet the 
prevalence of overweight doesnt seem to change much said dr 
marion nestle of the us office of disease prevention and health 
promotion in washington 
the national centers for disease control in atlanta reviewed 
the progress toward the governments 15 toppriority goals for 
american nutrition in 1990 including raising public knowledge of 
the effects of salt and lowering average bloodcholesterol levels 
substantial progress has been made in several areas and 
three of the goals will be fully met researchers said 
but despite the progress americans will probably fall short of 
eight major goals including that of getting people to lose weight 
said ms nestle whose office helped prepare the report 
the research that relates poor diet to disease is now 
incontrovertible she said its really time now to start 
looking at ways to implement the recommendations that everybody is 
familiar with ways to improve the nutritional status of the 
population 
the goals that will likely not be met she said are 
having less than 10 percent of american men and 17 percent of 
american women over the significantly overweight level defined 
as more than 20 percent over desired weight 
having 50 percent of the overweight population on a 
weightloss program combining diet and exercise the cdc said 
recent surveys show half the nations overweight people are indeed 
trying to lose weight but only half are using both diet and 
exercise 
cutting the average adult level of harmful serum cholesterol 
below the 200 count in a 197680 survey average cholesterol 
levels were 211 for women and 215 for men down from 214 and 217 in 
197174 that rate of decline is not as fast as it should be 
ms nestle said 
having at least threefourths of all mothers breastfeeding 
their babies at the time they leave the hospital a 1984 survey put 
the figure at 61 percent up from 45 percent in 1978 
having all packaged foods labeled with useful calorie and 
nutrient information such is the case in 55 percent of packaged 
foods up from 42 percent in 1978 ms nestle said 
including nutrition education in the required school 
curriculum in all states by 1985 only 12 states had such a 
requirement the cdc said 
the three objectives that researchers think will be fully met 
she said are 
having more than 75 percent of the population aware of 
nutritional risks for conditions such as heart disease and high 
blood pressure fats and salt and tooth decay betweenmeal 
sweets awareness already runs as high as 90 percent in some 
categories the cdc report said 
having 90 percent of us adults aware that to lose weight 
they must eat fewer calories or increase physical activity or 
both the percentage was 73 in 1985 and is rising quickly ms 
nestle said 
implementation of a comprehensive national nutrition status 
monitoring system it is already in place the cdc reported

too many school lunches rate a c grade 
because of their high fat content a consumer nutrition group has 
said urging cafeterias to serve healthfully modified meals 
such as chili atop baked potatoes instead of hot dogs 
ellen haas executive director of public voice for food and 
health policy said her group spotted encouraging trends toward 
fresh fruit and vegetables in a survey of school menus 
but she said the main courses served in school cafeterias far 
too often are fried foods and other dishes high in saturated fat 
our young children are a captive audience we have an 
opportunity here haas said weve got to establish lifestyles 
that have healthy eating habits 
the 37 billion school lunch program serving some 27 million 
children is run by the agriculture department surplus commodities 
purchased by usda account for 20 percent of the foods used in the 
program 
therein lies the root of the problem according to public voice 
because the commodities are often high in fat sugar or sodium 
congress has compounded the problem by bowing to the milk 
producers lobby and requiring that schools serve whole milk with 
lowfat milk optional it said 
public voice recommended among other things that usda set 
limits on the amount of fat sodium and sugar permitted in school 
lunches and distribute healthier commodities to schools 
but suzanne s harris deputy assistant secretary of agriculture 
for food and consumer services said in a statement that it would 
be irresponsible to let commodities purchased by the government 
as required by law go unused 
furthermore she said the scientific community does not 
support setting absolute levels for sugar fat or sodium at this 
time because current recommendations regarding children are 
controversial 
nutrition strategies warranted for the general adult 
population may actually be harmful to children particularly 
lowincome children during periods of growth and development 
harris said 
however haas said the national science foundation the national 
institutes of health and the american heart association agree that 
fat should not constitute more than 30 percent of a childs daily 
caloric intake and she said the average school lunch contains 39 
percent fat 
public voice listed several examples of traditional menus heavy 
on fried chicken and fish mashed and fried potatoes and sweet 
prepared deserts the group compared those with healthfully 
modified menus adopted by some school districts 
for example in kennesaw ga students got baked chicken 
breasts with lemon and garlic steamed broccoli and carrots a 
homemade whole wheat roll and fresh fruit and in denver one meal 
was a baked potato topped with chili accompanied by raw broccoli 
and carrots and sweet potato pie 
we hear complaints that students wont eat this stuff haas 
said we just dont buy that 
some school districts won praise for serving lowfat milk and 
homemade lowfat salad dressings buying the ingredients themselves 
to substitute for higherfat commodities from usda 
haas urged the department to help keep nutritious meals 
affordable by adapting the commodities program to more closely meet 
usdas own 1980 dietary guidelines for example she said it could 
offer schools whole potatoes and plain chicken rather than potato 
rounds and breaded chicken ready for frying

a recent survey indicates that despite a lack of regular 
exercise among the nations youth children do get involved in 
physical fitness when its fun 
the survey confirms what weve known all along children will 
participate in physical activities as long as they have fun says 
jim johnson national director of hersheys national track and 
field youth program 
the survey of more than 6000 participants in the hershey youth 
program reported that nearly 80 percent got involved in fitness

percent feel a high level of enjoyment when they exercise or play 
sports with friends 
its more fun to be fit together says dean tice executive 
director of the national recreation and parks association 
youngsters enjoy playing on a team or participating in group 
activities because they develop a sense of camaraderie with their 
peers not because they win thats why its important to promote 
youth fitness at the local levels through parks schools and 
recreation departments 
were facing a youth fitness problem in america says ash 
hayes executive director of the presidents council on fitness and 
sports studies show that 50 percent of girls ages 6 to 17 and 30 
percent of the boys cant run a mile in less than 10 minutes 
but he says kids definitely respond to fitness when its fun 
and satisfying our challenge is to get more kids motivated and 
continue to encourage those youngsters who are active

of the hershey national track and field youth program a random 
sampling drawn from 21 states were polled at their state final 
meets

would last a lifetime 
less than half 44 percent thought their involvement in 
sports would help them improve their grades in school 
a little more than half 514 percent said they often 
exercise with friends while 312 percent said they are active in 
team or league sports 
more than 87 percent felt that gym class is lots of fun 
and they look forward to it 
jogging and running was the most popular sport of the girls 
followed by swimming basketball was the favorite of the boys

hearing aids and diagnostic equipment 
usually family members get tired of hearing what did you 
say they persuade the person to come in for testing and the best 
way to find out if you have a hearing loss that warrants assistance 
is to simply get your hearing tested by a hearing health

theres a difference in the fat cells of men and women which 
may explain why men often have pot bellies while women often have 
big hips and beefy thighs according to recent research 
studies conducted at rockefeller university in new york have 
found differences between the sexes in both the makeup and number 
of these cells 
they show that typically women have more fat cells than men do 
in their thighs hips and bottoms but the fat cells in mens 
tummies are more likely than womens to accumulate fat 
learning how to tinker with the biological controls that rule 
how fat cells take in and give up their cargo could open new ways 
for making people slim and healthy 
the latest research conducted by dr rudolph l leibel was 
presented at a meeting of the american heart association 
according to one estimate 34 million american adults are 
overweight and a third of them are severely obese although too 
much fat is unhealthy studies have shown that where the flab rests 
on the body is at least as important as how much excess poundage it 
carries 
in general pot bellies are associated with a higher risk of 
heart disease and diabetes but extra weight down lower on the body 
is not linked with these diseases 
experts believe this may be one reason why men have a higher 
risk of heart attacks than women 
leibel said that women need to carry about 80000 calories of 
fat in order to get pregnant this fuel is necessary to carry and 
feed a baby the most efficient place to store this energy is the 
lower part of the body 
carrying extra fat in the abdomen is dangerous he said because 
it interferes with the breakdown of insulin in the liver this in 
turn raises the blood pressure and causes diabetes

business travel may be hazardous to your health 
while 20 percent of all travelers suffer some illness while 
abroad according to figures from the national centers for disease 
control business travelers are less likely to take proper 
preventive measures than other travelers 
as a group business people are generally less prepared for 
healthrelated issues when traveling than vacationers students or 
missionaries says dr kenneth r dardick a university of 
connecticut clinical assistant professor of medicine 
more often than not he says the business traveler is 
preoccupied with the big meeting seminar or interview than with 
his or her actual destination while a vacationer will 
investigate the climate the potential for contracting disease and 
other factors and either decide to change their itinerary or to 
take the necessary precautions 
he says the two most common areas of concern for business 
travelers are environmentinduced conditions such as jet lag 
motion sickness and sunburn and organismrelated conditions such 
as malaria and rabies 
to prevent jet lag he advises patients not to drink alcohol 
smoke or overeat while traveling and whenever possible arrive at 
their destination a day before their appointments to catch up on 
sleep 
for organismrelated conditions he advises business travelers 
to check with their doctors before leaving on a trip and check 
with them again upon returning 
its always best to catch these things early and to begin 
treatment immediately he says many conditions dont manifest 
themselves until much later and begin with a slight feeling of 
discomfort 
traveling need not be a debilitating experience for business 
travelers he says make the best of your trip dont let it get 
the best of you he says you and your business will be better 
off 
another potential hazard for business travelers is lack of 
exercise whether on a plane or on the ground in a strange city 
nancy burstein author of the executive body a fitness 
book and president of fitness plus corporate fitness consultants 
has some advice 
on long plane flights get out of your seat once an hour and 
walk the aisle 
while in your seat flex your feet and rotate your ankles 
simulate walking by sitting up straight lifting your knees 
slightly and shifting your weight from leg to leg stretch your 
arms above your head 
drink lots of water and avoid alcohol on the plane 
take advantage of hotel facilities for exercise from weight 
rooms and gyms to tennis courts and spas bring your bathing suit 
walk a few blocks from your hotel before hailing a taxi to 
your meeting

children from rural areas are more anxious about hospital stays 
than those from urban areas according to a new university of 
alabama study with black male children from rural areas 
apparently suffering the greatest degree of stress 
the study also reported that all children when hospitalized show 
some degree of stress but preschool children ages 3 to 6 are 
most vulnerable 
anxiety ratings before hopital admission were not statistically 
different for rural or urban children according to researchers 
but were vastly different at discharge the rate of children 
showing worse than average adjustment to the hospital was three 
times higher in the rural group with 61 percent of urban children 
worse than average but 20 percent of the rural group in that 
category 
all the children were exposed to experiences that would 
familiarize them and their parents with hospital and medical 
procedures also they all took part in hospital playroom and 
inroom experiences to help ease tensions yet rural children 
still exhibited more psychological upset than urban children 
the study was conducted by peggy jessee instructor in human 
development and family life martha strickland assistant professor 
and director of the child development center carmen hudson 
instructor in the center and dr james d leeper associate 
professor in the department of community medicine

the percentage of elderly people confined to nursing homes is 
remaining stable even though the raw numbers are rising because of 
an aging population according to health united states 1987 a 
report issued by the department of health and human services 
there were 13 million nursing home residents at least 65 years 
of age in 1985 up 200000 from 1977 when the last nursing home 
data were collected 
despite growing political attention to the issue of financing 
longterm care for the elderly the figures in the 207page 
health united states 1987 report underscore that a tiny 
minority of all elderly people actually wind up in nursing homes 
the report notes that the 1985 nursing home population reflects 
about 1 percent of americans 6574 years old being confined to 
institutions and about 22 percent of those 85 years and older it

dark red plumes atop the tall grain 
amaranth sway in the breeze at one end of this unusual field and 
long ears of brilliant blue corn poke out of shucks near the other 
end 
between them tiny white flowers hide buckwheat for pancake 
flour tough green pods protect cotton for cloth and towering 
stems support giant yellow sunflowers for snacks and birdfeed 
the parkland college cropsoftheworld demonstration plot 
offers students and visitors a chance to see as many as 80 plant 
varieties each year 
they range from common central illinois crops like soybeans to 
popular oriental crops like mung beans 
our goal is to demonstrate as many different crops from around 
the world as we can said kyle wittler chairman of parklands 
business and agriindustries department we use it to teach our 
students and to show people in the community what these plants look 
like 
the unusual plots a pair of 300foot beds with a couple of 
rows of each crop were created 14 years ago when parkland moved 
to its permanent campus on the west edge of champaign 
there is corn but its nothing like illinois leading 
commercial crop instead there is corn for making brooms corn for 
popping south american flint corn for milling multicolored 
ornamental corn for decorating and an ancient strain of corn in 
which the kernels grow in individual green pods on the ears 
people just drop in and they are surprised by the number and 
the variety of crops we have said wittler the ones with a lot 
of color really attract attention 
its showy red flowers make the amaranth popular with some 
gardeners in the united states said wittler but in central and 
south america the plant is raised for small seed that can used in 
livestock feed 
saflower raised for its cooking oil produces beautiful orange 
and yellow blooms flax grown for linseed oil and fiber is topped 
with tiny bluish flowers rape also raised for cooking oil is 
covered with delicate yellow flowers 
the plots also feature traditional midwestern crops and 
vegetables wheat oats tomatoes turnips and peppers and there 
are varieties of forage kentucky bluegrass red clover and fescue 
parkland obtains the seed to plant the unusual crops from 
dealers across the country and from the us department of 
agriculture plant introduction stations some seed is harvested at 
parkland and replanted 
occasionally a crop proves to be unsuitable for central 
illinois tobacco and rice have been dropped from the plots 
ive tended to eliminate those weve had trouble getting to 
grow here said wittler 
but there are enough interesting plants to attract even 
professionals in agriculture 
it is amazing the interest said bob ulbrich director of 
parklands land laboratory farmers come by and theyre not 
interested in our conventional crops they want to see these 
unusual ones

south koreas trade surplus with the 
united states shrank 157 percent in the first seven months of the 
year the government reported monday 
for the sevenmonth period ending july 31 south koreas trade 
surplus fell to 466 billion from 553 billion in the same period 
in 1987 the korea foreign trade association said 
government officials attributed the slowdown to koreas 
revaluation of the won currency against the us dollar 
in addition south korea also has been under pressure from the 
united states to reduce its trade surplus and has faced stiffer 
us import sanctions officials said 
korean merchandise exports to the united states between january 
and july rose 108 percent to 1139 billion from the same period 
last year while imports from america shot up 415 percent to 673 
billion the report said 
exports to the united states were led by electronics which rose 
17 percent in the first seven months of this year followed by 
textiles which rose 4 percent 
in july alone koreas trade surplus with the united states fell 
184 percent from the same period a year ago to 765 million the 
association reported 
meanwhile korean exports to japan have risen sharply helped by 
a strong japanese yen which makes korean goods more competitive 
there in terms of price 
koreas trade deficit with japan in the januaryjuly period 
narrowed to 249 billion down 307 percent from the same period 
last year 
korean exports to japan jumped 522 percent to 633 billion 
while imports from japan increased 138 percent to 882 billion 
koreas monthly trade shortfall with japan in july was listed at 
372 million down 39 percent from a year ago korean exports to 
japan in july rose 498 percent to 961 million while imports from 
japan went up only 65 percent to 133 billion 
koreas reduced trade gaps with the united states and japan 
partly reflected this countrys trade policy calling for the 
correction of its trade imbalances with the them by shifting some 
imports away from japan to the united states

matsushita electric industrial co is lining up on 
the side of american telephone amp telegraph co and sun microsystems 
inc in a highstakes competition over a critical piece of computer 
software 
matsushita said monday that a close us business ally has 
concluded a licensing agreement with atampt and sun to use their 
sparc computer architecture in a new engineering workstation 
the sparc design is tailored for use with atampts latest version 
of unix unix is a base layer of software that allows programs to 
run on a variety of computer models 
the version of unix developed by atampt with sun has been 
challenged by an industry group that says the popular software 
should not be controlled by one company that group includes such 
powerhouses as international business machines corp digital 
equipment corp and hewlettpackard co 
matsushitas decision to jump into the fastgrowing workstation 
market ends an effective 24year absence from the field of 
highpowered computers workstations are fast computers with strong 
graphics capabilities that are typically used by scientists and 
engineers 
matsushita said it plans to build the central processing unit 
for the workstations designed by solbourne computer inc of 
longmont colo and solbourne would supply the rest of the 
workstations components and sell it under its own brand name in 
the united states 
matsushita owns 52 percent of solbourne according to mike 
kitadeya a spokesman for matsushitas us subsidiary 
solbourne hopes to put a workstation on sale in the united 
states early next year kitadeya said 
matsushitas decision to enter the fray over unix though 
indirectly for the time being on the side of sparc could affect 
the opinions of other japanese electronics makers

grain and soybean futures opened substantially 
lower today on the chicago board of trade apparently on fears that 
a high number of delivery notices will be posted against the 
september contracts 
wednesday is first notice day for september grain and soybean 
contracts meaning it is the first opportunity for sellers to 
declare their intent to actually deliver commodities to those 
holding buy or long positions 
a high number of delivery notices would indicate the potential 
exists for a large increase in supplies of grains and soybeans on 
the open market 
but few players enter the futures markets with the intention of 
taking delivery of physical commodities many of those holding long 
positions will be forced to liquidate their holdings to avoid 
taking delivery 
weekend showers in the midwestern croplands added to the bearish 
sentiment as did continuing slack export demand traders said 
we need an increase in demand and were not getting it said 
victor lespinasse a trader with the investment firm dean witter 
reynolds inc 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents to 4 cents lower with the

commercial credit group inc has reached 
a definitive agreement to acquire primerica corp in a 
cashandstock deal valued at about 17 billion the companies 
announced today 
under terms of an agreement approved by both companies boards 
of directors shareholders would receive one share of commercial 
credit common stock plus 7 in cash for each share of primerica 
based on commercial credits closing price of 2525 on the new 
york stock exchange friday the deal has an indicated value of 
about 17 billion 
the combined companies will operate under the primerica name 
according to a statement 
primerica a greenwich connbased financial services and 
directmarketing company is the parent of the languishing smith 
barney harris upham amp co investment firm 
commercial credit headquartered in baltimore is involved in 
several facets of consumer credit including lending property and 
casualty insurance and credit cards 
commercial credits chairman sanford i weill will serve as 
chairman chief executive officer and president of the combined 
company primericas chairman chief executive and president 
gerald tsai jr will serve as a director and chairman of the 
executive committee of the new company 
upon completion of the transaction tsai will become the largest 
individual shareholder of the new company the statement said 
with the transaction we are creating an exciting growth 
opportunity for the shareholders and customers of both commerical 
credit and primerica weill said the combined companies will 
have all the components including a strong financial base to 
build a powerful and dynamic financial service organization 
the companies plan to sell fingerhut corp primericas largest 
specialty retailing unit and focus more closely on financial 
services 
tsai called the merger a logical next step having 
successfully transformed primerica from a manufacturingbased firm 
into a major financial services company we are poised for a 
signficant move to a higher plateau 
primerica originally was known as american can co but tsai 
changed the name to reflect its transformation from a manufacturing 
concern to a financial services company 
the company which got out of the can business last year owns 
insurance and direct marketing companies in addition to its 
troubled smith barney brokerage and investment unit which was 
acquired last year for 750 million 
primerica attributed its overall flat secondquarter earnings to 
the weak performance by smith barney which suffered from lower 
trading volume underwriting and commission revenues in the wake of 
the stock market crash last october 
faced with dwindling returns in its municipal bond department 
smith barney recently dismissed five top executives from its public 
finance division the firm has seen its ranking as an underwriter 
of taxexempt bonds slip from second place last year to fifth this 
year 
tsai reportedly had been quietly looking to sell smith barney 
for some time but was unable to find a buyer interested in paying 
near what he paid for it 
under tsais direction primerica embarked on a strategy of 
simplifying its operations and strengthening its financial position 
to that end the company announced in april that it would sell 
musicland group inc the nations largest specialty retailer of 
prerecorded music and video home entertainment products and three 
of its insurance subsidiaries in deals that would net about 700 
million tsai said at the time that the proceeds from the sales 
would be used to reduce debt 
based on assets primerica is much larger than commercial credit 
it has 35 billion under management compared with the 4 billion 
commercial credit reported in total assets at the end of june 
in early trading today primericas stock today fell 87 cents 
to 2925 per share 
the companies said the transaction to be completed by yearend 
is subject to the approval of the shareholders of both companies 
and other regulatory approvals

total of 300 million a year over the next three years officials 
said

also a resolve that now were going to be lean and mean so theres

tandy corp said monday it has no plans to cut 
back its operations in south korea in spite of labor unrest 
including an episode last month in which six women employees were 
beaten up by a group of men from a rival labor group 
three of the women who were beaten were taken to hospitals for 
treatment and the 16 men who were identified as participants in 
the attack were immediately fired tandy spokesman ed juge said 
monday he said the women were able to return to work quickly 
juge confirmed published reports that the company recently 
transferred production of some items from south korea to taiwan 
but said it involved only about a dozen items out of 200 to 300 and 
was designed only to help the company stay on production schedules 
he said it would not result in any layoffs 
we think this will all blow over said juge who is tandys 
director of market planning 
robert mcclure president of the companys tandy electronics 
unit which oversees the korean plant has said the company would 
only reassess its presence in korea if there were no signs of 
progress in the next few years juge said 
the beating episode at tandys plant in masan south korea in 
midjuly involved rival labor groups not tandy management juge 
said he said it was sparked by a previous incident that occurred 
away from the tandy plant in which several men who attempted to 
invade a womenonly labor meeting were beaten up by some male 
bodyguards 
the next day apparently in retalation a group of men beat up 
the six women juge said he said the episode was an outgrowth of 
the overheated labor situation in korea and had nothing to do 
with tandy

the mexican government in a bid to ease its 
overwhelming economic dependence on the united states is looking 
across the pacific for closer commercial ties 
having a coastline of 7000 kilometers 4300 miles on the 
pacific we have to participate in this great market in this great 
development we have long been interested in it deputy trade 
secretary luis bravo aguilera said in an interview 
he acknowledged the success stories of far eastern economies 
have influenced the development strategy of president miguel de la 
madrid who has pioneered efforts to liberalize mexicos foreign 
trade 
we are looking to increase our markets there has been an 
important development in nations throughout the pacific bravo 
aguilera said 
the interest in the far east comes at a time when de la madrid 
is systematically dismantling trade barriers the government has 
freed about 80 percent of mexican imports from official permit 
requirements eliminated inflationary and protectionist official 
prices for imports and substantially reduced import tariffs 
mexico already conducts about twothirds of its trade with the 
united states officials here fear that with the market opening 
that dependence could increase unless the government actively 
strengthens its commercial ties elsewhere 
the logical choice the pacific particularly japan and south 
korea the government is actively encouraging more japanese 
investment in and trade with mexico 
japan was mexicos secondlargest trading partner in 1987 but 
at 3 billion japanesemexican trade last year was only a tenth of 
that between mexico and the united states accounting for 10 
percent of total mexican trade flows 
japanese investment in mexico also trails only that by us 
firms but totals only 170 million or 69 percent of total 
foreign investment in the country 
we are looking to increase our markets and believe that 
countries like japan and korea that have ample commercial trade 
surpluses are those that can buy many mexican products bravo 
aguilera said the government hopes to double its exports to japan 
in the next two years 
reflecting his governments interest in the far east de la 
madrid visited japan and china in 1986 in july a group of mexican 
businessmen went to japan to pitch investment opportunities in 
mexico 
japanese foreign minister sousuke uno arrived monday for a 
fourday official visit to mexico highlighted by the 100th 
anniversary of the signing of the mexicojapanese friendship and 
trade treaty 
in april the government created the mexican commission on the 
pacific basin an interdepartmental working group whose aim is to 
foster economic ties with the region 
the japanese are studying what additional mexican goods are 
feasible for import bravo aguilar said mexico currently sends 
silver salt coffee auto parts chemicals and petrochemicals 
products to the asian nation 
mexico also hopes to join in 1989 the pacific economic 
coordination conference which regulates regional trade 
japanese firms also have taken advantage of mexicos maquiladora 
industry foreign producers ship product components dutyfree to 
mexican plants for assembly availing themselves of cheap labor 
costs in the country the highest minimum wage in mexico is 
roughly 350 a day the completed products are then shipped abroad 
for sale 
producers pay export taxes only on the labor costs or value 
added to the product 
the maquiladora plants proximity to the vast consumer market in 
the united states is another selling point for far eastern 
producers 
the government created in 1986 fiscal incentives for foreign 
investment in mexican industrial projects it also permits 
investors to maintain dollar accounts for commercial transactions 
within a 12mile zone along the northern border and all of baja 
california 
in an effort to attract the maquiladoras to the interior of the 
country the government has constructed a 125mile corridor of 
industrial parks linking guadalajara with colima and manzanillo on 
the pacific 
big plans are in store to install the pacific coastal 
infrastructure that will be needed to handle increased trade with 
basin economies 
a new highway linking the port of manzanillo with points east 
will soon be completed and it is hoped induce foreign firms to 
take advantage of the ports deepwater capacity 
the government plans to make manzanillo a principal shipping 
point for manufactures and other export commodities destined for 
far eastern markets 
struggling with depressed global market prices for oil the 
government has tried to encourage nonoil exports to diversify its 
foreign income sources and enable mexico to continue regular 
servicing of its 104 billion foreign debt 
but oil remains the countrys leading foreign exchange earner 
and the government plans to make it easier and cheaper for far 
eastern nations to obtain it 
the stateowned oil monopoly pemex is upgrading its export 
shipping facilities in the port of lazaro cardenas in michoacan 
state by the end of the year the company will open an oil 
pipeline to the port of salina cruz in southern oaxaca state 
expressly tailored for crude exports to japan south korea and 
other pacific basin nations

opec secretarygeneral subroto arrived in 
tehran monday for crucial talks on cutting the cartels output in a 
bid to stabilize the world oil market and keep prices up 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries is reported to 
be producing about 20 million barrels of oil a day this month some 
35 million barrels a day over its overall production quota 
keeping prices weak 
subroto indonesias former energy minister flew in from kuwait 
on the sixth leg of a tour of oilproducing countries and was 
welcomed by iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh irans 
official islamic republic news agency reported 
subrotos talks will be vital to opec efforts to impose 
production discipline among its 13member nations officials said 
irna monitored in nicosia quoted subroto as urging all opec 
producers to adhere to their output quotas the news agency said 
subroto declined comment on current opec production levels 
subroto was expected to ask the iranians to agree to allow iraq 
their enemy in the persian gulf war a quota equal to irans 236 
million barrels a day 
iraq which began talks with iran recently over ending the 
8yearold war has refused to accept an opec quota of 15 million 
barrels a day about half its current estimated production 
the middle east economic survey a respected oil industry 
newsletter published in nicosia said opecs august output about 
35 million barrels a day over its overall production quota was 
keeping oil prices weak 
opecs official price is 18 a barrel but the weekly noted that 
britains benchmark brent crude was selling at around 15 a barrel 
with gulf crude selling around 150 a barrel below that 
even assuming as may well be the case that demand is running 
at a substantially higher level than projected by most forecasts 
such a production volume is clearly too high for comfort on the 
price front the newsletter said 
the main violator of opecs quota agreement has been the united 
arab emirates it has rejected its quota of 948000 barrels a day 
and is producing an estimated 15 million barrels a day 
iraq currently produces an estimated 3 million barrels a day 
that includes 300000 barrels a day provided by saudi arabia and 
kuwait iraqs allies in the gulf war to help sustain its 
warbattered economy 
that earns baghdad iraqs capital around 12 billion a year 
hopes that iraq might agree to a quota were raised last month 
when tehran unconditionally accepted a united nations ceasefire 
call the truce took effect aug20 
but both iran and iraq badly need to boost oil revenues to pay 
for the massive task of reconstruction oil industry sources 
believe they both may be tempted to produce as much as they can get 
away with 
before the war broke out in september 1980 iranian production 
was around 4 million barrels a day and had reached a peak of 6 
million barrels a day during the reign of the late shah mohammed 
reza pahlavi 
baghdad has an estimated 85 billion in debt because of the war 
and badly needs to boost its oil revenues 
iran is in better financial shape with estimated foreign 
reserves of 5 billion still intact and debts of only a few billion 
dollars 
but its oil revenues have slumped in the last few years during a 
fierce iraqi campaign to throttle its oil exports 
tehran earned around 125 billion from oil in 1984 but last 
years revenues were estimated at 9 billion western oil sources 
have said 
irans deputy oil minister kazempour ardebili last week 
indicated that tehran rejects giving iraq production parity under 
opecs quota system 
the iranians have insisted that iraq be forced to accept the 
lower quota arguing that irans 50 million population is three 
times that of iraq 
the kuwaiti news agency monday quoted unidentified oil sources 
as saying that subroto might suggest increasing irans quota to 
around 25 million barrels a day in an effort to woo tehran 
subroto was expected to go on to baghdad iraqs capital 
wednesday

banca commerciale italiana spa said monday it 
was withdrawing its friendly bid for takeover target irving bank 
corp because of a regulatory hurdle erected by the federal reserve 
the italian bank had offered 84 a share for 51 percent of new 
yorkbased irving in a rival bid bank of new york has offered 15 
in cash and 1575 of its own shares for each irving share 
joseph a rice irvings chairman said in a statement he would 
recommend the board immediately undertake an intensive effort to 
replace the bci transaction with another that is superior to the 
current bank of new york bid 
in trading on the new york stock exchange irving jumped 225 a 
share to 6950 
earlier this month the fed said the italian government agency 
that owns about 60 percent of banca commerciale would have to 
supply financial information in connection with the bid some 
banking industry observers questioned whether the agency instituto 
per la ricostruzione industriale would be willing to do so 
banca commerciale said in a statement the ruling placed a new 
and unpredictable impediment to its plan to acquire irving 
because the fed considered iri a company under the bank holding 
company act it would have had to disclose its interest in more 
than 100 us commercial and industrial institutions 
iri also might have been forced to divest some of those holdings 
to comply with us laws that bar cross ownership of banks and 
industrial concerns 
disputing the ruling the italian bank said in a statement as 
a matter of italian law iri is a government instrumentality and 
not a company and therefore it would be inappropriate for it to 
file with the fed 
bci said it notified irving it was terminating its offer 
bci regrets that irving and its shareholders will not be able 
to participate in what both banks considered to be a mutually 
beneficial transaction the statement said 
rice said that while he deeply regrets bcis withdrawal 
irving understood the decision in light of the fed ruling 
a spokesman for the bank of new york said the bank was pleased 
that bci has withdrawn its bid the spokesman indicated bank of 
new york was planning to persue the offer it has on the table 
although irving has rejected each of its bids 
bank of new york and many private banking analysts have 
maintained bank of new yorks hostile offer was superior to that of 
banca commerciale largely because the new york bank already had 
received conditional regulatory approval that approval expires

grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower 
monday on the chicago board of trade following a late partial 
recovery from a steep selloff that occurred earlier in the session 
traders linked the early declines of as much as 24 cents a 
bushel in the soybean market and 7 cents a bushel for corn futures 
to fears that a high number of delivery notices would be posted 
wednesday against the september contracts 
a high number of delivery notices on the first notice day would 
indicate the potential for a large release of stored grains and 
soybeans onto the open market 
slack export demand and private crop inspections in the midwest 
during the rainy weekend contributed to the selling pressure said 
jerry zusel manager of cbot floor operations for balfour maclaine 
corp 
i think a lot of people were surprised that to see that the 
soybean crop was a little bigger than they thought he said 
prices eventually recovered due to endofthemonth book 
squaring said victor lespinasse a trader with the investment firm 
dean witter reynolds inc 
at the close wheat was 2 cents lower to 1 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in september at 388 a bushel corn was 
1 cents to 6 cents lower with september at 274 a bushel oats 
were 4 cents to 5 cents lower with september at 249 a bushel 
soybeans were 6 cents lower to 1 cent higher with september at 
826 a bushel

another 1042 whitecollar jobs were 
eliminated monday at pratt amp whitney as the giant jetengine 
contractor completed moves designed to make it a more solid 
competitor for commercial and military contracts 
pratt amp whitney a division of united technologies inc said 
the latest job cuts bring to 2650 the number eliminated through 
layoffs attrition and termination of personnel contracts 
the costcutting measures are expected to save the company a 
total of 300 million a year over the next three years and are 
intended to put pratt amp whitney in a better position to compete for 
commercial and military contracts with general electric co and 
rolls royce plc 
pratt amp whitney was once the countrys leading engine maker but 
has slipped to no 2 behind ge in recent years 
david franus of forecast international inc a newtownbased 
market analysis firm for the aerospace industry said the move 
shows pratt amp whitney is getting more physically fit 
this is going to make both companies pampw and ge engines 
more competitively priced with each other and could conceivably 
result in lower prices to the us taxpayer franus said it 
may keep cost escalation down to a bare minimum 
curtis linke pratt amp whitneys vice president for 
communications said in the latest round of job cuts 526 employees 
were being terminated effective monday 231 would be let go by the 
end of 1989 and another 285 were to be eliminated through attrition 
the savings to the company of the elimination of those 1042 
jobs will be an estimated 95 million linke said at a news 
conference 
last month pratt amp whitney announced it was trimming more than 
1000 whitecollar jobs from its commercial engines division and 
earlier this month it announced the elimination of 599 jobs from 
its government operations division 
pratt amp whitneys total us employment was about 37000 before 
the job reductions and will be about 34500 by the end of 1989 
linke said five years ago the company employed about 42000 
workers 
pratt amp whitney used retirement and severance incentives last 
year to reduce its whitecollar workforce by about 2000 
once the worlds dominant jet engine builder pampw saw its share 
of the commercial market drop from 100 percent in 1974 to about 40 
percent in 1987 similar declines occurred in pratt amp whitneys 
military business 
general electrics share of the commercial market grew during 
the same period from nothing to 45 percent to 50 percent 
pratt amp whitney said it is rebounding however with orders this 
year running double the rate of last year 
linke said general electric now has about 40 percent of the 
overall jetengine market and rolls royce about 20 percent

commercial credit group incs takeover of 
primerica corp marks a possible renaissance for smith barney 
harris upham amp co the stodgy brokerage that primerica bought last 
year in what emerged as a costly mistake 
despite the vaunted television advertisements in which actor leo 
mckern intones that smith barney brokers make money the old 
fashioned way they earn it the firm became a big drag on 
primerica primarily because of the stock market crash and a slump 
in the municipal bond underwriting business 
i think the old venerable will be rejuvenated said perrin 
long a brokerage industry expert at lipper analytical securities 
reacting to the news announced monday i think youll find new 
batteries put into the old car high octane gasoline put into the 
tank 
under terms of the takeover agreement commercial credit will 
buy primerica a financial services and retailing concern formerly 
known as american can co for cash and stock valued at 165 
billion the combined firm is expected to retain the primerica name 
for smith barneys 6800 employees and 105 offices worldwide 
the prospect of a financially committed parent means the end of 
uncertainty caused by speculation that primerica chairman gerald 
tsai jr had been seeking a buyer for the 115yearold brokerage he 
bought only 15 months ago for 750 million 
commercial credit a baltimorebased consumer finance concern 
is run by sanford i weill wellknown on wall street for his role 
in founding what is now shearson lehman hutton inc one of the 
biggest investment conglomerates in the country weill also appears 
determined to make commercial credit a powerful force in 
securities investment banking and other financial services 
i think there is a really excellent opportunity for smith 
barney to grow and prosper even in difficult economic 
environments weill told the associated press in a joint 
interview with tsai 
i think the exciting thing about putting the two companies 
together is were really in a way following the smith barney 
advertisements were doing the merger in an oldfashioned way 
tsai who once envisioned building primerica into a 
financialservice supermarket with the help of the smith barney 
acquisition appeared ready and willing to relinquish daytoday 
control to weill though tsai will remain a powerful force in the 
background as chairman of the executive committee 
sandy in my book is the best man to run the brokerage business 
and hes going to play an extremely important part in the future of 
smith barney tsai said 
he also denied his purchase of smith barney had been a blunder 
saying i think if you look at all the newspaper clippings from 
last year after we announced the acquisition everyone says we 
bought a very good company 
at that time tsai was credited with engineering a brilliant 
move by acquiring one of the bestknown wall street firms during a 
roaring bull market that showed no sign of fatigue 
the smith barney addition brought him a household name a 
wellplaced retail brokerage network and a significant force in the 
municipal bond underwriting business 
tsai later revealed that a halfdozen other major wall street 
ceos asked him how he got smith barney so cheaply and he replied 
i said i thought i paid a fair price 
for smith barney which like other securities firms has been 
forced to sacrifice independence to ensure their future growth the 
acquisition by primerica was a way to gain the extra capital needed 
to compete in the brutally competitive securities business 
in retrospect the move appeared disastrously ill timed 
analysts have said a few months later the stock market crashed and 
smith barney lost heavily compelling primerica to cut the firms 
book value by about 43 million 
since then the stock markets postcrash weakness has severely 
hurt the commissions of smith barneys network of more than 2200 
account executives 
aggravating the firms performance was a coincident slump in 
municipal bond underwriting and an erosion in smith barneys share 
of what was left the decline forced the firm to fire five top 
publicfinance officials earlier this month in an effort to reduct 
costs and underwriting losses
