owner john salyers 
but salyers was unable to bring judy to the trophy stand to 
share in the award ceremony during her flight judy swept over the

that salyers was unable to find her 
i lose one or two every year that way said salyers who has 
entered chickens in the meet for nine years two years ago i had 
the longest flier here and i never did find that chicken

federal revenuers have taken the 
moonshine out of the new straitsville moonshine festival 
the new straitsville betterment association had a temporary 
permit from the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms to 
make moonshine whiskey for the last seven festivals but that has 
been lifted 
the bureau says they cant legally give us a permit to make 
moonshine when theyre trying to stop it said kenny burgess jr 
secretary of the association 
the 19th annual festival runs wednesday through monday in new 
straitsville a southcentral ohio community which for years called 
itself the moonshine capital of the world 
of the 47 stills smashed by federal revenuers in the 1930s in 
perry county 32 were in or around new straitsville burgess said 
festival organizer betty st clair said she needed permission

corn sugar yeast and water that is run through the still

legendary mgm film was sold for 20000 at a hollywood auction at 
the ebell theater 
other remnants of hollywoods heyday auctioned saturday included 
a jacket worn by elvis presley and tap shoes worn by fred astaire 
said barry vilkin of camden house auctioneers inc 
some people buy from the heart when moneys no object 
vilkin said maybe thats another explanation why these things 
sell for as much as they do 
the 1938 edition of margaret mitchells southern romance novel 
belonged to actor fred crane who played brent tarlton one of the 
twins vying for scarlett oharas affection in the movies opening 
sequence

clark gable in gone with the wind sold for 3800 nearly 
double its estimated value a civil war coat worn by gable went for 
6000

southern california where the industry started these things 
are thrown away its amazing the stories ive heard 
one guy told me my basement got flooded thats where i had 
all the stuff stored im hoping to flush out the treasures that

when tennesseebased whittle communications 
started beaming a news program with commercials into six high 
schools last winter educators were outraged 
this spring when ted turner and the discovery channel each 
promised schools commercialfree cable news and documentary 
programming many of those same people applauded 
those reactions left the impression that the presence or absence 
of snickers or blue jeans ads was the only concern school officials 
have about classroom tv programmming 
but there are other issues 
one is time a schools most precious commodity said ernest 
l boyer president of the carnegie endowment for the advancement 
of teaching 
hardly a week passes that some study doesnt demand that public 
schools raise test scores and teach more math or science or art 
or values or safe sex all of this presumably to be shoehorned 
into the same 180day school year 
the 12minuteaday channel one news show that whittle offers is 
the equivalent of six classroom days a year one of which would be 
commercials alone 
manya ungar president of the national pta and others say that 
because classroom time is so precious educators should be sure 
that tv programs support rather than supplant the curriculum 
if there are ways to provide this technology when where and 
how the teacher feels it best enhances instruction discussion and 
comprehension then it is to be applauded ungar said if it 
doesnt its a detriment 
few educators outright oppose classroom tv nearly twothirds of 
all school districts now have some link to cable programming 
according to a national school boards association survey 
but television has inherent shortcomings as an educational 
technology many still believe especially compared to 
microcomputers 
television is not the preferred technology in most 
instances said scott thomson executive director of the national 
association of secondary school principals it has a cost 
advantage over film 
but microcomputers are far more powerful educationally than 
television because they are individualized and they are interactive 
unfortunately he continued the public thinks we are 
against technology when we say were not that impressed with 
television but in many ways it is outdated research shows it is 
not that effective 
at least some of these problems can be overcome 
kentucky won praise this school year when it financed the 
nations first statewide educational satellite system public tv 
station kets star channels features hardware that allows 
students all over the state to communicate with a televised teacher 
at the touch of a button 
the announcement last week of assignment discovery to 
debut sept 18 followed turners announcement that his cable news 
network will begin running a 15minute current events show called 
cnn newsroom on aug 14 
the discovery channels proposed classroom tv offering is 
getting favorable early notices 
teachers would be free to tape discovery programs and use them 
when and however they see fit 
discovery channels forte is documentaries and school officials 
said they were excited at the prospect of supplementing lessons 
with clips that would bring history alive in the classroom as no 
textbook could 
in a social studies class i can imagine a teacher saying i 
want you to watch john f kennedy give his ich bein ein berliner 
speech said gary marx a spokesman for the american association 
of school administrators 
the group has blasted whittles commercial channel one but has 
praised discovery channel 
but the debate over classroom commercials masks another 
fundamental issue the decadeslong failure of government and 
educational systems to harness technology to enhance student 
achievement 
in effect commercial broadcasters like whittle are being blamed 
for stepping into that void and wanting to make a profit and the 
school officials pointing accusing fingers at christopher whittle 
for his commercials are the very ones who have largely escaped 
blame for doing little about the technology void that private 
entrepreneurs now seek to fill 
i think its a scandal that were so far into these 
technologies and yet they remain so unconnected with schools 
said boyer education is still standing in the wings lamenting 
its abuses

americans would accept an array of encroachments 
on their lives to help clean up the environment such as a ban on 
aerosol cans and mandatory household recycling a poll has found 
the media generalassociated press survey of 1084 adults found 
broad perceptions that environmental pollution is on the rise and 
that government businesses and average americans are not doing 
enough to combat it 
threequarters of the respondents said laws against pollution in 
the united states are too weak and majorities favored urgent 
government action no matter what the cost to protect the nations 
drinking water 
large majorities also supported strict pollution controls at all 
major oil facilities and at oil and coalburning power plants 
even if those measures would raise the price of oil gasoline and 
electricity 
environmental concerns were heightened by the nearly 11 million 
gallons of oil spilled by the tanker exxon valdez off alaska in 
march 
but the poll conducted by telephone may 513 found concerns 
went beyond the issue of oil tanker safety 
the highest environmental priority was toxic waste disposal in 
which 63 percent supported urgent action by the government 
regardless of the expense next was the related issue of the 
pollution of drinking water with 52 percent favoring urgent 
action cost aside 
on the issue of household waste 20 percent said their 
communities now require them to separate and recycle glass cans 
and paper refuse of the rest an overwhelming 87 percent said they 
would support such a requirement 
respondents also favored new steps against air pollution 
seventyfive percent backed a ban on household aerosol products 60 
percent supported a ban on charcoal lighter fluid and 58 percent 
favored a ban on nonradial tires which release more rubber into 
the air than do radials 
those proposals are among the steps suggested for southern 
california by a regional air quality board in march other measures 
in that plan won less support nationally respondents were split on 
parking restrictions in cities to discourage driving and 59 
percent opposed banning gasolinefueled garden appliances 
still 72 percent supported strict pollution controls on oiland 
coalburning power plants even if that would raise the price of 
power smokestack controls are another feature of the southern 
california plan 
in an issue related to the exxon valdez disaster 81 percent 
said new safety rules and emergency cleanup teams should be in 
place at all major oil facilities even if that raised the price of 
oil and gasoline 
responses were less certain on whether the federal government 
should issue new drilling permits fortyfive percent opposed new 
drilling off the coasts of california and florida while about 35 
percent favored new drilling there and 20 percent were unsure 
opposition was greater to oil drilling in the arctic national 
wildlife refuge in alaska which also is being considered sixty 
percent were opposed and only about a quarter were in favor with 
the rest unsure 
overall 72 percent said pollution appears to have increased 
during the past decade and in a measure of its personal impact 
nearly a quarter said they stayed away from the beach last year 
because of beach pollution 
concerns about the environment crossed ideological and political 
lines residents of the nations most densely populated areas were 
the most apt to see antipollution efforts as inadequate and to 
favor new steps 
respondents indicated there was plenty of blame to go around for 
the nations pollution problems fortytwo percent said businesses 
are doing a poor job of keeping the environment clean and 36 
percent said only fair 
similarly 83 percent rated the federal governments 
environmental record as only fair or poor as opposed to good or 
excellent 71 percent gave a negative rating to their state and 
local governments environmental records and 79 percent said most 
americans are doing only a fair or poor job of keeping the 
environment clean 
the poll which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points 
was conducted by the ap and media general inc a communications 
company based in richmond va that publishes the richmond 
timesdispatch the richmond news leader the tampa fla tribune 
and the winstonsalem nc journal and operates tv stations wxfl

three months after the last soviet 
soldiers left the government is showing increasing confidence it 
can ultimately force moslem guerrillas and their supporters 
especially the united states to talk peace 
after initial anxiety following the red armys withdrawal and 
the guerrillas jalalabad offensive president najibs government 
is displaying a new optimism in its ability to stand alone against 
the mujahedeen guerrillas 
western countries had predicted the mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors would overwhelm the afghan armed forces within weeks or 
at least a few months of the soviets departure on feb 15 
although these predictions have not come true the united states 
has rebuffed proposals by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev for 
a mutual cutoff of weapons and steppedup efforts for a ceasefire 
they say we should give the mujahedeen more time but they 
have had time and they have nothing to show they have no power 
they can only fire rockets foreign minister abdul wakil said 
he said president bush should accept that the guerrillas will 
not bring down the sovietbacked government and that a negotiated 
peace is the only policy consistent with the principles espoused by 
the united states 
the guerrilla attack on jalalabad which kabul claims was 
orchestrated by neighboring pakistans top military and civilian 
officials was based on the assumption that afghanistans 
fifthlargest city would fall quickly clearing the way for a push 
on kabul 
but government forces defending jalalabad have proved their 
morale was not sapped by the soviet withdrawal and the mujahedeen 
have not yet shown themselves capable of transforming from 
hitandrun fighters to a cohesive force able to mount a 
conventional assault on a heavily defended city 
the guerrillas failure to capture jalalabad and other major 
cities appears to have strengthened feelings among government 
troops that the war has become a doordie affair 
as long as the russians were here there was confusion among 
the people about what we were fighting for a 30yearold soldier 
in jalalabad said recently now we know we are fighting as 
afghans and the fighting is for our future 
after failing for nine years to win the war with 115000 
soldiers and a mighty modern arsenal the kremlin now professes a 
desire to play peacemaker it has called for a broadbased 
government in which najibs sovietstyle party would play a role 
but not the only role 
yuli vorontsov the soviet ambassador predicted the military 
stalemate and increasing diplomatic pressure will oblige the united 
states to begin talks on ending the bloodshed 
more than 13 million afghans nearly onetenth of the 
countrys prewar population of 15 million have been killed 
another 5 million have fled across the borders to pakistan and iran 
by the end of summer i think there will be a change of mind 
a change of this policy of give war a chance vorontsov said 
many foreign diplomats in kabul including from nations friendly 
to the west also said they believe the united states will feel 
increasing pressure for a settlement 
china already has promised moscow it will halt arms supplies to 
the guerrillas when current contracts expire chinese and soviet 
diplomats said on condition of anonymity 
and on sunday najib offered a dozen guerrilla field commanders 
full autonomy in their regions if they stop fighting the government 
and help end the 11yearold civil war 
iran anxious to repatriate its 2 million afghan refugees also 
appears to be shifting toward a negotiated peace that leaves only 
the united states pakistan and saudi arabia the guerrillas 
other major backers committed to ending the fighting 
a diplomat from a noncommunist prowestern nation said 
najib has proven he is tough organized and that he wont run 
the longer the western countries try to ignore him the stronger 
theyre going to allow him to become in two or three months time 
he could well be a hero 
a common preference for a settlement seems to rest with an 
illdefined compromise a government that is neither as ruthless as 
the ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan has been since 
it seized power in 1978 nor as committed to islamic fundamentalism 
as some of the most powerful guerrilla groups are 
events of the last decade have provided little nourishment for 
middleoftheroad politics and seem to leave the task of finding a 
compromise up to those on the outside such as the united nations 
or the superpowers

gumshoes trying to crack the case of why abcs 
moonlighting was canceled have at least two suspects bruce 
willis and cybill shepherd 
the shows stars apparently spent much of their time arguing 
with each other and with the series creator glenn gordon caron 
said an abc official quoted in this weeks people magazine 
they were working in a pressure cooker said the official 
who was not identified 
the tongueincheek detective series had its final episode 
earlier this month after four seasons spiced with snappy repartee 
and doubleentendres it made a star of willis and was a comeback 
vehicle for shepherd 
but the shows real turnaround came with shepherds 1987 
pregnancy which plagued her with sickness and left her unable to 
work the shows long hours 
and when willis lost interest one writer told people the show 
was doomed 
cybill may have been erratic but bruce had always been the 
motor that drove the show once bruce stopped caring it became 
very hard on everyone said the writer who also was not

prince philip says the dream of rebuilding 
londons globe theater began as a slightly crazy notion but 
will become a tribute to william shakespeare 
the effort to raise 33 million to recreate a replica of the 
theater where the bard made his debut as an actor is a grand 
scheme the duke of edinburgh told reporters sunday 
the prince was the guest of honor at a dinner where actor sam 
wanamaker and representatives of the shakespeare globe centre 
finished a us fundraising tour wanamaker initiated the 
restoration project 
the prince said wanamaker persevered over those who wanted to 
build houses on the site adding that the idea was initially 
considered a slightly crazy notion 
the globe replica is scheduled to open in 1992 on shakespeares 
birthday april 23 the original globe was built in 1599 it was 
destroyed in 1613 when a cannon fired during a performance of 
henry viii set fire to the thatched roof it was rebuilt in 
1614 but torn down in 1644 for tenement housing today the site is 
an empty lot

the platform of the washington subway station 
is crowded and former sen william proxmire is striding so rapidly 
through the cavernous space that he could almost be said to be 
running 
flashing lights and a faraway rumble signal the approach of a 
train 
proxmire is out of position he moves from a rapid walk to a 
dash darting inside a car just before the doors close with an 
automated whoosh 
its not an isolated event its a routine 
i pace up and down carrying a heavy brief case the 
73yearold wisconsin democrat says i do a sprint right at the 
very end 
proxmire was once the countrys most celebrated longdistance 
amateur runner 
for decades he ran flat out i never jogged the five 
miles between his home in cleveland park in northwest washington 
and his senate office on capitol hill 
i cant do that anymore he says ive got a bum knee 
so he exercises rides his stationary bike and strides the 
length of lengthy subway platforms 
one great heart specialist says the secret is that youve got 
to keep moving got to keep moving the former senator says 
on this particular day like most days proxmire goes to work in 
a tiny cubicle attached to the robert m lafollette sr 
congressional reading room in the library of congress 
the room has a special significance for him 
he held lafollettes seat in the united states senate for 31 
years ever since he won a special election to replace the late 
sen joseph r mccarthy in 1957 
the cubicle is equipped with a chair bookshelves a telephone 
and typewriter it is not equipped with a view a computer terminal 
is expected soon 
not much room not much equipment for a man who until last 
december commanded a large office suite in the dirksen senate 
office building and a personal and committee staff of dozens 
when youre in the congress you really get support proxmire 
says i loved the senate but i dont very much miss it 
what i do miss is the clerical staff the secretarial support 
the schedulers the researchers 
in retirement proxmire is pretty much of a oneman band with 
an occasional boost now and then from former staff members he does 
his own typing 
and he is gingerly returning to what he calls my first love 
journalism 
an early job in 1949 was as a reporter with the capitol times 
in madison wis he was fired after a series of runins with 
management 
but now hes back 
proxmire is launching a twiceaweek newspaper column under the 
auspices of united features syndicate he says that one of the 40 
or 50 subscribers signed up so far is the capitol times 
proxmire launched his column last week with a news conference at 
the national press club in which he resurrected his golden fleece 
award perhaps the most successful political public relations 
device of its era 
the fleece will be a monthly feature of the proxmire column 
carrying on a tradition that beginning in march 1975 continued 
for 165 consecutive months with citations for what proxmire 
considered examples of conspicuous government waste and an 
occasional award of merit for a positive action that saved money or 
spent it well 
just because im out of the senate doesnt mean we have to 
abandon a device that does something to cut down spending in this 
time of fearful budget deficits proxmire says 
proxmire also is planning a book 
subject debt government debt business debt household debt 
proxmire former chairman of the senate banking committee has 
been predicting a sharp recession for years i think when the 
recession comes its likely to be a real killer a depression and 
that is because our debt is so enormous 
he has been working up to the book by using debt as the theme of 
dozens of speeches around the country 
at the press club news conference proxmire was asked if he as 
a former banking committee chairman had ever considered giving 
himself a golden fleece for failing to spot and stop the pattern of 
abuses that grew into the multibilliondollar savings and loan 
scandal 
there were so many mistakes by so many people that youd have 
to have a barrel of fleeces including one for the chairman of the 
senate banking committee he replied 
ill let other people give me a fleece rather than commit 
suicide proxmire said

house speaker jim wrights televised defense 
against ethics charges this week will be that the rules were 
changed in midstream but even his own lawyers give him less than 
an even chance of winning quick dismissal of the case 
wrights lawyers will argue that the two most serious sets of 
charges brought against their client by the house ethics committee 
should be dismissed because the panel reacting to a new moral 
climate has stretched the rules beyond their original intent 
we are hoping for a clear interpretation that the rules 
havent changed on us wright said 
but wrights lawyers concede such motions are routinely denied 
and give the speaker less than even chance of winning a preemptive 
dismissal of the charges 
william c oldaker one of wrights lawyers said last week that 
in a bestcase scenario the odds of succeeding with such a motion 
would be 5050 in this case he conceded that the odds could be 
something less than that 
and a growing number of house democrats are saying that while 
the ethics process is important it may ultimately prove irrelevant 
to the speakers political fortunes 
it would be nice if he could be in a position to defend his 
case on the merits before he has to face the question of what the 
political consequences are said rep david obey dwis who has 
argued that the rules are on wrights side 
stephen d susman a hardnosed trial lawyer brought in this 
month to bolster the defense team is expected to argue that the 
committee misapplied the rules in two ways 
in charging wright with evading limits on outside earned income 
through bulk sales of his book reflections of a public man 
the panel ignored a rule specifically exempting book royalties from 
the limit 
house rules place a cap on money earned from speaking fees at 30 
percent of congressional salary the ethics panel said that in 
seven instances wright sold bulk quantities of books to groups he 
had spoken to and that the sales were really disguised speaking 
fees which he otherwise wouldnt have been able to accept 
no rule of the house no advisory opinion no prior cases and 
not one shred of legislative history supports the outside 
special counsels revisionist approach to the copyright royalty 
exemption the lawyers argue in a statement 
charges that wright improperly accepted 145000 in improper 
gifts from george mallick a fort worth real estate developer and 
business partner of the speaker are based on a finding that 
mallick had a direct interest in legislation before congress 
over a period of nearly 10 years mallick gave wright and his 
wife betty use of a car and a condominium in fort worth and from 
1979 through 1984 paid mrs wright an 18000ayear salary the 
committee found reason to believe those amounted to gifts and that 
mallick had a stake in legislation because of his many investments 
house rules bar acceptance of more than 100 in gifts annually from 
any such person 
an ethics committee advisory opinion defines the direct interest 
standard as a distinct or special interest in influencing or 
affecting the federal legislative process which sets the individual 
or organization apart from the general public 
chicago lawyer richard j phelan the ethics committees special 
outside counsel in the case will defend the panels rules 
interpretation at the hearing tuesday 
the dismissal motion essentially asks the ethics committee to 
abandon rules interpretations it earlier had decided to accept 
committee chairman julian dixon dcalif last week characterized 
the panels original decision as very well founded 
wrights defense team is not challenging at least for the 
moment charges that he failed to report the mallick benefits as 
gifts on his annual financial disclosure forms a relatively minor 
concern 
following the hearing expected to take about six hours the 
committee will meet later in the week to rule on the dismissal 
motion any remaining charges then would become the subject of a 
disciplinary hearing 
wright and his advisers hoping to avoid prolonging what has 
become a daily barrage of negative news stories and new 
allegations are expected to ask that the committee begin the 
triallike hearing immediately dixon has said the hearing would 
probably take more than a week the panel then would rule on 
whether the charges have been proved with clear and convincing 
evidence and could recommend sanctions to the full house 
the house is free to accept reject or modify the 
recommendation but many lawmakers say it is most likely that the 
chamber would simply accept whatever the ethics panel suggests

a new agriculture department analysis shows 
that farmers and ranchers with cowcalf operations the foundation 
herds that form the bedrock of the nations beef business will 
probably make money again this year 
but the detailed figures by the departments economic research 
service include some sour notes regarding capital improvements that 
could affect the longterm financial health of the cattle industry 
the analysis also includes some mixed outlook figures for hog 
producers who saw market prices drop sharply last year even sheep 
producers are feeling a pinch 
if only cash flow is considered the cowcalf operators are in 
pretty good shape economists hosein shakpouri and terry crawford 
said in their report but when costs of capital replacement are 
included the situation is much less encouraging 
the report compares estimated 1988 production costs and net 
returns with those projected for 1989 
last years drought severely affected all livestock 
producers the report said spending on feed jumped 28 percent from 
1987 while gross cash receipts from livestock sales increased only 
3 percent 
on the average the gross value of production of one beef 
cow totaled 34818 in 1988 that was up from 31370 in 1987 the 
projection for 1989 is 34606 per cow 
the values were construed by including allowances for calves and 
culled cows and converting them to a onecow figure 
cash expenses ranging from feed to taxes insurance and 
interest also were prorated on a onecow basis those added up to 
29677 last year up from 25584 in 1987 the projection for 1989 
is 30626 per cow 
thus after deducting cash expenses from gross values the 
cowcalf operator this year may have an average cash return of 
3980 per cow down from 5046 in 1988 and 5786 in 1987 the 
report showed 
but if an allowance for capital replacement of buildings 
equipment and other facilities is included the tidy percow net 
profit disappears in this case the report said the operator 
could lose an average of 4179 per cow in 1989 compared with 
losses of 2669 in 1988 and 1772 in 1987 
cash returns before and after a charge for the replacement 
capital are key indicators of producer supply response the 
report said a positive cash return is an incentive for producers 
to continue or even expand their operation a negative cash return 
is often regarded as a signal to discontinue production 
however the report added the figures are averages and there 
are producers who fare better or worse some individual operators 
may expand when most do not also they can make substitutions in 
production items in different proportions than allowed in the 
analysis 
the cash return or residual reflects the cash flow available 
for paying family living expenses repaying debts and replacing 
machinery equipment and buildings 
in the shortterm producers may defer machinery and equipment 
purchases or repairs if the farm is producing little income or is 
in an unfavorable tax position the report said but over the 
long run operators must replace and maintain the buildings and 
equipment typically used in the operation 
the report said the projected decline in net returns to cowcalf 
operators this year is due primarily to higher wintering 
expenses higher feed costs and a small increase in the market 
price of fed beef would lower the price cattle feeders can pay 
for feeder cattle in 1989 which will help depress cowcalf 
returns 
looking at the hog situation the report said farrowtofinish 
operators who account for about 80 percent of the slaughter hogs 
produced saw 1988 gross value of production drop to an equivalent 
of 4287 per 100 pounds from 5130 per hundredweight in 1987 
this years value was projected at 4123 
cash expenses meanwhile jumped to 4164 per hundredweight in 
1988 from 3407 in 1987 this year cash expenses were projected at 
an equivalent of 4444 per hundredweight 
consequently last years cash return to farrowtofinish 
operators averaged 123 per hundredweight down from 1723 in 
1987 this year hog farmers are expected to lose 321 per 
hundredweight 
after allowing for capital replacement hog producers lost 589 
per hundredweight in 1988 compared with a profit of 1034 in 
1987 this years loss was shown at 1064 per hundredweight 
sheep production has consistently been one of the most 
profitable livestock enterprises in the past 18 years the report 
said nevertheless us sheep producers experienced a sharp 
decline in their cash returns in 1988 as sheep production 
increased higher feed costs as well as lower lamb prices eroded 
their financial positions 
the average value of sheep production 1988 was reported at 
6556 per ewe in 1988 down from 7305 in 1987 the value for 
1989 was projected at 6398 per ewe cash expenses were 4638 in 
1988 4466 in 1987 and projected at 4767 in 1989 
as a result net cash returns averaged 1918 per ewe in 1988 
compared with 2839 in 1987 and a 1989 return projected at 1631 
with allowances for capital replacement sheep producers were 
shown at a profit of 1112 per ewe in 1988 and 2060 in 1987 the 
projection for 1989 was 790 per ewe

last september jennifer cohen thought 
france was a blob on the eastern tip of the soviet union last 
week the 12yearold could draw a map of the world from memory 
for more than a decade shady hill school teacher david j smith 
has been sending seventhgrade geography whizzes into a society 
where according to a recent gallup poll one in seven americans 
cant find the united states on a map of the world 
you cant get anywhere underestimating the ability of a 
seventhgrader smith said they can accomplish enormous things 
if you set them a task they can break into manageable pieces 
without consulting an atlas this springs crop of pupils has 
already outlined the continents with startling accuracy 
on jennifers map the sinuous curve of the americas the 
scandinavian hump even the six states of australia were correctly 
proportioned on a mercator grid now she is filling in countries 
cities mountains and rivers even adding the names of soviet 
republics 
at 12 jennifer is trying to remember facts that would stump 
most college pupils whether wellington is the capital of new 
zealand and whether to put it on the islands north or south 
the hardest part is greenland and all the little islands on 
the top of canada she said 
at the beginning of the school year smith hands his pupils a 
blank sheet of paper and asks them to draw everything they know 
about the world 
most of the sheets are returned with little more than vague 
circles and squiggles 
the problem isnt limited to younger students a 1988 gallup 
poll commissioned by the national geographic society found 
americans ages 18 to 24 knew less about the world than their 
counterparts in nine countries 
smith keeps those embarrassing first efforts so pupils can 
proudly compare them to their memory maps at years end 
he teaches geography at the approximate rate of a continent 
every two weeks 
at the end of the year students spend six weeks making practice 
maps and three weeks creating their memory maps some children who 
rarely speak in class produce maps so beautiful that their parents 
frame them smith said 
though shady hill is a private school smith thinks his teaching 
method would work elsewhere if educators allot the subject enough 
time 
its important that they know about americas place in the 
world he said but whats really important is that its a 
ninemonth project in an age of instant gratification they leave 
here with a sense of what theyre capable of

speaker jim wright dtexas was charged april 
17 by the house ethics committee with 69 instances of violating 
house rules and new allegations have since arisen in news reports 
wright denies having committed ethical violations here is a 
rundown on the charges 
book sales the ethics committee charged that on seven 
occasions wright sold bulk quantities of his book reflections 
of a public man to groups to which he had given speeches the 
panel contends that wright improperly disguised speaking fees 
which are limited under the rules as royalties which are not 
legislative interest the committee charged that fort worth 
real estate developer george mallick by virtue of his extensive 
financial holdings had a direct interest in legislation before 
congress that would make benefits wright and his wife received 
from mallick from 1979 to 1988 totaling 145000 improper under 
the rules 
gift reporting the committee charged that the benefits 
including mrs wrights 18000ayear salary from 1979 through 
1984 and use of a 1979 cadillac and a fort worth condominium were 
not reported as gifts on wrights annual financial disclosure form 
as required 
sabine lake ethics investigators are still looking into 
whether wright received improper proceeds from a 1988 investment in 
a texas gas drilling venture known as the sabine lake prospect 
the venture yielded wrights blind trust a quick 170000 profit 
even though the well has so far proven dry doug jaffe a san 
antonio businessman who arranged the investment is seeking to sell 
training aircraft to the pentagon 
jewell enterprises wright borrowed 100000 to invest in a 
nowdefunct business that bought and sold nursing homes although 
he ultimately lost his money at one point he reportedly received 
23000 in dividends unavailable to other investors and got help 
paying the interest on his loan the ethics panel still is 
examining the transactions 
pacific institute former employees of a seattle wash firm 
that sells motivational programs say wrights wife betty did little 
or no work for the 36000 salary she received from 1985 to 1988 
her boss at the time insists she performed satisfactorily wright 
used the congressional record to print a glowing endorsement of a 
videotape his wife had helped produce for the firm the ethics 
panel is believed to be taking a look at these events as well

president bush says the dispute over 
shortrange nuclear weapons that has split nato could be resolved 
before next weeks 40thanniversary meeting of the alliance 
i think great progress has been made in efforts to reconcile 
uswest german differences over possible negotiations on the 
missiles bush said sunday during a joint news conference in boston 
with french president francois mitterrand 
i think that we could well have this resolved before the 
summit bush said 
still the dispute remains a vexing question and there are 
strongwilled people from strong countries and they each have an 
opinion he said after he and mitterrand gave backtoback 
commencement speeches at boston university 
one way to guarantee there will not be progress is to lock 
each other in in public statements bush added 
the united states after first opposing bonns suggestions for 
early ussoviet talks on reducing shortrange missiles in europe 
has sent a counterproposal to west germany agreeing to accept such 
talks in principle in the future according to secretary of state 
james a baker iii 
however the united states first wants to see the soviets reduce 
their conventionalforce edge a position bush reiterated sunday 
in his commencement address bush said that though hope is now 
running high for a more peaceful continent the history of this 
century teaches americans and europeans to remain prepared 
mitterrand who has generally agreed with the us position 
said his role was not that of a mediator between the united states 
and germany on the issue 
obviously id be happy if views can be reconciled and i 
believe i think that they can be reconciled he said 
mitterrand in response to a question refused to agree with a 
statement last week by white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
that soviet leader mikhail gorbachev was acting in a drugstore 
cowboy fashion in making a succession of armscontrol proposals 
i think that one must be wary of caricatures mr gorbachev is 
worth very much more than that mitterrand said 
in his own commencement speech delivered in french and 
translated in segments to an estimated audience of 31000 in boston 
universitys nickerson field mitterrand praised gorbachev along 
with bush and former president ronald reagan for their combined 
efforts to reduce the worlds arsenal of nuclear weapons 
mitterrand also called for all nations to join in framing an 
emergency plan to save the environment the death of the 
environment is our death he said 
bush at the news conference said i heard his clarion call 
for cooperative action on the environment and i salute him for 
that 
bush had entertained mitterrand at his oceanside vacation home 
in kennebunkport maine for the weekend 
after the boston university appearances bush bade the french 
leader farewell at a military departure ceremony at bostons logan 
airport where mitterrand boarded his air france supersonic 
concorde for the return trip to paris 
bush then traveled to greenwich conn where he visited his 
ailing 87yearold mother dorothy walker bush for about an hour 
and a half mrs bush is recovering from a mild stroke bush 
returned to washington sunday evening 
in boston bush met with his vanquished 1988 democratic 
presidential challenger massachusetts gov michael dukakis the 
two shook hands at a precommencement reception 
dukakis applauded vigorously by the hometown audience when he 
was introduced later in the stadium also shared the dais with bush 
during the commencement ceremonies 
in his commencement speech bush was sharply critical of recent 
comments by soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze that the 
soviets commitment to destroy ss23 missiles under the 1987 
treaty to eliminate mediumrange nuclear weapons may be 
reversible 
the soviets must surely know the results of failure to comply 
with this solemn agreement perhaps their purpose was to divide the 
west on other issues regardless it is clear that soviet new 
thinking has not yet totally overcome the old bush said 
shevardnadze made the comments in response to us proposals to 
upgrade and extend the range of the americanbuilt lance 
shortrange missiles which are not covered by the treaty on 
intermediaterange missiles 
bush also said the united states has consulted with the 
government of british prime minister margaret thatcher to come up 
with an agreement with west germany that would avoid a clash over 
the shortrange missile flap at the may 2930 nato meeting 
britain like the united states has strongly opposed eastwest 
talks on cutting natos nuclear battlefield weapons at this time

a roman catholic cardinal said an aids education 
program in the boston public schools will increase students risk 
of getting the disease and has urged parents not to allow their 
children to participate 
in a letter read at weekend masses in boston parishes cardinal 
bernard f law said the lessons planned for students in seventh 
throught 12th grades over the next six weeks could place our 
children in danger both moral and physical 
the curriculum presents various issues of sexual behavior in a 
valueless amoral context law wrote it admits a 
permissiveness in sexual behavior which is not acceptable to a 
great many citizens of the city is certainly unacceptable for 
catholics and which increases the childrens risk of gettting 
aids 
the schools plan to offer two 45minute lessons stressing 
abstinence and shunning intravenous drug use as the best way to 
prevent aids instructors will tell students who are sexually 
active to use condoms parents who object may exempt their children 
from the classes 
law warned that students as young as 13 will be given 
explicit instructions in the use of condoms sexual abstinence 
cannot be taught if at the same time detailed directions on how to 
use condoms are presented as an alternative 
he said the archdiocese will offer its own valuecentered 
aids education program this summer 
some school leaders disagreed with laws evaluation of the 
program 
it is fine for him to take moral positions but young people 
have not abstained from sexual activity said school 
superintendent laval s wilson thats the reality we deal with 
in the public schools 
they are not all catholic but protestants jewish 
buddhists said jean mcguire a school committee member they 
have a right to know how to protect themselves from any sexually 
transmitted disease 
a protestant leader the rev warren m brown pastor of the 
columbus avenue ame zion church and chairman of the black 
ecumenical commission said that like cardinal law he was 
concerned that parts of the curriculum send a mixed message to 
young people 
but the cardinals position fails to take into consideration 
the fact that the problem already exists he added 
two years ago a plan for pilot school health clinics that could 
have prescribed birth control devices was derailed by political and 
religious foes

its springtime on marthas vineyard and 
the locals are girding for whats become an annual influx of 
arrogant offensive pests who walk the streets at night and hang 
out at restaurants 
its not tourists its skunks 
hordes of the black cats with white tails have inhabited the 
island taking up residence under houses rummaging through 
restaurant garbage intimidating vacationers terrorizing pets and 
frankly stinking up the place 
theyre really bold and brassy you can see them on the main 
streets you can see them walking around anywhere said diane 
goodale animal control officer for the vineyard haven section of 
town if youre fishing at night theyll just come right up to 
you 
dead fish along the shore ground nesting birds and plenty of 
woods make the island an ideal habitat for skunks and state 
wildlife officials and animal control officers in the islands six 
towns say their telephones dont stop ringing in the springtime 
when baby skunks are born and the warm weather makes the beasts 
more active 
fin miller was the man many residents hired from 1982 until his 
retirement in 1987 to rid their property of the raccoons skunks 
and feral cats that were giving them headaches 
during that fiveyear period he said he trapped nearly 500 
skunks another trapper was said to have caught about 300 a year 
during the period 
i found theyre partial to devil dogs and twinkies people 
used to call it junk food but i used to call it skunk food 
miller said i could catch a skunk on any place except the 
presbyterian church steeple they havent gotten up there yet 
many islanders swear that at least since colonial times no 
skunks were on the island before the late 1950s how they returned 
to marthas vineyard is a touchy matter involving old allegations 
that have flourished into local lore 
legend has it that the skunk population was revived when 
vineyard haven native craig kingsbury brought two unscented skunks 
one male and one female and set them free to roam with the 
oxen cattle and goats on his farm some 30 years ago 
kingsbury 77 swears its not true 
he blames vacationers for bringing baby skunks and raccoons over 
as pets and abandoning them on the island when the cuddly critters 
got big and nasty the old farmer said he was accused by his 
neighbors because a family of abandoned skunks took up residence on 
his property 
the skunks moved in on my farm and i didnt bother them kill 
them or have a fit over them i just left them alone he said 
and laughed at the typical city vacationers fear of wildlife 
anything bigger than a field mouse puts them in a trauma 
but the rumors persist 
for some reason theres always a dead skunk in front of his 
house if you dont see them you can smell them goodale said 
the 100squaremile island has few predators to control the 
skunk population 
they only have one natural enemy and that has four wheels 
said peter kazlauskas operations manager of the islands trash 
disposal agency 
sandra lucas of the states environmental police said the 
problem is really partskunk and partpeople she said if residents 
could learn to cap their garbage close up basement windows and not 
bother the skunks people could coexist with the mammals 
wildlife workers occasionally are called to come to the aid of a 
skunk found stumbling along with a head trapped in a yogurt 
container or jelly jar but more often they get complaints 
lucas favorite comes from people who call to say their dog was 
sprayed while he was out running around the neighborhood 
they violate the leash law their dog gets sprayed and they 
want me to kill the skunk she said

here are excerpts from the joint news conference 
sunday by president bush and french president francois mitterrand 
bush on china 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we do support freedom of speech freedom of assembly freedom 
of the press and clearly we support democracy i dont want to be 
gratuitous in giving advice but i would encourage restraint i do 
not want to see bloodshed we revere the model of martin luther 
king in this country for his peaceful protest and so i might 
suggest a familiarization with that for the people in china and i 
would urge the government to be as forthcoming as possible in order 
to see more democratization and to see a peaceful resolution of 
this matter 
we have been in touch with our ambassador on this very key 
question i think this perhaps is a time for caution because we 
aspire to see the chinese people have democracy but we do not 
exhort in a way that is going to stir up a military confrontation 
we do not want to have a situation like happened in burma or some 
other place and so as we counsel restraint and as we counsel 
peaceful means of effecting change that is sound advice and i 
think to go beyond that and encourage steps that could lead to 
bloodshed would be inappropriate 
i dont think that it would be appropriate for the president 
of the united states to say to the demonstrators and the students 
in beijing exactly what their course of action should be that is 
for them to determine they know the united states commitment to 
democracy to the commitment to freedom to the aspiration we have 
that all people will live in democratic societies but im not 
about to suggest what i think they ought to do except to spell out 
peaceful and continue to fight for what you believe in stand up 
for what you believe in but beyond that i cannot go 
theres certainly an enormous expression on the part of many 
people students and others for change for movement toward 
democracy i lived there i saw a society totally different than 
the one that exists in china today china has moved in some areas 
towards democracy now the quest is and the appeal from these 
kids is to move further but i am not going to dictate or try 
to say from the united states how this matter should be resolved 
by these students im not going to do it

on resolving the nato dispute over shortrange missiles 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
mitterrand i think that we have now the elements of ideas 
that could form a decision that will be taken just in a weeks 
time and i think that the decision that will be taken will be 
found positive from the point of view of all members of the 
alliance the important thing is that the unity of the the 
general interest of the alliance should prevail and it will 
bush 
i think great progress has been made we are in active 
consultation with the germans and others i think that we could 
well have this resolved before the summit 
there are strongwilled people from strong countries and they 
each have an opinion but my role has been to try behind the 
scenes to be helpful for working this problem out and i should 
salute the president of france as he has tried to be 
extraordinarily helpful in working this problem out

they may have been just yards from two world 
leaders but many graduating seniors were less than awestruck 
during boston universitys 116th commencement 
the presence of president bush and frances president francois 
mitterrand at sundays graduation caused a mixed reaction among the 
roughly 5400 graduates 
we had to throw away the champagne bottles said graduating 
senior dave wheeler 21 who received a degree in political 
science but i guess it is worth the tradeoff if it means having 
the president here 
mary hansel 22 a graduating senior from rochester ny said 
some in her class thought bush and mitterrand would overshadow them 
some of the people fear it takes away from us hansel said 
but mostly it is exciting most people cant believe we are 
here 
but if some students were ambivalent about the extraordinary 
pomp and circumstance surrounding their graduation many of the 
more than 30000 alumni friends and relatives in the packed 
audience were thrilled 
some like saul holtzman 72 a member of the class of 1939 
came from albuquerque nm for the ceremony 
its great really exciting said holtzman sitting with 
other members of the 50th reunion class on nickerson field which 
was festooned with french flags its a lot different from 50 
years ago republican presidential candidate alf landon was our 
speaker then 
adel anbar 23 a graduating senior said his parents traveled 
from the small persian gulf nation of qatar when they heard that 
bush and mitterrand were the featured speakers 
it was a good reason for my parents to come said anbar 
bush and mitterrand and their wives barbara bush and danielle 
mitterrand were welcomed with applause and cheers 
the heartiest and most surprising reception was reserved for 
democratic gov michael s dukakis who has been under siege since 
his failed presidential campaign for the states fiscal crisis 
some of the students wore peace symbols on their gowns and the 
words bush knew on their mortar boards a few held up protest 
signs when bush began his address 
im wearing this because bush knew about the contras but went 
ahead and made oliver north the scapegoat said claire connelly 
22 a graduating senior from south boston its an imperialist 
presidency and bush shouldnt be here 
another group of demonstrators handed out leaflets outside the 
stadium protesting bush administration policies 
but most of the students a number of them holding tiny french 
and us flags said they were pleased with the commencement they 
often interrupted mitterrands speech cheering the french 
presidents exhortations for a better environment when he said 
the earth is our planet let us save it 
wheeler who will be attending law school said most students 
were glad bush attended the graduation 
were all pretty bourgeois he said

up to 40000 people in st louis rallied to demonstrate their 
hope the us supreme court will overturn the 1973 decision that 
legalized abortions and more than 100 antiabortion protesters 
were arrested in cleveland 
in pittsburgh about 4000 people sang and prayed carrying 
balloons and placards during an antiabortion rally in the citys 
market square the protesters paraded through the downtown shopping 
area in a light rain saturday during the 10th annual greater 
pittsburgh march for life 
the st louis demonstrators gathered at kiener plaza on sunday 
without incident and no arrests were made said police lt roy 
miller 
organizers called it the largest antiabortion rally in st 
louis but several police officers at the scene and prochoice 
supporters disagreed with the official crowd estimate they said 
only about 5000 to 10000 demonstrators were on hand 
in cleveland 119 protesters were arrested saturday outside of 
two abortion clinics they were charged with aggravated disorderly 
conduct resisting arrest and criminal trespassing 
edward j heben jr a lawyer representing the protesters said 
his clients planned to plead innocent to all charges today in 
cleveland municipal court 
st louis demonstrators marched several blocks through downtown 
some holding balloons and banners one teenage girl carried a sign 
saying thanks mom 
the showme life rally came several weeks after the us 
supreme court heard arguments in a missouri abortion case that 
could be used to overturn the landmark roe vs wade decision that 
legalized the procedure in 1973 
the court is expected to announce its decision this summer in 
that case webster vs reproductive health services 
the missouri law at issue passed in 1986 declares that human 
life begins at conception it restricts abortion by banning the 
procedure in publicly financed hospitals and by forbidding the use 
of public funds 
loretto wagner of missouri citizens for life said rally 
organizers hoped to impress the supreme court with the number of 
people who attended the st louis event 
during the rally about 85 prochoice supporters stood across 
from kiener plaza one woman carried a giant white coat hanger with 
the messages never again and keep abortion safe and legal 
we just wanted to be a thorn in their side to keep them 
honest said brooke petersen a board member of the missouri 
affiliate of the national abortion rights action league 
the antiabortion rally was sponsored by missouri citizens for 
life along with the archdiocesan prolife committee the christian 
action council and clergy for life

american troops face a greater threat of 
becoming involved in war because of guerrilla insurgencies in such 
places as central america peru or the philippines than from 
tensions with the soviet union a pentagon specialist says 
thats the real threat its the real war william olson 
deputy assistant secretary for defense for lowintensity conflict 
said in a recent interview but its very difficult to go to the 
american public and convince them that a country that has a 
population less than cook county illinois is a threat to national 
security 
olson and others say pentagon strategy for the past 40 years has 
focused on possible confrontation with the soviet union leading in 
turn to an emphasis on massive troop deployments and expensive 
hitech weapons they say the defense departments failure to 
concentrate more on guerrilla wars left the united states 
illprepared to deal with such lowintensity conflicts which olson 
says can pose a threat to our economic interests a threat to 
political values a threat to the survival of our friends and 
allies 
congress noting the importance of the issue in 1986 mandated a 
special office to coordinate lowintensity conflict and special 
operations it called for a new command an added assistant 
secretary of defense and a special board within the national 
security council 
since then legislators have given high marks to the military 
for moving ahead with the special operations command which unites 
the elite units of the army air force and navy at macdill air 
force base in florida but they point to footdragging surrounding 
lowintensity conflict policy 
three problems are most glaring the lack of interest in 
lowintensity conflict which is most pronounced in nondefense 
activities major conceptual shortcomings and the lack of 
interagency coordination four of the senate proponents of the 
legislation said in a jan 25 letter to lt gen brent scowcroft 
president bushs national security director 
unfortunately opposition within the executive branch has 
blocked meaningful implementation of these important reforms the 
letter signed by sens sam nunn dga john warner rva edward 
kennedy dmass and william cohen rmaine said 
rep john kasich rohio of the house committee on armed 
services said institutional opposition at the pentagon delayed 
the appointment of an assistant secretary of defense former 
ambassador charles s whitehouse assumed the office in june 1988 
but already is stepping down due to the change in administrations 
military and legislative sources said the leading candidate is 
james r locher an aide to nunn and that defense secretary dick 
cheney has sent lochers name to president bush for approval 
hes the only man for the job retired army col george 
talbot said of locher of all the possible men who could make the 
cut locher is the one 
talbot was olsons predecessor as pentagon policy specialist for 
lowintensity conflict from may 1987 to october 1987 he said he 
quit because the pentagon didnt want an activist guy and few 
policy makers understand what guerrilla wars involve 
in a very short time we get fed up he said in a telephone 
interview its not what the professional warrior class wants to 
do thats why were no good at it 
army col ed smith in a position paper about lowintensity 
conflict last year said it is total war and described it as 
an armed conflict in a third world country that affects national 
security interests a conflict which has the potential to involve 
us armed combat forces 
smith preferred the term highprobability conflict and 
defined it as our marxistleninist foes exploiting a us 
vulnerability the seams between the department of state 
department of defense and congress created by regulatory missions 
and statutes 
guerrilla wars such as those being fought today in el salvador 
and peru generally involve low levels of combat with weaponry no 
more sophisticated than rifles or mortars by definition socalled 
conventional wars use advanced fighter jets tanks and missiles 
part of the us armed forces program for lowintensity conflict 
has been to train equip and support foreign military forces in 
the case of el salvador 55 american advisers train the salvadoran 
military to combat a leftist guerrilla insurgency 
the whole thrust of our lowintensity conflict policy is to 
avoid the commitment of us forces olson said there is no 
consensus in us involvement in these small wars 
he said the military traditionally has cited tensions with the 
soviet union to justify huge military outlays and sophisticated 
weaponry soldiers in turn he addedreceived encouragement to 
pursue careers in the infantry cavalry or artillery rather than 
the elite special operations forces 
kasich however said lowintensity conflict is the big 
challenge and added it doesnt matter if everybody understands 
it what matters is that you have people in the senate and congress 
who support it

talk show host oprah winfrey received an honorary 
doctorate from morehouse college and gave 1 million to establish a 
scholarship at the private mens college 
the world awaits what you have to give she said after 
receiving an honorary doctor of humane letters degree during 
commencement ceremonies sunday the pressure is on 
ms winfrey said she established the oprah winfrey endowment 
scholarship fund because she felt she should share her good 
fortune she chose morehouse because the students and faculty 
treated her warmly during a january 1988 visit including sending 
her a sweatshirt she said 
i wear that sweatshirt like i know everybody at morehouse 
she said now that i have this doctorate people are going to 
have to get a special dispensation to talk to me 
the college is distinguished by at least one famous graduate 
martin luther king jr 
kings son dexter also attended the school which is the site 
the martin luther king jr international chapel 
earlier sunday ms winfrey told the congregation at west hunter 
street baptist church near downtown atlanta that she tries to 
keep a positive attitude because to do otherwise damages your 
spirit 
ms winfrey recounted stories from her youth while speaking to 
an overflow crowd calling her life a long journey from just a 
little colored girl to an africanamerican woman 
i like a lot of people here spent a lot of time trying to be 
somebody i was not she said i spent a lot of time trying to 
be diana ross then trying just to be someone supreme and to 
stop somebody in the name of love 
she said that because of her celebrity status she is exposed to 
vicious rumors which she tries to ignore 
every single negative thing you do damages your spirit she 
said it keeps you from flying the reason so many people cant 
fly is because theyve got too much garbage in their wings

the average price of gasoline rose a penny a 
gallon in the last two weeks the smallest increase since the 
alaska oil spill sent gas prices soaring an analyst said 
for all grades of gasoline pump prices rose to 11843 per 
gallon between may 5 and friday trilby lundberg said sunday 
wholesale prices dropped only about onethird of a cent per 
gallon during the same period according to the most recent 
lundberg survey of 13000 gasoline stations 
this is the highest overall price seen for the nation since 
january of 1986 just before the world oil price competition cut 
world oil prices in half ms lundberg said of retail prices 
but the recent price hike was the smallest since the march 24 
grounding of the exxon valdez an environmental disaster that 
briefly closed the port of valdez temporarily cutting crude oil 
supplies and sending prices soaring by 10 cents per gallon 
that was followed by another nickelpergallon increase as of 
april 21 ms lundberg said 
heavy competition among wholesalers accounts for the small size 
of the latest increase she said 
wholesalers and refiners knowing full well that the recent 
prices were rapid and surprising to many consumers are trying very 
hard to tow the line and not to lose sales she said 
normally prices continue to rise during the highconsumption 
summer season so the price slowdown may not be a trend ms 
lundberg said 
it is possible that a lull in gasoline price rises will occur 
but it cannot be expected because demand seems strong at a time 
when gasoline supplies are not in surplus she said 
prices at selfserve stations were 10905 per gallon for 
regular unleaded 12415 for premium unleaded and 10742 for 
regular leaded 
full service prices were 13358 cents per gallon for regular 
unleaded 14536 for premium unleaded and 13109 for regular 
leaded

india crossed the threshold of ballistic 
missile capability today by successfully testfiring its first 
mediumrange surfacetosurface missile into the bay of bengal 
news reports said 
the missile was fired from the seaside launch site at chandipur 
about 750 miles southeast of new delhi united news of india said 
the 75ton missile has a range capability of about 1500 miles 
sufficient to hit targets as far as iran hong kong china and 
islands near the equator to the south western military officials 
said 
it can also hit any target in neighboring pakistan india and 
pakistan have fought three wars in the past 42 years 
defense experts say the missiles oneton payload capability is 
more than enough to carry a nuclear warhead 
the test firing was indias third attempt at launching the agni 
missile whose name means fire in the ancient sanskrit language 
the first firing scheduled for april 20 was postponed by 
lastminute problems with the ignition system a second launch set 
for may 1 was canceled after an error in one of the rockets 
subsystems 
by successfully firing the missile india joined the united 
states the soviet union china france and britain in ballistic 
missile capability 
united news of india said 11000 people living in 13 villages 
near the launch site were evacuated from their homes sunday evening 
as a security measure the villagers have protested the testfiring 
for fear the government would force them to relocate permanently if 
more launches are held at chandipur 
britain indias colonia ruler first used the site in 1893 to 
test ammunition the indians turned it into a missile test range in 
1986 because of an unusual feature it faced the bay of bengal and 
during low tide the sea recedes up to two miles enabling faster 
and easier recovery of shells and other shortrange projectiles 
the bay also has light commercial and naval traffic 
india has said it intends to use its nuclear capacity only for 
peaceful purposes 
western military experts in new delhi questioned the stance from 
a military standpoint however 
you need accuracy or a point target if you are using a 
conventional warhead said one western analyst speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
but if you are using a nuclear warhead the exact target does 
not matter he said i am not saying that the indians are going 
to use a nuclear warhead but the question is why not 
india exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago and western 
nuclear experts believe that scientists can assemble an atomic 
weapon in one week 
india says its nuclear program is intended for nonmilitary 
purposes such as generating power the test firing of the 
intermediaterange ballistic missile or irbm was only a 
technology demonstration of the countrys capabilities according 
to the government 
india previously testfired three surfacetosurface and 
surfacetoair missiles with ranges of about 20 miles to 150 miles

folks in these parts dont have to go 
all the way to pisa to see the leaning tower after a stubborn 
highrise refused to collapse despite two demolition blasts 
weve got one building leaning and one building leaning 
against it police maj john power said sunday its a 
hazardous condition and i dont know what could happen 
a cloud of smoke rose from the bottom of the 10story building 
about 830 am but the structure remained standing patrolman 
john egan said demolition crews were unsure why the implosion 
failed to work 
the demolition experts who had used 500 pounds of dynamite in 
the first implosion fetched 36 pounds of more explosives for the 
second try this time part of the building tipped slightly and 
leaned against another tower but the structure remained standing 
power said a few families living nearby would have to find 
somewhere else to stay until the building was brought down 
residents without a place to go would be accommodated officials 
said 
stephen orourke head of the citys housing authority said it 
could take two weeks for the wrecking crews to dismantle the 
listing building 
the providence housing authority had planned to tear down the 
complex and build smaller buildings for housing city officials 
felt that tearing down the deteriorating towers would be cheaper 
than renovation 
the tower and two others are the subject of a federal suit filed 
by project basic a housing advocacy group against the housing 
authority us district judge raymond pettine allowed the tower to 
be demolished after architects ruled that the building when being 
prepared for demolition was made unsafe

it has climbed 601 yen since may 11 
dealers said dollar buying also was encouraged by the dollars 
continued rise despite intervention by the bank of japan the 
central bank sold an estimated 2 billion 
the unrest in beijing was the direct motivation for the dollar 
buying said a dealer at a major commercial bank speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
dealers also mentioned political uncertainty in japan where the 
ruling party has been unable so far to find a successor for prime 
minister noboru takeshita who is resigning over an 
influencepeddling scandal

selected issues a 14465point gainer on friday added another

sidelines to watch developments in exchange rates and in the 
domestic political situation

shares 
until the market environment clears we can hardly predict the 
market direction right now said a dealer at a major brokerage 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
dealers attributed the slight gain in the nikkei index to rises 
in overseas stock markets last week 
the market itself is ready for another rally and we just have 
to wait for the environment to calm down the dealer said

crockett and tubbs solved their last case on 
nbcs miami vice tossed in their badges after breaking all the 
rules and rode off more or less into the sunset alive and well 
the rumor was that either sonny crockett played by don johnson 
or ricardo tubbs played by philip michael thomas would die in the 
final twohour show which was broadcast sunday night but both 
survived several gunfights winding up five years on the air 
as the hip stylish series ended tubbs was preparing to return 
to new york crockett was heading south 
crockett said im going where the waters warm the drinks 
are cold and i dont know the name of the players 
their final case was a suicide mission to a latin american 
country to snatch a dictator during a revolution as usual they 
were doublecrossed at every turn but still came out the winners 
in the finale they took on federal agents trying to spirit the 
dictator away to freedom in violation of an agreement that he would 
turn informer on his drugdealing partners 
their own police chief was on the colombian payroll and was 
killed the dictator died as crockett and tubbs shot down his 
seaplane when it was taking off on the miami waterfront 
miami vice made quite a splash with its debut in september 
1984 johnson and thomas portrayed two dashing vicesquad 
detectives on floridas gold coast they dressed in expensive 
pastelcolored clothing drove a ferrari and solved their cases in 
glamorous settings to the accompaniment of pulsating rock music 
johnson became a sex symbol as the macho detective who wore a 
threeday growth of beard and no socks he parlayed his fame into a 
budding film career edward james olmos also gained a movie career 
from his role as the mystical taciturn lt castillo 
the glitz soon wore off after the first year the stories 
became mere excuses for crockett and tubbs to tool around in 
nighttime miami as the lights bounced off their ferrari or as 
backdrops for the fashion show 
in the final season at the insistence of nbc the scripts were 
improved but the ratings continued to slip 
at the beginning of the last season executive producer michael 
mann made preparations to end the show he said he wanted the 
series to go off in as stylish a manner as it had gone on 
last season crockett married a rock singer played by sheena 
easton but after several shows she was killed the current season 
opened with crockett believing he actually was his undercover alter 
ego drug dealer sonny burnett 
guest stars on the series over the years included singers phil 
collins little richard james brown ted nugent and the fat boys 
convicted watergate conspirator g gordon liddy also made an 
appearance as did chrysler chairman lee iacocca

something you can do in some cases death seems more desirable 
but there is always something you can do

cancer is about the most unfunny thing in the world

gilda radners classmates and teachers remember 
how she made them laugh long before her zany characters on 
saturday night live made the nation laugh 
while the show business world paid homage to radner 42 who 
died saturday in los angeles after a threeyear battle against 
ovarian cancer the comedian was recalled by those who knew her in 
her native michigan 
her sense of humor was constant and engaging said richard 
burgwin a retired university of michigan drama professor when 
she was a student in ann arbor we sort of got a free saturday 
night live every day because of that bubbling attitude toward 
life and it was original 
radner was a wonderful fountain of wit and joy burgwin said 
in a telephone interview from his home in bradenton fla 
betty irwin remembered the time in high school when radner acted 
like her saturday night live costar chevy chase 
there was a play once the mouse that roared said irwin 
a classmate of radners at the liggett school in grosse pointe 
she was upstairs in the dressing room trying to get dressed lee 
jenkins was the queen on stage gilda lost her balance and 
literally rolled down the stairs and onto the stage 
she began adlibbing right away irwin said the teacher 
behind the stage was just having a fit because she couldnt follow 
the script it was really cute 
born in detroit radner attended the allgirls liggett school 
and graduated in 1964 
in her freshman year radner performed with her school choir 
with the detroit symphony orchestra at ford auditorium in her 
junior year she transferred to detroit mumford high school and 
worked as a volunteer at sinai hospital 
actually i was going to teach retarded kids i used to work 
with the emotionally disturbed in detroit she told the new york 
daily news in 1977 
she returned to liggett for her senior year then enrolled at 
the university of michigan as a drama student she left without 
obtaining a degree 
i think she was bored quite frankly burgwin said there 
are performers who need and want training and there are others who 
are themselves and ready to go 
i think gilda made the right judgment what we had to give was 
not what she needed

roulette wheels came to rest and the 
last card was turned onto the blackjack felt at elsinores atlantis 
casino hotel today as it became the first new jersey casino closed 
under state order 
when dealer stan kowal dealt his last hand at 347 am more 
state gaming regulators were in the casino than customers and 
gamblers were saying good luck to atlantis employees 
the state casino control commission last week determined the 
gaming halls 144 million debt was too big a risk to the 
industrys integrity to allow continued play on atlantis 
threetiered casino floor 
only subtle signs indicated casino employees were working their 
last shift a blackjack dealer taped a small goodbye note to 
his table and some floor supervisors wore blacktinged carnations 
at the craps table larry fishman threw out the last set of dice 
i enjoyed myself here for seven years he said i wanted 
to do it for sentimental reasons i guess 
atlantis has been plagued with financial problems since 1981 
when it opened as the playboy hotel amp casino 
in november 1985 atlantis filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection but when a reorganization plan was finally implemented 
in september 1988 the losses continued to mount 
the state division of gaming enforcement the arm of the state 
attorney generals office that polices the industry reported that 
the atlantis was losing money at the rate of 56000 a day 
at the divisions recommendation the commission voted in april 
not to renew atlantis regular casino license and appointed a 
conservator 
at least 1000 of the hotels 2000 workers are affected by the 
casino closing 
near the slot machines mechanics gathered to console each other 
this morning 
ordinarily wed be fixing machines but it doesnt matter 
now said one mechanic who would identify himself only as john 
it took me a year and a half to get this job and now im out 
looking again 
the fate of the casino rests in the hands of the casino 
commission although developer donald trump has an agreement to 
purchase the place from elsinore corp for 63 million the 
stateappointed conservator joseph m nolan has recommended that 
trumps agreement be rejected 
nolan argued that the deal was signed after he was in place as 
conservator and that higher bids have been made 
he also suggested that trump who already owns two casinos and 
is building a third would wield too much economic power if he 
bought the atlantis and converted it into a luxury noncasino hotel 
as planned 
the atlantis closing does not necessarily mark the end of the 
legalized gambling experiment to rejuvenate the decaying 
resort said marvin b roffman a gaming analyst with the 
philadelphia investment house of janney montgomery scott inc 
but it does forewarn of other impending closures he said 
theyd better get used to these failures he said theres 
going to be a bunch of them simply because the casino industry is 
so strung out now on debt last years debt was over 2 billion 
and this years will be even higher

at a rally attended by tens of thousands boris 
yeltsin and other reformers elected to the new soviet congress were 
cheered as they swore to substitute their radical agenda for that 
of the communist party 
if at this historic moment that is so important for the 
future of our country we permit the apparatus to dictate to us as 
it has in past decades we will not advance but sink back into the 
swamp from which wed only begun to extricate ourselves yeltsin 
told sundays rally 
the communist party whose members constitute 80 percent of the 
new congress of peoples deputies convened a session of its 
policymaking central committee today to work out its plans for the 
body which meets in inaugural session thursday 
but many of the 2250 members of the new congress are 
independentminded communists and it was not known if they would 
follow the party line 
yeltsin a onetime moscow party boss is himself a member of 
the partys 251member central committee and at sundays rally he 
and his antiestablishment colleagues called for contested 
presidential elections and urgent action on the economy 
he demanded that president mikhail s gorbachev give a public 
accounting of the first four years of his reforms during the 
opening session only then should the congress decide if gorbachev 
should be reelected president yeltsin declared 
the reformers talk of specific legislative proposals indicated 
they may try to create a congress with far greater power than 
gorbachev may have intended according to legislation approved last 
fall the body would have just one regular session a year and elect 
from among its members the president as well as the smaller 
working parliament the supreme soviet 
human rights activist andrei sakharov told sundays rally that 
the congress itself not the supreme soviet should be the supreme 
legislative authority 
the congress directly elected by the people and a number of 
official organizations includes hundreds of reformers 
it is not clear if the reformers constitute a large enough 
faction to win selection to the working parliament 
the partys intentions remained unclear all 12 full members of 
its ruling politburo were elected deputies but it was not known if 
they intend to serve in the supreme soviet as well 
many soviets hope the congress will take swift action on 
problems ranging from empty store shelves to the unresolved ethnic 
conflict between armenians and azerbaijanis 
the radical tone of sundays rally which drew an estimated at 
30000 people was demonstrated by the loud cheers that greeted 
deputy alexander tolstoukhovs suggestion that we should elect 
true peoples power with a true peoples president yeltsin 
yeltsin was ousted as moscow party boss in november 1987 and 
lost his seat on the partys ruling politburo after he criticized 
the slow pace of gorbachevs reforms 
he made a comeback in the march congressional elections 
however when his antiestablishment platform captured almost 90 
percent of the vote in moscow 
yeltsin on sunday called for convening an extraordinary party 
congress that would be empowered to replace old guard communists 
on the central committee and politburo 
he said a group of 39 deputies elected to represent moscow in 
the new congress has drafted its own agenda for the session and 
demands radical decisions on reviving the stagnant economy 
guaranteeing social justice and developing a more open society 
yeltsin said that only after addressing that agenda and 
evaluating gorbachevs performance should the congress proceed to 
elect the chairman of the presidium of the supreme soviet from 
among alternative candidates 
gorbachev was unanimously elected to that post without an 
opponent on oct 1 but that election was by the supreme soviet 
which has until recently been a rubber stamp legislature 
two prosecutors who have been accused of abusing their office in 
conducting a probe of alleged official corruption also addressed 
the rally to deafening cheers 
nikolai ivanov who was accused of slander after he said 
publicly the names of politburo member yegor k ligachev and former 
politburo member mikhail s solomentsev came up in his probe 
called for a wider investigation of former high officials 
fellow prosecutor and deputy telman gdlyan said the party and 
government apparatus is scared by the people the soviet union 
he said is in the very depths of an economic political moral 
and legal crisis he demanded that apparatchiks give up power 
to the people

prosecutors filed bribery charges today against two 
leading politicians the first elected officials formally accused 
in the recruit influencepeddling scandal 
prosecutors said the two received donations and highly 
discounted stock shares from the recruit co in exchange for using 
their political clout to help the companys magazine publishing 
business 
charged were takao fujinami 56 a former cabinet minister and 
member of the governing liberal democratic party and katsuya 
ikeda 52 former secretary general of the opposition komeito or 
clean government party they were not taken into custody 
the bribery charge carries a sevenyear prison sentence 
before today 14 bureaucrats and businessmen had been charged in 
the scandal which has eroded public trust in politics 
last month prime minister noboru takeshita said he would resign 
to take responsibility the liberal democrats still are searching 
for a successor most of the partys senior members have been 
linked to the scandal 
prosecutors questioned fujinami and ikeda several times last 
week and their homes and offices were searched on thursday 
ikeda a former journalist and fourterm member of parliaments 
lower house said in a statement today that the charges are not 
the truth they are a fabrication of reality 
fujinami said today that he would resign from the governing 
party kyodo news service reported ikeda announced last week he 
would resign from komeito and parliament 
fujinami the chief government spokesman in former prime 
minister yasuhiro nakasones cabinet and an eightterm member of 
the lower house was widely considered a rising star among liberal 
democrats 
he has acknowledged that an aide bought 12000 shares of stock 
in a recruit subsidiary at discounted prices in 1986 and then 
profited by about 215000 when the stock was listed for public 
trading and rose rapidly in value fujinami used a portion of the 
profit to buy a house in tokyo according to news reports 
fujinami a former labor minister also reportedly received 
about 640000 in political donations from the company 
ikeda has admitted that his brother bought 5000 shares of stock 
in the recruit subsidiary and profited by about 70000 ikeda 
allegedly received 100000 in donations from recruit 
both politicians have denied personal involvement in the stock 
transactions 
prosecutors say profits from the transactions were deposited in 
the politicians bank accounts 
they say ikeda and fujinami used their political influence to 
persuade government officials to continue a gentlemens 
agreement among government agencies and private companies on a 
uniform date for the hiring of graduating college students recruit 
believed the agreement was crucial for the sale of its employment 
magazines prosecutors say 
prosecutors now have completed the bribery investigation in the 
scandal and now will focus on illegal political donations made by 
recruit an information services and publishing conglomerate news 
reports said 
japanese law limits the amount of money that companies can 
donate to politicians a company the size of recruit is restricted 
to about 110000 in political donations a year 
prime minister takeshita has acknowledged that he received about 
1 million in donations from recruit betweeb 1985 and 1987 
the liberal democrats last week agreed to the oppositions 
demand that nakasone testify before parliament about any links he 
may have to recruit he is expected to testify on thursday

curiosity is luring 
tourists to americas oldest national park a year after fire 
scarred roughly half of its 22 million acres 
i havent been here since i was a kid said john gurrad of 
albuquerque nm if the fires hadnt happened i wouldnt have 
come here 
robert barbee superintendent of the 117yearold park said 
saturday that predictions that curiosity would attract visitors 
appeared to be coming true 
there was great concern early on because reservations were 
down he said but that has reversed itself in april our 
reservations were 29 percent above last april i am convinced we 
are going to have an excellent season 
officials for tw recreational services the parks chief 
concessionaire report bookings at the old faithful inn the only 
lodging open during the parks early spring season were running 5 
percent ahead of projections 
sharon roe front office manager said all 327 rooms have been 
booked since may 14 
some areas that were burned are erupting in the reds yellows 
and oranges of wildflowers although many areas remain blackened 
from the fires 
i didnt think it would be as bad as what i read said larry 
long a park visitor and i dont think it is i think it will 
get better over time 
on saturday nbc anchorman tom brokaw speaking at a conference 
of the greater yellowstone coalition defended news coverage of the 
fires he said the impression the park was destroyed was reached 
largely by the news audience itself 
too many people think of a national park as a city park 
except larger he said the same popular perception applies to 
fires they think of flames only as a destructive force when there 
are fires in a national park to most people that is not good 
news 
visitors on saturday said they did not believe the fires took 
anything away from the parks basic beauty 
i think a lot of it here is still really pretty gurrad 
said but there are going to be some pretty ugly spots too 
there are some spots that are really dead

the peoples liberation army once rooted in 
rigid communist ideology was making a transition from 
revolutionary force to modern army when it was confronted by the 
surprising strength of the prodemocracy movement 
although the imposition of martial law makes the demonstrations 
in beijing illegal solidiers have been reluctant unable or 
ordered not to halt them 
young soldiers waiting in convoys on the outskirts of the 
capital took cigarettes and drinks from protesters and listened 
intently as students lectured them on the campaign for democratic 
reform some flashed vforvictory signs when their trucks 
retreated away from the city 
it has become even harder to decipher how senior military 
officers were reacting to the most serious challenge to the social 
order the communist party has faced in its 40year rule 
senior leader deng xiaopings one remaining official post is as 
head of the central military commission and it is believed to have 
been deng who ordered the crackdown on the student movement 
the 84yearold deng is certain to have the support of other 
older officers who served in the old red army and continue to 
regard the peoples liberation army as the last bastion of 
revolutionary integrity 
less certain is the backing of younger officers the plas new 
ranks of professionals who may share some of the students concerns 
about the slow pace of political reform in china 
the pla played a major role in restoring order during the 
chaotic 196676 cultural revolution when fighting between 
different leftist factions brought china to the brink of civil war 
since then however the nations trust in the ideological 
purity of the pla has begun to slip 
in the early 1980s the army abandoned mao tsetungs concept of 
a guerrilla peoples war in which the army would beat back an 
attacker through sheer numbers and revolutionary fervor 
deng has reduced the number of troops by about 1 million since 
1985 when china fielded 42 million soldiers he has brought back 
a ranking system abandoned for 23 years emphasized better training 
and sought to create a modern military force 
the pla however has been saddled with severe budgetary 
restrictions as government funds were channeled to economic 
modernization programs about twothirds of defense industry 
factories have been switched to making civilian goods to help boost 
national production and exports 
from 1950 to 1980 defense spending accounted for 172 percent 
of chinas state expenditures the pla says in 1988 it received 
only 749 percent of the budget defense spending in actual terms 
is expected to fall about 6 percent this year after inflation 
in the past pla ranks were filled with young people attracted 
to the prestige of a military career and the possibility of 
escaping rural poverty pla members still command respect but the 
low pay and harsh living conditions have made recruiting more 
difficult 
in welloff rural areas families commonly pay off local 
officials to keep their sons off local quota lists for enlistment 
one recent report in the official media said the army is ending 
up with soldiers who are mentally retarded or illiterate or who 
have criminal records 
many recruits are eager to finish their term and return to 
civilian life so they can make money to buy the material comforts 
young people have come to expect such recruits are now listening 
with sympathy when students their own age chant the peoples army 
belongs to the people

his campaign has a right to question the link between panamanian 
dictator manuel noriega and rudolph giuliani lauders rival for 
the gop nomination

the law firm white amp case which lists panama as a client the firm 
has said it has done no work for noriega himself

sixty lawmakers from the governing 
nationalist party demanded today a halt to all private contacts 
with china to protest the communist governments hard line against 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
we should suspend our policy of opening up toward the mainland 
until the chinese communists lift martial law and end any military 
crackdown the legislators said in a statement to the government 
on saturday chinese premier li peng imposed martial law in 
beijing and ordered troops to end massive protests that have spread 
through china the past month his hardline policy has encountered 
resistance and reports from beijing on monday said military 
leaders have opposed it 
the taiwan lawmakers said the nationalist government should 
offer to open direct trade and shipping links between the rival 
nations if china cancels the crackdown order and acknowledges the 
protests are patriotic and democratic the legislature which 
is dominated by the nationalist party has 297 seats 
the nationalists who fled to taiwan in 1949 when they lost a 
civil war on the mainland continue to claim they are the 
legitimate government of all china they are technically still at 
war with the chinese communists and they have refused to have any 
direct contacts with the mainland government 
but in the past two years they have pursued a flexible policy 
that has allowed taiwanese and chinese to exchange visits and trade 
through third countries 
government spokesman shaw yuming said on sunday that taiwan 
would continue to pursue its flexible policy but would reassess it 
if the situation on the mainland deteriorates and threatens to 
endanger taiwan residents 
legislator huang chuwen who initiated the statement signed by 
60 lawmakers said a successful military crackdown could set back 
democracy on the mainland by 20 years and we would miss a good 
opportunity to reunite china peacefully 
the nationalists ended 38 years of martial law in 1987 they say 
china and taiwan considered a chinese province by both the 
nationalists and communists should be reunited under a democratic 
system 
the legislators said they will submit their statement to the 
lawmaking legislative yuan for discussion tuesday and then relay it 
to the government cabinet 
also monday hu chinheng 35 a clerk at the ministry of 
communications began a threeday hunger strike in taipei to 
protest what he described as taiwanese indifference to the 
democracy movement in china 
hu a native taiwanese staged his strike at a park dedicated to 
the late president chiang kaishek who led the defeated 
nationalists to taiwan from the mainland chiang died in 1975 
students and faculty at some universities have signed petitions 
supporting the democracy movement in china but there have been no

israeli troops in the occupied gaza strip 
detained more than 250 moslem fundamentalists and seized a cache of 
automatic weapons in the biggest arrest raid since the palestinian 
uprising began the army announced 
in the occupied west bank today unidentified gunmen fired three 
shots at police in the center of bethlehem police and army 
officials said one shot hit a police car but no one was injured 
israel radio said soldiers at a hitchhiking post in the negev 
desert reported gunmen in a passing car shot at them today they 
were not hit 
the shootings and discovery of the weapons cache came amid 
mounting concern over palestinian threats to step up violence and 
end a policy of not using guns in the 17monthold uprising 
col renaan gissin the deputy army spokesman said there 
recently has been an increase in palestinians use of firearms 
we see it as a grave development he said in an interview 
elsewhere today soldiers shot and wounded two palestinians in a 
clash in the gaza strip refugee camp of dir el balah and six women 
were hurt by metal pellets fired by soldiers in the west bank town 
of tulkarem arab reports said 
in clashes on sunday soldiers shot and killed two palestinians 
and wounded at least 25 according to hospital reports the deaths 
raised to 496 the number of palestinians killed since the uprising 
against israeli rule of the occupied lands began in december 1987 
twentytwo israelis have been slain 
maj gen yitzhak mordechai head of the armys central command 
said the arrest operation in the gaza strip was a decisive blow 
to hamas an organization of moslem fundamentalists 
in the long term there will be a reduction of violence in 
the area mordechai said in comments broadcast on israel radio 
hamas which means zeal in arabic takes a harder line than 
the palestine liberation organization in seeking an islamic nation 
that would exclude the existence of a jewish state many of its 
leaders oppose peace negotiations with israel 
an army announcement said security forces confiscated 18 
weapons including pistols usmade m16 and soviet kalashnikov 
automatic rifles israeli uzi submachine guns and swedish karl 
gustav rifles 
the statement said hamas members fired at an israeli car and an 
israeli man digging a well in gaza in march 1988 the group also 
was blamed for throwing an explosive device at israeli soldiers 
according to the army hamas planned antiisraeli 
demonstrations firebombed shops of storekeepers who violated 
strike orders by the uprising leadership and killed arabs suspected 
of collaborating with israel or those who were involved in drugs 
and prostitution 
about 45 suspected collaborators have been killed in the 
uprising 
mordechai said that among those detained was sheikh ahmed 
yassin the spiritual leader of hamas who was accused of ordering 
beatings and shootings of suspected collaborators 
yassin who is paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair had been 
sentenced to 12 years in jail in 1984 after being convicted of 
having knowledge of concealed weapons he was released in a 
prisoner exchange in 1985 
the raids against hamas were conducted during a sixday curfew 
in the gaza strip that confined some 700000 people to their homes 
the army lifted the curfew on sunday but few gazans went to 
their jobs in israel because of a strike ordered by leaders of the 
uprising 
there was increased concern that palestinians had escalated 
their rebellion 
a leaflet published this week by proplo activists called on 
palestinians to kill an israeli soldier or settler for every 
palestinian killed by israeli soldiers 
last week three palestinians fired on israeli troops in a west 
bank village killing one soldier and wounding seven before they 
were killed it was the first gun battle of the uprising 
mohammed abbas the chief of a radical plo faction also called 
for the use of firearms by palestinians in an interview published 
in the kuwaiti daily al watan on sunday 
the united states has accused abbas also known as abul abbas 
of involvement in the 1985 hijacking of the italian cruise ship 
achille lauro in which an american leon klinghoffer of new york 
was killed

the soviet union said today it will cut sharply 
the number of british employees in moscow apparently in 
retaliation for the expulsions from britain of 11 soviets accused 
of espionage 
britain said on sunday that it secretly ordered the expulsion of 
eight soviet diplomats and three journalists on friday on 
saturday the soviet union retaliated with an identical set of 
expulsions of britons 
the soviets took the diplomatic rift a step further today 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasmiov told a news 
conference that the number of britons accredited in moscow and the 
number of soviets working for britons would be reduced from 375 to 
205 
the new limit for british employees would be equal to the number 
of soviets now permitted to work in britain 
the british embassy had no immediate comment on gerasimovs 
statement 
gerasimov did not say how long the reductions would take or who 
exactly they would affect 
in london today the soviet embassy said britain provoked the 
dispute with its expulsions on friday 
embassy counselor lev parshin called the expulsion order 
deplorable unfriendly and provocative and said it remains to 
be seen how the dispute will affect anglosoviet relations 
he denied that the expelled soviets had done anything wrong 
britain on sunday said its expulsions were legitimate though it 
did not give details and that the soviet response was unjustified 
independent television news radio said the soviets had been caught 
spying on military installations 
both countries expelled eight diplomats and three journalists 
and each was was given 14 days to leave 
prime minister margaret thatcher told the british broadcasting 
corp she was disappointed britain had to expel the soviets but 
we gave them the chance and they have not taken it and they have 
revealed their true nature 
she said britain had hoped a new era was being ushered into the 
soviet union by president mikhail gorbachev but many things are 
still the same 
the rift came at a time of improved relations between the 
nations the two leaders enjoy a good personal relationship and 
gorbachev received a warm greeting when he visited london in early 
may 
one of the expelled journalists sunday times correspondent 
angus roxburgh denied spying and said he was angry with london and 
moscow over being caught up in the latest diplomatic chess game 
why do the british have such a predilection for expelling 
soviet spies presumably there are as many russians engaged in 
impermissible activities in west germany france or the us yet 
expulsions from those countries are much rarer he wrote in the 
times today 
the other journalists expelled on saturday jeremy harris of the 
british broadcasting corp and ian gloverjames of independent 
television news also denied improper conduct 
im not guilty of any spying lawbreaking or any impermissible 
activity he said 
bbcs deputy directorgeneral john birt said the bbc would 
vigorously resist harris expulsion 
the british foreign office accused the soviets of incompatible 
activities diplomatic parlance for espionage 
foreign minister sir geoffrey howe called britains action a 
measured action in respect of established misbehavior britain 
had incontrovertible evidence of wrongdoing by the expelled 
soviets he said 
asked why the british government kept its expulsions quiet the 
foreign office spokesman said we look at these on a casebycase 
basis and in this case we decided not to initiate publicity 
the opposition labor party said mrs thatchers conservative 
government had kept a bizarre and inexplicable silence 
the british public deserve a lot more information before they 
will accept that this is justified said party spokesman george 
robertson 
the diplomatic row was the biggest between the two countries 
since 1985 when both expelled 31 diplomats journalists and other 
representatives in 1971 britain expelled 105 soviets 
the soviet move against britain on monday could mirror action it 
took against the united states in the middle of a spying dispute in 
october 1986 in that case the soviets stripped the us embassy 
of 260 soviet employees who handled many of the missions 
nondiplomatic jobs 
since then the us embassy has operated without soviet 
employees

seventyfive potential jurors began filling out 
questionnaires today for the trial of pat swindall a twoterm 
republican congressman who lost his seat while under the cloud of a 
perjury indictment 
us district judge richard freeman has said he wants to try to 
seat a jury before ruling on swindalls request to move the trial 
out of town 
a judge aborted swindalls first trial six months ago after 
swindall campaign mailings proclaiming his innocence arrived at the 
homes of at least two jurors 
freeman set aside the entire day to complete the questionnaires 
and allow lawyers to study the answers questioning of prospective 
jurors was set for tuesday 
swindall who acted as his own attorney last fall is 
represented this time by richard hendrix a former federal 
prosecutor 
swindall was indicted oct 17 on 10 counts of lying to a federal 
grand jury each charge carries 10 months to five years in prison 
the trial could determine his political future the 38yearold 
conservative has said he would like to run against democratic sen 
sam nunn in 1990 
swindall is accused of lying to a grand jury in 1988 when he 
said he did not remember being told that an 850000 home mortgage 
loan he was seeking might be coming from illegal drug proceeds 
swindall negotiated the loan with a money broker who turned out 
to be an undercover federal agent and the prosecution has a 
recording of the agent telling swindall he had a gut feeling 
drugs were involved 
in october swindall running for reelection and hoping to 
clear his name waived his right to file pretrial motions and got 
an immediate trial 
but judge robert vining aborted the trial 
swindall lost his seat in atlantas eastern suburbs to democrat 
ben jones on nov 8

the supreme court today agreed to study a 
federal regulation aimed at saving the government time and money 
when it mistakenly overpays some social security recipients 
the court said it will study a ruling in a colorado case that 
struck down the regulation 
the regulation applies to two social security programs old age 
survivors and disability insurance benefits and supplemental 
security income 
adopted by the department of health and human services the rule 
covers instances in which the government at different times 
overpays and underpays benefit recipients 
the rule allows officials to balance the overpayments against 
underpayments arriving at a net amount that is either owed the 
government or the recipient 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals based in denver ruled 
last august that the regulation is illegal because it may operate 
to deprive needy recipients of the chance to keep overpayments 
the appeals court ruling applies to recipients in colorado 
kansas new mexico oklahoma utah and wyoming federal appeals 
courts elsewhere have handed down conflicting rulings 
the 10th circuit court said federal law requires that the 
government abandon recovery of overpayments when a recipient is 
blameless or if returning the extra benefits would cause the 
recipient serious hardship 
the appeals court rejected government arguments that allowing 
recipients to keep the extra money is an unfair windfall 
an overpaid beneficiary who does not have to repay excess 
benefits is not receiving a windfall but rather is benefitting from 
congress express provision that recovery by the government must 
be waived in appropriate situations the appeals court said 
in the appeal acted on today justice department laywers said 
the appeals court misunderstood the way the disputed regulation 
works they said the rule would not deprive needy people of the 
opportunity eventually to keep the extra money 
the government said the regulation would spare the government 
from paying out millions of extra dollars automatically and then 
going through an elaborate procedure to recover some of the money 
government lawyers said that from 1981 to 1986 an average of 47 
million people each year received too much or too little due to 
errors in the retirement and survivors insurance program alone 
the case is sullivan vs everhart 881323

mass murderer john wayne gacy convicted and 
sentenced to death in 1980 for killing 33 boys and young men lost 
a supreme court appeal today 
the justices rejected arguments that illinois death penalty law 
wrongly gives county prosecutors complete and unguided discretion 
to determine whether to seek the death penalty in murder cases 
gacys appeal also had contended that he was denied a fair trial 
because the presiding judge limited the testimony of an expert 
psychiatric witness for the defense 
both arguments were rejected by the illinois supreme court last 
sept 29 
the high courts action came without comment other than a 
dissenting statement by justices william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall who oppose capital punishment under all circumstances 
no one in us history has been convicted of killing more people 
than gacy 
police found 29 of gacys victims in the crawl space beneath his 
norwood park township home in chicago four more had been in nearby 
rivers 
prosecutors said the murders were committed over a threeyear 
period beginning in 1975 
gacy said he strangled all but one of the 33 by wrapping rope 
around their necks and twisting it with a stick he sexually 
assaulted some of the victims before killing them 
a chicago native gacy lived in springfield ill and in iowa 
before returning to chicago in the early 1970s to start a 
successful remodeling business he often hired teenage boys 
gacy who received death sentences for 12 of the murders and 
life terms for each of the remaining 21 now resides at menard 
correctional center in chester ill 
a january execution date was postponed and no new date has been 
set the last execution in illinois occurred in 1962 
gacys name surfaced briefly in the 1988 presidential campaign 
when a pamphlet distributed by illinois republicans contended that 
gacy would have been eligible for weekend passes had he committed 
his crimes in massachusetts under gov michael dukakis 
administration 
dukakis labeled the pamphlet garbage and gacy later wrote 
to state republican officials to complain about what he called the 
sleazy tactic 
the case is gacy vs illinois 886828

the supreme court today refused to shield 
chicago from being sued for monetary damages in state court for 
allegedly allowing excessive noise and air pollution at ohare 
international airport 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that could 
allow such lawsuits 
chicago owns and operates ohare one of the worlds busiest 
airports lawyers for the city said the number of flights in and 
out of ohare is projected to rise to over one million a year by 
1995 
lawrence bieneman who since 1967 has lived in suburban 
bensenville sued the city and various other defendants in federal 
court over ohare the suit included allegations that bienemans 
constitutionally protected property rights were being violated and 
that the airport was a nuisance 
a federal trial judge threw out the entire lawsuit but the 7th 
us circuit court of appeals said last dec 13 that the judge had 
gone too far 
the appeals court ruled that bieneman should have a chance to 
prove the nuisance and other state tort law claims in an illinois 
court 
such a lawsuit is not preempted by federal law the appeals 
court said 
the supreme court in 1973 ruled that state and local regulations 
of airports and air travel generally must yield to federal control 
the court said an airport may not be charged with negligence or 
creating a nuisance for conduct that complies with federal laws and 
regulations 
but the 1973 decision did not involve a governmentrun airport 
and a nowdisputed footnote to that ruling said we do not 
consider here what limits if any apply to a municipality as a 
proprietor 
in bienemans case the 7th circuit court said neither the 
constitution nor the federal aviation act as amended by the noise 
control act of 1972 determines how illinois apportions its 
governmental powers 
the appeals court said the 1973 supreme court ruling allows 
states to govern the operation of publicly owned airports it 
ordered that bienemans suit be dismissed without prejudice so he 
could pursue his case in state court 
in chicagos appeal lawyers for the city argued with jet 
travel comes noise and with such noise come attempts by state and 
local governments and by individuals such as bieneman to limit 
noise 
to the extent such state and local measures pertain to noise 
from planes in flight the appeal said they run afoul of the 
federal regulatory scheme and of considerations of interstate 
commerce 
the justices today also rejected a separate appeal by bieneman 
seeking to revive his constitutional claims and a third appeal by 
numerous airlines operating out of ohare 
the cases are chicago vs bieneman 881496 bieneman vs 
chicago 881497 and amerian airlines vs chicago 881670

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
a former chicago councilman convicted of fraud for conspiring 
illegally to buy and sell taxdelinquent properties 
the court over one dissenting vote refused to use the case of 
thomas e keane to set guidelines on when some people may challenge 
their fraud convictions after completing prison terms for those 
convictions 
only justice harry a blackmun voted to hear arguments in 
keanes case 
keane 83 was paroled in 1978 after nearly two years in prison 
lower courts said in effect keane now has too little at stake 
to mount such a challenge 
the bush administration although agreeing with the lower 
courts nevertheless urged the justices to hear keanes appeal 
justice department lawyers said the case should be used to resolve 
a recurring conflict among federal courts 
for example former maryland gov marvin mandels conviction 
under the same federal antifraud law was overturned by a federal 
judge in 1987 after mandel was released from prison the 4th us 
circuit court of appeals upheld that ruling 
the bush administration has an appeal pending before the high 
court that seeks to reinstate mandels conviction which stemmed 
from a scheme to help friends who owned a racetrack in return for 
more than 380000 in gifts 
in the case acted on today keane was convicted in 1974 of mail 
fraud prosecutors said that while a city councilman he formed a 
secret partnership to acquire taxdelinquent property at cook 
county scavenger sales 
the prosecutors said keane used his influence as chairman of the 
city councils finance committee to reduce tax liens on the parcels 
and then convinced friends at public agencies to buy the parcels at 
more than their market price 
there was conflicting evidence at the trial as to whether keane 
made a profit from his efforts a separate state court trial 
concluded that keane did not make any money 
the jury in the federal trial was told it could convict keane of 
fraud without finding that he made any profit or that the taxpayers 
suffered a tangible loss 
a guilty verdict could be based on a finding keane defrauded the 
citizens of chicago of their intangible right to his faithful and 
loyal services the jury was told 
after his federal conviction keane was sentenced to prison and 
fined 27000 
years after he was freed and completed his parole the supreme 
court ruled in 1987 that a federal mail fraud conviction may not be 
based on a defendants defrauding the public of its intangible 
right to honest and impartial government 
the justices said there must be some tangible loss suffered by 
taxpayers 
that ruling prompted keane to go back to the federal courts to 
have his conviction overturned he also sought return of the 
27000 fine 
a federal judge threw out keanes challenge and the decision 
was upheld last july by the 7th us circuit court of appeals 
the appeals court said too little was at stake for the courts to 
expend valuable resources to consider the challenge years after 
keane had served his time in prison 
the 27000 fine is a sunk cost rather than a continuing 
disability producing additional injury as time passes the 
appeals court said 
it also said the harm to keanes reputation does not justify 
the investment of judicial time necessary to decide whether he is 
entitled to vindication 
keane might have been convicted of mail fraud even if the jury 
were told to base its verdict on a tangible loss of property the 
7th circuit court added 
no one can accept without unease the thought the legal system 
tolerates erroneous convictions the appeals court said but it 
said at some point the judicial system must close old files and 
turn to the future regretfully accepting the risk of error lest 
the quest for perfect justice becomes the enemy of adequate 
justice 
justice department lawyers said even though they agreed with the 
7th circuit court ruling the supreme court should review the matter 
other appeals courts erroneously have made it easier for 
convicted criminals who have completed their sentences to challenge 
their convictions the government said

wildlife officials believe the endangered 
california condor is on the rebound after the hatching of a fourth 
bird bred in captivity 
kaduku whose konkow indian name means very strong being both 
physically and spiritually became the 31st known condor when it 
popped out of its shell sunday at the san diego wild animal park 
without much help from keepers 
the chick weighed in at 58 ounces its aquacolored egg was 
laid on easter 
this is the first time in two decades that there have been 
more than 30 of the birds said park spokesman tom hanscom we 
expect a lot more hatches next year 
all known california condors which are north americas largest 
land birds with wingspans up to 9 feet have been captured in 
hopes of rebuilding their numbers to the point where the species 
can be reintroduced in the wild 
seventeen of the birds are at the wild animal park the 14 
others are at the los angeles zoo 
molloko the first captivebred condor which hatched last year 
remains in good health as do all three chicks produced this year 
hanscom said 
another egg is expected to hatch in about two weeks next years 
mating season more of the condors will have reached sexual 
maturity 
handlers feed the chicks using lifelike condor puppets to keep 
the birds from becoming attached to humans 
the number of the black carrioneaters dwindled dangerously low 
because of shooting and pesticide poisoning

members of atampts largest union voted 
overwhelmingly to authorize a strike if a new contract with the 
telecommunications giant is not reached by saturday union 
officials said today 
the communications workers of america did not release a 
breakdown of the vote authorizing its executive council to call a 
strike with the date to be determined by union president morton 
bahr cwa represents about 130000 american telephone and telegraph 
co employees 
at this stage atampt has yet to seriously address issues of 
concern to our members particularly the issue of employment 
security bahr said in announcing results of the secretballot 
authorization vote 
the international brotherhood of electrical workers which 
represents about 40000 atampt employees is negotiating jointly with 
cwa and is conducting a strike authorization vote 
were united with cwa ibew president john barry said in a 
statement released with the cwa results together our members are 
determined to win jobs with justice and a contract worthy of the 
skills and productivity of our members 
an atampt spokesman said the cwa vote was not surprising and 
expressed hope a strike could be averted 
it is routine for the rankandfile union members to give the 
leadership such authorization spokesman herb linnen said it 
doesnt mean there will be a strike we look forward to a hard 
week a challenging week of bargaining and are still optimistic 
that a settlement can be reached with the unions without a work 
stoppage 
the negotiations began in late march but have stalled over a 
company proposal to shift more health care costs to employees the 
two sides also have significant differences on pay according to 
union officials 
the company was expected to make its formal contract offer to 
the unions early this week the current contracts expire at 1159 
pm edt saturday 
cwa officials have given mixed signals about whether a strike 
would be called immediately if the deadline passed without a new 
contract agreement if the unions and company appear close to an 
agreement the unions likely would extend the deadline by a day or 
two 
even if the two sides remain substantially short of a new 
contract many union leaders believe the unions will not 
immediately strike but instead will implement a plan for a 
nationwide labor boycott of atampt longdistance service a move they 
say will cost the company upwards of 10 million a month 
under this scenario union leaders say they would at first rely 
on the boycott to pressure atampt into concessions and if no 
significant progress was made they then could catch atampt off guard 
with a strike 
indeed a cwa statement today stressed that a strike is only 
one of several tactics to achieve a fair contract 
the boycott plan calls for labor unions and related 
organizations which predominantly are atampt customers to 
temporarily switch their long distance calls to nonunion us sprint 
by using sprints local access number the unions and the aflcio 
also have pledged to urge their major vendors to boycott atampt 
this year is the first time cwa and ibew have negotiated 
jointly three years ago cwa struck atampt for 26 days but the 
company was able to keep half of its manufacturing plants open 
because the ibew agreed to work provided its members were given any 
added benefits cwa won through its strike 
that bitter experience which came in the first contract talks 
after the atampt breakup led to the agreement to negotiate jointly 
this year bahr and barry have promised that their unions will 
stick together in the event of a strike

the supreme court today limited federal 
judges power to exclude potentially prejudicial evidence from 
civil trials ruling against a young pennsylvania man who lost his 
arm in a car wash accident 
the justices by a 63 vote said paul greens productliability 
lawsuit was not denied a fair trial when lawyers representing the 
sued manufacturer were allowed to tell jurors about greens 
criminal record 
writing for the court justice john paul stevens said federal 
rules of evidence require judges to permit impeachment of a civil 
witness with evidence of prior felony convictions regardless of 
ensuant unfair prejudice to the witness or the party offering the 
testimony 
federal judges may exclude evidence only when it is a criminal 
defendant who might be harmed by it stevens said in interpreting a 
particular rule of evidence 
green was 19 when he lost his arm in a june 23 1984 accident 
at the lemoyne minit car wash near harrisburg pa at the time 
green was on workrelease employment from the county prison 
he had reached into a toweldrying machine that his suit alleged 
was defective the machine tore greens right arm completely off at 
the shoulder 
he sued the drying machines manufacturer bock laundry machine 
co 
at trial bocks lawyers were allowed to tell jurors through 
crossexamining green that he had been convicted of several 
felonies including burglary and statutory rape 
greens lawsuit was tried in federal court because bock is not 
based in pennsylvania but in toledo ohio 
a jury ruled for bock and a federal appeals court upheld the 
manufacturers trial victory the appeals court said the trial 
judge had no discretion to exclude such evidence in a civil or 
noncriminal trial 
today the supreme court agreed no error occurred when the 
jury in this productliability suit learned through impeaching 
crossexamination that plantiff green was a convicted felon 
stevens wrote 
justices harry a blackmun william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall dissented 
they said the federal rule of evidence in question should allow 
trial judges to consider the risk of prejudice faced by any 
party not just a criminal defendant 
writing for the three blackmun said this case should have 
been decided on the basis of whether the bock laundry machine co 
designed and sold a dangerously defective machine without providing 
adequate warnings 
the fact that paul green was a convicted felon has little 
if anything to do with the issues we cannot know precisely why 
the jury refused to compensate him for the sad and excruciating 
loss of his arm but there is a very real possibility that it was 
influenced improperly by his criminal record i believe that this 
is not a result congress conceivably could have intended 
the case is green vs bock laundry machine co 871816

jury selection began today in the trial of 
us rep donald lukens on charges he had sex with an underage girl 
the 58yearold republican had no comment as he entered the 
courtroom he has denied the allegation and claimed the girls 
mother tried to extort money from him 
lukens was indicted feb 23 on a misdemeanor charge of 
contributing to the unruliness and delinquency of a child lukens 
who is divorced was accused of having sex with the 16yearold 
girl in his columbus apartment last year 
by midmorning four potential jurors had been questioned about 
their knowledge of the case and whether their opinion had been 
swayed by publicity over the weekend about the trial and a plea 
bargain offered by lukens 
a source said lukens had offered last week to plead guilty if 
references to sexual contact were removed 
if convicted lukens could receive up to six months in jail and 
a 1000 fine 
a columbus tv station on feb 1 broadcast a secretly recorded 
videotape that showed lukens apparently offering a government job 
to the girls mother after she asked him why he was messing 
around with her daughter 
lukens told anna coffman he did not know her daughter was a 
teenager according to the tape made by wsyx at a columbus 
fastfood restaurant 
the fourterm congressman has vowed to serve out his term which 
expires in 1990 
last week a 35yearold sexual molestation case allegedly 
involving lukens was reported by detroit tv station wjbk it 
reported that lukens then a salesman was arrested in michigan in 
1954 on suspicion he had molested a girl 
the station citing unidentified police sources said the case 
was dropped because the childs parents refused to press charges 
lukens said only that there was no case

this community deep in the rugged 
appalachian coal fields wants to use its bloody past to bring in 
tourists 
we can do the same kind of thing that tombstones ariz 
done said mayor johnny fullen whose town this weekend marked 
the anniversary of a fatal 1920 shootout between miners union 
sympathizers and coal company guards 
this town near where west virginia kentucky and virginia meet 
also was in the middle in the late 1800s when the hatfields and the 
mccoys began their feud 
tombstone is known for the gunfight at the ok corral won by 
marshal wyatt earp and his brothers 
what happened here in history wasnt pretty said robert 
mccoy a former mayor and member of the matewan development 
centers board of directors but it was important nationally 
frankly im perplexed as to why this part of history has been 
neglected by the state 
on friday the town of 800 marked the massacre with a talk by 
lon savage author of thunder in the mountains issued a 
walking tour brochure and met with state federal and community 
officials to find ways to preserve the towns past 
this summer two historians from west virginia university will 
spend 10 weeks in matewan taping 50 oral histories and marshall 
universitys center for regional progress will conduct a survey of 
the towns tourism potential 
local officials also are thinking of opening the towns first 
motel 
west virginians should be proud of their history the mayor 
said 
the body count for the 1920 shootout has not been definitively 
settled but estimates place the toll at two miners seven 
detectives and the mayor all killed in a hail of gunfire along the 
railroad tracks behind a hardware store 
nineteen people were indicted none convicted a key figure 
police chief sid twogun hatfield a descendant of clan leader 
anderson devil anse hatfield was gunned down outside the 
courthouse where he was to stand trial 
until recently everyone was sort of secretive about the 
matewan massacre which was the subject of the 1987 movie 
matewan fullen said 
i guess the people involved were still here he said

in the may 7 election 
the opposition which international observers say won the 
election by a 31 margin has been rallying support in this nation 
of 25 million to gain recognition of its claimed victory 
the organization of american states last week approved a 
resolution critical of gen manuel antonio noriega who as head of 
the panamanian defense forces holds real power in panama and 
called for a transfer of power in the shortest possible time 
the noriegacontrolled government nullified the elections the 
opposition has asked the oas to help reverse that order and the 
organization is sending a delegation to panama on tuesday to 
investigate 
ford guillermo endara the opposition presidential candidate 
and vice presidential candidate ricardo arias calderon were greeted 
enthusiastically today at each stop in one of panamas largest 
industrial parks 
today was the third consecutive day the candidates rallied the 
opposition without interference from the government despite its ban 
on marches meetings public demonstrations or caravans of 
vehicles 
the ban lasts until june 5 when the oas delegation is due to 
report back to the organizations headquarters in washington 
on sunday the candidates received raucous applause from 1000 
worshipers at a church 20 miles west of panama city 
on saturday the three made their first campaignstyle 
appearances since they were assaulted by noriegas paramilitary 
forces on may 10 touring a series of marketplaces in and near the 
capital 
that tour was the oppositions first attempt to rally against 
noriega since wednesday when a general strike fizzled

in panama on tuesday to try to promote a resolution of the crisis

president bush that declared the election fraudulent and endara the 
winner was in town to visit us troops and confer with officials

be welcome 
bush is not interested in punishing the pdf murtha said 
he is interested in dealing with the pdf the target of our 
dismay is the leader of the pdf 
noriega was indicted on drug trafficking charges in the united 
states in february 1988 but has withstood all efforts by washington 
to have him removed 
he denies the charges and says they are part of a us plot to 
renege on its treaty to turn the panama canal over to panama at the 
end of 1999

the supreme court today made deadlines for the 
filing of civil rights lawsuits by some prison inmates more 
flexible 
the court unanimously ruled in a case from michigan that states 
may give prisoners extra leeway on when they file such federal 
suits 
the justices reinstated a suit by tyrone victor hardin who said 
his rights were violated when for six months in 1980 and 1981 he 
was placed in solitary confinement at southern michigan state 
prison hardin said he became aware in july 1984 that prison rules 
entitled him to an administrative hearing before he was placed in 
solitary 
hardin representing himself filed a federal suit in 1986 but 
the judge threw out the case on the ground that michigan requires 
such a suit be filed within three years of the alleged injury 
the supreme court said today the judge also should have applied 
a michigan law which suspends the deadline for prisoners the law 
permits a suit to be filed within a year after the inmate is 
released 
justice john paul stevens in his opinion for the high court 
said suspending the deadline for inmates may be intended to help 
prisoneers loathe to bring suit against adversaries to whose 
daily supervision and control they remain subject 
stevens also said inmates as long as they remain confined may 
have great difficulty proving allegations that their rights were 
violated 
a states decision to suspend the deadline for filing suit in 
such cases is consistent with federal civil rights law aimed at 
protecting prisoners he said 
the case is hardin vs straub 877023

the supreme court today refused to shield the 
rev sun myung moons unification church from being sued by two 
former members who say they were duped into joining it 
the court also turned down an appeal by mass murderer john wayne 
gacy convicted and sentenced to death in 1980 for killing 33 boys 
and young men 
the court without comment rejected arguments that religious 
freedom protects the church against allegations of brainwashing 
and fraudulent recruiting 
david molko and tracy leal told similar stories in court papers 
of how they became moonies in california and how 
deprogramming led them to quit 
molko was 27 when he graduated from temple university law school 
in 1978 and decided to visit san francisco 
soon after arriving there in 1979 he was approached by two men 
at a bus stop who told him they belonged to an international 
community of socially conscious people 
molko went to dinner with them and later joined a group that 
went to a farm outside the city he said that in the ensuing days 
he and others at the retreat were kept to a tight schedule of 
lectures group discussions and calisthenics 
he said he had no time to himself and at least at the outset 
even was accompanied to the bathroom by a group member 
molko said he asked group members several times whether the 
organization was a religious one and was told it was not it was 
not until the 12th day after the group arrived at another retreat 
called camp k that he was told the group was part of the 
unification church he said 
molko said he was confused and angry but decided to stay on when 
members convinced him that deception had been necessary because of 
the churchs negative reputation 
ms leal was a 19yearold college student when a recruiter 
approached her at a san francisco bus station in 1979 
she said she was not told the group was part of the unification 
church until her 22nd day at the retreat 
ms leal and molko remained church members for several months 
before they were abducted by deprogrammers who had been hired 
by their parents 
they are suing the church for punitive damages for the emotional 
distress they say they suffered molko also is seeking the return 
of 6000 he donated to the church 
the california supreme court voting 61 last october overruled 
two lower courts and reinstated the suits it ordered jury trials 
molko and leal contend that by the time the church 
disclosed its true identity the churchs agents had rendered them 
incapable of deciding not to join the state court said they 
contend in other words that the church deceived them into a 
setting in which they could be brainwashed 
the state court said the former members are entitled to their 
day in court to prove their charges even though no physical force 
was involved in the alleged brainwashing 
the state court rejected arguments that forcing the church to 
defend itself against fraud allegations interferes with its right 
to practice its religion freely 
at most it potentially closes one questionable avenue for 
bringing new members into the church the state court said 
the national council of churches other religious organizations 
and a group consisting primarily of college professors urged the 
justices to overrule the state court 
they said the state court ruling has had and will continue to 
have a serious chilling effect on religious proselytizing and 
conversion in california and elsewhere 
in the gacy case the justices rejected arguments that illinois 
death penalty law wrongly gives county prosecutors complete and 
unguided discretion to determine whether to seek the death penalty 
in murder cases 
gacys appeal also had contended that he was denied a fair trial 
because the presiding judge limited the testimony of an expert 
psychiatric witness for the defense 
in other action the court 
limited federal judges power to exclude potentially 
prejudicial evidence from civil trials ruling against a young 
pennsylvania man who lost his arm in a car wash accident 
the justices by a 63 vote said paul greens productliability 
lawsuit was not denied a fair trial when lawyers representing the 
sued manufacturer were allowed to tell jurors about greens 
criminal record 
agreed to study a federal regulation aimed at saving the 
government time and money when it mistakenly overpays some social 
security recipients 
the court said it will study a ruling in a colorado case that 
struck down the regulation 
refused to shield chicago from being sued for monetary damages 
in state court for allegedly allowing excessive noise and air 
pollution at ohare international airport 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that court 
allow such lawsuits 
rejected an appeal by a former chicago councilman convicted of 
fraud for illegally conspiring to buy and sell taxdelinquent 
properties 
the court over one dissenting vote refused to use the case of 
thomas e keane to set guidelines on when some people may challenge 
their fraud convictions after completing prison terms for those 
convictions 
ruled that a lawsuit stemming from the terrorist hijacking of 
the cruise ship achille lauro in 1985 may be tried in a federal 
court in new york city 
voting 90 the justices rejected an appeal by the ship owners 
aimed at transferring the suit to a court in naples italy

the supreme court ruled today that a lawsuit

lauro in 1985 may be tried in a federal court in new york city 
voting 90 the justices rejected an appeal by the ship owners 
aimed at transferring the suit to a court in naples italy 
palestine liberation organization terrorists seized control of 
the ship in october 1985 while it was cruising in the mediterranean 
sea 
leon klinghoffer 69 of new york was killed by the hijackers 
and thrown overboard klinghoffer who was jewish had been 
paralyzed on his right side by a stroke several years earlier and 
was in a wheelchair 
a number of american passengers including klinghoffers wife 
marilyn sued lauro lines in federal court in new york city 
mrs klinghoffer died in 1986 and the couples daughters ilsa 
and lisa settled privately with lauro lines but the claims by 
others in the suit still are pending 
the italian shipowning company said american courts lack 
authority over the suit because of a provision on the passenger 
tickets that said any such claims must be filed in an italian court 
a federal judge in new york city said the lengthy and intricate 
instructions on the ticket in small print did not give the 
passengers reasonable notice they were barred from suing in this 
country 
the supreme court today said whatever the merits of that issue 
the lawsuit first must go to trial in the united states 
justice william j brennan writing for the court said if lauro 
lines loses the suit it will have an opportunity then to appeal on 
grounds that american courts lacked jurisdiction 
lauro lines does not have the right now to appeal on that issue 
brennan said 
the case is lauro lines vs chasser 8823

us ambassador edward 
perkins ending his tour of duty in south africa today said he 
remains encouraged by the determination of the black majority to be 
free despite goverment suppression 
i think that probably is the most encouraging because it tells 
me that its pretty difficult to stifle the desire of people to be 
free perkins told an airport news conference as he concluded 2 
years as the first black us ambassador to south africa 
perkins 60 said the most disappointing events of his tenure 
were the continuation of the governments state of emergency to 
control antiapartheid protests the banning of 17 activist groups 
and the large numbers of people who are arrested and held without 
charge under the governments emergency powers 
perkins was a strong critic of such developments during his 
tenure although the embassy repeatedly condemned restrictions on 
the press perkins gave no ontherecord interviews during his 
tenure until last week when he talked to two south african 
newspapers 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
stateofemergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict 
reporting about unrest security force actions treatment of 
detainees some forms of protest and a broad range of statements 
the government considers subversive enforcement of the regulations 
has not been comprehensive 
perkins said south africa is moving through a transition to a 
different kind of country to one where the majority population 
will have a decisive say in how they are governed to a south 
africa in which the majority will participate in and benefit from 
the wealth of its economy 
perkins has been appointed directorgeneral of the foreign 
service which is subject to senate confirmation

on the second approach the plane struck electric transmission 
lines owned and maintained by san diego gas and electric no one 
survived the resulting crash 
mrs finley first sued san diego and the utility in state court 
she contended that the city negligently had failed to maintain the 
runway approach lights and that the utility negligently had placed 
its lines too close to the runway and failed to provide warning 
beacons for them 
when she later discovered that the federal aviation 
administration was responsible for the runway lights mrs finley 
sued the government in federal court under the ftca 
she then asked a federal trial judge to add san diego and the 
utility company as defendants in the federal case 
the trial judge granted the request citing judicial economy 
and efficiency 
but the 9th us circuit court of appeals last year reversed the 
trial judge ruling that the city and utility could not be included 
as defendants in the federal case 
today the supreme court said in an opinion by justice antonin 
scalia that the appeals court was right 
but justices harry a blackmun john paul stevens william j 
brennan and thurgood marshall dissented 
the decision apparently leaves mrs finley free to pursue her 
state court suit against the city and the utility while suing the 
federal government in federal court 
the case is finely vs us 871973

india demonstrated its ballistic missile 
capability today by successfully testfiring its first 
mediumrange surfacetosurface missile into the bay of bengal 
officials said 
the missile was fired from the seaside launch site at chandipur 
750 miles southeast of new delhi united news of india said 
the 75ton missile has a range capability of about 1500 miles 
sufficient to hit targets as far away as iran hong kong china and 
islands near the equator to the south western military officials 
said 
it can also hit any target in neighboring pakistan india and 
pakistan have fought three wars in the past 42 years 
defense experts say the missiles oneton payload capability is 
more than enough to carry a nuclear warhead 
the test firing was indias third attempt at launching the agni 
missile whose name means fire in the ancient sanskrit language 
agni is not a weapons system prime minister rajiv gandhi 
said in a statement issued after the launch however the 
technologies proved in agni are deeply significant for evolving 
national security options 
he said the missile accurately followed the predetermined 
flight path and fully met the objectives we had set for it 
gandhi did not say how far the agni traveled during its first 
testfiring and defense officials declined to comment on the 
matter 
the missiles first firing scheduled for april 20 was 
postponed by lastminute problems with the ignition system a 
second launch set for may 1 was canceled after an error in one of 
the rockets subsystems 
by successfully firing the missile india joined the united 
states the soviet union china france and britain in ballistic 
missile capability 
in washington white house spokesman roman popadiuk criticized 
the test 
on todays test were very concerned he said and in the 
past weve made our position very clear to the indian government 
that further proliferation of ballistic missiles in south asia 
would be regarded as a highly destabilizing development in the 
region popadiuk said he did not know if us officials had 
communicated with the indians on this test 
united news of india said 11000 people living in 13 villages 
near the launch site were evacuated from their homes sunday evening 
as a security measure the villagers have protested the testfiring 
for fear the government would force them to relocate permanently if 
more launches are held at chandipur 
britain indias colonia ruler first used the site in 1893 to 
test ammunition the indians turned it into a missile test range in 
1986 because of an unusual feature it faced the bay of bengal and 
during low tide the sea recedes up to two miles enabling faster 
and easier recovery of shells and other shortrange projectiles 
the bay also has light commercial and naval traffic 
india has said it intends to use its nuclear capacity only for 
peaceful purposes 
western military experts in new delhi questioned the stance from 
a military standpoint however 
you need accuracy or a point target if you are using a 
conventional warhead said one western analyst speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
but if you are using a nuclear warhead the exact target does 
not matter he said i am not saying that the indians are going 
to use a nuclear warhead but the question is why not 
india exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago and western 
nuclear experts believe that scientists can assemble an atomic 
weapon in one week 
india says its nuclear program is intended for nonmilitary 
purposes such as generating power the test firing of the 
intermediaterange ballistic missile or irbm was only a 
technology demonstration of the countrys capabilities according 
to the government 
india previously testfired three surfacetosurface and 
surfacetoair missiles with ranges of about 20 miles to 150 miles

president bush is encouraging demonstrators in 
china to stand up for what you believe and urging the communist 
authorities to exercise restraint saying he hopes prodemocracy 
protests do not result in bloodshed 
bush will discuss the china situation tuesday in a meeting with 
wan li president of chinas national peoples congress who is 
visiting washington li was meeting today with vice president dan 
quayle 
bush who once headed the us liaison office in china and li 
were scheduled to play tennis on tuesday as well but the 
recreational interlude was canceled as inappropriate given the 
current unrest in china white house spokesman roman popadiuk said 
today 
he said bushs national security advisers are keeping him 
abreast of the situation 
i would urge the government to be as forthcoming as possible 
in order to see more democratization and to see a peaceful 
resolution of this matter bush said sunday 
we do support freedom of speech freedom of assembly freedom 
of the press and clearly we support democracy the president said 
at a news conference in boston with french president francois 
mitterrand 
the two leaders received honorary degrees and delivered 
commencement remarks at boston university afterward bush returned 
to the white house and mitterrand flew to paris 
bushs comments came as prodemocracy students occupied 
tiananmen square in beijing in violation of martial law for a third 
day despite repeated rumors of an imminent military crackdown the 
chinese army had not moved to evict the protesters 
bush who served as us envoy to china in 19741975 said i 
think this perhaps is a time for caution because we aspire to see 
the chinese people have democracy 
he said he did not want to exhort in a way that is going to 
stir up a military confrontation bush said it would not be 
appropriate for the leader of the united states to tell the 
demonstrators exactly what their course of action should be 
however he said he hoped the students would follow a peaceful 
course and continue to fight for what you believe in stand up 
for what you believe in but beyond that i cannot go 
former secretary of state henry a kissinger and other us 
experts on sunday endorsed the moderate course pursued by the bush 
administration 
emphasizing hopes for avoiding bloodshed bush said we revere 
the model of martin luther king in this country for his peaceful 
protest and so i might suggest a familiarization with that for the 
people in china 
king an apostle of nonviolence led the civil rights movement 
in the united states in the 1950s and 1960s he was assassinated in 
1968 in memphis where he was lending support to a garbage workers 
strike 
i dont want to be gratuitous in giving advice bush said 
but i would encourage restraint i do not want to see bloodshed 
he said it would be sound advice for students and workers to 
adopt peaceful means of effecting change 
i think that the president is saying just about all that can 
be said kissinger said on the abctv program this week with 
david brinkley 
we do not want to incite to riot partly because the 
consequences are unforeseeable in human terms but also partly in 
terms of hardheaded american foreign interest said kissinger 
stressing that anarchy in china would be bad for america 
from a foreign policy point of view we americans ought to 
consider that if china leaves the game for a while because of 
domestic turmoil it increases soviet freedom of maneuver to a 
remarkable extent he said 
winston lord us ambassador to beijing in the reagan 
administration said bush administration officials were appealing 
to the authorities for restraint and they have made clear they 
are on the side of the students and political reforms he spoke 
on the nbctv program meet the press 
during his news conference with mitterand bush also expressed 
optimism that a rift within nato over shortrange european missiles 
could be bridged before next weeks summit of alliance leaders 
west germany wants negotiations with the soviet union to reduce 
shortrange nuclear weapons in the european theater a step the 
united states opposes 
bush said he has been working behind the scenes to reach a 
consensus and added i think we could well have this resolved 
before the summit

richard secord pleaded innocent today to 
charges of concealing from congress more than 1 million in profits 
he allegedly pocketed by selling arms to iran and the nicaraguan 
contras 
prosecutors and defense attorneys said at secords arraignment 
before us district court chief judge aubrey robinson that they 
will discuss whether to combine the latest set of charges with an 
earlier indictment a hearing on the question will be held may 31 
secord was released on his own recognizance 
the latest indictment nine counts unsealed may 11 after the 
conclusion of oliver norths criminal trial accuses secord of 
obstructing the congressional irancontra investigation in 1987 
perjury and making a false statement 
secords lawyer thomas green said he might have to withdraw 
from the case because i was privy to and was a party to 
discussions with congress in connection with secords 1987 
congressional testimony therefore green might be called as a 
witness at the trial he said 
green said he would under those circumstances withdraw from 
the case in favor of a partner in his law firm james e sharp who 
stood next to secord as he was arraigned prosecutor reid 
weingarten said that usually the entire firm is dismissed as 
the attorney for a defendant when one of the firms lawyers becomes 
a witness in the case weingarten said we must explore 
propriety of the firm of sharp green amp lankford representing 
secord 
secord pleaded innocent last year to six other criminal charges 
in an indictment accusing him and three others of illegally 
diverting more than 14 million in us iran arms sale proceeds to 
the nicaraguan rebels 
charged with the former air force major general in that 1988 
indictment were business partner albert hakim former national 
security adviser john poindexter and former national security 
council aide north conspiracy and theft charges against north 
relating to the diversion were dropped before his trial the former 
nsc aide was convicted earlier this month of three criminal charges 
in the irancontra scandal 
north enlisted secord in 1984 to run weapons secretly to the 
contras during a congressional cutoff in military aid to the rebel 
force 
secord and hakim carried out their work for north and the reagan 
administration through a network of offshore companies and swiss 
bank accounts dubbed the enterprise 
secord is accused of lying when he told congress that he wasnt 
taking profits from the enterprise in fact said the federal grand 
jury indictment secord used a former internal revenue service 
lawyer on a continuous basis to manage over a million dollars of 
profits allocated to the defendant richard v secord 
he also was accused of lying when he told congress that 
his only financial gain from the arms sales to the contras and 
iran was his 6000amonth salary 
half a million dollars from the enterprise funneled to one of 
his companies in virginia was a loan 
he was unaware any money from the enterprise benefited north 
who was convicted of illegally accepting a 13800 home security 
system from secord in addition the government alleges secord and 
hakim arranged to set aside 200000 as a death benefit for the 
education of norths children

president corazon aquinos response 
to ferdinand marcos latest health crisis belies her claims of a 
stable government and shows the nervousness with which she still 
views her ousted predecessor 
mrs aquino said today her government is not strong enough to 
risk the return of marcos and that even his funeral could cause 
trouble 
she refused on friday to allow the ailing 71yearold deposed 
president to return from hawaiian exile and die in his homeland 
she also refused to allow him to be buried here 
but her national security adviser and a senator closely 
identified with the administration indicated today the government 
might allow a marcos burial if his followers guarantee there would 
be no bid to undermine the government 
mrs aquinos caution is wellfounded considering marcos 
supporters led some of the six coup attempts wthat rocked her first 
two years in power 
but since a bloody august 1987 attempt the government has 
boasted continually of its stability pointing to two years of 
economic growth rates above 5 percent and numerous surveys showing 
mrs aquinos popularity 
government and military spokesmen claim communist rebels are 
losing strength and marcos following has been reduced to a few 
thousand fanatics 
marcos is no longer viewed by many filipinos as a threat to 
the aquino government wrote aquino critic ninez cachoolivares 
in the filipino publication businessworld few believe that he or 
his wife is capable of making a political comeback 
few challenge mrs aquinos decision to prevent marcos coming 
back alive 
but in a society that tends to forget its leaders past 
indiscretions preventing a former president from being buried in 
his homeland has struck many as shortsighted and vindictive 
one would hate to think too that mrs aquino would be so 
stubbornly uncharitable as to turn down a dying mans last request 
even if as she probably believes the man was the single biggest 
cause of her widowhood said the newspaper malaya which strongly 
opposed marcos 
mrs aquinos husband benigno aquino jr was slain at manila 
airport in 1983 moments after returning from the united states to 
challenge marcos 
after a cabinet meeting to discuss the affair today mrs aquino 
told reporters she feared marcos followers would exploit the death 
of the man who ruled longer than any philippine president much as 
her own supporters used her husbands murder for political gain 
lets say a person has been ill for 20 years and now after 
three years he is slowly recovering mrs aquino said just 
because he is growing stronger does not mean you are going to 
expose him to infection 
commentator luis beltran wrote in the manila standard it is a 
nowin situation for president aquino and her government if she 
keeps to her frequent statements that her government is stable and 
beyond the reach of coups detat she has no choice but to allow 
marcos and his family to come home 
national security adviser rafael ileto told reporters today 
there was a chance the government might reconsider a marcos burial 
i dont think that issue of forever refusing him is valid 
ileto said it could change 
sen aquilino pimentel said the government might allow a burial 
in marcos ilocos norte home province if the family pledged that 
they will not use his remains as political capital like parading 
him around manila 
marcos evokes deep and often contradictory emotions in an asian 
society that respects authority but harbors bitter memories of 
eight years of martial rule 
on friday amid reports marcos might die at any time news 
organizations were flooded with calls from bankers officials and 
ordinary filipinos asking if he was dead 
government officials have said privately the administration 
could face the specter of counterdemonstrations by both 
antimarcos leftists and promarcos rightists if his body were 
returned 
that would encourage opposition from the left and right and 
discourage foreign investors 
already questions have been raised about the stability of the 
aquino administration in the wake of the april 21 assassination 
here of us army col james nick rowe by communist rebels 
as a sign of uncertainty share prices dropped 18 points friday 
because of the rumor marcos already had died business sources said 
banks were quietly buying up dollars for fear marcos death would 
trigger unrest and depress the philippine peso 
selling stocks and buying dollars was a normal response to a 
looming political crisis one analyst said on condition of 
anonymity

floridas supreme court today said 
minors are free to get abortions without an adults consent at 
least until next month 
that is when the court will hear arguments challenging the 
constitutionality of a 1988 florida law requiring single girls 
under 18 to get permission from parents a guardian or judge before 
getting abortions 
the case involving a 15yearold girl had gone all the way to 
the us supreme court which refused to order enforcement of the 
law last week 
the law had previously been struck down as unconstitutional by a 
state appeals court the state attorney generals office had asked 
the state supreme court to allow the law to be enforced until the 
justices take up the matter 
but today the supreme court refused without comment however 
the court agreed to speed up a hearing on the law from september 
to june 27 
with todays ruling it is our opinion that the law is 
unenforceable statewide said assistant deputy attorney general 
mitch franks 
the us supreme court had refused without comment thursday to 
reinstate floridas abortion consent law 
some experts said at the time that the justices had cleared the 
way for all florida minors to get abortions without permission but 
the attorney generals office said that the ruling might apply to 
only one of floridas five appellate districts 
after the us supreme court ruling the girls attorney jerri 
blair refused to say whether her client who was 12 weeks pregnant 
and is identified only as tw had obtained an abortion

the environmental movement in the united states is booming as a 
steady tide of bad news about the environment culminating with the 
alaska oil spill has brought a surge of support to the nations 
leading conservation groups 
in the past year officials of these groups say contributions 
to the national audubon society rose 50 percent the rate of 
membership growth at the wilderness society doubled and the 
national wildlife federation added 700000 new members 
were in the ironic situation where possibly the nations 
greatest environmental catastrophe ever is causing this increased 
interest in environmental organizations audubon spokesman robert 
sangeorge said its a paradox 
although the march 24 oil spill is the most dramatic of the 
recent events fueling the movements growth it is not the only 
one environmentalists also cite last summers east coast beach 
pollution and reports suggesting that air pollution is changing the 
earths climate 
the oil spill said fred krupp executive director of the 
environmental defense fund has been an important event in a 
series of important events that have heightened public interest 
although the environmentalists insist they arent gloating over 
exxons misfortune they also cant hide a sense of vindication 
this spill has just really presented an opportunity said 
lee keller reis a spokeswoman for the national wildlife 
federation you hate to say we told you so but its a way to 
make a point 
it is also a way to raise money several groups were quick to 
take advantage of the spill by sending out direct mail appeals for 
contributions 
the national wildlife federation the nations largest 
environmental group with more than 58 million members established 
an alaska fund immediately after the disaster and asked members for 
contributions 
so far 400000 has been collected ms reis said she said the 
fund will pay for research on the effects of the spill and for 
lobbying against oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife 
refuge among other things 
a mailing sent out by the defenders of wildlife was that 
organizations most successful ever according to carol waite the 
groups development director 
defenders of wildlife which has 80000 members got 200000 in 
response to the plea ms waite said one woman sent in an 
unsolicited donation of about 1000 in exxon stock 
i think that was just indicative of how angry people are over 
this devastation ms waite said 
another group the 285000member wilderness society hasnt 
sent out an appeal for contributions related to the oil spill but 
has received about 50000 in unsolicited funds according to 
rebecca wodder vice president for membership and development 
other groups such as the national audubon society said it was 
too early to assess the impact of the oil spill on membership or 
contributions audubon hasnt yet gauged the response to a plea for 
funds that it recently sent to 320000 households around the 
nation sangeorge said 
greenpeace estimates that it has been adding members at a rate 
of 50000 a month since autumn and now has 135 million members 
the environmental defense funds membership has more than doubled 
in the last 18 months and now stands at more than 100000 
according to krupp 
but krupp and some of his colleagues are wary of the apparent 
change in public attitude 
the fundamental lesson of environmental politics is that the 
publics interest in gains doesnt always translate into workable 
solutions krupp said 
for instance he said last summers beach pollution with sewage 
and medical waste prompted legislation that stiffened penalties for 
polluters but did little to reduce the sources of pollution 
the spotlight is now focused on environmental organizations 
krupp said its both a great opportunity and also a challenge 
as environmentalists we need to make sure that this support 
translates into real gains and not just proclamations

the vast majority of americans would accept 
mandatory trash recycling higher electric bills and other 
inconveniences to help clean up the environment a national poll 
has found 
broad perceptions exist that pollution is on the rise the media 
general and associated press survey also found backing for 
initiatives ranging from a ban on household aerosol products to 
strict emission controls at power plants 
threequarters of the 1084 respondents said laws against 
pollution in the united states are too weak and about as many 
faulted efforts by government businesses and average americans to 
keep the environment clean 
environmental concerns were heightened by the 10 million gallon 
exxon valdez oil spill in march in prince william sound alaska 
but the poll conducted by telephone from may 513 found concern 
and support for action beyond oil tanker safety among other steps 
majorities favored urgent government action no matter what 
the cost to clean up toxic waste and protect drinking water 
eightyone percent said new safety rules and emergency cleanup 
teams should be in place at all major oil facilities even if the 
expense would raise the price of oil and gasoline 
seventytwo percent favored strict smokestack controls at 
oiland coalburning power plants even if that would hike the 
price of electricity 
most respondents also supported restrictions on their own 
behavior twenty percent said their communities now require them to 
separate and recycle household trash of the rest 87 percent said 
they would support such a requirement 
similarly 75 percent said they would back a ban on household 
aerosol products whose propellants can pollute the air 60 percent 
supported a ban on charcoal lighter fluid and 58 percent favored a 
ban on nonradial tires which release more rubber into the air 
than do radials 
bans on aerosol cans lighter fluid and nonradial tires are 
among the measures suggested for southern california by a regional 
air quality board in march other steps in that proposal won less 
support nationally respondents were split on parking restrictions 
in cities to discourage driving and 59 percent opposed banning 
gasolinefueled garden appliances 
overall 72 percent said pollution appears to have increased in 
the past decade nearly a quarter said they stayed away from the 
beach last year because of beach pollution 
concerns about the environment crossed ideological and political 
lines residents of the nations most densely populated areas were 
the most apt to see antipollution efforts as inadequate and to 
favor new steps 
respondents indicated there was plenty of blame to go around 
fortytwo percent said businesses are doing a poor job of keeping 
the environment clean and 36 percent said only fair for a 
negative rating of 78 percent 
similarly 83 percent rated the federal governments 
environmental record as fair or poor as opposed to good or 
excellent 71 percent gave a negative rating to their state and 
local governments environmental records and 79 percent said most 
americans are doing only a fair or poor job of keeping the 
environment clean 
the highest environmental priority was toxic waste disposal in 
which 63 percent supported urgent government action regardless of 
the expense next was the related issue of pollution of the 
nations drinking water with 52 percent favoring urgent action 
cost aside 
for those and other environmental problems the poll gave the 
choices of urgent government action no matter what the cost 
prompt government action limited government action or no 
government action urgent or prompt action were favored 
overwhelmingly by 72 percent or more in every instance 
responses were split on one current issue whether the federal 
government should issue new offshore oil drilling permits 
fortyfive percent opposed new drilling off the coasts of 
california and florida while about 35 percent favored new drilling 
there and 20 percent were unsure 
opposition was greater to oil drilling in the arctic national 
wildlife refuge in alaska sixty percent were opposed and only 
about a quarter were in favor with the rest unsure 
the poll which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points 
was conducted by the ap and media general inc a communications 
company based in richmond va that publishes the richmond 
timesdispatch the richmond news leader the tampa fla tribune

about 2500 miners from belgiums last 
two coal pits demonstrated monday against plans to close the mines 
ahead of schedule 
the peaceful march contrasted sharply with last months 
demonstration in the northeastern mining region of limburg when 
police had to fire shots in the air to keep the miners at bay 
twentyeight police were injured 
the management of the coal mines wants the pits closed before 
the scheduled date of 1996 arguing that government subsidies to 
keep them open can be better used to create reconversion industries 
the regional government of flanders is to discuss the issue 
friday 
miners want to keep production going as long as possible an 
early closure also would endanger their benefits 
two years ago management closed three mines and cut the 
workforce of 18000 in half

cruising for democracy has come to china 
the onemonth old movement for more personal freedom and clean 
government has involved hundreds of thousands of students workers 
and journalists now theyve been joined by bikers 
a pack of motorcycle riders has been roaring up and down central 
beijings main streets the past week in support of students fasting 
in central tiananmen square for democracy 
the beijing branch of the wild bunch kicked into gear with 
about 75 motorcyclists and grew to nearly 400 by saturday when 
students in the square were expecting the army would try to force 
them out 
many of the people who brought gauze and surgical masks saturday 
night as a precaution against tear gas wound up covering up for 
protection from the plumes of exhaust from the cycles 
several cyclists rode with their fashionably dressed girlfriends 
perched on the back they waved chinese national flags and banners 
with anticorruption slogans as they sped by at least one swilled 
beer as he careened around the square 
the cyclists seemed to have the most fun late at night roaring 
down the avenue in front of zhongnanhai the compound where the 
countrys leaders work and live honking horns and revving motors 
to make sure their presence was known

students protesting for democracy have shown a fondness for 
bureaucracy and the trappings of power two things they supposedly 
are fighting 
for much of the past week one could barely walk through the 
studentoccupied tiananmen square for more than a minute without 
being told the territory that lay ahead was out of bounds 
you cant go in there was a familiar refrain from countless 
students armed with nothing more than an air of selfimportance 
student leaders issued passes to some reporters that supposedly 
allowed access around the square but even they were met with the 
response im sorry but those passes are temporarily 
ineffective 
meanwhile other students waved flags blew whistles displayed 
impressive hand signals and constantly barked orders in trying to 
direct the chaotic traffic in central beijing created by the 
tiananmen protest despite their best efforts however traffic 
remained impossible

soldiers deployed in the outskirts have spent much of the past 
few days meeting the citizens of beijing who have swarmed around 
the military convoys to prevent them from taking action against 
protesting students 
the people and the military generally appear to get along 
the people have offered the soldiers popsicles and squash to 
eat newspapers to read and lectures on democracy to mull over 
the troops in return have chatted with the masses and 
entertained them with an occassional song 
one revolutionary blast from the past sung by troops to hearty 
applause was learn from comrade lei feng the song is a tribute 
to a perhaps mythical soldier offered for emulation years ago as a 
keen student of mao tsetungs works comrade lei so the story 
goes died when he was beaned by a falling telephone pole

the communist party leader of shanghai has 
acknowledged he was too rash in firing a popular daring newspaper 
editor whose dismissal angered journalists nationwide 
the china womens news said jiang zemin welcomed everyones 
criticism but also denied reports that he was criticized by the 
national partys central committee 
jiang did not say if he was willing to reinstate qin benli 
editor in chief of the weekly world economic herald 
china womens news carried jiangs comments in its friday 
edition which was not delivered until monday 
mass protests in beijing against the governments hardline 
attitude toward student demonstrators have disrupted delivery of 
mail and newspapers some newspapers also have missed editions 
since premier li peng declared martial law saturday 
shanghai authorities fired qin after he refused to alter the 
papers april 24 edition and accused him of repeated violations 
of discipline 
the edition contained calls for a reassessment of party chief hu 
yaobang whose death april 15 triggered student protests that led 
to the mass marches hu was ousted in 1987 for failing to crack 
down on earlier student protests 
after dismissing qin shanghai authorities set up a special 
committee to rectify and supervise the paper however its 
lowerlevel editors and reporters have continued to express 
defiance and try to publish controversial articles and officials 
have halted and revised two editions since 
qins dismissal prompted journalists in beijing and shanghai to 
join the student protests more than 1000 beijing reporters signed 
a petition demanding a dialogue on censorship and thousands 
marched last week in beijing and shanghai 
it is the first time journalists for the tightly controlled 
official media many of whom are party members have rebelled 
openly and in such large numbers 
they said they were embarrassed that many chinese had to get 
news on events in their own country from foreign shortwave radio 
broadcasts such as the voice of america and the bbc 
li datong an editor at the china youth news who organized the 
beijing reporters petition said he thought it was possible qin 
could be reinstated if enough people kept pressuring shanghai 
officials 
chinese sources said last week that jiang offered to reinstate 
qin if he wrote a selfcriticism of his actions and the herald 
agreed not to attack jiang or the shanghai city government the 
paper refused

israels decision to expel thousands of 
palestinian workers could cause financial hardship for their 
families in the occupied lands and harm the businesses that 
employed them 
about 50000 workers from the gaza strip were ordered home last 
week many hold lowpaying jobs in construction textiles 
restaurants street cleaning and garbage collection 
israeli officials say workers from gaza will be allowed to 
return only with special permits and the system probably will be 
applied later to the 60000 workers from the west bank 
government officials said the purpose was to punish palestinians 
for the 17monthold uprising against israeli rule 
criiticism came from within the government and from liberal 
legislators 
shimon peres finance minister and deputy prime minister told 
israel radio expelling workers would cause economic problems for 
palestinians that would inflame the uprising 
we are pushing them into a corner from which there will be 
more bitterness and resistance he said 
worried businessmen say their industries will suffer unless 
replacements are found quickly and have appealed for permission to 
hire workers abroad 
palestinians expressed concern that delays in issuing the new 
permits might cost them their jobs fawaz abu sitteh an economist 
from gaza city described the action as the ugliest means of 
collective punishment 
annual per capita income in gaza is equivalent to less than 750 
and people have little in savings he said 
they depend on daily work the economist said they cannot 
finance themselves if they dont work 
the 110000 palestinians who work in israel are breadwinners for 
many of the 17 million who live in the territories bringing home 
an estimated 700 million a year they will find few jobs at home 
because little industrial development has taken place during 22 
years of israeli occupation 
a study in 1988 by the west bank data base project accused 
israel of a deliberate and consistent policy aimed at keeping the 
territories as a dumping ground for israeli industrial products and 
as a pool of cheap labor 
those who run industries dependent on unskilled palestinian 
workers say they will have trouble finding replacements because 
israelis do not want the jobs 
dov pollak managing director of polgat textiles said his 
company had employed about 130 gazans and was hardpressed to find 
substitutes 
aharon sapir director of the construction industrys 
contractors association described the loss of arab workers as 
catastrophic and said the immediate solution is to bring 
foreign workers to replace them 
so far the government has opposed importing workers because 
112000 israelis are unemployed 
defense minister yitzhak rabin made clear the new policies are 
intended to punish the palestinians 
we started two or three months ago to look for measures that 
will make it clear to the palestinians in gaza later on in the 
west bank that the right to leave the territories is a 
privilege he said in an interview 
rabin said there must be a certain balance between their 
freedom to work in israel and their participation in violence and 
terror he has the support of many israelis angered by the 
governments inability to crush the uprising 
one place feelings are especially strong is ashkelon a coastal 
city north of gaza the body of a soldier the government said was 
killed by palestinians was found near ashkelon a missing soldier 
believed kidnapped by palestinians is from the city 
we shouldnt let them work here anymore thy kill our 
children said shmuel attias 57 who has overseen palestinian 
sanitation crews in ashkelon for two decades 
yossi sarid a parliament member from the leftwing citizens 
rights movement described the government action as stupid 
unjust ineffective and immoral 
he accused rabin of playing into the hands of radical israelis 
who want to expel all palestinians 
by sending back the inhabitants of the gaza strip in a way 
which reminds me of south african methods i believe he gives 
legitimacy to all the transferists everywhere sarid said

popular movements in the baltic republics are 
going too far in demanding greater independence and backing 
programs that amount to complete secession from the soviet union 
the communist party newspaper pravda said monday 
grassroots groups in estonia latvia and lithuania are issuing 
demands that are extremist and even nationalist the newspaper said 
referring to resolutions passed at a midmay assembly of baltic 
popular movements in estonia pravda said in total although no 
one talks about this directly they make sense only if their 
authors have in mind the complete secession of the three republics 
from the soviet union 
the baltic assembly stopped short of endorsing secession but 
many members of the estonian and latvian peoples fronts and the 
lithuanian movement sajudis openly espouse complete secession 
the pravda article came three days before the opening of a new 
national parliament at which at least one baltic delegation the 
lithuanians have threatened to walk out if their desires are 
ignored 
we think uzbeks or russians dont understand our problems 
said alfredas smailys a lithuanian delegate to the new congress of 
peoples deputies from kaunas we demand the right of veto if 
however our protest is not taken into account were prepared to 
leave the hall 
a deputy from estonia ulo vooglaid would not specify what 
tactics the estonians will use but he said the delegation will 
not retreat from the platform worked out at the baltic assembly 
baltic nationalists issued a call may 14 for economic 
independence from moscow by next year sixtyone deputies who 
belong to the popular movements also hammered out a joint platform 
asserting the right of the countrys 15 republics to set their own 
policies 
last week the baltic popular movements saw some of their 
economic proposals approved by the estonian and lithuanian 
parliaments 
they passed measures taking virtually all control over local 
industry away from moscow as of 1990 lithuanias economic law 
includes provision for printing its own money and estonias would 
allow limited private property 
lithuania on thurday also duplicated estonias declaration of 
sovereignty and claimed veto power over soviet laws on its 
territory 
moscow proclaimed estonias sovereignty law was invalid last 
fall but estonia still considers it in force and neither side has 
forced a showdown

the movement for political change grew from a 
tiny student poster campaign to a mass call for the removal of top 
chinese leaders in five weeks of unprecedented high drama 
chinas leadership could hardly have seen the trouble awaiting 
them when former communist party chief hu yaobang a relatively 
liberal leader who was ousted in a crackdown on a previous round of 
student demonstrations died of a heart attack april 15 
within hours of hus death posters sprang up at beijing 
university praising him and indirectly criticing the leaders who 
forced him to resign two years earlier the students held several 
demonstrations during the following week to press demands for 
democratic reform a free press and clean government 
events surrounding hus april 22 funeral set the tone for the 
following month of protest with students fearlessly defying 
security forces 
up to 100000 people gathered in central beijings tiananmen 
square april 21 to mourn hu and stayed overnight refusing to 
follow police orders to disperse 
top officials going to a memorial for hu the following day at 
the adjacent great hall of the people peered across a protective 
wall of thousands of soldiers to view fistwaving citizens 
demanding an end to what they called chinas dictatorship 
the broad support the student movement was winning from workers 
and others became obvious a week later when tens of thousands of 
people lined the streets of beijing to cheer about 150000 students 
marching for democracy along the route enthusiastic onlookers 
gave the marchers money food and water 
enthusiastic crowds again appeared the following week when 
students marched to mark the 70th anniversary of chinas first 
student movement for democracy but the campaign seemed to falter 
after the march ended as leaders argued over what tactics to take 
to press their demands 
while students at most colleges in the capital ended a twoweek 
class boycott beijing university students kept up the heat 
refusing to return to their classrooms and demanding more action 
about 3500 students many from the nations most prestigious 
schools decided to press their demands by staging a hunger strike 
at tiananmen beginning may 13 two days before the arrival of 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to china to normalize ties 
after 30 years of icy relations 
the government urged the students to end the strike before 
gorbachevs arrival so as not to spoil the nations image students 
hotly debated what to do in the predawn hours of may 15 before 
deciding to continue their fast forcing several changes in the 
soviet leaders schedule that embarrassed the government 
as the fasting students health began to deteriorate beijing 
residents grew increasingly miffed at the governments failure to 
meet the hunger strikers demands of dialogue with officials and a 
retraction of an editorial that called the movement a 
disturbance 
in the largest protest of communist chinas 40year history 
well over 1 million people poured into downtown beijing on 
wednesday in support of the hunger strikers many called for the 
resignation of premier li peng viewed as a conservative and 
senior leader deng xiaoping demonstrations were reported in at 
least two dozen other chinese cities 
another mass protest the next day was answered by li with a 
hardline speech and the declaration of martial law in much of the 
capital throngs of workers rushing to tiananmen to protect the 
students yelled li peng step down and said his retirement 
was the only way the demonstrations would end 
communist party chief zhao ziyang a relative liberal 
sympathetic with many grievances raised by demonstrators 
reportedly has offered to resign although there has been no 
official announcement 
lis future also seems uncertain as he faces virtually 
universal condemnation from the people of beijing 
deng has not appeared publicly or been quoted by official media 
since he met gorbachev on may 16

israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin 
reviewed the military situation in the middle east with defense 
secretary dick cheney today without broaching any requests for new 
weapons deals defense officials said 
the officials who asked not to be named said rabin and cheney 
met privately and with other officials for more than an hour at the 
pentagon with rabin offering the newly installed cheney a progress 
report on the overall situation in the middle east 
rabin and cheney did not discuss in any detail israels 
latest regional peace initiative the sources said rabin and 
president bush are expected to delve more deeply into that issue 
during white house talks on tuesday 
the pentagon in a prepared statement described todays talks 
as upbeat and friendly 
most of the time was spent talking about the current status of 
the military situation in israel the statement said mr rabin 
identified the most significant recent development in the region as 
the end of the iraniraq war 
the defense sources said rabin had declined to predict for 
cheney what the current ceasefire in that war would mean to israel 
basically rabin said he didnt know what the ceasefire would 
mean or whether it would hold said one official he told 
cheney the war had dominated the region for the past decade he 
also said despite the ceasefire the arms race in the middle east 
goes on 
iran and iraq after more than eight years of fighting agreed 
to a ceasefire last august 
the pentagon said in its statement that rabin expressed the 
hope that the united states will continue to support israel 
mr cheney indicated that we will do our best within the 
constraints of the budget to continue our current level of support 
to israel 
the israeli defense chief however did not get specific about 
us support and did not press for any new arms deals or discuss 
specific weapons added one source 
this meet was very low key the official said neither 
side asked the other for anything 
the meeting ended with rabin extending an invitation to cheney 
to visit israel the secretary accepted the invitation without 
committing to a specific date the sources said 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said today rabin would meet 
with bush on tuesday to discuss middle east peace efforts and 
israels controversial proposal for palestinian elections 
president bush has said he supports the idea of elections as a 
way to get the peace process underway 
the plan calls for voting to chose palestinian representatives 
to negotiate selfrule for the 15 million residents of the west 
bank and gaza strip negotiations on a permanent solution would 
start after three years 
the plo executive committee rejected the israeli plan and other 
palestinian critics say it fails to deal with palestinian 
aspirations for an independent state

the soviet supreme court said monday that citizens 
may not be thrown in jail for expressing truthful criticism of 
officials limiting the scope of a new decree widely criticized by 
reformers and dissidents alike 
the court reviewed a decree passed by the presidium of the 
supreme soviet on april 8 because citizens already have been 
arrested under differing interpretations of the law according to a 
report distributed by the tass news agency 
critics charged that a provision of the decree banning 
discrediting officials and government bodies was written in such a 
way that a person could be prosecuted for telling the unpleasant 
truth 
alvydas juozaidis a spokesman for lithuanias grassroots 
sajudis organization called the decree pure stalinism among 
its other critics were human rights activist andrei d sakharov 
some opponents have called for the congress of peoples 
deputies the new parliament that meets for the first time 
thursday to overturn the law 
the court said wellfounded argumentative criticism of the 
action and decisions of these organs and officials by citizens 
acting publicly in the framework of socialist law cannot be viewed 
as a criminally punishable act 
the courts action taken as president mikhail s gorbachev 
seeks to strengthen the role of law in soviet society constituted 
one of the rare times the court has acted to ensure a controversial 
measure is applied consistently 
the supreme court instructed lower courts the decree touched 
only intentional public distribution of slanderous inventions 
that undermines faith in officials 
it said that the decree did not include dispatches in the 
press and any other form of information reflecting insufficiencies 
in the activity of these organs social organizations and 
officials 
the court said its declaration was a balance between protecting 
officials from insults and slander and protecting the rights of 
individuals to express their views 
tass did not say how many criminal cases have been filed on the 
basis of the new law nor did it address any of them in detail 
but it said that in the month and a half since the decree was 
published differences in interpretation already had come to light 
soviet officials have said that the new decree is more specific 
and less subject to abuse than articles 70 and 190 of the criminal 
code that for years have banned antisoviet agitation and 
propaganda and antisoviet slander 
politically controled courts used those laws for years to 
imprison dissidents last year the soviet union said it intended to 
radically alter those laws it stopped arresting people under them 
and in the past two years has released hundreds of people arrested 
under them 
but dissidents and reformers alike reacted angrily to the 
decree claiming the provision against discrediting officials 
actually was worse than the previous law 
the law also bans public calls to overthrow the government and 
premeditated acts aimed at inciting national or racial 
animosity 
in other action that also expressed its desire to right the 
legal abuses of the past tass said the supreme court continued its 
rehabiliation who were unlawfully convicted of antisoviet activity 
in the 1930s through the 1960s 
those rehabiliated monday included former midlevel officials who 
were accused under josef stalin of being german spies or taking 
part in a conspiracy to kill the popular leningrad party chief 
sergei kirov in 1934 
a latvian poet ke skueniek who was convicted in 1962 of 
antisoviet agitation also was cleared

bribery charges were filed against two leading 
politicians in the recruit influencebuying case monday but 
critics said prosecutors had not dug deeply enough into the 
scandal which has shaken politics and business 
those charged were takao fujinami a former cabinet minister and 
member of the governing liberal democratic party and katsuya 
ikeda former secretarygeneral of the opposition komeito clean 
government party 
if convicted they could be imprisoned for up to seven years 
fujinami 56 and ikeda 52 were not taken into custody 
japanese law protects members from being jailed while parliament is 
in session unless the legislative body grants permission 
they are widely expected to be the only politicians charged 
although 17 legislators or aides are known to have received bargain 
unlested shares of stock from the recruit co 
thirteen are from the governing liberal democratic party 
including 11 members of former prime minister yasuhiro nakasones 
cabinet 
nakasone said he received the news of the charges solemnly 
and wished to apologize to the japanese people 
prosecutors said fujinami and ikeda received donations and 
heavily discounted stock shares from recruit in exchange for using 
political influence to help the information conglomerates magazine 
publishing business 
all 14 others arrested or charged in the recruit scandal were 
bureaucrats or businessmen 
ikeda a former journalist and fourterm member of the lower 
house said the charges were a fabrication of reality and he 
would prove his innocence in court 
he announced last week he would resign from both parliament and 
the buddhistaffiliated komeito party 
yuichi ichikawa current secretarygeneral of the party said it 
was extremely regrettable that charges had been filed against a 
member but added that prosecutors should carry the investigation 
further 
actions taken to date arent enough to clarify and get to the 
core of the scandal he said if the investigation ends now it 
will have failed to reach the people who were most responsible 
prime minister noboru takeshita said last month he would resign 
to take responsibility for the scandal which has eroded public 
trust in politics the governing partys search for a successor has 
been complicated by the scandals links to most of its senior 
members 
ichikawa and other opposition party leaders said they would 
continue pressing for a full investigation 
eiji suzuki head of the japan federation of employers 
associations said monday all members of parliament who received 
recruit shares should resign the japan broadcasting corp reported 
fujinami the chief government spokesman in nakasones cabinet 
and an eightterm member of the lower house was considered a 
rising star in the party he submitted his resignation to the party 
monday but said he would retain his parliament seat 
he has acknowledged that an aide bought 12000 shares of stock 
in a recruit subsidiary at a discounted price in 1986 then made a 
profit of about 30 million yen 215000 when the stock went on 
public sale news reports say fujinami used some of the profit to 
buy a house in tokyo 
the former labor minister also is said to have received about 90 
million yen 640000 in political donations from recruit 
ikeda has admitted his brother bought 5000 shares of stock in 
the recruit subsidiary and made a profit of about 10 million yen 
71000 reports also say ikeda received 14 million yen 
100000 in donations from recruit 
both politicians have denied personal involvement in the stock 
transactions but some of the profits allegedly were deposited in 
their bank accounts 
prosecutors said ikeda and fujinami used political influence to 
persuade officials to continue a gentlemens agreement among 
government agencies and private companies on a uniform date for 
hiring of graduating college students 
recruit considered the agreement critical to the sales of its 
employment magazines 
with the filing of charges against ikeda and fujinami 
prosecutors said their bribery investigation was complete and they 
would focus on illegal donations made by the conglomerate news 
reports said 
japanese law restricts a company of recruits size to 15 million 
yen 107000 a year in political donations 
takeshita alone has acknowledged receiving more than 130 million 
yen about 1 million from recruit in 198587

the leadership of the communist party on monday 
endorsed mikhail s gorbachev to be chosen again for the post of 
soviet president when the new parliament convenes for the first 
time later this week 
at a separate meeting of deputies to the congress human rights 
activist andrei d sakharov also endorsed gorbachev but with 
reservations 
my position is that we have no leader except for gorbachev 
but he is not immaculate not immaculate in terms of a very large 
number of actions sakharov said in a speech 
the official tass news agency said the partys central committee 
met to discuss the activities of the congress of peoples deputies 
which will meet thursday 
among the duties of the new congress are to elect the president 
and a smaller more active supreme soviet legislature 
tass said the central committee recommended election of 
gorbachev as soviet president he was elected president oct 1 by 
the old supreme soviet parliament which is being replaced by the 
congress and the new supreme soviet it will elect 
the 251member central committee the partys policymaking 
body had been expected to meet prior to the congress to set its 
approach to the stronger legislative branch being formed as 
gorbachev attempts to strengthen the soviet government 
many questions of the congress exact functions have not been 
clarified yet just days before it meets 
the vast majority of deputies are members of the communist 
party but there is a large block of reformers who are impatient 
with progress so far implementing gorbachevs reforms 
many of them especially radicals from the baltic republics of 
lithuania latvia and estonia cannot be counted on to follow the 
central committees dictates 
on sunday moscow firebrand boris n yeltsin and others told a 
rally that they had formed their own program of radical changes 
that includes urgent action to heal the economy and multicandidate 
elections for the presidency 
yeltsin told the rally that moscow deputies had drafted an 
agenda that demands radical decisions on the economy social 
justice and glasnost 
the deputies are demanding laws on pensions childrens rights 
and property yeltsin said 
tass said yeltsin was among 34 speakers monday at the central 
committee meeting but it provided no details of his remarks 
one deputy alexander tolstoukhov told the sunday gathering 
that yelstin should be elected president yeltsin has denied in the 
past that he is interested in challenging gorbachev and no clear 
opposition to gorbachev has formed 
on monday scores of deputies signed a letter to gorbachev 
backing a draft agenda by moscow deputies 
the agenda calls on gorbachev to make a report to the congress 
on the state of the soviet union before the election for president 
is held 
sakharov speaking at the deputies meeting said i think we 
have no other real candidate than mikhail gorbachev 
compared to gorbachev the candidacy of yeltsin would be 
unsatisfactory he said gorbachevs mistakes must be corrected 
by the peoples will sakharov said 
in the past sakharov has criticized policy on ethnic relations 
and government decisions that he sees as limiting its commitment to 
free expression 
the congress consists of 2250 members 1500 chosen on the 
basis of geographical representation and 750 chosen from the 
communist party and its affiliates social professional and trade 
union organizations 
the party itself has 100 seats and gorbachev was elected a 
deputy of the congress from the communist party

members of atampts largest union voted 
overwhelmingly to authorize a strike if a new contract is not 
reached by midnight saturday the union said monday as negotiations 
entered a critical stage 
the communications workers of america which reprsents about 
130000 atampt workers did not release a breakdown of its nationwide 
strikeauthorization vote 
the international brotherhood of electrical workers which is 
negotiating jointly with cwa and represents an additional 40000 
employees is conducting a separate vote strike authorization is 
expected 
american telephone amp telegraphs contracts with the two unions 
expire at 1159 pm edt saturday a company spokesman said he was 
hopeful a new threeyear agreement would be reached this week and 
there were indications the unions might not immediately call a 
strike even if the two sides remained far apart at the deadline 
it is routine for the rankandfile union members to give the 
leadership such authorization atampt spokesman herb linnen said 
it doesnt mean there will be a strike we look forward to a hard 
week a challenging week of bargaining and are still optimistic 
that a settlement can be reached with the unions without a work 
stoppage 
a cwa statement stressed that a strike is only one of several 
tactics to achieve a fair contract 
among those tactics is a nationwide labor boycott of atampts 
longdistance service a move the unions say will cost the company 
upwards of 10 million a month 
the boycott plan calls for the nations unions and related 
organizations which predominately are atampt customers to 
temporarily switch their longdistance calls to nonunion us 
sprint the unions and the aflcio also have said they will urge 
their major suppliers to boycott atampt as well 
if atampt and its unions appear close to an agreement the unions 
likely would agree to negotiate for a day or two past the 
contracts expiration 
if on the other hand the two sides remain far apart cwa 
president morton bahr and ibew president john barry have the power 
to decide whether to strike immediately or to implement the boycott 
plan in hopes of pressuring atampt into concessions 
although negotiators have been meeting since march atampt has yet 
to present a formal offer that should come early this week 
union officials have said the two sides remain far apart on 
three major issues employee contributions to health insurance pay 
and job security 
at this stage atampt has yet to seriously address issues of 
concern to our members particularly the issue of employment 
security bahr said management is pushing a package of 
sweeping unacceptable medical cuts and other proposals which 
attack seniority 
barry issued a statement promising unity among the unions which 
were bitter rivals at this stage of contract talks three years ago 
together our members are determined to win jobs with justice 
and a contract worthy of the skills and productivity of our 
members he said 
in 1986 cwa struck atampt for 26 days but the company was able to 
keep half of its manufacturing plants open because the ibew agreed 
to work provided its members were given any added benefits cwa won 
through its strike

richard secord the retired air force major 
general facing new charges in the irancontra affair pleaded 
innocent monday to charges of covering up his alleged profits from 
selling arms to iran and the nicaraguan contras 
secord was released on his own recognizance after being 
arraigned before us district court chief judge aubrey robinson 
prosecutors and defense attorneys said they will discuss whether 
to combine the latest set of charges with an earlier indictment of 
secord they will report back to the court may 31 
robinson said meanwhile that he expects the trials of secord 
and john poindexter once presidential national security adviser 
to begin simultaneously the judge said it would be impossible for 
him to handle both irancontra cases which probably will be tried 
this fall robinson is handling pretrial proceedings in the 
poindexter case 
poindexter secord secords business partner albert hakim and 
oliver north were charged in 1988 with illegally diverting more 
than 14 million in iranian arms sale proceeds to the nicaraguan 
rebels 
prosecutor reid weingarten said the office of independent 
counsel lawrence walsh has every intention of prosecuting hakim 
after secords trail 
the latest indictment against secord accuses him of obstructing 
the congressional irancontra investigation in 1987 perjury and 
making false statements the nine counts were unsealed may 11 after 
norths trial ended 
secord lawyer thomas green said he might have to withdraw from 
the case because i was privy to and was a party to discussions 
with congress in connection with secords 1987 congressional 
testimony therefore green said he might be called as a witness 
at the trial 
green said he would under those circumstances withdraw 
from the case in favor of a partner in his law firm james e 
sharp who stood next to secord as he was arraigned 
weingarten said that usually the entire firm is dismissed as 
the attorney for a defendant when one of the firms lawyers becomes 
a witness in the case weingarten said we must explore whether 
anyone in the firm of sharp green amp lankford should represent 
secord 
secord is accused of lying when he told congress that he wasnt 
taking profits from his network of foreign corporations and swiss 
bank accounts part of an operation that became known as the 
enterprise in fact said the federal grand jury indictment secord 
used a former internal revenue service lawyer on a continuous 
basis to manage over a million dollars of profits allocated to the 
defendant richard v secord 
he also was accused of lying when he testified that his only 
financial gain from the arms sales to iran and the contras was his 
6000amonth salary that 500000 from the enterprise funneled 
to one of his companies was a loan and that he was unaware any 
money from the enterprise benefited north 
north was convicted earlier this month of three criminal charges 
in the irancontra affair including illegally accepting a 13800 
home security system from secord in addition the government 
alleges secord and hakim arranged to set aside 200000 as a death 
benefit for the education of norths children 
north called on secord to secretly run weapons to the contras 
during a congressional cutoff in military aid to the rebel force 
and to assist in the reagan administrations secret arms sales to 
iran

the american college health association said 
today a study of 19 us campuses found that two out of every 1000 
students tested was infected with the aids virus a rate below the 
national average but a figure one official said should cause real 
concern 
officials said the study points up the need for more aggressive 
efforts to prevent the spread of the deadly virus on college 
campuses 
the study the nations first survey attempting to determine 
the prevalence of aids among college students tested the blood of 
16861 students who sought medical attention in their campus health 
centers 
of those 30 tested positive for the human immunodeficiency 
virus or hiv which amounts to an overall infection rate of 02 
percent said the association which conducted the study with the 
federal centers for disease control 
no student tested positive at 10 of the schools while five of 
the schools had rates of 04 percent or higher 
richard keeling director of student health services at the 
university of virginia and president of the college health 
association said the survey results establish beyond any doubt 
that hiv infection is a current problem on college campuses 
he said the fact that hiv infection appears on campuses across 
the country should cause real concern 
by comparison studies have indicated that the infection rate 
among prisoners is four out of 1000 or 04 percent nationwide 
researchers believe 1 million to 15 million people are infected a 
rate of 04 percent to 06 percent 
keeling said the overall 02 percent rate is somewhat higher 
than we hypothesized at the outset but he added that these 
numbers are meant to be indicators rather than statements of 
specific levels of infection 
helene gayle an epidemiologist at the centers for disease 
control who worked on the survey said the prevalence of infection 
appears to be about the same for college students as for other 
groups where they would not expect to see an extremely high rate 
she said for example studies have shown a rate of infection among 
military recruits of 014 percent 
at a news conference keeling said that of the 30 students who 
tested positive 28 were male and two were female he said he had no 
breakdown of the number of men and women whose blood was tested as 
part of a study they also had no breakdown on the age of students 
in the study 
he said the highest campus rate was 09 percent but the study 
did not identify rates for individual campuses 
keeling said his advice to college students is that 
uninformed unprotected unsober sexual activity is highly 
risky 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
fatal isease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections the virus 
most often is spread through close contact with blood blood 
products or semen from infected persons 
its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug 
users although a small percentage of cases are attributed to 
transfusions of contaminated blood heterosexual contact and spread 
from infected pregnant women to their offspring 
the 19 campuses comprising 18 public and private institutions 
were selected to represent a cross section of higher education in 
the united states the association said 
however the association picked only large universities because 
they tend to attract students from their geographic areas also 
the survey was restricted to students who had routine blood tests 
done at their student health centers 
the testing was done anonymously and results were not broken 
out for the individual schools 
the association said it will continue the study during the next 
academic year and wants include several more schools including 
historically black institutions and some with predominantly 
hispanic students 
the schools included in the survey were

one of britains best regional museums that was 
destroyed by german bombers and paved over as a parking lot will be 
the focus of an unusual archaeological dig this year 
the city of hull in northeast england opened the site of the old 
hull municipal museum to the public monday turning it into a kind 
of retrospective of the 1940s with extracts from war broadcasts 
and popular songs piped into the dig said project coordinator 
david fleming 
the sixmonth dig was organized by civic officials assisted by 
an american museum to save what is left of a oncefine historical 
collection 
the neoclassical museum collapsed in an inferno of german 
incendiary bombs in 1943 and was left in ruins for several years 
until for safety reasons it was flattened and turned into a 
parking lot fleming said 
for all the world it looked like any other car park said 
fleming the principal keeper of museums in the coastal city on the 
north sea 
but when we put in a ditch in 1988 we realized a high 
proportion of the collection had survived intact although it was 
very badly damaged 
fleming said in an interview it was hoped the dig would not only 
save the treasures but reveal how some objects especially those 
made from modern materials decay in soil 
the collections ranged from fossils and roman coins to the 
largest prehistoric boat found in britain and objects made from 
nylon and rayon which were new materials at the time he said 
it is bizarre he said were not talking about a normal 
archaeological site were trying to piece together a moment in 
time june 23 1943 
the site was related to people alive here theres a great 
emotional relationship in hull to this dig he said 
financial support for the 192000 project has also come from 
the statefunded national heritage memorial fund and the heafitz 
museum in boston he said 
city officials hadnt excavated in the postwar years because 
hull had been bombed heavily there was a lot of rebuilding to 
do he said it was just something put to the back of peoples 
minds 
some of the treasures were lost before the rubble was cleared 
we dont really like to call it looting it was hard to 
know the mentality at the time and it looked to be totally 
abandoned he said adding that the extent of the losses was 
unknown and most museum records were destroyed 
after the dig any treasures salvaged will be housed at one of 
the citys other museums said fleming

flooding forced many snakes into populated areas 
but experts asked residents to restrain their fears and spare the 
reptiles many of which eat rodents 
theres a lot of harmless species in the dallas area the ones 
that are left alone will return to their homes as soon as they can 
because they tend to live in the same place all their lives said 
ardell mitchell reptile supervisor at the dallas zoo 
and experts say the snakes may be doing homeowners a favor 
since last weeks flooding caused by heavy rainstorms may also 
have forced a few rodents to higher ground 
harmless texas rat snakes diamondback and blotched water 
snakes which can grow to more than 3 feet long are the most 
common species in the area but some areas of dallas have venomous

one week before the big nato summit 
begins officials are still scrambling to mend a rift between the 
united states and many of its european allies over shortrange 
nuclear weapons in europe 
the disagreement may not be completely settled by the time 
president bush and other alliance leaders gather may 2930 in 
brussels to mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
but reassuring words by bush and french president francois 
mitterrand suggest the issue wont be allowed to disrupt the summit 
at least on the surface 
its a much bigger issue in europe where feelings on 
europeanbased nuclear weapons run sharp and deep than in the 
united states 
even in europe however one diplomat speaking only on 
condition of anonymity said there will be something to paper 
over the differences so we can emerge reasonably united from the 
summit 
richard fieldhouse a research fellow at the stockholm 
international peace research institute in sweden said the issue 
has become too steamed up making it difficult to find a 
solution 
theres a bit too much enmity theres a lot of political 
maneuvering and a lot of bad blood politically he said 
but hans binnendijk director of studies for the international 
institute for strategic studies predicted a way would be found to 
narrow the split in time for the anniversary gathering 
it is clear that germany and the united states dont want to 
see this thing blow up at the summit he said 
over the weekend bush said the dispute was a vexing 
question with differing opinions by strongwilled people from 
strong countries 
however he also said i think great progress has been made 
and i think that we could well have this resolved before the 
summit 
mitterrand after meeting with bush said on this problem 
like on other problems at the outset people have diverging views 
differing opinions but the important thing is to come to a meeting 
of the minds and to achieve a common answer and this has always 
been the case in the alliance 
the dispute stems from a push by the united states and britain 
to replace the aging lance surfacetosurface nuclear missile with 
a new more powerful weapon 
the arms campaign has become increasingly unpopular in many 
european countries upbeat about the friendlier moves by soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev and reluctant to do anything to cool 
the warmer eastwest climate 
continental europeans are really not interested in another 
round of nuclear modernization said fieldhouse 
politicians he said will have a hard time trying to convince 
the public its necessary 
the united states had hoped for a strong signal of support from 
the allies for the lance modernization program but that now 
appears highly unlikely 
german chancellor helmut kohl worried about the survival of his 
centerright government wants to delay a decision on production of 
the new missile until 1991 or 1992 after important elections next 
year in germany 
moreover his government unexpectedly demanded that the alliance 
enter into early negotiations with the sovietled warsaw pact to 
reduce shortrange or theater nuclear weapons in europe 
the united states and britain have strongly opposed that 
arguing the emphasis should be on eastwest bargaining to slash 
conventional or nonnuclear arms in europe 
us and british officials worry that opening discussions on 
reducing shortrange nuclear weapons would inevitably lead to 
removal of all those forces from europe 
nato contends it maintains a nuclear stockpile as a deterrent to 
balance the enormous superiority the east has built up in 
conventional arms 
germany has gained support for its position although with 
varying degrees of enthusiasm from belgium denmark norway 
greece italy and spain 
gorbachev has tried to add more pressure on the western allies 
he recently promised to unilaterally withdraw 500 shortrange 
nuclear weapons from europe this year 
according to western estimates the soviet union has 1450 
shortrange nuclear missile launchers in europe nato has 88 lance 
launchers most based in germany 
in their meetings nato officials have been trying to find 
acceptable language on the weapons issue to write into the 
comprehensive concept a blueprint for alliance strategy in arms 
control and force planning 
the roadmap which will be presented to bush and the other 
leaders at the summit lacks only a section on the allies stand on 
shortrange nuclear forces 
a number of possibilities are still on the table but no 
compromise solution has yet emerged officials say 
the european diplomat suggested the officials may signal their 
willingness to enter into negotiations with the warsaw pact on 
reducing theater nuclear weapons but not now discussions would 
hinge on progress in newly opened eastwest talks in vienna on 
slashing conventional forces a position bush has publicly 
embraced 
the officials though could put off a decision altogether 
perhaps bumping the issue to a commission which would report its 
findings to nato officials by a certain later 
the united states intends to go ahead with research and 
development for a replacement to the lance missile military 
analysts say it will be obsolete by 1995 
nato members are canada the united states belgium britain 
denmark germany greece france iceland italy luxembourg the 
netherlands norway portugal spain and turkey

edward perkins the first 
black us ambassador to south africa ended his tour of duty 
monday with a salute to the countrys blacks 
its pretty difficult to stifle the desire of people to be 
free he said 
perkins gave his first news conference in 2 years in south 
africa just before boarding a plane to the united states where he 
is expected to become directorgeneral of the foreign service 
the most encouraging thing has been to see the reaction of 
the black majority to the efforts of the government to stifle overt 
unhappiness with the status quo he said 
while the government has been fairly successful in many cases 
with the state of emergency i think the black majority seem even 
more determined even stronger in making a difference 
the 60yearold louisiana native said he was most disappointed 
by the continued existence of the state of emergency the banning 
of 17 organizations a couple of years ago and the inclination to 
arrest a lot of people and detain them without charge 
perkins consistently has criticized such practices he also 
attended political trials and protest services and traveled 
extensively visiting some of the poorest and most militant black 
communities however he made only a handful of public speeches and 
until last week gave no news interviews 
the united states should be and intends to remain engaged in 
south africa perkins said we must steadfastly manifest what 
we believe in as a nation so that our message is heard and 
understood all over south africa in every village and in every 
township 
we do not wish to impose an ideology but we do want to 
express our belief in human rights the rule of law equal justice 
under law and equal participation in government under a 
constitution which has been decided by representatives of a 
majority of south africans 
his departure comes as the us government prepares for a visit 
from national party leader fw de klerk designated the next 
president of south africa and just after a meeting between 
president bush and clergymen who favor more economic sanctions to 
pressure pretoria to end apartheid 
sanctions have been a major issue during perkins 
ambassadorship which started a month after congress imposed trade 
embargoes in 1986 since then an argument has raged in south africa 
and the united states about whether such sanctions hurt the black 
majority by weakening the economy or help them by forcing reforms 
the purpose of that act was to ensure that african national 
congress leader nelson mandela was freed that political 
organizations were unbanned and that free political dialogue 
happened in the country among others said perkins who refused 
to give his personal view on the issue 
mandela has not been released and the anc is still banned and 
on top of that several other organizations have been banned if you 
look at it in those terms its easy to say sanctions have not been 
effective he said 
however he said americans who push for sanctions look upon 
them as a tool which will remind the people in political power that 
they have to make some changes before they are looked upon as 
responsible members of the western world of nations 
he said south africa is changing to a different kind of 
country to one where the majority population will have a decisive 
say in how they are governed 
i am encouraged he said but i would say as an outside 
observer the road is still a pretty long one to travel

secretary of state james a baker iii called 
on arabs and israelis today to show a more conciliatory attitude 
towards each others interests as a means of beginning a serious 
negotiating process 
let the arab world take concrete steps toward accommodation 
with israel not in place of the peace process but as a catalyst 
for it baker said in a speech to the american israel public 
affairs committee a group that lobbies for us support of israel 
he called on arabs to end the economic boycott of israel to 
respect israels right to membership in international organizations 
and to repudiate the odious line that zionism is racism 
at the same time baker issued an appeal to conservative 
elements in israel calling on them to lay aside once and for 
all the unrealistic vision of a greater israel 
baker said that israeli interests in the west bank and gaza 
strip can be accommodated in a settlement based on un security 
council resolutions spelling out framework for a peace settlement 
he called on israel to forswear annexation of occupied 
territories to stop settlement activities in these areas and to 
allow schools to reopen 
he asked israelis to reach out to the palestinians as 
neighbors who deserve political rights 
in a similar vein baker urged palestinians to reach out to 
israelis and convince them of your peaceful intentions 
you have the most to gain from doing so and no one else can 
or will do it for you he said and no one is going to 
deliver israel for you

in most statehouses if a legislators 
vote was cast while he was away or a bill was mysteriously 
transferred from one committee to another it would be discussed 
heatedly for months 
its all in a days work in the rhode island senate 
since the democratic party which controls the senate 419 was 
torn apart in a power struggle at the beginning of the year there 
have been sharp conflicts between majority leader david r carlin 
jr and judiciary committee chairman john j bevilacqua 
fourteen of carlins 16 top bills were killed by committees 
controlled by the bevilacqua side and carlins supporters have 
defeated a few of the oppositions bills on the senate floor 
the republicans helped bevilacquas group strip carlin of most 
of his traditional power in a series of 2624 votes at the 
beginning of the year minority leader robert d goldberg won the 
right to unilaterally summon bills out of committee and onto the 
floor for votes 
gop senators have emerged as power brokers and peacemakers 
siding with carlin to defeat some questionable bills sponsored by 
the bevilacqua group 
similar upheavals occurred this year in connecticut and north 
carolina where bipartisan coalitions ousted democratic house 
speakers an attempt in florida failed when the democratic speaker 
formed an alliance of his own with republicans in indiana where 
the house has equal numbers of democrats and republicans the 
parties agreed to elect cospeakers who would alternate control of 
the chamber 
in rhode island with no clearcut winner the feuding has 
continued intermittently 
the general assembly normally adjourns in late may or early 
june but the senate is several weeks behind last years pace and 
the big test of the year budget negotiations with the house and 
republican gov edward d diprete has not yet started 
carlin and bevilacqua met may 16 to try to hammer out a unified 
senate position their first facetoface meeting in months aside 
from brief encounters on the senate floor 
they said later that agreement would take some time but would 
not be impossible in part because the states tight financial 
picture means little money will be left over for lawmakers pet 
projects 
the meeting followed a tense week marked by what carlin labeled 
two absolutely incredible incidents 
the first was when state sen james s dambra a democrat who 
supports carlin was recorded as voting with the bevilacqua faction 
on a hotly contested bill while he was in boston for the day 
bevilacqua said someone must have accidentally pressed dambras 
voting button carlin and dambra said that was impossible 
a day later the carlin faction noticed that a bill assigned to 
the corporations committee where carlin has a majority had 
somehow been transferred to bevilacquas judiciary committee 
lt gov roger n begin presiding over the senate ruled the 
bill was improperly reported out and he was upheld on a 2424 vote 
the republicans helped carlin on that vote they also have 
helped defeat bills sponsored by the bevilacqua group that would 
have allowed deer hunters to trespass on private property and 
shortcircuited the normal chartering procedure for a connecticut 
man who wants to open a rhode island bank 
carlin has begun looking ahead to the 1990 elections 
in a recent interview he said the bevilacqua groups successful 
fight to defeat a carlinbacked bill banning assault weapons would 
be used against bevilacquas supporters in the election 
its a motherhood and apple pie issue and they voted against 
motherhood and apple pie carlin said 
but the feud is not universal 
carlins press secretary suzanne costa has helped several 
bevilacqua supporters such as state sen james m donelan to 
publicize their bills 
that person suzanne is here for all the senators said 
donelan she has done a good job for me i think a lot of the 
staff has tried to remain neutral

the rev sun myung moons unification church 
failed monday in a supreme court attempt to kill a lawsuit by two 
former members who say they were brainwashed into joining the 
church 
church officials had said the constitutions guarantee of 
religious freedom should nullify the lawsuit but the justices 
dismissed the appeal without comment refusing to shield the church 
from the suit seeking damages 
in other action the court 
rejected an appeal by mass murderer john wayne gacy the 
chicago man convicted and sentenced to death in 1980 for killing 33 
boys and young men no one in us history has been convicted of 
killing more people 
ruled unanimously that a lawsuit against the owners of the 
cruise ship achille lauro target of a terrorist hijacking in 1985 
may be tried in a federal court in new york city rather than in 
naples italy 
agreed to use a case from colorado to study a federal 
regulation aimed at saving the government time and money when it 
mistakenly overpays some social security recipients 
let stand a ruling that chicago may be sued for monetary 
damages in state court by people contending officials allowed 
excessive noise and air pollution at ohare international airport 
rejected an appeal by former chicago councilman thomas e 
keane convicted of fraud for illegally conspiring to buy and sell 
taxdelinquent properties the court refused to use the case to set 
guidelines on when some people may challenge their fraud 
convictions after completing prison terms for those convictions 
limited by a 63 vote federal judges power to exclude 
potentially prejudicial evidence from civil trials the court 
allowed a jury to be told about the criminal record of a young 
pennsylvania man who sued over the loss of his arm in a car wash 
accident 
in the unification church case david molko and tracy leal said 
in lawsuits that they were duped into becoming moonies in 
california 
molko saud he was a 27yearold law school graduate in 1979 when 
recruited by church members in san francisco 
he said two men approached him at a bus stop and told him they 
belonged to an international community of socially conscious people 
he went to dinner with them and thereafter to a retreat outside 
the city where he and others were kept to a tight schedule of 
lectures group discussions and calisthenics he said 
molko said the group members repeatedly denied their 
organization was a religious one only on the 12th day was he told 
the group belonged to the unification church 
molko said he was confused and angry but stayed on when members 
persuaded him that deception had been necessary because of the 
churchs negative reputation 
ms leal told a similar story in court papers she said she was 
a 19yearold college student when a recruiter approached her at a 
san francisco bus station in 1979 
she said she was not told the group was part of the unification 
church until her 22nd day at the retreat 
ms leal and molko remained church members for several months 
before they were abducted by deprogrammers who had been hired 
by their parents 
they are suing the church for punitive damages for the emotional 
distress they say they suffered molko also is seeking the return 
of 6000 he donated to the church 
the california supreme court voting 61 last october overruled 
two lower courts and reinstated the suits it ordered jury trials 
the state court said the molko and ms leal are entitled to 
trials to present evidence they were brainwashed and the 
churchs agents rendered them incapable of deciding not to join 
the state court rejected arguments that forcing the church to 
defend itself against fraud allegations interferes with its right 
to practice religion freely 
the national council of churches other religious organizations 
and a group consisting primarily of college professors had urged 
the justices to overrule the state court 
the groups had said the state court ruling has had and will 
continue to have a serious chilling effect on religious 
proselytizing and conversion in california and elsewhere

the cape hatteras lighthouse has symbolized 
the rugged beauty of north carolinas outer banks islands for 
generations and now the tower that warned ships of dangerous 
shoals is itself threatened by the sea 
for years debate has raged about what should be done to 
preserve the nations oldest and tallest brick lighthouse 
when it was built in 1870 replacing one that had fallen into 
the sea the 208foot lighthouse was 1500 feet from the atlantic 
ocean the shoreline has advanced about 11 feet per year since then 
and waves now crash less than 200 feet from its base 
the future of the landmark was left uncertain again last week 
when the national park services regional office in atlanta said it 
was putting off a decision on how to preserve the tower 
instead the park service said it plans to issue a special 
document listing options for protecting the lighthouse in about 
three weeks then the agency will accept public comment for 30 to 
90 days before making a final decision 
were trying to determine whether the comment cries out for 
hearings or meetings said james howard a park service spokesman 
over the years a number of efforts including steel groins and 
artificial seaweed to hold sand have done little to slow the 
seas natural advance 
in 1986 the us army corps of engineers was set to build a 
23foothigh revetment and seawall around the spire at a cost of 
56 million 
but a group calling itself the move the lighthouse committee 
persuaded the park service to reconsider saying the ocean would 
eventually surround the lighthouse making it an island 
last year a panel of the national academy of sciences 
recommended the 2600ton lighthouse be moved inland the panel of 
10 experts estimated that moving the lighthouse 500 feet on rails 
would cost 46 million and take a year 
if you want to save the lighthouse there is absolutely no 
alternative said orrin pilkey a professor of geology at duke 
university and a member of the move the lighthouse committee 
but many residents of hatteras island fear the monument will 
collapse if it is moved instead they favor efforts to replenish 
the beaches using sand fences and more artificial seaweed or 
groins 
the academy of sciences committee acknowledged some detrimental 
effects of relocating the lighthouse as many as eight acres of 
ancient maritime forest in adjacent buxton woods could be lost in 
clearing a new site they said 
if they move it were going to lose something whether it falls 
or not because it wont be on the same site it was built on said 
rany jennette whose father was the last civilian keeper of the 
cape hatteras light 
jennette who was born in the adjacent lighthouse keepers 
quarters in 1921 comes up from his home in greenville sc every 
summer to work as a seasonal ranger and tour guide 
i would go up to the top any time my father would let me he 
said one thing i really enjoyed was using the old heavy 
spyglasses to watch the ships go by

red velvet ropes on monday blocked 
the entrances to elsinores atlantis casino hotel the first new 
jersey casino closed by gaming regulators for financial reasons

group of customers waited at the bottom of the stalled escalators 
a security guard arrived and told them the casino was closed for 
good 
there are apparently some people who dont read newspapers or 
watch television said henry budniak the atlantis security shift 
supervisor but these are a bunch of people who were attached to 
this place its sad 
well have to go look for another place to gamble said 
mildred kerns of philadelphia i feel so bad i feel like 
crying 
two other customers said they gambled until the bitter end at 4 
am when casino attendants stopped handing out change for the 
slot machines the last roulette wheel stopped spinning and dealers

we came to say goodbye said antoinette miozzi of 
philadelphia we love this place weve been coming here for all 
eight years its been open

of 2000 employees casino workers were required to turn in their 
gaming licenses but were told officials from the trump 
organization would visit the atlantis on tuesday to offer them

a soviet air force pilot who was wounded 
while fleeing his country has been moved to an ankara hospital from 
trabzon on the black sea where he landed his mig29 fighter state 
radio reported monday 
the radio did not identify the hospital and officials would not 
reveal the pilots whereabouts 
officials said they doubted the government would grant the 
soviet request for extradition newspapers said us experts had 
examined the mig29 the most modern jet in the soviet air force 
capt alexander zuyev landed saturday in trabzon with a 
bleeding arm wound and asked for asylum in the united states 
on monday a doctor in charge at the black sea university 
hospital said police came took him away and we dont know 
where 
the pilot is under the protection of turkish officials 
responsible for his safety said foreign ministry spokesman nazim 
belger 
turkey allowed the plane to be flown back to the soviet union on 
sunday it was stripped of rockets and weapons which were returned 
on a separate plane 
newspapers reported monday the mig29 was examined by turkish 
and us military experts turkish officials and the us embassy 
refused comment 
walter shonia of the soviet embassy told reporters zuyev was a 
terrorist and turkeys refusal to extradite him would amount to 
support for terrorism 
a turkish official said privately however the russians know 
that in many decades we have not sent back home any military 
person from east or west who asked for asylum 
in 1983 a soviet general in uniform walked across the border to 
turkey and was flown to the united states his name was not 
revealed in turkey but newspaper reports claimed he was a 
highlevel security officer 
three jets have been flown from the soviet union to turkey since 
1970 and the government returned only those soviets who wanted to 
go home 
pravda the newspaper of the soviet communist party reported 
monday that zuyev was working as a duty dispatcher at the tskhakaya 
airfield north of batumi and therefore was armed on the day of his 
flight it said he shot and wounded a sentry who fired back and 
wounded zuyev 
two other soviet fighters started chasing the mig29 but could 
not intercept zuyev because the border was so near pravda said

share prices on the hong kong stock exchange 
fell monday in reaction to political developments in china as 
concern continued in the british colony over its future when it 
reverts to china in eight years 
brokers say the activity had been expected because of the tense 
situation in china over student demonstrations for democratic 
reforms and the chinese governments declaration of martial law 
saturday to end the protests 
stock exchange executives urged investors to stay calm but 
brokers expect developments in china to continue to govern the 
markets activities some said it might take a week for the market 
to stabilize 
the hang seng index of blue chips plunged 33906 points to close 
at 280657 with all key shares suffering losses the index lost 
28827 points in 15 minutes when the market opened but recovered 
slightly to end the session at 288789 
on friday the last day of trading before the weekend holiday 
the index fell 13203 points in panic selling in the worst 
singleday plunge since the worldwide market collapse in october 
1987 
turnover totaled 3844 million monday compared with 316 
million on friday 
there are fears the failure of the student movement could affect 
hong kongs future and how china will govern the territory in 1997 
when it comes under chinese sovereignty 
under a sinobritish agreement signed in 1984 hong kong will 
become a special administrative region of china under a one 
country two systems formula china has promised to preserve hong 
kongs freewheeling social and economic system that has made it an 
international financial center for 50 years beyond 1997 and allow 
hong kong people to govern the territory 
but many of hong kongs 57 million residents remain skeptical 
of chinese promises and the viability of the concept that would 
allow a capitalistic enclave to exist under communism 
an estimated twothirds of hong kongs population are refugees 
from china or their descendants who fled the chinese mainland 
on sunday a crowd of hong kong chinese estimated at between 
400000 and 1 million rallied in support of the prodemocracy 
demonstrators in china in what was described as the largest protest 
march in the british colonys history 
the marchers who included staffers from chinas official xinhua 
news agency and other leftist organizations demanded the 
resignation of chinese premier li peng 
hong kong not noted for its political activism has found a 
rallying point which has stirred its collective consciousness to an 
extent that has surprised everyone said an editorial in the 
englishlanguage south china morning post

the florida supreme court refused 
monday to allow enforcement of a new state law requiring minors to 
get parental or judicial consent for abortions but moved up a 
hearing on the laws validity 
the decison means that single women under 18 throughout florida 
will be able to get abortions without consent of parents or judges 
at least until the high court rules following oral arguments june 
27 a lawyer for the state said 
the justices last week had decided to hear a case involving a 
15yearold girl in september but agreed monday to expedite the 
case at the request of florida attorney general bob butterworths 
office 
the state repeated a request to allow enforcement of the law 
until the supreme court rules on its validity but the justices 
denied that motion for a second time 
with the denial of the stay it is our opinion that the law is 
unenforceable statewide said assistant attorney general mitchell 
franks 
the states 5th district court of appeal ruling in the case 
involving the 15yearold struck down the abortion consent law as 
unconstitutional 
the case last week went from the florida high court which 
denied a stay of the 5th district ruling sought by a lawyer 
representing the rights of the girls fetus to the us supreme 
court which also declined without comment to order enforcement of 
the law 
lawyers had disagreed whether the ruling by the 5th district in 
daytona beach would apply to floridas other four appeal court 
districts as well but franks said the supreme courts decision 
erased all doubt 
he said that under the decision the 15yearold girl can 
legally go ahead with her abortion if she has not already done so 
her lawyer jerri blair of leesburg has repeatedly refused to 
comment on whether the girl has had or plans to have the abortion 
citing her clients right to privacy blair did not return 
telephone calls monday 
gov bob martinez an abortion opponent said he was 
disappointed by the justices decision i would rather have the 
law implemented and carried out as i have supported it in the 
past martinez said 
the girl is identifed in court records only as tw a 
minor the justices ordered the case file sealed to ensure that 
her identity remain a secret 
the case began when tw sought consent from a judge to have an 
abortion telling him she feared physical and emotional abuse from 
her parents if she sought permission from them 
the judge said he was unable to deal with the law as written 
and the consent requirement subsequently was found 
unconstitutionally vague by the 5th district court

while students at centuryold slippery 
rock university treasure their schools funny name university 
officials say it can be a mixed blessing 
some students and faculty came to this state university which 
celebrates its 100th anniversary this year because the quirky name 
attracted their attention 
its a bizarre name said tracy lancia a freshman from 
acton mass who said the name caught her eye on a computer 
printout of schools with strong education programs but if it 
wasnt called this i wouldnt be here 
slippery rock doesnt always conjure up images of lofty 
scholarship however 
were kind of like the advertising jingle where nine out of 10 
people recognize the trade name but they cant tie it to the 
product said charles fouse provost and vice president for 
academic affairs 
the university is battling an image as a party school after a 
recent playboy magazine labeled it that way 
sure there are parties at slippery rock about 50 miles north 
of pittsburgh but theyre no more frequent than at other 
universities a student said 
its just because of the name said danielle lundy 21 a 
senior from williamsport 
the towns creek was named slippery rock after a colonial 
soldier plunged into it when his horse slipped on a rock in 1779 
later when the existence of two neighboring towns called 
centerville caused a mixup in postal deliveries one was renamed 
slippery rock the town has a population of 2000 today 
the name later was passed on to the school 
the name is what drew actor martin sheen to take a detour off 
interstate 79 last month to buy a few slippery rock tshirts 
slippery rock does a brisk business in tshirts according to 
tom mcpherson manager of the universitys book store 
i dont understand it mcpherson said its a common 
name to us but its a fascination a loyal following out there 
there isnt a state in the united states where we havent 
shipped these things

people using wheelchairs can get on the sixth

if they want to get off at the other end 
theres a ramp leading onto the bridge from the citys north 
side but not even a sign warning that on the downtown side those 
in wheelchairs must either jump the curb or ride in traffic 
city traffic engineers say they know of no safe solution 
because cutting into the curb could expose a structural beam 
larry n thomas of the pittsburgh chapter of open doors for the 
handicapped said the matter is being considered by the mayors 
handicapped accessibility committee 
some people said it was the states responsibility some said 
the county or the city now the city is saying its our

higherthanexpected prices for crops and 
livestock have boosted farmers cash income prospects for 1989 by 
at least 2 billion from the forecast of just a month ago an 
agriculture department economist said monday 
in revising the earlier prediction greg hanson of the 
departments economic research service said figures for the fourth 
quarter of 1988 showed that cash receipts for sales of major 
commodities produced on the nations farms were stronger than 
forecast initially and that the momentum continued into the first 
quarter of 1989 
our crop receipts are projected to set an alltime record in 
1989 hanson said in an interview there has been price 
strength in both crops and livestock 
the latest projections put 1989 cash sales of livestock at 
around 81 billion with sales of crops at 76 billion but 
expenses are rising too as farmers put more cropland back into 
production and direct federal payments to farmers decline 
nationally including all farmrelated cash receipts the gross 
cash income of farmers could be in the range of 168 billion to 
173 billion compared with about 170 billion in 1988 expenses 
are forecast at 115 billion to 119 billion compared with 113 
billion last year 
as a result hanson said farmers this year could see net cash 
income in the range of 50 billion to 55 billion that would be 
down from the 1988 record of 577 billion 
just a month ago the agency forecast 1989 net cash income at 
48 billion to 52 billion 
net cash income is the annual difference between gross cash 
income and cash operating expenses as defined by the agency it is 
the amount of money farmers have available to pay debts make 
purchases and pay for family living expenses 
as used by usda economists net cash income during a calendar 
year can include proceeds from sales of crops produced in earlier 
years for example one reason that 1988 net cash income reached a 
high level besides rising commodity prices was that many 
farmers raised cash by selling off grain held from past harvests 
in addition many livestock producers culled herds because they 
lacked the feed and needed the money 
in another method of bookkeeping the agency computes net farm 
income which is a calendar year measure of the net value of 
agricultural production whether sold or stored on the farm 
under this method changes in inventory values are taken into 
consideration along with values assigned to nonmoney income 
such as an allowance for a farm familys dwelling and other factors 
according to usdas latest projections for 1989 net farm income 
could rebound to record level of 47 billion to 52 billion last 
year when inventories were drawn down sharply net farm income was 
about 41 billion down from 463 billion in 1987 
hansons comments followed an outlook report friday in which 
analysts said 1989 aggregate income prospects are not much 
changed from earlier forecasts except that the weather has 
shifted the distributions 
wheat farmers in areas with adequate rainfall or with large 
carryin stocks inventories will have higher incomes because 
prices are up the report said but wheat producers who were 
hit by the dry weather this winter and spring and who lack stocks 
or crop insurance will sustain losses

the world produces more food than it needs 
but neglect complacency and incompetence have left at least half a 
billion people hungry participants in a un conference on hunger 
were told monday 
the world food council a un agency that deals with the 
political aspects of food supplies opened its 15th annual 
conference with conflicting but generally grim assessments on the 
state of hunger in the world 
council chairman eduardo pesqueira of mexico said peace is a 
basic prerequisite to ending worldwide starvation 
wars in central america and africa make their scarce resources 
go to arms rather than food programs detente is important for 
developed and developing countries he said 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar in a statement 
read at the opening of the conference said hunger still can be 
eliminated 
five years ago the council noted that hunger was largely 
a manmade phenomenon human error or neglect created it human 
complacency perpetuated it and human resolve could eradicate it 
the statement said that is equally true today 
pesqueira said comprehensive figures on world hunger are 
difficult to determine the conference heard widely divergent 
figures 
youssef wali egypts deputy prime minister and minister of 
agriculture cited statistics that said 512 million people in the 
world suffer from hunger and that the figure is increasing 
annually by 10 million people 
but ide oumarou secretarygeneral of the organization of 
african unity said in a statement that 800 million people are 
either temporarily or permanently hungry 
he said the world produces 10 percent more food than it needs 
meaning the cause of hunger is a question of distribution and 
imbalances created by international trade not of shortage 
according to world food council reports most malnourished 
people live in asia and africa among seriously troubled countries 
it cited bangladesh bhutan india maldives nepal pakistan and 
sri lanka in asia and ethiopia nigeria zaire tanzania kenya 
uganda and mozambique 
young children pregnant and nursing women and the elderly are 
the most vulnerable to hunger the council says 
it says malnutrition coupled with diarrhea and infectious 
diseases kill an estimated 14 million children under age five every 
year and 83 percent of the malnourished people under five live in 
asia and about 12 percent in subsaharan africa 
the world food council urges help for poor countries to start 
projects to become selfsufficient in food rather than depending 
totally on deliveries of surplus food from richer countries 
the 36member council is to meet for four days during which 
delegates will tour projects north of cairo where large sections of 
desert are being reclaimed for agriculture

a top communist party official with links to two 
controversial criminal investigators has been cleared of bribery 
charges and released from custody tass said monday 
viktor smirnov former secondranking party official in the 
moldavian republic was charged jan 11 with taking bribes 
the weekly moscow news said at the time that smirnov had been 
popular in moldavia where he was sent in 1984 because of his 
activity in an investigation that broke up a chain of corruption in 
the republic of uzbekistan 
that investigation was led by telman gdlyan and nikolai ivanov 
two investigators who tracked a chain of bribery and corruption 
that led to yuri churbanov the soninlaw of former leader leonid 
i brezhnev 
today the case against smirnov was dropped due to the absence 
of facts of the crime and he was released from custody tass 
said 
it said prosecutors apologized to smirnov for the serious 
violations of socialist legality with regard to him on the part of 
officials from the prosecutors office it did not identify the 
officials responsible for arresting him 
gdlyan and ivanov gained wide popularity in the soviet union 
because of their investigation and both won seats in the congress 
of peoples deputies parliament that meets for the first time 
thursday 
but ivanov has been sharply attacked by the kremlin for saying 
in a televised election debate may 12 that the name of politburo 
member yegor k ligachev has come up in his corruption 
investigation the soviet supreme court has ordered an 
investigation of gdlyan because of the jailing of a famous estonian 
scientist who died in prison and later was cleared of charges 
a commission of the presidium of the supreme soviet the 
countrys highest executive body on friday reported systematic 
violations of laws and ethics by gdlyan and ivanov and turned 
their findings over to the soviet procurator generals office 
ligachev has denied any wrongdoing and demanded that results of 
an investigation be made public tass said a statement of his about 
the corruption investigation was read at mondays meeting of the 
partys policymaking central committee it did not provide details 
moscow news on jan 22 said smirnov was one of four delegates to 
the communist party conference in june 1988 that vitaly korotich 
editor of ogonyok identified in a speech as having been implicated 
in taking bribes 
if true that would mean that smirnov was implicated by gdlyan 
and ivanov who wrote the article published by korotichs magazine 
alleging four unidentified delegates to the conference had taken 
bribes 
but ogonyok itself later published the names of four uzbek 
officials that it said had been fired from party jobs or were being 
prosecuted as a result of an investigation started after korotichs 
speech at the party conference 
smirnov resigned his job in moldavia in 1988 tass said fuller 
information about his case would be published later

nevada gov bob miller said his state won 
federal assurance monday that it will be allowed to independently 
assess the suitability of yucca mountain as the nations first 
permanent dump for highlevel nuclear waste 
miller and all four members of the nevada congressional 
delegation met with energy secretary james d watkins at 
departmental headquarters to reiterate their opposition to having 
the dump in their state 
we went into the meeting as opponents of the repository being 
in nevada and we left the meeting with the same opposition 
miller said in an interview 
the department is scheduled to begin its own onsite feasibility 
studies later this year the dump if yucca mountain is deemed a 
suitable site would open in 2003 
miller said watkins pledged that nevada would be given a full 
opportunity to do its own studies of the site about 100 miles 
northwest of las vegas watkins also promised some additional 
funding for the state studies although exact amounts were not 
discussed miller said 
christina sankey a department spokeswoman said watkins office 
had no comment on the meeting 
miller said watkins had given his personal assurance that 
yucca mountain was not a done deal and that the department would 
make a full and objective study of the site before deciding whether 
it would be suitable for holding the waste 
the dump is intended to entomb 70000 tons of highly radioactive 
waste from commercial reactors and from the energy departments 
nuclear weapons plants numerous sites had been under consideration 
early in the decade but in 1987 congress decreed that the search 
would be limited to yucca mountain 
watkins earlier this month said that while he was legally 
obligated to pursuing the yucca mountain program he sympathized 
with the nevada governments misgivings 
miller said he and the nevada congressonal delegation were 
sending a letter to the state senate expressing support for a bill 
that would make it illegal to build a permanent nuclear waste dump 
in nevada the bill passed the state assembly earlier this year and 
has not yet been acted on by the senate

the soviet union ordered the british to reduce 
their moscow employees by nearly half monday in the latest 
expulsion exchange prime minister margaret thatcher said the 
kremlins actions showed that little had changed despite mikhail s 
gorbachevs reforms 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said the 
total number of employees permitted at the british embassy and 
companies would be reduced from 375 to 205 the number of soviets 
permitted to work in britain soviet embassies abroad do not have 
nonsoviet employees 
the latest diplomatic flap began friday when britain ordered 
eight soviet diplomats and three journalists out of the country on 
grounds they were engaged in activities incompatible with their 
status a diplomatic phrase for spying 
moscow called the accusation groundless and retaliated by 
ordering the same number of british diplomats and journalists to 
leave 
it is the largest britishsoviet expulsion exchange in four 
years in 1985 a total of 31 diplomats journalists and other 
representatives were sent home and in 1971 britain expelled 105 
soviets 
gerasimov said he did not know whether the reduction of 170 
people could be accomplished by dismissing soviet employees or 
whether some accredited diplomats journalists and businessmen 
would have to be sent home 
an embassy spokesman said about 150 accredited britons work in 
the soviet union including 68 diplomats 
mrs thatcher said told the bbc monday we gave them the 
chance and they have not taken it and they have revealed their 
true nature 
we had hoped that with a new era dawning in relations that 
with the soviet union taking a different view on many things that 
they might have accepted the expulsions and not retaliated the 
way they did 
were they going to show that things were different or were 
they going to prove by what they did that things really have not 
changed much at all they chose the latter 
sir geoffrey howe the foreign secretary said britain would 
continue working for improved relations but we shall not turn a 
blind eye to unacceptable activity which threatens our national 
security and so the safety of our citizens 
it is because of the continuance of this kind of conduct that 
it is necessary for us to remain vigilant in all respects toward 
the conduct of the soviet union he told the house of commons in 
london 
in october 1986 a similar action during an espionage dispute 
stripped the us embassy of 260 soviet employees american 
diplomats had to shovel snow do their own cooking and otherwise 
fend for themselves until the support employees could be replaced 
by westerners 
the british spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said 
he did not know how many soviet citizens the embassy employed he 
said they handle such nondiplomatic jobs as driving and 
translating 
gerasimov made his announcement at a news conference where 
british correspondents challenged accusations that three of their 
number were spies 
he set the tone of the meeting by saying the soviet side has 
certain information that some uk employees in moscow fulfill the 
orders of secret services 
quentin peel correspondent of the financial times asked 
gerasimov whether he dared repeat the accusation directly to the 
three correspondents are you prepared to accuse our colleagues 
of spying here in front of all their peers he demanded 
the ministry spokesman said only that the expulsion order was 
prepared without his knowledge 
in response to another question gerasimov said he agreed the 
cutback could affect attempts to attract western investment if it 
includes employees of britishsoviet joint ventures 
i will redirect that question to the people who have drawn up 
this text he said 
british companies have formed at least 19 joint ventures with 
soviet enterprises offering badly needed foreign currency 
management expertise and technology 
gerasimov did not say how long the reductions would take who 
would be affected or whether the cuts would be achieved through 
attrition expulsions or withdrawals of employees by government 
order the british spokesman said the embassy would have no comment 
until those matters were clarified 
the disagreement comes at a time of improved relations mrs 
thatcher and gorbachev have a good personal relationship and 
gorbachev received a warm greeting when he visited london early 
this month

federal regulators on monday announced new 
regulations requiring savings institutions to meet more stringent 
standards in documenting their securities activities the latest in 
a series of steps to tighten supervision of the troubled industry 
the federal home loan bank board issued amended regulations 
requiring sampls to report their securities transactions according to 
generally accepted accounting principles and to clearly distinguish 
between those securities held for sale for trading and as 
investments 
paul lockwood a spokesman for the bank board said sampls would 
be able to conduct the same securities transactions as in the past 
but theyve got to account for them in a more realistic sense 
theyve been lumping them all together which makes it very 
hard for auditors or for our own exam staff to get a handle on the 
exact financial picture lockwood said this is just one more 
step of a series that weve taken to tighten up the supervision of 
savings institutions 
a bush administration proposal to restructure the industry and 
rescue depositors with money in insolvent sampls is working its way 
through congress 
brian smith director of regulatory affairs for the us league 
of savings institutions said the bank boards new rules 
establish a much more stringent standard as to when sampls can 
value securities at their higher historical costs versus market 
value which could be lower 
sampls would have to hold securities through thick or thin to 
maturity in order to value them for accounting purposes at the 
higher level smith said 
the bank boards action requires an sampls board of directors to 
adopt an investment policy on securities and to monitor the 
institutions compliance with that strategy management meanwhile 
will be responsible for carrying out securities transactions that 
comply with the investment policies 
lockwood said the rules would help federal regulators assess the 
financial status of sampls and help thrift managers have a better 
handle on their own situation 
smith said the new rules could reduce sampls flexibility in 
deciding whether to sell off or hold on to securities if 
securities were classified as a longterm investment institutions 
wouldnt be able to switch course and just get rid of it if they 
dont like it he said

a convicted robber who escaped and created 
a new life for herself during 10 years of freedom should be granted 
a pardon because of her extraordinary success rehabilitating 
herself her attorney contends 
the state department of probation parole and pardon services 
will hear the case for pardoning kay smith 37 on tuesday mrs 
smith who was recaptured because of a tip from her exhusband 
would be the first inmate to be pardoned since at least the 1940s 
for any reason other than terminal illness 
in south carolina pardons can be granted only by a special 
board and before it will consider a hearing five of the seven 
members must vote to approve an investigation 
it is very rare that inmates request pardon hearings board 
spokesman david allen said 
in 1975 mrs smith then known as pamela rodgers was convicted 
in south carolina on five counts of armed robbery and sentenced to 
12 years in prison she walked away from a work release program in 
1978 and hitchhiked to maryland 
during the next decade she earned her high school diploma 
overcame drug and alcohol abuse married ray smith raised a foster 
child and two sons and became a successful real estate agent 
her story is the most extraordinary story any of us has ever 
heard about someone who has ever rehabilitated herself said 
richard harpootlian her attorney in columbia 
someone who was convicted of several armed robberies and a 
drug problem on the run took herself and pulled herself up by her 
bootstraps to become a productive member of society 
mrs smiths happy life ended in may 1988 when her previous 
husband convicted of murder in idaho tipped authorities to her 
whereabouts mrs smith was returned to south carolina to finish 
her original prison sentence and one additional year for escape 
under an interstate agreement mrs smith was transferred last 
fall to the womens correctional institution in jessup md so she 
could be closer to home 
theres no reason for her being in there other than just 
punishment her husband said in a telephone interview from his 
home in severn md shes made changes in her life and it hasnt 
cost anyone anything except her 
smith 40 said he and the couples two teenage sons from mrs 
smiths previous marriage would be at the hearing in columbia 
mrs smith was unlikely to be allowed to attend because the 
board did not request her presence said her attorney in baltimore 
john hassett 
despite the lack of precedent hassett said he was optimistic 
i spoke to her on friday and she and her family are also 
extremely optimistic he said dick harpootlian and i both 
believe weve put her case in the best possible posture for 
consideration 
should the pardon request be refused mrs smith will be 
eligible for parole in april

hundreds of workers cheered 
opposition leaders who defied a government ban on demonstrations 
and appeared monday at factories to seek support for their claim to 
the presidency 
the oppositions three top candidates seeking recognition of 
their victory in the may 7 general election shook hands and passed 
out leaflets welcoming a delegation from the organization of 
american states due tuesday 
the oas will not solve all our problems but it will create 
the environment they have come to investigate said presidential 
candidate guillermo endara workers greeted him at factories in 
panama city with chants of endara is my president and 
justice justice 
international observers say the opposition won the elections by 
a 31 margin the government and its de facto ruler gen manuel 
antonio noriega nullified the vote after it was apparent their 
candidates were losing 
monday was the third straight day that endara and his two vice 
presidential candidates ricardo arias calderon and guillermo ford 
defied the ban on demonstrations that will last until the oas 
delegation files its report june 5 
the delegation is made up of the foreign ministers of ecuador 
guatemala and trinidad and tobago and oas secretarygeneral joao 
baena soares 
a progovernment party monday criticized the oas for adopting a 
resolution condemning noriega and said its delegation could not 
mediate among panamanians 
we call on the oas to adopt a virile attitude toward 
aggression against our people by the united states said a 
statement issued by the revolutionary democratic party the largest 
progovernment group 
after touring factories monday endara said we want a 
transfer of power from the defense forces to a civilian 
government 
noriega holds power because he commands the defense forces he 
has been indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in the united 
states but says the charges are part of a us plot to retain 
control of the panama canal due to be turned over to panama at the 
end of 1999 
us troops sent to augment security at us canal installations 
continued exercises monday including special jungle training and 
live firing 
on monday the opposition candidates pursued by a caravan of 
journalists left party headquarters without revealing their exact 
destination 
ford said the opposition is not calling for large announced 
demonstrations in order to avoid butchery 
were going to visit all 2 million of our supporters one by 
one ford said after sharing a cup of coffee with a few workers 
panama has a population of about 25 million 
on may 10 paramilitary noriega supporters attacked opposition 
candidates leaving a bodyguard dead and endara and ford bloodied 
crowds were small but enthusiastic monday at a panama beer 
brewery workers came running from the far ends of the plant 
at one stop the candidates put on work gloves and gathered 
around a grinding machine that endara an enthusiastic campaigner 
adjusted without being entirely certain of the results 
by the end of the trip to a dozen factories including such 
usassociated plants as cocacola general mills and 
colgatepalmolive endaras collar was covered with lipstick 
only a few police officers were visible as the caravan wound 
through a panama city industrial park most officers were directing 
traffic 
since the may 10 attack the government has sharply reduced 
police presence emboldening opponents despite a general strike 
that fizzled last week 
at a kraft cheese plant one worker snatched a leaflet from 
another and said thats not for toads to read 
members of the governments extensive network of informers are 
called toads the man who had been called a toad retreated

question whats 3 feet long weighs 35 
pounds and lives on 5 pounds of smelt a day plus nearly 5000 
worth of assorted exotic saltwater fish answer the grouper that 
ate terry haleys pet store aquarium 
day after day he got progressively larger and our inventory of 
fish got progressively lower said haley owner of terrys 
aquarium amp pet center 
the spotted jewfish a type of grouper was purchased for 150 
and arrived at a petite one foot long and 3 pounds just 18 months 
ago it was caught off the florida keys 
haley put it in the stores 1100gallon saltwater show tank 
which once contained about 75 fish 
groupers are known to prey on smaller fish but haley thought he 
could control what it ate by hand feeding it 
that didnt work 
hes eaten everything in the aquarium haley said monday 
from his store in this southern chicago suburb thats about 
3000 to 5000 worth of fish 
its also the last straw for haley who said he plans to ship 
the fish back to its native environment where it can swim for its 
own supper 
the fish is fed 5 pounds of smelt a day but the list of its a 
la carte snacks from among its tankmates is impressive 
in the last six months the grouper ate a clown trigger fish 
worth 600 two imperator angels worth about 250 each two queen 
angels worth 150 each one blue racer worth 50 and 50 yellow 
tangs worth 20 each 
haley said he gave little thought to placing the expensive clown 
trigger in the tank because groupers have not been known to include 
them in their diet but it didnt stop the grouper which experts 
say can grow to as much as 8 feet 
its in there for a day and turns into food he said 
thinking a swift fish would be safe from the lumbering groupers 
jaws haley placed a 12inch blue racer in the tank 
the racer was in there about a month he said the grouper 
just lay there and waited it raced too slow one day and he was 
gone 
in fact the grouper has devoured everything except a couple of 
6foot moray eels and a nurse shark but not for lack of trying 
we came in one morning and it had the shark in its mouth about 
halfway down he said we beat him with a broom handle and he 
spit him out 
haley bought the fish from noyes marine life an aquarium 
supplier in fort lauderdale fla and plans to return it to the sea 
off that city on july 5 the fish will be flown to florida and 
released by divers he said adding that he doesnt know yet how 
much that will cost 
haley offered the grouper to zoos and the shedd aquarium in 
chicago but they said there was no room the owners of a nearby 
restaurant had another idea 
theyd put their hands up to the tank and measure him and 
smile he said they were really eying him up but i cant 
imagine anybody having our fish for dinner

gods little onesixtyninth of an acre is now 
available to sunloving cityslickers for 38682 the catch its 
a slab of rooftop 
the idea developed out of my own observation of the 
marketplace and the general high demand for outside space that most 
apartment buyers prefer said sheldon stein vice president of 
jacob holm inc a development company 
stein decided to divide the roof of a greenwich village building 
into 14 patio spaces and sell them to people who first buy a oneto 
fourroom apartment in the building for 130000 to 212000 
new york unlike most cities has few park spaces or open 
areas and apartments are smaller which makes new yorkers desire a 
little more freedom he said monday 
escape to this roof to view the hudson river to the west 
midtown manhattan to the north and wall street to the south this 
building is a story or two taller than its neighbors and zoning 
restrictions have kept skyscrapers at bay 
on the roof 12894 plus a monthly maintenance of 4284 gets 
you 235 square feet of tar beach with lights and running water 
enclosed by a 6foothigh fence 
big spenders can pay 38682 for 625 square feet or just over 
169th of an acre with a maintenance charge of 12852 60 
percent tax deductible 
a 10footwide common area will be decorated with plants 
we wanted to give it a feeling of graciousness so that people 
werent being corralled said stein 
security will be provided so that no one steals lawn chairs or 
exercise bicycles 
one guy may have dinner there another may have a garden and 
one may fly a kite said stein on the issue of barbecuing 
wed rather not discuss it technically its primarily for 
sunbathing 
the management company has just started advertising the 
apartments the 300 people who called last weekend were told about 
the added incentive of a rooftop coop and some of them seemed 
interested said stein 
in a city where parking spaces and yacht slips already are sold 
for hefty prices is there any limit to the type of property that 
can turn coop 
im a real estate man thats a broad question said stein 
who once dreamed that coop car ownership would be the way to 
go

rep tony coelho the house democratic whip 
supplemented his salary by giving speeches and collecting rent on 
property in california his financial disclosure forms showed 
monday 
the lawmakers income ranged from 123525 to 136025 in 1988 
his base salary was 89500 boosted by rents of 5000 to 
15000 honoraria after charitable donations of 26525 and 
interest from a federal credit union of 2500 to 5000 
coelho whose personal finances have recently drawn public 
attention because of what he said was an error in his 1986 
financial disclosure form put most of his assets in a qualified 
blind trust in june 1988 
at the time the california democrats holdings were worth 
65000 to 150000 with the largest investment a rental duplex 
in merced calif valued at 50000 to 150000 
the assets that coelho kept out of the blind trust include 
another rental property in merced valued at 50000 to 100000 
and savings accounts money market accounts and individual 
retirements accounts worth 25000 to 80000 
coelho listed no purchases or sale of property stocks or bonds 
in 1988 but he did refinance his principal residence in the 
virginia suburbs 
that arrangement allowed him in october to pay off loans of 
80000 to 200000 the forms show coelho satisfied a commercial 
loan of 50000 to 100000 from federal city national bank a 
15000 to 50000 line of credit from security pacific national 
bank and the same line of credit from wells fargo bank 
coelho also sent his trustee i barry mehler a check for 
60000 for inclusion in his blind trust last november according 
to an amendment filed to his 1987 financial disclosure he did not 
say where the money came from his aides said they would ask 
excluding his blind trust coelho was left with one liability a 
50000 to 100000 mortgage on his merced rental house from the 
tracy savings and loan institution 
under the 1978 ethics in government act lawmakers are not 
required to reveal any details of transactions dealing with their 
principal residence 
another exemption is details of a spouses income coelhos 
wife phyllis works as an assistant to rep andrew jacobs dind 
coelho a top fundraiser for the democratic party and former 
head of the democratic congressional campaign committee was an 
active speaker on the lecture circuit last year collecting 
honoraria of 90100 he gave 63575 to charity keeping 26525 
a few hundred dollars short of the maximum allowed 
among those who gave coelho 2000 for speaking was drexel 
burnham lambert a brokerage house that also picked up the tab for 
coelho to fly from iowa to los angeles 
the washington post has reported that coehlo had not listed on 
his 1986 disclosure forms a loan he obtained to buy 100000 in 
highyield drexel burnham junk bonds coelho blamed the omission of 
an oversight by his california accountant 
coelho a member of the house agriculture committee accepted 
speaking fees from a number of groups that could have potential 
business before the panel 
they included the california grocers association the american 
horse council the fertilizer institute and the connell rice and 
sugar co 
coelho did a fair amount of traveling at other peoples expense 
to give speeches in 1988 sometimes the destinations were resorts 
but the only overseas trip was five days he spent in israel on a 
trip paid for by project interchange 
the congressman and his wife spent two nights at marco island 
fla paid for by puccio and associates he visited palm springs 
calif two times at the invitation of the mexicanamerican grocers 
association and the tobacco institute and spent three days in 
yosemite national park on a factfinding trip paid for by the 
yosemite park and curry co 
coelho who suffers from epilepsy traveled to new york once and 
california three times for the epilesy foundation of america he 
also visited texas california and new york for the tony coelho

the white house tried to talk down the value 
of the dollar monday coupling a rare public statement on the 
subject with apparent federal reserve action in an effort to head 
off further foreign trade problems 
there was no indication of much quick impact analysts said 
the white house statement read by deputy press secretary roman 
popadiuk said if the dollars recent rise against other major 
currencies is sustained for a prolonged period or extended it 
could undermine international efforts to reduce global trade 
imbalances 
the statement marking the first time the white house has 
commented directly on the dollar since president bush took office 
was accompanied by a new federal reserve selloff of dollars in 
international currency markets traders and analysts said 
and it followed hectic trading in european markets with the 
federal reserve and the central banks of japan west germany 
britain and other major european allies reportedly selling millions 
of dollars in an attempt to break the currencys surge 
a high value for the dollar makes imported goods less expensive 
in the united states and us products more expensive abroad 
aggravating the us trade deficit the recent rebound of the 
dollars value abroad could undo recent improvements in the 
nations trade accounts economists suggested 
despite massive intervention by central banks particularly the 
bank of japan the value of the dollar abroad has continued to 
surge in recent weeks 
david wyss chief financial economist at data resources inc 
said the federal reserve the us central bank began selling off 
dollars about the time of the white house statement it was 
calculated to have a combined impact unfortunately the market is 
shrugging it off 
the federal reserve does not comment publicly on its buying and 
selling activities in financial markets 
the white house statement said the climbing dollar is a matter 
of concern that has also prompted questioning of the 
administrations commitment to the process of economic policy 
coordination among the group of seven major industrial 
democracies 
this administration remains fully committed to this process 
the statement continued 
it referred to a pact among united states britain japan 
france west germany italy and canada to take steps to coordinate 
their economic policies including interest rate changes and 
direct intervention in exchange markets to keep major currencies 
stable 
popadiuk declined to elaborate on the statement saying it spoke 
for itself the president and the secretary of the treasury 
remain the administrations sole spokesmen on the dollar and 
exchange rate policy he said 
the white house statement said we will continue our efforts 
to strengthen underlying policies that promote the adjustment of 
external imbalances as well as cooperating in exchange markets as 
agreed in the april 7 g7 communique 
the statement couched in the language of international finance 
amounted to a public assertion that the bush administration 
supported additional intervention by central banks to break the 
dollars rise 
since the white house usually does not make such comments the 
statement appeared designed largely for its psychological impact on 
traders analysts suggested 
the dollar is getting out of hand so they had to do 
something but theyre going to have to back it up with action to 
spend billions to move dollars around said michael k evans 
president of evans economics a washingtonbased consulting firm 
even an increase in a key interest rate last month by west 
germanys central bank a move that would usually help weaken the 
dollar failed to have much impact on the dollars rise 
higher interest rates abroad and lower interest rates in the 
united states should also help to drive down the dollar 
mondays statement thus reinforces previous administration 
efforts to prod the federal reserve into lowering interest rates 
the dollar steadied at higher levels in europe on monday but 
dealers said that heavy repeated central bank intervention had had 
little impact 
the dollar pushed through the twowest german mark level early 
in the european day for the first time since december 1986 
international finance sources have said that level and one of 
140 yen to the dollar are the upper thresholds in exchangerate 
ranges agreed to privately by the seven industrial democracies 
the rise in the dollar above that threshold apparently helped to 
trigger mondays white house statement

college students are testing positive for the 
aids virus more frequently than expected but at a lower rate than 
the population as a whole researchers said monday 
a survey by the american college health association and the 
centers for disease control showed that 30 of the 16861 students 
who sought medical attention in their campus health centers tested 
positive for the aids virus for a rate of 02 percent 
nationwide researchers believe 1 million to 15 million people 
are infected a rate of 04 percent to 06 percent 
the study is the nations first survey attempting to determine 
the prevalence of aids among college students 
the testing was done anonymously and results were not broken 
out for the 19 campuses selected to represent a cross section of 
higher education in the united states 
of the 30 students who tested hiv positive all but two were 
male officials did not release the gender breakdown of those 
tested 
no student tested positive at 10 of the schools while five of 
the schools had rates of 04 percent or higher the highest campus 
rate was 09 percent 
richard keeling director of student health services at the 
university of virginia and president of the american college health 
association said the 02 percent rate is higher than health 
officials had projected they had expected it would have been 
closer to the rate for military recruits 
keeling said his advice to college students is that 
uninformed unprotected unsober sexual activity is highly 
risky 
his message to the campuses is that they must be more aggressive 
about aids education working with students in small groups and 
asking sensitive questions like what do you say to him when he 
says he wont wear a condom 
he said college health services must start offering more hiv 
services including testing and care for those who test positive 
including close medical surveillance of their immune systems a 
majority of college health services do not provide testing for hiv 
infection and only a small number offer anonymous testing he said 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
fatal disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections spread 
through contact with blood and semen of infected people its chief 
victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users a 
small percentage of cases have been caused by transfusions of 
contaminated blood heterosexual contact and spread from infected 
pregnant women to their offspring 
the survey was restricted to students who had routine blood 
tests done at their student health centers and keeling said it was 
not clear to researchers whether the sample may be overestimating 
or underestimating the prevalence of the disease on the campuses 
helene gayle an epidemiologist at the centers for disease 
control who worked on the survey said it is intended to give an 
indication of the magnitude of the aids problem on college campuses 
and is not an exact figure 
the association said it will continue the study during the next 
academic year and wants include several more schools including 
historically black institutions and some with predominantly 
hispanic students

by shrinking tumors with medicine before 
surgery doctors may be able to eliminate most mastectomies as the 
standard treatment for breast cancer a leading cancer researcher 
said monday 
dr gianni bonadonna of the national cancer institute of italy 
said his study showed that the new approach could eliminate the 
need for mastectomies in 87 percent of women who otherwise would 
have had this mutilating surgery 
in recent years doctors have slowly switched to removing just 
the lump not the whole breast when the tumor is small however 
this conservative surgery is not usually considered possible when 
tumors are large 
the latest strategy involves shrinking big tumors first with 
chemotherapy so they are small enough to be taken out with a 
breastsaving operation called a lumpectomy which generally leaves 
about threequarters of the breast intact the chemotherapy is the 
same as that commonly used after surgery 
the procedure was outlined by bonadonna at the annual meeting of 
the american society of clinical oncology 
bonadonna predicted that by 1994 the 100th anniversary of the 
radical mastectomy this common operation will be very very 
rare 
surgeons frequently recommend against trying to spare breasts 
containing larger tumors because too little healthy tissue is left 
to save and because they fear the cancer will be more likely to 
spread to other parts of the body 
so far bonadonna and colleagues in italy have used the new 
procedure on 97 patients beginning in january 1988 although none 
of their cancers have returned other experts caution that much 
longer followup will be necessary to know whether this approach is 
as good as mastectomies at saving lives 
despite recent studies showing that for small tumors at least 
breastsparing surgery appears to be safe some physicians remain 
skeptical 
i think there is still a lot of place for mastectomy 
because the chances of cure may be better commented dr hendre 
falkson of the university of pretoria in south africa 
while cautious some other physicians said they found 
bonadonnas findings intriguing 
this challenges the conventional treatment said dr nikolay 
dimitrov of michigan state university it may provide a 
revolutionary change in the treatment of breast cancer 
added dr jules harris of rush cancer in chicago i think its 
interesting and exciting and will give rise to a great deal of 
clinical investigation 
breast cancer is the leading cancer killer of women in the 
united states the disease strikes one in 10 women at some time 
during their lives and caused 42000 deaths last year 
in bonadonnas study chemotherapy was given to women whose 
breast tumors were bigger than three centimeters or just over one 
inch the drugs could bring them down below three centimeters in 87 
percent of the women 
the largest tumor was over four inches across and was shrunken 
small enough so doctors could perform a lumpectomy the average 
size of the tumors before treatment was two inches 
after the operations the doctors treated the women with 
radiation therapy and additional chemotherapy

officials of the shoshone national forest are 
trying to find ways to teach grizzly bears to avoid humans and plan 
to see if a russian breed of dog used by bear hunters will do the 
trick 
wyoming game and fish department biologists have been 
experimenting with bear aversion techniques in recent years and 
this year will continue testing a thumper gun that fires 
plastic bullets to see if that will teach grizzlies to avoid people 
but recently us forest service officials received permission 
to see if russian bear dogs a breed rare in this country can be 
used to scare off bears 
the russian hounds were not available in the past because 
neither the soviet union nor finland where they are trained to 
hold a bear at bay until a hunter arrives would export the 
animals but soviet restrictions have been loosened under the 
glasnost campaign and some of the dogs have found their way to the 
united states 
monte barker a forest service wildlife biologist said the dogs 
now in this country havent been trained as bear dogs but hes 
confident they could be 
the small quick dogs have been used primarily for bear hunting 
and protection in the soviet union where they are trained with 
european brown bears he said 
the dogs characteristics include fearlessness courageousness 
speed and a highlydeveloped sense of smell 
near as i can tell it has the best nose of any dog there 
is barker said 
a proposal approved by the management subcommittee of the 
interagency grizzly bear committee calls for barker to collect 
information on the dogs and try to get owners to bring the animals 
to the shoshone forest

india launched on monday a rocket named 
agni the sanskrit word for fire and became only the seventh 
nation to develop a ballistic missile of its own 
the missile has a range of more than 1500 miles enough to 
reach targets as far away as iran in the west hong kong in the 
east china to the north and islands around the equator to the 
south western military officials said 
it can also hit any target in neighboring pakistan with whom 
india has fought three wars since they became independent of 
britain in 1947 
military officials reached by telephone said the missile was 
launched monday at chandipur 750 miles southeast of new delhi 
by successfully firing the missile india joined the united 
states soviet union britain china france and israel in 
developing its own such weapon 
mondays test was for a range up to about 620 miles the 
military officials said on condition of anonymity one said the 
guiding system not the range was the most implortant factor in 
the test 
agni is not a weapons system prime minister rajiv gandhi 
said in a statement however the technologies proved in agni are 
deeply significant for evolving national security options 
he said the missile accurately followed a predetermined flight 
path and fully met the objectives we had set for it he did not 
say how far the rocket traveled 
it was the third attempt to launch the agni missile the first 
launch date april 20 was set back by problems with the ignition 
system a second date may 1 was scrubbed because of an error in a 
subsystem 
western military experts said the 1ton payload capability means 
the 75ton agni could carry a nuclear warhead but gandhi denied 
the possibility was being considered 
what agni does is to afford us the option of developing the 
ability to deliver nonnuclear weapons with high precision at long 
ranges he said this provides us with a viable nonnuclear 
option of the greatest relevance to contemporary strategic 
doctrines 
defense experts say a sophisticated guiding system would not be 
needed for the missile to deliver a nuclear charge 
you need accuracy or a point target if you are using a 
conventional warhead a western analyst said privately but if 
you are using a nuclear warhead the exact target does not matter i 
am not saying that the indians are going to use a nuclear warhead 
but the question is why not 
india exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago and western nuclear 
experts believe its scientists can assemble an atomic weapon in a 
week 
the government says its nuclear program is for such nonmilitary 
purposes as power generation and firing the missile was only a 
demonstration of the countrys capabilities 
agni is the fourth missile india has developed since 1983 three 
surfacetosurface and surfacetoair missiles with ranges of 20 to 
about 150 miles also have been testfired

world tea production last year climbed to a 
record 242 million metric tons up 3 percent from 1987 the 
agriculture department said monday 
the bumper harvest resulted from favorable growing conditions 
and new plantings coming into production in several countries the 
departments foreign agricultural service said in a report 
larger crops were reported for india sri lanka china kenya 
and malawi tea output in mozambique and uganda remained at low 
levels reflecting unstable political and economic conditions 
the report said 
further tea production in some areas of the soviet union 
continue to be affected by the 1986 a chernobyl nuclear plant 
accident the report said consequently the soviets have had to 
increase imports to meet domestic requirements 
us tea imports in 1988 increased 16 percent to 90144 tons 
valued at 129 million even so last years increase to replenish 
inventories left 1988 total tea imports slightly below the 1986 
level of 90549 tons valued at 1336 million the report said 
preliminary data indicate that us retail food store tea 
sales continued to fall in 1988 as consumers showed their 
preference for soft drinks fruit juices and alcoholic beverages 
the report said however sales of herbal teas were higher after 
showing signs of toppingout over the past several years

federal parks along americas seashores are 
facing environmental threats ranging from oil spills to the 
increasing use of allterrain recreational vehicles the wilderness 
society said monday in a report on 31 coastal parks 
the conservation group noted the devastation of federal park 
beaches from the oil spill in alaska but said other coastal parks 
also are fending off a distressing variety of threats that 
eventually may overwhelm them 
among the problems facing these parklands are 
tons of garbage and other ocean debris washing ashore on 
federal searshores and parks each year including medical wastes 
and unmarked chemical drums 
pressure for offshore oil development near the federal land 
wastewater pollution from nearby agriculture or urban 
development 
the increasing use by park visitors of allterrain vehicles 
that damages dunes and wildlife habitat 
developers who aggressively are buying private parcels of land 
within some of the parks while the government is unable to compete 
for the parcels because of budget constraints 
the report by the conservation group said there are no signs the 
problems facing the coastal parks will ease 
tomorrow the problems facing our coastal parks will be more 
serious than they are today unless additional measures are taken 
to better protect these stretches of federal seashore the 
wilderness society report said 
the coastal parks and seashore areas examined were acadia in

hungarys foreign minister on monday 
said imre nagy and fellow martyrs who led the failed 1956 
revolt against stalinism were victims of show trials 
another senior communist urged the political and legal 
rehabilitation of nagy and his associates captured and executed in 
1958 after soviet tanks and troops violently crushed the 
shortlived 1956 revolt 
the statements reflected growing demands for nagys 
rehabilitation before june 16 the 31st anniversary of his 
execution and public questioning of the role of former leader 
janos kadar in nagys demise 
the state news agency mti quoted foreign minister gyula horn as 
saying monday that it can be unequivocally stated that former 
premier imre nagy and his fellow martyrs became the victims of 
politically inspired show trials 
his statement before about 400 communists and nonparty members 
at a meeting in the northeastern city of eger followed a weekend 
demand from 400 communist reformers for nagy to be rehabilitated 
politically 
central committee secretary matyas szueros was quoted monday in 
the communist party daily nepszabadsag as saying we definitely 
have to come to terms with the meaning of 1956 and the role of imre 
nagy and his associates 
there is a need for their political and legal rehabilitation 
as well as for the reinstatement of their human dignity szueros 
was quoted as saying on italian television saturday night 
a government commission is investigating the trial of nagy and 
other revolt leaders who may be legally rehabilitated when the 
probe is completed political rehabilitation would require the 
hungarian socialist workers communist party to revise its 
official version of hungarys history 
kadar 76 has come under increasing fire since losing the party 
leadership a year ago monday this month the partys central 
committee stripped him of his last political posts and said serious 
mistakes had been committed in his 32year rule 
kadar came to power at the end of the revolt when nagy and 
leading associates were captured and imprisoned they were executed 
after summary trials in june 1958 on charges of counterrevolution 
previously buried in unmarked graves in a remote corner of a 
budapest cemetery they are to be reburied at a june 16 ceremony 
expected to draw tens of thousands of sympathizers and to be

the agriculture department said monday that it 
will crackdown on the testing and detention of readytoeat meat 
and poultry products suspected of being contaminated by the 
bacteria listeria monocytogenes 
lester m crawford head of the departments food safety and 
inspection service said the new policy will take effect as soon as 
the revised testing procedures are ready in about six weeks 
crawford said that on april 14 the centers for disease control 
confirmed the first case of human listeriosis in the united 
states caused by meat or poultry the case involved a nationwide 
recall of turkey franks made by plantation foods inc waco texas 
we have responded by intensifying our sampling and compliance 
policy to ensure that readytoeat products contaminated with 
listeria monocytogenes do not reach consumers crawford said 
under the listeria monitoring program the agency will increase 
the number of samples tested each year other procedures are being 
put into effect to ensure that suspected products will not reach 
consumers until the problem has been protected he said 
listeria is difficult to control because it can grow slowly on 
foods under refrigeration crawford said the bacteria have the 
potential to cause serious illness particularly among those with 
weakened immune systems such as infants pregnant women the 
elderly and the chronically ill 
however he said healthy people are essentially at little 
risk from the disease which can cause flulike symptoms 
including fever chills headaches and sometimes abdominal pain and 
diarrhea

president bush on monday said the united 
states wont consider improving relations with cuba unless it makes 
democratic reforms and frees political prisoners 
bush called on cuban president fidel castro to reject the soviet 
military presence hold a national plebiscite free all political 
prisoners allow free emigration and grant unrestricted access to 
international human rights monitoring groups 
i am unalterably committed to a free united and democratic 
cuba and i will never falter in that support bush said in 
remarks before a group brought to the white house to recognize the 
cuban holiday celebrating independence from spain 
he accused castro of squelching basic rights such as freedom of 
religion assembly and speech 
in response our demand is plain and simple democracy and 
respect for human rights not sometimes not someday but now 
bush said castro should free all political prisoners and to 
conform to accepted international standards regarding human rights 
i challenge him to allow unrestricted access to the united nations 
and other organizations monitoring their compliance and a policy 
of nonintervention in the internal affairs of other states 
bushs tone contrasted with the restraint he has used in talking 
about the prodemocracy demonstrations rocking china 
in his speech bush mentioned china in passing saying it is 
important that the people of cuba know the truth and we will see 
that the people of cuba do know the truth about their dicator and 
about the world 
and totalitarian systems everywhere are feeling new pressures 
from the people you see it today on the televisions sets coming 
out of china weve seen the those beginnings of it in the soviet 
union and many many other countries around the world 
bush said he was challenging castro to take concrete and 
specific steps leading to free and fair elections and full 
democracy a useful first step would be to accept a proposed 
plebiscite in cuba 
havana has not responded to international calls for a plebiscite 
in which the cuban people could vote for or against the communist 
government that was installed when the castroled revolution came 
to power in 1959 
this i pledge bush said unless fidel castro is willing 
to change his policies and behavior we will maintain our present 
policy toward cuba 
bush referred to speculation that the change in administrations 
in washington this year might be an opening for a more relaxed 
attitude toward cuba after the long chill in relations 
knock off this wild speculation as just that some suggesting 
that our administration is going to unitlaterally shift things with 
fidel castro i am not going to do that bush said 
bush said us opposition to cubas reentry into the 
organization of american states would continue unless castro 
changed his policies and he vowed to continue beaming radio 
broadcasts into cuba via the usgovernment radio marti 
in short what we want to do is to advance that day when cuban 
independence day achieves a new and a richer meaning freedom from 
the evil of tyranny and oppression freedom from the economic 
misery wrought by the communist rule he said 
in february a united nations team that visited cuba last 
september reported on allegations of human rights abuses which the 
government denied 
the investigating team said it received more than 1600 human 
rights complaints from cuban prisoners including 137 of torture 
cruel inhuman or degrading treatment

british ambassador allan ramsay appealed 
on television monday for the release of 75yearold briton jack 
mann a world war ii pilot believed kidnapped in moslem west beirut 
10 days ago 
my government does not make deals with hostageholders 
ramsay said speaking in arabic over the christianrun lebanese 
broadcasting corp network 
there must be something wrong with the mentality of those who 
kidnap an old gentleman of 75 years of age to accomplish certain 
objectives he said 
theres no way any gains would be won from such an abduction 
mann disappeared may 13 and a group calling itself the cells of 
armed struggle later claimed it had kidnapped an unidentified 
briton 
ramsay indicated he believed the briton held was mann who has 
lived in west beirut with his wife sunny for more than 40 years 
the cells of armed struggle demanded release of unidentified 
prisoners it claims are held in britain in connection with the 1987 
murder of leftist palestinian cartoonist naji ali in london 
scotland yard said no one was detained or charged with the slaying 
ramsay said mann and all other foreign hostages held in lebanon 
should be freed unconditionally besides mann 17 others are 
missing nine americans three other britons two west germans an 
irishman an italian and a belgian 
the longest held hostage is american terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped 
march 16 1985 
pope john paul ii meanwhile appealed in a letter to 16 heads of 
state and the un secretarygeneral for steps to prevent the 
destruction that threatens lebanon the vatican said monday 
the pope said the violence wracking lebanon was linked to the 
intervention of armed forces of neighboring countries and was 
the responsibility of the entire international society 
he did not mention specific countries but among heads of state 
receiving the letter were leaders of syria and israel who have had 
forces in lebanon

egyptian president hosni mubarak 
arrived monday and received a warm embrace from moroccos king 
hassan ii that ended the arab leagues 10year ostracism of cairo 
the 22member league holds a special summit starting tuesday 
and libyas moammar gadhafi hinted that he dropped his plans to 
boycott the meeting despite his opposition to mubaraks presence 
his statement came after he met with other arab leaders in 
tripoli on monday 
as a 21gun salute boomed hassan wearing a traditional white 
djellaba cloak and red fez hugged mubarak who wore a western 
business suit 
although differences remain over lebanon palestine and other 
issues moroccan foreign minister abdellatif filali called egypts 
readmission an important historic event that will boost arab 
solidarity 
egypts membership was suspended in 1979 after the late 
president anwar sadat signed the camp david peace accords with 
israel 
the official libyan news agency jana monitored in rome said 
gadhafi reached agreement with the leaders of algeria syria and 
tunisia to oppose any concession at the arab summit and to 
boycott it if there was any hint of recognizing israel 
algerias chadli bendjedid syrias hafez assad and tunisias 
zine abidine ben ali flew to tripoli early monday to persuade 
gadhafi to change his mind about skipping the meeting 
later monday gadhafi flew to the western algerian city of oran 
where he was to meet again tuesday with the three presidents 
libyan television reported it was not clear whether the summit 
would be delayed by gadhafis meetings tuesday 
the lebanese chair may stay vacant because of the dispute 
between christian leader gen michel aoun and moslem acting prime 
minister salim hoss their governments have been competing for 
legitimacy since september when parliament failed to elect a 
successor to president amin gemayel 
a ministerial subcommittee on lebanon met sunday and monday but 
failed to resolve the bitter quarrel 
syria the main power broker in lebanon initially insisted only 
hoss attend iraq syrias main arab rival and aouns only 
outspoken arab backer threatened to walk out if only hoss were 
invited a conference source said 
the source said syria and iraq reluctantly agreed the summit 
should ask both men to express their views but neither would be 
considered the official representative of lebanon 
a second ministerial subcommittee met to consider rival working 
papers on the palestinian issue submitted by syria and yasser 
arafats palestine liberation organisation 
the plo paper complained arab states have failed to pay promised 
donations of a onetime lump sum of 128 million followed by 43 
million a month to support the uprising in israelioccupied 
territory 
a plo spokesman said only saudi arabia and libya have paid a 
total of 52 million he said a possible cause was arafats 
recognition of israel and renunciation of terrorism 
the preparatory committee agreed to a compromise between the plo 
and syrian positions drafted by egypt it was the first substantive 
egyptian contribution to the arab league since 1979

ending the dispute between the united 
states and west germany over shortrange nuclear weapons depends on 
the timing of ussoviet negotiations on the devices officials 
said monday 
most of natos shortrange nuclear warheads are deployed in west 
germany and west germany has been insisting on prompt superpower 
talks on the weapons 
the united states has taken the stand that such talks cannot 
begin until the soviets make substantial reductions in conventional 
weapons in europe 
diplomatic sources in bonn speaking on condition of anonymity 
said both sides have a along way to go in resolving the 
conflict before a north atlantic treaty organization summit opens 
may 29 
progress has already been made because the united states is no 
longer rejecting outright the notion of the talks one source 
said we still have to work out the timing of when talks should 
begin 
he said west germany seeks a compromise with language making it 
clear that the talks would begin within the foreseeable future 
and not next century 
that is in line with west germanys position that progress in 
conventionalarms negotiations with the soviets in vienna should 
lead quickly to talks on the shortrange nuclear devices 
chief government spokesman hans klein said monday discussions 
with the united states are centered on conditions for the beginning 
of such talks 
a us compromise accepting the talks in principle is coupled 
with a demand that west germany drop its insistence on prompt 
talks 
klein was asked about that and he said the word prompt can 
have a broad interpretation he declined to elaborate 
he said chancellor helmut sent a letter to president bush on 
monday outlining the west german position on washingtons 
compromise proposal but he declined to give details of the 
letters contents 
he said kohl would telephone bush tuesday for further 
consultations 
us officials say that as part of a compromise washington would 
agree in principle to shortrange weapons negotiations at some 
point linked to progress in the vienna talks

about 6000 people gathered at a 
memorial in cambodias capital to observe an annual day of hate 
marking the mass killings of the former khmer rouge government the 
vietnam news agency said 
the ceremony took place saturday at the 129foothigh buddhist 
shrine in phnom penhs cheung ek district where the khmer rouge 
executed 20000 people the report said the report was dated 
sunday and seen in bangkok monday 
it said hundreds of buddhist monks cambodians living overseas 
and foreign diplomats attended the ceremony vice premier chea soth 
said in a speech that any settlement of the cambodian conflict must 
guarantee the khmer rouge do not return to power 
the report said people laid wreaths at toul sleng museum of 
genocide an old school building the khmer rouge used as a torture 
chamber 
the khmer rouge overthrew the usbacked government of lon nol 
in april 1975 the fanatical communists then tried to fashion a 
primitive agrarian society by moving people into slave labor camps 
more than a million died 
vietnam invaded in late 1978 drove the khmer rouge to the thai 
border and installed another communist government in phnom penh 
the khmer rouge is the strongest of three guerrilla groups fighting 
the vietnamese whose announced total pullout by sept 30 triggered 
fears of a khmer rouge return 
disagreement over the future role of the khmer rouge has stalled 
talks between prince norodom sihanouk the main noncommunist 
guerrilla leader and hun sen prime minister of the phnom penh 
government 
according to a vietnam news agency account monitored monday hun 
sen told the president of the nonaligned movement zimbabwes 
president robert mugabe in a message last week that he would let 
the khmer rouge run in a general election only as a political 
party with no military force

conservatives opposed to attorney general dick 
thornburghs choice of a deputy attorney general are trying to 
scuttle the nomination before it is sent to the senate by president 
bush 
the conservative washington legal foundation has distributed 
press packets containing material critical of robert b fiske jr 
as part of an effort to persuade bush not to nominate the new york 
attorney for the no 2 job at the justice department 
fiske a moderate republican who once chaired the american bar 
associations judicial screening panel is accused by conservatives 
of trying to thwart many of former president reagans appointees to 
the federal bench 
representatives of various conservative organizations such as 
the american conservative union and the free congress foundation 
have privately urged bush administration officials not to send the 
nomination to the senate 
i cant see how conservatives can do anything but be in 
opposition to him becoming deputy attorney general said patrick 
mcguigan a scholar at the free congress foundation 
the conservative interest groups have enlisted support from sen 
gordon humphrey rnh a member of the senate judiciary committee 
who has expressed misgivings about fiske 
on monday humphrey wrote bush to question fiskes party 
loyalty citing the 1000 that fiske donated to a democrat who ran 
unsuccessfully last year for senator from vermont 
humphrey who released copies of his letter to bush wrote that 
the 1000 donation to the campaign of democrat william gray showed 
that fiske is not truly committed to the goals of a republican 
administration 
the donation raises profound questions about mr fiskes 
commitment to the republican platform and your own judicial 
philosophy humphrey said 
in his letter humphrey said his concerns were shared by other 
republican members of the judiciary committee 
mcguigan said he has had numerous conversations with officials 
at the white house and the justice department expressing 
conservative opposition to fiske 
there can be no doubt in the minds of the white house and the 
department of justice as to where its normal allies stand on the 
fiske nomination mcguigan said 
david runkel the attorney generals press secretary said 
fiskes donation to grays campaign was based on personal 
friendship not politics 
this guy is a personal friend he served as us attorney in 
vermont the same time bob was us attorney in manhattan runkel 
said 
meanwhile the man fiske wants to replace deputy attorney 
general harold g christensen will leave his job on june 1 the 
department said 
christensen who took office last fall following his 
confirmation by the senate will return to private legal practice 
in salt lake city the department said

ethiopian police stopped students from 
demonstrating in the streets and sealed off both campuses of the 
university of addis ababa residents and diplomatic sources 
reported 
the attempted demonstration came three days after president 
mengistu haile mariams government crushed a coup led by senior 
generals including the armed forces chief of staff and commander 
of the air force 
a diplomat in the ethiopian capital said by telephone the 
students gathered inside the campus but when they tried to go into 
the streets armed police pushed them back all the workers were 
ordered off the campuses and police remained at the gates 
he said there were conflicting reports about the purpose of the 
demonstration 
the students were singing some people say they had demands to 
present to the government others say they were supporting last 
weeks coup attempt i am not sure which i dont speak amharic 
ethiopias official language 
a western diplomat also speaking on condtiion of anonymity 
said details of the demonstration by a few hundred students were 
sketchy but that some carried banners critical of mengistu 
he said there were reports that police beat students with 
truncheons and some injured ones were taken to the hospital 
an addis ababa resident told the associated press both campuses 
were quiet in the afternoon and ethiopias official media had not 
mentioned the confrontation by 7 pm 
last weeks coup attempt began tuesday afternoon a few hours 
after mengistu left for a visit to east germany it was crushed 
friday with the surrender of the 150000man 2nd army in asmara 
capital of northern eritrea province 
the government has not mentioned casualties and has announced 
only the deaths of three generals merid negussie chief of staff 
amha desta air force commander and denissie bulto 2nd army 
commander 
initially the government said they were killed by soldiers 
loyal to the government mengistu who hurried home wednesday 
night told a weekend rally in addis ababa they committed suicide 
rather than surrender 
mengistu also indicated the generals were unhappy with the 
governments conduct of the wars with rebels in eritrea and in 
tigre province and with his marxist rule 
there were often cases when our forces were whistled back when 
they appeared to be on the brink of victory he declared 
unitersity students demonstrated frequently against emperor 
haile selassie before mengistu and fellow officers seized power in 
1974

hundreds of house members boosted their income 
last year with speaking fees investments and money from such other 
sources as jewelry making and tv residuals disclosure forms showed 
monday house speaker jim wright paid off at least 105000 in debt 
but may have had to dig into personal assets to do it 
the most common addition to congressional pay was in fat fees 
from interest groups in exchange for giving speeches 
almost all house members have outside investments some 
substantial 
some earn money from previous careers including pensions 
some moonlight 
for example rep ben nighthorse campbell dcolo a northern 
cheyenne indian earned 5000 last year for his jewelry designs 
rep tom mcmillen dmd a former national basketball 
association player received deferred income totaling 45000 from 
the washington bullets and atlanta hawks he also reported 10000 
in income for renting space and equipment to his reelection 
campaign 
the disclosure forms filed annually by all 535 members of the 
house and senate provide a look at congress outside income and the 
wealth or lack thereof of each member each form lists a 
members money received his assets and liabilities 
the senate reports were released last friday 
house members are limited to earning an additional 30 percent 
or 26850 in honoraria for appearances most lawmakers donate 
anything over that to charity 
the forms do not provide precise data on congressional income 
listing only ranges for example properties worth 52000 and 
98000 respectively both would be listed in the 
50001to100000 range an asset worth millions could be listed 
simply as more than 250000 unless a member chose to spell it out 
this often shrouds the true wealth of an individual member but 
does provide a guide to where that lawmaker derives investment and 
other income 
wright who has been under investigation for allegations that he 
used his leadership position for financial gain got out of debt in 
1988 according to his disclosure statement 
his debt somewhere between 105000 and 200000 was paid off 
leaving wright with no financial liabilities 
his assets somewhere between 31005 to 100000 compared with 
a range of 155000 to 435000 in 1987 but the current accounting 
does not include holdings in the blind trust he established in 1987 
house members homes also neednt be listed 
the financial disclosure statements show that honoraria 
generally fees for outside speeches were an important part of the 
incomes of many of the 435 house members supplementing a federal 
salary which in most cases comes to 89500 
house majority whip tony coelho dcalif the thirdranking 
house democrat doubled his salary last year with 90100 from 53 
paid speeches to get under the house ceiling in honoraria he gave 
63575 to charity in 177 separate donations 
house republican leader bob michel of illinois reported income 
of 165865 to 180864 and assets of 165000 to 400000 he 
earned twice the 30000 wright earned in speaking fees giving 
30900 out of the total 60500 to charity 
michel listed some of the side benefits of taking part in 
charity golf tournaments 966 worth of golf clothing and 
paraphernalia from the bob hope desert classic the kemper open 
the jerry ford invitational and others 
house majority leader thomas s foley dwash reported income 
of 134250 to 138250 most of the excess over his 99500

legislators opened debate monday 
on a bill to let blacks serve in the cabinet while remaining 
excluded from parliament 
the government says the aim is to bring a black into the cabinet 
for the first time possibly as minister or deputy minister in 
charge of black education 
the governing national party supports the bill but parties to 
its left and right oppose it the measure would allow the president 
to appoint people to the cabinet even if they were not members of 
parliament 
parliament includes a chamber for asians a chamber for people 
of mixedrace and the dominant white chamber the black majority 
has no formal role in national affairs 
the rev allan hendrickse leader of the mixedrace chamber 
said during mondays debate that he knew of no prominent black 
leaders who supported the bill and described the government move as 
tokenism

thailand complained to burma on monday 
about a largescale incursion of burmese troops who were attacking 
karen rebels the government spokesman said 
thai officials said 400 to 800 burmese troops trying to attack 
the rebels from the rear intruded into northern tak province 
saturday and burned a village marketplace thai border police found 
the bodies of six burmese soldiers after pushing the intruders back 
with artillery fire officials said monday 
government spokesman suvit yodmanee said director general thep 
devakul of the foreign ministrys political department summoned 
burmese ambassador nyunt swe and lodged a protest 
he said thailand demanded compensation 
so long as they stay inside their borders we consider that a 
burmese affair once they come into thailand it is our policy to 
drive anybody back karens or burmese suvit said 
the military government in rangoon last year killed hundreds of 
burmese in crushing a popular uprising for democracy and vowed to 
destroy the karens an ethnic rebel group that has fought for 40 
years for greater autonomy 
thailand said burmese soldiers over the weekend intruded into 
ban wangkaew village of mae sot district about 235 miles north of 
bangkok and attacked the rebel camp of kaw moo ra which is 
separated from thailand by the moei river 
thai officers said the soldiers were driven back before dawn 
sunday they said six bodies were found 
karen sources claimed 60 to 65 burmese soldiers were killed in 
fighting saturday and many wounded five rebels were killed and 11 
wounded they claimed one burmese student fighting alongside the 
rebels was killed and another wounded they said 
government forces began their attack on ko moo ra on thursday 
after overrunning the major rebel stronghold of wangkha two days 
earlier 
rebel officials say the loss of five key border crossings since 
the burmese intensified their offensive last october has severely 
disrupted the black market trade that has sustained their 
insurgency

rep jim wrights financial disclosure 
statement released on the eve of a crucial hearing into his 
alleged rules violations touches only lightly if at all on money 
deals that led the ethics committee to charge the house speaker 
mallightco the investment partnership that sparked many of the 
69 ethics charges against the texas democat is mentioned but once 
in the liabilities section with the notation that a loan was 
satisfied during 1988 
wright made no mention of royalties from his book reflections 
of a public man the ethics committee has accused wright of a 
scheme to evade outside income limits by selling the book 
previously 
there is one brief mention of jewell enterprises a company that 
went under after disastrous nursing home investments causing 
wright and other investors a substantial loss the speaker listed 
stock in the bankrupt company as an asset worth less than 5000 
the ethics committee was scheduled to hold an unusual televised 
hearing on tuesday on wrights longshot motion to dismiss the most 
serious charges against him as the speaker sought a badly needed 
victory to counter a losing public relations battle 
stephen susman a hardnosed houston lawyer brought in this 
month to bolster wrights legal defense will take the lead role in 
the hearing and spent monday preparing his case susman is expected 
to argue that the ethics committee stretched house rules beyond 
their intended meaning when it charged wright with 69 violations 
the panels special outside counsel richard j phelan of 
chicago will defend the committees interpretation of the rules a 
ruling on the motion to dismiss charges was expected later this 
week 
wright who has often owed substantial amounts used 1988 to 
work his way out of debt listing no liabilities at yearend 
according to the statement released monday along with those of 
other house members 
his income was between 188183 and 203579 and his assets 
ranged from 31005100000 these figures however do not 
include holdings in a blind trust established by wright in 1987 
those figures were not available 
wright paid off debts totaling between 105000 and 220000 
including money he owed to mallightco and a bank the special 
counsel to the ethics committee said wright satisfied these notes 
with money he made from his share of an oil and gas investment that 
is still under investigation by the panel 
the speaker earned 170000 as his share of the deal his most 
profitable financial transaction mallightco bought and later sold 
its interest in the prospective sabine lake oil and gas well along 
the texaslouisiana line the well turned up dry there was no 
trace of the deal on the disclosure form 
mallightco was owned by wright his wife betty their partner 
george mallick and mallicks wife until the speaker pulled out 
of the partnership last year the ethics committee said there was 
reason to believe wright received gifts from mallick who 
according to the panel had a direct interest in legislation 
the disclosure showed wright received between 5001 and 15000 
in oil and gas royalties from southeastern resources in 1988 
as in previous years he held 57 acres of land in van buren 
ark valued at 500115000 and real estate in prince georges 
county md worth between 15001 and 50000 
wrights use of the sabine lake profits to satisfy his debts 
left him with fewer assets than a decade ago the speakers 1978 
disclosure form showed holdings of between 72000 and 170000 
meanwhile wrights defense against the ethics charges will be 
that the rules were changed in midstream 
wrights lawyers are expected to argue tuesday that the two most 
serious sets of charges should be dismissed because the panel 
reacting to a new moral climate has stretched the rules beyond 
their original intent 
but his lawyers concede such motions are routinely denied and 
they give the speaker less than an even chance of winning a 
preemptive dismissal of the charges

about 50 villagers from bosnia have 
gone on a hunger strike in front of the federal parliament in the 
capital to protest harassment by police and communist authorities 
an activist said monday 
also monday 80 workers at a foodprocessing company in bosnia 
said they were fasting and about 2000 others protested to demand 
back the jobs and pay they lost because of a huge financial 
scandal the official tanjug news agency reported bosnia is one of 
yugoslavias six republics 
the group from the bosnian village of mosevac began their hunger 
strike saturday demanding the release of local youth activist hasan 
delic who was arrested may 13 said activist dzevad galijasevic 
the official youth organization headed by galijasevic and delic 
claimed three years ago that the local communist leadership was 
rife with corruption and political nepotism in mosevac about 180 
miles west of belgrade 
the group accused local county and police officials of 
misappropriating funds collected for building mosevacs public hall 
the protesters on monday also demanded the resignation of the 
bosnian police chief muhamed besic and a meeting with members of 
the federal government to air their grievances 
in the bosnian town of velika kladusa agrokomerc workers 
demanded that all factories resume normal production that was 
disrupted since the foodprocessing company was found to have 
issued about 1 billion worth of uncovered bills of exchange in 
1987 worth tanjug reported 
earlier reports said the workers were demanding the release of 
fikret abdic the jailed former director who has been on trial for 
the past year on embezzlement charges 
thousands of agrokomerc employees were left jobless or on 
minimal wages since abdic was removed from his post and arrested

parents who were crestfallen when their bright 
toddlers were rejected by a prestigious private preschool can take 
heart the dalton school now admits it was never really able to 
pick the best brains 
school officials sensitive to the feelings of those distraught 
parents and frustrated by their inability to judge the academic 
competence and character of toddlers have decided to close the 
preschool 
its difficult enough to select good students when theyre 17 
and 18 its almost impossible to make distinctions except on the 
edges if theyre extraordinarily brilliant or retarded when they 
are 2 james w wickenden cochairman of daltons admissions 
and scholarship committee and a former dean of admissions at 
princeton university said monday 
new yorkers hunting for the fast lane to the right track for 
their children will now have to wait for kindergarten to begin 
their frantic push to get their youngsters into dalton 
the board of trustees voted last month to phase out the nursery 
school over the next two years as the 34 children who enter in 
september at age 3 proceed to kindergarten 
school spokesman frank j carnabuci said the process had become 
something of a rat race 
the competitive admission to dalton was lampooned in the movie 
baby boom when a mother tried to cope with her daughters 
rejection 
i dont understand she said her resume was perfect her 
references impeccable 
for parents their offsprings failure to get into an elite 
nursery is their wonderful little childs first rejection said 
cynthia bing who provides advice on how to get into the citys 
elite private schools it wont be as heartbreaking when they 
dont get into harvard or princeton 
admissions director chris mcdermott said there were almost six 
times as many toddlers trying to get into the preschool as there 
were openings and no reliable means for judging the little 
applicants 
ms mcdermott said the decision was based on watching a child 
play for 45 minutes with three other toddlers and talking with the 
parents often family affiliation and space limitations were the 
deciding factors she said 
wickenden said school administrators decided it would be better 
to admit students when they are older when test scores and other 
information are available to help make better decisions 
kindergarten applicants are judged by their scores on the 
educational records bureau test a standardized admission test as 
well as their records from nursery schools and interviews ms 
mcdermott said 
wickenden said a greater percentage of students who entered at 
age 2 had to be asked to leave the school in later grades because 
of poor performance than did youngsters who were admitted at the 
ripe old age of 5 or 6 
the hope would be by delaying the admission process by 1 
years it would be fairer and the school could strengthen the 
academic excellence of those admitted he said 
dr sirgay sanger a child psychiatrist in manhattan didnt buy 
those arguments if you have a headache you dont cut off the 
head he said 
instead of abolishing the program the school should improve its 
selection process especially since preschool programs are in such 
demand by working parents sanger said 
children can be judged at an early age if they are studied 
carefully over an extended period not in a 45minute interview he 
said they can have off days and on days and you need to see them 
at different times 
for parents who had their heart set on sending their 
preschoolers to dalton there should be some comfort in the 
knowledge that manhattan has about 115 private nursery schools 
with about 4500 slots for 3 and 4yearolds according to the 
parents league of new york an association of private schools and 
parents 
in september there will be no 3yearolds sitting out on the 
street with nowhere to go to school said mrs bing

a guerrilla facing execution for a 
1986 bombing that killed three people has married his girlfriend in 
an interracial wedding ceremony on death row a newspaper reported 
monday 
robert mcbride 25 of the african national congress was 
sentenced to death in april 1987 10 months after planting a bomb 
at a beachfront bar in durban that killed three women and injured 
69 people the blast came two days after president pw botha 
declared a national state of emergency 
the pretoria news said mcbride who is of mixed race married 
his white girlfriend paula in a ceremony conducted by an anglican 
minister at pretoria central prison on may 10 they decided not to

maiden name disclosed said the reporter who wrote the story 
the couple reportedly met almost daily over the past two years 
communicating through a glass window at the prison 
at his trial mcbride said he carried out the bombing on his own 
and feared punishment by the anc for violating its directives 
against hitting civilian targets the blast killed two whites and 
an indian most of the injured were white 
no execution date has been set mcbrides wife was quoted as 
saying she hoped the sentence would be commuted 
the justice department said monday that two black trade 
unionists on death row were reprieved by botha who commuted their 
sentences to 20year prison terms 
seven other prisoners are scheduled to be executed this week 
according to an organization of human rights lawyers

a man charged with conspiring to ship 
explosives to the philippines in 1981 to help depose thenpresident 
ferdinand marcos was framed his lawyer argued monday 
attorney james brosnahan made the allegation during opening 
arguments in the longawaited trial of steven psinakis 
the case has generated protests from current leaders in the 
philippines where psinakis is considered a hero 
more than 100 philippine lawmakers have urged president bush to 
block the prosecution and president corazon aquino interceded 
personally to get psinakis freed on 200000 bail the presidents 
brotherinlaw sen agapito aquino has said he will seek removal 
of us military bases from the philippines if psinakis is 
convicted 
psinakis 57 a greekborn us citizen has denied any role in 
bombmaking and has said he is being prosecuted because of a 
vendetta against him by the local fbi and federal prosecutors he 
declined to make any statement monday 
prosecutors said pieces of explosive detonator cord bombmaking 
materials and shipping documents were found in a search of garbage 
at psinakis home in december 1981 
but brosnahan told jurors psinakis was framed it was planted 
there and the question is by whom 
he said psinakis never purchased never sent never 
transported and never received detonating cord in interstate 
commerce without a permit 
in a news conference outside the courtroom brosnahan said 
psinakis had become the target of threats by marcos agents and 
supporters he was told somebody was going to get him and he was 
told that repeatedly he said 
brosnahan drew heated objections from assistant us attorney 
ben burch when he tried to detail events in the philippines in the 
70s and 80s said that psinakis codefendant charles avila is 
now a mayor in a philippine city and described psinakis efforts 
to persuade us authorities that marcos agents were committing 
crimes here avila has remained in the philippines which has no 
extradition treaty with the united states 
burch said the prosecution will play two wiretapped telephone 
conversations between psinakis and a st louis doctor active in the 
antimarcos movement in the calls he said the men used the code 
terms of 50s and 60s and 30s to refer to explosive detonator 
cord and its size 
shipments of explosive cord from st louis to san francisco were 
picked up at a bus station by a friend of psinakis he said then 
delivered to someone in the psinakis family 
burch said investigators searching the psinakis home found a 
letter addressed dearest buddy discussed bcs or blasting 
caps stripping the rope a process used to get the explosive 
material from the detonator cord and a shortage of powdered 
sugar he said the letter typed on psinakis typewriter was 
signed steve 
psinakis wife presentacion comes from a prominent philippine 
family allegedly robbed of its riches by marcos the couple moved 
to san francisco in 1973 after marcos went into exile three years 
ago psinakis returned to the philippines a hero 
psinakis was indicted secretly in december 1986 and arrested the 
following july on arrival at san francisco international airport 
if convicted of conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the 
shipment of explosives from st louis to san francisco psinakis 
faces up to 15 years in prison and 20000 in fines

the guinness book of records on monday announced 
it is scrapping its gluttony section because eating a whole ox in 
less than 42 days could make you sick and because the world is more 
healthconscious 
if you have witnessed one of these competitions they are 
simply gross said editor donald mcfarlan we now regard these 
records as unhealthy and outmoded in the light of growing concern 
about health issues worldwide 
mcfarlan decided to drop 43 gluttony records from the books 
1990 edition due out in autumn they include records for consuming 
beer prunes eels eggs gherkins ice cream pancakes spaghetti 
sushi and snails 
the book the worlds bestselling after the bible has carried 
a health warning for several years pointing out that attempts to 
break gluttony records must be regarded as extremely 
inadvisable 
no one has ever died while attempting to break a gluttony 
record as far as the publisher knows 
mcfarlan hopes people will try to break more socially acceptable 
records so new categories are planned for the 1990 edition 
including the most cars converted to leadfree gasoline on a single 
site 
only one gluttony entry greatest omnivore will remain for 
its historical and nostalgic value guinness said in a statement 
the record holder is frenchman michel lotito whose diet since 
1966 has included 10 bicycles a supermarket cart seven television 
sets six chandeliers a coffin and a cessna light aircraft 
as for oxeating johann ketzler of munich set the meateating 
record when he ate a roasted one in 42 days in 1880 
the book is sold in the united states as the guinness book of 
world records

the ap also reported that inhofe told the federal election 
commission in a letter dated oct 19 1988 that abercrombie lent 
him 20000 on june 30 1986 and inhofe then lent the money to his 
campaign

on oct 23 inhofe amended his statement to the fec and said the

and that he had given abercrombie power of attorney to sell the 
stock 
inhofe has denied any intentional wrongdoing saying a candidate 
may lend his own assets to his campaign and that he believed the 
20000 was his money and not a contribution from a supporter 
however inhofe also filed documents with the fec that use the

neighbors of a highrise apartment 
building were kept away monday while demolition experts worked out 
plans to bring down the building that wouldnt fall 
we told you so said a grassroots neighborhood organization 
which had argued the building and two others were solid enough to 
be renovated for lowincome housing 
more than 550 pounds of dynamite failed to bring the 36yearold 
building down sunday although a second round of explosives knocked 
out the first two floors leaving the main part of the building and 
a wing leaning against each other 
two businesses in the area remained closed and four homes 
evacuated police posted a 14man detail around the building and 
traffic was rerouted 
the neighborhood organization project basic had tried 
unsuccessfully in federal court to stop the demolition of the 
10story hartford park building claiming it was structurally sound 
group officials said they hoped the failure of two blasts to 
bring down the building would help their case when they try to stop 
the demolition of two other 90unit buildings in the project 
it makes our position better said group spokesman anthony 
hempfer we will be submitting this as evidence 
some people might find this amusing said stephen orourke 
head of the citys housing authority to me its a nightmare 
why didnt it fall thats an open question said david r 
evans the explosives expert who coordinated the blasts i 
knocked out the two floors i wanted to knock out and by all 
indications the building should have fallen 
its the way its built evans said its built like a 
honeycomb 
earlier this month an 87yearold grain silo in forth worth 
texas came down only after repeated blasts with more than 700 
pounds of dynamite 
the providence housing authority decided to switch from 
explosives to a wrecking crane which will begin work tuesday said 
orourke who said the process could take up to two weeks 
us district judge raymond pettine had allowed the housing 
authority to continue with its plans to raze the building after 
engineers testified the 2300 holes drilled in the building to hold 
the dynamite had made it structurally unsafe 
during a hearing earlier this month a housing authority 
engineer testified that the building probably would not withstand a 
40mph wind said project basic 
project basic had argued that the lowrise units slated to 
replace the building would not provide enough affordable housing to 
compensate for the lost units 
the failed attempt to bring the building down clearly 
demonstates the structural integrity of the hartford park 
highrises the group said in a statement we told you so 
given the strength of these buildings they can and should be 
rehabilitated and occupied by families and individuals in need of 
safe decent and affordable housing it said 
orourke however said the structural safety of the building 
was not at issue 
they were coming down for sociological reasons to lower the 
density of the site he said 
a hearing on project basics attempt to stop the demolition of 
two other hartford park buildings was scheduled for june 6

the chairman of the securities and exchange 
commission said monday that congress should consider passing 
legislation to restrict the power of states to limit corporate 
takeovers 
david ruder said the state and federal partnership governing 
securities laws is undergoing a severe test because of a growing 
tendency by states to pass restrictive laws asserting state control 
over outside takeover attempts of local companies 
in remarks prepared for a new york conference on corporate 
financing ruder noted the sec has stated previously the agencys 
belief that antitakeover statutes passed by state legislatures in 
new york and delaware were unconstitutional 
he said he believes congress could eventually be forced to 
address this question by limiting the power of states to restrict 
takeover attempts 
limitations on the free transferability of securities of 
corporations that are owned by shareholders nationwide diminish the 
efficiency depth and liquidity of the nations securities 
markets ruder said 
federal law should control in this area by preempting state 
statutes that unduly interfere with the buying and selling of 
securities he said 
ruder who announced last week that he was stepping down as sec 
chairman to return to teaching at northwestern universitys law 
school said that unless state legislatures on their own stop 
passing antitakeover legislation congress should enact 
restrictions

about 100 armed men boarded a train 
carrying 1500 tons of emergency food supplies to the warravaged 
south and robbed three relief workers a government statement said 
monday 
it said three western relief officials were robbed of their 
personal belongings but were not harmed and the gunmen left 
without touching the food supplies it did not give the names or 
nationalities of the officials working with the unsponsored 
relief project 
it reported the robbers boarded the train sunday about nine 
miles north of malwal and said they were searching for foreigners 
after holding the three officials briefly as hostages the gunmen 
left and told the train crew to continue the trip to aweil 
according to the statement it gave no other details 
the train started the journey saturday after a delay of more 
than a month caused in part by crewmen who feared making the trip 
through the embattled area without an armed escort 
it left muglad in southwestern sudan for aweil a town 180 miles 
farther south that is controlled by government troops 
the train with 48 freight cars is scheduled to drop off the 
loads from 32 cars in malwal and maput two rebelheld towns 
between muglad and aweil 
it had been schedluled to depart april 15 a further delay was 
caused by government objections to the plan to deliver food to 
areas held by the rebels sudan peoples liberation army 
organizing the shipment is operation lifeline sudan which is 
part of a un effort to help some 100000 people threatened with 
starvation 
the 132 million project was planned to stockpile 100000 tons 
of food in southern sudan by the end of this month but less than 
half of that amount has been delivered 
un officials have said the operation is a race against time 
seasonal rains that begin in may turn roads and airfields into 
quagmires 
the southern rebels mainly christians and animists have been 
battling for more than six years for greater autonomy and more 
economic development from the central government in khartoum the 
government and northern sudan are predominantly moslem

a chinese official told vice president dan 
quayle on monday the beijing government had agreed at the start of 
ongoing mass demonstrations that authorities would refrain from 
violence an administration official said 
but wan li head of chinas national peoples congress the 
chinese legislature also told quayle that restoring order in china 
would be the first priority and no progress can be made toward 
promised reforms during the current upheaval 
wan met with the vice president and later with secretary of 
state james a baker iii during an 11day visit to the united 
states 
he refused to comment on the situation despite persistent 
questioning by reporters and was described as very careful in 
his talk with quayle 
he was careful to position himself on either no side or every 
side of this thing in that meeting said the administration 
official who said also that wan was careful to point out that most 
of the tension in beijing and the imposition of martial law has 
occurred since he left the country for his trip 
however wan did say that before he left the country several 
days ago they agreed not to use violence against the 
demonstrators said the source 
his visit to washington came as more than 100 top military 
leaders vowed monday to refrain from entering beijing to suppress 
the demonstrators who have seized control of the capital 
also monday members of wans peoples congress began gathering 
signatures needed to open a special session on the legality of 
martial law sources said indicating a further erosion of wans 
support 
early tuesday witnesses said soldiers clashed with crowds at 
one intersection witnesses said soldiers hit people with sticks 
and belts but did not open fire the incident appeared isolated 
one report said 15 residents were injured 
the administration declined immediate comment on the violence 
in part because it was unclear whether the incident was ordered as 
part of a strategy or was just an isolated occurrence said one 
official 
quayle asked about the matter told reporters during a photo 
session with wan that he hoped for a nonviolent solution to the 
chinese strife 
we support the advancement of democracy freedom and human 
rights around the world he said we certainly hope that the 
public demonstrations that have gone on in china and continue will 
be successfully concluded without any violence 
during his meeting with wan quayle underscored the us 
interest in human rights and democratization worldwide and the 
hope that china would continue its political development and 
economic reforms the vice presidents press office said

secretary of state james a baker iii urged 
israel on monday to stop settling jews on the west bank and in gaza 
and to give up any aspirations of annexing territories captured 
from jordan and egypt in the 1967 sixday war 
baker in a speech to an american jewish group said now is 
the time to lay aside once and for all the unrealistic vision of 
a greater israel 
he also called on prime minister yitzhak shamirs government to 
reopen schools on the west bank and in gaza closed by israeli 
authorities attempting to cope with a palestinian uprising 
reach out to the palestinians as neighbors who deserve 
political rights baker said in the speech to the american israel 
public affairs committee a private research and lobbying group 
holding a convention here 
at the same time baker called on palestinian arabs to abandon 
the illusion of control over all of palestine meaning israel 
apart from the west bank and gaza 
he also urged the arab world to end its economic boycott of the 
jewish state and to recognize israel as a neighbor and partner in 
trade and human contact 
bakers speech which he gave before meeting with israeli 
defense minister yitzhak rabin represented a hardened us stance 
toward jerusalem while also appealing for concessions from radical 
arabs 
he said the united states would not dictate an outcome to 
the negotiations baker hopes will spring from a proposal by shamir 
to hold elections among palestinians on the west bank and gaza 
but baker said we do have an idea about the reasonable 
middle ground to which a settlement should be directed he then 
proceeded to stake out a position on many controversial issues 
including israels control of the west bank and gaza 
he said palestinian selfgovernment in the territories would 
provide ample protection for israels security 
baker did not explicitly rule out retention by israel of some of 
the territory as rabin and several other leading israelis say is 
essential to deter another arab attack 
but baker stressed that israelis ought to get used to the idea 
of a negotiated settlement that will in all probability involve 
territorial withdrawal and the emergence of a new political 
reality 
in terse terms he told israel forswear annexation stop 
settlement activity allow schools to reopen 
at the same time baker reiterated that the united states did 
not support creation of an independent palestinian state 
rabin talking to reporters after a 70minute meeting with 
baker said schools in gaza were open with 200000 students in 
attendance but on the west bank the israeli official said we 
learned that once schools are opened the confrontation between kids 
and the military forces of israel increase the number of casualties 
among youngsters 
rabin said he had not read bakers speech which was delivered 
about an hour before their meeting but he said the key question at 
the moment was whether palestinians on the west bank and gaza would 
engage israel in negotiations as proposed by jerusalem 
we learned that once a peace process starts it has its own 
momentum rabin said 
the israeli official said he and baker concentrated on how to 
get elections going and how to remove the threat of terror that 
keeps palestinians from participating in shamirs proposal 
rabin said many palestinians realize that what israel has 
offered is a unique opportunity but they were holding back out of 
fear of assassination 
shamirs twostep plan involves electing palestinian leaders to 
negotiate temporary selfrule and then holding negotiations among 
israel palestinians jordan and egypt on an overall settlement 
earlier rabin reviewed the military situation in the middle 
east with defense secretary dick cheney without broaching any 
requests for new weapons deals defense officials said 
the officials who asked not to be named said rabin and cheney 
met privately and with other officials for more than an hour at the 
pentagon with rabin offering the newly installed cheney a progress 
report on the overall situation in the middle east 
rabin and cheney did not discuss in any detail israels 
latest regional initiative the sources said rabin and president 
bush are expected to delve more deeply into that issue during white 
house talks on wednesday 
seymour d reich chairman of the conference of presidents of 
major american jewish organizations said in a statement that 
baker deserves praise for calling on the palestinian arabs to 
abandon violence and to reach out to israel to convince the jewish 
state of their peaceful intentions 
also reich said we are gratified by secretary bakers words 
urging the palestinians to abandon their hopes of destroying israel 
and to renounce all talk of taking over israel in stages 
the jewish leader said the major issue however was bringing a 
halt to the palestinian uprising and accepting israels plan for 
free elections

tiananmen square has become a garbagestrewn 
encampment for students demanding more freedom and a symbolic field 
of battle in the political struggle within chinas leadership 
a citizen said late monday night while manning a roadblock to 
keep soldiers out of the the city every four years you have 
elections in america and change your government every 10 years we 
have riots and change ours 
the main political combatants are premier li peng who is cool 
to political reform and appears to have support from deng xiaoping 
the 84yearold leader and communist party chief zhao ziyang 
known as a relative liberal 
both have tried to manipulate the students 
under dengs orders according to reports li has equated the 
movement with turmoil and tried to give the impression of 
strong leadership by crushing it 
zhao has tried to use the discontent as a springboard back into 
the favor of both people and party 
neither has succeeded 
li ordered martial law saturday but the soldiers surrounding 
beijing have yet to enter the city 
zhao won points with the people by visiting hungerstriking 
students last week tears in his eyes but chinese sources say he 
has lost support in the party 
those apparent failures introduced two new elements the 
military and representatives of the national peoples congress 
on monday seven leading generals expressed opposition to 
martial law and said the peoples liberation army should not enter 
beijing 
nie rongzhen and xu xiangqian the nations last living 
marshals said sunday night the army would not suppress the 
students their announcement in all official media clearly limited 
lis order which gave the military the right to taken any steps 
necessary to restore stability 
the military appears to be saying it is not willing to be used 
as a pawn and wants the political squabble to stop 
also monday sources said representatives of the national 
peoples congress chinas legislature were collecting signatures 
on a petition for a special meeting to consider the legality of 
lis martiallaw order 
the science and technology daily reported monday that 24 
deputies sent a letter saying the disturbances should be ended by 
democratic and legal methods 
students and intellectuals have been part of other political 
power struggles in communist chinas 40year history such as the 
1956 hundred flowers campaign and the 196676 cultural revolution 
by the radical left 
a brief student campaign for democracy in the winter of 198687 
led to the downfall of communist party chairman hu yaobang a 
relative liberal whose death april 15 inspired the current movement 
beijing is a sea of rumor and innuendo with no free press to 
help sort it out within one week various sources have reported 
that li and three others had seized power that zhao had resigned 
that li and deng had stepped down and that president yang shangkun 
was preparing a coup 
to that confusion can be added the contradictory tone of the 
official press on monday the front page of the peoples daily 
carried both an editorial favoring the crackdown and a story 
criticizing martial law 
the student movement is largely a product of dengs opening to 
the west and his economic reforms 
students know of the people power uprising that ousted president 
ferdinand e marcos of the philippines three years ago and about 
student protest in south korea it would be difficult to close 
china again 
lacking a victory by one of the three top leaders a vacuum at 
the top could result 
right now li appears weakest because he declared martial law 
but could not enforce it 
zhaos position has not been strong for months he has been 
blamed for recordhigh inflation and an overheated economy 
associated with his policy of introducing elements of a market 
economy in the staterun system 
deng has been is shaken because 11 years of popular economic 
liberalization were not accompanied by political reform 
right now the stage is empty a government source said 
all the people in the audience are on their feet clapping for a 
new leader but no one is coming out i think this is a tragic 
moment in our history

the bush administration said monday it is 
studying a response from west germany to a proposed us compromise 
on the issue of shortrange missiles in europe 
deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk said the 
response received monday afternoon had been discussed with 
president bush by national security adviser brent scowcroft 
popadiuk said he had no details or characterization of the 
latest proposal to cross the atlantic it is being studied he 
said 
however another us official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the issue was still unsettled 
the official said the reply had neither advanced nor lessened 
prospects for a settlement were not home yet the official 
said 
bush on sunday voiced optimism that the uswest german dispute 
which has split nato would be resolved before the alliances 
40thanniversary meeting begins next monday in brussels 
the flap centers on whether to negotiate with the soviets on 
reducing the size of natos nuclear arsenal in western europe 
the west german government responding to heavy political 
pressure for disarmament has supported such talks the united 
states has generally held that eastwest negotiations on the 
weapons should begin until the easts superiority in conventional 
arms is erased 
last friday the us side gave west german defense minister 
gerhard stoltenberg a compromise offer that west german officials 
privately said opened the door to eventual ussoviet negotiations 
secretary of state james a baker iii who spent the weekend in 
kennebunkport maine with bush at the presidents oceanside 
retreat said saturday the german stance was too vague for a 
deal 
the germans thus far have insisted on leaving open the option of 
eliminating all nato and warsaw pact shortrange missiles in any 
negotiations 
under the us proposal meanwhile negotiations would be held 
only after nato and and warsaw pact nations agreed on cuts in 
conventional forces that would reduce the easts superiority 
earlier monday popadiuk called the issue a natowide issue 
and its one that affects all members and all members have a view 
on it and of course all views are welcome 
the issue will be worked and hopefully will be resolved before 
the nato summit so that we can have a successful nato summit 
popadiuk said

day more than 3500 doctors in delhi left their jobs about 1400 
doctors at government hospitals in chandigarh pondicherry banaras

being allowed to have private practices and firm schedules for 
promotions 
most are junior staffers and nearly all are resident physicians 
emergency cases are been handled by senior doctors 
the strikers want a montly increase of 53 they now receive 
between 200 and 269 per month 
they also seek an increase in the monthly allowance for not 
having a private practice from 16 to 40 government doctors are

federal regulators on monday rejected a bid by 
one of the nations most profitable savings and loans to switch its 
insurance coverage from the fund that backs thrifts to the more 
healthy one that insures bank deposits 
the application by great western bank of beverly hills calif 
was denied by the federal home loan bank board which rejected the 
institutions claim that it was exempt from a temporary ban on 
defections from the federal savings and loan insurance corp 
great western the nations secondlargest fslicinsured 
institution had filed an application claiming it was eligible to 
convert from coverage by fslic to insurance with the federal 
deposit insurance corp 
the application was seen as a test case on whether regulators 
would allow widescale defections from the fslic although several 
smaller sampls already have been allowed to leave the thrifts 
insurance fund 
the fdic is considered the more attractive insurance fund 
because it retains big assets while the fslic has been largely 
depleted by the losses and failures plaguing the thrift industry 
legislation enacted in 1987 prohibited thrifts from leaving 
fslic until aug 10 1988 and congress has since extended the 
moratorium until aug 10 1989 thrifts that had already converted 
to fdic or announced their intention prior to march 31 1987 to 
covert by merging with an fdicinsured bank were exempted 
under president bushs 157 billion proposal to restructure and 
rescue the thrift industry institutions would be barred from 
leaving the fslic for another five years the provision is designed 
to help the fund recuperate and to ease the costs of the bailout 
regulators and some members of congress had been concerned that 
widescale defections from fslic could cut the funds intake of 
insurance premiums and make the sampl rescue even more expensive 
great western applied to leave fslic based on its october 1988 
application to merge with the smaller great western savings bank of 
bellevue wash an fdicinsured institution the california thrift 
also cited its march 1987 memorandum of intent to merge with great 
western thrift and loan in salt lake city utah 
the bank board rejected great westerns application to merge 
with the washington thrift and said the utah memorandum was not 
valid because no further steps to combine with the utah thrift had 
been taken since the agreement was signed 
great western which had assets of 308 billion as of dec 31 
issued a statement saying it was disappointed with the bank boards 
ruling 
we are confident that under existing law and regulation great 
westerns program for fdic membership meets every test and we 
intend to vigorously pursue all options available to us said 
james f montgomery chairman and chief executive 
the company did not elaborate on what its options might be

his base salary was 89500 boosted by rents of 5000 to 
15000 honoraria after charitable donations of 26525 and 
interest from a federal credit union of 2500 to 5000 
coelho whose personal finances have recently drawn public 
attention because of what he said was an error in his 1986 
financial disclosure form put most of his assets in a qualified 
blind trust in june 1988 
at the time the california democrats holdings were worth 
65000 to 150000 with the largest investment a rental duplex 
in merced calif valued at 50000 to 150000 
the assets that coelho kept out of the blind trust include 
another rental property in merced valued at 50000 to 100000 
and savings accounts money market accounts and individual 
retirements accounts worth 25000 to 80000 
coelho listed no purchases or sale of property stocks or bonds 
in 1988 but he did refinance his principal residence in the 
virginia suburbs 
that arrangement allowed him in october to pay off loans of 
80000 to 200000 the forms show coelho satisfied a commercial 
loan of 50000 to 100000 from federal city national bank a 
15000 to 50000 line of credit from security pacific national 
bank and the same line of credit from wells fargo bank 
coelho also sent his trustee i barry mehler a check for 
60000 for inclusion in his blind trust last november according 
to an amendment filed to his 1987 financial disclosure he did not 
say where the money came from his aides said they would ask 
excluding his blind trust coelho was left with one liability a 
50000 to 100000 mortgage on his merced rental house from the 
tracy savings and loan institution 
under the 1978 ethics in government act lawmakers are not 
required to reveal any details of transactions dealing with their 
principal residence 
another exemption is details of a spouses income coelhos 
wife phyllis works as an assistant to rep andrew jacobs dind 
coelho a top fundraiser for the democratic party and former 
head of the democratic congressional campaign committee was an 
active speaker on the lecture circuit last year collecting 
honoraria of 90100 he gave 63575 to charity keeping 26525 
a few hundred dollars short of the maximum allowed 
among those who gave coelho 2000 for speaking was drexel 
burnham lambert a brokerage house that also picked up the tab for 
coelho to fly from iowa to los angeles 
the washington post has reported that coehlo had not listed on 
his 1986 disclosure forms a loan he obtained to buy 100000 in 
highyield drexel burnham junk bonds coelho blamed the omission of 
an oversight by his california accountant 
coelho a member of the house agriculture committee accepted 
speaking fees from a number of groups that could have potential 
business before the panel 
they included the california grocers association the american 
horse council the fertilizer institute and the connell rice and 
sugar co 
coelho did a fair amount of traveling at other peoples expense 
to give speeches in 1988 sometimes the destinations were resorts 
but the only overseas trip was five days he spent in israel on a 
trip paid for by project interchange 
the congressman and his wife spent two nights at marco island 
fla paid for by puccio and associates he visited palm springs 
calif two times at the invitation of the mexicanamerican grocers 
association and the tobacco institute and spent three days in 
yosemite national park on a factfinding trip paid for by the 
yosemite park and curry co 
coelho who suffers from epilepsy traveled to new york once and 
california three times for the epilesy foundation of america he 
also visited texas california and new york for the tony coelho 
yes i can disability foundation

the soviet union on monday suggested both nato and 
the warsaw pact be disbanded 
the warsaw treaty states propose disbanding both military 
alliances at the same time starting with disbanding of their 
military forces said foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov 
gerasimov said the full appeal to members of the north atlantic 
treaty organization would be published in soviet newspapers tuesday 
it is not the first time east european officials have broached 
the idea but mondays statement comes one week before a nato 
summit meeting that finds the 16nation western alliance divided 
over the depth of changes in the soviet threat 
west germany advocates talks on the elimination of shortrange 
nuclear weapons from europe while the united states and britain 
say no such talks are possible while the soviet union and its 
allies have overwhelming superiority 
a compromise reportedly is in the offing on the question of 
nuclear arms talks but fundamental differences remain within nato 
west germany is more concerned with eliminating the possibility of 
a destructive eastwest conflict on its territory since even a war 
that nato wins would likely be disastrous for germany 
president mikhail s gorbachev has offered the possibility of an 
undivided europe free of nuclear threat 
gerasimov said monday the east european alliance was suggesting 
expanding arms negotiations to all weapons systems including 
navies 
he said the appeal was being made because times have changed 
since the postwar era when the two alliances were formed 
east european officials have offered the hypothetical 
possibility of dissolving the warsaw pact once nato is disbanded 
and romanian leader nicolae ceausescu mentioned simultaneous 
dissolution years ago the topic has arisen recently in talks by 
hungarian officials contemplating neutrality

a jury was seated monday for the trial of 
us rep donald e lukens who is accused of having sex with an 
underage girl 
prosecutors and defense attorneys spent seven hours selecting 
the jurors who will hear evidence on a misdemeanor charge of 
contributing to the delinquency and unruliness of a minor 
assistant prosecutor rita mangini challenged defense attorney 
thomas tyack in court to explain his decision to excuse the only 
black potential juror the girl who made the allegations against 
lukens is black 
tyack said he excused the woman because her husband works for 
the state there were other jurors who he believed would be more 
appropriate from the defenses point of view and because the 
potential juror appeared to be living in a vacuum 
tyack was referring to her statement that she had absolutely no 
knowledge of the case despite widespread media coverage 
lukens a 58yearold conservative republican was elected to 
congress in 1986 and previously served from 196771 in between 
he ran unsuccessfully for governor and served in the state 
legislature 
a source speaking on condition of anonymity told the 
associated press that lukens indicted feb 23 had offered to 
plead guilty to the charge but the prosecution would not agree to 
his condition that references to any sexual contact with the girl 
be removed from court documents 
franklin county domestic relations judge ronald solove said he 
would consider requests by ms mangini that only limited testimony 
be allowed from the girl regarding two other cases in which she is 
involved as a witness and that her juvenile record not be 
introduced 
the defense maintains the evidence is needed to establish or 
question the girls credibility 
lukens who has repeatedly has denied the allegations and 
accused the girls mother of setting him up for extortion did not 
comment to reporters monday 
columbus television station wsyx on feb 1 broadcast a secretly 
recorded videotape that showed lukens apparently offering a 
government job to the girls mother anna coffman after she asked 
him why he was messing around with her daughter in the tape 
lukens told ms coffman he did not know her daughter was a 
teenager 
if convicted he faces a maximum sentence of 180 days in jail 
and a 1000 fine

prosecution briefs unsealed monday for the 
perjury trial of former us rep pat swindall show the government 
hopes to show that he plotted how he would lie publicly about a 
shady loan deal 
in one brief unsealed in us district court on the eve of juror 
questioning the prosecution argues that public statements swindall 
made after his allegedly false grand jury testimony are relevant to 
the case because they point to a continuation of swindalls 
attempts to limit his own potential criminal exposure 
swindall 38 is accused of lying under oath in 1988 to a 
federal grand jury investigating his dealings with charles 
lechasney an associate and nowadmitted money launderer and 
mike martinez actually mike mullaney a federal agent posing 
as a money broker for probable drug dealers 
swindall was indicted oct 17 on 10 counts of lying to a federal 
grand jury each of which carries a penalty of 10 months to five 
years in prison the indictment contends he lied in concealing from 
the grand jury his discussions on how the movement of money would 
be concealed to protect him 
swindall a twoterm republican congressman from atlantas 
eastern suburbs lost his seat last november to democrat ben jones 
an attempt at a speedy trial before election day collapsed after 
jurors received swindall campaign material proclaiming his 
innocence in the mail 
in the brief the prosecution says it wants to enter as evidence 
statements swindall made in later interviews and news conferences 
which are clearly false as shown by a taperecorded phone 
conversation between the congressman and the agent 
at one point in that conversation the agent posing as a broker 
funneling swindall money through lechasney as middleman asked the 
congressman what he would say if anyone started asking questions 
whats wrong if i say i sold the note to someone charles 
lechasney introduced me to and i dont know what his name is and i 
really didnt care swindall replied 
theres no question in this transaction that i am basically 
using charles as my buffer swindall said in another conversation 
related in the prosecution brief 
swindalls attorney wants to prevent any use of postgrand jury 
statements by the congressman on the grounds that they are not 
relevant to the issue of whether he lied to the panel 
us district judge richard freeman unsealed several motions and 
trial briefs after objections from news organizations but two 
other government briefs must remain secret because they contain 
highly sensitive information not previously reported in the 
media he said 
since potential jurors might read or hear new news reports 
there is a substantial chance that reporting on the sensitive 
information might taint the jury freeman ruled 
the judge set aside monday for 75 potential jurors to fill out 
questionnaires and for lawyers on both sides to study them 
courtroom questioning of the potential jurors is expected to begin 
tuesday 
freeman has said he wants to see if an impartial jury can be 
seated before ruling on swindalls request to move the trial out of 
town because of prejudicial publicity

two men accused of helping stage the 
states biggest bank robbery go on trial tuesday in a case in which 
authorities say one witness was murdered another died of unknown 
causes and jailed suspects plotted to kill other witnesses and flee 
to the cayman islands 
ive been wracking my brain trying to find a way to summarize 
it for the jury said assistant us attorney ben bryant 
these people are just too zany bryant said of the 
defendants theyve been watching too much television 
john p mccoy 43 of slaters branch ky and doyle david 
moore 27 of lovely ky go on trial tuesday in us district 
court in huntington on charges of conspiracy to commit bank robbery 
and intimidating witnesses 
mccoy also faces a murder charge in the shooting death of 
russell m davis of martin county ky who was part of the robbery 
gang 
the matewan national bank in kermit was robbed of more than 
286000 on jan 3 1987 authorities say mccoy masterminded the 
heist in which he was joined by moore davis and harold d 
boonie runyon 39 of forest hills ky 
davis met with secret service agents in jacksonville fla 
shortly after the robbery and agreed to become a government 
witness a few days later authorities say runyon and mccoy took 
him to the top of a kentucky mountain and shot him in the head 
he was a threat to us runyon said friday in pleading guilty 
to the davis killing and to a charge of conspiracy to commit 
robbery there was no reasoning with him we took him to a hill 
and shot him 
runyon said he and mccoy buried davis in a shallow grave on ford 
mountain in pike county ky the body was not discovered until last 
february 
mccoy moore and runyon were indicted by a federal grand jury in 
march in the robbery and a murder charge later was added against 
mccoy and runyon moore was not charged in the davis killing 
runyon who had been scheduled to stand trial with mccoy and 
moore could be sentenced to life in prison on the murder count and 
five years for the robbery charge plus 500000 in fines 
earlier this month timothy lynn sammons 30 of beauty ky a 
friend of davis who appeared before the grand jury was found dead 
in his car martin county coroner jay hinkle said monday the cause 
of death still has not been determined but said foul play is not 
suspected 
mccoy runyon and four others including mccoys son were 
charged may 6 in an alleged plot to break mccoy runyon and another 
man out of jail kill five witnesses and help the prisoners flee to 
the cayman islands in the caribbean 
prosecutors said the six asked an imprisoned burglar to kill the 
trial witnesses and then help them break out in return for 20000 
in cash and 100000 in counterfeit money

the environmental protection agency routinely 
understates the severity of the smog problem in urban areas because 
it relies on too few monitoring devices a private environmental 
group said monday 
the natural resources defense council said that in many large 
american cities unhealthy levels of smog are twice as frequent 
during the hot summer months as epa estimates would indicate 
last march the epa released 1988 air pollution figures that 
showed ozone pollution which is a chief component of urban smog 
as being the worst in a decade and clearly the most pervasive air 
pollution problem the country faces 
the agency indicated nearly 100 areas of the country have 
unhealthy levels of ozone pollution during at least some periods of 
the summer 
nevertheless according to the environmental group those epa 
statistics reflect only a fraction of the ozone pollution problem 
according to the nrdc 
the environmental group said the epa estimates of days in which 
there are unhealthy levels of smog in an area are often based on 
smog readings from a single monitor 
this approach seriously underestimates the extent of the smog 
problem in most large urban areas said david hawkins an 
attorney for the environmental group and a former assistant 
administrator at the epa 
epa officials could not immediately be reached for comment on 
the nrdcs assertions 
hawkins said that an analysis conducted by the nrdc showed that 
unhealthy levels of smog occurred about twice as often in many 
american cities than the epa statistics suggest 
in urban areas in most parts of the northeast and across some 
areas of the southeast and texas smog levels were found to be 
considerably worse than implied by the epa reporting he said 
hawkins said the group counted the number of smoggy days in 
1987 and 1988 in 48 large urban areas and found the levels higher 
than the epa suggested based on its monitoring system 
for example according to the nrdc the houston tex 
metropolitan area had 54 smoggy days compared with 21 cited by the 
epa during the time period washington dc had 18 instead of 
the epa figure of 105 and cincinnati had nine instead of the two 
in the epa report

minister gareth evans and environment minister graham richardson 
supporters of the proposed convention on the regulation of 
antarctic mineral resource activities drawn up last year in

taiwan should halt all contacts with china 
until it lifts martial law and acknowledges that the 
antigovernment demonstrations are patriotic and democratic 60 
legislators said in a statement monday 
the lawmakers from the governing nationalist party said we 
should suspend our policy of opening up toward the mainland until 
the chinese communists lift martial law and end any military 
crackdown 
they said they will submit their statement to the legislative 
yuan parliament for discussion tuesday and then relay it to the 
cabinet 
hu chinheng a 35yearold clerk at the ministry of 
communications in taipei began what he said would be a threeday 
hunger strike to protest taiwanese indifference to 
demonstrators in china who are demanding democratic reforms 
students at some universities in taiwan have signed petitions 
supporting the demonstrators in china but there have been no large 
rallies 
people protesting the chinese government actions rallied monday 
in the netherlands and australia 
about 150 chinese students living in holland staged a peaceful 
protest in front of the chinese embassy in the hague 
dutch foreign minister hans van den broek advised dutch 
nationals not to travel to china because of the unrest his warning 
followed the weekend cancellation of a planned state visit to china 
by queen beatrix and her husband prince claus 
hundreds of chinese students in australia held rallies in sydney 
and melbourne 
about 300 demonstrators crowded into the courtyard of the 
chinese consulate in sydney some burned photographs of chinese 
premier li peng 
police blocked the entrance to the consulate building there was 
no violence 
a similar rally was held in melbourne where demonstrators 
called for the removal of li peng and chinas senior leader deng 
xiaping and the lifting of martial law 
the foreign ministry in canberra told australians planning trips 
to beijing to wait until the situation becomes clear 
the taiwanese legislators said the nationalist government should 
offer to open direct trade and shipping links with china if china 
cancels the crackdown and accepts the protests as patriotic and 
democratic 
the nationalists fled to taiwan in 1949 when they lost the civil 
war to the communists the islands government has refused to have 
any direct contacts with the mainland authorities 
but in the past two years it has followed a flexible policy that 
allows taiwanese and chinese to exchange visits and trade through 
third countries 
legislator huang chuwen who initiated the statement to the 
government said a military crackdown could set back democracy in 
china by 20 years and we would miss a good opportunity to reunite 
peacefully 
the nationalists say china and taiwan considered a chinese 
province by both the nationalists and communists should be 
reunited under a democratic system martial law was lifted in 
taiwan in 1987 after it had been in force for 38 years

testimony began monday on a federal 
lawsuit filed in 1973 alleging that the navy discriminated against 
black civilian workers in promotions at jacksonville naval air 
station 
us district judge howell w melton is hearing the nonjury 
trial which may involve up to 450 witnesses and 4000 exhibits in 
the case that became a classaction suit after it was filed 
attorneys for both sides estimated the trial may take up to 12 
weeks melton said if it is not over by the end of june he will 
have to recess it until september because of other court business 
the lawsuit was filed by six blacks in 1973 after their 
complaints were rejected by their bosses one of the six workers 
has died since the lawsuit was filed 
ten years after the case went to court it was declared a class 
action with the outcome potentially affecting 1200 to 1700 
blacks who work or have worked at the navy aviation depot formerly 
the naval air rework facility 
to win lawyers for the naacp legal defense and education fund 
inc must prove there was a sweeping pattern of sometimes subtle 
personnel decisions that promoted white workers ahead of more 
qualified blacks 
we think the promotion process is a largely subjective 
procedure when you have that kind of subjective decisionmaking 
discrimination can enter the process said clyde murphy one of 
the lawyers with the national association for the advancement of 
colored people 
the navy has denied any discrimination and also has defended its 
system for evaluating and promoting civilian workers 
if melton decides the navy has discriminated another trial 
would be needed to determine which employees were treated unfairly 
and how they should be compensated the plaintiffs in a subsequent 
lawsuit could seek back pay and promotions murphy said 
its a big case and when you litigate against the federal 
government they have a lot of resources he said 
a variety of reasons are behind the 15year delay since the 
original 1974 trial date 
a major issue has been the changing nature of how civil rights 
employment laws apply to the federal government that resulted in 
years of delay until the us supreme court clarified the 
application of the law murphy said 
in addition the two sides haggled for years over what 
information they were required to give each other government 
attorneys aggressively litigated the case murphy said 
and for several years only one federal judge was available in 
jacksonville and he was required to put criminal cases ahead of 
civil actions

a crime hot line that won a volunteerism award 
from president bush just a month ago is on the verge of closing its 
doors for lack of contributions 
we happen to be one of those thousand points of light that the 
president is talking about that is now about to flicker out said 
georgette watson who runs the dropadime service from an office 
in bostons roxbury section its an operation where when the 
money comes in its just about spent we need serious money 
dropadime has been taking anonymous tips about drugs and other 
criminal activity since 1983 
according to police one in 12 anonymous tips from dropadime 
results in arrests last year the organization received more than 
2000 tips about drug activity gangs and weapons 
in february dropadime passed on a tip about a high school 
student carrying a gun at school the tip led to the arrest of an 
18yearold carrying a loaded 9mm handgun 
we cant afford to lose an orgnization like dropadime 
police commissioner francis m roache said policing in this 
country will never be effective without groups like that the 
information we have gotten from the group has been very fruitful 
and i fully support georgette 
dropadimes original 700 annual budget has jumped to 120000 
as the operation has become more sophisticated but it was down to 
its last dime by the end of march now its organizers are dialing 
for dollars trying to make it through the last two months of the 
fiscal year 
the tip line known officially as dropadime report crime 
intelligence data inc handles between 300 and 600 calls per week 
in april dropadime received a citation signed by bush the 
award was for volunteer action since dropadime has only two 
salaried employees including watson and uses about 10 vista 
volunteers for much of its work 
watson says she will have to decide by the end of this month 
whether to hang up the service for good 
since april ive been paying the small bills out of my own 
pocket watson said 
the organization relies largely on private donations from banks 
and private corporations for its annual budget 
watson said some donors apparently gave to other projects this 
year some have given us less this year and others nothing at 
all i guess some have chosen other issues like homelessness or 
aids she said 
the boston police department also chips in 20000 each year and 
this year provided an emergency infusion of 3000 as cash 
dwindled next years 20000 installment will not come until late 
summer or early fall 
the rev bruce wall a cofounder of dropadime as well as a 
minister and assistant clerk magistrate said he wrote mayor 
raymond l flynn asking him to support a proposal requiring police 
to allocate some assets confiscated in drugrelated arrests to 
groups such as dropadime 
if dropadime has to turn off its telephones because this 
citys public officials failed to support then i am forced 
seriously to question whether the war on drugs is a reality he 
wrote

president corazon aquino said monday 
her government was not strong enough to risk allowing ferdinand 
marcos to return dead or alive 
she has refused to let the ailing 71yearold deposed president 
return from hawaiian exile to die in his homeland and has ruled out 
burying him here 
marcos remained in critical condition monday in a honolulu 
hospital after suffering renal cardiac and pulmonary failure last 
week 
mrs aquino said on monday that the country is recovering from 
20 years of abusive rule by marcos but the recovery is still too 
fragile to risk allowing marcos to come home even in death she 
said 
lets say a person has been ill for 20 years and now after 
three years he is slowly recovering she told reporters just 
because he is growing stronger does not mean you are going to 
expose him to infection 
mrs aquino recalled how antimarcos groups exploited the 1983 
assassination of her own husband benigno aquino jr aquino was 
slain at manila airport moments after returning from the united 
states to challenge marcos 
the killing stirred such outrage it led to the popular uprising 
that toppled marcos in 1986 and forced him into exile 
i appealed for peaceful demonstrations she said i 
appealed to them not to engage in violence will all of marcos 
followers do the same thing we cannot allow anyone to create 
trouble or we will be fighting again we cannot allow these 
things 
the president conferred on the issue monday with her cabinet 
crisis committee and later officials said the ban on the former 
president remained

a teachers strike in los angeles went into a second week monday 
with 11 arrests and a break in talks while negotiators in boston 
agreed on a contract school officials called a landmark in 
educational reform 
the arrests were the most in one day during the walkout that has 
crippled education in the nations secondlargest school district 
they occurred after a rally at which more than 10000 teachers 
hoisted picket signs and cheered wildly when united teacherslos 
angeles president wayne johnson called school board members 
desperate despicable people 
johnson accused board members of lying when they say the 
district cannot afford to meet teachers demands for a 26 percent 
raise over three years including 10 percent in the first year 
the boston teachers union and superintendent laval s wilson 
tentatively agreed on 7 percent pay increases for teachers for each 
of three years despite warnings from officials that the city cannot 
afford it 
the contract which requires ratification by the school 
committee and the union comes at a time when massachusetts gov 
michael s dukakis has proposed tax increases and spending cuts to 
balance the state budget mayor raymond flynn said he did not 
believe money would be available to support the contract but he 
supported provisions aimed at decentralizing school management 
wilson and edward doherty president of the 6000member 
teachers union said the contract would give teachers greater 
control over the schools would reduce the power of seniority and 
would hold teachers more responsible for the performance of their 
students 
in a joint statement wilson and dougherty called the pact a 
landmark union and school officials noted however that it 
was modeled after teachers contracts in dade county fla and 
rochester ny which gave teachers a greater stake in how school 
systems are run 
in los angeles school district police arrested 11 people for 
investigation of roadway obstruction and trespassing during a 
sitin outside district headquarters ten teachers including two 
union vice presidents were arrested along with a 17yearold said 
district spokeswoman tammy sims 
school board president roberta weintraub emphasized after the 
breakdown in talks that the district had boosted its offer of a 
215 percent pay raise over three years to a 24 percent raise over 
three years contingent on extra state funding 
superintendent leonard britton said he did not know why talks 
collapsed sunday night i am led to the conclusion that the 
union and its officials particularly were looking for any reason 
to break it off he said 
education in the district has slowed to a crawl since the union 
representing 22000 of the districts 32000 teachers counselors 
nurses and librarians went on strike may 15 
the district claimed a small gain in student attendance monday 
following a week of losses there were 293482 students in class 
up 34362 from friday the district has more than 550000 students

three senators want president bush to give top 
priority to blocking a return to power in cambodia by the khmer 
rouge the communist group blamed for more than a million deaths 
during its 197378 rule 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the foreign relations 
committee and sens alan cranston dcalif and mark hatfield 
rore sent bush a letter that also urged rejection of a proposal 
for us arms aid to noncommunist guerrillas in cambodia 
the weekend letter obtained by the associated press asked bush 
to settle the debate between two groups of us legislators and 
experts 
both agree the khmer rouge should be stopped from returning to 
power and the argument is whether the various proposals would help 
or hinder this 
we urge you to make unconditional united states opposition to 
the khmer rouge and support for a diplomatic settlement your top 
priorities rather than a new program of us lethal assistance 
the senators declared 
the other side favors arms aid for the noncommunist cambodian 
factions to strengthen their hand in future powersharing 
negotiations 
the state department says us policy is under study white 
house reaction to the senators letter was not immediately 
available 
us policy for settlement of the decadeold war includes 
safeguards against future khmer rouge domination along with 
selfdetermination for the people and total withdrawal of the 
vietnamese military forces that invaded in 1978 
the three senators voiced concern that prince norodom sihanouk 
the wests choice to head a future cambodian state remains 
allied with the murderous khmer rouge 
they added that any military assistance at this time simply 
would reinforce prince sihanouks alliance with the khmer rouge and 
discourage him from attempting to reach a diplomatic settlement 
which excludes the khmer rouge 
we do not need to remind you of the genocide committed by the 
khmner rougenor do we need to remind you that the incredible 
brutality of the khmer rouge continues today in the refugee camps 
its forces control in thailand and inparts of cambodia the 
letter said 
but sihanouks backers have argued that the khmer rouge can be 
controlled more effectively as part of an alliance 
the senators also said any military aid provided sihanouks and 
other noncommunist cambodian groups invariably would fall into 
the hands of the khmer rouge and would also increase civil 
strife

tuesday commemorate the fires lit by the soldiers of simon 
barkochba who led jews in a rebellion against the romans between

plague in which 24000 disciples of the famed rabbi akiva died 
because they did not properly honor one another 
another legend says akivas disciples died fighting the romans 
israeli children often make bows and arrows during the holiday to 
reenact the battle 
police estimated that about 200000 people mostly orthodox 
jews will spend the holiday at mount meron near the northern city 
of safed to celebrate lag baomer with picnics and prayers

more than 100 military leaders said monday they 
will not order their men to confront or suppress the masses of 
people who seized control of the capital to demand democratic 
reform 
student leaders on tuesday considered ending their 10day 
occupation of tiananmen square 
soldiers clashed briefly monday night with residents 15 miles 
from the square but no shooting was reported other troops 
withdrew from streets in southern beijing ending standoffs with 
local residents who have surrounded their convoys and blocked their 
movement 
students who have guided the tumultuous prodemocracy movement 
over the past month expressed concern that many beijing students 
were leaving and that half their numbers were now students from 
outside the city 
beijing university student leader gua haifeng said some leaders 
want to pull out because of the increasingly squalid conditions and 
the lack of clearcut results from the occupation 
others argued they should stay until they achieve victory in 
their struggle with the government stressing that the students 
still have the strong support of city residents 
about 45000 people were on the 100acre square tuesday morning 
a soldier from the western province of xinjiang praised the 
students revolutionary patriotic democratic movement in a 
speech over loudspeakers 
a mother was seen weeping in the arms of her daughter pleading 
with her to come home 
the promise by the military not to attack protesters represented 
a serious blow to premier li peng and other hardliners who have 
tried to quell the huge demonstrations 
sources said members of the national peoples congress chinas 
legislature began gathering signatures needed to convene a special 
session on the legality of martial law indicating a further 
erosion of lis support 
in washington the voice of america said chinese authorities 
were jamming its broadcasts apparently trying to cut off one of 
the demonstrators main sources of information it was the first 
reported case of jamming since before diplomatic relations were 
restored in 1979 
soldiers withdrew from streets in southern beijing to end 
standoffs with residents who had surrounded military convoys for 
the last three days 
army trucks and armored vehicles remained deployed elsewhere in 
western and southern parts of the city but the mood was generally 
relaxed state television quoted an officer as saying he was told 
to withdraw because of the widespread opposition to martial law 
residents and soldiers clashed briefly in one area when the 
soldiers tried to move to a nearby army storage facility 
people surrounding the trucks tried to block their path and a 
battle with rocks and bricks began 
an unconfirmed report said a soldier was killed and one report 
said 15 residents were injured a chinese journalist said about 
2000 soldiers participated in the clash 
the confrontation which ended at about 1 am tuesday occurred 
15 miles southwest of tiananmen square in central beijing where 
tens of thousands of students have held roundtheclock vigils in 
defiance of martial law 
citizens have set up barricades throughout the city to keep 
soldiers from moving on the students 
what caused the clash was not clear witnesses said soldiers hit 
people with sticks and belts but did not open fire the witneses 
said some soldiers pushed through throngs of residents trying to 
block their way but that military vehicles did not advance 
there were new signs of internal political struggle 
the letter from military leaders which was sent to the peoples 
daily the mouthpiece of the ruling communist party was drafted by 
seven prominent military figures a source at the peoples daily 
said the seven include former defense minister zhang and former 
army chief of staff yang dezhi 
as old soldiers we have the following demands the letter 
said the peoples liberation army belongs to the people it 
cannot confront the people even more so it cannot suppress the 
people and it will never shoot the people 
to keep the situation from worsening the army cannot enter 
the city the letter was signed by 100 other officers said 
another source 
lis inability to enforce martial law indicated an intense power 
struggle li emerged as a hardliner during the protests and 
appeared to have won a power struggle with communist party general 
secretary zhao ziyang who was more sympathetic to the students 
demands 
chinese sources said zhao has resigned in protest but no 
official statement has been made and his whereabouts and status 
remain unclear 
the students began leading the protests on april 15 to demand 
talks with the government on bringing democratic reforms and ending 
official profiteering but now the students bolstered by 
widespread support their movement has won from the populace are 
pressing for the resignations of li and senior leader deng xiaoping 
the protests reached a zenith last week during the historic 
visit to china by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev whose social 
reforms are admired by reformminded chinese 
students began a hunger strike may 13 two days before 
gorbachevs arrival the populace embraced the students cause and 
poured into the streets resulting in crowds estimated at more than 
1 million 
under martial law the city government banned marches strikes 
class boycotts the spreading of rumors and any criticism of 
leaders the bans were widely ignored 
foreign reporters were told they could not conduct interviews 
take pictures or make tapes or videos on the streets in work 
places and at several other locations

a record promoter pleaded guilty monday to 
three charges involving payola and admitted giving cocaine to a 
fresno radio employee to win air time for songs by bruce 
springsteen and other artists 
ralph tashjian 41 of san mateo pleaded guilty in us district 
court to a misdemeanor payola charge for sending the cocaine in a 
federal express envelope to the radio station program director 
he also pleaded guilty to two felony charges of filing a false 
corporate tax return and obstructing a grand jury investigation 
tashjian said he sent less than a gram of cocaine to the fresno 
program director to encourage the broadcasts of records by 
springsteen laura branigan and elvis costello 
tashjian was the first person convicted under amended 1960 
payola statutes which outlaw the exchange of gifts for radio time 
said department of justice attorney richard stavin 
three counts of tax violations against tashjians wife valerie 
were dismissed last week 
judge pamela ann rymer agreed with a defense motion that the 
couple was the victim of vindictive prosecution and labeled the 
governments prosecution reprehensible 
as part of a plea agreement other counts in a 175count 
indictment filed against tashjian will be dismissed but tashjian 
must testify before any federal grand juries or trial juries 
defense attorney anthony brooklier said tashjian has not been 
subpoenaed to testify and refused to say if tashjian would testify 
against his exboss record promoter joseph isgro 
the plea agreement also allows tashjian to withdraw his guilty 
pleas if ms rymer sentences him to more than nine years in prison 
and a 265000 fine at his sentencing set for july 31 
the government agreed not to use tashjians testimony against 
him in any future prosecutions unless he has perjured himself or 
unless he withdraws from the plea agreement

the city board of supervisors on monday 
unanimously approved the nations first law allowing livein lovers 
to register their partnerships publicly 
the law which also is intended to extend health benefits to 
domestic partners of city workers was opposed by the roman 
catholic church but hailed by homosexual couples who cannot 
legally marry and heterosexuals lovers who dont want to wed 
the law which passed on a 100 vote with one supervisor absent 
requires a routine second vote may 30 before going to mayor art 
agnos who has promised to sign it 
the supervisors also voted 100 to direct the mayor to form a 
task force to examine how health benefits could be extended to 
domestic partners of city employees 
a few other cities have adopted policies extending health 
benefits to livein lovers of municipal employees but san 
francisco would be the first to allow any nonmarried couples in 
the county to register their relationships like traditional couples 
file marriage licenses 
the declaration of domestic partnership form would be filed 
with the county clerk for a 35 fee 
i hope that other cities around the country will be 
looking at ways to change their laws to reflect the reality of the 
way people live said harry britt president of the board of 
supervisors author of the measure and a leader of the citys 
politically powerful gay community 
britt played down worries by agnos that people from other cities 
might swarm to san francisco to get their relationships 
legitimized he emphasized that the laws benefits would apply only 
to partners of city workers but urged that its spirit be adopted 
in all spheres 
my hope is that people will go to their unions theyll go to 
their employers theyll go wherever in society people are given 
some sort of benefits and be able now to say this is the person 
i love and be dealt with fairly he said 
in addition to health benefits livein lovers of the 25000 
city workers would be entitled to bereavement leave and hospital 
visitation rights 
this is long overdue said scott smith who was the lover of 
harvey milk san franciscos first gay supervisor who was 
assassinated in 1978 our relationships are just as valid as 
nongay relationships 
the law which defines domestic partners as any two people who 
have chosen to share one anothers lives in an intimate and 
committed relationship is not binding on private businesses but 
proponents say the citys policy could lead to changes in many 
areas 
this is only the beginning said matthew coles a lawyer who 
helped draft the law and worked on similar measures adopted in 
berkeley and santa cruz west hollywood also has such a law 
private employers though remain skeptical 
my impression is that companies are not eager to stretch 
benefits that far said richard morten vice president of the san 
francisco chamber of commerce 
the roman catholic church worked against a similar plan vetoed 
by thenmayor dianne feinstein in 1982 the rev george wesolek of 
the archdiocese of san francisco recently called the law a 
frontal assault on marriage and the family as we know it 
deacon norman phillips of the archdiocese said he was not 
surprised by the vote i think our hope would be that they might 
reconsider he said 
the church is opposed to the pseudomarriage provision of 
the legislation although it supports the extension of civil rights 
benefits and health coverage phillips added 
another clergyman said the law would have a positive impact on 
the aids crisis 
we need to support gay couples in stable relationships not 
promiscuous sex said episcopal priest robert cromey 
some of the citys employees worry their healthcare premiums 
could rise if the cost of insuring domestic partners including 
aids patients drains city funds health and insurance officials 
say the newly eligible people will pay their own way with monthly 
premiums of about 150 
in berkeley 75 percent of the citys 1450 employees have 
sought coverage for domestic partners under its health plan 
eightyfive percent of those couples are heterosexual

among the byzantine maneuverings of chinas 
political system one thing is clear power is strictly a party 
affair 
the main premise in chinese politics is that the communist party 
decides and the government does decisions are generally made by 
consensus among party leaders 
the legislature or national peoples congress has little pull 
and direct elections as known in the west are practically 
nonexistent 
the decisionmaking process is made murkier by the role of 
senior leader deng xiaoping 84 deng holds only one official post 
as chairman of the central military commission and has withdrawn 
from an active daytoday role in running the country 
but there has been no question that when critical matters arise 
dengs word is final that ultimate authority may now be on the 
line as opposition grows to the imposition of martial law believed 
done on dengs orders to put down studentled unrest in beijing 
the general course of the nation is adjusted about every five 
years when the 47 millionmember party convenes its national 
congress of about 2000 delegates 
the congress however merely reflects decisions made by the 
175member central committee which meets in full session at least 
once a year and the 17member politburo the nucleus of party 
power 
at the core of this nucleus is the fivemember standing 
committee of the politburo at dengs bidding the standing 
committee is now balanced with two advocates of reform party 
general secretary zhao ziyang and hu qili two more conservative 
politicians premier li peng and vice premier yao yilin and one 
fencesitter qiao shi 
chinas executive wing is the state council led by the premier 
and three vice premiers and including 41 ministers all are party 
members and the ranking officials such as li peng and the vice 
premiers are politburo members despite promises to separate party 
and government functions the party still has a decisive say in a 
broad spectrum of policy areas 
this is even more the case with the national peoples congress 
a body of almost 3000 which meets for about two weeks once a year 
to vote on legislature and formally appoint members of the state 
council it also fills the largely ceremonial post of president or 
head of state now held by retired gen yang shangkun 
the national peoples congress in recent years has tried to shed 
its image as a rubberstamp body by allowing more debate and 
seeking more say in shaping legislature 
the congress or more exactly its 163member standing committee 
which is responsible for its daytoday operations has managed to 
alter or delay some controversial bills 
but senior leadership in the congress called the highest 
organ of state power is again dominated by the party and all 
important legislation emerges from policies set by the party 
under the national peoples congress are peoples congresses at 
various district and provincial levels citizens have a direct vote 
for the lowestlevel county congresses although the candidates 
must generally be approved by the local party offices 
the local congresses consulting with the party appoint 
delegates to provinciallevel congresses who in turn nominate 
delegates for the national congress

two brothers who ran with spy 
christopher boyce went on trial monday in the slaying of the first 
us forest service officer killed in the line of duty and a 
defense lawyer conceded their involvement 
pellets from a shotgun carried by james pratt struck brent 
jake jacobson causing him to bleed to death pratts lawyer 
jonathan cottrell told jurors jacobson was a forest service law 
enforcement officer who helped track the two suspects for 20 hours 
through deep snow 
cottrell said he wouldnt challenge much of the prosecutions 
evidence thus avoiding lengthy technical testimony from fbi 
experts but contested circumstances that would warrant the death 
penalty under state law 
cottrell suggested the defense would try to show that the pratts 
fired in selfdefense at pursuers and that jacobson was acting as 
a volunteer not as a law enforcement officer in the manhunt 
james pratt 29 of indian hills colo and his brother joseph 
27 of sandpoint are charged with firstdegree murder and 16 other 
felony counts stemming from an abortive jan 11 burglary 
the pratts gained notoriety in 1982 when their testimony helped 
send escaped spy christopher boyce back to federal prisonboyce 
whose sale of cia satellite information to the soviets was 
chronicled in the book the falcon and the snowman had escaped 
from prison in california and taken refuge in northern idaho 
cottrell told the kootenai county jury that the pratts were the 
two blackclad figures who burst into a tavern owners home on jan 
11 intent on robbery they briefly took a hostage from among the 
nine people in the home fired shots at a pursuing sheriffs 
deputy and shot it out with jacobson and a deputy when cornered in 
a ravine the evening of jan 12 cottrell said 
if they thought they were master criminals they were kidding 
themselves cottrell said of the robbery that netted little of 
value 
bruce greene representing joe pratt reserved his opening 
statement until after bonner county prosecutor phil robinson has 
presented his case 
robinson said he intends to seek the death penalty if the pratts 
are convicted of murder 
cottrell asked jurors to use your common sense when deciding 
whether the shootout was a continuation of the burglary and robbery 
of the night before or a separate series of crimes 
if the jurors find that jacobson was shot as part of a robbery 
or in his capacity as a lawenforcement officer they could find 
the pratts guilty of firstdegree murder which is punishable by 
death

stefania follini who has spent more than 
four months sealed in a cave learned monday evening that her 
isolation experiment was almost over she heard a human voice 
laughed and said it was like an alarm clock 
minutes after miss follini was notified on a computer screen 
that the experiment would end tuesday she heard another persons 
voice for the first time in four months and nine days 
stefania im your god talking to you experiment 
coordinator maurizio montalbini said over an intercom 
the 27yearold italian woman looked at a video camera trained 
on her laughed and said i didnt think you would find me down 
here 
miss follini woman has been living 30 feet underground since 
jan 13 without sunlight clocks or other ways of measuring time 
on may 4 she guessed it was march 7 though she said she might be 
two weeks off 
montalbini broke the news first by typing it in italian over a 
computer connected to miss follinis 
stefania a real adventure doesnt stop it never ends he 
wrote 
miss follini frowned and watched the screen 
you have lived 130 days in temporary isolation montalbini 
wrote 
miss follini watched the screen stonefaced 
and now the adventure continues montalbini wrote you 
are returning on your trip to eternity 
miss follini continued watching the computer screen 
expressionless montalbini who once spent six months isolated in a 
cave explained to the 40 reporters clustered around two tv screens 
that she was having trouble believing what she was reading 
finally miss follini typed in a reply 
how come she wrote an uncertain smile on her face 
montalbini assured her he was telling the truth the experiment 
was over 
are you really serious miss follini wrote 
montalbini wrote that the end of the isolation experiment meant 
the end of daily boring mental and physical tests with that miss 
follini laughed and clapped her hands and montalbini talked to her 
over the intercom 
after several verbal exchanges with the various italian 
researchers miss follini remarked that the feeling she had was 
like when the alarm clock goes off on monday morning interpreter 
rita fraschini said 
the isolation set a duration record for women the national 
aeronautics and space administration and several us universities 
cooperated with montalbini and other researchers from his and miss 
follinis hometown of ancona italy 
the experiment in 30footdeep lost cave in the hills of west 
carlsbad simulated some of the effects of interplanetary space 
travel 
in the absence of clocks and sunlight miss follinis sleepwake 
cycle has been altered radically she tends to stay awake 20 to 25 
hours and sleep about 10 hours 
miss follinis menstrual cycle hasnt helped her guess at the 
passage of time because it stopped in the absence of light days and 
dark nights researcher andrea galvagno said 
miss follini an interior decorator has coped with the 
isolation by livening up her 10footsquare plexiglas living area 
with colorful figures cut out of construction paper and glued to 
the plastic walls she also reads plays solitaire and keeps in 
shape with calisthenics and judo moves 
monday morning eight hours before she was scheduled to find out 
she was coming out tuesday miss follini appeared to be cutting out 
figures for another poster 
occasionally researchers summon her to perform computerized 
tests of mental power and concentration she also monitors her 
temperature heart rate blood pressure and lung capacity 
for the first three months she was grouchy but she has become 
more cheerful in the past month researchers said

house speaker jim wrights televised defense 
against ethics charges this week will be that the rules were 
changed in midstream but even his own lawyers give him less than 
an even chance of winning quick dismissal of the case 
wrights lawyers will argue that the two most serious sets of 
charges brought against their client by the house ethics committee 
should be dismissed because the panel reacting to a new moral 
climate has stretched the rules beyond their original intent 
we are hoping for a clear interpretation that the rules 
havent changed on us wright said 
but wrights lawyers concede such motions are routinely denied 
and give the speaker less than even chance of winning a preemptive 
dismissal of the charges

americans would accept an array of encroachments 
on their lives to help clean up the environment such as a ban on 
aerosol cans and mandatory household recycling a poll has found 
the media generalassociated press survey of 1084 adults found 
broad perceptions that environmental pollution is on the rise and 
that government businesses and average americans are not doing 
enough to combat it 
threequarters of the respondents said laws against pollution in 
the united states are too weak and majorities favored urgent 
government action no matter what the cost to protect the nations 
drinking water 
large majorities also supported strict pollution controls at all 
major oil facilities and at oil and coalburning power plants

three months after the last soviet 
soldiers left the government is showing increasing confidence it 
can ultimately force moslem guerrillas and their supporters 
especially the united states to talk peace 
western countries had predicted the mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors would overwhelm the afghan armed forces within weeks or 
at least a few months of the soviets departure on feb 15 
although these predictions have not come true the united states 
has rebuffed proposals by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev for 
a mutual cutoff of weapons and steppedup efforts for a ceasefire 
they say we should give the mujahedeen more time but they 
have had time and they have nothing to show they have no power 
they can only fire rockets foreign minister abdul wakil said 
he said president bush should accept that the guerrillas will 
not bring down the sovietbacked government and that a negotiated 
peace is the only policy consistent with the principles espoused by 
the united states

spoleto festival usa is like a 
wedding and each spring this historic city revels in a twoweek 
honeymoon with the performing arts 
like any good wedding this years 13th edition of spoleto 
boasts something old something new something borrowed and if not 
blues at least plenty of hot jazz 
the mix of the festival is provocative without being onesided 
from an aesthetic point of view says festival general manager 
nigel redden but if we arent provocative if we arent 
challenging every year the festival will lose its audience 
the spoleto curtain rises friday may 26 at noon with a round 
of speeches on the steps of charleston city hall sixteen days and 
111 performances later spoleto closes with a thundering fireworks 
display over middleton place plantation 
this season the old includes productions of bellinis opera 
la straniera and soldout performances of mozarts popular 
the marriage of figaro the latter directed by festival founder 
and artistic director gian carlo menotti 
among the new productions is laurie andersons music theater 
work entitled empty places in which 10000 images will be 
juxtaposed to music on more than a dozen moveable screens at the 
gaillard municipal auditorium 
the something borrowed is a return engagement of the popular 
colla family marionettes from italy who performed at the festival 
years ago the handcarved puppets similar to those menotti 
enjoyed as a child return in two new performances 
the jazz lineup includes among other performers the ramsey 
lewis quartet and the hank jones trio 
with ticket sales running 30 percent ahead of last season 
tickets for the marriage of figaro sold out two days after the 
box office opened in march redden predicts another boxoffice 
record for spoleto 
i hope it reflects on the festival generally he said 
certainly i think people are learning to trust what we do 
we do have a very eclectic offering at the same time were 
doing an 18thcentury and a 19thcentury opera were also doing an 
absolutely brandnew 20thcentury opera with laurie anderson 
with several major productions scheduled to go on the boards at 
gaillard a structural engineer was brought in to make sure the 
grid above the stage could support the weight of the numerous heavy 
sets 
while there was no problem with the stage problems were found 
with the traditional release of heliumfilled balloons during the 
festivals opening ceremonies the multicolored balloons will not 
float skyward this year because of concerns sea turtles mistake 
deflated balloons for jelly fish and try to eat them 
instead redden said the festival is working on a way to drop 
oxygenfilled balloons onto the crowd from above 
other highlights of the festival include 
academy awardwinning actress eileen heckart and tonywinner 
joanna gleason in the lee blessing play eleemosynary the 
story of three generations of women and their attempts to 
communicate with one another 
dangerous games a dance theater production with music by

east german claims to channel waters 
off this lucrative polish port have frayed the frontier of 
friendship that separates the east bloc neighbors 
officials on both sides say a solution is near but the two 
countries still carefully stake out their turf on the wide beach 
west of the port and border guards in towers atop the dunes keep 
watch over a rusty barbedwire fence signs warn strollers 
but even marking buoys have not prevented a fierce squabble over 
sovereignty of the channel which winds back and forth from the 
high seas to the port in order to avoid sandbars and shallows 
the port of swinoujscie straddles the narrow opening to a bay 
that leads to polands largest port szczecin 40 miles to the 
south on the odra oder in german river 
the conflict erupted in 1985 after east germany extended its 
territorial waters by 12 miles and started to enforce its claim to 
parts of the channel approach to swinoujscie that had been under 
polish administration 
negotiations have been going at least since october 1987 while 
both sides say an agreement is near concerns over the issue still 
run strong on the polish side 
east german coast guard cutters have closed in on ships that 
allegedly strayed out of polish waters warning them over bullhorns 
they were violating east german territory said jozef chabowski a 
department director at the polish shipping company 
we were facing the problem that east germany said we were 
operating on waters they claim dont belong to us so the issue 
must be settled it was a show of authority from their side to 
the ships he said 
but he added that the incidents have been less frequent in the 
past year 
the dispute arose at about the time poland made public plans to 
open a dutyfree zone in swinoujscieszczecin while east germany 
was investing heavily to build up its baltic port at rostock 80 
miles to the west 
jozef stebnicki of the maritime office that handles shipping 
complaints said recreational sailing craft had been affected and 
boleslaw stolowicz chairman of the certa fish cooperative said it 
was a problem for deepsea fishing companies 
talks at the highest level on the dispute took place last june 
when polands gen wojciech jaruzelski met erich honecker the east 
german leader in the former german city of wroclaw a government 
spokesman at that time said an agreement was near 
ten months later the problem lingers though in april the east 
german and polish foreign ministers said a bilateral agreement will 
soon be signed that satisfies both sides 
we here in the western territories of poland are especially 
sensitive to these problems because of the most recent history 
said jerzy timen an editor at the szczecinbased weekly newspaper 
morze i ziemia sea and earth 
timen who has written extensively on the dispute said polish 
authorities were not interested in heating up the conflict and that 
officials censored articles in his newspaper that tried to put the 
conflict in a national and international context 
everyone was talking about it but articles didnt appear 
although you could sneak certain problems into professional or 
factory publications he said 
but polish underground newspapers from the area reported 
extensively on the dispute and said that polish vessels at one 
point were being stopped and inspected by east germans 
just after world war ii the area around swinoujscieszczecin 
previously german was turned over to poland 
the german towns of swinemuende and stettin became swinoujscie 
and szczecin 
resident germans were forced to leave while polish refugees 
were moved in after having been expelled by the soviet union from 
what before the war had been the eastern part of poland 
as relations between poland and east germany improved in the 
1970s poles and east germans only had to show national identity 
cards to cross the border poles flocked to east germany to shop at 
its better stocked stores 
but after the rise of the independent solidarity trade union in 
198081 east germans required poles to use passports and issued 
poles entrance visas only on the basis of an invitation 
now the majority of germans in the restaurants and on the 
beaches are tourists from west berlin only a twohour drive away 
who benefit from the exchange rate that allows them among other 
things to eat a firstrate dinner for the equivalent of only about

producerdirectorwriter hugh wilson whos 
gone a few rounds with entertainments movers and shakers smiled 
at the opportunity presented to him in his new cbs series about 
hollywood the famous teddy z 
wilsons last show the critically acclaimed franks place 
was summarily dumped by cbs he doesnt use the word revenge but 
he says he does expect to take a few shots in his new series 
premiering in the fall 
jon cryer pretty in pink stars as a mailroom clerk at a 
big talent agency who suddenly finds himself representing the 
agencys biggest star 
its a cinderella story wilson said a kid gets an 
enormously lucky break and we show how he deals with it his 
naivete and inborn honesty seem to work for him in a business where 
theres no naivete and little inborn honesty 
its a fun little way for me to get even with some people the 
public thinks are wonderful and that we know are monsters 
wilson was the creator of wkrp in cincinnati which ran on 
cbs in 197882 the shortlived easy street on nbc in 198687 
and the police academy movie series 
he also wrote and directed rustlers rhapsody a sendup of 
singing cowboy movies and burglar 
after burglar i realized i could do better work with a 
freer hand in television and that i wouldnt be pigeonholed as i 
was in films wilson said you have more people telling you 
what to do in films than you do in television id like to do more 
movies but what id like to do are terrific movies 
franks place which made its debut in september 1987 was 
one of the most critically acclaimed series of that season but 
that was the year of the dramedy a hybrid between comedy and 
drama and neither cbs nor the audience knew what to do with it 
the sophisticated show was given an 8 oclock eastern time 
period when it should have been on no earlier than 9 then it was 
bounced around the schedule and taken off the air with the promise 
of a return it never did 
other dramedies got similar treatment nbc sporadically 
aired the days and nights of molly dodd then dropped it and 
abc canceled the slap maxwell story 
wilsons newest offering has gotten a better time slot 930 on 
monday sandwiched between the successful murphy brown and 
designing women 
i couldnt believe it when they put franks place in at 8 
oclock he said they also put wkrp in at 8 and the only 
time it was a big hit was when they moved it to 9 oclock its now 
a huge success in syndication which proves my theory that people 
like the show but that it was in the wrong time slot 
wilsons new show is loosely based on a real incident that 
occurred about 30 years ago a mailroom clerk was sent to pick up 
the agencys newest star and when he returned the actor insisted 
he be made his agent the erstwhile clerk soon represented the 
biggest names in hollywood 
wilson said the famous teddy z is a fishoutofwater story 
hes a guy who has no idea what he is doing he said he 
lives in torrance and his mother thinks he must be dealing dope 
to make so much money shes very suspicious of beverly hills the 
show is a sendup of celebrities 
wilson began in the advertising business in atlanta then came 
to hollywood to go into films 
in 1971 i raised 40000 and tried to make a lowbudget 
feature he said i wrote it acted in it and never finished it 
so nobody knows how bad it was 
i came out here and through two friends jay tarses and tom 
patchett met grant tinker he agreed to take me on as a director 
trainee but i saw that in the comedy series the most important 
person was the head writer the first thing i wrote was a bob 
newhart show 
tinker was then head of mtm enterprises and tarses and patchett 
were producing the bob newhart show tarses most recently 
produced molly dodd and slap maxwell patchett created

from a condors perch on this gorge in 
southern peru you could look down on 10 of new yorks world trade 
center towers stacked end on end 
the 60milelong colca canyon formed by the colca river is the 
deepest land gorge on earth according to the guinness book of 
world records 
this mysterious land of desertdry moonscapes exotic 
vegetation active volcanoes and scattered precolumbian ruins is 
just now emerging from obscurity 
the canyon and surrounding colca valley are home to thousands of 
indians descendants of preinca tribesmen who settled here 3000 
years ago 
the whole history of peruvian man is summarized in this 
startling landscape which until only a few years ago was 
incommunicado with the rest of peru wrote the peruvian novelist 
mario vargas llosa in the foreword to the recently published 
discovering the colca valley one of the few books on the 
region 
terraced fields painstakingly carved from the slopes still yield 
corn and potatoes the indians traditional staples ancient 
irrigation canals keep the land productive 
some farms and hamlets rest precariously on canyon ledges 
giving the appearance of defying gravity or tempting fate 
most indians still build their homes from adobe or rocks and 
rely on the wool of their alpaca herds for clothing 
they share these cloudswept highlands with andean condors and 
scores of rare flora and fauna such as giant cactuses and the 
guanaco an elusive cousin of the llama 
from surrounding mountain ridges the colca plummets 14339 feet 
to the colca river according to guinness the world trade center 
in new york is 1350 feet high 
the opposing lower wall descends 10607 feet nearly double the 
depth of arizonas grand canyon 
spanish conquistadors reached the colca in the mid1500s they 
built churches and towns atop indian villages and then left said 
mauricio de romana one of the authors of discovering the colca 
valley 
americans robert shippee and george johnson led an expedition 
into colca and published an article in the january 1934 issue of 
national geographic calling it a lost valley of the incas 
it was a brief interlude in the obscurity of the colca whose 
wonders stayed forgotten until a gravel road was forged in the 
mid1970s linking it with arequipa 115 miles south 
arequipa perus second largest city is 545 miles southeast of 
lima 
to the surprise of peruvians and foreigners alike this 
important setting full of history and culture appeared to the 
world romana said in an interview 
the road brought change to the indians traditional 
selfsufficient lifestyle tourists and spreading fame 
the guinness book recorded the colcas depth for the first time 
in the mid1980s romana said 
the road now carries travelers on a rugged fivehour journey in 
the shadow of the andes majestic spine across the barren and cold 
altiplano and skirting volcanic cones 
the canyon rim offers a birds eye view of walls plunging 
thousands of feet to the rushing colca river and of condors gliding 
on thermal winds over farms and villages 
the most dramatic places are several days farther by foot and 
mule and are seen by just a hearty handful of the 10000 to 15000 
tourists who reach the colca yearly according to romana 
anthony holley an arequipa guide said some visitors are 
discouraged because they cannot easily reach the deepest zone 
the arduous journey by road a shortage of lodgings and 
generally unsafe conditions signal some of the major problems 
facing peruvian tourism 
in the last several years peru has been hit by spreading social 
and economic chaos fueled by its worst recession of the century 
tourism officials say the country does not have the money to 
invest substantially in tourism infrastructure or even protect what 
already exists 
but officials say the colca so far seems to have been spared 
from a recent upsurge in highway banditry and the bloody guerrilla 
insurgency plaguing many other areas of the country 
romana a director of the colca foundation which seeks to 
preserve the zone said the arrival of the modern world has not yet 
had a serious impact on the colca or its people

it seems only logical just plain common 
sense when diplomats strike a deal to eliminate some weapons the 
soldiers who have been manning them wont have to do so any more 
so with the united states scrapping intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles in western europe under an arms control treaty with the 
soviet union the american troops assigned to the missile units 
ought to be coming home 
right said rep andy ireland of florida 
wrong said the pentagon 
when ireland advanced his proposition the other day he said he 
was left feeling like the skunk at the garden party 
it turned out the defense department wasnt planning on pulling 
any us forces out of europe just because of the missile treaty 
the missile personnel would just stay put and get new assignments 
ireland a republican who prides himself on a hawkish record on 
defense legislation said the military is playing kind of a shell 
game 
when he first raised the manpower question he was told about 
25000 us personnel are on assignments that will be eliminated by 
the inf treaty this meant the assignments would go not the 
manpower after the congressman said he had in mind recalling them 
from europe there was some delay followed by a new reduced 
pentagon estimate of the number involved more like 5000 
ireland said the real count probably is about 16000 us 
personnel on european assignments that will be obsolete under the 
inf treaty 
in any event he was told most of them were supposed to be 
doing something else anyhow they had been diverted from other 
assignments to missile duty all because congress was so stingy 
with manpower now they can get back to whatever it was the 
services wanted them doing in the first place 
congress may decide otherwise 
ireland and rep pat schroeder dcolo are sponsoring a 
legislation to have us personnel assigned to the 
intermediaterange missile units pulled returned to the united 
states when the weapons are eliminated 
that wouldnt make a big dent in the 325000 us troops still 
stationed in europe but ireland said it would at least send a 
message to us allies in europe that they have to pay a bigger 
share of defense costs weve got to leave the check on the table 
one time and let the europeans pick it up he said 
but the armed services dont want cuts a defense official told 
a house hearing last thursday that the military is at work on a 
variety of proposed missions for the missile bases the treaty 
renders obsolete 
we have made significant progress in the identification of new 
missions said john a woodworth deputy assistant secretary of 
defense for international security policy 
no specifics he said thats classified 
those overseas bases have remarkable staying power since they 
are missionshopping while congress finally has swallowed some 
politically unpopular cuts in domestic military bases 
woodworth said there were 14562 army and air force slots in 
europe on intermediaterange missile assignments that will be 
eliminated by the fall of 1990 
but he said only 5685 of them are going to be withdrawn from 
europe he said the rest will be reassigned to requirements that 
could not be accomplished earlier and to needed enhancement of 
our european defense posture 
to deal with congressional insistence that the inf missile cuts 
be accompanied by real cuts in personnel and costs the current 
plan is to have about 8000 slots cut in the united states instead 
of in europe 
those manpower reductions would show up in the rosters of fort 
carson colo 
ireland said estimates of defense savings made possible by the 
inf treaty range as high as 2 billion but he said theyll never 
be realized if the personnel involved are squirreled away in 
other european posts 
but the starting point assumption seems to be that american 
troops will stay in europe in about their current number for the 
foreseeable future 
ireland says its become a sort of entitlement program like the 
domestic social programs in which the law says wholl get benefits 
automatically and usually permanently 
the question of sharing that defense burden is among the issues 
waiting for president bush as he journeys to brussels next week for 
the 40th anniversary nato summit meeting

juan carlos zamudio says he 
believes in presidentelect carlos saul menem the newest heir to 
juan d peron 
he has the same thoughts as peron zamudio said he 
understands the feelings and the pain of the people 
zamudio a 39yearold former custodian who uses a wheelchair 
is one of the 79 million argentines who voted for menem and the 
peronist party in the presidential election may 14 and said he is 
convinced that if menem is made aware of a problem he will fix it 
zamudio wants the government to refurbish a hospital that peron 
opened 40 years ago but later fell into disrepair and now is closed 
but menem the 58yearold governor of la rioja province is a 
new and still largely unknown face of peronism zamudio may have to 
wait for the hospital 
menem still is tied to organized labor that has been the 
backbone of the party for 40 years but insists at no point did we 
make promises to anyone except to provide work work and more 
work 
the new peronist will have a severe economic problem to deal 
with when he takes office dec 10 one of keeping the country from 
sliding into economic and social chaos and the policies of the old 
peronism are not apt to work to that end in todays argentina 
argentines who didnt vote for menem accepted his victory with 
resignation 
the peronist party used to say it could solve everything in 
two or three months said alejandro nunez a lawyer menem is 
saying its going to take two or three years its good he says 
that because its going to take at least that long 
the first real insights into how menems peronists will 
government are not likely until he names his cabinet in june and 
when he presents his own economic program and takes responsibility 
for it 
argentinas 59billion foreign debt on which 35 billion in 
interest is overdue will be a chief concern peronist economists 
selected by menem have been assigned to a delegation of president 
raul alfonsins incumbent government for meetings in the united 
states with argentinas creditors 
peronists also have become involved in government actions aimed 
at stabilizing the deteriorating economy which poses perhaps the 
biggest threat to a smooth political transition in december 
menem stresses his party is merely cooperating with alfonsin 
not cogoverning but the political risk is much the same 
politics in argentina for four decades has been polarized by 
love for or hatred of the party founded by juan domingo peron in 
1946 
workers and the poor who receive essential benefits and 
protections are unswervingly loyal 
the great contribution of the peronist party to argentina is 
the incorporation of workers into the national political life 
said italo luder a constitutional attorney and the partys 1983 
presidential candidate 
the middle class and the political right see it as fascist 
authoritarian corporative corrupt incompetent dominated by the 
unions and unable to control the host of movements that gather 
under its banner 
menem has worked to dispel what he calls his partys black 
legend 
peronists were the victims of violence as much as anyone else 
he says reminding argentines that the party had been banned or 
restricted for 25 of the past 34 years and that he was jailed for 
nearly five years following the military coup that ousted perons 
widow isabel from the presidency in march 1976 she had been her 
husbands vice president and succeeded him on his death in 1974 
peronist violence was a response to violence exercised against 
peronism menem has said im not justifying one or the other 
but lets be a little more evenhanded 
but skepticism of peronism remains among argentines who remember 
churches that were burned newspapers that were taken over 
dissidents who were harassed and industries that were nationalized 
by peron 
javier vazquez torrielli 24 a business broker said his father 
took to wearing a gun in 1940s because he wasnt a peronist and 
felt threatened 
mirta candolfi 40 an employee of the state telephone company 
recalls peronists coming into her grammar school and taking down 
the picture of gen jose san martin the father of the country and 
replacing it with perons 
the fear of peronism wasnt invented it stems from peoples 
memories of things that happened said nunez the lawyer 
but even critics say menem seems to accept ideas that the party 
once rejected such as selling off stateowned companies he acts 
on the basis of explanation and compromise and he actively seeks 
and receives public support 
menem has an extreme ability to reach out and put his arm 
around his enemies a diplomat said he draws people in rather 
than pushes people away thats his strategy we have to wait and 
see what the policies will be

this quiet bonedry ravine 
of death overshadowed since antiquity by the valley of the kings 
just over the hills slowly is shedding its mystery 
and with the mystery its name 
ancients called the valley taset neferu the place of beauty 
to the arabs it was gates of the ladies egyptologists and 
guidebooks perpetuate the homage to entombed royal women the 
valley of the queens 
its wrong this valley has been misunderstood and misnamed by 
all egyptologists said christian leblanc field director for a 
continuing 17year frenchegyptian project to record and study its 
history 
we should be calling it the valley of the royal children they 
were here first but the valley became tied only to the queens and 
named by tradition rather than history 
season after archaeological season leblancs team has scoured 
the sloping dusty hillsides dotted with cavelike tombs to find 
the origins of a sequence of burials that would last almost 2000 
years tombs were used repeatedly as late as the christian era 
when pharaonic designs sometimes were plastered over and crosses 
painted on 
leblanc said the first burials were princes and princesses of 
ancient egypts 18th dynasty a 243year renaissance when after a 
period of decline pharaohs and their kin once again lived and died 
like kings 
that dynasty ended in 1307 bc and ramses i founder of the 
19th dynasty changed tradition by burying his queen satre here 
leblanc said its unclear why he did or why the practice 
continued in addition to queens royal children still were buried 
here and concubines who cared for them and pharaohs mothers 
paintings in some of the tombs show hathor the goddess of women 
and love emerging from a grotto that dominates the valley leblanc 
said perhaps this indicates that religion brought the ancients 
here because hathors realm also included the cemeteries on what 
is called the west bank across the nile from presentday luxor 
the 18th dynasty when the graveyard for royal children began 
was a time when queens traditionally shared their pharaohs tombs 
in the valley of the kings many of ancient egypts greatest rulers 
were buried there along with the young pharoah tutankhamun whose 
treasurefilled tomb was discovered by howard carter in 1922 
that discovery brought international fame to the valley of the 
kings hundreds of other royals and officials also were buried on 
the west bank but to the world the glory of the pharaohs meant 
the valley of the kings not the valley of the queens the valley 
of the monkeys or the tombs of the nobles 
for tourist agencies the valley of the queens became an 
afterthought a place to fill a halfhour after an exhausting visit 
to the valley of the kings 
when the joint expedition began 78 burial places had been found 
in the limestone hillsides enclosing the valley today 98 are known 
we couldnt understand the cemetery before because we were 
working tombbytomb leblanc said today weve uncovered all 
the major tombs and have returned the valley to the way it would 
have looked when burials began 
for the first time we can write its history 
as leblanc talked he and fathy hassanein director of the 
egyptian antiquities organizations national documentation center 
walked through scores of excavators digging toward the valleys 
bedrock the job at hand was almost done another tomb uncovered 
from rubble that has obscured the cemetery for most of its 
existence 
an aim of the project is to restore tombs in the valley so that 
more can be opened to tourists fewer than six are now 
the valleys most beautiful tomb the fabulous burial chambers 
of ramses iis powerful queen nefertari is among those so 
deteriorated that they remain offlimits more than half its 
paintings of the elaborately dressed and coiffured queen have been 
destroyed by natural forces 
leblanc said one source for the valleys history has been 
tidbits left by workers who built and decorated the tombs for 
generations they lived in a village inside the valley their 
records on papyrus provided the team not only with answers but 
with mysteries 
workers recorded the construction of tombs for queen isis 
nefret one of ramses iis many wives and a queen named 
duatinypet 
leblanc said they might have been same person but where are 
they 
he also is intrigued by a lack of burial objects or pieces of 
the queens mummies 
this is strange he said did those who came afterwards 
destroy them he added that it could mean another royal cache 
exists perhaps mummies of queens and children 
typical of the tales leblanc has faced in rewriting a new 
history for the valley is the story of a mummified fetus inside the 
tomb of 9yearold prince amonhirkhopshef son of ramses iii 
local guides tell fascinated visitors that ramses queen became 
so distraught over the death of their son that she miscarried and 
the mummies of both amonhirkhopshef and the fetus were entombed 
the story is nonsense leblanc said 
early this century the italian excavator ernesto schiaparelli 
found the fetus in a rubbish pile outside the valley of the queens 
it was schiaparelli not ancient priests who placed it inside the 
princes empty sarcophagus 
today the mummified fetus is so popular a tourist attraction 
that it has its own tiny case

on april 6 1988 grammywinning guitarist larry 
carlton walked out of his california recording studio and into a 
gunmans bullet he believed he was going to die 
i hit the floor and then i prayed i was ready to go to 
heaven said carlton a bornagain christian and ill bet you 
that bought me some time i think that kind of faith was a real 
positive thing 
carltons faith and the frantic efforts of doctors who 
repaired his severed carotid artery saved his life since then 
carlton has made an incredible recovery and returned with a new 
album on solid ground and an upcoming world tour 
but music is not carltons only business these days hes also 
established a fund to aid crime victims who need help and have 
nowhere to turn 
none of it seemed possible when he was gunned down by an unknown 
assailant for unknown reasons in the hollywood hills 13 months ago 
the bullet severed a vocal cord and caused damage to his left arm 
the doctors told my wife hell be fine if he lives hell 
play carlton recalled in a voice still raspy from the shooting 
i couldnt see it in the back of my mind i wondered if i was 
ever going to be as good as before 
after seven months of rigorous therapy and medical attention 
carlton picked up the guitar for the first time to see for himself 
if the licks featured on albums by steely dan michael jackson and 
joni mitchell were still within him the answer came one night in 
his studio when carlton settled in to record an instrumental 
version of the derek and the dominoes classic layla for his new 
album 
that part thats on the record is one complete take all the 
way through and theres that one lick in the middle of it thats 
just flying said carlton his voice rising with excitement 
i was real proud and i felt great so that was kind of a 
spark that night i did layla it was like its back its 
back 
confident that he could handle the guitar carlton turned his 
attention to helping innocent people hip a support group he 
founded to aid crime victims in need of financial or other help 
we watch the news and we read the papers and theres victims 
every day carlton said most of us are jaded to it i was 
id be eating my dinner and watching tv and go on with my life 
hip has already started to help recently providing 100 to a 
crime victim left hospitalized by a vicious gang beating carlton 
said 
thats our dream to help people just when they need it he 
said carlton will contribute part of the proceeds of the world 
tour which begins june 31 in buffalo ny toward the fund 
carlton established his credentials as a premier guitarist 
during the 1970s he played on 13 albums with the crusaders worked 
on three joni mitchell albums and contributed guitar work on steely 
dan classics such as kid charlemagne and josie 
his fretwork was featured in more than 3000 sessions including 
appearances with john lennon linda ronstadt and barbra streisand 
along the way there were two grammy awards and another five grammy 
nominations 
but in the early part of this decade carlton put out the word 
he was through with session work i just started realizing that i 
wasnt looking forward to going to work in the morning and when i 
realized i wasnt looking forward to making my sessions rather 
than continue doing them and take the money i quit 
since them carltons solo career has progressed steadily 
peaking in 1987 with his acclaimed last nite album and its 
single minute by minute the shooting interrupted work on a 
followup album and instantly changed his priorities 
im one of the fortunate ones said carlton im going to 
live and im going to continue to make a living and make my music 
helping innocent people was born because we realize that it was 
born out of that philosophy to help the less fortunate out

in el centro calif three years ago the final eight games of 
the season were canceled after a father threatened umpire carl ott 
with a knife 
in terre haute ind a manager clubbed a rival manager with a 
bat and sent him to the hospital before the game even started 
state police had to be called to break up a brawl at the 1972 
little league world series 
little league has had its share of critics over the years but 
its very prosperity indicates to supporters that its benefits 
clearly outweigh its flaws 
most parents who have sat on wooden benches on a lazy summer 
afternoon and watched their own and their neighbors kids enjoy the 
national pastime however ineptly conclude that little league 
cant be all bad 
this is especially true when a man sees his son let a ball go 
right by him in the outfield because he was preoccupied at the time 
blowing dandelion fuzz 
in another game the same father watched the same son get struck 
out four times by a towheaded pitcher with a fast ball you couldnt 
believe his son apparently harbored no ill will toward the 
pitcher however because 10 years later he took her to the senior 
prom the little league after a lawsuit began allowing girls to 
play in 1974 
one of little leagues least vocal but most severe critics is 
sadly carl stotz himself 
i have absolutely no animosity toward anyone working for the 
corporation he saysmany of them are my dearest friends but 
what little league is now is not what i envisioned it to be and i 
do not approve 
stotz feels that commercialization has blurred the neighborhood 
focus of the program which he saw as its heart and its purpose 
he feels this is most evident in the annual world series stotz 
arranged the first one in 1947 as a rather modest tournament 
among allstar teams from three states to draw attention to his 
idea in the early postwar years 
he did not foresee its becoming an international event 
ballyhooed televised and broadcast play by play to places as far 
away as taipei 
he felt he explains that a county championship or state would 
be sufficient aspiration for youngsters a tournament close to 
home and inexpensive financed the same way the leagues are 
financed by local sponsors 
he says he watched neighborhood volunteers replaced on his board 
of directors with celebrities and benefactors through the influence 
of national sponsors 
his critics say he was behind the times a naive innocent who 
didnt realize little leagues potential his supporters say as 
did one williamsport father all my kid wants to do is play in 
the world series all i want him to do is play baseball and have 
fun 
because of these and other philosophical and administrative 
differences stotz was eased out of the little league in 1955 
without bitterness he says i decided it was time to 
surrender he once described what he had given birth to as a 
frankensteins monster 
so he left he took with him however his original little 
league it is not affiliated with little league inc 
the original little league has thrived in williamsport in the 34 
years since stotzs ouster about 150 children including about 25 
girls play on 12 teams in three age groups 
i think our program is a lot better than theirs says john 
white who played in and now directs the original little league 
we dont stress winning as much as they we seem to have a 
more relaxed atmosphere at our games if adults get overly 
boisterous we just tell them politely that this is for the kids 
we play every night monday through friday and at the end of 
the season we play some allstar games with neighboring leagues 
carl often comes down to watch the games the kids love him ask 
for his autograph they still call him uncle tuck 
the field the originals play on is the same one carl stotz 
used to rearrange newspapers and figure out the proper distance 
between bases for kids the field has been improved over the years 
by volunteers it has a fence and scoreboard and dugouts and 
clubhouse and grandstands 
on may 4 1974 the city of williamsport formally dedicated that 
field on memorial park to its honored citizen and put up a sign 
the carl e stotz field 
so uncle tuck still has that 
another honor came to carl stotz on oct 8 1988 the original 
little league threw a testimonial dinner to celebrate its 50th 
anniversary 
last year 
our first season was in 1939 says stotz his penchant for 
accuracy unremitting so we celebrated our 10th anniversary at 
the end of the 1948 season not 1949 count it up use your fingers 
in 1948 i put out a 25page 6by9 booklet with pictures of 
all the boys it brought in lets see here 20059 in 
contributions in excess of printing costs this years 50th 
anniversary of their little league is a year late 
in carl stotzs back yard is a garagesize building which he 
built himself to preserve what he calls my display 
if you drop by he will show you the first little league bat 
you will see snapshots of the first three little league teams no 
different in composition than todays polaroids that decorate 
refrigerators across the land 
you will see handwritten batting records done in pencil instead 
of ballpoint 
you will see an original base it was made of white canvas 
stitched together and stuffed with wood shavings by stotzs sister 
laurabelle the mother of his two nephews who wondered who they 
would play that mother was the first of 750000 yearly volunteers 
who make it all work 
you will see the first little league home plate which stotz cut 
out of a piece of halfinch rubber he found in his fathers 
basement and of all things the pocketknife he used to cut it 
which it appears he couldnt bear to throw away 
i had in mind a traveling display stotz says something 
to take around the country so little league kids could take a look 
at their roots 
speaking of roots you will also find in carl stotzs display 
the brittle remains of the lilac bush that tripped him up in his 
back yard and set him to dream of a better way a dream that became 
little league 
that lilac stump well says stotz after a couple of 
years i went and looked and discovered it was still there so i dug 
it up 
yeah i guess thats one thing i saved on purpose

editors note the opening of the johns hopkins hospital in 
baltimore 100 years ago this month and the hopkins medical school 
four years later greatly influenced the way america trains its 
doctors besides setting the standards of medical education 
hopkins researchers also have made remarkable contributions to the 
practice of medicine in the 20th century

the chief swept into the hospital lobby 
handing his hat coat and books to the waiting crowd dispensing a 
cheery greeting and a wave of his hand 
he led them past the outstretched arms of the 10foot marble 
christ and down the long corridor to the first ward gathering at a 
bed spectators focused their attention on the patient and on the 
chief 
william osler a showman with high forehead and the bold 
mustache of a pirate was in his element he was teaching medical 
students at the bedside and he was making history 
for this was johns hopkins hospital around the turn of the 
century and osler was among a small group of physicians who were 
helping change the way america trained its doctors 
with the opening of the hospital in 1889 and the hopkins medical 
school in 1893 osler and his colleagues became the first american 
medical faculty to demand a college degree from incoming students 
they also put a new emphasis on research and on learning by 
experience 
from the outset johns hopkins embodied a conception of 
medical education as a field of graduate study rooted in basic 
science and hospital medicine that was eventually to govern all 
institutions in the country wrote sociologist paul starr in his 
pulitzer prizewinning book the social transformation of 
american medicine 
as hopkins graduates became professors and scientists all over 
the country and abroad they took a major part in shaping the 
character of medical education and research in the 20th century 
starr wrote 
this month marks 100 years of medicine at johns hopkins medical 
institutions the us postal service planned to issue a 1 johns 
hopkins stamp and the prestigious journal of the american medical 
association dedicated its june 2 issue to new research from hopkins 
the hopkins influence on medicine extends beyond medical 
education in the past century researchers there developed the 
radical mastectomy for breast cancer built the first renal 
dialysis apparatus crystallized insulin and made many other key 
contributions 
the hopkins medical school opened its doors at a time when 
america had some good medical schools but also many poor ones 
medical historian lester s king said in a recent interview 
no national standards yet governed medical education just about 
anybody could get into a medical school somewhere often without 
even a high school education some diploma mills conferred a degree 
in less than a year 
schools had to compete for access to hospitals and clinics where 
students could get some training with patients most schools could 
not offer much bedside experience 
in general american medical schools also lacked laboratory 
facilities and conducted only limited original research germany 
by contrast was leading a scientific transformation of medicine 
that began in the mid19th century fueled by advances in 
microscopy chemistry and physiology 
in america reformers had been pressing for tougher academic 
standards noted university of minnesota medical historian leonard 
g wilson the reformers argued that medical students needed a much 
better background to study medicine effectively at a time of many 
advances in such areas as surgery pathology bacteriology and 
biology 
but some medical school professors opposed raising entrance 
standards it might discourage a natural genius in the art of 
healing they said and a school that raised its requirements 
risked losing students to lessrigorous institutions no small 
consideration at a time when medical schools depended largely on 
student fees 
some of the better schools made major academic improvements 
during the 1870s and 1880s and in 1874 one key reformer told the 
trustees in charge of establishing hopkins hospital and university 
that they had a precious chance to set up a topnotch school of 
their own 
no medical school already organized has anything like your 
opportunity said charles eliot president of harvard university 
the hopkins trustees had some major advantages rather than 
battling entrenched dogma and professors they could start from 
scratch and rather than having to persuade a hospital to let 
students into wards they could make the hospital a teaching tool 
from the beginning 
when it came to opening the medical school however they also 
had a big problem 
as trustees of the estate of baltimore financier johns hopkins 
they were in charge of what was then the largest endowment in 
american history the 7 million hopkins left upon his death in 
1873 was to be used for establishing the hospital and a university 
but even as the hospital opened its doors in 1889 the financial 
prospects for opening the medical school were shaky income from 
the railroad stock that made up the university endowment had dried 
up 
four wealthy welleducated daughters of the trustees offered to 
raise the needed money provided the school would admit women on 
equal terms as men the trustees agreed 
but by december 1892 the women had raised less than half the 
500000 the school needed other medical schools knowing of the 
delay were trying to lure the hopkins medical faculty away 
finally mary garrett a member of the womens committee 
offered to donate the balance for a price the school would have 
to admit only students who had a bachelors degree and a reading 
knowledge of french and german 
the trustees swallowing hard at requirements they feared might 
drive away many prospective students accepted it is lucky that 
we got in as professors osler told a fellow faculty member we 
could never enter as students 
it was a relief when 18 students including three women showed 
up to form the first class

the medical curriculum hopkins provided was marked not so much 
by innovation as by combination of features that had appeared in 
europe and scattered american schools 
it started with a clean slate and a bunch of good ideas and 
good examples said medical historian king of all the american 
schools that were trying to improve medical education hopkins 
went about it with the greatest enthusiasm and effectiveness 
it was an ambitious enterprise even apart from requiring a 
college degree for entry few other schools provided wellequipped 
laboratories in basic science for teachers and students hopkins 
aimed to stress medical research rather than just the passing on of 
existing knowledge 
the idea was to give the world men who can not only sail by 
the old charts but who can make new and better ones for the use of 
others said john shaw billings a civil war battlefield surgeon 
who became a key architect of the medical school curriculum 
hopkins also made a policy of learning by doing both in the 
laboratory and in the hospital with osler as their mentor at the 
bedside students took medical histories of patients performed 
physical examinations conducted routine laboratory tests and 
followed their patients course 
as osler put it the student began with the patient continued 
with the patient ended his studies with the patient using books 
and lectures as tools means to an end 
the school made fulltime jobs out of teaching basic science 
rather than using local physicians to teach part time as most 
other schools did the fulltime idea later extended to 
instructors of medical practice allowed hopkins to go outside the 
local community to lure topnotch faculty members 
eventually the school also offered lengthy training in medical 
specialties to its students who had finished the four years of the 
regular curriculum 
the result of all this was such that in 1901 harvards eliot 
congratulated hopkins university president daniel gilman on a 
prodigious advancement of medical teaching 
among all the changes in the nation of the previous 25 years 
eliot continued there is none greater than that wrought in the 
development of medical teaching and research and these men whom 
you sir summoned here have led the way 
who were those men most attention nowadays goes to the big four 
one was osler who had come from philadelphia to become 
professor of medicine at the school and physicianinchief at the 
hospital the author of a classic medical text osler became one of 
the nations most highly regarded physicians 
joining him was william halsted a shy and excrutiatingly 
meticulous surgeon he became wellknown for such innovations as 
the radical mastectomy for breast cancer and his training of other 
surgeons 
then there was william welch a genial rotund pathology 
professor who became a power behind reforms in medical education 
and stimulated interest in medical philanthropy 
finally there was howard kelly the gynecological surgeon who 
developed and improved that art he took pleasure in quick 
flashy operating one student wrote later hed be in and out 
of the abdomen almost before you knew it all the time talking and 
illustrating what he was doing or about to do 
today kellys operating table serves as a library table its 
thick glass top chipped around the edges 
of the 17 original hospital buildings only three remain hemmed 
in by the modern boxy homes of the modern hospital and medical 
school the old sitting room where osler wrote his famous textbook 
is now split into cubicles by blue room dividers part of an 
administrative office 
the scene today at hopkins would astonish the big four 
faint rock music nudges the quiet of a whitewalled laboratory 
as bert vogelstein 39 holds up a dark gray sheet of xray film 
it shows several series of smudged black lines 
during the days of the big four physicians were just beginning 
to understand cancer as a disease of abnormal cells now the 
smudged lines on vogelsteins film are helping to explain those 
abnormalities they represent an analysis of colon cancer tissue 
suggesting that the tumors arose after normal cells lost protection 
from a gene that suppresses cancer 
in a room crammed with computer display terminals elliot 
fishman 36 narrates a series of ghostly images a skull tumbles 
end over end revealing its inner detail a hip bone sways in its 
pelvic socket like a pendulum a dark blue liver rotates to reveal 
patches of cancer that look like popcorn 
halsted needed a scalpel to peer within patients like this 
radiologist fishman uses sophisticated scanning machines and 
computer power the result is threedimensional images of the 
bodys interior that can be rotated or manipulated helping 
surgeons plan operations well in advance 
victor mckusick 67 arose shortly after 5 am one recent day 
at his baltimore home he drank some coffee read the paper picked 
up a medical journal article and began to dictate into a small tape 
recorder it was time to catalog a new human gene 
when the hopkins medical school was founded the idea of genes 
was not yet generally accepted for the work of austrian monk 
gregor mendel in the 1860s was not yet widely known today 
mckusick maintains a list of human genes accessible by computer 
around the world the entry he dictated before breakfast that 
morning was number 4584 
but while medicine has advanced greatly since hopkins began 
some things stay the same notes hopkins medical historian a 
mcgehee harvey 
a committee that reviewed the hopkins medical curriculum 
recently endorsed the ideas of learning by doing and of not only 
teaching medicine but also emphasizing the importance of creating 
new knowledge harvey said 
its a process of rediscovery he said with a smile they 
rediscovered all the principles that were here when the place 
started

editors note its a free high school for catholic boys 
drawing students from all around new york city and while other 
parochial schools struggle with rising tuitions and dwindling 
enrollments regis high school in manhattan has managed to afford 
5 million in improvements in recent years thanks to the 
generosity of donors largely alumni the school also has managed 
to maintain a standard of academic excellence

the unusual story behind the founding of regis 
high school is captured in the latin words engraved in stone above 
the columns on its classical facade deo et patriae pietas 
christiana erexit 
or as even the most plodding of latin scholars who ever trod 
the corridors of this reknowned jesuit high school might translate 
built by christian piety for god and country 
seventyfive years after a rich widow anonymously gave her 
pastor 500000 to build a free school for catholic boys regis is 
still giving full scholarships to every student it admits 
it draws the cream of the academic crop mainly from parochial 
grammar schools in the five boroughs of new york the surrounding 
threestate suburbs and sometimes even farther afield 
everyone thinks im crazy to come into the city says mark 
mazzetti 14 a freshman who spends three hours a day traveling 
back and forth from princeton nj 
my friends back home think i live here says marty cassidy 
14 a freshman who rises at 530 am to commute with his brother 
a sophomore from new canaan conn 
the journey can take up to two hours each way but i dont 
have any regrets you can do a lot of homework on the train or 
you can just sleep 
for luis taveras 17 a senior who chose regis over the bronx 
high school of science the trip to school is a 30minute subway 
ride from the bronx 
i love it here taveras says when you come from the 
bronx its really challenging to grow up in a different kind of 
world this school is a meeting ground for people from so many 
different backgrounds 
todays 501 regis students are getting their free education 
valued by school officials at over 24000 thanks not only to the 
generosity of the original benefactor and her family who over the 
years gave millions to keep the school running but its 7500 
alumni who in recent years have become major benefactors in their 
own right 
about half the 33 million budget comes from interest on the 
schools investments the rest is raised each year from alumni 
foundations and other sources 
each year the costs go up at least 200000 says the rev 
james j fischer sj the president since 1980 thats not 
going to end 
but while other catholic schools struggle with rising tuitions 
and contracting enrollments regis has been able to pour 5 million 
in recent years into expanding science labs and other major 
renovations of its building on east 84th street two blocks from 
central park the top faculty salaries will hover near 40000 this 
fall 
last years seniors scored an average of 1273 on the scholastic 
aptitude test 369 points above the national average many 
graduates attend select colleges including 84 who went on to ivy 
league colleges in the past four years alone 
more than a third of the students come from families with 
incomes below 30000 a year and 40 percent are the children of 
immigrants from ireland puerto rico china the philippines 
italy cuba haiti and three dozen other countries 
its still very much an immigrants school says the rev 
vincent w hevern sj the school psychologist 
the school largely white for decades now has a 28 percent 
minority enrollment including 60 hispanic students 12 percent 
51 asian 10 percent and 28 black 6 percent unlike many 
parochial schools especially in big cities it does not admit 
noncatholics 
each fall on the first saturday in november about 900 students 
take a standardized admissions test students also are judged on 
their elementary school grades activities and for the finalists 
an interview before the 130 scholarship winners are chosen shortly 
before christmas 
in 1978 nearly 1300 students took the entrance test the number 
fell to a low of 770 in 1987 before rebounding most of those 
admitted score in the top 5 percent on standardized tests a 
common cutoff for the gifted 
regis officials casting a worried eye on the dwindling pool 
talk openly of the possibility of admitting girls some day as all 
jesuit colleges and some 10 jesuit high schools already have done

theres no comparable opportunity for catholic girls in the 
city of new york says the rev frederick j obrien the 
headmaster if the demographics ever became really horrendous 
thats one way to broaden the pool 
obrien will be succeeded as headmaster this summer by the rev 
james f kuntz who has been headmaster of st peters prep in 
jersey city new jersey kuntz a 1966 regis graduate will be only 
the second alumnus ever to run the school 
fischer says he doesnt think regis boysonly status could 
withstand a legal challenge i think someone would crack that 
tomorrow and wed have to take in girls if they got a good lawyer 
the schools two top administrators are two of only a dozen 
jesuits left on the 50member staff a quartercentury ago more 
than half the faculty were jesuit priests or scholastics 
young jesuits halfway through the 13year preparation process 
leading to ordination not a few of them were alumni in fact a 
regis yearbook marking the 50th anniversary in 1964 noted that 
almost 10 percent of its alumni were priests 
but few regians opt for the priesthood these days many of the 
jesuits on the faculty are nearing retirement and their 
replacements are not in sight it has only one scholastic this 
semester and were not sure well get a replacement when he 
leaves says frank walsh the assistant headmaster 
other things have changed at the school there was a time says 
lynda blakinship chairman of the science department when a regis 
student was just a student now hes taking care of the younger 
brothers and sisters cooking the meals doing the wash while the 
mother works in my advanced placement physics class twothirds of 
the guys had jobs 
no longer do students flunk out in droves in the sort of 
educational triage that once characterized many jesuit schools 
latin long the backbone of the curriculum became optional four 
years ago 
while that raised the hackles of some alumni obrien says 
were trying to get needy students in here were bringing in 
kids who very often are the first people in their family to 
complete high school they know no reason to study latin 
while it is no longer producing legions of priests regis does 
inculcate in its students the value of community service 
seniors are required to spend tuesday mornings out as volunteer 
tutors in grammar schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods or 
working in hospitals or nursing homes most seniors are freed from 
all classes during the last trimester to devote full time to such 
pursuits or to work on job internships 
its alumni include several university presidents including 
timothy s healy 1942 of georgetown and joseph a ohare 1948 
of fordham as well as banking executives corporate chieftains and 
judges although rival xavier high school boasts supreme court 
justice antonin scalia 
the alumni rolls are also thick with lawyers who first honed 
their oratorical skills in the classrooms of regis and its hearn 
society a perennial state debating champion 
we still produce more lawyers than anything else obrien 
says if you teach here for a while you understand that it is not 
an accident our kids love to argue 
but the schools bestknown graduate is dr anthony s fauci 
the aids researcher and director of the national institute of 
allergy and infectious diseases whom president bush has called one 
of his personal heroes 
fauci a 1958 graduate remembers fondly his four years 
commuting as a straphanger from brooklyn to the upper east side 
where he encountered an academic excellence that really was 
unmatched in all of the educational experiences ive had since 
then 
regis is now run by a board that includes both lay and jesuit 
members its leaders say it will retain that jesuit character even 
as the numbers of priests on its staff dwindle 
mazzetti the freshman from princeton said his parents have 
been pleasantly surprised at how few demands the school makes for 
money to pay for extracurriculars or anything else 
at my old school they always asked for money for every little 
thing he says 
but an older student who overheard the remark chimed in 
knowingly never being asked for money give me a break wait 
until you graduate

outdoorsman and writer ed zern a 
conservationist with a sense of humor is still spouting the 
oneliners that have endeared him so long to so many anglers 
i prefer any kind of fishing to any kind of work the 
78yearold zern likes to say 
and 
fishermen are born honest but they get over it 
some wise guy once defined a fishing line as a piece of 
string with a worm on one end and a damn fool on the other this is 
a silly definition of course for many fishermen use flies instead 
of worms 
fish is brain food people who eat fish have large 
welldeveloped brains people with large welldeveloped brains 
dont fish its that simple 
beneath the mischievous grin however is a serious concern 
about what could lie ahead unless americans start paying more 
attention to the world around them 
thirtyfive years ago we didnt have waste products of 
nuclear plants zern says we didnt have a lot of the poisons 
that are poisoning the atmosphere we didnt know that spray cans 
could destroy our ozone layer 
zern never imagined things would become as bad as they have 
i thought something would be done about it measures would be 
taken he says unfortunately it didnt work out that way 
the bearded hoaryheaded author of the exit laughing column 
in field amp stream magazine occasionally mistaken in the past for 
another avid outdoorsman the late ernest hemingway is doing what 
he can to increase public awareness 
zern is the author of six volumes of humor and a 1985 anthology 
entitled hunting and fishing from a to zern he also is creator 
of the moreorless imaginary madison avenue rod gun bloody mary 
and labrador retriever benevolent association whose motto is 
keep your powder your trout flies and your martinis dry 
its implicit in everything he does the respect for the 
outdoors the love for it says maggie nichols field amp streams 
managing editor 
that zeal is perhaps best exemplified in the conservation awards 
program zern founded in 1954 with corporate backing his aim was 
and still is to give conservationconscious folks a slap on the 
back 
his chevron conservation awards program believed to be the 
oldest privately supported program of its kind in the country has 
recognized 663 individuals and 101 organizations over the years 
the 1989 finalists were honored may 17 in washington dc 
each year zern helps whittle down the list of up to 150 
nominees some of them he acknowledges fit the stereotypical 
image of the conservationist 
little old lady in tennis shoes they exist and theyre 
charming people usually he says chuckling 
his alltime favorite finalist is a 70yearold pennsylvania 
game warden who was honored in the late 50s the mans wife who 
nominated her husband for the award thanked zern profusely 
following the ceremony 
this little old lady came up to me and said mr zern i want 
to thank you for being involved in this and to tell you what a 
wonderful thing it was for me zern says i said well i 
should think it would be wonderful to have all these people here to 
honor your husband 
she looked sort of surprised she said oh no it isnt 
that weve been married 52 years and this is the first time weve 
ever stayed at a hotel 
zerns passion for the outdoors was nurtured by his father who 
headed west virginia universitys department of mines during the 
1910s the elder zern often took his young son on inspection trips 
i would see what the mine drainage had done to the stream 
he recalls 
zern caught his first trout at age 5 the next year his family 
moved from west virginia to the pittsburgh area 
since then zern has fished and hunted on five continents 
occasionally sometimes by accident and sometimes not zern 
repeats himself in his exit laughing column which he began in 
1958 it never goes unnoticed 
i always get three or four letters and i hae the same answer 
to all of them he says 
i say dear mr thompson thank you for your letter of such 
and such a date the last time i heard the philadelphia orchestra 
they played the brahms first and i understand theyve done it 
several times before sincerely yours 
so just where does he get his ideas 
i wish i had one he says ive got a piece due the day 
after tomorrow it was a lot easier when i was younger and 
smartaleckier than i am now 
he also suffers now from parkinsons disease which causes his 
hands to tremble and consequently prevents him from shifting from a 
manual typewriter to an electric typewriter or computer 
nevertheless zern is at his home in scarsdale ny only about 
half the time the rest of the time hes on the road 
his favorite sport and writing topic is fishing like many 
serious anglers he tosses his catch back into the water 
zern doesnt feel the least bit sorry for the uninitiated 
im rather glad everybody doesnt like fishing or the good 
fishing places would be so overpopulated he says so id never 
knowingly write anything that would encourage anybody to go 
fishing you can always build more bowling alleys or tennis courts 
you cant build more trout streams 
his sentiments are shared by his programs awardees 
among the 11 citizen volunteers honored this year were a juneau 
alaska couple who have developed a school curriculum on marine and 
wetlands resources and a milwaukee man who has led a campaign to 
establish a national park in american samoa 
ten professional conservationists also received 1000 and a 
bronze plaque including a us fish and wildlife service biologist 
from massachusetts who is working to save the threatened piping 
plover a shore bird 
the five group finalists included the united anglers of casa 
grande high school in petaluma calif which is rehabilitating 
local waterways so fish can migrate upstream the 30 to 40 students 
are raising money for a new hatchery to replace one that failed to 
meet earthquake standards 
zern says he has no real way of knowing whether the awards 
program or any of his other efforts have had or will have a 
significant effect 
we dont really know how many souls are saved he says no 
matter how tough the sermon

editors note one of the managers of a connecticut bar 
himself a recovering alcoholic decided adults needed a place to go 
to dance and party without being exposed to booze like the 
nonalcoholic clubs for teenagers so one night a week the night 
life vip lounge becomes club soda where the drinks are no stronger 
than the name implies 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the dance music pulses through the art 
deco nightclub with its mirrored walls as bartenders hurriedly 
stir shake and blend exotic drinks 
the adult crowd at club soda is partying this friday night but 
they are all sober there is no alcohol in the drinks 
its a major nightclub it has everything but the booze 
says joseph w perugini one of the managers of club soda a friday 
night nonalcoholic alternative for adults who want to party 
without getting drunk 
there are people out there that just cant drink and they have 
no where to go 
there are many nightclubs offering dancing and a club ambiance 
without alcohol for teenagers but a boozeless bar for adults is 
unusual says peruginis partner thomas rowlay 
we could pack them in with kids but at the same time thats 
not what we were looking for rowlay says 
except for friday nights club soda is actually the night life 
vip lounge a fullservice bar and the decision to ban booze each 
friday night typically a busy night for bars was something 
personal for perugini a recovering alcoholic 
im recovering and ive met through my past two years out 
there a different breed of people that enjoy life without the 
sauce perugini says 
im just tired of reading just say no to drugs and say no to 
booze youve got to do something anybody can say that its time 
we show people how to live i feel real good about it 
perugini credits night life owners pat scarpa and dave destazio 
his employers for a number of years with giving him the chance to 
try the nobooze bar 
its an idea that night life beverage manager lester j szmajlo 
endorses 
youve got people that maybe shouldnt be drinking that dont 
want to drink and are off the sauce who want to come out and have 
that same atmosphere a party night and not get drunk szmajlo 
says 
does the lack of alcohol mean a dull crowd not according to 
club sodas two managers 
its like is there life without drinking yeah there sure 
is rowlay says the important thing is people who dont drink 
are no different from people that do i mean in terms of dullness 
because you have some people who dont drink who are dull and you 
have some people who do drink who are dull 
the club soda drink menu runs the gamut from the everpopular 
shirley temple ginger ale with a dash of grenadine to more exotic 
items such as the lemon spritzer pineburst and a host of frozen 
coladas as well a mineral water cappucino and expresso coffees 
joe mrozinski head bartender at club soda says the fancy 
drinks at 350 a pop are big sellers theres not much call 
for nonalcoholic beer so we discontinued it he said 
the help has been very supportive of this and its tough to 
find bartenders that will work without getting the tips that 
theyre accustomed to in a real bar perugini says 
the club which opened feb 27 averages 130 to 150 people a 
night perugini says most nondrinkers are discovering the club by 
wordofmouth although the club purchased a few ads in the local 
newspaper 
michelle killiany 19 of bristol heard about the club in an 
alcoholism recovery program in which she participates 
i dont miss not having drinks not at all she says i 
like it here a lot the mirrors and the nonalcoholic drink hang 
around youll see its a gas its worth the drive 
donald corriveau 29 of new britain is becoming a regular 
theres not too many places you can dance without alcohol 
being around and we just started to avoid those places he says 
were recovering from that alcohol experience and being around 
those kinds of bars is not good 
there is a doorman at club soda not to check ids but to check 
for boozers and potential troublemakers the doorman does not admit 
anyone who has been drinking 
some people may come in for a goof but thats on them 
perugini says theyre the ones who paid the five bucks to come 
in and walk right out

editors note its something of a cross between ripleys 
believe it or not and 60 minutes which may have inspired its 
name soviet televisions rapidfire news show 600 seconds 
which unabashedly seeks out the sensational and often tweaks the 
establishment has become immensely popular since it went on the 
air before mikhail gorbachev came to power such a program would 
have been unthinkable in the soviet union 
</TEXT>

a lost bull roams a busy city street 
prostitutes woo foreign customers a holiday bombing rips off a 
mans legs 
these and other eyeopening images are flashing across soviet 
television screens as glasnost president mikhail s gorbachevs 
drive for openness goes video 
traditionally the kremlin has used staterun television as it 
did other media to reach the masses with propaganda rather than 
programs about things that directly affect their lives or were just 
plain fun the airwaves are still full of dull documentaries on 
subjects such as the grain harvest the leadership still commands 
unlimited time and news shows spend a lot of time reporting lists 
of government leaders seeing each other off on trips 
but gorbachev is a more lively tv personality than his 
predecessors and frequently turns to television to make speeches 
and broadcast his streetside talks with people for the first time 
this winter parliamentary candidates debated each other on 
television 
western music videos are shown routinely space bridges 
bring the uncensored views of western studio audiences into soviet 
living rooms and an occasional foreign commercial or film gives 
soviets a glimpse of western lifestyles 
one trailblazing program which featured the offbeat stories 
about the bull the prostitutes and the bombing is 600 
seconds a fastpaced live show on leningrad television that has 
become a smash hit since its premiere in december 1987 
one avid fan of 30yearold anchorman alexander nezorov said the 
program shows the soviet people what they were torn away from all 
their lives things that we learned to close our eyes to 
six days a week 15 million people in leningrad moscow and 
other regions can switch on their tv sets to catch up on the latest 
sensations from the soviet unions secondlargest city 
600 seconds the news magazine show fifth wheel the 
debate program public opinion and the music discussion program 
musical boxing ring make leningrad television among the most 
progressive in the soviet union reinforcing the reputation of the 
city built by peter the great as a window on the west 
600 seconds is like a cross between ripleys believe it or 
not and 60 minutes leningraders have nicknamed the show 
our city scandalmonger 
at 10 pm a rock music introduction is followed by 10 minutes 
of news reports read live by a studio announcer and videotaped 
reports presented rapidfire in a downtoearth style a digital 
clock flashes periodically onto the screen to tick down the 
remaining seconds 
everything about the show sets it apart from ordinary 
broadcasts which are presented in formal language in detail and 
are visually dull 
the shows popularity is evident to the staff about 200 calls 
and dozens of letters a day pour into the tiny dingy room in 
leningrads tv center where two harried producers and nevzorov work 
under a crumbling portrait of lenin ironically no portrait of 
gorbachev whose glasnost policy made the program possible hangs 
on the wall 
nevzorovs irreverence surfaces in every broadcast he relishes 
stirring up the town with what he calls sensations the program 
consists largely of crime reports but also has a heavy dose of the 
bizarre such as a story about the citys dirtiest toilet 
in a recent broadcast 600 seconds took on one of the citys 
biggest department stores accusing its employees of selling highly 
sought finnish clothing under the table the store demanded a 
retraction but nevzorov told viewers later that police had 
investigated and that no excuses can be made 
the program has stopped reporting about dogs says producer 
kirill m shishkin because the staff was swamped with calls for 
days by people offering to adopt a canine after one broadcast 
reported the dogs owner had been killed in a car accident 
nevzorov the shows cocreator and main anchor races around 
this city of 49 million people all day to gather material for his 
mondaythroughsaturday broadcast relying heavily on tips from the 
public and police 
he has become a celebrity without any of the perks that would go 
along with such status in the west no secretary no private 
office no chauffeurdriven limousine and a salary of only 475 a 
month 
adoring fans place flowers on his car and beg for autographs 
the soviet press has praised his pioneering style and colleagues 
say he has an uncanny sense of what will excite the public 
journalism students at moscow state university are studying his 
program as a model of how news should be reported on television 
but nevzorov rejects the label journalist he is a former horse 
trainer and tv scriptwriter and bristles when the word journalist 
is mentioned most soviet journalists he said could not come up 
with the stories he does and he doesnt agree with the western 
notion that journalists should be objective and not sensationalize 
the news 
he openly acknowledges that cooperatives the fledgling private 
businesses spawned by gorbachevs reforms are a target whenever 
we have the opportunity to nail them we do he says 
the public turns to 600 seconds to fight the soviet 
bureaucracy on one recent afternoon a caller asked the program to 
prod city authorities to clean up garbage piling up outside his 
apartment window 
600 seconds and other leningrad tv programs have helped lift 
the veil from subjects such as homelessness rape prostitution 
murder and robbery and taken aim at a particularly touchy subject 
privileges of the soviet elite one episode of fifth wheel for 
instance complained that elaborate government homes were being 
well maintained next to a childrens hospital that was a shambles 
but there are still forbidden themes nevzorovs boss alexander 
a yurkov said reports on unconstitutional or illegal events are 
barred unless they are accompanied by critical commentary 
edward a sagalayev head of soviet tvs information department 
who is fighting to reform soviet tv said reforms can be difficult 
i also have my bosses we have our minister he has his 
deputiesand it is not always possible to overcome 
psychologically these traditions

while much of soviet television is looking more 
western the man who reads the news to millions every night prefers 
to do things the oldfashioned way 
hello comrades igor kirillov says as he peers through 
thick bifocals to begin vremya the nightly news on 
statecontrolled television 
he has uttered those same words since vremya first went on the 
air on jan 1 1968 and became a main news source for the soviet 
unions 285 million people 
while other soviet tv programs and the press are tapping 
glasnost president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of openness to 
air sensations about crime history or life in the west vremya 
has remained almost as dull as it was 21 years ago 
when the superpowers agreed last march that us president 
ronald reagan would travel to the country he had called an evil 
empire a major announcement worldwide soviets had to sit 
through two hours of a gorbachev speech about farming and a story 
about domestic ethnic strife before learning the news from vremya 
which is russian for time 
vremya still dwells on longwinded reports about the soviet 
economy often featuring tractors plowing farm fields and therefore 
dubbed tractor news 
nd in static pictures that make western producers cringe 
cameras often fix on kirillov and other announcers reading lengthy 
government statements 
vremya has its high points however when an earthquake killed 
thousands on dec 7 in armenia vremya aired a dramatic report from 
the scene within hours and kept on top of the story for weeks 
kirillov 57 read the news during the period of stagnation 
the conservative rule of president leonid i brezhnev and has 
continued through the glasnost years 
interviewed in vremyas tiny studio kirillov compared the 
program then and now 
earlier it was good he said through gritted teeth 
indicating some discomfort with that evaluation switching to his 
full baritone voice he added now it is also good 
other tv programs borrow the style of american broadcasts 
kirillov concedes he watches the cable news network but says he is 
sticking to his oldfashioned formal style 
we like not to rush so it comes from the soul he says 
trained as an actor he believes anchormen should express their 
opinions through intonation and gestures 
but kirillov is part of a vanishing breed in five to 10 years 
he predicts multitalented professionals of a higher level 
intellectually will replace vremyas theatrically trained 
announcers 
a new man in charge of vremya described the ideal anchorman 
he should be a little bit of a journalist a little bit of an 
actor a little bit of a politician says edward m sagalayev 
head of soviet tvs information department 
producers are spicing up vremya with graphics foreign video 
plucked off communications satellites and shorter more 
interesting and timely reports 
sagalayev says vremya lags behind other programs because it was 
born before glasnost when there was a big difference between 
politics and real life and because it has much official and 
government information 
but he adds tractor news is really a tradition that we must 
abandon for decades the impression was formed that economic 
information must occupy the top place 
pressure for change is coming from many directions the 
communist party newspaper pravda said in 1986 the program was dull 
and tv officials agree it still is 
it must be more dynamic more informative more visual says 
alexander a yurkov a top official of leningrad television 
popular for its westernstyle programs 
sagalayev who gained a reputation as a reformer when he 
produced the live news and entertainment show vzglyad agrees and 
he hopes to make vremya more appealing 
news should be what interests millions of viewers and not a 
small group of people he says

dinah manoffs earlier work for the producers 
of empty nest almost prevented her from getting a role in the 
new nbc comedy 
the show about a recently widowed pediatrician who suddenly 
finds himself living alone was created by susan harris who also 
created soap and the golden girls 
manoff plays carol weston the selfabsorbed daughter of the 
pediatrician played by richard mulligan and sister of a 
policewoman played by kristy mcnichol 
they auditioned hundreds of actresses she says everybody 
i knew went in for that role they couldnt find what they were 
looking for 
it would seem that manoff would have had an edge because she had 
played elaine lefkowitz in soap for the producers 
wittthomasharris 
but she says they didnt think i was right for the part at 
first because of the work id done in soap the characters were 
different they didnt want the new york jewish fasttalking 
tough mafia princess i played in soap id played the same kind 
of character in the movie i ought to be in pictures 
so i asked to read when i read i made sure that none of that 
was showing and they saw it and cast me 
manoff says she has a real affinity for the writing of susan 
harris 
i understand her rhythm she says i understand her 
language 
manoff also claims an affinity with her character in empty 
nest 
carol in my mind is always on her way to therapy or coming 
from therapy she says shes usually in a selfabsorbed state 
of mind for me the character is rooted in pms premenstrual 
syndrome 
my favorite line is when kristy comes bounding down the stairs 
and says my greatest fear has happened im falling in love 
carol says my greatest fear is that there is no such thing as pms 
and this is who i really am every woman in the audience howled 
for 10 minutes thats who carol is and who i am on my worst days 
she disagrees with descriptions of carol as neurotic shes 
just terribly selfinvolved she says everything has to 
revolve around her if theres a disaster somewhere her only 
thought is how does it affect her she regularly takes her 
emotional temperature 
manoff grew up in a show business family her mother is 
actressdirector lee grant and her stepfather is producer joe 
feury last summer she worked in boys life a movie made on 
location in south carolina directed by her mother and produced by 
her stepfather 
it was very interesting she says it was kind of like 
being 14 and told to clean up your room thats the downside the 
upside is that she and i are very close friends and very admiring 
of each other as actresses and artists 
i know my work is safe with her because she will only let me 
do good work but when shes directing we have to go back to a 
childparent relationship it pushes all my buttons when she tells 
me how to fix my hair and how to dress i try not to call her mom 
on the set but when im tired and cranky it slips out 
shed worked for her mother once before on a tv movie called 
a matter of sex the movie which also starred jean stapleton 
was about sexual discrimination in the workplace 
she didnt begin acting until she was 19 because her mother 
didnt want her to be a child actor she was a college film student 
briefly then quit to pursue her acting career 
id like to direct someday she says but ill leave 
filmmaking for later in life acting is creative and a release from 
your emotions thats fun directing is more comfortable and puts 
you in charge as an actor you have to be open and vulnerable as 
director you get to be an adult doing a grownup job 
manoff studied at the actors studio and made her professional 
debut in a production for pbs called the great cherub knitwear 
strike next she did a small role on the tv series welcome 
back kotter 
manoff won a tony in 1980 for her broadway role in i ought to 
be in pictures she reprised her role in the movie version 
her only other series was soap on which she played the 
daughter of a gangster and the wife of danny dallas ted wass i 
was spoiled and mean a real pain she says then i turned 
nice it was the taming of the shrew or the jew i became sweet 
and loving and there was no place for my character to go so they 
killed me off 
her film childs play is just out and bloodhounds of 
broadway is due in september another movie a thriller called 
backfire is coming up on showtime 
she is starting a new movie called welcome home roxie 
carmichael which also stars winona ryder and jeff daniels

on one side of the stage stand the jets on the 
other side the sharks the rival gangs from west side story 
huddle around microphones and watch conductor paul gemignani on a 
small podium in the middle of a vast woodpaneled room filled with 
musicians 
its a sunday morning and the cast and orchestra of jerome 
robbins broadway are in rca records studio a on west 44th 
street 
the singers look at gemignani the conducter wearing 
headphones glances at a man standing over a control panel in a 
soundproof booth near the stage take after take is recorded until 
jay david saks is satisfied 
saks an rca records producer is the man who must capture the 
sound of jerome robbins broadway a celebration of some of the 
biggest musical hits by the famous director and choreographer 
besides a suite of dances from west side story the show 
includes numbers from fiddler on the roof the king and i 
gypsy peter pan and others 
the final result released in may on two records or two 
cassettes or two compact discs is one of the most lavish original 
cast recordings ever made it includes more than 120 minutes of 
music and a 62page booklet with extensive notes on each of the 
musicals included in the show 
cast albums are very demanding says saks who has been in 
the recording business since 1972 when he was hired by cast album 
guru thomas z shepard at columbia records they require a great 
deal of advance preparation and a lot of study if youre going to 
record the beethoven seventh symphony you dont have to sit 
there in advance and decide whether youre going to take it up a 
key or whether youre going to leave out the third movement 
but in the case of a broadway show you have a theatrical work 
thats designed for the stage and how does it translate to a 
record when you have nothing to go by except what youre hearing 
he says frequently you have to change the reality of what is 
happening musically to recreate more accurately the memory in the 
listener 
before the taping sessions saks wasnt sure how jerome 
robbins broadway would work on record it presented special 
problems 
most of this music is familiar and most of it has been 
recorded before he recalls for example you dont want to 
have just another recording of west side story plus theres a 
lot of dance music and music with no vocals in the show so what do 
you do with it 
saks decided to record not just the music but the feel of the 
stage production he brought in the cast to tape a lot of what he 
calls crowd material not just the singing in the case of the 
west side story segment that meant having 30 or 40 or 50 
people up on stage making fight or dance hall sounds for the 
mambo number or the fight sequence 
i think without that we would have ended up with another 
small orchestra recording of music from west side story he 
says we wanted to make it feel like you were in the theater 
many of the composers and lyricists represented in jerome 
robbins broadway including stephen sondheim morton gould jule 
styne jerry bock and sheldon harnick came to the february 
recording sessions after having preproduction conferences with 
saks 
in the past most broadway musicals were recorded in one day 
usually the companys day off some still are but jerome 
robbins broadway took three days spread over two weeks to 
complete 
for one reason it was twice as long as a regular cast 
recording it has a large cast 62 performers and a large 
orchestra 42 musicians plus two players added for the fiddler 
on the roof segment 
for another technical advances have allowed for more material 
to be placed on a record tape or compact disc 
in the old days there was a limitation as to how much music 
you could put on a record without having the recording suffer 
technically saks says if there were 60 minutes worth of 
recordable music in a show producers had to make some hard 
decisions as what to keep and what not to keep because they 
couldnt get more than 22 or 24 minutes on a side 
today compact discs can handle up to 74 or 75 minutes of 
material without much difficulty more of a show can be put on a 
single cd than could ever fit on a record 
now we say that anything worth recording we do record 
saks says 
saks jumped to rca in 1974 when shepard did he also became a 
producer of classical recordings supervising albums by such 
orchestras as the chicago symphony conducted by james levine and 
the philadelphia orchestra conducted by eugene ormandy but he also 
assisted shepard on some of the best cast recordings ever made 
including sunday in the park with george and sweeney todd 
his first solo cast recording as a producer was starting here 
starting now a tiny offbroadway musical revue by david shire 
and richard maltby jr when shepard left rca in 1986 saks took 
over its broadway cast album production in the last two years he 
has done anything goes legs diamond and into the 
woods for which he won a grammy 
and rca has dominated the cast album market since also 
recording such broadway shows as chess and sarafina during 
the same time period saks didnt do those recordings they were 
produced by their own composers 
im a strong believer in not doing what you dont think you 
can do well he says

christianity islam and judaism sprung from one

millions of christians in the middle east 
and north africa faced with moslem and jewish fundamentalism feel 
they are treading the narrow lip of a volcano 
many believe they have no future in this area said gabriel 
habib generalsecretary of the cyprusbased middle east council of 
churches 
you have a climate of despair and hopelessness christians 
fear the future 
an estimated 12 million to 14 million christians live in the 
region gathered in minority pockets among 120 million moslems and 
4 million jews 
as christians the biggest challenge we face is the rising 
militant fundamentalism of islam and the militant fundamentalism of 
judaism of israel said dr george sabra assistant professor of 
theology at the near east school of theology in west beirut 
moslem persecution of the followers of jesus dates from the 
crusades when they were viewed as fifth columnists for the 
invading europeans who came to recover the holy land 
that suspicion lingers 
fundamentalists ought to understand that pluralism in the arab 
world is a necessity of life said bishop eliya khoury head of 
the anglican church in jordan if not believe me extremism 
breeds only opposite extremism 
in lebanon maronite catholics see their fight in a 14yearold 
civil war as another chapter in a centuriesold struggle for 
survival against islam 
the maronites the only christians to have held political power 
in the modern arab world claim that lebanons shiite moslems want 
to create an islamic state modeled on iran 
their fight to hold onto their traditional privileges is the 
taproot of lebanons civil war 
theyre the only christian community with a distinct political 
history said professor kamal salibi who teaches history at the 
american university of beirut 
they fear being overwhelmed if the system is democratized 
they would be outvoted and they cant carry the day 
maronite extremism is the starkest christian reaction to the 
growth of both islamic and jewish fundamentalism in the middle east 
christians increasingly believe that if they do not assert their 
own beliefs they might be subsumed by fundamentalist zeal 
in addition to sharing with everyone else the wars the 
economic problems the great power challenges christians are 
caught between israel on the one hand and islam on the other the 
council of churches habib said 
but their leaders fear that an aggressive response could trigger 
their own destruction the tension pushes thousands to emigrate 
the maronites once slightly more than 50 percent of lebanons 
population have dwindled to about 30 percent 
christians who remain in the region worry about the loss of 
their special identity 
mary saliba a christian mother living in predominately moslem 
west beirut says she sends her four children as often as she can 
to the christian sector 
i dont want them to end up marrying moslems she said 
moslems see the maronites as warring to keep their lockhold on 
the lebanons presidency and other centers of power reserved for 
them since independence from france in 1943 
under israels laws all citizens are guaranteed equal civil 
rights but its creation as a state for jews effectively 
marginalized christians christian leaders say 
the political factor is heightened because most christians in 
the holy land are palestinians who fundamentalist jewish groups 
seek to expel from the jordan rivers west bank taken by israel 
since the 1967 war 
in the islamic belief christians and jews are considered 
harbingers of the true faith and are protected as fellow believers 
in the old testament 
but there is a deep fear of fundamentalists overthrowing 
existing regimes and establishing societies based on sharia 
islamic law said habib 
these laws include banning pork veiling women cutting off the 
hands of convicted thieves and stoning adulteresses 
only about 180000 christians mostly armenians remain in iran 
tens of thousands left after the 1979 islamic revolution instituted 
sharia 
you cant study armenian or the bible there said joseph a 
15yearold whose family moved to cyprus so he could enroll in the 
armenian school 
there are lots of extra lessons arabic the koran persian 
which i wont need in the future he said 
sudan is locked in a civil war because christians in its south 
loath the islamic rules voted in by the northern moslems 
moslem clerics call such fears baseless

sheik mohammad hussein fadlallah spiritual guide of lebanons 
shiite fundamentalists said christians should be guided by the 
biblical verse render unto caesar what is caesars and unto god 
what is gods 
theres no conflict between christianity and islam when islam 
demands the implementation of sharia he added whats the 
difference between implementing the islamic order in a christian 
area and implementing the marxist or the french or any other system 
in a christian area 
the problem christians say is that a religious state would 
intervene they noted for example that fundamentalist moslem 
militias forced the american university of beirut to alter its 
courses of study 
the koran islams holy book was dropped from a cultural 
studies course after the fundamentalists objected its use as one 
text among many they also objected to christians teaching about 
islam 
in egypt the moslemchristian strain starts with the census 
militant christian copts claim they number 12 million the 
government sets the number at 3 million the true figure is 
believed to be around 7 million 
egypts islamic fundamentalist underground occasionally vents 
its anger on the copts who trace their beginnings to st paul in 
the year 50 
the moslem militants who assassinated president anwar sadat in 
1981 were accused of robbing rich coptic jewellers for funds 
violence erupted in the egyptian fundamentalist strongholds of 
minya and assiut in 1987 after the fundamentalists accused copts of 
spraying crosses on moslems clothing 
copts do attain influential positions in egypts government the 
minister of state for foreign affairs butros ghali and the 
ministers of emigration and international cooperation are copts 
their coreligionists have reached high posts in the judiciary 
and the army but none has ever been defense minister or 
commanderinchief 
they also face some legal restrictions for example a coptic 
man can marry a moslem woman only if he converts to islam 
copts always have to do things by the back door said one 
man who produces and distributes biblestudy videos 
copts feel a certain insecurity said an egyptian who would 
identify himself only by his first name henein they dont have 
easy access to superior positions 
the covert discrimination often tips the scales for christians 
deciding to emigrate 
turkey has a secular government but bans christians from 
government posts christians there said the historical animosity 
between the two communities has ebbed but many high school 
students emigrate leaving behind an increasingly elderly community 
fewer than 10000 christians remain in the old city of 
jerusalem according to church statistics some fear it might 
shrink to the point of virtual extinction 
christianity might be represented by monuments buildings and 
stones rather than by people said the most rev samir kafity 
anglican bishop of jerusalem and the middle east 
most western christians dont realize theres a living 
christian community in the middle east said ramy khoury a 
publisher and writer in amman jordan when they come here and 
see christians theyre slightly surprised 
in many arab countries christians try to keep a low profile to 
avoid trouble 
in egypt the head of the coptic church pope shenouda iii 
recently blocked an attempt to form a coptic political party 
those who want peace and national unity must mesh with their 
moslem brothers he said establishing a christian party will 
create negative reactions

moslems recognize jesus as a prophet but 
the crusades in the middle ages planted suspicions among them that 
christians were allied with those who wanted to subvert islam 
those suspicions are rekindled today by a new kind of crusader 
christian evangelists such as americans jerry falwell and pat 
robertson 
they preach that israel fulfills biblical prophecies predicting 
the arrival of a new messiah and seek to convert moslems 
the crusaders came out of the conviction that we were not 
christian enough said gabriel habib general secretary of the 
cyprusbased middle east council of churches 
crusader castles dot the modern states of syria lebanon israel 
and jordan symbols that christianity although born in the holy 
land was later a colonizer 
now the christian fundamentalists are projecting an image of 
christianity of political and economic power its the image of a 
new crusade this time allied with israel habib said 
the fundamentalist groups have opened the socalled 
international christian embassy in jerusalem where israel has its 
capital to spread their teachings 
a glossy tract published by a california church says jesus is 
coming to rule from jerusalem 
robertsons christian broadcasting network has a television 
station in an israeliheld sector of south lebanon it has been 
destroyed twice in bombing attacks 
the stations administrative manager who agreed to be 
interviewed only on condition of anonymity said robertsons 
support for israel is a personal statement and the station tries to 
avoid politics 
almost 70 percent of its programming ranges from us football 
to magnum pi he said 
but he noted that the rest are programs to inspire people in 
their faith proiranian moslem militants in lebanon would like 
to see these off the air he said 
evangelical groups say they work in the middle east because the 
regions christians isolated in minority pockets around the arab 
world are not forceful enough 
seeking converts is what the gospel calls them to do among 
their own people said a missionary with the assembly of god who 
did not want his name used because it might limit his ability to 
travel in the region 
i wish every coptic priest every roman catholic priest would 
do it he added

if theres a deep black hole in south america 
bolivia has been in it but now as some of its more advanced 
neighbors might be on the verge of falling in bolivia may be 
coming out the light at the top offers hope for the poorest 
country on the continent but its still only a glimmer this is one 
in a series of periodic reports by the associated press on the 
economic social and political turbulence that has turned south 
america into a continent in crisis 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a remarkable economic turnaround and a 
newfound political stability are giving hope to the south american 
country that perhaps most needs it 
but despite bolivias visions of a brighter future its present 
remains bleak 
of every 10 workers two cant find jobs and one has turned to 
the illegal cocaine business 
one of every 10 newborns doesnt survive infancy the worst 
rate in the americas 
of every 1000 bolivians 14 die each year thats nearly 
double the south american average 
the new leadership that will grapple with the countrys grave 
problems wont be known until at least aug 4 when congress 
convenes to choose a new president in a general election may 7 
all candidates fell short of the absolute majority needed for 
direct election so the legislature must pick from the top three 
finishers gonzalo sanchez de lozada the former dictator hugo 
banzer suarez and jaime paz zamora 
all three have pledged however to stick with an economic 
program that transformed bolivia from south americas most chaotic 
nation into what some are calling a third world model 
bolivia has had 76 governments since independence from spain in 
1825 half of them de facto military governments and the other 
half democratically elected 
from 1978 to 1982 its 69 million people many of them 
descendants of an indian culture that predated inca conquests in 
bolivia by several centuries saw eight changes of government 
they included three bloody military coups 
democracy was reestablished in 1982 but the government of 
thenpresident hernan siles zuazo proved unable to reverse an 
economic tailspin and an inflation rate that soared to an 
inconceivable rate of 23000 percent a year 
a 10million peso note shrank in value to 5 and the central 
bank confessed to not a penny in reserves 
when president victor paz estenssoro was elected to replace 
siles zuazo in 1985 he declared simply but dramatically bolivia 
is dying on us 
his government prescribed a drastic cure a 95percent currency 
devaluation an end to subsidized prices and a 10fold increase in 
the price of gasoline and the layoff of 35000 state tin miners 
and other government employees while public spending was slashed 
an effective new tax system brought in additional revenues 
the new program was put to an immediate test when world market 
prices for tin and oil the countrys main exports plunged 
drastically the plan nonetheless took hold 
inflation dropped and leveled off at about 10 percent a year 
among south americas lowest rates in 1987 and 1988 the country 
enjoyed modest but steady economic growth for the first time in 
many years 
oncescarce foreign investment is picking up as is foreign aid 
some factories and new homes and office buildings are going up 
with new tax revenues the government is paving streets and 
painting public buildings 
bolivia is a country that has made a complete turnaround 
us ambassador robert gelbard said in an interview it has 
reversed the trend toward economic collapse and established the 
base for recovery 
gelbard said he expects the recovery to continue no matter which 
of the three candidates is chosen president since each is 
committed to the program 
im very optimistic 
fernando mendoza world bank representative in bolivia said the 
bolivian program represents a very important example for latin 
america and other countries that are passing through a similar 
situation 
while such countries as nearby brazil and argentina try to 
entangle themselves from foreign debt bolivia because of its 
poverty is under less pressure from foreign creditors 
unlike other debtor countries bolivia owes most of its 
42billion foreign debt to governments or international 
assistance agencies which have been more willing to reschedule 
payment 
commercial lenders have virtually written off the 700 million 
bolivia owes them and has allowed the government to buy half of it 
back at 11 percent of its face value

<TEXT>
with economic stability has come political steadiness when paz 
estenssoro hands over power in august hell be the first elected 
president to finish out his full term in 25 years 
but the social cost of the program has been excruciating 
nevertheless and the benefits so far have not reached many of the 
jobless or the 2 million peasant farmers who know only of 
subsistence 
unemployment rose to a staggering 25 percent and still remains 
above 20 percent without government subsidies prices for many 
basic goods soared to levels similar to those of industrialized 
countries while wages remained at third world levels the minimum 
legal wage is equivalent to 150 a day 
in a wrenching upheaval thousands of exminers were forced to 
abandon the homes on the windy high plains among them were indians 
whose ancestors had lived there for millenia about 75 percent of 
bolivias people are of quechua or aymaya indian ancestry and about 
half the population lives in the countryside 
many moved into the swollen shantytowns on the fringes of la paz 
and other major cities others descended into the tropical lowlands 
and began growing coca the raw material for cocaine 
of a national work force of about 3 million an estimated 
300000 make their livelihood in some aspect of the cocaine 
industry growing processing or smuggling the business brings in 
200 million to 300 million a year equal to about half all legal 
export earnings 
indeed the drug profits helped cushion the impact of the 
government belttightening policies some say the country must now 
be gently weaned from the illicit activity 
a complete curtailment of cocaine without viable alternatives 
could be devastating to the national economy said a maryknoll 
priest patrick henry he works with addicted and abandoned 
children in the city of cochabamba the gateway to the countrys 
principal cocagrowing area the chapare 
the government as well as all three top presidential 
candidates oppose forced eradication of coca farms by burning or 
spraying with herbicides as is being tried in other south american 
countries 
instead they favor a usfinanced plan now in its third year 
to persuade coca farmers to switch to other crops and to leave the 
nowoverpopulated chapare 
but they also contend that the united states and other wealthy 
cocaineimporting countries must put up more money for the program 
some 300 million to 500 million over a threeyear period 
the big problem is getting the developed world to cooperate 
said sanchez de lozada the presidential candidate of paz 
estenssoros conservative revolutionary nationalist movement 
they seem to prefer to have somebody they can blame the drug 
problem on rather than finding a solution 
if you give us the resources we have the will he added in 
a conversation with foreign reporters 
the united states spends about 55 million a year on drug 
interdiction and cropswitching programs in bolivia it provides 
more than 100 million a year in aid to bolivia 
in all foreign aid from the industrialized world and 
international lending agencies is expected to total 365 million in 
loans and donations this year government officials recognize that 
the assistance is vital to health programs and development projects 
aimed at bettering life in south americas poorest country 
authorities agree that the countrys most desperate need is more 
and betterpaying jobs they expect that to result from the 
economic growth the country now is enjoying but acknowledge that 
the process is a gradual one 
among the new private investors are several foreign mining and 
petroluem companies but the country sees a need to reduce its 
heavy reliance on mineral production by promoting nontraditional 
exports such as soya lumber fruit flowers and alpaca wool 
in 1992 a natural gas sales contract with argentina that 
provides more than half of the countrys export earnings will 
expire bolivia has begun negotiating with another neighbor 
brazil to sell them gas but the arrangements will take several 
more years

here are some facts and figures on bolivia 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the land bolivia is landlocked in the heart of south america 
and is roughly the size of texas and arkansas combined it is is 
divided into three distinct geographical regions the highlands 
the mountainous valley regions and subtropical lowlands major 
cities such as la paz oruro and potosi are part of the andes 
mountain range the lowlands include the vast savannas and 
impenetrable jungles of the beni pando and santa cruz departments 
which are traversed by thousands of miles of rivers that feed into 
the amazon 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the people bolivias 69 population is largely made up of 
people of quechua and aymara indian origin although spanish is the 
official language quechua and aymara are widely spoken in rural 
areas and in major cities in the tropical regions guarani and 
other native languages are also spoken the population is largely 
roman catholic although indian farmers maintain a mixture of 
catholic and indian beliefs that include worship of a goddess of 
the earth the last two decades have seen a significant migration 
of quechua and aymara farmers to the lowland regions including 
areas that produce sugar cane coffee and coca leaf which is 
processed into cocaine 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the history aymara and other indian cultures which predate by 
several centuries the inca conquest of bolivia established an 
elaborate system of government and built the city of tiwanacu with 
its vast irrigated fields and elaborate stone and ceramic figures 
the incas conquered the highlands and some of the lowland regions 
of bolivia in the 13th century the spanish conquerors took over in 
1538 bolivia which is named after its liberator simon bolivar 
became independent from spain in 1825 and separated itself from 
peru in a series of wars over the next century bolivia lost its 
pacific coast to chile part of its amazon to brazil and some of 
its southern territory to paraguay 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the economy bolivia has a free market economy that has begun 
to see stability in 1985 tough austerity measures were used to 
control hyperinflation which had soared to 23000 percent 
inflation has plunged to 15 percent and the government estimates 
that the economy will grow by 35 percent in 1989 bolivia seeks 
foreign investors interested in mining petroleum exploration and 
agriculture bolivia is still heavily dependent however on 
cocaine trafficking which brings in an estimated 200 million to 
300 million a year and provides a livelihood to 300000 bolivians 
natural gas which earned 214 million in exports last year has 
supplanted minerals as the main source of export earnings which 
totalled 6005 million in 1988 mineral exports amounted to 196 
million in 1988 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the culture bolivia has a rich and dynamic culture rooted in 
its indian heritage aymara and quechua indians make exquisite 
weavings and outfits and have elaborate rituals and festivals that 
date to precolombian times the rich cultural diversity is 
manifest during carnival in the mining city of oruro and gran poder 
in la paz when thousands of dancers wearing elaborate masks and 
outfits pay homage to patron saints bolivia also has a rich 
musical and visual arts tradition

heinzpeter distel leathery 
hands gripping an iron shipwheel guides his 1200ton livein 
barge downriver in a family tradition nearly as old as the medieval 
castles looming on both sides of the mighty rhine river 
i was born on the water and i dont really have any desire to 
leave it this is in my blood says distel part of a breed of 
fiercely independent west germans who work and live on familyowned 
transport barges 
distel and his wife helga are the sole owners operators and 
residents of the stadt monheim a workhorse barge thats nearly the 
length of a football field and has most of the comforts of a 
conventional home 
the 52yearold distel is a man of few words 
ensconsed high up in the pilot house next to his multiband 
radio he keeps his vision firmly fixed on the fastrunning river 
and steers a steady course through central west germany 
twin diesel engines throb powerfully below propelling the 
vessel at a good clip past famous old castles like the picturesque 
marksburg near koblenz 
the drachenfels a mountain where the legendary germanic hero 
siegfried slew a dragon appears in the distance as the stadt 
monheim glides north 
helga distels 47yearold wife and sole crewmember carries a 
tray with vegetable soup wurst and pudding up the outside iron 
staircase to her husband from their living quarters on the rear 
deck 
she ducks quickly into the pilot house helped out by a strong 
rhine wind blowing across the port side 
another barge comes into view on the starboard side and mrs 
distel waves enthusiastically to the people on board 
we know them and a lot of other people who work on the 
river she said sometimes well put into port with friends and 
have a little party but it could be a month or more before were 
ever with them again 
its just another work day for the distels who consented to 
take an associated press reporter on board for the day on the 
stretch in central west germany 
the distels are still enraptured by the rhine rivers landscape 
even though it is a normal part of their daily lives 
but this is clearly not the life for anyone 
it is not what most people would call an easy life were 
under way 14 hours a day sometimes 10 days straight and were 
never sure when we might be able to take a day off said mrs 
distel 
but the distels say as long as theyre willing to work long 
hours they can make a pretty good living 
and its not every family that has the chance to cut across the 
heart of europe week after week visiting historic cities like 
basel mainz and heidelberg and crossing into france belgium and 
the netherlands as well 
i really enjoy doing this and i wouldnt trade it for 
anything else in the world said mrs distel who paints rhine 
landscape pictures when shes not busy with chores 
fewer and fewer families are able to afford running a barge 
business because of skyrocketing costs and stiff competition from 
powerful shipping companies and the railroad 
some 2000 familyowned livein barges were registered in west 
germany in 1980 but the figure has dropped to about 1300 
distel is a member of one of the most venerable west german 
families still operating barges tracing his forebearers 
riverworking roots back to the 16th century 
distel was born on a barge and spent most of his life on river 
boats owned by his grandfather and father 
i went to a special boarding school for kids in shipping 
families until i was 17 distel said while on the threeday run 
from ludwigshafen in west germany to antwerp in belgium with a load 
of liquid fertilizer 
the distels 19yearold daughter who has chosen a career in 
marketing and lives on land also attended such a school 
during his own school years distel would join his family on 
their boat during holidays and vacation time 
ive never felt at home on land so when i finished school i 
came to my real home the rhine distel said 
distel does a lot of the strenuous mechanical work on his 
40yearold stadt monheim named after a rhine river town near 
cologne and he oversaw the mammoth job a few years ago of 
replacing the original engines for smaller but more efficient ones 
like other barge families the distels own a thoroughly 
modernized vessel loaded with domestic conveniences they even have 
a car strapped onto the deck for use when they go into port 
their living quarters consist of a carpeted living room a 
complete kitchen a bathroom with a shower and washing machine and 
a large bedroom 
book cases line the walls of the living room where there is a 
sofa and easy chairs a caged parakeet they call peterle and a 
color television set 
most of the distels travels are on the rhine but their 
contracts with various companies take them up and down other rivers 
as well such as the neckar and mosel they reach antwerp and other 
places via a web of canals leading off the rhine 
living on the river also has its dangerous side and families 
can face financial ruin from running aground and other accidents 
but mrs distel says theyve been fortunate and attributes that 
to her husbands navigational skill and understanding of the river 
i could never work for anyone else because you lose your 
independence distel said id much rather be my own man and i 
know where i belong on the river

editors note fifty years ago on june 6 a group of 
neighborhood kids played an organized game of baseball on a 
scaleddown field in williamsport pa they called it the little 
league today more than 25 million young boys and girls play on 
140000 little league baseball teams in the united states and 33 
foreign countries but despite its immense popularity the 
organizer of that first game is not happy about the way the little 
league turned out 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
when you drive south on route 15 in 
northcentral pennsylvania just as you top the crest of bald eagle 
mountain pull over and cast your gaze to the valley below 
if there could be an ideal spot for the birthplace of little 
league baseball you are looking at it 
the susquehanna river its very name a poem winds down from the 
green allegheny hills through a town of 40000 souls who live in 
clapboard houses with porch swings and shade trees a timeless 
scene off a postcard labeled america 
move closer an american flag large enough to cover a small 
infield draws your eye to the north bank of the river it flies 
proudly in front of a 45acre complex of buildings and ball fields 
the international headquarters of little league inc 
little league baseball celebrates its 50th anniversary this 
year boys who played in the first little league game on june 6 
1939 have grandchildren playing in the league today 
still a halfcentury seems a relatively brief span for any 
activity however appealing to attain such astonishing growth and 
earn such a solid place in the national culture a little league 
ballpark has become as common a sight as a church spire in cities 
villages and suburbs across the land 
a threeteam league of 30 williamsport boys in 1939 was the 
seedbed for what little league inc today calls the largest sports 
organization in the world today 25 million youths play on 
140000 teams in 6000 leagues in the united states and 33 foreign 
countries if all the little leaguers joined hands the line would 
stretch from the susquehanna to the rockies 
of course i had no idea what little league would become 
says carl stotz who founded the league while working as a clerk in 
a lumber yard all i envisioned at the time was a neighborhood 
program some of what it has become i am not in favor of 
at 79 stotz still lives in williamsport he is a man with an 
incredible memory and a compulsion to keep daily logs and save 
receipts 
it isnt that i enjoy saving things he once explained to 
his daughter who complained about the clutter its just that i 
cant bear to throw anything away 
he can show you for example that the total expenses for the 
first little league season came to 17463 that the collection 
taken up at the first game netted 142 that the first boysized 
catchers mask ordered from chicago and which he still has cost 
167 the first dozen balls 2 the first years deficit was 
3672 which stotz made up out of his own pocket as he did every 
year until 1943 when the league finally finished in the black 
now little league inc has assets of more than 10 million and 
a staff of 70 paid employees at its headquarters it charges each 
of those 140000 teams a charter fee of 14 each year and earns 
millions on endorsements of athletic equipment and royalties on the 
little league name which is copyrighted and the logo which stotz 
designed the business of little league is unquestionably big 
league 
stotzs memory of how it all began is vivid 
one august day in 1938 he was playing catch with his two 
nephews jimmy and harold gehron ages 6 and 8 in his back yard at 
1108 isabella st running backward he tripped over the jagged 
stumps of a cutdown lilac bush and bruised his ankle his left 
ankle 
i sat on the back steps there he recalls pointing 
rubbing my ankle 
i said to the boys how would you like to play on a regular 
team with uniforms a new ball for every game and bats you can 
really swing 
one of them said uncle tuck thats what they called me 
who would we play 
i decided on the spot it would have to be a league of teams 
stotz gathered up a group of neighborhood boys each evening and 
went to a flat field at memorial park where picknickers played 
softball 
i used folded newspapers for bases threw the ball to various 
positions and had the boys run the bases we tried different 
distances between the bases until i found what i thought would be 
right for them and paced it off it came close enough to 60 feet 
that i rounded it off to that 
through the winter stotz worked out the details rules age 
limits and the like which have remained essentially unchanged he 
called on 57 merchants before he found the first sponsor lycoming 
dairy 
the next spring little league was born 
when carl passed out the uniforms the day before the first 
game it was one of the proudest days of my life recalls bill 
bair 
it meant it was really going to happen some of the guys put 
them on right there on the field maurice reader wore his to bed 
that night 
bair who now lives in nearby montoursville hit 462 that year 
to become little leagues first batting champion 
when korea won the little league world series 1984 you can 
credit bill bair in part bair and other little league graduates in 
the armed services spread little league all across the far east 
bairs son craig now manages a little league team in thailand 
stotz recalls that late in june of the first year some fans 
berated the umpire until he walked off the field 
it was the first indication said stotz of the problems 
overzealous fans can cause 
frank rizzo began as a little league umpire in 1941 and at 78 
is still at it conducting the little leagues umpiring school in 
williamsport 
ive seen some ugly things when the parents get too excited 
he says the kids walk off the field arminarm but i know of 
mothers who wouldt speak to each other for a month 
it gets worse than that 
when an umpire named charles berryhill called a game in 
waynesburg pa on account of darkness an irate mother hit him 
over the head with an umbrella

wabbit twouble bugs bunny classics the best of bugs 
bunny and friends mgmua home video 
 
the fine print on the videocassette jacket of bugs bunny 
classics says pre50s cartoons to cartoon buffs that says 
it all these are the great ones the warner bros looney 
tunesmerrie melodies classics that will keep you in stitches with 
clever lines biting satire and unrivaled cartoon artwork 
like trix they are definitely not just for kids 
of the three collections top honors go to bugs bunny 
classics it includes racketeer rabbit which parodies movie 
tough guys edward g robinson and peter lorre hare trigger an 
early bugsyosemite sam duel is high on the hilarity list as is 
haredevil hare in which bugs defends the honor of earth 
against a little martian with hightop sneakers named commander x2 
the title the best of bugs bunny amp friends is a 
considerable exaggeration it includes the wonderful tweetie 
pie a 1947 incarnation of that notsoinnocent wittle bird 
but two of the seven cartoons contain racial stereotypes of an 
african hunter and american indian that were offensive then and 
remain so today 
as the name implies wabbit twouble is 54 minutes worth of 
bugs outwitting elmer fudd especially funny is the old gray 
hare in which an aging bugs dern this lumbago is still 
too much for hapless elmer 
but wabbit twouble also illustrates the builtin problem 
bugs creators had creating a comic foil smart enough to spar with 
the wascally wabbit over time elmer was just too stupid to remain 
interesting or funny others such as yosemite sam came along but 
in his recent autobiography voice impressionist mel blanc said 
yosemite was pretty tough on his vocal chords

memories of me cbsfox home video vhsbeta 8998 rated 
pg13 
 
memories of me is almost a completely forgettable movie 
until its final third when theres finally some action to the 
drama about a father and son trying to reconcile their years of 
estrangement 
memories is henry winklers first outing as a director and 
it shows in the movies pacing much of the beginning is plodding 
and selfconsciously slow poignant moments when young dr abbie 
polin billy crystal reflects on his callous father hang 
relentlessly on dead air 
crystal cowrote the film and created a girlfriend jobeth 
williams for himself whose role in the melodramacomedy is vague 
at times her only purpose seems to be to admire crystals rear end 
or his sexual prowess 
the plot finally gets going when crystal after suffering a mild 
heart attack treks from new york to los angeles to resolve the 
decades of paternal indifference once hes there abbie learns his 
dad abe the king of hollywood extras alan king has a terminal 
illness 
they try to win abe a speaking part in a movie and validate his 
oftrepeated claim i am an actor in the process abbie comes 
to love his curmudgeonly dad who returns the favor by softening 
enough to tell abbie he loves him too and that in his role as 
father he was simply miscast 
it gets a bit cornball after this but the ending is far more 
compelling than the beginning and worth slogging through the slow 
start

in a sentimental mood warner bros dr john 
 
those who remember dr john as the night tripper who brought 
a touch of bayou mysticism to the era of psychedelic rock will find 
it curious to think of him as a sentimental kind of guy nor would 
his usual concoctions of delta blues rock and honkytonk lead one 
to associate him with such tin pan alley standards as more than 
you know or accentuate the positive 
even more unexpected are the lush string and horn arrangements 
heard in the background of some of the nine tracks on this album of 
classic old songs 
but as an accomplished session player dr john aka mac 
rebennack is nothing if not versatile so when he turns his 
keyboard talent and his distinctive gravelly voice to sentimental 
ballads such as candy and my buddy he knows how to create 
the right mood 
yet its clear this is not the doctors specialty an inner 
sleeve note credits ray charles for inspiration the fact is ray 
does it better 
dr johns seenitallandthensome vocal style works much 
better on the bluesy black night and on makin whoopee the 
sassy duet with rickie lee jones that leads off the album teaming 
those two vocal stylists was the best idea behind this record and 
it would be great to hear more from them 
the other highlights are the instrumental title cut a duke 
ellington number and a rollicking rendition of cole porters 
love for sale both featuring dr johns piano playing his 
true forte

kings of boogie gnp crescendo savoy brown 
 
in an age of classic soft drinks and candy bars perhaps 
savoy brown after 22 albums can be excused for taking on the title 
kings of boogie but as a souvenir of the coronation this 
effort is pretty stale 
theres plenty of boogie music here but youve heard it all 
before on any given night there probably are hundreds of bands in 
bars across the country playing this type of music with more 
inventiveness and freshness than what is displayed on kings of 
boogie 
as always bandleader kim simmons is impeccable on guitar the 
rhythm section is solid and vocalist dave walker can growl with the 
best of them the trouble is the material its tired cliched and 
forgettable 
oh yeah the albums liner notes gushing about the bands 
integrity seem a little silly next to the thank you note to a 
certain athletic shoe maker and the insert hawking official savoy 
brown merchandise

a night to remember epic cyndi lauper 
 
that is cyndi laupers name on the new album a night to 
remember and yes it sure sounds like her but for all we know 
it could be paula abdul or jody watley or debbie gibson fill in 
your own choice 
once delightfully distinctive laupers taken a distressing step 
backward into the sea of wannabes with this record the need 
for hits has made her music generic 
the cyndi on the shes so unusual album was a joy to know 
she was a tough independent woman with a marvelous set of pipes 
not afraid as the song says to have fun not many artists have 
the guts to defend masturbation on their first album 
where did that cyndi go on the first three songs of this new 
record lauper defines herself through men theres the man she 
craves so much shell drive all night to sleep with him the man 
she craves so much she feels primitive urges the man she 
craves so much she cant bear to spend that first night without him 
the narrator could be anybody although lauper shares 
songwriting credit on seven of this records tunes all are written 
at least in part by professional song doctors people such as 
billy steinberg and tom kelly who are brought in for artists 
desperate for hits 
some of the songs are good these people didnt get their track 
record by chance i drove all night in particular builds 
nicely with fine singing by the deeper voiced lauper a night to 
remember is another catchy tune however both are weighted down 
by overly loud drumming and busy arrangements 
some songs are too gimmicky insecurious and like a cat 
are ideas that probably sounded more clever on paper 
none of the tunes though really sound like laupers 
remember this is an artist whose last single stiffed and her 
first starring role in a movie vibes was a disaster this 
record has the uncomfortable feel of an artist whos lost her 
confidence being directed by a record company concerned about a big 
investment

john clark gable son of the star 
hollywood called king has decided to follow in the profession of a 
father he never knew 
the 28yearold gable is costarring with james brolin and 
richard roundtree in the western bad jim produced by menahem 
golans new 21st century film corp 
the movie has been shooting in the desert plains and arroyos 
northwest of phoenix and so far young gable has drawn high marks 
from his costars and director clyde ware 
i think hes got a lot of his father in him ware said 
hes never really acted before hes never wanted to act before 
hes a race driver imagine carrying the load of being the kings 
son i think he carries it very well 
the resemblance is hard to fathom john clarks face is long and 
thin compared to his fathers squarejawed look and his hair is 
light brown while gables was dark their height is the same but 
the son is slender and wiry the greatest similarity is in the 
voices both crackle with nononsense authority 
one recent afternoon before shooting began gable sat down 
before a frontier saloon amid a clutter of ramshackle movie sets 
called cow town and submitted to a rare interview 
submitted is an apt word since gable does not easily reveal 
himself that is natural after a childhood in which his mother kay 
spreckels gable strove mightily to keep him out of public view 
i am a private person he admitted crediting a little 
help from my wife she is tracy yarro and they have a daughter 
kayley 3 and a son clark james 7 months but how is he going to 
cope with the publicity spotlight thats generated as a movie actor 
real simple he said just as if im a rolling billboard 
out there in the desert ill play it the same way its the same 
as in racing its all advertising and product he is sponsored 
by bf goodrich and american racing wheels in his racing career 
does he enjoy interviews 
a rare grin please dont put me on a spot like that yes and 
no it depends 
john clark gable was born in 1960 three months after his father 
died of a heart attack at the conclusion of the misfits the 
boy spent his first 13 years on the 22acre gable ranch in the 
middle of encino the property has since been subdivided into 
luxury estates and the gable house is now occupied by indicted 
junkbond king michael milken 
i went back there once and it made me sick he said i 
drove up the driveway to my old house and was so appalled at what 
had been done to it that i turned around and drove away 
kay gable protected her son from the press and other intruders 
sending him to private schools buckley in west los angeles and 
brooks prep in andover mass 
she didnt like the way people handled interviews and she 
wanted to protect me gable recalled she was afraid of 
possible kidnapping she always told me that my father told her 
one actor in the family is enough 
gable spent a year at aiglon college in villars switzerland 
then graduated from santa monica city college in 1983 his fields 
of study included art ceramics a lot of science art history 
nothing related to the entertainment business 
during his college years gable became engrossed in motor cross 
racing much to his mothers distress she died in 1983 he has 
jolted through the grueling baja california race for almost 24 
hours straight twice he has had serious accidents in races one 
required seven hours of surgery after four years of motor cross he 
switched to classa trucks 
whats so great about racing 
i just love it the excitement of it he said theres 
nothing like racing across the desert they used to cross the 
desert in covered wagons back in the 1800s were just modernday 
cowboys in fullsized pickups now its pretty much the same thing 
we just go a little faster and a little harder 
fear i have no fear i have more fear when i get on a horse 
two years ago friends saw him in television interviews about his 
racing and suggested john clark could make it as an actor he 
studied for two years in acting school a lot of improvisation 
a lot of classroom work a lot of work on my feet with other 
actors or solo pieces the basic things you learn in acting 
school 
ware submitted a script that gable didnt like then he was sold 
on bad jim now john clark would like to do more acting 
especially action and adventure films im not very much into 
romance or any of that 
john clark first became aware of his famed father at a home 
screening of gone with the wind 
i was 2 years old and i couldnt sit through the whole movie 
at that point in my life he recalled i was kind of 
rambunctious at that age 
on another occasion he threw a glass of punch at the screen when 
he saw his father kissing another woman 
i really didnt know my father he remarked i used to 
love to hear my mother tell stories about him i was very lucky 
that i was able to see my father on film what he looked like 
acting talking moving i didnt really know much about my dad 
except the stories ive heard 
gable hasnt seen his fathers 66 films but he hopes to see 
them all some day his favorites are the misfits san 
francisco test pilot his very favorite mogambo 
gone with the wind of course mutiny on the bounty 
and soldier of fortune 
he was asked for a capsule portrait of the man who was called 
king his reply 
he was a very rugged outgoing man he was very social and 
generous to people but he also had a very private life he loved 
hunting he loved fishing he loved fast cars he loved motorcycles 
and horses 
that might also sound like a picture of john clark gable 
uhhuh he admitted it might run in the blood

stage doors sometimes stick and smoke effects 
have gone up in flames costumes are homemade or handmedowns and 
actors race out the theaters back door through a parking lot and 
past derelicts on the street to make front stage entrances 
its all part of high opera in a distinctly lowbrow area called 
the bowery one of new york citys dingier spots 
with a 24hour car park on one side a transient hotel and 
punkrock club on the other the narrow fourstory amato opera 
theatre fills the bowery with strains of mozart and puccini 
this everymans opera company is the creation of tony amato who 
fell in love with opera as a youngster shortly after emigrating 
with his family from minori italy to the united states 
but the amato theaters unprepossessing style is no cover for 
amateurish ways since amato launched his opera theater 41 years 
ago 65 alumni have graduated to the metropolitan opera new york 
city opera and other companies in the united states 
he was a beacon for me there was a place i could go at a very 
young age and learn said neil shicoff a lead tenor at the met 
he went to amato when he was 19 after being rejected by the 
juilliard school after three years with the amato juilliard 
accepted him 
the learning techniques of how to act were really from tony 
the 39yearold shicoff recalled in a recent interview how to 
stand how to really look at another singer and how to not lose the 
audience when you do that or how not to sing directly to the side 
into the wings 
it was only when i sang on an international level that i 
realized how good tony was he really could take somebody from 
scratch and teach you stuff which a lot of directors cant do 
attracted by that reputation amatos amateur casts of hundreds 
trek over after office hours from throughout the city for a chance 
to learn operas heroic and obscure roles staging and later to 
perform fulllength operas before tiny audiences the converted 
storehouse seats about 100 folding chairs are set up for sellouts 
at the amato only the scenic designer and musicians are paid 
the amatos receive rent for the building an annual grant from the 
new york state council of the arts for 4000 ticket sales at 12 
each a handful of contract performances and contributions keep the 
shows running last years annual budget was the highest ever 
100000 the season usually includes five productions of about 10 
performances each 
people dont really do it for money said 24yearold mark 
freiman who made his debut in march as the lead in the marriage 
of figaro 
amato a short whirlwind of energy controls almost every aspect 
of his company he chooses the operas stages the productions 
directs the actors changes the scenery conducts the orchestra 
hes the master of ceremonies announcing winners of raffles for 
amato tshirts and videotaped operas during a performance of 
faust several years ago amato even put down the baton to 
extinguish a fire when a smoke effect went awry 
my theory is that to have good theater one man has to be in 
charge when you have a stage director a music director a scenic 
director and a costume director too much friction too much time 
wasted i experienced it many many years ago thats why i decided 
to do everything myself 
i used to be a singer i still sing once in a while in an 
emergency said the 68yearold amato who toured the united 
states with regional opera companies as a tenor 
opera in those days was very bad badly put together and i 
always realized the lack of good theater in it so when i had a 
chance to i started teaching to earn some extra income i realized 
how much i could give to it 
dubbed the twopenny opera in one newspaper account of the 
theaters history the amato seems to pride itself on making the 
most of less his wife sally helps wherever needed from sewing 
costumes to singing lastminute roles props are inventive dry 
oatmeal was used once for snow but discontinued when hordes of 
mice invaded sets are reused carefully patched up so age doesnt 
show 
the orchestra pit is literally that a cramped cellarlike area 
mostly under the stage with barely enough space for one upright 
piano and the usual accompaniment of 10 musicians the concession 
stand is a small table in the back of the room where amatos 
sisterinlaw sells coffee and homemade rum balls and cookies 
when scenes call for front stage entrances actors must race out 
the theaters back door through the parking lot past a varying 
assortment of vagrants alcoholics and drug addicts and in through 
the theaters front door 
amato moved his theater to the bowery 29 years ago instead of 
having dope addicts we had wine addicts amato said 
but theres been no trouble and sometimes he invites his 
neighbors of the street in for a show 
i say if you dress clean ill let you come in and they do 
youd be surprised the knowledge of opera some of them have its 
incredible he said 
the contrast between the art form and the neighborhood is often 
startling 
were always running around with our costumes on the bums 
they stare at you and sometimes they think they have had too much 
to drink freiman said usually when you wear your costume no 
one says anything because its new york 
but during one opera which required tie and tails several men 
asked freiman for money because they thought he was rich 
it was weird shicoff recalled i would sing a performance 
down there and i would feel on top of the world and you would walk 
outside and somebodys laying in the gutter its a very strange 
dichotomy of emotions 
despite its humble stature the amato sometimes attracts opera 
critics from such publications as the new york times and the new 
yorker especially when it puts on operas not often performed 
elsewhere the generally favorable reviews are plastered throughout 
the theater 
unlike some large opera companies which dazzle the spectator 
initially but then sputter the amato operas production pulls the 
listener in very gradually gaining momentum as it progresses 
wrote the times tim page in a review of offenbachs tales of 
hoffman in 1986 
amato used to have more grandiose aspirations than his spot on 
the bowery 
years ago i believe i had an ambition to get to the 
metropolitan he said but not for the past 20 years because i 
know i could do more here to help the young artists get ahead and 
learn the trade

reggae has had its ups and downs over the past 
decade but frederick toots hibbert just keeps playing 
hibbert who has been making music since the early 1960s before 
the word reggae ever hit american music stores is back with his 
first lp since 1981 toots in memphis a collection of soul 
standards 
his raspy voice capable of sweetness and toughness has been 
likened to the late otis redding one of souls greatest singers 
the reggae star covers a pair of obscure redding songs ive got 
dreams to remember and hard to handle he also sings the 
rhythm n blues hit knock on wood and al greens love and 
happiness 
i always listened to al green otis and michael jackson 
stevie wonder hibbert said we are related somewhat 
reggaes most famous rhythm section sly dunbar and robbie 
shakespeare plays on the record also featured are guitarist 
teenie hodges who helped write love and happiness and andrew 
love of the memphis horns 
many of souls greatest artists including redding wilson 
pickett and aretha franklin recorded in memphis the idea for 
making an album there often had been suggested to hibbert and the 
singer finally contacted island records president chris blackwell 
to express his interest 
im not just a reggae singer hibbert explained i can 
sing anything any song rewrite the song and make it into my 
style 
thanks to young artists such as ziggy marley and maxi priest 
reggae has enjoyed a resurgence over the past year inspiring those 
who long for a return to the musics heyday of the early 1970s 
few of the stars who first made reggae internationally popular 
are still around bob marley the musics most celebrated artist 
died of cancer in 1980 peter tosh marleys onetime bandmate and a 
major performer in his own right was murdered in 1987 jimmy 
cliff whose talents were featured in the popular reggae film 
the harder they come is no longer a commercial success 
in the early 60s hibbert formed a ska trio the vikings 
with raleigh gordon and jerry mathias they quickly became one of 
jamaicas most popular acts with prince buster producing and 
hibbert leading the way on a series of local hits pain in my 
belly little flea and dog war 
the group renamed itself the maytals in 1966 and won that years 
jamaican festival song competition with bam bam hibbert 
formed a permanent niche in reggae history by giving the music its 
name in a 1968 song do the reggay 
we were just playing around hibbert recalled we used to 
have slogans jokes sometimes wed say of a girl thats not 
looking so great shes like a streggae that word was there and 
one morning i said lets do the reggae i didnt think that the 
name would last 
under the production of leslie kong the maytals entered their 
peak of popularity with a string of songs that became reggae 
standards funky kingston 5446 thats my number and 
pressure drop a featured number in the harder they come 
but hibbert was anxious to experiment with other forms of music 
covering the rock n roll oldie louie louie and a 
surprisingly danceable version of john denvers take me home 
country roads hibbert was surprised himself when he learned who 
performed the original song 
when i listened to it first i thought it was ray charles and i 
always liked ray charles sound he said i have a 
countryandwestern voice very high pitched i can find that voice 
anytime 
many reggae stars have been outspoken politically bob marleys 
active support for jamaican prime minister michael manley led to an 
assasination attempt in 1976 
priest and burning spear have each recorded tributes to the 
late black nationalist leader marcus garvey ziggy marleys latest 
album has several political songs 
but hibbert who broke up with the maytals in the early 80s 
prefers to concentrate on personal matters i dont write about 
politics the singer noted i write about naturality about 
real things that happen to real people 
one of hibberts most popular songs is love is gonna to let me 
down a heartfelt ballad 
its about a girl and im giving encouragement he said 
it can mean anybody male or female everytime i see your face 
something moves in my heart i believe in love so even if love 
lets you down love also never dies 
he also differs from other reggae musicians by not being a 
member of the rastafarian religious sect reggae got soul is a 
better way of expressing hibberts philosophy 
i know its got soul and if you got talent and soul you can 
sing it he said everybodys got soul reggae music is the 
music that carries love and good principles with it

with 80 pages of his first novel completed 
alexander stuart received some tragic news his 3yearold son 
joe was dying of cancer 
feeling a huge rage at the injustice of it stuart divided 
time between the hospital and the typewriter throwing himself into 
his work 
the book he had started was hardly a sentimental love story 
stuart wanted to write about the troubles of a seemingly normal 
middleclass english family and decided to use the teenage sons 
discovery of an affair between his father and sister as the central 
plot 
stuart had originally conceived a lowkey approach but changed 
his mind after learning of his sons illness joe stuart died in 
january at age 5 
it actually proved to be the perfect vehicle in a way to 
release my feelings because it pushed me closer to the edge 
explained stuart whose book is called the war zone 1695 
doubleday 
i wanted to write a book which would explore incest without 
being too disturbing the more i researched the more i realized 
its a very destructive process i dont think anybody could come 
out of it without being damaged 
my sons illness allowed me do it head on to try and take it 
all the way i hope its dangerous but in a responsible way i hope 
it challenges what you think and feel but at the same time feels 
true 
stuarts wife was pregnant when the writer developed the idea 
for the war zone with stuart about to become a father he 
became curious about the relationships between parents and children 
i was very fascinated by friends and their fathers and 
friends and their daughters and what seemed to be an electric 
spark i would watch the daughters with their fathers flirting 
with them and their friends i wondered what it would be like to 
have a teenage daughter 
the books narrator tom is an alienated teenager enraged with 
his father and sister and cynical about the world in general the 
34yearold stuart drew on his own disenchantment 
i think it definitely comes out of something i felt at his age 
and now he certainly does experience disillusionment hes 
horrified by what his father is doing what interested me in toms 
character was that whole area of exclusion all of us feel excluded 
at some time 
stuart born in 1955 grew up in the english town of bexley 
kent his childhood had little of the trauma suffered by tom but 
stuart learned that several people from his supposedly quiet 
hometown eventually committed suicide 
i do feel disillusioned in a sense its very hard to maintain 
in life the excitement you had at 12 13 or 14 why cant it be as 
wonderful as it seems to promise at that age i suppose thats 
partly what the books about 
he did have a sister and remembered the shifting alliances when 
confronting their parents 
we used to side against them at times at other times you sort 
of chop each other to get out of something certainly as a kid all 
of us have played our father against our mother the author said 
it seems to me the passions within the family are 
extraordinary to start with the family is the environment in which 
you tend to develop your relationship skills if you like the book 
takes it one step further 
he insisted however that the family portrayed in the war 
zone was purely fictional 
both my parents read the book and are somewhat stunned by it 
but at least they dont recognize themselves in it obviously one 
is influenced by ones childhood but i did work hard in recreating 
something fictional from my own experiences and friends i had 
spoken to 
film not writing was stuarts first love the author wrote the 
screenplays for ordeal by innocence and nicholas roegs 
insignificance and sees similarities between the written word 
and moving pictures 
i was fascinated by visual language he said i dont see 
it as a division to me its all about using the language thats 
available the camera can be used emotionally like martin 
scorceses mean streets 
when i write i think in terms of the emotion id want if it 
were in a film and than translate and get it onto the page 
he was struggling financially while writing the war zone 
but was too distressed about his son to notice 
i had a huge overdraft a huge mortgage and was really kind of 
feeling worried financially stuart said but once he was ill 
the financial problems didnt matter they became completely 
irrelevant it doesnt mean anything like seeing your son dying 
from cancer

a country music song lyric 
shes had five marriages her daughter tina had meningitis as 
an infant shes had medical and painkillerdependency problems 
her house burned 256 hours of tapes for her autobiography burned 
in another fire and she filed for bankruptcy last fall 
a settlement was made in march the bankruptcy is withdrawn and 
shes able now to explain about protecting herself with chapter 11 
but wynette isnt trying to change her image as the country 
queen of hurt and lonely its often said i spoke for the wronged 
woman she says 
her current single thank the cowboy for the ride is 
cheerful she is healthy and has been happily married since 1978 
to george richey who manages her career they met 22 years ago 
when he was writing songs for her with record producer billy 
sherrill who gave her the stage name tammy to go with her middle 
name wynette she was born virginia wynette pugh 
i think thats one reason our marriage has been good and 
lasted wynette says we were buddies first we worked well 
together we could talk 
when richey and i got married billy sherrill said there 
will be no more sad songs written he was right 
but she can still sing sad songs i remember how i felt when i 
wrote the song or what was happening in my life when i first heard 
it and recorded it i couldnt get the feeling across to them the 
audience if i didnt go back and put myself in that position 
she and richey wrote only one song on her new album when a 
girl becomes a wife for her youngest daughter georgette who 
was married in march in red bay ala her older daughters are gwen 
jackie and tina who was married last year 
wynettes new album next to you her 51st for cbs does 
contain some heartbroken and wrongedwoman songs such as you 
left memories layin all over the place and liars roses 
a sad song makes you reflect back on something in your life 
that has happened you can feel part of that song she said 
she was interviewed while in new york for her first appearance 
at the bottom line wynette is on a national tour these days she 
tours 11 months a year in the united states and europe and takes 
off three weeks in december ive got a beautiful house in 
nashville and i live on a bus 
the blond singer seems to glow with health it feels good to 
feel good she said i havent had any problems since surgery 
2 years ago i had one operation and formed adhesions which 
caused the rest of the operations im one of those people who form 
scar tissue 
about filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection against 
creditors wynette said she and her husband had money in the 
development of two florida shopping centers the first sold and all 
went well when the second sold she said the money was dispersed 
to the other partners and her bank credit wasnt paid off 
they sent a federal marshal to our house they were going to 
take everything we had and we didnt owe the money she said 
i think they thought we wouldnt want my name dragged through 
fighting that whether they dragged my name through mud or not we 
had to do it they wanted 12 million if you dont owe it why 
pay it wed worked too hard to have what we had to let somebody 
take it we made a settlement of 450000 in november and didnt 
get the paperwork done until march 9 we paid them and theyre out 
of our life now 
richey said three bankers were indicted in the case 
we couldnt explain this while we were in litigation 
wynette said i had to just say yes id filed for bankruptcy 
it was horrible to have to go through it you dont think people 
will do that to you its over with thats all that matters now 
paul richey her husbands brother and ed bruce who wrote 
mamas dont let your babies grow up to be cowboys wrote the 
current single thank the cowboy for the ride 
its a cute little song wynette said it starts he was 
pushing 7 and i was barely 5 when he rode up on his broomstick 
horse and said you want a ride it goes on hes almost 67 i 
admit to 39 when ive done it on stage old and young people love 
it 
her favorite song written with her husband is till i can make 
it on my own 
george jones and i had just divorced the song said exactly 
what i was living she and jones worked together after the 
divorce but stopped that several years ago 
hes happy im happy our daughter is happy we had magic 
years ago to try and go back and recapture that would probably be 
a mistake its probably best we leave it like it is

ask russ mittermeier about his work and hell 
talk about marketing the hard sell tough choices and money just 
what you might expect from a sales executive or investment 
counselor 
mittermeier however is a wildlife biologist and vice president 
for science of the world wildlife fund hes talking about 
marketing conservation in countries where people struggle to find 
their next meal hes deciding how to get the most from a limited 
pool of conservation dollars 
his approach is a sign of a new discipline among 
conservationists as they try to sharpen the conservation blueprint 
for the 1990s 
i think weve got the potential to find the resources to make 
conservation work he said we really have to make good 
conservation an element of good development 
other conservationists are thinking along similar lines in 
january the world resources institute issued a report titled 
the crucial decade the 1990s and the global environmental 
challenge 
if efforts to save species and biological diversity are to 
succeed a more coordinated systematic and aggressive 
international effort is needed the report said the 1990s will 
be the crucial decade for action on these pressing concerns 
without a major effort it said irreparable damage will be 
done to the worlds environment and the problems will prove 
increasingly intractable expensive and dominated by crises 
mittermeier is trying to save endangered animals saving animals 
means saving habitat the most carefully protected animals cannot 
survive if they have no place to live 
so much has been said about the loss of habitat that the mere 
recitation of statistics has lost its force each year about 
42000 square miles of tropical forest are lost almost enough to 
cover the state of new york 
its anybodys guess how many plant and animal species are 
disappearing 
in a report titled biodiversity harvard biologist eo 
wilson tweaked the numbers and came up with this species are being 
lost 1000 to 10000 times as fast as they were before human beings 
arrived on the scene 
by the turn of the century much of the remaining tropical 
forest is going to be in isolated parks surrounded by 
development said mittermeier there will be very few places 
where natural evolutionary processes continue where traditional 
people continue to live traditional lifestyles 
mittermeier and his colleagues have established three lines of 
attack to try to limit the damage 
theyve identified 10 threatened hot spots small forested 
regions in immediate danger the hot spots cover twotenths of 1 
percent of the earths surface but harbor 27 percent of all 
tropical forest plant species 
theyve targeted 13 countries as megadiversity countries 
for their unusually rich animal and plant life these countries 
contain at least 60 percent of the worlds plant and animal species 
and theyve identified what they call major wilderness areas 
the few places still mostly undisturbed where if steps are taken 
soon evolution can continue and traditional people can survive 
the threatened hot spots idea came from norman myers a 
senior fellow at the world wildlife fund 
without emergency aid the 10 hot spots are likely to lose 
90 percent of their forest cover within the next decade that would 
mean losing almost 7 percent of the earths 5 million to 30 million 
plant and animal species 
apart from madagascar and new caledonia the threatened hot 
spots are in south american and asia south americas are in the 
choco region of colombia western ecuador the uplands of western 
amazonia and the atlantic coast of brazil 
asias are in the philippines northern borneo malaysia and the 
eastern himalayas 
many of the species in these areas have already been lost or 
will soon be lost even if the areas are left untouched from now 
on myers said the rule of thumb is that for half of the species 
to survive the remaining forest must cover at least 10 percent of 
its original range 
myers says that is hardly ever the case 
mittermeier developed the concept of megadiversity countries 
as a marketing device its tremendously valuable he said it 
can be used in the megadiversity countries to excite the public 
about conservation 
its a source of national pride he said it tells them 
in terms of natural resources were pretty special its an 
effective way of selling conservation to them and to 
foundations 
because these countries contain at least 60 percent and perhaps 
even 80 percent of the worlds species they ought to get 60 
percent or 70 percent of conservation funds mittermeier has 
proposed 
the countries are mexico venezuela colombia ecuador peru 
brazil zaire madagascar indonesia australia india china and 
malaysia 
mittermeier whose research specialty is primates said brazil 
zaire indonesia and madagascar contain twothirds of the worlds 
primate species if we arent successful in saving primate 
species in these countries were going to lose a major portion of 
the species he said 
were not writing off the rest of the world were saying do 
something in every country on earth but strategically when we do 
our planning these countries should get a major chunk of the 
interest a major chunk of the investment 
there is some good news in this story mittermeier and company 
have identified five major wilderness areas that have a good chance 
of survival 
these areas are not under immediate threat he said it 
wont require a large investment to save them you just have to 
point out to the countries that this is something you should invest 
in for the future he said 
they are in new guinea central zaire venezuela south of the 
orinoco river parts of upper amazonia and in a region that cuts 
across southern suriname guyana and french guiana 
the other bit of good news is that the world bank where 
mittermeier has served as manager of a task force on biodiversity 
takes conservation seriously 
the banks mission traditionally has been to foster development 
in poor countries which often put it in conflict with 
environmentalists it made an important change in 1986 with the 
adoption of a wildlands policy 
wildlands can often contribute significantly to economic 
development the bank said the banks policy is therefore to 
seek a balance between preserving the environmental values of the 
worlds more important remaining wildlands and converting some of 
them to more intensive shorter term use 
mittermeier said conservationists should do two things to try to 
save remaining forests the first is to expand the number and size 
of protected areas but that has its limitations 
they are expensive and will compose at best only five to 10 
percent of the worlds land area mittermeier said 
the second tactic is to encourage profitable use of the forests 
that doesnt destroy them researchers recently found for example 
that harvesting latex fruit and wood from a managed forest was 
three times as profitable as cutting it down to produce pulpwood or 
raise crops or cattle mittermeier said 
development inevitably comes back to depending on natural 
resources he said and if you dont use natural resources 
wisely your development efforts and your global economy are 
eventually going to go down the tube

microscopic motors the width of several 
human hairs are running at high speed at a university laboratory 
where researchers believe they can drive tiny saws and drills or 
dispense medicine inside the human body 
the devices called wobble motors have a tiny hairlike rod 
inside the wall of a shaft that runs on electrostatic force instead 
of the electromagnetic force used by regular motors 
one wobble motor that has a diameter of 560 microns has made 
some 6 billion revolutions said dr stephen c jacobsen director 
of the university of utahs center for engineering design 
a micron is one millionth of a meter a human hair is 80 microns 
thick tests have started on a wobble motor 200 microns in diameter 
other labs have produced microelectromechanical systems mems 
of about 100 microns but the universitys wobble motors are the 
first to operate for sustained periods more than three lifespans 
of car engines said jacobsen 
the device is called a wobble motor because the armature wobbles 
slightly as it rolls around the inside of the motor since it 
rolls instead of sliding as a normal armature turns friction is 
greatly reduced making it unnecessary to solve the problem of 
lubrication jacobsen said 
speeds of more than 120000 wobbles per minute have been 
achieved by the motor he said and the researchers expect speeds 
of up to 500000 wobbles per minute in the near future 
the rotation produces high torque which could be harnessed to 
tiny saws knives claws or other devices to grip cut twist or do 
other work in a controlled fashion 
weve used it with a micro drill using a 0002inch bit 
jacobsen said 
the wobble motor marks a significant advance in the race with 
japan and with several other us research institutions in 
developing mems said jacobsen 
the potential of such devices is enormous jacobsen said they 
could be used to operate tiny pumps that would dispense medication 
within the body 
they could be put on the end of catheters for removing 
deposits in arteries and they can be used to make other small 
machines he said with their ability to go from full speed to 
zero in thousandths of a second they also can be used to direct 
light beams 
they have applications in scientific instruments measuring 
devices sensors manipulation of biological materials artificial 
limbs display terminals filters and in computer memory 
most of the mems are manufactured in the same way that 
ultrathin circuits are etched in the production of computer 
microcircuit chips 
the universitys wobble motors are manufactured by a number of 
techniques including extrusion of the motor under pressure this 
microinjection molding is done at pressures up to 20000 pounds per 
square inch 
the technique offers the possibility of producing wobble motors 
resembling hairthin spaghetti cutting off as much as one needs 
the universitys project has been financed by a grant from the 
defense advanced research projects agency and by the systems 
development foundation 
work began six years ago at the university as an outgrowth of 
research on the utah artificial arm and the utahmit dextrous hand 
a robotic limb built to mimic the human hand 
in addition to micromotors the researchers also are developing 
microscopic actuators sensors and other microsystem components

the largest and longest study yet on the 
antiaging effects of retina confirms that the acne cream does 
smooth wrinkles but reducing doses apparently reduces its 
effectiveness researchers say 
there is no question that the more you use the more you 
improve said university of arizona researcher clayton owens 
in those people who used the strongest doses what we saw was a 
decrease in fine wrinkling in roughness and in uneven coloring 
the university of michigan found a year ago that retina a 
synthetic form of vitamin a known as tretinoin long used to treat 
acne dramatically reduced the ravages of aging and sun damage in 
a shortterm study of about 30 people 
since then nationwide studies have been under way on how well 
it works and whether it is safe the federal government has yet to 
approve it for this use but its available by prescription from 
physicians 
last year the us food and drug administration issued a strong 
statement condemning indiscriminate use of retina to treat 
wrinkles 
fda commissioner frank e young said there is no conclusive 
evidence the drug reduces wrinkles longterm animal studies and 
wellcontrolled clinical trials involving larger numbers of 
patients in various age groups are needed to assess the risks and 
benefits he said 
the michigan study used a high dose of the drug and patients 
suffered significant known side effects of retina peeling 
burning redness and overall irritation of the skin 
a sixmonth study of more than 300 patients last year at the 
university of arizona duke university new york university and the 
university of minnesota used lower and varying doses of the drug to 
learn whether side effects could be eased while still getting the 
positive antiaging effects owens said 
divided into four groups the 300plus patients used daily doses 
of retina ranging from the highest tretinoin concentration of 
005 to a moderate dose of 001 to a weak dose of 0001 to a 
zerodose in the placebo group the michigan study used 
concentrations twice as high at 010 strength 
nearly 90 percent of patients using the 005 dose showed at 
least some improvement with half showing moderate to strong 
improvement said owens those using lower doses showed some 
effects of the retina but the results were much weaker and 
questionable he said 
the patients in the study were from 50 to 70 years old and were 
chosen because they showed moderate not severe signs of 
sundamaged skin mostly fine but also some coarse wrinkling also 
blotchy coloring and rough texture 
all of these factors were visibly and statistically rated as 
were the side effects in addition the length and depth of 
wrinkles were measured in plastic impressions and skin biopsies 
were analyzed microscopically 
patients used the retina daily along with sunscreens and 
moisturizers 
the biggest improvement was in the skin pigment in evening 
out the skins color and getting rid of blotches and brown spots 
said owens the next biggest improvment was in fine wrinkling 
the crosshatches below the eye and in the crowsfeet area after 
that we saw improvement in texture in smoothing out rough skin 
there was also some improvement in deeper coarser wrinkles in 
some patients but since that problem was not prevalent in most of 
the patients it was difficult to measure that impact 
scientifically he said 
owens also said the side effects of retina were less than 
expected 
most people had mild to moderate side effects mostly peeling 
and some redness by and large the side effects were tolerated 
well usually the effects would last a few days then go away 
then come back for a few days after a few months the skin seems 
to get used to the drug only three or four people had constant 
irritation but nobody had any serious problems 
so what is the best dosage of retina to halt the ravages of 
time 
i know this will sound like a copout owens answered but 
that is something that has to be determined between the patient and 
the doctor people react differently to the stuff the doctor has 
to assess your skin type he will know when the irritation is too 
much and if you are using enough to get good results that is why 
retina will remain a prescription drug for some time

the space shuttles robot arm will tow a 
10footdiameter stainless steel dishlike wake shield on four 
future missions to research the manufacture of superthin films in 
the vacuum of space 
scientists say the shuttles wake area similar to the wake left 
by a ship in water is a region of ultra vacuum that will allow 
the formation of ultrathin highestgrade semiconductors and 
hightemperature superconductors 
the dish will be built by the university of houstons space 
vacuum epitaxy center under a 55 million nasa grant announced may 
16 
alex ignatiev a physics professor and director of the schools 
space vacuum epitaxy center said the experiments should be ready 
in 30 months and will fly the first of four missions in the fall of 
1991 
he defined epitaxial growth as the formation of a new material 
atom by atom layer by layer possible only in a perfect or 
nearperfect vacuum 
on the first flight a crystalline wafer of poorquality 
gallium arsenide heated and then evaporated in space is expected 
to yield several thousand atomic layers of a much higher quality 
gallium arsenide 
he said the materials have to potential to make semiconductors 
and superconductors that perform five or 10 times faster than 
current technology yet use up to 10 percent less power

studies of hearths and discarded seashells 
at old indian sites suggest huge earthquakes struck the northwest 
in the last 300 to 400 years far more recently than previously 
believed geologists say 
geologists rick minor and wendy grant presented papers may 9 to 
a geological society of america convention which correlate sudden 
dramatic changes in land levels to disruptions of indian 
communities 
previous evidence suggested the last major quake was 3000 or 
more years ago but grant and minor said carbon dating of hearth 
sites and layers of shellfish eaten by coast dwellers show periods 
where habitation abruptly ended these periods can be correlated to 
evidence of dramatic drops in land levels followed by a tsunami a 
giant wave associated with large earthquakes grant said 
scientists caution that carbon dating is imprecise and that the 
evidence while intriguing is circumstantial 
minor said indian folklore contains no reference to the giant 
quakes he speculated that diseases introduced by european settlers 
may have wiped out the tribes and their ancient oral traditions by 
the time ethnographers began studying the tribes in the early 1900s

oregon state university scientists are 
learning to track the evolution of a species through genetic 
studies of conifers dating back to the oldest living plant the 
bristlecone pine 
the bristlecone pine which can live up to 4000 years in rocky 
cold terrain is the oldest on earth and a common ancestor to all 
modern pine species the scientists said they determined 
with genetic techniques we were able to figure out with a 
high degree of confidence which pine species evolved from which 
said steven strauss an assistant professor of forest science 
the bristlecone pine probably has been around for most of the 
130 million years that pine trees are evident in the fossil record 
and some alive today sprouted about 2000 bc the scientists said 
strauss a plant geneticist is trying to engineer useful traits 
into the genetic makeup of conifers like the pine 
eventually it may be possible to create trees that grow faster 
taller and more resistant to insects and disease

a babys birthweight is one of the first details 
of a new life that parents share with relatives but in some third 
world countries that important detail often tells whether a 
newborn will live or die 
and often that weight goes unknown because the baby is born at 
home and few birth attendants have accurate scales 
the program for appropriate technology in health has developed a 
portable weighing mechanism birthweigh that can be provided 
cheaply to poor countries 
the scale has no numbers it shows a square of blue if the baby 
is heavy enough over 25 kilos or about 55 pounds to survive 
without special medical attention and a yellow one if it isnt 
birthweigh is one of several health devices path has developed 
since it was established in 1976 as the program for the 
introduction and adaptation of contraceptive technology 
the nonprofit organizations today known just as path have 
sponsored more than 500 health programs in more than 30 nations 
world including birth control immunization campaigns and 
information for people who cant read 
family planning work led piact to realize that birth control was 
just a small part of what was needed to improve the lives of the 
third world poor this led to the creation of path in 1980 
birth control is still what path does most it started condom

bangladesh and provided coppert interuterine devices to 
brazilian women

percent of paths funds prohibits it from using money for abortion

congress and the bush administration once 
intent on rushing to the rescue of savings and loan depositors 
have paused to wage an ardent battle over a seemingly arcane 
accounting question 
should the savings and loan bailout be onbudget or offbudget 
one side composed principally of house democrats wants to 
include bailout spending in the budget but give it a special 
exemption from the grammrudman deficit reduction law to avoid the 
laws automatic spending cuts in the overall budget 
the other side the republican administration is arguing for 
an offbudget plan that would borrow 50 billion for the bailout 
without counting it toward the deficit 
a third variation pushed by senate democrats includes the 
spending in the budget but loads all of it into the 1989 fiscal 
year ending sept 30 that indirectly evades grammrudman because 
the deadlines that could have triggered spending cuts for this year 
already have expired 
the terminology of the debate is obscure and the arguments 
confusing to nearly everyone but a government accountant 
occasionally the debaters throw in a jibe about dishonest 
accounting or the breakdown of budget discipline 
to the taxpayer it doesnt seem to matter that much all of the 
sides after all simply are proposing different ways of getting 
around the grammrudman law and no matter what plan is eventually 
adopted the public ends up picking up most of the tab upwards of 
300 billion over 30 years 
but to the debaters it matters a lot congressional democrats 
think their position is important enough to risk being blamed for 
delaying sampl legislation and allowing the crisis to get worse 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady is threatening to recommend 
a veto of any bill with onbudget financing inviting democrats to 
tag the administration with a similar obstructionist label 
publicly the arguments run something like this 
democrats our plan is cheaper it allows the government to 
borrow at a lower cost and its more honest because all of the 
sampl spending will show up in the deficit 
republicans your plan destroys any spending discipline imposed 
by grammrudman if adopted congress will be tempted to evade 
grammrudman to pay for any costly problem and that threat will 
scare the financial markets into driving up all interest rates 
negating any savings produced by the onbudget plan 
but the ardor of both sides has very little to do those 
arguments and very much to do with the constant dance of politics 
that surrounds the republican effort to avoid getting blamed for 
any future tax increase and the democratic desire to block further 
spending cuts 
george bush got elected to the presidency on his read my lips 
no new taxes pledge and democrats would dearly love to force him 
to mouth different words 
the administration and congress reached a relatively easy budget 
accord for 1990 avoiding both taxes and painful spending cuts but 
that will become more difficult and the hardball will become harder 
as the 1992 election draws closer 
democrats know theres an advantage to their plan beyond any 
savings it might produce even with the threat of automatic 
spending cuts removed an onbudget sampl plan would embarrass bush 
and increase the pressure on him to abandon his tax pledge 
the senate proposal would add 50 billion to the 1989 deficit 
ballooning it within range of the alltime record of 221 billion 
set in 1986 not an auspicious start for bush 
the house method approved last thursday by the ways and means 
committee adds only about 10 billion to the 1989 deficit but it 
inflates 1990 red ink by about 25 billion and the 1991 budget gap 
by about 15 billion destroying any hope of maintaining an 
illusion of progress on the deficit 
the maneuvering between congress and the administration has 
deteriorated now into a game of chicken with each side trying to 
blame the other for holding up the sampl rescue and hoping in the end 
that neither side will be willing to scuttle the rescue over the 
budget question 
the next hurdle is the full house chances are good that an 
onbudget plan could pass there in early june then comes a 
conference committee between the house and senate where the senate 
delegation will be led by banking committee chairman donald riegle 
dmich an onbudget advocate 
assuming the conference committee approves an onbudget plan 
one last and major hurdle remains both the house and senate would 
have to separately approve any conference legislation and because 
the bill will by necessity change the 1989 budget adopted by 
congress the senate must pass the funding part of it by 60 votes 
there are 55 democrats in the senate so democrats would have to 
hold all of their own votes and peel off five republicans thus it 
will likely fall to senate republicans to save the administration 
from having to choose between making good on its veto threat or 
publicly backing down

the board of holly farms inc has approved 
a sweetened 138 billion buyout bid from conagra inc more than a 
month after holly farms shareholders turned down an earlier 
agreement with the rival poultry producer 
but tyson foods inc which has been trying to take over holly 
farms since october today extended its 6350ashare offer 
tysons tender offer will expire on tuesday at 5 pm edt tyson 
said it had received tenders of about 89 million shares of holly 
farms common stock by the close of business friday which was the 
previous deadline 
conagras new 7481ashare stock swap proposal to acquire 
memphisbased holly farms is worth a total of 138 billion at 
current stock prices 
that is significantly higher than a 11 billion proposal turned 
down at a holly farms shareholders meeting april 14 and higher than 
tysons allcash offer which comes to 115 billion 
under the new agreement each of holly farms 184 million 
outstanding shares would be exchanged for 21 conagra shares 
conagra stock closed at 3562 a share in new york stock exchange 
composite trading friday meaning holly farms shareholders would 
receive stock worth 7481 per share 
holly farms closed at 6262 on the nyse on friday 
were not through trying to compete for the company james 
blair tysons general counsel said in an interview in new york 
sunday 
blair said tyson would consider its options and see how 
investors react to the new agreement he also noted that litigation 
connected with the takeover battle continues in courts in delaware 
and said tyson would await the outcome of the lawsuits before 
deciding what it would do 
holly farms management has consistently shunned tysons bids 
although they have been higher than previous conagra proposals 
conagra first bid for holly farms in november 
after shareholderse rejected the deal with omaha nebbased 
conagra holly farms reopened bidding tyson has charged the 
auction process was unfair and blair said sunday his company was 
trying to find a way that we could compete on a level playing 
field and compete fairly 
a delaware chancery court judge last week agreed that the 
bidding procedures were unfair to springdale arkbased tyson but 
said there were no legal grounds to halt the auction 
under the previous holly farmsconagra agreement holly farms 
agreed to sell conagra certain of its assets if the proposed buyout 
fell through however the agreement approved by the holly farms 
board late saturday night removed that provision known as a 
lockup agreement 
the newest offer is subject to approval of the holly farms 
shareholders which were lobbied heavily by tyson before the last 
vote 
holly farms vice president ted bailey said the company hoped to 
have another shareholder vote by the end of july 
bailey said the new agreement also allows holly farms to 
terminate the deal if it receives a higher offer holly farms 
agreed to pay conagra a fee of 15 million plus actual expenses if 
the agreement fails 
tyson has objected to that fee agreement blair said sunday 
holly farms shareholders were being forced to vote for the 
agreement or have millions of dollars taken away from the firm

the number of working oil and gas rigs in the 
united states this week plunged by 34 to total 737 baker hughes 
inc reported today 
among the major oil producing states texas was the big loser 
with its rig count dropping by 23 the company said 
last week the count had climbed for the second straight week 
increasing by seven to total 771 a year ago the count was 892 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively 
producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
others major oil producing states didnt suffer as big a loss as 
texas california which had five more rigs this week was the only 
state to see an increase 
colorado north dakota new mexico oklahoma and kansas all lost

a federal bankruptcy judge today gave eastern 
airlines another day to consider rival buyout offers for its 
northeast shuttle business 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland adjourned until tuesday 
a hearing at which attorneys for miamibased eastern its unions 
and its major creditors were to meet to discuss competing offers 
for the shuttle by america west airlines and developer donald trump 
eastern and a committee representing its major creditors sought 
the additional time so they could continue evaluating the bids 
last week court officials labeled as inadequate buyout 
proposals for eastern submitted by two investor groups lifland 
approved the idea of selling the airlines prized northeast 
shuttle and easterns own plan to sell 18 billion in assets and 
reorganize as a smaller carrier gained momentum 
on wednesday lifland gave eastern permission to lease 14 boeing 
727200s to pan am corp for 579 million over three years as part 
of its restructuring plan eastern had signed a tentative agreement 
with pan am to lease the jets for 966 million over five years 
eastern has announced similar agreements with other carriers in 
recent weeks but the pan am deal was the first approved by the 
bankruptcy court 
eastern has been under chapter 11 protection from creditors 
since march 9 five days after the start of a paralyzing strike by 
its machinists union that was supported by pilots and flight 
attendants 
the bankruptcy court must approve any sale of eastern or any of 
its assets including the shuttle service 
david i shapiro the courtappointed bankruptcy examiner for 
eastern said last week there were no real live offers to buy 
the entire carrier he challenged the prospective suitors to risk 
at least 100 million of their own cash for any purchase 
two investor groups one headed by chicago commodities trader 
joseph ritchie and the other led by former piedmont airlines 
chairman william howard have submitted formal bids 
florida gov bob martinez may try to use the states 17 billion 
pension fund to back a buyout by the ritchie or howard group in an 
effort to protect jobs provided by the airline according to 
newspaper reports sunday 
the miami herald and the palm beach post reported that a state 
investment of at least 50 million was being considered given the 
proper guarantees against loss 
at the time the strike began eastern employed about 30000 
workers including 12000 in florida 
lifland meanwhile said eastern had provided valid reasons for 
its plan to sell the new yorkwashingtonboston shuttle eastern 
already has an agreement to sell the shuttle to developer donald 
trump for 365 million but last week lifland gave the airline 
until today to consider a higher bid by america west airlines 
joel zweibel the attorney representing easterns major 
creditors said they supported a prompt sale of the shuttle 
the growing likelihood of a shuttle sale coupled with the 
apparent lack of sufficient buyout offers for the whole airline 
bolster easterns proposed plan to cut its size and sell another 
14 billion or so in assets separately some observers believe 
phoenixbased america west has offered to pay 415 million for 
the shuttle and 336 million for 10 boeing 757s in a total package 
worth 751 million 
trumps agreement with easterns parent texas air corp expires 
may 27 under their contract the developer would receive 8 
million from eastern if the shuttle deal collapses 
america west has said it would not employ eastern workers if it 
purchased the shuttle while trump has recognized the eastern 
unions as representatives for employees of his shuttle 
on thursday pilots union leaders at eastern reversed their 
earlier position and said 170 eastern pilots could work for the 
shuttle if it is sold to trump

warner communications inc said today it settled 
a longstanding dispute with its largest shareholder clearing 
another potential obstacle to the entertainment companys planned 
18 billion merger with time inc 
the shareholder chriscraft industries inc joined time and 
warner in announcing the settlement that the companies said would 
permit the time merger with warner to proceed without any delay 
or adjustment 
the merger would create the worlds largest media and 
entertainment concern with 10 billion in assets 
warner and chriscraft had entered an agreement in 1984 in which 
they acquired stakes in each other in what was seen as a defensive 
manuever by warner to avoid a hostile takeover 
warner bought about 425 percent of chriscrafts broadcasting 
subsidiary bhc inc while chriscraft bought a stake in warner 
that now amounts to about 17 percent warner agreed to refrain from 
acquiring a television station or making make certain changes in 
control while the pact with chriscraft was in effect 
but in the years since the pact was signed relations soured 
between warner and chriscraft and there was some concern it could 
delay the proposed warner merger with time 
earlier this month warner sued chriscraft seeking an order 
that would have compelled chriscraft to resolve any objections to 
the merger that litigation was resolved under the settlement 
warner spokesman geoffrey holmes said 
under the settlement warner said it will offer to sell its 
shares in bhc to third parties chriscraft would have the right of 
first refusal to purchase warners interest in bhc or require 
warner to spin off its interest in bhc to time warner shareholders 
after the merger 
warner is ending its right of first refusal on the warner shares 
held by chriscraft as part of the agreement 
we are delighted that despite our earlier differences the 
relationship between wci and chriscraft is ending on a 
constructive and amicable basis and in the best interests of all 
the shareholders and the concerned parties the chairmen and 
chief executives of both companies steven j ross of warner and 
herbert j siegel of chriscraft said in a joint statement 
siegel was quoted as saying time warner will be the premier 
media and entertainment company in the world and i wish it well 
siegel was said to be unavailable for comment upon the merger 
bhc will be timewarners largest shareholder owning about 11 
percent of time warner stock

the dollar steadied at higher levels in europe 
late monday after central banks intervened to push the us 
currency lower 
gold prices fell as much as 650 an ounce in morning trading 
the dollar surged in the first hour of european trading and 
continued to gain momentum as it broke through several important 
resistance points 
after peaking in midday dealings the dollar settled in a fairly 
narrow range before a wave of central bank intervention pushed the 
currency lower late in the session 
with the us federal reserve reportedly intervening in concert 
with several major european central banks the dollar slipped 
temporarily back toward the end of the day but quickly recouped 
some of its losses 
the deutsche bundesbank following its recent pattern abstained 
from the intervention 
the bank of italy confirmed it participated in a concerted 
effort to push the dollar lower as did the bank of belgium 
the british and swiss central banks also participated dealers 
said 
but dealers said they expected the impact of the dollar sales to 
be fleeting 
in rome one trader attributed mondays surge to panicbuying 
based on the markets perception that the group of seven 
industrialized nations cannot agree on policies to stabilize 
currency rates 
the market is very violent and rather irrational said 
another trader 
in london the british pound was quoted at 15815 late in the 
afternoon compared with 15750 at midmorning and 16190 late 
friday 
other dollar rates at late afternoon compared with late rates 
on friday and with midmorning rates in parentheses included 
20075 20135 west german marks up from 11995 17925 17985 
swiss francs up from 17583 67895 68140 french francs up 
from 66700 22640 22598 dutch guilders up from 22210 
145575 146250 italian lire up from 143500 and 11955 
11935 canadian dollars up from 11911 
earlier in tokyo the dollar rose despite sizeable bank of japan 
intervention closing 168 yen higher at 14045 yen the first time 
the dollar has closed above 140 yen since oct 28 1987 later in 
london it was quoted at 14255 yen 
the dollars rise hit precious metals sharply 
gold opened in london at a bid price of 36180 a troy ounce 
compared with late fridays 36575 at midmorning the citys five 
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of 35925 
in zurich the bid price for gold was 360 compared with 36525 
late friday 
earlier in hong kong gold fell 601 to close at a bid of 
36121 
silver was quoted in london at a bid price of 507 a troy 
ounce down from fridays 535

ideology is not rigid it is not dogma sooner 
or later it must accommodate reality a process seldom undertaken 
without difficulty and controversy 
that observation was made several years ago by prof george 
lodge in the american disease a book about the transformation 
of american capitalism but it fits neatly with what is occurring 
in china 
values may persist from generation to generation but ideology 
must accommodate change lodge said sometimes it doesnt outmoded 
ideology tends to linger while people and institutions depart from 
it in pragmatic ways 
eventually we can no longer practice what we preach and we 
are not yet able to preach what we practice said lodge who 
teaches at harvard business school 
the result an ideological schizophrenia new practices bring 
forth a new ideology to justify itself but loyalty to old ways 
discourages articulation a legitimacy gap develops the old hymns 
are still sung but practices change 
as the gap widens two conflicting pressures converge one 
seeking to force errant institutions back into conformity with the 
old theology and the other seeking more forceful expression of the 
new ideology 
what china and the entire socialist world are experiencing is 
probably nothing new when viewed in this context except perhaps in 
the sharpness of the convergence how do you erect monuments to 
marx and ignore him too 
lodges book written in 1984 was an attempt to describe how 
the two great political ideologies of individualism and 
communitarianism interact in a changing america one that casually 
identifies itself as capitalistic 
but as he and others have pointed out raw individualism in the 
united states has been muted by the necessities of community 
interests and now in china and other socialist nations 
individualism forces communism to evolve 
in the united states change was anticipated and institutions 
erected to make change peaceful and in a century of slow but 
constant change capitalism has evolved into something vastly 
different from what it was 
thirtyeight years ago william i nichols editor of this 
week magazine wrote an article called wanted a new name for 
capitalism he felt that in too many peoples minds especially 
the minds of foreigners it stand for the primitive economic 
system of the nineteenth century 
how he asked shall we describe this system imperfect but 
always improving and always capable of further improvement where 
men move forward together working together building together 
producing always more and more and sharing together the rewards of 
their increased production 
as told by frederick lewis allen in his social history the 
big change nichols had heard various suggestions such as the 
new capitalism or democratic capitalism economic 
democracy industrial democracy distributism 
mutualism and productivism 
could there be a more descriptive name he wondered and so he 
asked his readers he got 15000 responses never in my whole 
editorial experience said nichol have i touched so live a 
nerve 
but just as a china experimenting with individualism may 
continue to sing the hymns of communism the united states is still 
referred to as capitalist america

the white house in an apparent coordinated 
effort with the federal reserve board today moved to try to halt 
the surge of the dollars value abroad declaring that a further 
rise could undermine international efforts to reduce global trade 
imbalances 
the statement the first time the white house has commented 
directly on the dollar since president bush took office appeared 
to be tied to a latemorning selloff of dollars by the federal 
reserve in international currency markets traders and analysts 
said 
and it followed hectic trading in european markets during which 
the fed and counterpart central banks of japan britain west 
germany and other european nations reportedly were making heavy 
sales of dollars 
selling dollars can help to drive their price down against other 
major currencies 
david wyss chief financial economist at data resources inc 
said the fed began selling off dollars about the time of the 
statement it was calculated to have a combined impact 
unfortunately the market is shrugging it off 
todays white house statement was clearly designed to invite 
international action to halt the dollars rise apparently 
including heavier intervention by the federal reserve and other 
central banks to stabilize the currency 
a statement read by deputy white house press secretary roman 
popadiuk said the climbing dollar is a matter of concern that 
has also prompted questioning of the administrations commitment 
to the process of economic policy coordination among the group of 
seven major industrial democracies 
it was a reference to united states britain japan france 
west germany italy and canada who have jointly vowed to take 
concerted efforts to stabilize currencies through a variety of 
steps including direct intervention in exchange markets by central 
banks and adjustments in interest rates 
the administration remains fully committed to this process if 
the dollars recent rise against other major currencies is 
sustained for a prolonged period or extended it could undermine 
international efforts to reduce global trade imbalances the 
white house statement said 
accordingly we will continue our efforts to strengthen 
underlying policies that promote the adjustment of external 
imbalances as well as cooperating in exchange markets as agreed 
by the seven nations the statement said 
although the statement appeared to represent an administration 
call for the federal reserve and other central banks to do more to 
stabilize the dollar popadiuk refused to elaborate on it claiming 
its spoke for itself 
the president and the secretary of the treasury remain the 
administrations sole spokesmen on the dollar and exchange rate 
policy he said 
the dollars surge against other major currencies has threatened 
to undue recent improvements in the us trade deficit a stronger 
dollar makes imported good less expensive in us markets 
aggravating the deficit 
recent intervention by central banks buying and selling of 
dollars directly has failed to stem the rise of the currency 
even an increase in a key interest rate last month by the west 
germanys central bank a move that would usually help weaken the 
dollar failed to have much impact on the dollars rise

fundamentals 
touching off mondays plunge was the dollars rise above 2 west

the us dollar surged in hectic european trading 
monday but ended well below its session peaks as profittaking 
slowed the currencys rapid advance 
heavy repeated centralbank intervention had little impact 
dealers said 
gold prices hurt by the strong dollar fell more than 5 an 
ounce 
the dollar pushed through the 2west german mark level early in 
the european day for the first time since december 1986 that 
prompted a wave of new buying that took the us currency up to a 
session high of around 20190 marks 
the dollar rose nearly 4 cents against the british pound and 
more than 3 yen 
heavy overnight intervention by the bank of japan which some 
dealers estimated sold 15 billion for yen had little impact on 
the dollars strength as did intervention by the us federal 
reserve and european central banks later in the day dealers said 
the fed came in a second time in the afternoon again with 
little impact they said the bank of england reportedly intervened 
four times with the first round apparently the heaviest dealers 
said 
dealers attributed the dollars move below its peaks to 
profittaking rather than the impact of intervention 
in london the dollar rose to its highest level since august 
1987 it cost 15810 to buy one pound cheaper than 16190 late 
friday

weather forecasts and the continued rise in the value of the dollar 
there was precipitation during the weekend in major crop areas 
that were suffering from dryness in addition the national weather 
services 6 to 10day forecast starting thursday calls for normal 
or abovenormal rainfall for most areas 
joel karlin an analyst with research department inc in 
chicago said tarding remainmed in a narrow range after a drop at 
the opening 
but the sentiment was so negative we couldnt mount a 
rally he said 
adding to the markets woes is the strength of the dollar which 
analysts say is likely to curtail export of grains 
particularly affected by the rising dollar are soybean futures 
foreign demand for us soybeans has dropped with the dollars 
rise with some countries turning to brazil for their supplies 
the momentum in the market is on the down side karlin said 
adding that despite the low prices no one is coming in to buy 
there is a real deflationary sentiment in all the markets

contract for delivery in july at 394 a bushel corn was 5 cents

international turmoil that has sparked demand 
for the us dollar as a safe investment haven is a key factor in 
the currencys recent surge in foreign exchange treasury secretary 
nicholas brady said monday 
in an interview with the milwaukee journal brady said massive 
buying that pushed the dollar to a 19month high monday in tokyo 
had to be viewed in terms of world unrest 
you have a million chinese rioting in the streets he said 
you have nato in an unsettled state of affairs you have in 
japan lack of clear definition of leadership really for the first 
time since the second world war so it doesnt surprise me that 
people pause for a moment and want to put their money in a country 
where the people have settled their leadership question 
brady was in milwaukee mainly to speak to about 750 business 
people and educators at the bairdmanegold lecture series at the 
pfister hotel sponsored by the university of wisconsinmilwaukee 
school of business administration and robert w baird amp co inc 
the dollar has soared in foreign exchange during recent weeks 
despite waves of dollarselling for government central banks the 
dollar on monday traded at levels not seen since december 1986 
against the west german mark and since october 1987 against the 
japanese yen 
the white house on monday in an apparent coordinated effort 
with the federal reserve board issued a statement in washington 
declaring that a further rise could undermine international 
efforts to reduce global trade imbalances 
the statement the first time the white house has commented 
directly on the dollar since president bush took office appeared 
to be tied to a latemorning selloff of dollars by the federal 
reserve in international currency markets traders and analysts 
said 
brady also indicated that recent jumps in inflation stemmed 
partly from onetime factors such as higher energy prices due to 
the alaska oil spill and higher food prices caused by last years 
drought 
the figures i look at without energy and food are pretty 
calm brady said 
in remarks prepared for the luncheon brady said that for the 
united states to sustain and strengthen its position as a world 
economic leader in the next century the government must play a 
role in coordinating economic policies with major trading partners 
in working to abolish barriers to free trade and in reducing the 
cost of capital to corporations 
efforts to coordinate economic policies with trading partners 
helped reduce the us trade deficit last year by 34 billion to 
about 127 billion brady stated

the dollar surged monday smashing the 2mark 
level for the first time in 2 years and hitting a 1year high vs 
the yen despite repeated centralbank selling and a white house 
plea to depress the us currency 
the rally eased interest rates in the credit markets and helped 
cause a huge drop in commodity prices gold in particular was hurt 
falling 3 to a late bid of 36450 a troy ounce republic national 
bank of new york reported the white house issued a statement on 
the dollar its first since president bush took office warning 
that a further increase in the currency could undermine 
international efforts to reduce global trade imbalances 
the statement was in conjuction with repeated dollarselling 
efforts by the federal reserve the bank of japan and several 
european central banks the dollar eased slightly from its highest 
levels but currency analysts attributed that to speculators 
cashing profits on the dollars persistent rally 
currency analysts said the market perceives weakness between the 
united states and its six key trading partners known as the group 
of seven in foreignexchange policies despite official statements 
to the contrary dealers said that was a key element behind the 
dollars strong gains monday 
supporting that sentiment was a story in mondays new york times 
that said some us officials would prefer to rely less heavily on 
intervention and shift to a more flexible dollar policy 
in addition west german bundesbank president karl otto poehl 
said in an interview with the french newspaper le monde he thought 
recent interventions have proven ineffective and that his country 
could live with the firmer dollar the bundesbank was conspiciously 
absent from mondays intervention 
the market seems to be focusing on disarray in the g7 said 
marc chandler a currency analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in 
chicago 
however some analysts contend theres little the g7 can do 
right now to redirect the dollar unless major economic policy 
changes are made 
i think they g7 officials are encountering a situation not 
unlike the situation confronting the chinese government said 
david h resler chief economist for nomura securities inc in new 
york 
they have this huge public sentiment out there that is being 
expressed in ways not to their liking but theres not much they can 
do about it 
the united states could depress the dollar by easing credit 
policies but that could undermine its inflationfighting efforts 
analysts said high us interest rates in comparison to those 
overseas make investments like bonds more attractive to 
foreigners thereby increasing the need to convert their currencies 
to dollars 
also supporting the dollar are growing inflation abroad and 
political uncertainty in west germany and japan analysts said the 
unrest in china also was having a positive effect on the dollar 
they said 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar soared despite sizeable bank of japan 
intervention closing 168 yen higher at 14045 yen the first time 
the dollar has closed above 140 yen since oct 28 1987 it was 
quoted at 14205 yen in london and 14205 yen in new york up from

1987 it cost 15810 to buy one pound cheaper than 16190 late

petroleum futures prices finished mostly lower 
in moderate trading monday amid opecrelated concerns 
on the new york mercantile exchange a lastminute buying binge 
drove the june contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude to 2093 up 33 cents from fridays close 
the june contract which traded as low as 2010 during the 
session expired at the close of trading 
prices of crude oil contracts for delivery later in the year 
were down across the board 
among refined products unleaded gasoline for delivery in june 
fell 129 cents to 6390 cents a gallon while june heating oil 
fell 108 cents to 4698 cents a gallon other contracts also 
closed the session lower 
analysts said worries about opec dominated trading in the crude 
market ahead of the cartels planned june 5 meeting 
peter beutel assistant director of the energy group at elders 
futures inc said lower crude prices reflected concerns that 
various members of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries are producing above their selfimposed output quotas 
an unconfirmed report that kuwait would increase production 
unilaterally if the cartel didnt agree to raise its target level 
sparked some early selling beutel said 
the reports said that kuwait was willing to flood the market 
or increase production because it wants an increase in its quota 
he said 
another report that saudi arabia would ask for a 15 a barrel 
floor on crude prices at the june meeting also fueled selling 
activity said jim steel energy analyst for refco inc 
its just premeeting posturing just a negotiating tactic 
said steel but the saudi statement moved the market

the army announced monday it would award its 
next major handgun contract to the italian arms maker beretta 
saying a congressionally ordered repeat competition had not 
produced a better candidate 
the service in a prepared statement said only two gunmakers 
had taken advantage of the congressional order to enter 9mm guns in 
the new competition smith amp wesson corp of springfield mass 
and sturm ruger amp co of southport conn 
the performance of the beretta usa m9 pistol was significantly 
better than either of the competing weapons the army said in 
summarizing the results during the testing both of the other 
candidate weapons failed some of the mandatory requirements 
berettas victory means the company is in line for an immediate 
contract option order for almost 57000 pistols worth 99 million 
that order will bring to almost 378000 the number of pistols 
ordered by the army 
over the next several years however new orders are expected to 
swell the orders to more than 500000 total according to the army 
assuming congressional leaders accept the test results mondays 
announcement would end a fiveyear battle over the armys decision 
to turn to a foreign company for the handgun that is replacing the 
venerable colt 45 pistol 
testing of replacements began in 1984 of the original eight 
competitors four were eliminated including smith amp wesson and 
two others withdrew the army then selected beretta for the work in 
april 1985 touching off protests from capitol hill 
beretta usa which operates a manufacturing plant in accokeek 
md is a subsidiary of the italian arms maker armi beretta spa 
the massachusetts delegation in particular went to bat for 
smith amp wesson and in 1987 the house appropriations committee told 
the army it would have to stage a new competition before awarding 
additional contracts 
the army grudgingly complied issuing a request for interested 
bidders in may 1988 as the competition began the prospects of 
another winner appeared to improve for a time because of 
wellpublicized problems with cracking metal slides on the beretta 
pistol 
but monday the army said the demonstrated performance of 
the beretta pistol during the competition and the failure of the 
two other candidates to meet the minimum performance requirements 
made its choice easy 
the service refused to spell out which standards the smith amp 
wesson and sturm ruger pistols had failed to meet but the guns 
were being measured on everything from the design of the magazine 
and trigger guard to corrosion protection accuracy reliability 
firing pin energy safety mechanisms and ability to withstand 
various climatic conditions

would acquire memphisbased holly farms in a 7481ashare stock 
swap that values the company at about 138 billion 
the bid tops the 11 billion conagra agreement that holly farms 
shareholders rejected april 14 and the current all cash offer from 
springdalebased tyson which values holly farms at about 115 
billion 
tyson extended its offer until 5 pm tuesday

farms 184 million outstanding shares would be exchanged for 21 
conagra shares

tyson chief counsel jim blair said monday that the new holly 
farms agreement with conagra was unfair and his company filed suit 
in delaware chancery court to block it

asks the court to block holly farms from completing any merger with 
conagra until such time as all the impediments that now keep us 
from now being able to compete on a fair and equal basis are 
eliminated 
holly farms has been rebuffing tyson takeover proposals since 
last october after shareholders rejected its initial deal with 
conagra holly farms reopened bidding for the compan by tyson has 
claimed the auction process was unfair 
last week a delaware chancery court judge agreed that the 
bidding procedures were unfair to tyson but said there were no 
legal grounds to halt the auction 
in a news release monday tyson chairman don tyson said he was 
surprised that holly farms proceeded with the auction process over 
the weekend considering the judges criticism of the process 
we are considering all of our alternatives and have not made 
any decisions as to what we will do tyson said 
under the previous holly farmsconagra agreement holly farms 
agreed to sell conagra certain prize assets if the proposed buyout 
fell through however the agreement approved by the holly farms 
board late saturday night removed that provision known as a 
lockup agreement 
the newest offer is subject to approval by holly farms 
shareholders holly farms vice president ted bailey said the 
company hoped to have another shareholder vote by the end of july 
bailey said the new agreement also allows holly farms to 
terminate the deal if it receives a higher offer holly farms 
agreed to pay conagra a fee of 15 million plus actual expenses if 
the latest agreement falls through

the publishers of entrepreneur magazine said 
monday they intend to begin publishing a magazine designed for 
women who are starting their own businesses 
the magazine will be called entrepreneurial woman which will 
debut with an issue in june and appear once every two months 
starting in february 
this is a business magazine for women said clare thain 
publisher and president of the irvine califbased magazine 
concern there is a great distinction between this magazine and 
publications like working woman and savvy which are lifestyle 
magazines for women who work 
the magazine will provide practical advice on how to start a 
business and keep it running much as the magazine entrepreneur has 
provided 
but thain said entrepreneurial woman will consistently address 
issues of relevance to women such as how to obtain financing and 
how to balance business with family responsibilities as well as 
stories on women role models 
the first issue for instance has stories on cars suited to 
womens entreprenuerial lifestyles the prospects for the 
infantproducts industry and the only woman to run a record label 
thain said he is convinced there is a market for such a magazine 
because one in four subscribers to entrepreneur are women and 
government statistics indicate four out of five new business owners 
are women 
he said his two magazines will not carry the same stories and as 
a result should not dilute the original magazines circulation 
entrepreneur has a circulation rate base of 300000 effective in 
july entrepreneurial woman will have a rate base of 200000

a surge in the dollar and an improved outlook 
for inflation propelled bond prices sharply higher and drove 
interest rates downward monday 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond was up 1316 point or 
nearly 12 for every 1000 in face value its yield fell to 859 
percent the lowest closing yield since march 1988 and was down 
from 870 percent on friday bond prices and yields move in 
opposite directions 
the dollar broke an important psychological barrier 2 west 
german marks and hit a 1year high against the japanese yen 
despite repeated intervention by central banks and a plea from the 
white house to depress the us currency 
the dollars surge helped spark a sharp drop in commodity 
prices and that in turn increased bond traders hopes that 
inflation would slow down and the economy would cool off analysts 
said 
when the economy is slow the federal reserve board is less 
likely to tighten credit which raises interest rates and sends 
bond prices lower 
mitchell held chief financial economist with smith barney 
harris upham amp co said money that had flowed out of bonds as 
interest rates rose was changing direction and moving back into 
treasury securities 
people are realizng the economy is slowing down he said 
people are underinvested in bonds 
ward mccarthy a managing director of stone amp mccarthy research 
associates inc a money market research firm said he expected 
bond prices to continue to move higher because theres a lot of 
people who want to get on the bandwagon 
weve probably seen the high interest rates for this 
business cycle he said 
in the secondary market for treasury securities prices of 
shortterm governments were up between 316 point and 516 point 
intermediate maturities were up between point and 1316 point and 
longterm issues advanced point according to telerate inc the 
financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer jumped 640 to 115497 
in corporate trading industrials also were higher moodys 
investment grade corporate bond index which measures total return 
on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years 
or longer gained 186 to 31401 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds rose 1332 point the average yield to 
maturity fell to 741 percent from 744 percent late friday 
yields on threemonth treasury bills meanwhile slipped to 860 
percent as the discount fell 3 basis points to 832 percent yields 
on sixmonth bills dropped to 876 percent as the discount fell 7 
basis points to 830 percent yields on oneyear bills fell to 876 
as the discount declined 9 basis points to 813 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks was 91116 percent up from 9 percent on friday

condominiums shopping malls and office buildings 
may go on the block as the government disposes of assets from 
failing savings and loans federal deposit insurance corp chairman 
l william seidman said monday 
the agency eventually could control between 300 billion and 
500 billion in failing thrifts assets and sell off between 50 
billion and 100 billion in nonperforming assets such as 
repossessed property seidman said 
the bush administration has proposed creating the resolution 
trust corp as part of its 157 billion sampl bailout plan he said 
it rtc will be in the sole business of restructuring all 
those sampls seidman told reporters before addressing the economic 
club of detroit that means it will probably have to restructure 
the institutions so the private sector can buy them 
taxpayers will pay most of the cost of the bailout plan which 
involves closing or merging more than 500 failed institutions 
what the government did was hand its credit card to a bunch of 
institutions and said here you can borrow on our credit 
thats what deposit insurance is he said now that the people 
who lent them the money want the money back the government either 
pays it or the deposit insurance system fails 
since the government cant allow the deposit insurance system 
to fail the taxpayers will have to pay 
under the plan introduced in february 219 insolvent sampls have 
been placed under fdic conservatorship and another 60 have been 
targeted for takeover by the agency which will guarantee 
depositors assets

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
monday protectionism in world trade will become increasingly 
difficult to sustain as technological advances continue and the 
goods being traded get physically smaller 
greenspan speaking at the annual dinner of the japan society 
said that as technology has progressed economic growth has shifted 
toward analytical advances rather than producing an increased 
physical volume of goods 
oncebulky radios now are powered by pocketsized transistor 
packs metal beverage cans are thinner than they once were tiny 
fiber optics are being used in place of tons of copper and new 
buildings use less concrete glass and steel than they once did 
greenspan said in citing a few examples 
this marked downsizing of economic output has made it easier 
for goods and services to move across national borders and 
creates a dilemma for countries that want to restrict trade he 
said 
the extraordinary downsizing of goods will make protectionism 
increasingly difficult to sustain in the years ahead in the same 
sense that repressive national governments will have difficulty in 
blocking the satellitetransmitted flow of ideas to their people 
greenspan said 
the fed chairman said downsizing also could help relieve 
inflationary bottlenecks in the production process as additional 
supplies from other world producers become more readily and quickly 
available to fill shortages 
as we progress toward general downsizing of economic output 
worldwide production and inventory controls become far more 
feasible and inflationary dislocations less likely greenspan 
said 
he said that while a major world economic disruption could 
quickly bring back earlier protectionist barriers technology is 
irreversible the downsizing of goods will continue 
as a consequence the ability to suppress worldwide trade will 
become progressively more difficult in the decades ahead he said 
greenspan cautioned that while the world trading system 
generally has become more open since the end of world war ii we 
also have seen some significant steps backward 
we do not now have as liberal a trade and marketing 
environment as we will require if we are to continue to reap the 
benefits of specialization downsizing and technological change 
he said 
greenspan said the coordinated efforts of the seven major 
industrialized nations which now hold annual economic summit 
meetings should help hold back protectionism 
this process is bound to expand and become ever more pervasive 
as the crossborder trade in goods and services grows as a 
proportion of world domestic demand he said 
greenspan was introduced at the dinner at a manhattan hotel by 
his predecessor as fed chairman paul a volcker a member of the 
japan societys board 
the japan society describes itself as a nonprofit organization 
dedicated to cultural educational and political affairs

delta plans to add more than 300 planes to its active fleet of 
396 planes hollis l harris told a travel industry conference

number of air passengers will increase to 761 million annually from 
455 million in 1988 
harris said the eastern airlines strike has helped atlantabased 
delta but has had a mixed effect on the airline industry

an oil company executive said monday the 
exxon valdez oil spill was the catalyst for gasoline price 
increases around the country that would have occurred anyway by 
midsummer 
with worldwide oil production down and crude oil prices up since 
november gasoline prices in the united states were bound to go up 
said tom burns manager of the economic department of chevron usa 
since the first of the year retail markets had been resisting 
upward pressure on gasoline prices burns said 
however he said the massive uncertainty surrounding the 
continued flow of oil from alaska after the exxon valdez ran 
aground march 24 in prince william sound opened the way for price 
increases 
burns was one of several oil executives who attended a meeting 
of top justice officials from seven states and representatives of 
chevron and mobil oil called by oregon attorney general dave 
frohnmayer 
earlier monday an economist said the loss of the oil from the 
exxon valdez could not be blamed for rising gasoline prices because 
west cost refineries kept up production despite a brief drop in 
crude oil shipments from alaska 
it did not have the impact in the production of gasoline 
keith leffler of the university of washington said 
leffler said his research indicated gasoline price increases 
were linked to rising refinery margins or increases in the 
difference between the prices refineries pay for crude oil and the 
prices they charge for finished products 
other oil companies were invited to the meeting shell oil 
atlanticrichfield and exxon whose exxon valdez tanker caused the 
spill agreed to private meetings later in the week at frohnmayers 
office in salem 
attorneys general from washington oregon idaho and north 
dakota attended the meeting along with top deputy attorneys 
general from california alaska and indiana 
the meeting preceded the summer driving season which begins 
this weekend 
leffler was hired by oregon and other western states to analyze 
gasoline price increases after prices shot up between midmarch and 
midapril by an average of 201 cents in portland 169 cents in 
seattle and 186 cents in boise idaho 
the tanker spilled 109 million gallons of crude oil and 
restrictions imposed by the us coast guard curtailed shipments of 
alaskan crude oil for nearly two weeks afterwards 
however leffler said despite the loss or late delivery of 
546 million gallons of crude gasoline production remained steady 
with only a slight dip in the week after the accident 
the economist said crude oil prices and retail gasoline prices 
both jumped right after the accident uncertainty over how the 
spill would affect supplies of crude oil probably was behind the 
increases leffler said 
crude oil prices then dropped as the international oil market 
adjusted to the dip in alaskan supplies leffler said dealer 
margins up right after the spill also dropped but the price of 
gasoline kept going up he said 
what went up and did not come back down were the refinery 
margins leffler said 
in the midst of massive uncertainty over whether gasoline 
supplies would fall leffler said refineries were able to increase 
their margins 
you and i see that reflected in the price we pay at the 
pump he said 
leffler told the state officials that he was unable to say 
whether the refinery margins which still were going up six weeks 
after the spill were justified
