the evangelical lutheran church in america says 
that none of three seminarians who publicly declared their 
homosexuality last year will be recommended for ordination in the 
53 millionmember denomination 
it said two of them jim lascaster of westminster calif and 
joel working of walcott nd were ruled out because they would 
not pledge compliance with a policy allowing only nonpracticing 
homosexuals to be ordained 
the third jeff johnson of lancaster calif was excluded after 
he told his bishop he would comply with the celibacy requirement 
and would resign if that situation changed 
bishop lyle miller of san francisco said that johnsons 
statement of compliance was conditional and temporary and 
therefore not consistent with the spirit of the abstinence 
requirement 
miller said johnson is a person of honesty and christian 
faith but differences between his position and church policy 
were too significant to allow for recommendation

a leftist group said today that three 
members who were organizing protests against us military bases 
disappeared in what it charged was a military plot to stifle 
dissent 
zenaida uy secretarygeneral of the new patriotic alliance 
said josemarie enriquez left his home in quezon city on wednesday 
to visit a shopping mall but never returned 
ms uy said alejandrino sarile left a meeting in suburban makati 
to change clothes but never reached his home 
the third benedicto clotario was dropped off in makati last 
sunday after attending a meeting in cavite province and has not 
been seen since she said 
she said checks of hospitals morgues and police stations failed 
to turn up any trace of the three 
we believe that these incidents are part of a systematic 
national campaign of terror being waged by the military or 
paramilitary groups as part of a national policy of repression and 
violence against organized groups the alliance said in a 
statement 
it said the abductions were an attempt to prevent rallies 
protesting the government of president corazon aquino 
because public opinion is snowballing against the aquino 
governments subservient and mendicant conduct in the bases review 
talks the present regime wants to paralyze resisting organizations 
in their campaign machinery so that they can easily force the 
decision to extend the bases stay on the philippines and subvert 
the will of the people the statement said 
last september the alliances national chairman lean 
alejandro was slain and his killers remain unknown leftists have 
accused rightwing groups of mounting a liquidation campaign 
against members of legal leftwing organizations 
in july the american bar association expressed concern in a 
letter to mrs aquino over recent killings of human rights lawyers 
who also were alliance members 
meanwhile the united states and the philippines today continued 
talks on the status of the six bases they broke down july 26 
because of differences over compensation but resumed on tuesday 
on wednesday foreign secretary raul manglapus said the 
philippines would welcome the inclusion of debt relief as part of 
the compensation package the united states has to pay for the use 
of its bases here 
the united states gives the philippines 180 million in military 
and economic aid each year in exchange for the use of clark air 
base the subic bay naval base and four smaller facilities here 
the talks are part of negotiations that began four months ago to 
review a 1947 agreement giving the americans the right to operate 
military bases in the philippines

surprising the judge and prosecutors a 
man decided at the last moment to plead guilty to firstdegree 
murder in the death of a former boarder whose decomposing head was 
found buried in his backyard 
after the plea wednesday jackson county circuit judge alvin c 
randall sentenced robert berdella to life in prison without 
probation or parole for the august 1987 murder of larry w pearson 
20 of wichita kan 
berdella 39 a kansas city flea market merchant has been in 
custody since april on sex charges after another man told police he 
had been held captive and tortured at berdellas home 
the guilty plea which came after a latemorning recess in an 
arraignment hearing on the murder charge filed july 21 appeared to 
surprise the judge who stared at one of berdellas attorneys 
assistant county public defender pat berrigan 
pat hall the assistant prosecutor assigned to the case also 
wore a stunned expression after a pause the judge insisted that 
berdella confess under oath 
i put a plastic bag over his head and tied it with rope and 
allowed him to suffocate berdella said when questioned by one of 
his attorneys asked if he did it deliberately berdella answered 
yes 
a second skull found in berdellas bedroom closet has been 
identified as that of robert a sheldon a 23yearold california 
man no charges have been brought in connection with sheldon 
analysis of pearsons skull showed that the fifth vertebra from 
just above the base of his neck had been cut several times by a 
saw the cuts were made while the deceased was still alive or 
shortly after death according to court documents 
police seized two circular saws a hacksaw a miter saw a 
disassembled jigsaw 14 jigsaw blades knives scissors and 
clippers from berdellas house according to search warrants 
jackson county prosecutor albert riederer said later that 
berdellas guilty plea was not a total surprise in the sense 
that we talked about it several weeks ago riederer said the 
discussions were with other prosecuting attorneys not berdellas 
attorneys 
barbara schenkenberg one of berdellas attorneys said berdella 
had been considering the guilty plea since he was first charged 
police went through berdellas house finding more than 200 
sexually explicit photographs and dug up his back yard in an 
extensive search 
hall said the guilty plea was in the best interest of our 
client the people of the state of missouri 
berdella was also charged with seven counts of forcible sodomy 
one of felonious restrain and one of assault in the case of the man 
who accused of him of torture

a plo official says the organization is 
still trying to sort out the significance of king husseins 
decision to sever legal ties with the west bank but is treating the 
move as a positive step 
but the official expressed skepticism about the jordanian 
monarchs intention saying the king might be trying to pressure 
palestinians in the israelioccupied territory into reliance on 
jordan 
we are dealing with it on the basis it is a positive step on 
the part of jordan the senior plo official who insisted he not 
be identified further said wednesday 
also we are dealing with it on the basis of removing from our 
minds the jordanian intentions behind this step whether it is 
pressure or not he added echoing doubts expressed by other plo 
officials meeting in baghdad 
the official indicated jordans action might prompt new plo 
diplomatic activity he said it has accelerated palestinian 
thinking regarding realistic political initiatives but declined 
to specify what steps might be taken 
hussein announced sunday he was severing administrative and 
legal ties with the west bank which his family ruled from 1948 
until israel seized it in 1967 he said he is stepping aside in 
favor of the plo and called for an independent palestinian state 
in keeping with that decision the jordanian government today 
announced it was laying off or retiring as of aug 16 more than 
21000 jordanian employees of palestinian origin working in the 
west bank 
the plo official attributed husseins decision to cut ties to 
the 8monthold uprising during which jordanian institutions in 
the occupied territories were rendered valueless 
jordan is the primary financial avenue for the 800000 west bank 
palestinians most hold jordanian passports and many receive 
jordanian salaries 
a plo communique issued here after several days of talks by the 
plo central council said the 66 members on hand discussed jordans 
action which was taken without any consulation with the 
organization 
it urged the cabinetlike executive committee to study all the 
aspects and the expected results of the jordanian measures and to 
take all necessary measures 
it neither praised nor criticized jordans action 
the senior plo official said husseins action canceled the 
jordanian option advocated by some american and israeli officials 
who favor returning the west bank to jordan in exchange for peace 
rather than allowing a palestinian state 
it put the americans and the israelis facetoface with the 
palestinians the plo official said 
he also said it should lead to a renewed plo agreement with 
jordan because we are still committed to the idea of a 
confederation between a jordanian and palestinian state 
the central council called for an extraordinary session of the 
palestine national council to discuss the jordanian action as well 
as the palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
the national council is the plos parliament 
a plo delegation will visit jordan soon to discuss the issue and 
prepare for a visit by plo chairman yasser arafat whose relations 
with jordan have been strained since hussein broke off talks with 
him in mid1986

a judge sentenced a former state highway 
patrolman to 25 years to life in prison for strangling a motorist 
and throwing her body off a 65foothigh bridge while on duty 
in handing craid peyer 38 the maximum sentence wednesday 
superior court judge richard huffman said the former patrolman 
violated societys trust but added the california highway patrol 
bears some blame for this tragedy 
huffman noted that the agency received a complaint about a month 
before the dec 27 1986 death of cara knott 20 that could have 
tipped them off to peyers habit of pulling young women over at a 
dark isolated interstate 15 exit ramp 
whether or not mr peyer would have remained a highway 
patrolman after that is another issue but what is true is that 
cara knott would be alive and craig peyer would not be on his way 
to state prison the judge said 
peyers conviction is being appealed defense attorneys said 
the 13year patrol member was the second officer in the agencys 
58year history to be convicted in the onduty slaying of a 
motorist 
peyer was convicted june 22 of firstdegree murder in his second 
trial his first trial ended in february when the jury deadlocked 
75 in favor of conviction 
huffman issued the sentence which included a 1000 fine after 
hearing impassioned pleas from the families of the victim and the 
defendant 
my husband was a friendly vibrant wellloved person and 
in my heart and in my familys heart we all know that you have the 
wrong man peyers wife karen told the court as her husband 
sobbed 
samuel knott the victims father was unmoved 
it is our fervent hope that this predator will never walk the 
streets again the punishment must be the maximum the law will 
allow he said 
huffman denied a defense request for bail pending an appeal 
saying he was a threat to the community peyer was remanded to the 
custody of sheriffs deputies for eventual transfer to state prison 
he could be eligible for parole in 17 years 8 months deputy 
district attorney paul pfingst said

michael dukakis longtime physician today said 
rumors that the democratic presidential nominee had received 
psychiatric counseling have no basis in fact and were 
politically motivated 
dr gerald r plotkin was marched out late wednesday and 
appeared on two television networks this morning to discount rumors 
about dukakis medical past that were brought into full focus with 
a gaffe by president reagan earlier wednesday 
he has never had any psychological symptoms or problems and he 
has never had any treatment for such plotkin said on cbstvs 
this morning 
plotkin said on nbctvs today show that dukakis is 
usually feeling well upbeat and very vigorous 
i would have to assume that the rumors are political he 
said i dont know whether the term is dirty tricks but i think 
certainly the allegations have no basis in fact 
on wednesday plotkin said dukakis showed no signs of clinical 
depression after two incidents that supposedly caused him to 
stumble psychologically his loss in the 1978 gubernatorial 
primary and the 1973 death of his brother stelian in a hitandrun 
accident stelian had undergone psychiatric treatment for years 
after a suicide attempt 
there is a normal grieving after any loss from minor to 
major and the response usually is in relation to the gravity of 
the loss plotkin said i was struck at the time of both losses 
at his strength rather then his depression 
im a very healthy guy dukakis told reporters earlier i 
think it was the greeks who said a sound body and a sound mind is 
what one needs especially if one is running for president 
dukakis was heading to mississippi today to begin a campaign 
trip that also included stops in california washington and 
colorado 
dukakis and plotkin were responding to rumors that had been 
spread during the democratic national convention by supporters of 
political extremist lyndon larouche and reported in a few 
newspapers in recent days 
the questions intensified after reagan referred to dukakis as an 
invalid when asked wednesday morning whether he thought dukakis 
should release his medical records the question was posed by a 
reporter for the executive intelligence review a larouche 
publication 
the president apologized a few minutes later and said he was 
attempting a joke 
dukakis was graceful when asked about reagans remarks 
no apology was really needed dukakis said we all 
occasionally misspeak and i dont think the president needed to 
apologize 
his wife kitty was less kind 
mrs dukakis campaigning in new jersey said such remarks come 
when people are desperate and afraid of dealing with the real 
issues 
plotkin released a threepage statement he said summarized all 
treatment he has given dukakis over the past 17 years at the 
harvard community health plan a health maintenance organization 
whose services are available through the state employees benefits 
program prior to that dukakis was treated by his father a family 
doctor 
plotkin said he has treated dukakis for 
plantar fascitis a form of minor foot discomfort associated 
with jogging in 1983 he since has given up jogging but keeps an 
almost daily regimen of speed walking 
a pinched nerve in his neck in 1979 
a pulled achilles tendon in 1976 
the prescribed treatment for those conditions was rest heat and 
naproxen an antiinflammatory medicine slightly more powerful than 
aspirin plotkin said 
the doctor said dukakis also was treated for 
a minor fracture of his collarbone suffered in a foot race in 
ireland in 1976 dukakis was treated in ireland and saw plotkin for 
a followup xray 
a splinter under the nail of his left index finger in 1979 
hoarseness in 1981 which was attributed to his teaching at 
the john f kennedy school of government 
a cyst on his back in 1986 which was drained 
plotkin said the material he had released was essentially that 
contained in his file on dukakis with the exception of personal 
notes those notes contain no reference to any possible 
psychological ailment he said adding that he has never expressed 
any concern about dukakis health to another doctor 
plotkin said dukakis could have been treated by another doctor 
but that he considered the prospect highly unlikely 
vice president george bush also has released details on his 
medical background but no actual medical records the certain 
republican nominee disclosed i have mild arthritis in the hips 
which is nonlimiting and an allergy to bee stings for which he 
receives shots 
some of the talk and actions wednesday recalled the 1972 
presidential race when sen thomas eagleton of missouri was forced 
off the democratic ticket following disclosure that the vice 
presidential nominee had undergone shock therapy for mental 
depression

the nation would save money at the same time 
it saves its children by redirecting resources to health care for 
pregnant women and their newborn infants a federal commission said 
today 
we spend vast amounts on a compassionate effort to save sick 
children when we could spend far less to assure they are born 
healthy said a report of the national commission to prevent 
infant mortality 
sen lawton chiles dfla chairman of the panel which was 
created by congress in july 1987 was presenting the final report 
today during an appearance at the national press club 
no nation can long call itself great that does not put its 
children first chiles said in a letter accompanying the report 
to that end our commission report is a hammer on the anvil of 
public commitment and we want the echoes to spread throughout the 
country 
the report says 40000 infants die each year in the united 
states before they reach their first birthday and that without 
changes in the next 13 years we will lose more american infants 
than we have lost soldiers in all the wars fought by the nation in 
this century 
these facts would be sad enough were it not for the additional 
fact that at least half of the deaths are preventable it said 
chiles discussing the report on abctvs good morning 
america before its formal release said that those who suffer 
the most are the poor and thats true whether theyre white poor 
in appalachia or theyre black poor 
a child born in the united states has a poorer chance of 
surviving his or her first year than one born in 19 other 
industrialized nations the report said 
chiles said in the interview that a child born in hong kong or 
singapore would have a better chance of reaching its first 
birthday than one born in the united states 
the report did not cite any source for this information and 
various groups that compile such figures have differed in where the 
united states ranks the childrens defense fund a childrens 
advocacy agency reported in 1987 that the united states had 
slipped to last place among 20 industrialized nations with 11 out 
of every 1000 children born dying before they reach their first 
birthday 
however unicef reported earlier this year that the us rate of 
106 per 1000 live births put the united states in the 18th rank 
out of 36 industrialized nations 
the commission recommends a national campaign to emphasize 
infant mortality and says a permanent national council on 
childrens health should be established 
it is time we made a visible tangible commitment to our 
childrens health to their quality of life and to our nations 
future because it is cost effective and more importantly 
because it is right the report said 
while not losing site of the moral commitment a society owes its 
young the report emphasizes in several places the sheer financial 
prudence of spending on prenatal care 
every low birthweight birth that could be averted would save 
the us health care system between 14000 and 30000 it said 
the lifetime custodial costs for a low birthweight infant can 
reach 400000 it continued the cost of prenatal care care 
that might prevent low birthweight condition in the first place 
can be as little as 400 
the report makes two fundamental recommendations 
we must provide universal access to early maternity and 
pediatric care for all mothers and infants employers must make 
available health insurance coverage that includes maternity and 
wellbaby care government must assume responsibility for those who 
lack private insurance or are unable to pay 
chiles in the television interview commented that all 
elderly people in this country regardless of their status 
have medical care we have not said that about pregnant women we 
have not said that about our children 
we must initiate immediately a sustained broadbased effort 
to make the health and wellbeing of mothers and infants a national 
priority and give them public attention and resources they 
deserve 
the panel recommended that congress raise appropriations for six 
separate programs that would benefit pregnant women and their 
newborn children such as the supplemental food program for women 
infants and children and the child immunization program but it 
gave no figures

the top soviet arms control negotiator today said 
his nation and the united states have made modest progress toward 
an agreement on reducing longrange nuclear weapons since the 
moscow summit in june 
but the negotiator alexei obukhov also told the 40nation 
geneva conference on disarmament that there is a great amount of 
work that yet has to be done to resolve outstanding issues 
the arms control negotiators returned to geneva on july 12 to 
resume talks on a treaty to reduce longrange or strategic 
nuclear forces by 50 percent they are also working on a document 
governing defense and space issues 
obukhov said the very first weeks of the current negotiating 
round have already seen certain progress one has to be 
selfcritical however the progress achieved is very modest 
he said the soviet side has introduced a whole range of 
proposals at the talks during the past three weeks and is waiting 
for a us response 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
us side also has been offering proposals during the talks what 
both delegations are engaged in is seeing how progress at the 
moscow summit can be reflected here in specific treaty language 
he told the associated press 
obukhov said one main issue at the arms talks is compliance with 
the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty and he indicated that the 
us strategic defense initiative program or sdi remains an 
obstacle 
obukhov reaffirmed the soviet position that a strategic arms 
treaty or start should be linked to an agreement assuring that 
development and deployment of strategic defenses such as sdi does 
not violate the abm treaty 
he reiterated the soviet position that a broad interpretation of 
the abm treaty which the reagan administration says would permit 
sdi development was not feasible 
another outstanding issue obukhov said is limitations on 
submarinelaunched cruise missiles which the soviets want included 
in the treaty the us opposes including such weapons in the 
treaty because it says it would be too difficult to prevent 
cheating 
obukhov said the two sides are working on four joint draft texts 
at the start talks the treaty a memorandum of understanding a 
protocol on inspection and a protocol on conversion and 
elimination of systems 
in december president reagan and mikhail s gorbachev signed a 
treaty eliminating all intermediaterange nuclear weapons the pact 
was ratified by both countries before the two leaders held the 
moscow summit in june

in the persian gulf today iranian gunboats fired at a norwegian 
tanker after it refused to stop for an inspection gulfbased

the ship but caused no injuries 
earlier reports from irans official islamic republic news 
agency said 1031 civilians were injured in an iraqi chemical bomb 
attack tuesday in the town of oshnaviyeh in the northern province 
of west azerbaijan 
today irna raised the injury toll to 1700 
over 100 of the victims mainly women and children have 
reportedly been seriously affected and are being treated in various 
hospitals in the province irna said 
iraq denied it dropped chemical bombs on the area according to 
the official iraqi news agency 
on wednesday iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati lodged 
a formal protest with the security council over the alleged 
chemical attack and said it should impose sanctions on iraq 
a report released monday by a un team concluded that iraq has 
made repeated and extensive use of chemical warfare in the war 
violating international law iraq claims iran used chemical weapons 
first 
it also found that nine iraqi soldiers were poisoned recently by 
chemical weapons but left open the question of whether iran was to 
blame 
velayati was in new york to represent iran at unsponsored 
talks aimed at ending the 8yearold war iran said july 18 it 
would accept a yearold security council ceasefire resolution 
iraq which said it would accept the resolution soon after it 
passed insists on direct talks with iran before a ceasefire iran 
wants a ceasefire before direct talks 
lt gen martin vadset of norway head of a un ceasefire

apart from some bullet holes near the bridge weve got no 
damage at all the captain leif klausen told the norwegian ntb 
news agency 
six fast gunboats approached us and asked us to stop for 
inspection when i refused because the boats had no markings one 
boat opened machinegun fire he was quoted as saying in a 
telephone interview 
the tanker was headed to rotterdam from saudi arabia with a load 
of crude 
the berge lord attacked previously this year did not stop and 
proceeded with its voyage southward the sources said 
us navy sources said the missile cruiser uss halsey responded 
to the tankers distress calls but when it checked if assistance 
was required the captain of the berge lord declined and kept 
sailing 
it was the first hostile incident involving a neutral ship in 
the gulf since iran announced it would accept a ceasefire iranian 
gunboats last attacked a tanker on july 15 
sources said iran was exercising the right under international 
maritime law for nations at war to stop and inspect ships anywhere 
at sea to check for cargo bound for their enemy 
iran says it has stopped thousands of ships for inspections and 
shipping executives say the iranians occasionally fire warning 
shots

a senior communist party official said 
590 conscientious objectors have refused to do compulsory 18month 
military service in hungary since 1977 a newspaper said today 
it was believed to be the first such public admission regarding 
conscientious objectors by a hungarian official 
ferenc szombathelyi deputy head of department in the partys 
central committee told the party daily nepszabadsag that 40 to 45 
young people were jailed annually 
this practice must be changed now he said 
he said that compulsory work in health and social 
institutions communal establishments and major investment 
projects might be suitable alternatives to military service 
the issue of conscientious objectors has been under debate in 
hungary with church officials and dissidents demanding that 
authorities change draft provisions 
in june at least 700 people signed a petition for introduction 
of an alternative to military service that was presented to 
parliament 
people who refuse to do mandatory military service in hungary 
for reasons of conscience or religion can be imprisoned for up to 
five years 
however jehovas witnesses members of the church of the 
nazarene and seventhday adventists are exempted from military 
service 
a conscript serves 18 months in the armed forces and it is 
conceivable that those doing civilian work instead would serve a 
longer term szombathelyi said 
the cases would be examined individually and meticulously 
and on no account should exemption be granted to clever guys 
or irresponsible persons the official said without elaboration 
in june poland became the first east bloc country to establish 
an alternative civilian service

an 87yearold man found dead in a park 
may have tried to relive his escape from a world war ii prison 
camp by fleeing a nursing home during a fire drill his doctor says 
josef fruewirth was found wednesday a halfmile from hot springs 
nursing home which he left on june 30 said his physician william 
r mashburn who is also the garland county coroner 
during world war ii fruewirth tunneled out of a soviet prison 
camp and walked 625 miles to his native austria where he was 
reunited with his family mashburn said 
fruewirth died of exposure complicated by lack of medication for 
heart disease and probably did not survive 24 hours after leaving 
the home mashburn said the threepackperday smoker also had 
emphysema and signs of early alzheimers disease the coroner said 
the bell ringing and confusion may have caused a flashback to 
a time in his life when he was a prisoner he was very unhappy in 
the nursing home he felt to a degree incarcerated mashburn 
said this drill was evidently what he had been waiting for i 
truly believe the clanging and people being pushed out well he 
escaped once and i think he tried to do so again 
he had amazing stamina said becky ponder a registered 
nurse at the home anyone who would walk over 600 miles to get 
back to his family is capable of anything 
his body was found in the rugged mountainous terrain of hot 
springs national park which begins near the nursing home 
we found him within a few feet of a beautiful little spring 
you wouldnt find a more peaceful place to go to god mashburn

the head of the naacp is calling on district 
of columbia mayor marion barry to overrule the citys legal counsel 
and drop weapons charges against newspaper columnist carl rowan 
but a spokesman for the mayor says barry doesnt have the 
authority or the inclination to ask that the charges be dropped 
carl rowan is not and never has been a lawbreaker 
benjamin hooks executive director of the civil rights group said 
in a statement wednesday to the contrary he has spent 40 years 
as a distinguished journalist trying to force presidents 
governors congress and others to obey the constitution to enforce 
decent laws so that black people might be free 
last week the citys corporation counsel frederick cooke filed 
charges of possession of an unregistered weapon and ammunition 
against rowan in connection with the shooting of a teenager in the 
columnists back yard 
john white a spokesman for barry said the mayor had not yet 
seen the letter but didnt plan to ask cooke to drop the charges 
the mayor does not have the authority said white it is 
the feeling of this office that perhaps mr hooks has not read the 
dc law under the city charter the corporation counsel is the 
chief legal officer of the city 
hooks told the washington post that every executive must 
occasionally correct staff members mistakes 
people in my office quite often do things that i overrule 
because its not in the best interest of my organization in the 
long run to do that he said and thats what im asking marion 
barry to overrule a mistake made by his corporation counsel 
but white said its the mayors policy not to interfere with 
the corporation counsels decisions he feels that where would it 
stop if he started telling the corporation counsel when or when not 
to press charges 
benjamin smith 18 of chevy chase md had scaled rowans 
eightfoot fence with at least one friend on june 14 to take a 
latenight dip in the columnists pool rowan told police he shot 
the youth in the hand with a 22caliber revolver because he 
thought the teen was lunging toward him 
investigators discovered that the gun which had been given to 
rowan by his son a former fbi agent was not properly registered 
with the city

finding ways to beat this summers record heat 
the stuyvesant town apartment complex in manhattan is home to 
18000 middleincome tenants many of whom could pay the price for 
cooling units

complex was built 40 years ago for returning world war ii 
servicemen 
metropolitan life insurance co which owns the complex says 
the aging wiring couldnt safely support thousands of air 
conditioners

in grocery stores 
others have four or eight fans going at the same time setting 
them up at strategic angles to get the best breeze possible

jordan today said it was dismissing within 
two weeks all 21200 palestinian civil servants working at 
jordanian institutions in the israelioccupied territories 
in israel a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
the move will only hurt palestinians living in the west bank and 
gaza strip 
the decision announced by staterun radio jordan followed king 
husseins announcement sunday that he was severing administrative 
ties with the west bank to give more responsibility to the 
palestine liberation organization 
the announcement was carried by the radio following a cabinet 
meeting headed by prime minister zaid rifai 
the decision is in accordance with the kingdoms decision to 
cut legal and administrative links with palestinians in the 
occupied lands the radio said 
all jordanian citizens working for official and government 
agencies will be retired as of aug 16 the radio said 
the radio said civil servants who have worked less than 15 years 
will be dismissed with a months salary for every year of service 
a jordanian official said 16000 of the civil servants fall into 
this category 
the official said responsibility for those 16000 will lie with 
the plo 
those who have worked more than 15 years also will be dismissed 
but they will continue to receive their monthly salaries from 
jordan until they retire on a pension after 20 years have elapsed 
since they began working the report said the official said 5200 
civil servants fall into this category 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip 
from egypt during the 1967 middle east war since december 
palestinians in the occupied lands have been waging an uprising 
against israeli occupation in which more than 235 palestinians and 
four israelis have been killed the uprising has been directed by 
underground leaders linked to the plo which also provides funding 
even after jordan lost control of the west bank it continued to 
pay its employees there and run the schools as well as other 
administrative offices about 850000 palestinians live in the west 
bank 
one palestinian affected by the decision 55yearold jamila 
azmi of bethlehem who has worked 30 years as a school principal 
said 
i dont think it is fair who is going to take care of the 
fired employees the only alternative is to work in israel i wish 
they had thought before they made the decision 
in israel a spokesman quoted shamir as saying that jordans 
dismissal of the palestinian employees will only hurt palestinians 
in the occupied lands because they will have to live with less 
money 
the decision also terminates the services of an unspecified 
number of workers at private institutions and companies linked to 
the government who will receive severance pay according to their 
employers rules the radio said 
those working for courts and the authority that controls mosques 
and other religious institution are exempt from the measures the 
announcement said 
on saturday the king dissolved the lower house of the jordanian 
parliament where 30 of the 60 members came from the west bank 
late last month he also canceled a 13 billion development 
program for education and economic projects in the west bank 
about 110000 palestinians are employed in israel but about 
onequarter of them have frequently missed work during the uprising

american samoas nonvoting delegate to 
congress in an effort to avoid further shame pleaded guilty 
to a charge he participated in a 130920 payroll padding scheme 
his lawyer says 
defense lawyer earl silbert told us district judge stanley 
harris on wednesday that del fofo if sunia stood a reasonable 
chance of acquittal if the case went to trial 
but silbert said that sunia a democrat who has represented 
samoa since 1981 was pleading guilty to a single charge of 
conspiracy to defraud the government to avoid further shame to 
himself and his people 
sunia insists that he did not participate in the conspiracy from 
its inception in early 1983 but later became aware that his chief 
aide matthew iuli had arranged for paychecks to be issued to 
people who were not working for the congressman silbert said 
iuli also pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge as well as a 
second count of filing a false payroll document 
silbert told harris that sunia will resign from the house where 
he can vote only in committees before his oct 4 sentencing 
the lawmaker declined to comment on his guilty plea or say when 
he would resign sunia 51 could receive a fiveyear sentence and 
a 250000 fine 
assistant us attorney robert andary revealed in court that 
iuli began cooperating with federal investigators 18 months ago 
even though he remains on sunias payroll to this day 
sunia was aware of iulis cooperation with the secret service 
agents who were investigating the case according to sources 
familiar with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity 
by way of some explanation silbert said the cultural background 
of sunia and iuli plus their extraordinarily passive 
personalities combined to make one of the strangest cases ive 
ever encountered 
the defense lawyer told the judge that sunia did not profit from 
the scheme 
but andary disputed that contention saying the lawmaker used 
39112 for personal expenses including payments on a house and a 
car 
silbert said the money was used mostly to pay the hotel bills 
and restaurant tabs of visiting constituents samoan hospitality 
that was expected from sunia 
investigators were tipped to the scheme in late 1985 when a 
former member of sunias staff roger hazell complained that his 
w2 tax form showed he had earned an extra 1995 
secret service agents determined the paycheck had been deposited 
in a joint checking account held by sunia and iuli 
a large number of payroll checks ended up in the account or 
another for the committee to reelect fofo andary said 
none of the samoans named as payees worked for sunia and told 
investigators they were unaware their names were on the 
congressmans payroll andary said 
the prosecutor said iuli conceived the scheme in early 1983 
after the congressmans staff was doubled from nine to 18 members 
iuli determined that there was not enough work for 18 people but 
the office would lose any money he didnt spend to hire extra 
people andary said 
so he placed phony names on the payroll to get the money to 
defray some of the costs of running the office andary said 
iuli also used some of the money to reimburse himself for 
expenses he had paid out of his own pocket andary said 
iulis sentencing was scheduled for oct 3 he could receive two 
fiveyear terms but prosecutors agreed not to seek the maximum 
sentence against him 
in return for sunias guilty plea prosecutors agreed not to 
prosecute him for forgery and false statements including false 
reports to the federal election commission 
both men agreed to make restitution of undisclosed amounts of 
money

michael dukakis campaigned in the south today talking of civil 
rights while his doctor and prominent democrats suggested 
political motives for rumors that dukakis had been treated for 
psychological problems dukakis and the doctor said the rumors were 
false 
republican george bush was headed to corpus christi texas to 
deliver a speech in which aides said he would highlight his 
differences with dukakis on defense bush had no comment on the 
dukakishealth story saying he wouldnt be dragged into the 
minicontroversy 
gerald r plotkin dukakis physician for the past 17 years 
said today i would have to assume that the rumors are political 
i dont know whether the term is dirty tricks but i think 
certainly the allegations have no basis in fact 
new york gov mario cuomo said today i think theres 
something significant about what the republicans have done here 
the fact that they would use lyndon larouche to get this thing 
started the fact that they would get negative that they would get 
to irrelevant so early 
the rumors began spreading at the democratic national convention 
in atlanta two weeks ago when supporters of larouche a political 
extremist and fringe presidential candidate distributed fliers 
suggesting dukakis was unstable the issue burst into public view 
wednesday after president reagan called dukakis an invalid in 
answer to a question at the white house from a reporter from a 
laroucheconnected publication 
former arizona gov bruce babbitt who was defeated by dukakis 
in the democratic primaries said today that hed first noted the 
rumors from the fliers in atlanta 
plotkin commented on cbstv and nbctv cuomo and babbitt on cbs 
dukakis trying to leave the subject behind flew to 
philadelphia miss 
here in mississippi you know the importance of equal rights 
and civil rights dukakis said in remarks prepared for the 
neshoba county fair the same rural gathering where ronald reagan 
kicked off his campaign as the republican presidential nominee in 
1980 
and today i say to all americans east west north and 
south let us work together let us work together to bring down 
the barriers to opportunity for all our people dukakis said 
let us work together to see that every citizen and every child 
born in this country is an equal shareholder in the american 
dream he said 
a day earlier back in washington reagan was asked whether 
dukakis should release his medical records 
reagan quipped that he didnt want to pick on an invalid a 
reference to dukakis that he later retracted as a bad joke hours 
later dukakis personal physician released a summary of their 
17year relationship as patient and doctor 
he has had no significant illnesses during his lifetime and 
has been in excellent health plotkin said at a news conference 
called by the dukakis campaign 
he has had no psychological symptoms complaints or 
treatment plotkin said 
the threepage summary listed minor ailments breaks bumps and 
bruises such as a pinched neck nerve pulled achilles tendon 
hoarseness from lecturing and a cyst on his back 
questions about dukakis mental health centered on his loss in 
the 1978 gubernatorial primary and the 1973 death of his brother 
stelian in a hitandrun accident stelian had undergone 
psychiatric treatment for years after a suicide attempt 
i was struck at the time of both losses at his strength rather 
then his depression plotkin said describing dukakis reaction 
dukakis had a less detailed summary saying im a very 
healthy guy 
bush meanwhile refused to comment on the dukakis medical 
records question referring to it as a minicontroversy he did 
say he would release his own records 
the certain republican nominee continued his weeklong effort to 
show up dukakis as weak and inexperienced on defense and foreign 
affairs the speech today before the gi forum was the second 
foreign policy address by bush this week 
there will be more references to the bush foreign policy as it 
compares to the more liberal democratic approach that comes from 
the dukakis forces said bushs chief of staff craig fuller 
bush toured a defense plant in annapolis md on wednesday and 
took time to stand squarely behind the president on his veto of a 
2995 billion defense bill 
bush said reagan had made a tough call the right call in 
vetoing the defense authorization bill which would slash funds for 
the strategic defense initiative the dukakis campaign describes 
the administrations proposed spacebased defense system as 
fantasy 
bush was less firmly behind his boss on the recommendations of 
the presidential commission on aids bush said he essentially 
agreed with the recommendations including a call for legislation 
banning discrimination against victims of the deadly disease 
earlier this week reagan voiced opposition to most of the 
panels central recommendations 
people are scared bush said if there is a risk of 
discrimination people who have aids arent going to come forward 
to be tested and have their disease evaluated 
bush later also called upon the food and drug administration to 
do what it could to speed decisions that could make drugs for aids 
more quickly available

there you go again mr president 
ronald reagan the great communicator the man who is seldom at 
a loss for words has gotten himself into trouble once more with 
his glib tongue 
once he spoke into a live microphone and jested about bombing 
the soviet union 
another time he joked that he sometimes withheld information 
from congress 
now hes called democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
an invalid and then said he was only kidding and shouldnt have 
said it 
dukakis said no apology was needed his running mate sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas called the presidents remark outrageous and 
laughable vice president george bush declined to comment 
reagan is no stranger to this kind of problem 
the most recent time he said something that he immediately had 
to regret was on march 16 when he was meeting with israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir in the oval office 
a reporter asked him to comment on his former national security 
adviser robert mcfarlane pleading guilty to misdemeanor charges 
of withholding information from congress 
he just pleaded guilty to not telling congress everything it 
wanted to know said reagan ive done that myself 
as reporters left the room he told shamir oh boy just for 
that careless remark theyll go wild about reagan wants to lie to 
congress or something 
then there was the time on aug 11 1984 that the president 
was doing a voice test for his weekly radio broadcast although his 
words werent going out onto the air they were fed into the white 
house press room where reporters were preparing to cover his 
remarks 
all right my fellow americans i am pleased to tell you today 
that i have signed legislation that will outlaw russia forever we 
begin bombing in five minutes 
the president hasnt heard the last of that one yet 
it wasnt the only time he used his sound tests for some humor 
that didnt get on the air but did get reported 
once he opened up with welcome to death valley days the 
television program he used to host 
on another occasion while warming up by reading his prepared 
text for a speech about the economy he added and i am prepared

prime minister yitzhak shamir believes jordans 
move to dismiss 21200 palestinia employees in the occupied 
territories will hurt palestinians and not israel a spokesman said 
today 
jordan said today the civil servants will be dismissed by aug 
16 
the move came four days after jordan said it was abandoning 
legal and administrative links with palestinians in the occupied 
lands and handing over responsibility to the palestine liberation 
organization 
the decision dismissing the employees was criticized today by 
one west bank worker who will lost his job but it drew praise from 
a proplo newspaper editor who said the plo will fill the 
political vacuum left by jordan 
jordans decision will certainly increase the pressure on 
arabs in judea and samaria shamirs spokesman yossi ahimeir 
said using biblical names for the west bank they will have to 
live with less money 
ahimeir said it was difficult to predict how the dismissals 
would affect the 8monthold uprising in which palestinians have 
been protesting israels occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip more than 235 palestinians and four israelis have been 
killed since the uprising began dec 8 
one palestinian worker who will be dismissed 55yearold jamila 
azmi of bethlehem said i dont think it is fair who is going 
to take care of the fired employees the only alternative is to 
work in israel 
azmi who has worked as a school principal for 30 years added 
i wish they jordanian officials had thought before they made 
the decision 
before jordans announcement today underground leaders of the 
palestinian uprising praised the kingdom for severing ties with the 
west bank and called the move a major achievement of the revolt 
against israeli occupation 
the statement in leaflets distributed in the west bank and gaza 
strip was the first reaction by the proplo leadership to sundays 
announcement by king hussein that he was cutting ties with the west 
bank 
in jerusalem meanwhile us diplomats said on wednesday they 
were investigating the death of ribhi barakat kayed 67 a 
palestinianamerican who relatives said died after israeli soldiers 
prevented him from getting medication for a heart condition the 
army denied the allegations 
violent clashes erupted in two gaza strip refugee camps 
wednesday night and dozens of arabs were injured by troops 
including a 15yearold struck in the eye by a rubber bullet 
in a leaflet distributed in the occupied lands the plobacked 
united national leadership of the uprising praised husseins 
decisions 
leaflets are the main means of communications between leaders of 
the uprising and arab protesters in the occupied lands 
the announcement enforced the status of the plo as the sole 
representative of the palestinian people the leaflet said the 
underground leaders took credit for the monarchs move calling it 
one of the most important achievements of the uprising

turkey where he planned talks on turkishus defense cooperation

fire today destroyed what was to be the 
first black fraternity house at the university of mississippi 
the cause of the blaze at the vacant house was under 
investigation by the state fire marshals office said fire capt 
ronnie mills 
the 20member phi beta sigma fraternity had planned to move in 
to the twostory house later his month after winning approval to 
become the first black tenants among the approximately 16 
antebellumstyle houses on fraternity row 
there is no reason to expect any foul play at all people are 
going to make that assumption but its simply an old house and we 
dont know what happened said university spokesman ed meek 
no utilities were connected at the house and no one was 
believed inside when the fire was reported at 328 am he said 
meek said the 50yearold house had been vacant for some time 
some fraternity members who came to the house today declined to 
comment phi beta sigma chapter adviser thomas wallace of new 
albany does not have a listed telephone number and couldnt 
immediately be reached for comment 
meek said the state college board recently approved leasing the 
house to the black fraternity he said the lease hadnt been signed 
yet but fraternity members had been allowed in in the past few 
days to prepare to move in 
its a total loss theres brick walls left on the outside 
but everything else is gutted meek said 
ann cook associate commissioner of higher education for the 
state college board was among the educators who had applauded the 
prospect of a black fraternity at ole miss where riots broke out 
in 1962 when james meredith became the first black student to 
register at the school 
we feel like it just shows the new change in mississippi the 
new mississippi cook said when the lease was approved 
meek said he didnt know if there were other vacant houses on 
fraternity row that could be offered to the black fraternity he 
said the school will do its best to find other accommodations 
before the students start arriving aug 20

it will take a considerable amount of time 
to determine how to compensate families of the 290 people killed 
last month when a us navy missile destroyed a civilian iranian 
jetliner over the persian gulf reagan administration officials 
said today 
meanwhile the chairman of the house armed services committee 
rep les aspin dwis said a conclusion that human mistakes in 
the midst of combat caused the united states to shoot down the 
plane could persuade congress to approve the compensation 
pentagon sources said wednesday that preliminary findings show 
human error rather than malfunctioning equipment caused the navy 
warship vincennes to fire on the iran air jetliner july 3 
testifying before the armed services committee today abraham 
sofaer the state departments legal adviser said the 
administration will work as quickly as possible to fufill president 
reagans promise that humanitarian compensation will be paid 
but sofaer terstified 
we will need a considerable amount of time to determine how to 
assess compensation and to obtain the information necessary from 
the families or their governments 
while aiming to make tha payments promptly he said the united 
states must also satisfy all professional and legal requirements 
before making any payment including obtaining legislative 
authority if necessary or desirable 
aspin said earlier that he has not seen a report that according 
to the sources concludes there was no problem with the 
sophisticated aegis airdefense radar system on the uss vincennes 
if it turns out the united states is totally responsible and 
human error was the responsibility i think it will tilt the 
chances of congress going along with the idea of compensation 
not to the government but to the families aspin said on abctvs 
good morning america 
one pentagon official said the biggest question when this 
started was whether aegis worked properly and the inquiry has 
found no evidence of a malfunction another official said the 
inquiry determined there was no problem with the aegis 
the defense officials agreed to discuss the preliminary findings 
into the tragedy only on condition they not be identified the 
vincennes shot down the airliner shortly after it had taken off 
from a military and civilian airfield in iran all 290 passengers 
and crew aboard the plane were killed 
the sources stressed that the findings of the investigative team 
that just returned from the gulf had yet to be accepted formally or 
endorsed by military brass or defense secretary frank c 
carlucci 
but this explanation is very plausible one source said 
people underestimate the human factor and stress you cant 
replicate that in exercises and training 
the vincennes one of the navys newest and most sophisticated 
ships fired on the iranian airliner after concluding it was an 
iranian jet fighter the vincennes crew classified the approaching 
radar contact as hostile and when the plane failed to respond 
to radio warnings the ships skipper gave the order to open fire 
the classification of that radar contact as hostile appears to 
have been made by crewmen in the heat of battle without adequate 
technical justification one official said there is no evidence 
the aegis radar system malfunctioned or that it presented technical 
data to justify the hostile classification the source 
explained 
perhaps understandably there was misinterpretation 
another official said 
the ship was on high alert iranian fighters had been detected 
operating from the same airfield in iran just a short time earlier 
and the vincennes had just survived its first combat action in the 
gulf a fight with three iranian gunboats 
very quickly almost upon takeoff the plane was classified as 
hostile a source said 
here you had a bunch of people believing that the inbound was 
hostile and thought to be a threat the official said so here 
youve got a mindset 
and youve got something a contact that obviously was not 
responding to warnings which further suggests that it might be 
hostile its not as simple as just saying human error they didnt 
purposely shoot down an airliner 
the pentagon refused to discuss the matter wednesday saying the 
findings were still being reviewed by gen george b crist the 
head of the us central command and had yet to be forwarded to 
washington 
crist must decide whether to accept the findings of his 
investigative team which was led by rear adm william fogarty the 
pentagon noted 
president reagan in a brief questionandanswer exchange with 
reporters also declined to comment on the matter 
i have read and heard and seen what is being said about the 
report and assigning the blame to the people in the radar room 
interpreting the signals and all the president said 
i cant comment because neither the military nor my office has 
received the report reagan said 
the sources said wednesday the written report and documentary 
evidence were still in crists hands but that a few defense 
officials including carlucci had received oral briefings on the 
status of the work 
the new york times in a report wednesday said it appeared the 
vincennes crew mistook an electronic identification signal from a 
c130 aircraft at bandar abbas to be from the passenger airliner 
the sources contacted by the associated press declined comment 
on that aspect of the inquiry and also refused to say whether 
investigators had advanced any explanation for the failure of the 
iranian airliner to respond to the vincennes radio warnings

a tropical storm watch was posted for the 
120000 residents of hawaii island as a dangerous hurricane 
fabio and its 125 mph gusts churned toward the hawaiian islands 
today forecasters said 
at 2 am today 8 am edt the storms center was 530 miles 
eastsoutheast of hilo and 740 miles eastsoutheast of honolulu 
with a course and speed that would bring it just south of hawaii 
the southernmost island in the chain on friday 
if the course and speed remained unchanged it would be near 
oahu the most populous island of 850000 where honolulu is 
located on saturday forecasters said 
maximum sustained winds were 105 mph with tropical force winds 
between 39 mph and 73 mph extending 180 miles from the center the 
intensity diminished from early wednesday when gusts reached 175 
mph 
its a large storm and quite intense said hans rosendal a 
meteorologist with the national weather service in honolulu 
it likely will come quite close to the islands it is still a 
dangerous storm 
a track up the chains western side would bring the more intense 
and dangerous side of the storm over the islands he said 
although the storm had not weakened in six hours rosendal said 
storms usually diminish in strength as they move away from the 
equator and over cooler waters 
supermarkets contacted around the state wednesday said they had 
not noticed any big rush to buy items as batteries candles 
charcoal or canned goods that civil defense officials advised 
residents to have on hand 
observers assigned to spend wednesday night on hawaii islands 
east coast to watch for rising surf generated by the approaching 
storm reported no problems said bruce butts operations officer 
for the hawaii county civil defense 
the last major storm to hit hawaii was hurricane iwa which 
skirted oahu and ran over kauai and niihau in november 1982 with 
117 mph winds causing 234 million damage there were no deaths 
officially attributed to that storm

the house voted 257156 today to approve 
legislation giving 20000 taxfree payments to thousands of 
japaneseamericans who were rounded up and sent to internment camps 
at the outbreak of world war ii 
the bill now goes to the white house where president reagan has 
said he will sign it ending a sad chapter in american history 
with the money will come an apology from the us government for 
having forced about 120000 japaneseamericans both citizens and 
resident aliens from their homes and jobs following the japanese 
attack on pearl harbor hawaii on dec 7 1941 
the payments will begin in about a year and will total about 
125 billion individual payments to the estimated 60000 
surviving internees will be made over a 10year period with the 
most elderly getting priority 
in return for the money those who qualify must agree to drop 
any legal claims against the government stemming from the 
internment 
the legislation also authorizes payments of up to 12000 each 
for surviving members of the aleut indian tribes who were removed 
from the aleutian islands during the japanese attack there in 1942 
rep norman y mineta dcalif who himself spent part of his 
youth in an internment camp in wyoming said this legislation 
touches all of us because it touches the very core of our nation 
mineta who took the speakers chair to preside over the vote 
said passage ended many years of prayers and struggles and 
dreams 
rep bill frenzel rminn an earlier opponent of the payments 
said before the vote that he had changed his mind i see this as 
an important national apology it is a time for apology and 
reunification and i intend to be a part of it 
the internment camps arose from a 1942 order by president 
franklin d roosevelt that said the war department could designate 
military areas from which people could be excluded 
later military orders resulted in the exclusion of all people of 
japanese ancestry from california washington and oregon and some 
in hawaii the orders affected 77000 us citizens and 43000 
legal and illegal resident aliens all were taken to prison camps 
in the western states 
the last camp was closed in january 1946

republican senators along with democratic contra aid supporter 
david boren met today in doles office with national security 
adviser colin powell to work out a strategy for reaching a 
bipartisan agreement on an aid package that would give wright less 
discretion over whether lethal aid will ultimately flow to the 
rebels 
there are some clear differences between the two sides 
powell said after the meeting theres always room for a 
compromise we have to have a contra aid bill before congress 
adjourns this fall 
fitzwater told reporters the democratic proposal falls far 
short humanitarian aid is too limited too narrowly defined 
to be of any real help 
drafting a bill that would win approval without giving wright 
what the republicans feel is too much power is the no 1 
question said senate gop leader bob dole of kansas 
added jesse helms rnc said if cousin jim doesnt sign on 
this thing its not worth the paper its written on 
on wednesday dole said no one elected speaker wright 
president i will not be a party to giving him a unilateral veto 
over our national security policies in central america 
the democratic proposal completed wednesday gave the party its 
first show of unity on the aid issue in seven years 
but the step goes only halfway to the goal majority leader 
robert byrd was seeking a bipartisan accord that will tell central 
america that the united states favors a peaceful solution and at 
the same time blunt the issues political impact throughout the 
fall election season 
byrd said his aid package worked out over two weeks of 
discussions with more than a dozen senate democrats would provide 
the incentives both the contras and the leftist sandinista 
government need to achieve success in their faltering peace effort 
this legislation can go either way byrd dwva told 
reporters as he announced the agreement at a news conference it 
can reward nicaragua with aid and trade for making peace and 
democratic reforms or it can provide the fuel for the contras to 
resume their war on the managua regime he said 
peace talks have been suspended in an atmosphere of growing 
tension since the last session between the two sides broke up in 
disagreement june 9 
the sandinistas have arrested opposition leaders shut down 
opposition media outlets and expelled us diplomats in recent 
weeks the contras have elected a new harderline political 
directorate and have been accused of carrying out attacks in the 
countryside in violation of an informal ceasefire 
appearing at the news conference with byrd were half a dozen 
democrats all along the spectrum on the contra aid issue from aid 
proponent sen david boren dokla to staunch opponents like 
sens christopher dodd dconn and edward kennedy dmass 
this is the first time in seven years the democrats have come 
together on the issue dodd said but he acknowledged that the 
unity was in large measure because the thorniest issue whether to 
resume sending weapons to the rebels is deferred for a later vote 
under terms of the proposal 
the democratic proposal would provide an additional 27 million 
in humanitarian aid food clothing shelter and medical 
supplies to continue current rates of such aid through next march 
it also promises economic and trade assistance for nicaragua if 
the managua government goes along with a comprehensive final 
agreement to provide for peace and democracy in nicaragua 
conversely some 163 million worth of stockpiled weaponry 
could be released to the rebels if president reagan certifies 
before congress adjourns for the year that two of three conditions 
are met 
the sandinistas have continued their recent pattern of 
repression of political opponents and otherwise violated terms of 
last years regional peace agreement 
nicaragua continues to receive an unacceptable level of 
weaponry from sovietbloc countries including cuba 
the sandinistas have launched an unprovoked military attack 
on the contras 
but the weapons withheld from delivery to rebel forces since 
the two sides entered a ceasefire earlier this year would not be 
released unless both houses of congress voted to accept reagans 
certification 
the house which traditionally has been more opposed to lethal 
aid for the rebels would have to vote first on the presidential 
certification and that appeared to be high on doles list of 
objections 
doles aid proposal would provide the same 27 million in 
humanitarian aid for the rebels but also would create a separate 
new 20 million military aid fund that would be held in escrow to 
be triggered by a later vote of congress if circumstances in 
central america warrant 
the democratic proposal would provide up to 2 million to 
transport the stockpiled weapons which are left over from an 
earlier 100 million lethal aid appropriation the transportation 
presumably would be handled by the cia which handled air drops to 
the contras under the administrations earlier covert aid program 
other features of the democratic plan include up to 10 million 
for use in relocating contra fighters to nicaragua if the two sides 
sign a peace accord providing for democracy there and 5 million 
in medical aid to the civilian population in nicaragua

his patients cant read even the top line 
on the chart and they sometimes respond to his examinations by 
biting kicking or stomping but dr kerry ketring understands 
it happens now and then because they may not understand that 
youre trying to help them said ketring an ophthalmologist and 
veterinarian who works out of cincinnati 
he is called when other veterinarians from dayton ohio to 
lexington ky have a difficult case to diagnose or need a second 
opinion about an eye disease 
the waiting rooms are usually full and he isnt surprised 
pets are important to people as close as relatives many 
times said ketring who also serves as a consultant for zoos and 
research facilities 
the louisville zoo recently brought him a young wallaby a 
relative of the kangaroo 
the wallaby imported from new zealand was still in 90day 
quarantine when the staff noticed she was having trouble moving 
around her quarters and was bumping into things 
ketring spent at least 20 minutes examining the animal before 
announcing shes totally blind the retina is gone 
ketring wouldnt speculate what caused the condition 
hopefully the wallaby can be kept in a controlled environment 
and used for breeding purposes you always try to think15

the university of minnesotas chief 
heartlung surgeon has temporarily stepped down from his leadership 
posts amid controversy generated by an article a newspaper now 
regrets publishing 
the star tribune today said running the story was a serious 
lapse in journalistic judgment 
the newspaper reported tuesday that dr stuart jamieson was 
being investigated by the university for allegedly ordering an 
associate to perform bypass surgery on a patient considered dead 
before the operation began 
the university of minnesota issued a statement wednesday saying 
jamieson was stepping aside temporarily from his positions as head 
of cardiovascular surgery and director of the universitys heart 
and lung institute 
jamieson and university hospitals chief of staff and general 
director have discussed a set of expectations regarding 
compliance with hospital policy and procedure and medical staff 
standards the university said 
in a frontpage statement today star tribune executive editor 
joel kramer said the account of the surgery should not have been 
published because it was based on sources who did not have 
firsthand information to support the account 
the surgeon who performed the operation dr jolene kriett 
has since denied that dr jamieson knew anything about the surgery 
until several hours after it was performed kramer said the 
star tribunes efforts to reach dr kriett before publication of 
the first story were unsuccessful and dr jamieson had refused to 
comment 
publishing the account of the events when we had not 
confirmed it with anyone having firsthand knowledge of the facts 
was a serious lapse in journalistic judgment which we regret he 
said 
jamieson 40 who came to the university two years ago from 
stanford university will continue in his academic position as 
surgery professor and will continue as a member of the medical 
staff of the university of minnesota hospital and clinic the 
university statement said 
jamieson could not be reached for comment because he left on a 
twoweek vacation wednesday the statement said hospital 
authorities had no further comment 
however the st paul pioneer press dispatch quoted sources as 
saying jamieson was asked to step down from the leadership roles 
the newspaper said there has been a sharp dispute over his 
personality and aggressive management style 
kriett told the star tribune and the pioneer press dispatch 
tuesday night that she did not consult with jamieson before 
deciding to operate on a 43yearold woman whose heart had stopped 
beating five times before surgery began 
it sure didnt happen as it was reported in the paper the 
pioneer press dispatch quoted kriett as saying i was the one on 
call and it was my own decision 
dr neal vanselow university vice president for health 
sciences said wednesday that the university is looking into some 
allegations against jamieson and the kriett surgery is one of 
them 
kriett said she canceled the surgery after the patients heart 
stopped beating but decided a few minutes later to proceed with the 
operation in a final attempt to save the womans life

the navy said thursday it is banning topless 
dancers and other sexually oriented entertainment at base clubs for 
officers and sailors in response to charges that it encourages 
abusive behavior toward women 
the prohibition contained in revised regulations for navy mess 
operations was signed june 30 by vice adm leon a edney the 
chief of naval personnel and distributed to navy bases around the 
world 
the navy said the move was approved by adm carlisle ah trost 
chief of naval operations and is effective immediately 
the new guidelines specify that all entertainment at base clubs 
must meet appropriate standards of discretion modesty and good 
taste 
base commanders should use common sense to make sure their clubs 
feature only wholesome and highquality entertainment suitable 
for a typical mixed community audience 
entertainment that could conceivably result in embarrassment 
to the navy shall be avoided the new rules say 
female topless andor bottomless exhibition as well as male 
bottomless and other similar entertainment is prohibited 
the revised rules were recommended last fall by a panel created 
by navy secretary james h webb to survey the status of service 
women after another group the defense advisory committee on women 
in the services issued a blistering critique of the navys 
treatment of females within its ranks and in the marines 
the advisory panel concluded that navy and marine corps women 
serving in the pacific frequently were victims of sexual harassment 
and abuse and appeared to be stuck in deadend assignments offering 
little opportunity for advancement 
webbs study group comprised of 28 male and female officers and 
enlisted personnel largely verified those findings 
the advisory panel pointedly complained about such base 
activities as noontime burlesque shows and diningins that 
emphasize sexually oriented entertainment 
the issue of moral acceptability aside onbase activities 
such as these contribute to creating an environment in which all 
females are regarded with less or no respect and abusive behavior 
toward all women is not only passively accepted and condoned but 
encouraged 
the navy said thursday that edneys directive was intended to 
address that complaint and was endorsed by the female members of 
webbs study group 
the directive says club managers should consider local mess 
patronage the probable participants and potential media reaction 
in selecting club entertainment acts 
the new rules also apply to performers hired for private parties 
at base clubs anyone who reserves space for a private party must 
give the club manager the full particulars of entertainment 
plans the directive says 
regardless of the type of entertainment that may be offered in 
the local community it is not in the best interest of the navy to 
allow standards of taste in entertainment to seek their own level 
on the assumption that anything that people desire is allowable 
it says 
the commanding officer will ensure that any type of 
attraction that does not provide wholesome and highquality 
entertainment shall not be allowed to perform in the mess

a general imprisoned in 1977 for passing swiss 
military secrets to the soviet union and reviled as one of this 
neutral nations worst traitors was freed thursday after serving 
about twothirds of his term 
officials said brig gen jeanlouis jeanmaire 78 was released 
on probation for good behavior he had been sentenced to 18 years 
jeanmaire always portrayed himself as a fervent anticommunist 
has tried twice to have his case reopened and has said in recent 
interviews he would continue the effort to clear his name 
the secret military court that convicted him said he was not 
motivated by ideology or financial gain but by weakness of 
character vanity and resentment about a delayed promotion 
it found jeanmaire guilty on june 17 1977 of passing vital 
defense information to soviet diplomats in bern the swiss capital 
between 1962 and 1975 the sentence including expulsion from the 
army was the stiffest ever given on a swiss citizen for peacetime 
espionage 
prosecutors said he did irreparable harm and gave away 
information of highest importance a government report said he 
betrayed mobilization plans for switzerlands militia army 
after his release from bellechasse prison in fribourg canton 
northeast of geneva jeanmaire was reached by telephone at his bern 
apartment and told the associated press he would not comment for a 
few days he is expected to spend the time celebrating with friends 
the conservative neue zuercher zeitung said thursday one can 
assume the jeanmaire case will not come to rest so soon a veil of 
uncertainty will always stay over the affair since the files must 
for understandable reasons remain secret 
when he retired in 1975 jeanmaire headed the air raid 
protection corps it was a noncombat unit but he was a member of 
the general staff and had inside knowledge of all army branches 
jeanmaire was under surveillance by federal police for a year 
before his arrest aug 9 1976 on a street in lausanne two months 
later before a preliminary investigation was completed justice 
minister kurt furgler spoke of in parliament of an abominable 
deed 
col vassily denissenko was the central soviet figure he was a 
military attache at the bern embassy in 195964 who won jeanmaires 
confidence and friendship 
marielouise jeanmaire the generals wife was acquitted of 
complicity the defense said denissenko seduced mrs jeanmaire who 
has died since the trial but prosecutors accused her of willingly 
helping her husband 
the case was said to have been broken by a tip from west german 
intelligence it caused a national furor in switzerland where the 
army is accorded great respect 
jeanmaire told the court in a closing statement he was caught up 
in the affair unwittingly and was too frightened to inform 
authorities 
swiss media revived the case as his release drew near and some 
newspapers repeated suggestions by his supporters that the 
brigadier was the scapegoat in a coverup by superiors 
a statement tuesday from the federal prosecutors office 
dismissed this argument as contention speculation and absurd 
portrayals but indicated the secrecy requirement precluded a 
detailed rebuttal 
in a tv interview broadcast tuesday jeanmaire said he delivered 
only minor data with the purpose of promoting military deterrence 
by proving switzerlands preparedness to moscow 
andre perret his lawyer claimed the pressure of public opinion 
produced an excessive sentence 
blick a tabloid quoted jeanmaire recently as saying i was 
not guilty as convicted it was never my intention to commit 
treason my case was played up and they had to follow through 
until i was sentenced 
by contrast the neue zuercher zeitung commented the fact 
remains that the exbrigadier general among other things passed 
secret documents to soviet military attaches he was sentenced by a 
proper military court in proper proceedings 
the independent basler zeitung said jeanmaire was never a 
spy of the century but in the same vein his sentence was not a 
scandal of the century

the west a graveyard for democratic 
presidential aspirations in recent years could be the key to 
victory for michael dukakis this fall according to surveys 
conducted for the times mirror co by the gallup organization 
dukakis is currently enjoying a wide lead over vice president 
george bush across most of the nation but the american mood is so 
divided that it could be a close election come november said the 
head of the gallup organization 
the numbers have been pretty wide but the potential to narrow 
is very great said andrew kohut of dukakis lead 
but he added the outlook of westerners appears to have changed 
for example traditionally antigovernment voters in the rocky 
mountains are now calling for more government action on social 
issues than is the average american voter they are most strongly 
in favor of free health care for the needy national health 
insurance and help for the homeless his report said 
the west holds 111 of the 270 electoral votes needed to elect a 
president votes that have gone mostly to republicans in recent 
years 
western voters while optimistic about their own financial 
future are dissatisfied with the general course of the nation and 
they have not found in bush the antiestablishment leader they once 
saw in ronald reagan he wrote 
in national polls taken shortly after his nomination on july 20 
dukakis led bush 54 percent to 39 percent kohut said in releasing 
the new analysis of the election prospects prepared for the times 
mirror co 
while the attention generated by the upcoming republican 
national convention should help bush narrow the gap kohut said he 
expects dukakis to retain a lead at least through the first debate 
between the two men which will likely set the tone for the balance 
of the campaign 
its likely to be a close election its an uncertain 
electorate one that is divided in mood explained kohut on 
the one hand there is short run economic optimism but that is 
balanced in various ways with dissatisfaction with the state of the 
nation 
its a balancing act for both of them he said of bush and 
dukakis 
people clearly dont want radical change they want some 
change but they are not sure what that change is kohut said 
the irancontra scandal has proven a major factor kohut said 
seriously damaging the confidence of many supporters of president 
reagans administration 
that has been a particular problem in the rocky mountain states 
said kohut that region was a bastion of support for reagan and 
many people there saw selling arms to iran as betrayal and are 
really angry 
dukakis led bush 49 percent to 39 percent in the west in surveys 
taken in late june and early july according to kohut the results 
reflected bushs problem of being associated with the irancontra 
scandal but being unable to benefit from economic improvement 
because that area has not done as well as other regions he said 
in may dukakis led 51 percent to 39 percent in the rockies and 
51 percent to 40 percent in the pacific states 
kohut said the regional analyses he released were developed from 
8500 detailed interviews taken between may and july the margin of 
error for a survey of that size is just under 2 percentage points 
either way 
i dont think that either candidate can take for granted 
any state commented kohut all of the big states are close 
except maybe new york he said he showed the massachusetts 
governor leading in the empire state 
dukakis can be expected to do well in the east he said kohut 
noted that the east is dukakis home area and he said easterners 
tend to have a stronger interest in an activist government meaning 
they are more likely to lean toward a democrat the eastern states 
offer 135 electoral votes kohut said 
his junejuly polls showed dukakis leading 49 percent to 41 
percent in the east a separate study taken earlier gave dukakis a 
54 percent to 34 percent lead in new england and 55 percent to 36 
percent in the middle atlantic states 
dukakis lead in the east is significant if soft says 
kohut the region is more likely to disapprove of the reagan 
administration and more willing to endorse an activist social 
agenda he said 
in the midwest with 137 electoral votes bush faces a problem 
with voters the pollster termed the disaffected 
these people supported reagan because he campaigned against 
government as an outsider but many are turning toward the 
democratic party 
in the nations center dukakis leads bush 47 percent to 37 
percent in the junejuly polling the report said in may that lead 
had been 52 percent to 39 percent in the east central states and 52 
percent to 36 percent in the west central 
dukakis midwestern lead is bolstered by economic discontent 
kohut concluded still dukakis edge there is soft and is as 
likely to be fueled by antibush sentiment as by positive support 
for the democratic nominee 
only in the more conservative south with 155 electoral votes 
does bush hold a lead topping dukakis 47 percent to 40 percent 
according to the junejuly survey dukakis had held a narrow 
threepoint lead in the southeast in m

fans of three knuckleheads famed for 
bopping each other on the head throwing pies and chortling 
nyuk nyuk nyuk are writing letters and circulating 
petitions to get the governments attention 
the three stooges they insist deserve to be honored on a us 
postage stamp 
they were the longestrunning comedy team in the history of 
motion pictures laurel and hardy abbott and costello and the marx 
brothers pale in significance compared with the stooges said 
jeff lenberg a southern california writer and stooge historian 
lenberg and other admirers of moe larry and curly not to 
forget shemp joe and curlyjoe say the stooges are part of 
modern american culture 
my father always said their comedy was based on the upsetting 
of dignity and i thought of george washington getting his wig 
knocked off thats what the stooges would have done to him said 
joan howard maurer 
maurer daughter of moe howard the one with the trademark 
bangs and scowl launched the stamp campaign last year in her 
fifth book on the stooges 
after all wc fields was honored with a stamp in 1980 and 
recently the postmaster general said laurel and hardy could appear 
on a stamp 
but stooge afficionados point out that while fields and laurel 
and hardy are seldom seen nowadays the stooges who began with 
vaudeville and reached their height in film are still seen on 
television all over the world 
if you stopped people on the street and showed them a picture 
of the three stooges theyd know them right away said gary 
lassin president of the three stooges fan club with about 2000 
members worldwide 
stephanie salter a san francisco examiner columnist is 
relaying hundreds of prostooge letters to the postal services 
citizens stamp advisory committee 
i just think that its the fact the world is getting heavier 
every day i just cant emphasize the importance of silliness 
salter said 
the silliness as most people know it began in 1934 when moe 
brother curly and a violin player with a receding mop named larry 
fine made women haters their first short for columbia 
the whole concept was that moe was the brains of the outfit 
supported by larry the middleman who was supposed to be a little 
less smart than moe but more intelligent than curly lenberg said 
but moe always came out as not so smart after all he was as 
much a stooge as curly or larry he said 
curly the one with the shaved head and highpitched 
eeebeebeebee was sidelined by a stroke in 1946 and replaced 
by shemp howard shemp died in 1955 and was replaced first by joe 
besser who stayed with the group for three years and finally by 
joe derita who resembled the original curly and was known as 
curlyjoe 
the group kept working until 1970 moe and larry died in 1975 
besser died within the past year and derita now 79 lives in 
north hollywood lenberg said 
while some dislike the violence of the stooges routines fans 
describe the group as a living cartoon 
it smacks of wile e coyote and roadrunner maurer said 
most children unless they really have a behavior problem know 
this is not real you see curly getting hit with an anvil but he 
just scratches his head and says ooooh 
they got away with things everyone wants to get away with but 
cant wouldnt you like to kick your boss in the rear or throw a

many of the 2000 requests the citizens stamp advisory committee 
receives a month are for elvis presley john wayne or marilyn 
monroe said dick rustin manager of stamp information for the 
postal service so far only a few have come from stooge fans he

us businesses efficiency in producing goods 
and services decreased in the second quarter its first decline 
since 1986 the labor department said today 
preliminary data show productivity among nonfarm businesses 
responsible for threefourths of the nations economic activity 
falling 17 percent from april through june compared with the first 
three months of the year the department said 
productivity had risen at an annual rate of 34 percent from 
january through march 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater commented the second 
quarter decline in productivity should be a temporary blip related 
to the drought so it shows the economy is still strong 
reflecting the continuing strong economic expansion output of 
goods and services by nonfarm businesses rose at an annual rate of 
47 percent in the second quarter 
to achieve that workers put in 65 percent more hours the 
largest quarterly increase since 1984 and a reflection of the 
14year low in the nations unemployment rate 
meanwhile labor costs soared 59 percent the largest gain 
since a 61 percent increase in the last quarter of 1986 as hourly 
wages and benefits rose at an annual rate of 41 percent in the 
second quarter 
after taking into consideration a 44 percent annual rate of 
inflation over the last 18 months however workers purchasing 
power actually declined 06 percent from april through june the 
department said 
while businesses as a whole suffered from poorer efficiency in 
the second quarter manufacturers responsible for a fourth of the 
nations economic output continued to show improved productivity 
up 35 percent from the first quarter 
reflecting an ongoing boom in the industrial sector spawned by 
record exports manufacturing output soared 54 percent in the 
second quarter with only a 18 percent increase in the number of 
hours worked 
manufacturers also were much more successful in holding down 
factory wage and benefit increases allowing annual raises of only 
29 percent from april through june 
that enabled employers to actually reduce the labor costs 
associated with each item coming off their assembly lines by 06 
percent even though it meant their workers took a 18 percent cut 
in their purchasing power the government said

nasa computers aborted the 
testfiring of space shuttle discoverys engines a fraction of a 
second before ignition today after reporting a valve problem 
marking another disappointment for the space program 
engineers hoped to ready the shuttle for another attempt on 
sunday but one official said the delay could be as much as a week 
the delay threatened to push back further the first postchallenger 
launch planned for late september 
it was the fifth such postponement in two weeks the test is 
considered crucial for qualifying discovery for the first shuttle 
flight since the challenger explosion 2 years ago 
thats why we have flight readiness firings to work the bugs 
out of equipment before we launch said nasa administrator james 
fletcher 
discoverys three main engines generating total thrust of 11 
million pounds were to fire for 20 seconds in a test of the entire 
shuttle system steel bolts were to hold the spaceship firmly on 
the pad during the firing 
the engines were to have begun firing six seconds before the 
zero mark the shutdown came just after the go for starting the 
engines was issued but before ignition actually began launch 
control center commentator hugh harris said 
harris said the shuttles master computer did not see that the 
engine bleed valve had fully closed and automatically sent a 
shutdown signal 
engineers were trying to determine if there was a faulty valve 
or if the sensor had given an incorrect reading he said the bleed 
valve vents excess gases 
if the engines had fired with the valve open excess pressure 
might have built up in the fuel line and caused a rupture that 
could had led to an explosion said joseph lombardo the main 
engine program manager 
if the problem is with the valve or a sensor discoverys flow 
director john talone said the delay could be between three and 
seven days while the faulty equipment is replaced 
if the problem can be corrected by simply changing computer 
software talone said the turnaround time could be cut to three 
days 
immediately after the shutdown the launch team remotely began 
to make the vehicle safe as it sat on the pad its 154foottall 
tank loaded with 385000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and 143000 
gallons of liquid oxygen harris said 
he said the propellants would be drained from the tank and the 
igniters in each engine would have to be replaced before another 
attempt 
engine no 2 where the problem occurred is one of two brand 
new engines on discovery engine no 1 has been flown on three 
shuttle missions 
program managers have been grooming discovery for the first 
shuttle flight since the loss of challenger and its crew of seven 
in an explosion 73 seconds after liftoff on jan 28 1986 
even before today many officials believed the launch would slip 
into october because of earlier delays in the test and an 
unresolved gas leak in a steering engine system that is separate 
from the main engines 
launch director bob sieck said wednesday that a oneday delay in 
the firing test would move back the launch one day 
among the disappointed observers today were two of the five 
astronauts slated to fly discovery on the first postchallenger 
mission navy capt rick hauck and marine lt col dave hilmers 
soon after the test firing shuttle managers expect to give the 
goahead to a plan for engineers to cut a hole through the rear 
wall of discoverys cargo bay in an effort to reach and repair a 
nitrogen tetroxide leak 
the shuttle program also must pass another key propulsion test 
before discovery can be certified for flight a fullscale firing 
the fifth in a series of the redesigned solid fuel booster rocket 
at the morton thiokol plant in utah it is scheduled about aug 20 
the challenger explosion was blamed on a faulty booster rocket 
joint that allowed flame to escape and ignite the external fuel 
tank

vietnams foreign minister today said 
his country will no longer help account for missing us servicemen 
or cooperate on other humanitarian issues until washington ends its 
hostile policy against my government 
vietnam announced wednesday that it has temporarily halted plans 
for joint efforts to account for missing americans and for 
resettling former political prisoners in the united states 
agreements on the issues had been reached last month 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we 
are very concerned because we thought we were making some progress 
at getting the investigations going about mias and pows 
our position has always been clear fitzwater said i 
guess were a little surprised and not quite sure what vietnam is 
up to here 
the vietnam news agency said foreign minister nguyen co thach 
wrote a letter dated sunday to gen john w vessey a special us 
presidential emissary saying the decision to halt cooperation was 
in response to recent congressional testimony by assistant 
secretary of state gaston sigur 
sigur on july 28 argued against a congressional resolution 
urging the establishment of interest sections diplomatic 
missions below the level of embassies in hanoi and washington 
saying they would not improve cooperation on humanitarian issues 
he called for continued us isolation of vietnam until it ends 
it decadeold military occupation of cambodia 
thach spoke with reporters in bangkok today after holding talks 
on cambodia with thailands foreign minister siddhi savetsila 
asked how long vietnam was suspending cooperation on us 
humanitarian issues he replied i would like to ask gen vessey 
this question how long they will continue such hostile policy 
against my government 
he said it was not a question of the united states apologizing 
but rather a question of hostile policy against my country to 
stop it 
thach and vessey reached an agreement in august 1987 under which 
vietnam pledged to accelerate its accounting of nearly 1800 
americans listing as missing in action in the vietnam war the 
united states pledged to help vietnam with its humanitarian 
problems 
thach told vessey last month that vietnam will try to resolve 70 
top priority mia cases by the end of the year and welcomed joint 
excavations for remains from august to october 
there have no such excavations since the first one in late 1985 
technical experts of the two sides met in hanoi last week to 
work out arrangements and us officials said they anticipated 
joint surveys and investigations that would begin soon 
the two countries held talks in hanoi last month on americas 
offer to resettle former us government employees and officials of 
the usbacked south vietnam government who were put into 
reeducation camps after the 1975 north vietnamese victory 
a joint communique said vietnam was allowing them to emigrate as 
the united states gave assurances it would not encourage them to 
conduct antivietnamese activities 
but the official vietnamese media later blamed the us for lack 
of progress saying the biggest obstacle was the us refusal to 
set up a working group to organize the emigration of about 
500000 of the former inmates and their relatives

the united states has paid 25 million of what it 
owes to the un food and agriculture organization to show it is 
encouraged by the agencys progress in budgetary reform a diplomat 
said thursday 
fao spokesman richard lydiker confirmed the united states made 
the payment last week saying the payment came in the wake of a 
compromise agreement on the budgetary process 
the diplomat said the compromise suggested to the us 
government that fao was making progress toward reforms sought 
by the united states and other nations he also said the us 
government was pleased and encouraged by the favorable 
developments and therefore decided to release the funds 
the united states had withheld payments of its assessments 
which amount to a quarter of the agencys budget in an effort to 
force the organization to make budgetary reforms 
the romebased organization coordinates agricultural projects in 
developing countries and is the largest specialized agency in the 
united nations 
the diplomat who spoke on condition that he not be identified 
by name or country said united states made the payment july 27 in 
washington and that it will be applied to the arrears of 674 
million for 1986 and 1987 
the united states also has not paid its 1988 assessment of 607 
million and 39 million for its share of the working capital and 
special reserve accounts 
the diplomat said the united states has expressed its intention 
to pay its arrears and meet its assessment but that the timing has 
not been determined 
future payments will depend on continued progress by the 
organization in pursuing the reforms he said

an agricultural official on 
thursday warned that swarms of locusts in northern ethiopia will 
breed fast because of recent rains and may invade the central part 
of the country 
hailu kassa head of crop protection and control department in 
the ministry of agriculture said the desert locust control 
organization of east africa has provided 100000 tons of 
insecticide spraying equipment trucks and a plane to fight the 
pests in tigray and eritrea provinces 
the government will provide two more planes it asked the united 
nations food and agricultural organization for more insecticide 
the desert locust control organization said five huge swarms 
were seen flying near asmara capital of eritrea on july 2124 
some of the swarms contained more than 50 million locusts each and 
were capable of eating more than 100 tons of green vegetation in 
one day 
kassa said the locusts had been blown across the red sea from 
saudi arabia by a hurricane they invaded tigray and eritrea after 
farmers started planting crops following a severe drought that 
threatened millions with starvation 
four years ago drought and famine in the region killed an 
estimated 1 million people and spurred the biggest international 
relief operation in history

final checkout work has begun on the air 
forces first stealth bomber and the aircraft will be displayed for 
the first time during a rollout ceremony in midnovember the 
service announced today 
the air force also said that the new bomber designated the b2 
will be powered by four general electric co jet engines will be 
an unusually short plane because of its unique design and will be 
flown by a crew of two reflecting the technology that has gone 
into its development 
the b52 bomber requires a crew of six and the new b1b bomber 
is flown by a crew of four 
todays statement on the stealth bomber marked the second step 
in a process begun last april when the air force finally began to 
lift a decadelong veil of secrecy by releasing an artists sketch 
of the plane 
officials said then that they anticipated the first flight of 
the plane would occur this fall and that additional details 
including a new estimate of cost overruns would be revealed this 
summer 
the air force said today it was not yet prepared to release the 
new cost estimates but it said it still anticipated the bomber 
would make its first flight this fall despite the fact the first 
plane wont be rolled out from its production plant until 
midnovember 
the first b2 wont fly on that day of its public unveiling but 
preparations for that next milestone will be very close to 
completion by then the service said 
the b2 will roll out in midnovember at air force plant 42 in 
palmdale calif additionally the contractor is currently well 
into the assembly phase of aircraft no 2 a statement said 
the northrop corp is the prime contractor for the plane 
the stealth bomber takes its nickname from the fact it is 
designed to fly without showing up on radar 
it resembles a flying wing in shape without a conventional 
fuselage in the center a small cockpit bubble rises on top of the 
flying wing and inlets for the jet engines are placed to each side 
of the cockpit also on top of the wing 
the design allows the aircraft to be fabricated without any 
sharp angles according to pentagon sources the plane also relies 
on the use of radarabsorbing coatings on its exterior surfaces and 
composite materials for construction 
today the air force released the planes dimensions for the 
first time disclosing it was only slightly longer than an f15 jet 
fighter but had a wingspan approaching that of a b52 bomber the 
b2 will stand about 17 feet high 69 feet long and have a wingspan 
of about 172 feet the service said

a bill authorizing the federal government to 
seize more than 500 acres of a developers land adjacent to a 
historic civil war battlefield was cleared thursday for house floor 
action possibly next week 
the house public works and transportation committee approved by 
voice vote an almost identical measure to one passed earlier by the 
house interior and insular affairs committee 
the public works version however stipulated that 30 million 
in interior department rather than transportation department funds 
be used to study whether roads should be closed in the manassas 
national battlefield park in the virginia countryside west of 
washington 
rep robert mrazek dny an early sponsor of the bill said 
the house may vote on the measure aug 10 
the bill would allow the government to seize 542 acres adjacent 
to the park where a developer has proposed a massive shopping 
complex add the tract to the 4600acre park close two roads 
running through the battlefield and build new roads around the park 
congress became involved in the dispute when northern virginia 
developer john t hazel announced plans to build 12 million square 
feet of retail space 17 million square feet of office space and 
560 homes next to the site of two major civil war battles 
hazels first proposal for a modest office park development 
raised no community concerns but when prince william county va 
officials relaxed zoning laws for the parcel hazel expanded his 
development plans 
historians and preservationists complain that the development 
site includes a bluff from which confederate gen robert e lee 
commanded southern troops in the second battle of manassas 
the tract also was the site of two field hospitals they say 
most historians believe that the remains of union and confederate 
dead lie in unmarked graves on the site 
the first battle of manassas fought in july 1861 was the first 
significant land battle of the civil war a surprising confederate 
victory there convinced union authorities that the war would be a 
protracted affair 
more than 20000 casualties were suffered by both sides in the 
second battle of manassas which lasted over three days in august 
1862 most historians agree that lees triumph in that battle 
represented the confederacys greatest victory of the war

vernon walters the us ambassador to the 
united nations today called irans attack on a norwegian tanker 
reprehensible but attributed it to excessive zeal by a local 
commander 
walters said iran and iraq clearly had decided to end their war 
in the persian gulf and that it would take some time for fighting 
to taper off because of pentup hostility on the two sides 
after an eightyear war walters said i dont consider 
two weeks an excessive time to work out ceasefire terms 
the us diplomat recalled the protracted negotiations that were 
required to end the wars in korea and vietnam 
iranian gunboats fired at the norwegian tanker after it had 
refused to stop for inspection shipping executives in the gulf 
said the captain said a few bullets pierced the ship but caused no 
injuries 
walters appearing on a ussponsored telecast to the area 
said any attack on neutral shipping is to be reprehended it is 
wrong 
he said he was quite surprised by the attack and added 
attacks on neutral shipping by belligerents are not justifiable 
by any circumstances 
and yet walter said i think this was a case of excessive 
zeal by a local commander i think both countries have maintained 
that their national choice is for peace 
what we are witnessing is some of the bitterness and some of 
the hostility of eight years of war manifesting itself walters 
said but in my view the two countries have made the choice for 
peace 
for the second time this week the us ambassador supported 
iraqs demand for facetoface negotiations with iran 
i dont believe it is possible for two countries to make peace 
without facetoface discussions he said i have never heard 
of a peace being achieved entirely through third parties 
his statement raised questions about us policy on the issue 
phyllis oakley the state department spokeswoman renewed the 
us call for swift implementation of the ceasefire without 
conditions that only prolong the delay 
the united nations security councils ceasefire resolution does 
prescribe direct negotiations between the two sides 
but watlers said it is perfectly obvious that 
facetoface talks must take place between the two parties who have 
been at war 
on another subject the us ambassador called for participation 
by some sort of palestinian delegation in arabisraeli peace 
but a state department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said walters remarks did not mean a change in us 
policy 
the reagan administration has called for palestinian 
participation but not in a separate delegation the plan forwarded 
by secretary of state george p shultz calls for palestinians to 
participate in a joint delegation with jordan 
walters stressed that jordan must take part in any negotiations 
in view of its border with israel 
on sunday king hussein announced he was severing legal and 
administrative links to the west bank and surrendering the areas 
future to the palestine liberation organization 
the territory with a predominantly palestinian arab population 
was held by jordan from 1948 until 1967 and by israel since then

prime minister ingvar carlsson in 
testimony thursday defended the governments role in a secret and 
partially illegal private investigation into the 1986 murder of his 
predecessor olof palme 
carlsson speaking to a parliamentary inquiry into the 
politically explosive affair shifted responsibility for misconduct 
in the investigation to national police chief nilserik ahmansson 
but he said he supported the investigation in principle because 
it was checking allegations that the security police had failed to 
act on a tip received shortly before palme was shot 
palme prime minister for 13 years was assassinated feb 28 
1986 while walking unguarded in downtown stockholm official 
investigations failed to produce a motive or lead to the 
prosecution of any suspect despite a reward of about 8 million 
carlssons testimony ended a week of nationally televised 
hearings in the affair which has become a major issue for the 
sept 18 general election the constitution committee was to report 
on the extent of the governments involvement and whether it broke 
the law 
critics accused the ruling social democrats of exceeding their 
authority and sidestepping official investigators on june 7 
justice minister annagreta leijon was forced to quit because of 
her role 
the secret inquiry was conducted by ebbe carlsson a publisher 
linked to the inner circle of the social democratic party he is 
not related to the prime minister 
ahmansson was under pressure to resign after allegations that he 
tacitly approved the use of outlawed surveillance devices a former 
policeman has been indicted for smuggling the equipment 
the publisher testified earlier that he believed palme was 
killed by members of the kurdish workers party pkk possibly 
acting on orders from iran after palme threatened to stop the sale 
of swedish weapons to teheran 
the kurdish theory had been discarded by prosecutors in charge 
of the case after a yearlong investigation 
prime minister carlsson said the unconventional private 
investigation was justified by the overriding importance of 
uncovering clues in the 29monthold murder 
there were important allegations with serious accusations and 
serious criticism against a swedish authority my reaction was that 
this must immediately be checked out he said 
carlsson said he was told of the investigation by mrs leijon 
who only learned about it in about two months after it began in 
january 
in earlier testimony thursday mrs leijon said she had been 
under the impression that ahmansson was in charge of ebbe 
carlssons search ahmansson has acknowledged ebbe carlsson acted 
on his orders but he has denied approving any wrongdoing 
mrs leijons line of defense appeared aimed at clearing the 
social democratic party from charges that it acceded to an illegal 
operation 
she quit after disclosures that she wrote a letter of 
introduction for ebbe carlsson to british intelligence authorities 
copies were kept secret in her private safe in defiance of required 
procedure 
in her letter written in may mrs leijon said ebbe carlsson was 
working on my behalf replying to critics who said the letter 
proved her responsibility mrs leijon said it was carelessly 
worded and it was not meant to imply that she was in charge of 
the investigation by carlssons team 
that prompted center party committee member bertil fiskesjo to 
say that everybody seems eager to say that ebbe carlsson did not 
act on assignment sometimes i ask myself if he exists at all

raising levels of socalled good cholesterol 
and lowering levels of bad cholesterol in men with elevated 
cholesterol levels lowered their risk of coronary heart disease 
says a study released thursday 
the findings followed up a fiveyear experiment by the helsinki 
heart study in which a drug called gemfibrozil was used to raise 
the level of highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol the good 
cholesterol and lower damaging lowdensity cholesterol ldl in 
a group of 2051 men 40 to 45 years old with elevated levels of 
cholesterol other than hdl 
the initial report of the experiment published in november 
showed the group who took the drug suffered 34 percent fewer heart 
attacks than 2030 other men who were given placebos over the same 
period 
the followup study emphasizes the role of hdl in lowering heart 
disease risks and will change the way doctors measure cholesterol 
levels said dr vesa maaninen of helsinki university 
there was a twofour percent drop in numbers of cardiac 
arrests with every one percent increase in hdl cholesterol said 
maaninen 
many studies have shown previously that there is a statistical 
link between high levels of hdl low levels of ldl and a reduced 
likelihood of coronary heart disease in which waxy buildups in 
the coronary arteries slow and ultimately prevent the flow of blood 
to the heart muscle 
barry lewis a british pathologist at londons st thomas 
hospital said that on average nearly twothirds of people in 
industrialized nations have high ldl cholesterol 
he said that while most people can lower ldl cholesterol levels 
and raise hdl levels with a change of diet some have persistently 
high levels and would benefit most from medication 
maaninen came to london to report these latest findings being 
published this week in the journal of the american medical 
association 
maaninen said the drug produced little difference in the rate of 
cardiac arrests in the first two years but that after that the 
rate decreased the longer the men took the drug 
marshall molloy a spokesman for the manufacturers 
warnerlambert co said gemfibrozil has been approved temporarily 
in the united states and awaits final approval from the food and 
drug administration

have been uncovered

supplied testtakers with answers or let other people sit in for 
them 
others charged were former air force officers john phelps paul 
seiler and kenneth turano

a savings and loan trade group called on 
federal regulators thursday to freeze the growth of walking 
dead thrift institutions that are insolvent but still open 
charles john koch chairman of the national council of savings 
institutions said at a news conference that the federal home loan 
bank board should bar 444 hopelessly insolvent sampls from making 
new loans 
koch said the bank board cannot practically close down all 
insolvent institutions immediately but it should take steps now to 
ensure that the insolvents do not hurt the profitability of the 
rest of the industry 
he said many insolvent institutions are betting on a decline in 
interest rates by pricing their loans at rates slightly under those 
offered by profitable institutions and paying slightly higher rates 
on deposits thus forcing the relatively healthy segment of the 
industry to narrow its profit margin 
our point is theyre not real people any more they 
shouldnt be allowed to compete with solvent institutions he 
said these walking dead are calling into question the 
ability of the remaining 85 percent of the industry to survive 
m danny wall chairman of the bank board said in an interview 
earlier this week that the agency is stepping up its enforcement of 
growth limits originally put on the books in 1985 
however koch complained that 105 of the 444 insolvent thrift 
associations were permitted to grow last year 32 of them faster 
than 10 percent 
mark clark a spokesman for the us league of savings 
institutions the largest sampl trade group said the league has been 
urging the bank board for three years to more strictly police 
growth regulations already in force 
sen william proxmire dwis chairman of the senate banking 
committee said earlier this week he will introduce a resolution 
calling for a freeze on deposit growth of insolvent sampls

the american civil liberties union sued thursday 
to try to block a new law outlawing pregnancyforpay contracts 
the lawsuit in wayne county circuit court challenges the 
surrogacy laws constitutionality and seeks a hearing on a request 
to prevent it from taking effect sept 1 said howard simon 
executive director of the aclus michigan chapter 
the law outlaws surrogacy whenever money changes hands and makes 
surrogacy brokers subject to five years in prison and 5000 fines 
three infertile couples who are the surrogate parents to 
children conceived under contract and two surrogate mothers have 
agreed to be anonymous plaintiffs john and jane doe simon said 
if we lose there is a chance this will be the end of 
surrogacy simon said predicting that bills like that enacted in 
michigan would be introduced in other states 
state sen connie binsfeld a former michigan mother of the year 
who led the fight to enact michigans law said her goal was to put 
noel keane of dearborn one of the nations most prolific surrogacy 
matchmakers out of business 
by keanes count he has been responsible for 238 surrogate 
births since 1978 forty more surrogate babies are on the way he 
said wednesday 
keane is not a party in the suit 
i want to distance myself from the lawsuit he said i 
want the issue to be the right of procreation thats on trial 
not noel keanes entrepreneurship 
keane typically collects 10000 from a couple he connects with 
a woman willing to be artificially inseminated carry a child to 
term and then give up custody keane handles the contract and 
arranges the inseminations 
simon said the lawsuit would challenge the constitutionality of 
the law establishing felony penalties for people who enter into 
surrogacy agreements 
this is sex discrimination he said noting the 
inconsistency of laws that permit an infertile man to arrange a 
pregnancy via a sperm donor but deny the same right to an infertile 
woman 
we are dealing with the most fundamental rights that people 
have rights involving the decision to have children simon 
said there is no justification for the state with its huge hand 
to come in and criminalize those decisions

jordan said thursday it will lay off or 
retire the 21200 palestinian employees at its institutions in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip which effectively turns 
over responsibility to the plo 
the decision announced after a cabinet meeting was the most 
sweeping in practical effect since king hussein announced sunday he 
was cutting links with the territories where 15 palestinians live 
jordan has paid at least 45 million a year in salaries to its 
employees in the west bank and gaza including expenditures for 
hospitals islamic institutions agriculture and education its 
annual outlay has been estimated at 200 million 
those working for courts and the authority that controls mosques 
and other religious institution are exempt the announcement said 
reaction among palestinians was mixed 
i dont think it is fair said jamila azmi 55 who has 
received a jordanian salary during 30 years in bethlehems school 
system who is going to take care of the fired employees 
she said some of those laid off would have to take jobs in 
israel which leaders of the 8monthold uprising in the occupied 
lands have discouraged 
hanna siniora a newspaper editor who supports the palestine 
liberation organization praised the move and said those who 
will be hurt can be compensated by the palestinian side i assume 
that the political vacuum left by jordan will be filled by the 
plo 
rashad al shawaa the deposed mayor of gaza city and a supporter 
of hussein said the kings action puts the whole responsibility 
on the plo if the plo can shoulder it very good if not then the 
plo must go back to jordan and tell the king we need your 
cooperation and help 
a senior jordanian official said privately the government also 
is expected to abolish martial law in the west bank nominally in 
force since the 1967 middle east war he said this would give the 
plo greater responsibility over west bank affairs 
an end to jordanian martial law would have comparatively little 
effect since israel captured the west bank in the war but one 
result apparently would be dissolution of the 13member ministerial 
committee that supervises jordan river bridge crossings 
what impact that would have on movement across the allenby 
bridge the only open border crossing between israelioccupied 
territory and hostile arab states was not clear immediately 
the committee also had barred west bank palestinians from 
dealing with israel or selling their land to israeli authorities 
jordan radio said the decision to lay off or retire the civil 
servants is in accordance with the kingdoms decision to cut 
legal and administrative links with palestinians in the occupied 
lands all jordanian citizens working for official and government 
agencies will be retired as of aug 16 
it said civil servants with less than 15 years of service will 
be dismissed with a months salary for every year of service a 
jordanian official said 16000 fell into that category and the plo 
would be responsible for their jobs or welfare 
those with more than 15 years and less than 20 will continue 
receiving salaries until they retire on pensions at 20 years the 
report said the official also speaking on condition of anonymity 
said 5200 were were in that group 
husseins latest decision also ends the services of an 
unspecified number of workers at private institutions and companies 
linked to the government who will receive severance pay according 
to their employers rules the radio said 
on saturday the king dissolved the lower house of the jordanian 
parliament 30 of whose 60 members were palestinians from the west 
bank he also has canceled a 13 billion development program for 
education and economic projects in the west bank

the united states intends to press 
negotiations for a new lease for a major air base in greece 
despite a warning from athens that the base will be closed a 
senior state department official said thursday 
assistant secretary of state rozanne l ridgway told a house 
hearing she was surprised by the greek statement wednesday that the 
hellenikon base would be shut down the base is used to monitor 
soviet ship movements in the mediterranean 
in our view the subject is still on the table and is not 
affected by this announcement she told the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on europe and the middle east 
the most recent round of talks which began in november 1987 
regarding the future of four major us air bases in greece failed 
to resolve the question of hellenikon she said 
the ninth round of negotiations on new base leases is scheduled 
for sept 9 the current fiveyear agreement expires on dec 31 
ms ridgway said the greek announcement may have been intended 
for internal consumption or made by someone intent on accelerating 
the slowmoving negotiations 
premier andreas papandreou is a socialist who came to power in 
1981 vowing to close american bases on greek soil he has since 
relented but is under constant pressure from leftist groups to win 
us political and economic concessions in exchange for lease 
renewals 
hellenikon with its highprofile location near the athens 
airport has been the site of antiamerican demonstrations 
at the hearing ms ridgway defended the reagan administrations 
decision to sell greece 500 shoulderfired antiaircraft stinger 
missiles she said greece was a vital member of nato and a loyal 
us ally 
rep donald e lukens rohio said he was angered by 
papandreous antiamerican positions 
i am fed up with the behavior of this man who cant even 
fulfill his obligations to his wife never mind to nato lukens 
said the greek premier is reported to have had marital problems 
with his americanborn wife 
rep lawrence smith dfla criticized the stinger sales in 
light of several recent terrorist attacks in greece including the 
slaying of a us military attache and a bloody assault on a cruise 
liner 
smith noted that the stingers are coveted by guerrilla groups 
because they are portable and easy to use ms ridgway said the 
state department did not have any evidence that us military 
equipment provided to greece had fallen into terrorists hands

the house passed and sent to president reagan 
on thursday legislation providing apologies and 20000 taxfree 
payments to japaneseamerican survivors of world war ii internment 
camps 
reagan has said he will sign the bill ending a sad chapter in 
american history in a way that reaffirms americas commitment to 
the preservation of liberty and justice for all 
approval came on a 257156 vote with supporters saying the 
apology would have been an empty one without cash payments 
opponents argued that america faced a grave threat with the 
outbreak of war and that mistakes were made and many other lives 
disrupted 
about 60000 people are eligible for the lumpsum payments but 
the government will have 10 years to make all the payments 
totalling 125 billion the elderly will be iven priority but the 
first people likely wont be paid until january 1990 anybody 
living at the time the bill is signed qualifies and only their 
immediate family can collect if they die before payment no 
payments will be made to the families of those who have died before 
the bill is signed 
more than 120000 japaneseamericans were sent to internment 
camps beginning in 1942 and ending early in 1946 a federal 
commission that originally recommended the payments in 1982 
estimated that about 60000 survive 
one of those survivors is rep norman y mineta dcalif who 
was 10 years old when he and his parents were sent to a camp at 
santa anita racetrack in southern california in 1942 
though this is a deeply personal issue for myself and a 
comparatively small number of americans this legislation touches 
the heart and soul of what it means to be an american and 
therefore the very core of our nation said mineta who sat in 
the speakers chair for the vote 
i sense history in the making ben blaz the delegate from 
guam told the house before the vote blaz said that he maneta and 
rep robert matsui dcalif were all incarcerated in our youths 
but there was one difference my guards were enemy soldiers theirs 
were american soldiers 
rep bill frenzel rminn an early opponent of the 
reparations said he changed his mind and supported the bill 
because i see this as an important national apology it is a 
time for apology and reunification and i intend to be a part of 
it 
but rep howard coble rnc said i can argue that in a time 
of war when a country is threatened for its very survival as this 
country was many things happened and many lives were disrupted for 
many reasons 
rep helen delich bentley rmd said her husband was a korean 
war veteran and that he told her if you want a fast divorce you 
vote for that legislation ms bentley said she her husband and 
other veterans opposed the bill 
in addition to benefiting japaneseamerican internees the 
legislation authorizes payments of up to 12000 for surviving 
members of the aleut indian tribes who were removed from the 
aleutian islands during the japanese attack on those islands in 
1942 
it was early in 1942 when president franklin d roosevelt signed 
an order that said the war department could designate military 
areas from which people could be excluded 
later military orders resulted in the exclusion of all people of 
japanese ancestry from california washington and oregon and some 
in hawaii the orders affected 77000 us citizens and 43000 
legal and illegal resident aliens all were taken to prison camps 
in the western states 
the last camp was closed in january 1946

trial were accused of turning wedtech into a racketeering 
enterprise that dispensed millions in bribes to win nobid 
contracts set aside for minorityowned businesses

democratic lawmaker because the bronx defense contractor had 
friends in the reagan white house including attorney general edwin 
meese iii meese has not been charged with wrongdoing in the 
scandal 
biaggi 70 was convicted of all but one of 16 counts including 
conspiracy extortion tax evasion and receiving bribes he faces

extorting 50000 in cash and stock once worth more than 3 million 
and filing false financial disclosure statements and income tax 
returns to cover up his illegal profits 
biaggi removed his glasses rubbed his eyes and shook his head 
then stared ahead his hands folded atop his cane as the verdict

congressmans eldest son was convicted of racketeering and 
conspiracy but a prosecutor informed the judge that the jury had 
found that the younger biaggi had committed only a single 
racketeering act and at least two are needed to sustain a 
racketeering conviction 
us district judge constance baker motley ruled that the 
younger biaggi had been acquitted of racketeering and conspiracy 
but was convicted of two lesser counts 
acquitted of racketeering was ronald betso a former city 
policeman and friend of neglias 
after the younger biaggi was cleared of the racketeering counts 
he walked across the courtroom and hugged and kissed his father 
the trial which began march 11 generated nearly 20000 pages 
of transcripts 
more than 130 witnesses were called including four former 
wedtech executives who testified for the government in exchange for 
leniency the four admitted bribing public officials defrauding 
the government and stealing from the company in concert with 
mariotta 
at the heart of the wedtech case was how welbilt electronic die 
corp a tiny bronx machine shop started by mariotta grew into 
wedtech corp a multimilliondollar defense contractor with 
friends in high places 
mariotta a semiliterate tool and die maker of hispanic 
descent was once hailed as a hero for the 80s by president 
reagan for hiring exconvicts and former drug addicts in one of 
americas most depressed areas 
prosecutors charged that mariotta and other wedtech officials 
paid bribes in cash political contributions stock or stock 
options to biaggi simon and neglia for their assistance with city 
and federal agencies 
ehrlich the younger biaggi and betso were accused of helping 
the others either receive or cover up the payoffs 
the defense argued that the corrupt wedtech executives had pull 
with white house insiders like meese and thus did not need to bribe 
biaggi however motley denied a defense request to call meese as a 
witness 
prosecutors claimed the meese defense was a smokescreen to 
divert attention from the defendants 
assistant us attorney edward j little stunned the courtroom 
during closing arguments when he called meese a sleaze but 
insisted that any wrongdoing by the attorney general littles 
boss had nothing to do with the biaggi case 
a special prosecutor in washington has determined there was 
insufficient evidence to charge meese with any wrongdoing but he 
questioned the attorney generals ethics on several issues 
biaggi did not take the stand after the judge gave prosecutors 
latitude to crossexamine him about his conviction for obstruction 
and accepting an illegal gratuity he was sentenced in november to 
2 years in jail and fined 500000 
that conviction was upheld this week by a federal appeals court 
the house ethics committee staff recommended in february that 
biaggi be expelled for the earlier conviction but decided to put 
off action on the matter until biaggi was available to defend 
himself

the government on thursday lifted 
price controls for many goods and services including energy and 
transport in a measure likely to fuel inflation and social 
tensions 
the widespread lifting of price controls at a time when 
inflation is hovering around 180 percent applies to those on 
gasoline diesel fuel electricity cooking gas coal rail 
transport and postal services 
these prices strictly controlled by the state for most of the 
post world war ii period will be formed freely by their producers 
the staterun press reported 
manufacturers of cooking oil flour and bread also were allowed 
price increases but the staples still will be under government 
control the reports said 
the government measure has already hit yugoslavs with a 39 
percent increase in the price of electricity an average 55 percent 
rise in the cost of rail transport and a 66 percent rise in the 
price of cooking oil 
other producers including those of fuel and bread have yet to 
announce their new prices 
workers have staged several protest marches following the 
introduction in may of a government program which allowed 
substantial price increases and hefty wage cuts 
the may measures lifted price controls for about 60 percent of 
goods and services which have been frozen since november 
the steps are designed to curb the countrys inflation and repay 
the 21 billion foreign debt by introducing a more marketoriented 
economy 
the government together with the international monetary fund 
which has helped in designing the program have set a target that 
yugoslav inflation should drop to 95 percent by the end of 1988 
the latest official evaluations however show that due to the 
wave of price increases prospects are dim that the target will be 
reached according to the most optimistic estimates yugoslavias 
annual inflation rate will be at least 130 percent by the end of 
1988 
the unpopular government measures are likely to contribute to a 
further decline in living standards which have already fallen by 
at least one third since 1980 labor unrest is also expected to 
grow 
anticipating the price increases most yugoslavs have been on a 
shopping spree in recent weeks for cooking oil and sugar causing 
shortages of those products

swedish and dutch scientists have 
pinpointed the virus behind the sudden death of thousands of north 
sea club seals an expert said thursday 
we can now absolutely dismiss the theories about a herpes 
virus the swedish news agency tt quoted virologist berndt 
klingeborn as saying 
klingborn of the biomedical center in the city of uppsala said 
the virus belonged to a group known as the picornaviridae he said 
it was only a matter of weeks before scientists develop a vaccine 
at least 6700 seals have been killed in northern european 
waters in an epidemic that was first detected in denmark in 
midapril dead seals have been found on swedish danish 
norwegian west german and dutch coasts 
klingeborn said scientists worked for months to isolate the 
virus believed to undermine the seals diseasefighting immune 
system leading to fatal pneumonia or liver infection 
scientists here and in other northern european countries have 
discussed a possible link between the deaths and pollution of the 
baltic and north seas 
klingeborn said the seals may have congregated in the few areas 
where the water remained clean and food was plentiful and in 
that way have been exposed to a greater risk of infection 
he said different animals could be victims to different strains 
of pircorna viruses which explained why gray seals were not 
affected by the epidemic

the question about michael dukakis health 
that led to president reagans flip retort on wednesday led to 
queries on thursday about just who may attend and ask questions at 
white house briefings 
everyone who wants a credential gets one said white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
if youve got a news outlet that reaches the public it 
defines you as eligible for a white house press pass im certainly 
not aware of anyone we dont let in he said 
reagan touched off a political flap wednesday when asked whether 
he felt dukakis the democratic presidential nominee should 
release his medical records the questioner nicholas benton of the 
executive intelligence review a publication founded by political 
extremist lyndon larouche also referred to dukakis mental health 
look im not going to pick on an invalid the president 
said a short time later he said he had just been kidding and 
shouldnt have said what he did 
fitzwater was asked at thursdays news briefing whether the 
invalid remark was inadvertent or calculated and whether the 
white house took a hand in spreading rumors that dukakis had 
psychiatric problems in the past the spokesman refused to comment 
on all questions relating to reagans remark 
both dukakis and his doctor denied the candidate had ever 
received psychiatric counseling 
fitzwater said thursday the white house does not make value 
judgments in deciding whether benton or some 2000 other 
journalists are entitled to press passes 
those assigned to cover the white house on a regular basis who 
work for a recognized news organization are accredited 
according to white house rules 
fitzwater said courts have held it is a violation of freepress 
rights protected by the first amendment to the constitution to deny 
white house credentials based on a reporters affiliation 
but sometimes the lines between advocacy and reporting are 
blurry 
in 1977 the standing committee of correspondents which helps 
administer the congressional press galleries reprimanded the rev 
lester kinsolving and stripped him of his capitol hill press 
credentials for accepting money from a foreign government 
the state department correspondents association revoked 
kinsolvings membership in that organization an action that did 
not prevent kinsolving from attending department news briefings 
kinsolving an episcopal priest and syndicated columnist 
acknowledged accepting 2500 in stock and expenses from a law firm 
representing south africa 
kinsolving was reinstated by the congressional press galleries 
after he quit working for the south africans 
some reporters protested that kinsolving was the victim of a 
double standard they noted that for example representatives of 
the soviet government news agency tass were accepted by the 
correspondents groups 
the white house correspondents association does not have any 
authority to determine who attends presidential news conferences or 
who gets white house press credentials kinsolving has been a 
frequent questioner at white house briefings 
from time to time association members have discussed a policy 
that would treat reporters who cover the white house regularly 
differently from those who are occasional visitors but the idea is 
to guarantee access to newsworthy events that attract a crowd not 
bar anyone for their political beliefs 
the problem of access prompted one reporter thursday to demand 
from fitzwater an explanation of why a representative of a larouche 
publication can attend presidential news briefings while reporters 
from midsize outoftown newspapers have trouble getting through 
the white house gate 
fizwater promised to look into it

the largest testing program yet in a specific 
group of americans has found that just more than one in 1000 
activeduty military personnel have been exposed to the aids virus 
lower than among the general population officials said thursday 
the us centers for disease control said 2232 of 1752191 
people on active duty on april 24 had tested positive for 
antibodies to the virus which causes aids a rate of 13 per 1000 
the defense department began screening for aids exposure in 
january 1986 
the activeduty personnel aids infection rate probably 
underrepresents the prevalence in the civilian population for 
three reasons the cdc said 
those reasons are homosexual men and injectable drug abusers 
are because of rules less common among military personnel than in 
the general population hemophilia victims are not eligible for 
military service and military recruits who test positive for aids 
infections are not enlisted 
aids is spread most often through sex or the sharing of infected 
hypodermic needles hemophilia patients were at risk because of the 
bloodderived clotting products they must take although 
purification techniques have greatly lessened that concern 
federal health officials have estimated that 15 million 
americans are infected with the aids virus that would be roughly 
five times the rate among activeduty military personnel 
despite the differing infection rates for the two groups the 
military data can be used for monitoring levels and trends of 
infection in the united states the atlantabased cdc said in its 
weekly report 
for example the agency noted blacks in the military were 36 
times as likely as whites to test positive for aids antibodies and 
hispanics were 25 times as likely 
black personnel tested positive at a rate of 29 per 1000 
compared to 2 per 1000 for hispanics and 08 per 1000 for whites 
although blacks and hispanics constituted 51 percent of those 
testing positive those groups represented only 23 percent of the 
activeduty population 
blacks and hispanics who make up about 18 percent of the us 
population also have a disproportionate share of the actual aids 
cases reported in the united states 41 percent 
the defense department plans to continue to test all activeduty 
personnel for aids infections at least every year or two the cdc 
said therefore the incidence of new infection can be 
measured directly 
this is the closest to a general population in which it will 
be possible to actually measure the rate of new infections said 
dr tim dondero a cdc aids specialist 
a september 1987 report showed seven new infections for every 
10000 army personnel during a year the cdc said 
the pentagon reported earlier this year that in testing nearly 4 
million people since october 1985 both recruits and activeduty 
personnel roughly 15 positive aids test results were found in 
every 1000 people tested that figure includes recruits who tested 
positive and then were not enlisted 
the new activeduty findings are pretty consistent with whats 
been seen in the other groups particularly the recruits dondero 
said 
among activeduty age groups the highest rate of positive aids 
tests was among those 2529 21 per 1000 the lowest was among 
personnel 1719 01 per 1000

told the court a telephone number found in hamadis address book 
led french police to arrest the suspected leader of a terrorist 
group 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport on jan 13 1987 after 
customs officials discovered liquid explosives in his luggage 
braun said the paris telephone number found in hamadis book 
next to the name of ali the tunisian belonged to a man 
identified as fouad ali salah 
salah was arrested in march 1987 by french police and is 
suspected of being the leader of a hezbollah terrorist cell that 
allegedly carried out 10 bomb attacks in paris in the fall of 1986 
the bombings killed 10 people and injured 270 others 
salah and 10 other suspected hezbollah members are still in 
french custody braun told the court 
hezbollah is a radical iranianbacked shiite moslem group in 
lebanon that is suspected of holding western hostages one of 
mohammed hamadis brothers abdulhadi is hezbollahs security 
chief in beirut 
another hamadi brother abbas was convicted by a west german 
court in apil of masterminding the kidnapping of two west germans 
in beirut in an attempt to force the west german government to free

one west german alfred schmidt was released in september but 
the second rudolf cordes remains a hostage 
during his trial that began in july mohammed hamadi has denied 
being a member of hezbollah he has also testified that some of the 
numbers found in his telephone book had been written by a man in 
beirut at whose home he had left the book for several days 
braun also told the court that french police seized seven 
bottles of liquid explosives when they arrested salah 
the explosives were of exactly the same type found in hamadis 
luggage braun said 
after hamadis arrest in frankfurt more of the same explosives 
where found buried in the west german state of saarland near the 
french border hamadi has admitted to smuggling the explosives into 
west germany in january 1987

number of hezbollah headquarters in beirut when they arrested salah 
earlier thursday another witness testified that hamadi sought 
to trade freedom from prison for the two west german hostages in 
lebanon 
gabriel lapite said hamadi gave him the telephone number of a 
sister in beirut with the request tell her that my brother 
should start to go to work both germans should not be freed unless 
i am released 
lapite a nigerian who was imprisoned on drug charges in a cell 
near hamadis for three months in 1987 did not say which of 
hamadis brothers was to be contacted he also did not say if he 
placed the phone call and chief judge heiner mueckenberger did not 
ask him 
lapite testified that mohammed hamadi gave him five letters to 
mail to family members and friends lapite said he did not mail the 
letters and gave them to police 
reiner hamm a lawyer representing hijack victims and their 
families in the trial said the letters tried to arrange hamadis 
release from prison

union carbide corp said thursday it has found a 
way to avoid using ozonedestroying chemicals in making foam used 
for furniture padding 
the technology could eliminate 70 percent of the use of 
ozonedestroying chlorofluorocarbons in the flexible foam industry 
which now accounts for 12 percent to 15 percent of the worlds 
chlorofluorocarbon use said john televantos of the company 
carbide immediately will start selling the ingredients to make 
the new polyurethane foam company representatives said at a news 
conference 
chlorofluorocarbons eat away at the atmospheres ozone layer 
which blocks out harmful solar rays scientists say further 
thinning of the ozone layer could increase skin cancers 
last september two dozen nations signed a treaty to reduce the 
use of cfcs 
foam manufacturers use cfcs to make foam softer they can also 
use methylene chloride but that may also be phased out by federal 
regulators because it is suspected of causing cancer carbide 
officials said 
officials declined to give details of the new technology citing 
patent considerations the new foam called ultracel also provides 
improved comfort support and durability officials said 
the foam is not a practical substitute for providing bulk as in 
the armrest of a chair or for some packaging said televantos

the social security administration said 
thursday it can provide free detailed individual financial 
statements to workers estimating how large a benefit check they 
will get each month when they retire 
the new personal earnings and benefit estimate statement 
will also disclose how much a worker and family would get each 
month in disability or survivors benefits 
the computergenerated disclosure statements will be available 
by mail free on written request from anyone who has paid social 
security taxes is under 65 years old and is not yet drawing 
benefits 
the statements fulfill a promise that president reagan made in 
his last state of the union address and caps a twoyear drive by 
social security commissioner dorcas r hardy to give the public a 
better idea of their personal stake in the huge retirement 
disability and survivors program 
those interested can call a tollfree number 18009372000 
to request copies of the disclosure form ssa7004 
all they have to do is fill it out put a stamp on it and the 
agency will send back their statement in two to three weeks hardy 
said at a news conference 
social security pays out more than 200 billion a year in cash 
benefits to 38 million retirees disabled workers and their 
families but it is probably the most misunderstood program in 
the entire federal government hardy said 
she said many people do not understand the survivors and 
disability protection and others confuse it with a private 
savings or checkings account 
by putting a precise dollars and cents value on those 
benefits and individualizing it for the person making the request 
social security will no longer seem so mysterious and complex 
she said 
some private companies charge people for making the kind of 
estimates that social security now will be doing free 
hardy said it will serve as a viable financial planning tool 
and i urge everyone to take advantage of this new improved 
service 
social securitys old earnings statement form has been widely 
criticized as hard to read confusing and skimpy on useful 
information the agency generally provided estimates of benefits at 
age 65 only for those 60 or older 
for younger workers hardy said benefit estimations were 
extremely difficult we could not have supplied this by mail we 
could do it by handcalculation if you insisted in a district 
office but we really were not in the business of providing that 
kind of service at all 
the new form asks people to list their name ninedigit social 
security number date of birth actual earnings from last year and 
estimated earnings this year as well as the age at which they plan 
to retire 
the form also asks for a single estimate of future average 
yearly earnings but advises that most people should enter the 
same amount as this years estimated earnings 
the agency then will mail back a computergenerated booklet 
spelling out how much in social securitycovered wages the person 
earned each year since 1951 and estimating how much he or she paid 
in payroll taxes it will give a lump sum for 19371950 
the booklet will tell how many credits a person has earned 
toward social security coverage a worker now gets one credit for 
each 470 of wages up to a maximum of four credits a year and 
needs 20 credits to be insured for disability and 40 credits for 
retirement benefits 
then it will give estimates in todays dollars of how much the 
person would get if he or she retires at 62 65 or 70 for younger 
workers who will be expected to work until 66 or 67 to draw full 
retirement benefits that age is used instead of 65 
estimates also are given for payments to widows or widowers and 
children under 18 on death or disability 
the old earnings statement provided only a fraction of this 
information it broke out individual earnings only for the four 
most recent years and did not list how much tax was paid 
hardy expressed hope that the financial notices would remind 
people to plan early for their retirement and that social 
security was never intended as a complete source of retirement 
income 
she said 300000 in new computer software was required for the 
service and the agency now expects to get 6 million requests a 
year for earnings statements double the 3 million it has been 
handling it will cost 37 cents to fulfill each request up from 33 
cents previously 
the social security administration expects the program to help 
it detect errors in its earnings records about three percent of 
the 1600 people in a pilot test found mistakes on their earnings 
statements 
those who detect errors must provide documentation of their 
actual earnings to ensure their benefits are in the right amount 
hardy said 
social security has always encouraged people to check their 
earnings record every three years it says the law only allows it 
to correct errors caught within about 40 months of their occurrence

a briton who produced a bbctv 
documentary alleging that detained black youths were maltreated 
wont be allowed unrestricted access to south africa the 
government said thursday 
the home affairs department said nicholas claxton was no longer 
entitled to the exemption that enables british citizens to visit 
south africa without a visa 
claxton a freelance producer was commissioned by the british 
boradcasting corp to produce suffer the children a 
documentary shown in britain in june that alleged young blacks had 
been tortured and mistreated while in detention 
gerrie van zyl directorgeneral of home affairs said one of 
the reasons for the punitive action was that government officials 
had not been given a chance to view the documentary or comment on 
it prior to its broadcast 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said suffer the children 
was a despicable propaganda film which illustrated how lies 
distortions and exaggerations are being used agianst south africa 
to isolate it from the rest of the world 
vlok said police have been investigating the allegations made in 
the docuentary and have yet to find any evidence to support the 
charges 
human rights activists say several thousand black youths have 
been detained without charge for varying periods during the state 
of emergency declared in june 1986 
the government says no youths under 16 are in detention but it 
has not disclosed comprehensive figures 
the bureau for information is distributing a booklet defending 
the policy of detaining children saying some of these youths had

president reagans plan to pay humanitarian 
compensation to the families of the 290 people killed in the us 
destruction of an iranian jetliner last month faces serious hurdles 
in congress and may not be approved house members said thursday 
i think youre going to have serious trouble selling what 
youre trying to sell said rep ike skelton dmo told state 
and defense department officials 
skelton said the iranian government bears a heavy burden of 
responsibility for dispatching the iran air airbus into a persian 
gulf combat zone where it was destroyed by missiles from the us 
cruiser vincennes 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee told reporters that congress might be persuaded to 
appropriate funds for humanitarian compensation to the families if 
it is established that mistakes by the vincennes crew during combat 
caused the downing of the plane 
pentagon sources said wednesday that preliminary findings of an 
official investigation show that human error rather than 
malfunctioning equipment caused the vincennes to fire on the 
jetliner july 3 
aspin told state and defense department witnesses at the hearing 
that they face a tough sell in obtaining compensation funds 
from congress because the visceral reaction against the iranian 
government runs very deep 
aspin said the chances for approval of compensation would be a 
lot higher if there is an end to the eightyear iraniraq war and 
to attacks on international shipping in the gulf 
several committee members said they would oppose paying 
compensation unless there were absolute guarantees that the 
money would go only to victims families and not benefit the 
iranian government in any way 
while we want to be humanitarian we dont want to be naive 
said rep patricia schroeder dcolo 
aspin added unless there are absolute guarantees there are 
going to be absolute problems 
abraham sofaer the state departments legal adviser said the 
offer to pay compensation flows from a traditional american spirit 
of compassion and humanity 
he said all nations except the soviet union have paid 
compensation after the destruction of a civilian aircraft because 
civilized nations pay these kind of obligations 
safaer said he believes it would be inappropriate to link 
humanitarian payments to other issues such as the release of 
hostages held by iranianbacked radicals in lebanon 
this is not a nationtonation deal sofaer said this is 
a nationtopeople deal 
he said the united states will make every effort to ensure that 
tehran government does not benefit from the payments 
we are going to pay this money to people or were not going to 
pay it sofaer said 
he said however that cooperation from iranian authorities 
probably will be essential if the victims families are to be 
identified accurately and appropiate payment made 
he said that if there were no cooperation and survivors proved 
impossible to identify with certainty that likely would end the 
matter 
even with the administrations best efforts sofaer testified 
we will need a considerable amount of time to determine how to 
assess compensation and to obtain the information necessary from 
the families or their governments

there is compelling evidence moderate alcohol 
consumption increases the risk of breast cancer say doctors at 
harvard school of public health who analyzed 16 recent studies on 
the issue 
but another researcher said that in general the studies 
conducted so far suggest a very weak association at most and 
possibly none at all 
in addition another study suggests that women who drink 
moderate amounts of alcohol reduce their risk of heart attacks and 
a common form of stroke 
in an effort to make sense of conflicting findings in recent 
years doctors at harvard school of public health in boston pooled 
results of 16 studies dating to 1982 weighting each study 
according to their judgment of its quality 
the researchers found compelling evidence that breast cancer 
risk goes up with increasing alcohol consumption they reported in 
fridays journal of the american medical association 
however the findings do not prove alcohol causes breast cancer 
because association does not prove cause and effect and 
unknown factors may be responsible for the heightened risk said 
the researchers led by dr matthew p longnecker 
they also noted that one or two drinks a day shown to protect 
against heart or blood vessel disease may provide a benefit 
outweighing the increased risk of breast cancer 
the heightened breast cancer risk for moderate drinkers ranged 
from 14 times greater to 17 times greater than for nondrinkers 
the researchers said 
but dr randall e harris chief of epidemiology for the 
american health foundation in new york city said the harvard study 
contains no new data and it is somewhat arbitrary how you weight 
different studies 
he and colleague ernst l wynder cowrote a study in jama three 
months ago reporting on 1467 women with breast cancer and 10178 
women without who demonstrated no evidence that alcohol has a 
role in the genesis of breast cancer 
we havent changed our minds harris said in a telephone 
interview wednesday 
the jama analysis divided the studies into two groups depending 
upon how they were set up the harriswynder study was ranked ninth 
of 12 in its group 
the issue of breast cancer and alcohol in order to be 
resolved is going to rely on studies that prove or disprove a 
physiological mechanism harris said at present im not aware 
of such a mechanism 
in the meantime most women may want to choose whether to drink 
by weighing probabilities suggested dr william castelli director 
of the framingham heart study a 40year survey of thousands of 
subjects to explore the factors that may cause people to get heart 
disease 
he noted that while one in 25 women is expected to die of breast 
cancer about one in two is expected to succumb to heart or blood 
vessel disease 
youre way ahead of the game in trying to prevent the thing 
thats most likely to happen to you he said in a telephone 
interview wednesday from framingham mass 
but women whose risk of getting breast cancer is already known 
to be above average shouldnt drink at all he said 
women at greater risk for cancer include those with a strong 
family history of it those who have no children or who have had 
children after age 30 obesity and early onset of menstrual 
periods and late menopause 
there are probably better ways to prevent atherosclerosis 
fatty buildup in the arteries than by drinking it away

residents of one neighborhood are 
suffering a phenomenon they called cowgeist after the movie 
poltergeist but their problem isnt ghosts its houses 
sinking into mass cattle graves 
i just think its weird said homeowner ken zion it makes 
me upset im upset i bought a house that might be sinking into cow 
trenches 
the problem stems form an outbreak of hoof and mouth disease in 
the 1920s that wiped out nearly all of the dairy cattle in long 
beach said llewellyn bixby chairman of the bixby land co 
the dead cows were bulldozed into mass graves 
some of the burial trenches may be as deep as 18 feet said 
zion who said he received a settlement of several thousand dollars 
from the previous owner of his house after a corner of his garage 
started sinking six years ago 
eventually houses were built over the bovine burial site as 
houses were built over a cemetery in poltergeist as the 
carcasses decomposed the ground settled real estate agents said 
one agent said nine lots have suffered subsidence and one 
homeowner estimated that as many as 20 homes may be at risk 
land subsidence in long beach which was known in the 1950s as 
the sinking city is not unusual 
the problem then however was caused by oil wells pumping up 
crude oil from the western part of the city water was eventually 
injected into the ground to counter the effect 
kay coop an agent for jtm brokerage corp said one of her 
clients bought in the area without being told of the adverse 
effects from the cow cemetery 
it should have been declared said ms coop who would 
ever think to look for dead cows 
city planning director robert paternoster said no one had told 
him of of the problem senior deputy city attorney arthur honda 
said he also hadnt heard of the problem but said the city would 
not be liable for such an occurrence

usmediated negotiations among angola cuba and 
south africa on a peace settlement in southern africa are on 
track a us spokesman said thursday and the four countries 
agreed to extend the talks 
the negotiators agreed to end the meeting friday one day beyond 
the originally scheduled closing date sources close to the talks 
said 
art skop the mission spokesman said the negotiations are on 
track and the full agenda of issues is under discussion he 
declined to elaborate 
assistant secretary of state chester crocker who mediates the 
talks planned to give a news conference friday 
skops statement suggested that a controversy which arose 
earlier in the week over south african peace proposals had not 
derailed the negotiations 
the proposals were unexpectedly unveiled tuesday night in 
pretoria by foreign minister pik botha they called for a 
ceasefire by aug 10 in the 13yearold angolan war and made 
independence for southwest africa conditional on the withdrawal of 
cuban troops from angola by next june 1 
southwest africa also is known as namibia 
the cuban and angolan delegations in geneva rejected the 
proposals with cuba calling preposterous and unrealistic the 
two countries have said such a condition amounts to interference in 
their affairs 
cuba previously offered to pull its estimated 50000 troops out 
of angola over a fouryear period the troops have helped the 
marxist government fight unita the rebel movement of jonas 
savimbi which receives military aid from south africa and the 
united states 
in south africa botha said wednesday night that 
counterproposals were being discussed in geneva but he did not 
elaborate 
south africas public announcement of its proposals irritated 
crocker because the negotiating partners had earlier agreed to keep 
the talks confidential according to us sources 
the southern africa talks began in may in london and are in 
their fifth round the current round began on an upbeat note after 
a previous round july 20 in new york produced for the first time a 
joint document in which cuba angola and south africa accepted a 
set of 14 principles as a framework for a settlement 
on tuesday south africa also proposed to start withdrawing its 
estimated 50000 troops from namibia on nov 1 
south africas mandate over namibia was terminated by the united 
nations in 1966 but in defiance of several un security council 
resolutions it has retained control of the mineralwealthy country 
on thursday in luanda angola sam nujoma leader of the south 
west african peoples organization or swapo the main guerrilla 
group fighting for namibian independence charged that south africa 
had reinforced its troops in namibia recently he said this raised 
questions about the sincerity of the governments offer to withdraw 
south africa also called for the dismantling of seven guerrilla 
camps which it said were operated in angola by the african national 
congress the main black group fighting white rule in south africa 
the new york principles did not mention the ancs role nor 
those of unita or swapo which is reported to have bases in angola 
in pretoria president pw botha met on thursday with leaders 
of namibias multiracial interim government and gave assurances 
that they would be consulted about developments in the 
negotiations botha stressed that no agreement on independence for 
the territory had been reached 
dirk mudge a moderate white cabinet minister who headed the 
namibian delegation said after the meeting he hoped the 
international community would extend support to namibia if 
independence was obtained 
however the conservative national party of southwest africa 
the territorys largest white party reaffirmed its opposition to 
any settlement providing for oneman onevote elections 
only about 70000 of namibias 13 million people are white

a truck bomb exploded and killed at 
least three people in a crowded bazaar in kabul on thursday 
several hours before soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
arrived in the afghan capital 
staterun radio kabul monitored in islamabad said three 
passersby and the driver of the truck died and that 18 people were 
injured but the soviet news agency tass reported in moscow that 
only three people died and nine were injured both blamed the 
attack on moslem insurgents 
shevardnadzes visit which was not announced before tass said 
he had arrived in kabul came one day after he sharply criticized 
his pakistani counterpart yaqub khan during a meeting in moscow 
shevardnadze accused khans nation of international 
terrorism for its continued support of insurgents fighting the 
sovietbacked afghan government the alleged assistance is 
occurring as the soviet union withdraws its troops 
tass said in a twosentence report thursday that shevardnadze 
was met at the kabul airport by foreign minister abdul wakil and 
other afghan officials 
the dispatch said without elaborating that shevardnadze was on a 
working visit and that khan had left moscow to return to 
pakistan 
the soviet union has been increasingly critical of what 
shevardnadze called pakistans unceasing massive dispatches of 
arms to the guerrillas 
the afghanistan government also has made scores of complaints 
about what it says is pakistani assistance to the insurgents 
shevardnadze told khan that afghan guerrillas recently stepped 
up their bombardment of afghan towns and that hundreds of innocent 
people were killed or wounded in the past two months 
islamabads support for such actions cannot be described other 
than as international terrorism he told the pakistani official 
he said the soviet union and afghanistan would find ways to 
counter pakistans alleged interference but did not specify them 
the soviet union is withdrawing its force of more than 100000 
soldiers from afghanistan under the terms of an april 14 agreement 
signed in geneva by the soviet union pakistan afghanistan and the 
united states 
half the soviet soldiers are to withdrawn by aug 15 with the 
remainder out by feb 15 soviet and afghan officials say 35000 
already have left 
at a regular news briefing thursday soviet foreign ministry 
spokesman vadim perfiliev said all four parties should abide by the 
geneva agreement 
they have equal rights and of course if one side would 
continue violating the agreements the soviet union can take 
appropriate steps he said but i would like to emphasize that 
the measures the soviet union might take would be aimed at further 
implementation of the agreement we believe that geneva must work 
and that the settlement in afghanistan should continue 
radio kabul blamed afghan guerrillas allied with the 
hezbeislami party for the truck bomb guerrilla leaders and field 
commanders have denied planting explosives in residential areas of 
kabul or hitting them with rockets 
bombing and rocket attacks on kabul have increased since the 
soviet troop withdrawl began soviet soldiers entered afghanistan 
in december 1979 replaced one prosoviet government with another 
and remained to fight the insurgents soviet officials say more 
than 13000 of their soldiers died in the conflict

the communist party said thursday that two 
prominent bolsheviks were innocent of antisoviet activity and 
political mistakes the charges josef stalin used to destroy them 
in the 1930s 
the report on the work of a commission of the ruling politburo 
distributed by the tass news agency was not a political 
rehabiliation of bolshevik leaders grigory zinoviev or lev kamenev 
but it indicated such a move probably was not far behind 
tass said the commission had received a report from the soviet 
supreme court which has cleared the names of several old 
bolsheviks this year and that it was continuing its work 
the party under mikhail s gorbachev has sought to clear the 
names of its leaders purged by stalin in the 1930s to erase his 
legacy of repression and assure party members they wont be 
punished for speaking their minds 
in june the supreme court cleared zinoviev kamenev karl radek 
and grigory pyatikov of criminal charges of which they were 
convicted in the 1930s zinoviev kamenev and pyatikov were shot 
and radek died in a prison camp 
among the first bolshevik leaders to be cleared was nikolai 
bukharin who in february was declared innocent of the charges for 
which he was shot on july 9 the politburo committee posthumously 
readmitted him to the party 
his case was considered important because gorbachevs reforms 
follow many of the concepts bukharin developed 
zinoviev and kamenev are not so strongly identified with 
particular policies as was bukharin but along with vladimir lenin 
leon trotsky and stalin were leaders of the bolshevik party when 
it seized power in 1917 
after first teaming up with stalin to eliminate all opposition 
zinoviev and kamenev were themselves accused in 193233 of heading 
an underground group seeking to reestablish capitalism 
it has been established that the investigation of this affair 
was carried out with gross violations of the law the report said 
it said zinoviev and kamenev never were told what charges they 
faced and that the materials of the affair contain no evidence 
of antisoviet activity 
concerning their political and theoretical views laid out in 
the program documents they were of a discussion character and did 
not contain appeals to replace undermine or weaken soviet power 
the report said 
when bukharin was readmitted to the party last month the 
committee said he had made political mistakes but they did not 
justify the criminal charges against him or his exclusion from the 
party 
the commission report contained a lengthy list of lesserknown 
bolshevik officials who also were shot or sentenced to prison 
during stalins purges 
they were tried for alleged membership in subversive groups that 
stalinist prosecutors called the union of marxistleninists 
the moscow center antisoviet trotskyzinoviev center and 
the parallel antisoviet trotsky center 
the report said prosecutors falsified evidence in a 1935 trial 
in which zinoviev kamenev and 19 others were accused of forming 
the moscow center it said prosecutors alleged the moscow 
center was an underground terrorist group led by zinoviev that 
helped plan the 1934 assassination of sergei kirov the popular 
leningrad party leader 
the memoirs of anastas mikoyan a bolshevik leader who survived 
the purges were published last year and said that resentment of 
stalin led some communists to try to replace him with kirov at a 
1934 party conference 
some historians believe stalin himself was behind the killing of 
kirov and that the dictator then accused his political opponents 
of planning the assassination as an excuse to have them shot 
there have been no steps toward the rehabiliation of trotsky 
stalins first and most serious opponent for power after the death 
of lenin in 1924 although some historians have suggested it 
trotsky was thrown out of the communist party banished from the 
country and murdered in mexico city in 1940

calvin graham had a lump in his throat 
thursday and couldnt testify but house speaker jim wright made 
the case for the disabled world war ii hero who has been denied 
military benefits because he lied about his age and enlisted in the 
navy when he was 12 
from a narrowly legal point of view perhaps those who so long 
have thwarted efforts to restore simple justice to calvin graham 
may feel they were justified but on the basis of common sense 
ethics morality valor simple decency justice and fairness they 
were painfully wrong wright dtexas said 
the denial of full benefits to calvin graham brings a pall of 
shame over the government of the united states the speaker said 
as his wheelchairbound constituent sat at his side during a 
hearing by a house judiciary subcommittee 
when asked whether he wanted to testify on legislation to give 
him disability benefits and back pay graham 58 said ive got 
a lump in my throat right now 
graham of fort worth says patriotism was at a fevered pitch in 
1942 when weighing 125 pounds and standing at 5feet2 he joined 
the navy in houston and was assigned to the uss south dakota as an 
antiaircraft gun loader 
after shrapnel ripped through his mouth during the battle of 
guadalcanal graham said he remained aboard the ships deck 
applying tourniquets to those who had lost an arm or leg 
the military has fought graham at every turn since he was 
slammed in the brig in corpus christi texas upon his return from 
the pacific and it took the navy until 1978 to grant him an 
honorable discharge and award him his medals including the bronze 
star wright said 
in 1980 the government decided to give him 337 in back pay for 
the three months he spent confined in the brig and his 
musteringout benefits which would have been right amount at the 
time of his discharge in 1943 he was also granted disability 
status for one tooth although he said he lost all of his teeth 
because of war wounds 
legislation introduced by rep martin frost dtexas seeks to 
grant graham disability benefits for his mouth injuries and back 
pay in 1988 dollars with interest 
grahams story was the subject of a cbs television movie too 
young the hero earlier this year 
wright said the government has turned a cold shoulder to graham 
even though president roosevelt is said to have offered his help 
shortly before his death and president reagan in a california radio 
address during his campaign for the presidency described calvin 
grahams case as the kind of problem he wanted to address if 
elected so lets help him do it 
john thompson legal counsel for the veterans adminstration in 
response to questioning by rep barney frank dmass said he had 
not heard of any request from the administrtion to help graham 
thompson said there was no need for frosts bill 
graham rejoined the service when he reached the proper age and 
served with the marines during the korean war he said he broke his 
back and his right ankle when he lost his footing and fell from a 
pier in california and those injuries now keep him in a wheelchair 
i remember everything that happened to me that year like it 
was yesterday he said in an interview it burns in my mind i 
dream about it a lot

prime minister yitzhak shamir said thursday 
that israel will block the plo from taking jordans place in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
jordan said it will lay off or retire the 21200 palestinian 
employees of its institutions in the occupied territories which 
effectively turns over responsibility to the palestine liberation 
organization 
the action has the greatest practical effect of any taken since 
king husseins announcement sunday that he was cutting links with 
the territories where 15 million palestinians live 
shamir said jordans decision would put pressure on the plo 
and the palestinian arabs but would not change israeli policy 
we are still commited to our international obligations we 
will negotiate about peace with palestinians but never with the 
plo he told reporters 
king hussein wants to deliver these palestinians into the 
hands of the plo terrorists to struggle against israel for their 
socalled liberation 
rightwing israelis said shamir should take the opportunity 
presented by hussein to assert israeli claims to the west bank 
long live the king jewish settler eliakim haetzni said in 
an interview saluting with his right hand what happens now 
depends on our response israel must either turn this over to plo 
leader yasser arafat or annex it 
israel captured the west bank and gaza strip from jordan and 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
legislator geula cohen of the rightwing tehiya party met with 
shamir to press demands that israel annex the west bank to fill the 
power void left by jordan shamir rejected the proposal although 
his likud bloc believes the area is an inextricable part of the 
historic land of israel 
a foreign ministry spokesman said that if hussein was trying to 
encourage negotiations between israel and the plo he must 
understand clearly that for this option there is no israeli 
partner 
israel would object to the plo taking jordans place and 
paying salaries in the territories he said

conservative republicans said thursday that 
george bush is headed for defeat in november if he chooses a 
running mate from the gops establishment bluebloods 
bush the certain republican presidential nominee is weighing a 
number of choices for the tickets no 2 spot and has indicated he 
will wait until the gop convention in new orleans aug 1518 to 
announce his decision 
sen gordon j humphrey rnh chairman of the coalition for a 
winning ticket declined to single out the groups ideal vice 
presidential candidate but he did say conservatives were 
disappointed by the selection of gov thomas kean of new jersey as 
the conventions keynote speaker 
kean who has been mentioned as a possible bush running mate is 
from the partys moderate wing and like bush has an ivy league 
background 
the problem of the bush campaign is that it is attracted to 
establishment bluebloods what the bush ticket needs is a 
transfusion of red corpuscles from the conservative wing of our 
party humphrey said at a news conference 
humphrey said a number of other possible bush running mates from 
the partys moderate wing also were not acceptable to 
conservatives including richard thornburgh the former 
pennsylvania governor who has been chosen to succeed attorney 
general edwin meese iii gov jim thompson of illinois former 
tennessee gov lamar alexander and former tennessee sen and white 
house chief of staff howard h baker jr 
if george bush selects an establishment republican as his 
running mate we believe we are headed for a disaster in 
november humphrey said 
he described sen dan quayle of indiana rep jack kemp of new 
york and gov john sununu of new hampshire as acceptable to 
conservatives 
he was equivocal on other possible candidates including senate 
minority leader bob dole doles wife elizabeth hanford dole sen 
nancy kassebaum of kansas and sen alan simpson of wyoming he 
said however that conservatives would probably not be 
enthusiastic about them

at least one us city is seeing increased spinal 
cord injuries during the summer drought as swimmers dive into 
water thats not as deep as they think it is 
two spinal injury centers in milwaukee reported eight patients 
with neck and spinal cord injuries from diving into water june 1 to 
july 15 the national centers for disease control reported thursday 
that was up from three such injuries in the same period last 
year and five in the period in 1986 the cdc said 
this summers injured were males ages 15 to 23 one was hurt in 
a pool but the other seven were hurt diving into natural bodies of 
water all believed the water was deeper than it actually was 
the cdc said 
five of the seven were left with either partial or complete 
paralysis in both arms and both legs the other two suffered 
fractures but no residual neurologic problems 
this summers drought affecting most midwestern and many 
southern states has resulted in recordlow water levels in rivers 
lakes and streams the atlantabased cdc noted in its report 
these conditions probably increase the risk of spinal cord 
injuries from diving even in natural bodies of water previously 
considered safe 
for example the drought left wisconsins inland lakes 10 inches 
to 10 feet below normal the agency said 
because of extremely low water levels no one should dive 
even into a familiar body of water until the depth of the water 
has been objectively measured the cdc warned 
the cdc reported no current injury figures for the nation or for 
other cities however 10000 to 20000 spinal cord injuries occur 
in the united states each year with as many as 1000 from diving 
accidents the agency said 
several strategies for reducing such injuries have been 
suggested including the posting of warning signs during dry 
periods and campaigns to urge divers to check the depth of the 
water before diving in or at least jump feet first

it began with the condemning letter sent to a hometown 
preacher copies were circulated talk spread 
eventually it came before the denominations foreign mission 
board in richmond va investigators were sent abroad 
they interrogated the accused missionary quizzed associates 
the charges were scattergun he admitted one favoring womens 
ordination challenged others 
he was summoned to richmond questioned sent back then fired 
the process reflected the stiffened doctrinal grip of 
fundamentalists on the 147millionmember denomination although 
officials denied partisan pressures and insisted no purge of 
missionaries was going on 
it upset friends of the missionary the rev michael e willett 
dismissed for doctrinal ambiguity he holds a doctorate from 
southern baptist theological seminary in louisville where he once 
taught 
hes an excellent new testament scholar says the rev 
william link pastor emeritus of willetts home church in liberty 
mo who sought in vain to intervene in his behalf 
hes absolutely doctrinally sound hes being made a 
scapegoat 
defending the dismissal however the widely respected rev r 
keith parks head of the foreign mission board said the decision 
accorded with convictions of those of us who had to make it 
the board fields about 3800 foreign missionaries the largest 
professional missions force of any denomination theyre answerable 
to the board on which fundamentalists or biblical 
inerrantists now hold a majority 
parks was put in an impossible situation commented the rev 
harold songer veteran new testament scholar at the louisville 
seminary he was custer in indian country 
he couldnt let a great missionary enterprise be crucified on 
a toothpick 
the initial letter attacking willetts beliefs was written by a 
fellow missionary in costa rica the rev mike mcginnis to a 
minister in birmingham ala as copies circulated one soon reached 
the board 
parks sent investigators including j bryan brasington to 
costa rica where both mcginnis and willett were taking spanish 
courses before assignments in venezuela willett was questioned 
extensively 
he agreed to resign because of objections to his support for 
womens ordination which was discussed but he refused when 
brasington later wrote that the main charge was willetts lack of 
clarity about jesuss deity miracles and physical resurrection 
summoned to richmond willett was questioned in a closed 
session from which link and another supporter were excluded then 
with him back in costa rica the board at a july 2l meeting in 
glorieta n mex fired him 
now no missionary will feel safe from attack willett says 
in a statement summarizing his beliefs he affirmed the historic 
christian belief that jesus is god and man divine and humanin 
jesus of nazareth god has reached out to creation to the fullest 
extent as a human being 
jesus performed miracles through the power of the holy spirit 
proclaimed the kingdom of god died for our sins and was raised by 
the power of god the risen christ is still present in the world 
today offering salvation to those who place their trust in him 
willett says that jesus in his resurrection was transformed 
into a new level of existence with god to say that jesus 
spiritual body has flesh and bones like you and i have is to reduce 
the resurrection to a resuscitation 
about miracles of jesus willett said he accepts most of them 
but questions a few such as walking on water and changing water 
into wine as possibly expanded or created in the early church 
parks ascribed willetts dismissal to his doctrinal 
ambiguity particularly about some of jesus miracles 
songer a new testament scholar for 25 years at the 
denominations flagship seminary in louisville said willetts 
statement about miracles is a very common view in biblical 
scholarship as a whole 
its not common among southern baptists but not unheard of 
some of the older scholars are more inclined to such questioning 
historically there was more freedom to question openly than there 
is now 
as for jesus turning water into wine songer said some baptist 
scholars see it as allegorical rather than literal signifying 
the new joy spirit and forgiving wine of christianity but 
theres now a new breed of literalists 
he described the willett case as symptomatic of a current 
mood that sees only black or white no grays that cant allow 
any questions that demands either yes or no open or closed 
songer called it binary thinking adding theres a strong 
impact of computer technology in america these days that 
everything is either right or wrong without compassion or the 
grace of forgiveness 
calculators know no grays

fbi director william sessions said thursday he 
strongly favors random drug testing at his agency despite court 
challenges by other federal employees over the issue 
i think random testing has a significant role to play in the 
bureau sessions said at a news conference i think the bureau 
must be perceived as being a lawenforcement agency 
the fbi does not now randomly test employees for drug use 
although officials have drawn up a plan to initiate such testing in 
the future 
the entire plan has yet to be given final approval by officials 
at the justice department the fbis parent organization sessions 
said if approval is granted random drug testing could begin 
within three months 
sessions said the fbis plan would also allow employees to 
voluntarily submit to the tests to demonstrate their commitment 
against drugs 
but he said he does not know what effect a court ruling last 
week on a justice department drug testing program will have on the 
fbis plans 
us district court judge george h revercomb blocked the 
department for forcing about 1800 employees in sensitive 
positions from submitting to the random mandatory urine tests 
revercomb said the tests could infringe on the constitutional 
rights of the employees 
fortytwo department lawyers have filed suit against the plan 
two other drug testing cases one involving us customs service 
employees and another involving railroad workers are to be heard 
by the supreme court next week 
meantime the fbi has a program to test new recruits 
probationary employees and those workers suspected of using drugs 
sessions said as a result 13 people who worked at the agency or 
had applied for jobs have been terminated he said 
in other areas sessions said 
one fbi agent in each of the bureaus 58 field offices has been 
assigned to work with local state school and business officials 
to educate the public about the dangers of drugs 
he will discuss with members of congress early next month a 
report on the fbis investigation of a group opposed to president 
reagans central america policies 
reagans spokesman marlin fitzwater said in february that he 
was confident that the fbi did not conduct a massive spying 
campaign into the committee in solidarity with the people of el 
salvador members of congress have complained that the 
investigation was mishandled

the american public will get its first look at 
the new stealth bomber just after the presidential election and 
the plane will make its maiden flight a short time later the air 
force said thursday 
maj pat mullaney an air force spokesman said the stealth 
designated the b2 wont fly on the day of its public unveiling in 
california but preparations for flight will be very close to 
completion by then new planes often dont fly until several months 
after they are first presented to the public 
fred hoffman a pentagon spokesman denied thursday the planes 
unveiling purposely had been set for after the november elections 
democratic members of congress have cautioned the defense 
department not to make an electionyear issue out of the new 
bomber as was done with the b1b both democrat michael dukakis 
and republican george bush have said they support the new plane 
the bomber is an unusually short plane because of its unique 
flying wing design and will take only two personnel to fly 
reflecting the sophistication of the new technology that has gone 
into its development the service added the b52 bomber requires a 
crew of six and the new b1b bomber is flown by a crew of four 
the air force said in a statement the plane would be powered by 
four general electric co jet engines the engine dubbed the 
f118 will be a derivative of an existing ge powerplant and not 
any type of revolutionary new design the service said 
the air force offered those details about its newest bomber in 
announcing that final checkout activities on the first plane 
had begun and that assembly of a second was well along 
the b2 will roll out in midnovember at air force plant 42 in 
palmdale calif the statement said the exact date was not given 
the b2 has been under development for more than a decade under 
a shroud of secrecy with northrop corp as the prime contractor 
thursdays statement was only the second time the air force has 
disclosed information about the plane it released an artists 
sketch last april 
the stealth bomber takes its nickname from the fact it is 
designed to fly without showing up on radar 
it resembles a flying wing in shape without a conventional 
fuselage in the center a small cockpit bubble rises on top of the 
flying wing and inlets for the jet engines are placed to each side 
of the cockpit also on top of the wing 
the b2 will stand about 17 feet high 69 feet long and have a 
wingspan of about 172 feet the service said 
in addition to ge subcontractors included the boeing advanced 
systems co ltv aircraft products group hughes aircraft radar 
system group and honeywell 
the link flight simulation corp is responsible for aircrew 
training devices and the boeing military airplane co will build 
the b2s bomb and missile launcher system the service added 
while offering some new information the air force said thursday 
it still was not prepared to publish the current cost estimate for 
the stealth fleet 
published reports have suggested overruns have pushed the 
pricetag up more than 20 percent to about 450 million per plane

the senate on thursday confirmed the 
nomination of boston bank executive john p laware as a member of 
the federal reserve board 
the 903 vote approving lawares selection means that all seven 
seats on the board will be held president reagans appointees 
which has concerned congressional democrats 
earlier this year sen william proxmire dwis chairman of 
the banking committee hinted that he might try to delay lawares 
confirmation hearings so the vacancy could be filled by the next 
administration his panel eventually approved lawares nomination 
on thursday proxmire echoed his partys worries 
we hope and pray that mr laware and the other members of that 
board will recognize the importance of showing their independence 
of the fact that they were appointed by the same president he 
said 
at the same time proxmire praised laware 60 as very very 
well qualified 
senators who opposed lawares confirmation were democrats kent 
conrad of north dakota and albert gore jr and jim sasser of 
tennessee 
reserve board members are appointed to 14year terms and 
lawares term will not expire until jan 31 2002 the job pays

penalty that congress imposed on the portions of such arrangements 
that are considered excessive 
during confirmation hearings in july proxmire called the

astronomers are worried that commercial 
interests will create billboards in the heavens above to increase 
profits on the earth below 
stargazing is best when the skies are dark and pristine and 
astronomers attending the international astronomical union assembly 
here say their work is being harmed by an increasing number of 
satellites crisscrossing overhead 
most of the satellites are needed or unavoidable astronomers 
say but the iau is battling proposals for such things as orbiting 
advertising symbols or works of art or creating orbiting 
cemeteries overhead 
once we let it get started the next thing you know therell 
be golden arches up there astronomer david crawford said 
wednesday we have to keep an eagle eye out for this type of 
thing 
astronomers are concerned that what crawford calls the 
unproductive uses of space will block observations of the 
universe by groundbased telescopes and possibly damage astronomy 
instruments that will be launched into earth orbit 
crawford a kitt peak national observatory astronomer and 
sidney van den bergh an astronomer for the national research 
council of canada are on an international committee that is 
attempting to keep space free of frivolous uses 
among the proposals that worry them 
a group of artists in france wants to build a kitelike object 
the size of a football field and place it in orbit as an art 
object the work of art would be designed to catch and reflect the 
sunlight so it could be seen from earth 
astronomers are appalled van den bergh said 
celestis corp a melbourne fla company wants to orbit a 
satellite containing the cremated remains of 10300 people thus 
using space as sort of a mausoleum in the sky plans call for the 
satellite to be goldcoated so it would reflect sunlight enabling 
customers to look up and see the remains of their dead relatives 
pass overhead 
it would be like building cemeteries in wilderness areas on 
earth crawford said 
a plan to create an orbiting salute to the 100th birthday of the 
eiffel tower already has been canceled van den bergh said the plan 
called for launching a ring of 100 lights that would remind people 
of the century of the tower 
that would have been the first advertisement in space he 
said once that happens you dont know where it will stop 
van den bergh said such uses of space would add to the already 
serious light pollution problems astronomers are having in the 
study of the stars 
astronomers take thousands of star photographs a year most 
require long exposure times satellites orbiting past the field of 
view can ruin the pictures and perhaps obscure important 
discoveries 
astronomers are being bothered by this problem much more often 
than other people already a third of all the photo plates must 
be discarded because of satellites van den bergh said 
eventually though the crowded orbits of earth will be a 
problem for everybody as more and more uses are found for 
spacecraft he said 
the amount of stuff in earth orbit now is doubling every 
decade said van den bergh in a century all operations in 
near earth orbit will be extremely hazardous due to the 
possibility of collisions 
objects in orbit move at about 17000 miles an hour at that 
velocity even a dimesized object can cause great damage in a 
collision van den bergh said astronomers are worried about 
possible damage from space debris to the 15 billion hubble space 
telescope that will be launched next year by the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
a piece of space debris just an inch across would be enough 
to destroy the space telescope if it hits the right place he 
said

the entertainment industry prepared to return 
to work thursday after a 22week strike but the writers guild of 
america expressed some disappointment over its settlement with 
television and film producers 
hours after the tentative settlement was announced guild 
leaders complained publicly and privately that they had been forced 
by the intransigence of the alliance of motion picture and 
television producers to accept a number of contract compromises 
representatives for both sides said there can be no winners in a 
strike as long as this one which began march 7 and led to layoffs 
throughout hollywood and put the fall television season in chaos 
del reisman cochairman of the wga negotiating committee 
characterized parts of the settlement announced wednesday as 
damage control and said the wga decided monday that it had to 
bring in a deal and to do so soon 
another guild leader speaking on condition of anonymity said 
of the contract it was no home run 
nevertheless guild members are expected to ratify the contract 
sunday the writers say they can probably start work on a delayed 
fall tv season by next week giving viewers hope of relief from 
reruns 
guild leaders said they will tell writers at ratification 
sessions on both coasts that the terms reflect the best deal 
possible under the circumstances 
im a little bit more enthused about the deal than others 
are said arthur sellers a member of the wgas negotiating 
committee but was it worth it to me its an irrelevant 
question its like saying was world war ii worth it 
wga negotiator brian walton said late wednesday that the 
settlement was a significant improvement over a contract offer 
guild members overwhelmingly rejected june 16 
yet in some areas the new proposal contained just minor 
improvements in writers payments or residuals for television 
reruns considered the strikes key issue 
but guild leaders said they had changed the way hollywood does 
business and that the producers learned that the writers will not 
roll over 
the membership is going to look back at this strike with a 
great deal of pride sellers said the guilds credibility as a 
bargaining unit was enhanced the producers said we wouldnt get a 
nickel in foreign residuals well we did but a nickel is about 
all we got 
the guild won improvements in creative control over scripts and 
the reacquisition of original screenplays but gained very little 
in payments for television programs rebroadcast overseas 
we wound up with an equation that was actually less than most 
of us hoped for reisman said but it is the first improvement 
in 18 years 
the new formula links residual payments for television reruns to 
the sales of the show instead of paying a fixeddollar amount 
in exchange the writers can sometime during the life of the 
contract and if the syndication market improves submit to binding 
arbitration a request for a return to the existing fixed payment 
residual formula 
writers have been getting about 16000 for a onehour show 
under the new system that could drop to as little as 8000 for a 
show with weak syndication sales or increase to 24000 for a hit 
the likely amount for the average show is 12000 
writers will be able to choose between two formulas to collect 
payments for shows sold to foreign countries the existing system 
which pays a maximum of about 4400 for a onehour show or a new 
plan that would pay 12 percent of the producers foreign sales of 
a program as long as it is not less than 85 percent of the current 
residual or more than 130 percent of that figure 
the tentative proposal provides pay boosts of 5 percent in the 
first 18 months 5 percent in the next 18 months and 45 percent in 
the fourth year of the pact for all compensation under the 
agreement the deal includes the first industry contract for shows 
produced for basic cable television 
the guild has 9000 members most in southern california the 
alliance has 217 member companies responsible for 85 percent of 
network primetime television and 90 percent of feature film 
production and distribution

the internal revenue service said thursday it 
was asking charities for help in reminding contributors that they 
cant claim a full tax deduction for a gift if they get something 
in return 
under irs rules for example a taxpayer claiming a deduction 
for the purchase of girl scout cookies would have to subtract the 
value of the cookies from the amount they paid in order to arrive 
at the proper deduction 
in his notice to 400000 taxexempt charities irs commissioner 
lawrence b gibbs said he was concerned that sponsors of 
fundraising events have often failed to provide written 
information on deductibility 
the irs said the rule applies to fundraising activities such as 
charity balls bazaars banquets auctions concerts athletic 
events and solicitations for membership or contributions when 
merchandise or another benefit is received in return 
the house budget committee last year directed the irs to monitor 
the efforts of charity groups to inform contributors

railroad workers walked off their jobs thursday 
after the morning rush hour was over to protest massive layoffs by 
management and then returned a few hours later in time for the 
evening rush after congress intervened 
its over and were ready to try to find an agreement said 
fred bloedorn spokesman for chicago amp north western transportation 
co 
under terms of the congressional action the railroad reinstated 
1156 brakemens jobs it says are unnecessary the railroad said 
those positions would be secure until the end of a 36day 
coolingoff period or in the event of a settlement to the 
longstanding dispute 
the company and union said they expected quick presidential 
approval of the congressional measure and declared the strike over 
without waiting for the formality president reagan later signed it 
into law at about 130 edt said rep terry bruce who attended the 
billsigning at the white house 
bruce and sen paul simon dill both negotiated a compromise 
that delayed the strike originally scheduled for shortly after 
midnight until after the morning rushhour 
delaying the walkout spared 41000 commuters the incovenience of 
having to find another way to work 
during the coolingoff period the union may not strike and the 
company cannot eliminate jobs said bruce 
the dispute centers on a campnw plan to adopt new work rules 
cutting the size of most of its train crews from four to two 
workers a move the union vigorously opposes 
united transportation union president fred hardin said he was 
optimistic a settlement to the dispute could be reached before 
sept 9 when the coolingoff period ends 
i think it can be if both parties will negotiate in good 
faith hardin said 
in addition to its commuter services the railroad moves freight 
on 6400 miles of track in 10 midwestern states the strike by 
2600 utu members would have snarled freight traffic in those 
states and likely would have idled 7500 unionized campnw workers 
all of the utu workers for campnw walked out except for the 
operators of commuter and freight trains that were in transit when 
the strike was declared bloedorn said 
just two hours later members of the house of representatives 
unanimously approved a measure delaying the strike until sept 9 
said david carle a spokesman for simon 
the house acted quickly to avoid disruption of service to 
chicagoarea commuters said rep thomas a luken dohio chairman 
of the house energy and commerce committees transportation 
subcommitte 
moreover the loss of rail service in parts of the midwest 
will cause significant hardships for farmers trying to get their 
grain to market in these very difficult times he said 
union workers briefly picketed campnws downtown chicago terminal 
but some with reluctance 
its taken up way too much time for for both parties said 
michael boykin 35 a freight foreman and 14year veteran of the 
company if theyd really wanted to both parties could have 
reached an amicable agreement

iranian gunboats fired machine guns at a 
norwegian supertanker thursday shipping executives said in the 
first reported shooting incident in the persian gulf since iran 
agreed to negotiate a truce with iraq 
but iran quickly denied involvement in the ship raid instead 
saying it was probably the work of those who are opposed to peace 
in the region no injuries were reported 
iran said another 1000 civilians were injured in iraqi chemical 
bomb raids raising the number to 2700 in two days and it urged 
the united nations security council to condemn such attacks 
the official iraqi news agency meanwhile said without 
elaborating that iraqi warplanes raided two iranian oil pumping 
facilities 
at the united nations on thursday secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar and security council members tried to break a 
deadlock over a ceasefire resolution iran and iraq have accepted 
the talks have bogged down over iraqs demand for direct talks with 
iran before the ceasefire is set 
also thursday a leader of the rebels fighting ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeinis rule was publicly hanged in iran and another 
surrendered to government forces the official islamic republic 
news agency said 
the report said the executed man was a leader of the mujahedeen 
khalq or peoples holy warriors an iraqibacked rebel group the 
prisoner was identified by the news agency only as a rebel 
commander 
gulfbased shipping executives said the tanker attack appeared 
to be an isolated one and did not mean a resurgence in the gulfs 
tanker war the executives who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said iranian gunboats opened fire after the tanker the 
berge lord defied demands to stop for inspection 
no injuries and only minor damage was reported aboard the 
284502ton berge lord which continued out of the gulf with a 
cargo of saudi arabian crude oil 
the encounter involving an estimated six iranian gunboats 
occurred near abu musa island in the southern gulf a base for 
irans speedboats 
in an unusual move iran quickly disavowed the shooting and 
suggested that any such attack would be designed to undermine the 
current un peace effort 
the islamic republic news agency said an unidentified military 
official at general command headquarters refuted reports that 
iranian gunboats had attacked a norwegian tanker in the persian 
gulf 
irna quoted the official as saying iranian gunboats have never 
had and do not have such missions and probably the attack if 
it really took place has been carried out by those who are against 
a stable peace in the region and are hampering implementation of 
un resolution 598 
iran never has officially acknowledged its gunboat raids on 
neutral shipping in the gulf and veteran observers could not 
recall a previous denial 
some gulf shipping executives said the iranians apparently fired 
only warning shots at the norwegian tanker which was the 
victim of an iranian gunboat attack in the strait of hormuz in 
march 
the ships master sent a mayday distress call it prompted 
immediate fears that the tanker war in which more than 500 
ships have been damaged and 350 seamen killed in the past eight 
years had resumed 
iran announced july 18 it would accept a unsponsored 
ceasefire in its 8yearold war with iraq since then iraq which 
accepted the resolution when it was adopted a year ago has not 
conducted air raids on iranian oil tankers iran also has refrained 
from attacking commercial tankers during that time 
iran however has continued to stop and inspect neutral ships 
in the southern gulf in search of iraqrelated cargo such 
activity by a belligerent is legal under international maritime law 
also thursday iran said that 1700 civilians were now reported 
injured in an iraqi chemical bomb attack tuesday in the town of 
oshnaviyeh in the northern province of west azerbaijan in another 
attack wednesday on villages west of oshnaviyeh another 1000 
villagers were injured the agency reported 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati said in letter to perez de

panamanian ambassador juan sosa said thursday 
there are indications military ruler gen manuel noriega may want 
to negotiate with ousted president eric arturo delvalle to whom 
sosa is loyal 
the ambassador said delvalle who has been in hiding in panama 
has received a written message from noriega but no negotiations 
are under way 
sosa said delvalle whom the reagan administration recognizes as 
president of panama has always been willing to negotiate for a 
return of democracy to panama 
he said he did not believe delvalle has met with a noriega 
emissary as reported in thursdays editions of the miami herald 
the newspaper quoted sources close to delvalle and quoted former 
noriega aide jose blandon as saying the ousted president was 
preparing a document on his willingness to negotiate 
sosa said in a telephone interview that noriega sent a proposal 
for a dialogue last month shortly before delvalle slipped 
temporarily into miami for a medical checkup 
sosa said the embassy in washington has had no contact with 
noriegas government in panama city and maintains itself with funds 
withheld from noriega sosa said he has a staff of five other 
diplomats a receptionist and a chauffeur 
roberto leyton the panamanian ambassador to the organization of 
american states here is loyal to noriega 
delvalle dismissed noriega as defense chief feb 25 but was 
ousted the following day by the noriegadominated national assembly

negative preoccupation with mental health 
treatment could hurt the nation by discouraging public officials 
who need help from seeking it an official of the american 
psychological association said thursday 
it makes it impossible for key decisionmakers including the 
president whose finger is on the nuclear trigger to receive 
appropriate and preventive psychological care at times of personal 
crisis dr bryant l welch told a news conference 
the issue was thrust into the spotlight this week by rumors 
originating with associates of political extremist lyndon larouche 
that democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis had 
undergone treatment for depression 
that has been denied by dukakis and his personal physician and 
president reagan said he shouldnt have made a joking comment 
wednesday that dukakis was an invalid 
all people including elected officials no matter how 
healthy are psychologically unstable during times of personal 
crisis these crises can involve the loss of a loved one a serious 
physical illness or other traumatic event said welch the apas 
executive director for professional practice 
professional treatment can help people through those events and 
seeking such treatment is not an indication of any underlying 
mental illness welch said 
unfortunately in the current climate there is no question 
that public officials are being discouraged from seeking 
psychological care for fear the very fact of seeking care will 
subject them to being labeled mentally ill and unfit for public 
service welch said 
whether an individual can stand up under pressure is a 
legitimate question welch said but i dont think having had 
psychological care is a good predictor of that 
past presidents have suffered from serious bouts of depression 
notably abraham lincoln and andrew jackson welch said 
he also expressed concern about the insistence on candidates 
releasing raw medical records commenting that such information 
could be subject to misunderstanding and political demagoguery 
information on physical and mental condition is important for 
voters he said but should be explained by physicians rather than 
simply making medical records public 
asked if merely talking with a friend in times of stress 
constitutes treatment welch said that could be beneficial but he 
would not consider it to be treatment 
im not saying one should always see a mental health 
specialist every time they undergo a life crisis he said

a computer spotted a valve problem 
and scrubbed nasas test firing of space shuttle discoverys 
engines in the final second thursday dealing another setback to 
americas 2year effort to return to space 
engineers said it will be three to seven days before they can 
try the test again the postponement was the fifth in two weeks and 
made it almost certain that discoverys flight will be delayed from 
late september into october 
thats why we have flight readiness firings to work the bugs 
out of equipment before we launch said james fletcher the 
administrator of the national aeronautics and space administration 
no american has been launched into space since the shuttle 
challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff jan 28 1986 killing 
seven crew members 
the problem thursday either was a valve that didnt close as 
fast as it was supposed to or a sensor that gave a wrong reading of 
the valves openclosed position 
we dont know whether it was a faulty indication or really a 
malfunction in the valve said joseph a lombardo engine program 
director at nasas propulsion facility in mississippi 
engineers were looking at the possibility that the sensor might 
have been affected by long exposure to the extreme cold of the 
liquid hydrogen fuel the tanks were loaded for 10 hours four 
hours longer than normal so that special tests could be run on the 
fuel system 
to remain liquid hydrogen must be kept at 423 degrees below 
zero 
boyce mix engine manager at nasas mississippi engine test 
facility said historically some sensors are more 
temperaturesensitive than others 
as the tanks were being drained he said the valve was tested 
and it worked sluggishly the first time but normally after it 
warmed up 
the computer which controls all operations in the final 31 
seconds of a launch countdown received an indication that the 
valve still was partially open which would allow highpressure 
gases to enter areas unable to accommodate them possibly causing a 
rupture and explosion the computer reacted as it was supposed to 
the actual start commands to the engine were never given 
lombardo said the incident that occurred was not that we had a 
start failure of the main engines but that we had a failure to 
start 
if the sensor is at fault lombardo said a change in computer 
commands might be a way around the problem swapping out the sensor 
and the valve could take three days to a week said john j talone 
who manages scheduling for discovery 
we just dont have all the answers this early lombardo said 
the valve operated perfectly in earlier tests but sluggishness 
is what we determined today he said 
during the test the shuttle is secured to the pad by bolts 
three inches in diameter and three feet long the two solid booster 
rockets that flank the orbiter and the huge fuel tank are not fired 
in the test 
if all had gone well the shuttles three main engines should 
have fired for 20 seconds the major test before committing a 
shuttle to flight two of the engines including the one with the 
valve problem had not flown before the third had been used on 
four missions 
at least two days is required to drain more than a halfmillion 
gallons of fuel from the shuttle tank and to refill them but 
talone said an extra day was added to the minimum time to give 
crews a rest 
in the past two weeks officials had made four other attempts to 
prepare the shuttle for the flight readiness test all failed 
because of faults in the ground servicing equipment 
nasa had hoped to launch discovery in late september but even 
before the test abort many officials believed the launch would 
slip into october because of earlier delays and an unresolved gas 
leak in a steering engine system that is separate from the main 
engines 
launch director bob sieck has said each day of delay in the 
firing test would move back the launch by one day 
among the disappointed observers thursday were two of the five 
astronauts slated to fly discovery navy capt rick hauck and 
marine lt col dave hilmers 
although we were disappointed todays test did not go full 
term we were impressed with the professional manner in which the 
launch team responded to the situation hauck said in a 
statement distributed by nasa 
the shuttle program also must pass another key propulsion test 
before discovery is okd for flight a fullscale firing the fifth 
in a series of the redesigned solid fuel booster rocket at the 
morton thiokol plant in utah it is scheduled for aug 20

troops moved into rangoon on thursday 
to stop thousands of masked teenagers from demonstrating in 
defiance of the burmese governments martial law decree diplomats 
and returning tourists reported 
heavy monsoon rains lashed the crowds soldiers fired warning 
shots but no violence was reported 
diplomats in rengoon described the demonstrations as the largest 
against the militarydominated regime since student riots earlier 
this year 
both the students and military seem to be trying to avoid 
confrontation but the situation is fluid tense and dangerous 
one diplomat said 
protesters most of them high school students shouted demands 
for democracy the ouster of president sein lwin and freedom for 
dissidents the former general has jailed since assuming power last 
week he declared martial law wednesday after students held 
peaceful street demonstrations 
separate large protests began simultaneously at midday thursday 
the diplomats reported speaking on condition of anonymity 
they said the total number of protesters was not known but about 
10000 gathered at the sule pagoda in the heart rangoon and 
soldiers fired warning volleys into the air most in the crowd were 
youngsters with their faces covered so authorities could not 
identify them according to the diplomats 
west european tourists interviewed after arrival in bangkok said 
they saw armored personnel carriers and jeeps armed with machine 
guns cruising the streets soldiers guarded the city hall national 
assembly building and other sites 
reports from diplomats said the heavy rain thinned some crowds 
but by late afternoon a throng had gathered at rangoon university 
a center of protest four miles north of the city they said about 
25 truckloads of soldiers were at the campus 
italian tourist otta violavaggi said about half the stores in 
downtown rangoon closed after wednesdays demonstrations which 
authorities said led them to declaring martial law in the city of 
35 million 
everybody was very anxious nobody knows what to do said 
christine jacobs of brussels belgium tourists said they were told 
they would be arrested if they took photographs 
several burmese said a general strike would be held monday the 
tourists said quoting the informants as saying the date was chosen 
because eight is an auspicious number and monday is the eighth day 
of the eighth month of 1988 
other rangoon residents reached by telephone said protesters 
dispersed after several trucks full of soldiers arrived at a 
government office building near the sule pagoda a shrine said to 
be more than 2000 years old and believed to house relics of the 
lord buddha 
crowds gathered around the colonialstyle red brick office 
building and shouted antigovernment slogans 
rangoon radio monitored in bangkok said after martial law was 
declared wednesday that it was necessary to maintain security 
safeguard property and allow students who so desire to study 
peacefully it said directives might be issued for summary trials 
the diplomats said there was no curfew but few residents were 
seen on the streets after the martial law decree tourists said it 
was hard to get a restaurant meal wednesday night 
sein lwin 64 was elected president of burma and chairman of 
the ruling socialist program party last week replacing ne win who 
stepped down after ruling burma for 26 years pamphlets circulated 
in rangoon call him a ruthless oppressor who must be overthrown 
since sein lwin assumed power authorities have arrested several 
dissidents and others including the countrys most respected and 
vocal critic of the system aung gyi and associated press 
correspondent sein win they have been accused of attacking the 
state 
foreign journalists have followed developments by telephone and 
by monitoring official media because of restrictions on their entry 
to rangoon the only legal gateway to burma for most outsiders 
foreign reporters usually entered the country in the past on 
tourist visas issued at burmese embassies

these are supposed to be the dog days of the 
presidential campaign when the candidates rest between conventions 
and the voters vacation but in this summers record heat the 1988 
race is turning mean 
a month before the traditional labor day kickoff for the fall 
campaign democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis has 
already taken a hard shot the news was filled with stories about 
rumors that he did or didnt have psychiatric treatment 
this was more than just the usual jabbing at your opponent that 
is part and parcel of the political wars 
it was a nasty trick an effort to raise doubts about the 
stability and sanity of a presidential candidate without a single 
fact to back up the rumors 
the democratic presidential nominee and his doctor firmly denied 
the rumors on wednesday and now the democrats are pointing the 
finger at the republicans as the ultimate source 
theres something significant about what the republicans have 
done here said new york gov mario cuomo on thursday the fact 
that they would use lyndon larouche to get this thing started the 
fact that they would get negative that they would get so 
irrelevant so early 
democratic party chief paul kirk said the republicans are 
practicing the politics of desperation 
if theres been any negative campaigning its coming from one 
side he said thursday they have nothing positive to say about 
the future 
the only fingerprints on the rumors are those of larouche a 
political extremist whose supporters have handed out fliers 
spreading the dukakis rumors but other news organizations have 
reported hearing the same sort of talk from republican sources and 
even from white house officials 
and president reagans fingerprints are on the making of the 
rumors into news 
asked by a larouche supporter about the matter reagan made a 
crack wednesday about dukakis as an invalid then he said he 
shouldnt have said that that his joke had fallen flat 
but what he had said had been enough the president had dealt 
with the issue in front of the cameras and dukakis felt he had to 
step forward and deny the rumors personally 
now the question is will the mudslinging continue or will the 
tone of the campaign improve dramatically 
bush and his fellow republicans have the major opportunity in 
the next two weeks to set the tone the indications are their 
message will be a tough one 
his campaign officials have outlined a program through the 
republican convention of sharp attacks on dukakis and his record 
thursdays theme was defense and bush himself said dukakis is 
for unilateral disarmament a favorite charge aimed at painting 
a liberal as weak on defense 
former presidential hopeful jack kemp added his blast in a 
chicago speech saying dukakis is not a kennedy democrat he is a 
liberal democrat of the mcgovern era 
these attacks are to continue with reagan playing a role in his 
appearence on the opening night of the gop convention in new 
orleans 
that strategy can hurt dukakis said pollster andrew kohut of 
the gallup organization 
they can use the dreaded l word kohut said they can 
make dukakis out to be a liberal 
but there are dangers for the republicans in this strategy 
one is that voters will find it all too negative and too boring 
the democrats tried to avoid that danger at their atlanta 
convention by using humor making fun of bush with sen edward 
kennedy asking where was george and keynote speaker ann 
richards talking about bshs being born with a silver foot in his 
mouth 
the other danger is that the american people would never get a 
chance to hear the positives about bush amid all the 
dukakisbashing 
democratic chief kirk said bush has been running against the 
1970s and trying to apply labels to governor dukakis that have no 
bearing i havent heard any dialogue about where we go 
about the future of this country 
pollster kohut said the republicans have to spend more time 
talking about bushs positives than about dukakis negatives bush 
is widely recognized by the public but poll after poll has shown 
that the voters dont really know much about him 
the republican convention and bushs acceptance speech in 
particular are prime opportunities for bush to introduce himself 
to america and to put forward a positive vision for the country 
he has to do exactly what dukakis did kohut said he has 
to make himself more human the voters want a leader and a 
human being 
in atlanta dukakis didnt do any bushbashing in his acceptance 
speech taking the time to lay out his own themes and his own ideas 
for the nation 
cuomo in poking fun at bush made the point clearly that the 
republican nominee has a case to make 
hes a nice man hes a good american but theres no 
rationale for george bush said cuomo there is no case for 
george bush he was a terrific first baseman for yale hes 
tall 
in the meantime the tone of campaign 88 has turned sharp and 
sour perhaps signaling a long and difficult fall to come

success was within the grasp of the 
tired group of space shuttle launch controllers they had been 
frustrated by two lessthansuccessful practice counts in a week 
and now they were seconds away from a vital test firing of shuttle 
discoverys engines 
8765 the clock ticked away then stopped 
a computer had sensed a problem with an engine valve thursday 
and withheld an ignition signal the test was put off at least 
three days 
just a month ago on july 4 the workers at the kennedy space 
center had been energized when at long last after months of delay 
discovery was transported to the launch pad 
several thousand turned out at midnight to cheer discovery as it 
moved in the glare of spotlights nearly 20000 including 
families took advantage of a rare open house to drive their cars 
past the launch pad later that day to proudly view the shuttle 
sitting majestically on launch pad 39b 
this is what were here for they said to launch vehicles into 
space now 2 years after the challenger disaster and the death of 
its seven astronauts they had a shuttle on the pad the launch was 
set for early september 
since then its been one disappointment after another 
on july 15 engineers detected a small leak in a gas line in a 
steering engine compartment engineers came up with a scheme to 
reach the offending fitting but that would mean about a twoweek 
launch postponement 
they would do the repair after the main engines were test fired 
but before that countdown could begin they had to conduct a 
practice count in which discoverys external fuel tank was to be 
filled with half a million gallons of propellant 
fueling began last friday but was quickly scrubbed because of a 
hydrogen leak in ground support equipment the leak was fixed and 
another count begun on sunday another hydrogen leak cropped up 
nasa decided to complete the test skipping several planned fuel 
tests with a partial load 
the countdown was completed but technicians could not find the 
leak so they changed all the seals and fittings in the suspect 
area 
on wednesday night the count resumed for the test firing 
considered critical for certifying discovery for flight 
all night long the count was perfect fueling was completed on 
time there were no leaks and the team was well ahead of schedule 
then the bitter disappointment when the valve closed too slowly 
or a sensor gave a wrong reading and the computer called a halt 
it appeared almost certain the launch would slip into october 
has the morale of the launch team been shattered 
to tell you the truth these are professional people said 
john talone discoverys schedule flow director there is a 
certain amount of frustration because we thrive on doing these 
things completely and getting them done when things dont work as 
well its just a challenge but theyre ready to come back 
tomorrow and i dont see any morale effect of it

the groans of a beaten us drug agent and 
his pleas for his familys safety were heard in federal court 
thursday as prosecutors played tapes of the slain agents 
interrogation by his abductors 
at one point enrique camarena is heard asking if he can bandage 
his broken ribs the request is ignored 
with the beating you have given me do you think that i am 
going to lie to you camarena asks at one point 
the tapes which run nearly two hours depict an apparently 
exhausted camarena answering questions in a monotone disclosing 
confidential drug enforcement administration information in an 
effort to safe his life 
dont hit me any more camarena declares several times 
no the interrogator replies calmly no one will hit you 
but later in the tape camarena is heard moaning in pain 
the actual torture the prosecution says he endured was not on 
the recordings 
camarena was abducted in guadalajara on feb 7 1985 as he was 
leaving the american consulate to have lunch with his wife his 
body and that of his pilot alfredo zavala avelar were found 
buried at a remote ranch in mexico several weeks later they had 
been severely beaten and camarenas skull was shattered 
three mexican nationals are on trial in the crimes which the 
government claims were orchestrated by mexican drug kingpin rafael 
caro quintero 33 who is imprisoned in mexico he and two other 
men are being tried for the crimes there 
in testimony following the playing of the tapes dea agent dale 
stinson identified the voices of camarenas interrogators as caro 
and sergio espinosa verdin a former mexican federal police 
commander 
rene verdugo urquidez 36 and raul lopez alvarez 28 are 
charged with the murders of camarena and zavala also charged is 
jesus felix gutierrez 38 who allegedly helped caro escape in 
mexico after the killing 
only one defendant verdugo was mentioned in passing on the 
tapes which prosecutors say were made at an estate in guadalajara 
the muffled tapes were played in a darkened courtroom with 
jurors watching a transcript of the words projected on a screen 
most of the interrogation focused on the identity of dea 
informants in mexico camarena named two and gave information on 
where they lived he also gave directions to the home of another 
dea agent in mexico 
i am saying this to you because well dont hurt my family 
please camarena is heard saying in a quiet voice 
no one is going to hurt your family forget about that says 
the interrogator they are not to blame for anything you 
just keep on remembering that is all i am not going to hit 
you or anything ok 
large portions of the tapes center on the interrogators efforts 
to find out how much camarena knew about caro camarena claimed he 
knew little that he couldnt find out where caro lived and was 
hampered because american agents were not allowed to carry firearms 
in mexico 
at that the interrogator snapped dont tell me about your 
problems speak of the information you can give us you can provide 
us to finish with this bunch of jerks 
yes sir camarena said in a weak voice what more can i 
tell you sir 
toward the end of the tape camarena is heard moaning and crying 
out in pain 
i am not going to hit you the interrogator assures him 
no it was that i am getting sharp pains says the agent 
who is ignored 
couldnt i ask you to have my ribs bandaged please 
camarena asks that too is ignored

michael dukakis campaigned in rural 
mississippi on thursday and said his promise of economi change 
would deliver opportunity to all no matter who they are or where 
they come from or what the color of their skin 
visiting near one of the civil rights battlegrounds of the 
1960s the democratic presidential nominee made only brief 
reference to that struggle for equality for blacks 
but he did say here in mississippi you know the importance 
of equal rights and civil rights today i say to all americans 
not just in neshoba county but all over america weve got to work 
together weve got to work together to bring down the barriers to 
opportunity for all our people 
dukakis spoke to a noontime crowd at the neshoba county fair 
where a crowd filled a grandstand and many more sat in lounge 
chairs on the red dirt of a horse track in front of the covered 
podium the mostly white audience was estimated at 6000 to 7000 
people by sheriff glen waddell 
the appearance was loaded with symbolism as the neshoba fair 
was the place where ronald reagan kicked off his campaign as the 
republican presidential nominee eight years ago nearly to the day 
dukakis has directed much of his campaign efforts since winning the 
nomination at attracting the support of independent and democratic 
voters who supported reagan in the past two elections 
at the same time he was campaigning in a state where he lost 
the democratic primary to jesse jackson 
the rural region of eastcentral mississippi was the scene of 
one of the dark incidents of the civil rights struggle the 1964 
slaying of three civil rights workers an episode that jackson 
frequently recalled in his campaign speeches 
dukakis didnt note in his remarks that the three mens bodies 
were found 24 years ago thursday asked about that later he said 
i talked about economic opportunity because thats the most 
important single thing that concerns people 
mississippi was the first stop on a threeday campaign trip that 
followed a day in boston spent dealing with news accounts about 
rumors that dukakis had undergone psychiatric treatment no 
substantiation for the rumors has been presented and dukakis and 
his doctor said wednesday he had never undergone psychiatric 
treatment or counseling of any kind 
dukakis received a friendly greeting from the hot and dusty 
crowd although some in the audience waved signs supporting 
republican george bush one sign said liberal go home 
in his 1980 visit reagan declared his support for states 
rights and a restoration of powers to state and local governments 
dukakis in his remarks made no reference to reagan 
he repeated his broad calls for investment in schools and 
industrial revitalization to produce more and better jobs he 
referred to mississippi as a state thats hurting 
we can settle for what lloyd bentsen calls a swiss cheese 
economy dukakis said using his running mates term to describe 
a nation marked by pockets of economic hard times 
or we can go to work and build an economic future for this 
country that will create good jobs at good wages for every citizen 
in this land no matter who they are or where they come from or 
what the color of their skin dukakis said 
we have to work together to see that every citizen and every 
child born in this country is an equal shareholder in the american 
dream he said 
appearing with dukakis were local officials including democratic 
gov ray mabus who was elected last year 
dukakis also cited democratic sen john stennis who has held 
his seat for 40 years and said you cant tell me that 
mississippi isnt going to vote for mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen 
this fall 
dukakis repeated his criticism of the mililtary contracts 
scandal saying were going to throw the dishonest contractors 
and the wheeler dealers out of the pentagon once and for all 
dukakis met with local elected officials and some former 
supporters of jackson aboard a bus during the hourlong ride from 
the meridian airport to the fairgrounds outside philadelphia 
his visit to mississippi was the first stop on a hurried 
campaign swing that takes him to the west coast and back to boston 
in three days aides said much of the trip would be devoted to 
stressing the themes of protecting the environment and fragile 
coastal areas highlighted by a scheduled appearance just off the 
pacific coast highway at laguna beach calif

a newspaper reported thursday that 82 elite blue 
beret paratroopers were arrested for going on a drunken rampage 
after a celebration of a military holiday 
moscow police stations resembled a war front as officers 
brought the drunken soldiers in tuesday night said the report in 
moskovsky komsomolyets published by the moscow young communist 
league

a wall street credit rating firm suspended 
the citys bond rating thursday crippling the citys borrowing 
power on the third day of fines imposed when city council rejected 
a housing desegregation plan 
we cant borrow money interim city manager neil deluca said 
after moodys investors service inc suspended its rating of 
yonkers bonds no corporation can function without the ability 
to borrow money 
a federal judge began fining the city tuesday after city council 
failed to support his plan to build low and middle income housing 
to remedy housing and school segregation 
the fines began at 100 on tuesday and double each day 
in a statement moodys said the suspension was due to 
uncertainties resulting from daily fines imposed by the federal 
court those uncertainties derive foremost from the potential for 
extraordinary disruption of operations 
moodys said the fine schedule would deplete the citys reported 
aug 3 cash reserve of 663 million by aug 22 
another credit rating firm standard amp poors corp said it was 
monitoring the situation thursday and took no action on its 
yonkers rating 
yonkers the states fourthlargest municipality with a 
population of nearly 200000 has been in a legal tugofwar with 
us district judge leonard sand since 1985 when he found the city 
liable for intentionally segregating housing and schools during a 
40year period yonkers is just north of new york city 
city council on monday voted 43 against endorsing a package of 
bonuses financial incentives and zoning variances to attract 
developers to build the housing 
everybody seems to be doing the same thing waiting for the 
other guy to move deluca said the judge the council the 
governor the control board we cant get the city council to 
change its vote and we cant get the judge to change his ruling and 
were going bankrupt 
the judge has suggested that gov mario cuomo step in to help 
resolve the crisis either by removing the four councilmen who 
voted against the judges plan or through the staterun emergency 
financial control board which oversees city spending the four 
councilmen are paying daily fines of 500 
the control board however postponed a meeting slated for 
thursday and cuomo said he was reluctant to get involved 
the governor said im not going to allow any damage to occur 
that i can prevent but he told new york radio station wcbsam 
that action has to be taken by the city council in the first 
place these people were elected 
he said it was not the best way to deal with these matters to 
have the power come down from the state capitol to throw an elected 
official out of office i dont like disrupting the system 
the city has asked the us 2nd circuit court of appeals to 
block the contempt finding and the fines while it appeals the 
judges action 
secretary of state gail shaffer urging the city council to meet 
before tuesday and get the city out of contempt outlined possible 
actions the control board can take should the city fail to act 
those actions include imposition of a wage and hiring freeze a 
halt of discretionary spending and finally taking over 
disbursement of all city funds she said in a letter to the council 
by tuesdays meeting the aggregate fines will total 25500 
she said

common cause asked a federal court thursday to 
close what it says is a loophole that allows presidential campaigns 
to benefit from millions of dollars in indirect contributions from 
fat cats 
however fred wertheimer president of the group which lobbies 
for strict government ethics acknowledged that little more than 
moral force could be exerted this year to keep the presidential 
campaigns from using socalled soft money 
republicans and democrats have said they plan to raise about 67 
million in soft money for the 1988 presidential campaigns 
which are limited to receiving equal funding from the federal 
treasury 
the soft money is donated to state parties which can use it 
to pay for voter registration and getoutthevote drives as well 
as other activities that could have an effect on the presidential 
election 
soft money allows a presidential campaign to raise campaign 
contributions that the presidential campaign finance law was 
enacted to ban wertheimer said at a news conference it opens 
the door for fat cats and special interest givers to provide 
large sums of money to help a presidential candidate and thereby 
creates the opportunity for these givers to buy influence with the 
president of the united states 
robert farmer the dukakis campaigns fundraiser who plans to 
raise 42 million in soft money said he supported closing the 
loophole in the law and blamed the republicans for causing the 
circumstances by traditionally outspending the democrats in this 
area 
i refuse to apologize for trying to create a level playing 
field with the republicans farmer said in a telephone interview 
from miami until they close the loopholes i want to compete 
with the republicans dollar for dollar 
albert maruggi a spokesman for the republican national 
committee said there was no immediate reaction to the common cause 
action 
a year ago us district judge thomas flannery in a lawsuit 
brought by common cause ordered the federal election commission to 
draw up rules governing the use of soft money 
those rules have not been written and common cause filed a 
request with the us district court on thursday for an order 
giving the fec a month to produce a draft of the proposed 
regulations 
even if a hearing were granted immediately and common cause won 
it is unlikely that the rules could have more than marginal legal 
impact before this novembers presidential election according to 
roger witten an attorney for common cause 
fec spokesman fred eiland said the commissions general counsel 
has been working on the rules and is sifting through public 
comments received last march 
you have a small staff of two people who are doing our rule 
making eiland said 
he did not know when a draft of the proposed rules would be 
ready 
wertheimer said common cause believes the use of soft money 
for presidential campaigns is illegal and if the fec had drafted 
rules to that effect it could discourage the practice 
this is illegal money wertheimer said this is money that 
was outlawed in response to watergate 
under questioning however wertheimer acknowledged that while 
common cause raised the issue of illegality in its arguments before 
the court last year the court did not endorse that position

lawyers for oliver l north accused the judge 
in the irancontra case thursday of abandoning fairness in order to 
put the former white house aide on trial before the fall 
presidential election 
the attorneys asked us district judge gerhard a gesell to 
postpone until january a hearing scheduled for next monday on the 
use of classified information at the trial 
the defense said a delay is needed because lawyers havent had 
time to even review in any detail the hundreds of thousands of 
pages of classified and sensitive documents turned over by 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh 
norths lawyers said gesell had imposed impossible deadlines on 
the defense for preparing for mondays hearing and the trial set 
to begin sept 20 
in its frantic rush to trial before the election the court 
seems to have abandoned all sense of what is possible and what is 
fair attorneys brendan v sullivan jr and barry simon said in a 
brief pleading filed in us district court 
the hearing if it is held on aug 8 will be a complete sham 
and the court knows it the defense lawyers said in their 
harshest attack on gesell 
not only is the courts current schedule totally unreasonable 
it is directly contrary to the courts claim that it is simply 
trying to be fair to both sides the defense said quoting 
gesells remarks at a hearing last week 
in a reply brief filed later in the day walsh said norths 
request for a delay reveals the artificiality of the stream of 
demands and complaints to which the government and the court have 
been subjected since arraignment 
in no way should the defendants failure to cooperate with the 
court be rewarded with the interminable delays he seeks walsh 
said 
north is accused of conspiring with former national security 
adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and 
richard v secord to illegally divert the profits of usiran arms 
sales to the nicaraguan contra rebels separate trials have been 
ordered for the other three men 
gesell has ruled that north is entitled to inspect a large 
volume of classified documents in order to try to show that he 
acted with the permission of higher officials in the reagan 
administration 
the hearing monday is scheduled to consider norths proposals to 
use classified information at the trial the classified information 
procedures act sets up a mechanism under which a defendant must 
notify the court and the government of his plan to disclose 
classified information 
if government agencies refuse to declassify documents the court 
deems relevant to the case charges could be dropped 
walsh trying to buy more time to deal with the problems of 
declassifying the documents has suggested that gesell put aside 
the major conspiracy counts against north and proced to trial on 13 
other charges 
these counts which the prosecution contends dont involve 
nearly as many classified documents include allegations that north 
lied to congress obstructed a presidential investigation of the 
irancontra affair and illegally enriched himself 
he is also charged with illegally using a taxexempt foundation 
to raise money for the contras 
the defense also responded to walshs charge that it had flouted 
the law and gesells order by failing to specify which government 
secrets it wants to disclose in court gesell had ordered north to 
file that notice by aug 1 
the defense said it filed its 265page list of documents because 
it was faced with the possibility that documents not listed in 
the notice could be precluded from use at trial

a stream of justice department officials 
lauded attorney general edwin meese iii and showered him with 
plaques and gifts thursday in a farewell ceremony that for two 
hours ignored the investigation that had plagued the nations chief 
legal officer 
none of the 21 speakers commented directly on independent 
counsel james c mckays investigation of meeses personal 
financial dealings or on claims by two former justice department 
officials that a deep malaise had overcome the agency as a result 
of meeses legal troubles 
the farewell ceremonies open to department employees ran on so 
long that meese said he was keeping his remarks short because the 
activities were intruding on lunch hour 
besides a variety of plaques and other souvenirs meese received 
a tomahawk with a peace pipe an inoperative hand grenade and a 
cap supposedly designed for a czar 
some of the hundreds of workers who packed the auditorium and 
stood on the balcony left before meese spoke meeses wife ursula 
and his daughter dana sat in the front row 
later in the day meese invited several hundred justice 
department officials and others to a dropin party where he stood 
in a receiving line as people sipped white wine and punch and ate 
hors doeuvres 
meese who is resigning this month after 3 years in which he 
has faced a barrage of criticism for his conduct said he was 
really overwhelmed by the outpouring of praise which came from 
men who are political appointees though a few had risen through 
the career ranks 
last month mckay issued a report concluding criminal 
prosecution of meese was unwarranted though he said meese probably 
violated tax laws 
meese has attacked mckays report as well as testimony by arnold 
i burns the former deputy attorney general and william weld 
former head of the criminal division both men criticized meese on 
capitol hill last week 
william bradford reynolds meeses counselor and one of his 
closest working confidants said meese has been fully engaged and 
fully involved in leading the department there is no rancor or 
vindictiveness in the attorney general he said 
speakers at the farewell included fbi director william sessions 
solicitor general charles fried j michael quinlan director of 
the bureau of prisons alan nelson head of the immigration and 
naturalization service and several assistant attorneys general 
some of the speakers talked about meeses professional 
accomplishments and many recounted personal and sometimes 
emotional stories about the outgoing attorney general 
meese has promoted civil rights assisted indians worked with 
europeans helped spur the economy and cracked down on crime 
various speakers said 
patrick korten meeses spokesman described the attorney 
general as a friendly and affable man who has a genial 
nature and never loses his temper one of the best things 
about the job korten said was its never been boring 
in his remarks meese thanked the justice departments 72000 
employees for their selfless devotion and cited the agencys 
handling of prison riots in atlanta and louisiana last november as 
one of its finest moments prison workers who had been taken 
hostage by cuban inmates were released unharmed after more than a 
week of negotiations

republican george bush said 
thursday that michael dukakis views on foreign policy would amount 
to unilateral disarmament and called the democratic platform 
the black hole of american politics 
speaking to the gi forum a hispanic veterans group the 
republican nomineetobe said dukakis had veered far outside the 
mainstream bipartisan consensus formed after world war ii a 
consensus that believed it was america and only america that 
could lead the world to freedom and peace 
his positions amount to a rejection of americas role as a 
world leader and a repudiation of the truman doctrine and the 
vision of john kennedy bush said 
his speech came in the wake of the vice presidents repeated 
attempts this week to portray dukakis as soft on foreign policy 
an area seen by republican strategists as one in which the 
massachusetts governor is vulnerable 
bush cited dukakis support for a nuclear freeze and opposition 
to a new mx missile the midgetman missile and the reagan 
administrations proposed star wars nuclear defense system 
dukakis campaigning in mississippi was asked by reporters if 
he still supports a nuclear weapons freeze sure and a 
comprehensive test ban treaty he said 
later aboard his campaign plane dukakis said he originally 
supported a nuclear freeze because we wanted to stop the 
administration from expanding the arsenal 
now its turned around and were talking about reduction im 
for reductions now he said there are certain weapons systems 
whose development i favor but there are also serious 
negotiations under way im for developing certain weapons systems 
and for substantially reducing others 
asked again if he was for a freeze dukakis said no i favor 
the development of certain arms systems i favor deep cuts in 
strategic weapons systems 
bush said dukakis views add up to no modernization of us 
forces and no modernization amounts to unilateral disarmament 
dukakis called bushs disarmament charge nonsense and 
added we have a massive survivable nuclear deterrent right now 
12000 strategic nuclear warheads what we dont have is the kind 
of strong conventional defense capability we must have and that is 
going to be my top priority as president 
bush said the democratic platform is no help in trying to 
determine where the democratic presidential nominee stood on 
foreign policy issues 
the democratic platform is the black hole of american 
politics he said issues get sucked into it and lost never to 
reappear again 
at an airport news conference bush was asked whether members of 
his campaign staff had been advancing rumors concerning dukakis 
mental health 
i assume no one in my campaign is doing anything of that 
kind he said i would thoroughly disapprove of it 
he also said president reagan was broadminded in retracting 
his comment on wednesday in which he referred to dukakis as an 
invalid and said the massachusetts governors response was 
fine 
meanwhile bush campaign staffers have been told to do nothing 
to keep alive the rumors about dukakis mental health after bush 
himself wondered whether some of the information was coming from 
his campaign according to his chief of staff craig fuller 
he asked me the question fuller said i have no reason to 
believe we have any of our people behind it 
fuller said campaign manager lee atwater gathered the bush staff 
together wednesday and admonished everybody to stay out of this 
story stay out of the rumor business 
george bush doesnt want us involved in that kind of a 
story fuller said one of the troublesome aspects of a 
presidential campaign is that a rumor takes off and has a life of 
its own i dont know what the reality is but i figure its up to 
somebody else besides us to find out 
on another subject fuller confirmed that treasury secretary 
james a baker iii would resign his post to become chairman of the 
bush campaign before the start of the gop convention on august 15 
bakers plans to join the campaign have been widely reported 
and previously confirmed by sources in both the bush campaign and 
the reagan administration 
sources have said that reagan would nominate new york investment 
banker nicholas brady to serve out the remainder of bakers term 
and that the announcement could come as early as friday 
however fuller said there still is no lock on the exact day 
for bakers job switch 
at the news conference bush predicted that he would win texas 
his adopted state despite the presence on the democratic ticket 
of vice presidential candidate sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
the race is between george bush and michael dukakis in 
texas he said i am going to spend what it takes and be here 
as long as it takes to win texas 
he said he hopes to win the hispanic vote even though he 
doesnt speak spanish as dukakis and bentsen do 
it isnt whether you can speak spanish its what is in your 
heart bush said he dukakis can speak spanish but i have 
the heartbeat bush then repeated his oftenused reference to his 
three grandchildren who are part mexicanamerican 
bush later traveled to chicago to attend the wake of the late 
aloysius majewski president of the national polish alliance 
before returning to washington 
he was an outstanding example for all of us bush told 
reporters outside the funeral home in northwest chicago the vice 
president refused to answer political questions saying i am 
here to pay my respects to a great polishamerican thats all i 
want to say

st basils cathedral the 400yearold patchwork 
of color anchoring one end of red square has serious structural 
defects but is kept open because of the money it earns from 
tourism a newspaper said thursday 
sovietskaya kultura said st basils built in 15541560 by 
order of ivan the terrible has cracked walls a leaky basement and 
problems caused by temperature variations and moisture 
its onion domes of red green gold and blue sit atop a central 
chapel and nine small ones connected by narrow passageways 
more than 300000 tourists a year visit the cathedral one of 
the most famous attractions in the soviet union the paper said 
the structure is an adjunct of the state historical museum 
tourists let in heat cold or moisture depending on the season 
and officials discovered five years ago the basement was absorbing 
underground water a terrible loss that has victimized many of 
moscows monuments of architecture the paper said 
instead of closing the church for repairs or on days when it is 
too hot too cold or too humid officials keep it open for the 
tourists sovietskaya kultura reported 
the main thing is that the cathedral brings without 
interruption about 300000 rubles roughly 480 million of clear 
income every year to the state historical museum it said 
the museum itself on the opposite side red square has been 
closed for the two years for repairs and probably will stay closed 
for two more the newspaper said that leaves st basils and a 
small museum at moscows novodevichy cemetery as the state 
historicals only moneymakers 
to close the cathedral in this situation means leaving workers 
of the state historical museum without an income it said 
sovietskaya kultura paper said it did not want to sensationalize 
the cathdrals problems but warned that many architectural 
landmarks have been damaged because cursory inspections did not 
reveal their true structural problems 
it said there is no tragedy so far whether one will happen 
no one knows but we have to know if some misfortune befalls 
the cathedral our entire generation will never be cleansed of the 
shame 
ivan the terrible ordered the cathedral built to celebrate the 
russian defeat of tatar invaders at kazan 
legend says he had the architects blinded after st basils was 
built so they could not design anything to rival it

the worlds anglican bishops adopted 
a resolution thursday that states they understand people who choose 
armed struggle as the only way to justice but condemns war as 
unchristian 
the bishops also decided thursday to allow polygamists into 
their church provided they marry no more wives after baptism the 
bishops all men did not address the issue of polyandry where a 
woman takes several husbands 
archbishop robert eames of all ireland who represents anglicans 
in both the irish republic and northern ireland harshly criticized 
the violence clause he said the statement could be used by the 
irish republican army to justify its violent campaign to drive the 
british out of the province of northern ireland 
archbishop desmond tutu of south africa supported the clause 
pointing to people without parliamentary means of seeking justice 
the 525 bishops from 164 countries were assembled in canterbury 
for the lambeth conference held every 10 years they represent 70 
million anglicans worldwide their threeweek conference ends 
sunday 
after 10 minutes of debate the bishops accepted by a show of 
hands the resolution titled war violence and justice which 
condemns war as incompatible with the teaching and example of our 
lord jesus christ 
the disputed clause says the conference understands those who 
after exhausting all other ways choose the way of armed struggle 
as the only way to justice whilst drawing attention to the dangers 
and injustices possible in such action 
bishop brian hannon of northern ireland told the bishops that 
armed struggle in his province is simply leading us farther 
farther and farther into depravity immorality and further 
violence 
attempts by irish bishops to have the words in selfdefense 
inserted into the clause were defeated 226 to 168 with 29 bishops 
abstaining 
archbishop eames in an interview with the british broadcasting 
corp after the vote spoke strongly against the wording 
we are losing members of our church anglicans who are serving 
in the security forces of northern ireland we are losing 
civilians two of them are being buried today and tomorrow in my 
diocese and in belfast eames said 
the ira this week killed three members of britains security 
forces in the predominantly protestant northern ireland which it 
seeks to unite with the roman catholic irish republic 
tutu said the resolution referred to people who did not have 
parliamentary means to effect political change south africas 
apartheid system of institutionalized racial segregation denies the 
vote to the countrys 26 million black majority the 5 million 
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts schools 
and health services 
our people have used conventional means and each time the 
response has been a violent response said tutu the black church 
leader who won the 1984 nobel peace prize 
we are not asking you to condone or condemn but we are asking 
you to say to those of our people who have tried everything we 
understand the church is not pacifist tutu said 
bishop david young of ripon northern england said after the 
vote that the resolution was drawn up by a large group of bishops 
meeting privately during the conference with especially strong 
support from bishops in south africa and latin america 
we felt we had to take a wide view for the whole of the 
anglican communion said young who proposed the resolution 
archbishop john habgood of york england spoke in favor of the 
clause after the vote 
the irish sensitivity was very much borne in mind as was the 
feeling that the ira will pick up and twist to their own use 
anything which seemed to offer them a handle of support he said 
but he said the key word was understand and that while both 
sides of the irish conflict had perfectly good parliamentary 
methods other christians around the world might not 
the vote on polygamy was also taken by a show of hands with 
only about 12 of the 525 participating bishops opposed 
under the policy the anglican church will recognize both 
husbands and their multiple wives as christians if the men take no 
new brides after they are baptized 
after the vote bishop ralph hatendi of harare in the church of 
the province of central africa said polygamy was not a major issue 
anymore in africa 
the culture is potentially polygamous but it does usually 
depend on the area and also the wealth of the bridegroom he said 
there are no women bishops in the anglican communion but 
several of the autonomous churches in the communion including the 
25 millionmember episcopal church of the united states have 
ordained women priests 
on monday the bishops approved a compromise resolution on the 
issue 
in effect it recognized that nothing can be done to prevent 
anglican churches in the united states canada and new zealand from 
consecrating a woman bishop after ordaining hundreds of women 
priests 
the resolution said the 27 selfgoverning anglican churches 
should respect such a move and that a commission headed by runcie 
be set up to prepare guidelines for it

former presidential hopeful jesse jackson 
testified thursday that his livelihood is being hurt by a company 
selling videotapes of his speech at the democratic national 
convention 
jackson has sued mpi home video of suburban oak forest to try to 
halt sales and distribution of the tape and he testified in 
support of a request that the company be permanently barred from 
distributing it 
it has hurt the ability of my family to negotiate with a 
distributor to sell my own words and image and likeness jackson 
told us district judge james b zagel and about 100 spectators 
it has reduced our ability to make a living off my work he 
said 
the lawsuit charges mpi is exploiting jacksons name stature 
and literary oratorical and creative skills and it seeks to have 
copies of the videotape destroyed 
as the hearing closed zagel renewed a temporary order 
prohibiting mpi from selling and distributing more of the tapes 
until aug 12 and scheduled another hearing for aug 11 
jackson testified that he reaped 100000 four years ago from 
marketing a videotape of his speech to the 1984 democratic national 
convention and that mpis distribution of this years speech has 
cut into its market potential 
lawyers for mpi contend that the convention speech was a news 
event unprotected by copyright law and that mpi legitimately 
purchased abctvs coverage of the speech from the network for 
6500 
they are not pirates attorney robert breisblatt said of mpi 
after the hearing they have a right to that tape 
the 60minute tape titled jesse jackson we can dream 
again is uncut abc coverage complete with commercials he said 
jaffer ali vice president of marketing for mpi a familyowned 
business has said previously that his company received 25000 
orders for the 1495 videotape within 24 hours after it went on 
the market 
ali has said the july 19 speech was a very special moment in 
history and that he and his family decided to market it while 
jackson was delivering it 
jackson said he learned about the mpi venture four days later by 
reading about it in a newspaper and he called his lawyer to take 
legal action 
when breisblatt asked jackson if he had tried to contact ali 
before instituting legal action jackson replied i felt too 
insulted by the commercial exploitation of me 
during almost an hour on the witness stand jackson limited most 
of his responses to brief answers in contrast to his usually 
expansive style but his sense of humor edged in when breisblatt 
tried to place the address in the context of primetime television 
you understand what i mean by prime time breisblatt asked 
when i speak jackson replied prompting the courtroom to 
erupt in laughter and even bringing a smile to zagels face

the senate began again thursday efforts to 
come up with a pentagon budget bill that president reagan will 
accept a day after reagan vetoed a military spending bill which he 
charged would weaken us defenses 
the senate started consideration of a bill appropriating 282 
billion for the pentagon although no votes or major debate were 
expected before friday 
reagan had vetoed a bill authorizing 2995 billion in pentagon 
spending for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 but indicated he 
might sign the companion appropriation measure 
in the complicated congressional budget process one set of 
legislation is passed to authorize spending and then separate 
measures are enacted to actually appropriate the money to pay for 
those authorized projects 
although the bill considered thursday appropriates 16 billion 
less than the measure rejected by reagan the appropriation measure 
essentially covers the same projects however the dollar totals 
are not as large because authorizing bills generally permit 
spending for more longrange projects amounts which are contained 
in the authorization measures 
two of reagans main objections to the authorization bill were 
its reductions in his request for star wars antimissile spending 
and arms control policy restrictions added by the democraticbacked 
congress 
the appropriations bill considered thursday contains the same 
cuts in star wars funds but none of the arms control restrictions 
however those restrictions could be added later 
when the senate passes its appropriation bill the measure will 
go to a housesenate conference committee to be reconciled with the 
similar bill enacted by the house six weeks ago 
earlier thursday leading conservatives said reagans veto of 
the defense bill had bolstered conservative support for the 
presidential candidacy of vice president george bush 
we told the president there was nothing he could have done 
that would have given our troops more of a shot in the arm than 
this veto edwin j fuelner jr president of the heritage 
foundation told reporters 
fuelner and other supporters of reagans military policies were 
interviewed outside the white house after meeting with the 
president in the cabinet room 
he will go out in our opinion the way president eisenhower 
did with a strong principled fight on an issue that will bring 
our people together fuelner said 
weve had trouble this summer getting people interested he 
said whatever the intention this piece of work the veto was a 
brilliant stroke because i havent seen people so excited in 
months 
reagan disavowed any partisan intent in vetoing the bill on 
wednesday 
also applauding the veto was retired lt gen daniel graham 
president of high frontier a principal supporter of the 
presidents star wars spacebased missile defense system 
graham said high frontier members are not only delighted that 
the president vetoed it they are delighted that george bush urged 
the veto and theyre delighted that george bush is taking a 
stronger stand on sdi 
the formal name of the star wars program is strategic defense 
initiative 
john tower of texas former republican chairman of the senate 
armed services committee said i think the president having 
vetoed the bill and having drawn the issue clearly is going to make 
it more politically perilous for the democratic majority in 
congress to repeat the bad legislation that appeared in this bill 
richard perle former assistant secretary of defense and now a 
fellow at the american enterprise institute said the key issue 
was the future of sdi this is not a dispute over details or 
precise funding levels the action taken by congress was 
intended to kill the program without taking political 
responsibility 
although the bill provided approximately the funds that reagan 
had requested administration officials say it would have crippled 
star wars by shifting funds away from the most promising areas of 
research 
kenneth adelman former director of the arms control and 
disarmament agency said the big message here is that bad 
national security is bad politics this was a bad national security 
bill and to veto it is good politics 
adelman saw the veto as the start of the issuefocused bush 
campaign and the staving off of creeping lame duckism for the 
reagan administration 
others attending the meeting included earl stock commander in 
chief of the veterans of foreign wars edwin rowny arms control 
adviser to the president dr edward teller the nuclear physicist 
and anna chennault president of tac international

the senate inched toward bipartisan agreement 
late thursday on a proposed aid package for nicaraguas contra 
rebels after democrats promised to ensure a chance for a separate 
vote on military aid before congress adjourns for the year 
were getting very very close said sen david boren of 
oklahoma a procontra democrat after a day of proposals and 
counterproposals between the two parties 
a key to reaching agreement appeared to be a new letter from 
house speaker jim wright dtexas promising to bring any request 
from president reagan for weapons aid for the rebels to a quick 
vote the letter boren said would include a guarantee that 
congress would not adjourn without acting on such a request first 
wright made a similar promise as part of an agreement on 
humanitarian aid for the contras last march but several republican 
senators said they needed stronger assurances 
theres a great deal of suspicion of jim wright said sen 
john mccain rariz 
the negotiations which included reagans national security 
adviser colin powell began shortly after the white house rejected 
a democratic aid proposal that had been worked out a day earlier 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas drew up a list of 
objections to the democratic aid proposal and democrats said later 
they were willing to make some minor changes in an effort to win 
broader support for the measure 
wed love to see bob dole and the republicans join us on 
this said sen christopher dodd dconn but dodd added that 
democrats would not budge on major aspects of the package because 
to do so would destroy the fragile agreement among democrats that 
led to the proposal on wednesday 
the democratic proposal which defers action on lethal aid for 
the rebels until later this year falls far short of getting any 
real hope for freedom and democracy in nicaragua said white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater humanitarian aid is too 
limited too narrowly defined to be of any real help 
but fitzwater noted that existing humanitarian aid doesnt run 
out until sept 30 leaving time to work out a middle ground on the 
issue 
theres a good chance for contra aid legislation to pass he 
told reporters legislators on both sides of aisle and the white 
house seem to share the feeling of outrage about the sandinistas 
and support for the contras so i think theres a very good chance 
of passage of some kind of legislation 
fitzwater referred to recent actions by the leftist government 
in managua to crack down on opponents shut down opposition media 
outlets and expel us diplomats 
the most vigorous objection from republican senators to the 
democratic proposal was to its provisions setting up a later 
congressional vote on whether to resume the flow of weapons aid to 
the rebels 
the package worked out by senate majority leader robert byrd 
dwva would require any presidential request for lethal aid to 
go for consideration first by the house which has traditionally 
been more resistant to such aid 
republicans also argued that it would give undue influence to 
house speaker wright an aid opponent nobody trusts the 
speaker said sen malcolm wallop rwyo emerging from a 
meeting of contra supporters he said wright has reneged on past 
promises as to when and how he would bring contra aid to the house 
floor for a vote 
byrd characterized his aid package worked out over two weeks of 
discussions with more than a dozen senate democrats as one that 
would give incentives to both the sandinistas and the rebels to 
revive and conclude their faltering peace talks 
the proposal would provide an additional 27 million in food 
clothing shelter and medical supplies to continue current rates of 
such aid through next march it also promises economic and trade 
assistance for nicaragua if managua goes along with a 
comprehensive final agreement to provide for peace and democracy in 
nicaragua 
conversely some 163 million worth of stockpiled weaponry 
could be released to the contras if president reagan certifies 
before congress adjourns for the year that two of three conditions 
are met the sandinistas continue to violate terms of a regional 
peace accord nicaragua receives unacceptable levels of 
sovietbloc weaponry and the sandinistas launch an unprovoked 
military attack on the contras 
but the weapons withheld from delivery to rebel forces since 
the two sides entered a ceasefire earlier this year would not be 
released unless both houses of congress voted to accept reagans 
certification with the house going first

soviet defense minister dmitri t 
yazov said thursday he and defense secretary frank carlucci became 
good friends during four days of talks and unprecedented tours of 
secret soviet military bases 
the rotund redcheeked 64yearold soviet general was the 
constant companion of carlucci 57 a career foreign service 
officer 
we parted not only as colleagues but as good friends yazov 
told reporters after a 46mile drive with carlucci over mountain 
roads on the crimean peninsula from the navys black sea port in 
sevastopol to an airport in the city of simferopol 
yazov saw carlucci and his advisers off on a flight over the 
black sea to turkey for talks with turkish leaders and a visit to a 
nato base 
yazov who first met carlucci in berne switzerland in march 
and then during the recent superpower summit in moscow said 
increasing ussoviet military contacts contribute to lessening 
tensions and strengthening peace 
the two discussed us and soviet military doctrines imbalances 
in each others forces and regional conflicts in the persian gulf 
afghanistan and southeast asia yazov said he did not elaborate 
carlucci said the two sides refined procedures for preventing 
dangerous military incidents 
the soviets continued thursday to provide the visiting americans 
access to their latest military hardware 
carlucci and accompanying us navy officers were allowed aboard 
a missile cruiser replete with sophisticated electronic 
communications and navigational equipment and capable of carrying 
nuclear weapons 
the american defense chief spent 45 minutes inspecting 
antisubmarine navigational and missilelaunching systems aboard 
the cruiser slava glory docked at a civilian sea terminal on the 
bay of sevastopol the headquarters of the soviet black sea fleet 
it was the first time the soviets have allowed americans to 
board the slava which is the prototype for a class of modern 
soviet missile cruisers the slava is the pride of the black sea 
fleet as its most advanced warship 
the soviet chief of staff marshal sergei f akhromeyev toured 
the aircraft carrier uss theodore roosevelt during a visit to the 
united states last month 
carlucci yazov and the black sea fleet commander admiral 
mikhail n khronopulo emerged from limousines and walked across a 
gangway as a 20member navy band played and 30 honor guards 
carrying kalashnikov submachine guns stood at attention on the 
freshly painted deck 
american and soviet flags flying on the ship were dwarfed by a 
crowded crop of antennas 
reporters and photographers were not allowed on the tour but 
watched from the dock as radar antennas twirled around and a 130mm 
gun pivoted on its turret before carlucci 
its obviously a very capable ship carlucci a former 
deputy chief of the cia and exwhite house national security 
adviser told reporters at the simferopol airport 
the ship weighs 12500 tons is 613 feet long and can cruise at 
up to 34 knots according to janes fighting ships it can fire 16 
surfacetosurface cruise missiles with nuclear warheads and eight 
surfacetoair missiles 
carlucci also turned his attention to the bloody military past 
of the crimea occupied at various periods by the turks the 
russians and nazi germany on thursday he stopped by a colorful 
twostory indoor mural showing a june 6 1855 battle during the 
crimean war between the russians on one side and british french 
and turkish forces on the other 
he wound up his visit to the seaside city with a ceremony on a 
downtown square dozens of sailors lined the square in 88degree 
heat as a navy band played the starspangled banner and the 
soviet national anthem 
a few dozen of the towns 230000 residents waved to carlucci 
and yazov as their motorcade sped by 
carlucci was the first american official to visit sevastopol 
since president franklin d roosevelt and a military delegation 
stopped by in 1945 to view the city which was heavily damaged 
during the war roosevelt was in the area to attend a summit at the 
crimean city of yalta with josef stalin and british prime minister 
winston churchill 
because of the naval base sevastopol is offlimits to 
foreigners and most soviets 
carlucci told reporters he came away from his visit with new 
respect for the professionalism of the soviet military and a 
better understanding of the soviet armed forces 
on monday he visited the kubinka air force base for the first 
look at the topsecret blackjack bomber ever allowed a western 
official then watched over soviet war games at the taman motorized 
rifle division base southwest of the capital

former army man and diplomat became thailands first elected prime 
minister in 12 years on thursday and vowed to seek better relations 
with communist indochina next door 
the 66yearold businessman also told reporters he would 
generally continue the economically oriented prowestern policies 
of his predecessor prem tinsulanonda chatichai was a deputy prime 
minister under prem 
prem a former army commander in chief held the prime 
ministers post for eight years but belonged to no political party 
the 67yearold prem chose not to stay in office 
chatichai was nominated for the top government post by five 
political parties who won a majority of seats in july 24 
parliamentary elections and agreed to form a coalition government 
the new prime minister said thursday that a sixth party has been 
added to the coalition giving it 220 of the 357 seats in 
parliament 
king bhumibol adulyadej thailands constitutional monarch 
formally approved the nomination thursday in a fiveparagraph royal 
decree which a parliamentary official delivered to chatichai on a 
golden tray at his home 
chatichai said his cabinet has been completed and will be 
announced after prime minister margaret thatcher of britain ends a 
visit here next tuesday 
chatichai leads the chart thai thai nation party which won 
the most seats the other coalition partners are the social action 
party democratic party rassadorn citizens party the united 
democracy party and the muan chon mass party 
asked by reporters about his foreign policy chatichai said 
there will be changes where our neighbors are concerned we want 
vietnam laos and cambodia to be our markets not our battlefield 
thailands relations with the three nations known collectively 
as indochina and once a french colony have been strained since 
communist forces seized power there in 1975 
thailand has been in frequent border clashes with laos and 
cambodia and has backed guerrillas fighting vietnamese occupation

military traditionally a key player in the rise and fall of 
governments here 
chatichai also may face the same internal bickering and attacks 
from increasingly vocal opposition parties that plagued prem

four attackers fired more than 
100 bullets at pointblank range and killed two men who worked at a 
nearby police station authorities said the outlawed irish 
republican army claimed responsibility 
the ira said the men ignored ira warnings against performing 
maintenance or construction for police or the british army in 
northern ireland 
its statement sent to news organizations in belfast threatened 
other civilians who do such work 
the ira which is fighting to expel the british from the 
province of northern ireland earlier this week killed four members 
of britains security forces three in attacks in northern ireland 
and one in the bombing of an army barracks in north london the 
attacks injured 42 people 
thursdays victims aged 60 and 64 had been doing maintenance 
work at the royal ulster constabulary station in belleek county 
fermanagh near the border with the irish republic police said 
the victims names were not immediately released 
the workers were driving in a van to their homes in county 
fermanagh they had reached a crossroads about 30 yards from the 
border when four men dressed in combat gear and carrying rifles 
and handguns fired from a stolen car police said 
police said up to 150 rounds were fired 
the iras campaign to stop construction work for british 
security forces began in august 1985 when a supplier of portable 
structures to replace bombed buildings was shot and killed at his 
home in dublin the irish capital 
since then several contractors have been killed 
a belfast newspaper said earlier thursday that the upsurge in 
ira violence could signal the start of a yearlong campaign to mark 
the 20th anniversary of the outbreak of sectarian and political 
strife in northern ireland 
the irish news read mainly by roman catholics and considered 
authoritative on matters concerning the ira said the ira hopes to 
sway public opinion on the british mainland behind demands for 
pulling british troops out of northern ireland 
it said that as the 20th anniversary of the socalled 
troubles approaches the ira is determined to prove that 
britain has not succeeded in bringing peace to the province 
the critical thing as far as the ira is concerned is getting 
the debate going the debate that will show the british presence 
has failed the paper quoted an unidentified nationalist source 
as saying 
the irish news also said the campaign may be an ira attempt to 
reestablish its standing in staunchly catholic areas after botched 
attacks left 17 civilians dead since november 
edward mcgrady a lawmaker from the moderate catholic social 
democratic and labor party suggested that the violence may stem 
from an internal split on tactics between militants and more 
politically minded members of the ira 
that may be one of the reasons for the increased violent 
activity the increased killings in england and in ireland there 
could indeed be a division an increasing division the military 
the hawks in the group are trying to sabotage any movement toward 
political reconciliation taking place he said in a british 
broadcasting corp radio interview 
britain ordered troops into the province aug 14 1969 after 
violence flared in londonderry during a civil rights march by 
catholics since then at least 2665 people have died as a result 
of sectarian and political fighting 
the ira wants to drive the british from northern ireland and 
unite the predominantly protestant province with the overwhelmingly 
catholic republic of ireland 
northern ireland secretary tom king the british cabinet member 
responsible for the province has ordered a review of safety 
measures for 17000 police and parttime soldiers based there

george bush and his gop allies painted democrat michael dukakis 
as weak on military and foreign policy thursday while dukakis 
campaigned in the south seeking votes where ronald reagan won in 
1980 and 1984 and where jesse jackson did well in this years 
democratic primaries 
prominent democrats and dukakis doctor meantime suggested 
that political motivations were behind a rumor that dukakis had 
been treated for mental problems a rumor both dukakis and the 
doctor denied 
and the bush campaign received its strongest no thank you 
yet from a man frequently mentioned as a prospective running mate 
california gov george deukmejian 
bush in corpus christi texas told a group of hispanic 
veterans that dukakis positions were a rejection of americas 
role as a world leader and a repudiation of the truman doctrine and 
the vision of john kennedy 
dukakis opposition to new nuclear weapons such as the mx 
missile were part of a policy for unilateral disarmament bush 
told the gi forum 
president reagan lent bush a helping hand earlier this week by 
vetoing a defense bill passed by the democraticcontrolled 
congress although the bill provided an agreedupon 2995 billion 
for the pentagon reagan said it was too restrictive especially on 
his star wars missile defense program 
the only reason anyone can possbily give for it is that it 
might help the vice president dukakis said thursday evening in 
los angeles i dont think it helps the vice president it 
certainly doesnt help the nation it doesnt help our national 
security 
republicans in the senate on thursday were pushing for more 
money for arms to the contras at least in part to embarrass 
dukakis the massachusetts governors running mate sen lloyd 
bentsen dtexas disagrees with dukakis on that issue and usually 
supports contra aid 
dukakis in philadelphia miss repeated his theme of making 
the military spend its money more wisely and he told reporters it 
was nonsense for bush to suggest he favored disarmament 
the fact of the matter is we have a massive survivable nuclear 
deterrent right now 12000 strategic nuclear warheads he said 
what we dont have is the kind of strong conventional defense 
capability we must have and that is going to be my top priority as 
president 
asked whether he still supports a nuclear freeze dukakis said 
sure and a comprehensive test ban treaty 
later aboard his plane dukakis said he originally supported a 
freeze because we wanted to stop the administration from 
expanding the arsenal 
now its turned around and were talking about reduction im 
for reductions now he said i favor the development of certain 
arms systems i favor deep cuts in strategic weapons systems 
dukakis spoke to a mostly white audience estimated at more than 
6000 at the neshoba county fair where eight years ago reagan 
launched his campaign as the new republican presidential nominee 
at the same time he was campaigning in a state where he lost 
this years democratic primary to jackson 
he talked of civil rights in addition to his usual calls for 
industrial revitalization and investment in schools 
let us work together to see that every citizen and every child 
born in this country is an equal shareholder in the american 
dream he said 
elsewhere democrats expressed anger about a rumor that dukakis 
had problems with mental depression in the 1970s first following 
the death of his brother and then with his 1978 primary defeat for 
reelection as governor 
i think theres something significant about what the 
republicans have done here the fact that they would use lyndon 
larouche to get this thing started the fact that they would get 
negative that they would get to irrelevant so early said new 
york gov mario cuomo 
at the democratic national convention in atlanta two weeks ago 
supporters of larouche a political extremist and fringe 
presidential candidate distributed fliers suggesting dukakis was 
unstable 
dukakis doctor for the past 17 years gerald r plotkin said 
i would have to assume that the rumors are political i dont 
know whether the term is dirty tricks but i think certainly the 
allegations have no basis in fact 
the issue became widely publicized wednesday after reagan called 
dukakis an invalid during a news briefing reagan later said he 
was trying to make a joke but it didnt work 
bush told reporters thursday that he would thoroughly 
disapprove of it if anyone from his campaign was involved in the 
rumormaking 
his chief of staff craig fuller said that on wednesday 
campaign manager lee atwater admonished everybody to stay out of 
this story stay out of the rumor business 
fuller also confirmed that treasury secretary james a baker iii 
would leave his post and become campaign chief before the aug 15 
start of the republican convention in new orleans 
between swipes at dukakis bush is looking for a running mate 
but it looked as if it wont be deukmejian who as governor of 
california might help bush in the state with the most electoral

california gov george deukmejian said 
thursday in a letter to republican george bush that he cannot be 
considered for the vice presidency because winning that election 
would mean handing over the states governorship to a democrat 
bush chief of staff craig fuller said late thursday that bush 
would respect deukmejians wishes adding he is going to be very 
important to us in winning california 
kevin brett deukmejians press secretary said the governor 
sent the letter to bush from seoul korea the final stop in 
deukmejians twoweek trade mission to the far east 
brett said the letter to the certain gop presidential nominee 
was prompted by a request from the bush campaign for deukmejian to 
fill out financial disclosure forms that the campaign is seeking 
from prospective running mates 
brett said deukmejian also received telephone calls in the far 
east from treasurer secretary jim baker who is soon to become 
bushs campaign chairman and bob kimmitt who is heading the 
effort to screen vice presidential prospects 
i am honored and very grateful for your consideration but i 
must tell you that i cannot be considered for the office of vice 
president deukmejian said in his letter to bush 
as you know if i were to assume the vice presidency it would 
mean turning the entire executive branch of the nations most 
populous state over to the democratic party deukmejian said 
noting that was something he could not consider doing 
california lt gov leo mccarthy who is running this year for 
the us senate and the next four elected officials in the line of 
succession for governor should deukmejian give up the office are 
all democrats 
deukmejians term ends in 1990 whoever is governor after that 
will be in charge of the state during the congressional 
reapportionment based on the 1990 census 
reapportionment done every decade after the census divides the 
state into districts that must be equal in population but are 
typically skewed in shape to protect incumbents and members of the 
majority party 
brett released copies of the deukmejian letter in sacramento he 
said in addition to the letter deukmejians chief of staff 
michael frost telephoned bush aides this morning on air force two 
to advise them that deukmejian was taking himself out of 
consideration 
the governor is not going to complete the financial disclosure 
forms brett said the chief of staff advised the bush campaign 
the comments in deukmejians letter are similar to his 
oftenrepeated public statements that even if asked i would have 
to refuse the no 2 spot on the ticket 
despite the denials deukmejians name continues to appear on 
lists of potential running mates he is a republican governor of 
the nations largest state and has dropped hints that he might be 
interested in the vice presidential post 
deukmejian first commented on his interest at a texas gop dinner 
in may saying that he was hoping that somebody might come along 
and figure out a way i could be vice president and at the same time 
let the republicans hold onto control of the statehouse in 
california 
deukmejian fanned further speculation in early june when he 
brushed aside a direct question about the vice presidency by joking 
that his astrologer told him not to answer a few days later he 
responded to the same question by saying you should never say 
never

un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar said thursday that both iran and iraq accept the concept of 
facetoface peace talks and the big question is when will they 
take place 
the issue of direct negotiations before a ceasefire has created 
an impasse in talks aimed at ending the 8yearold persian gulf 
war iraq had demanded facetoface talks before a ceasefire iran 
said they can only take place afterward 
the concept of direct talks is accepted by both sides and the 
matter is when perez de cuellar told reporters thursday as he 
left un headquarters that is something on which i am working 
diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
un chief proposed to both sides that he announce a ceasefire 
date and simultaneously invite both iran and iraq to hold direct 
talks on a comprehensive peace treaty 
perez de cuellar did not spell out his proposals for reporters 
and said he has not yet received a formal response from iraq 
diplomatic sources have said baghad is cool but stopped short of 
outright rejection 
perez de cuellar said irans response although not formal has 
been constructive 
unfortunately from the iraqi side i have not received the 
comments which i have asked for perez de cuellar told reporters 
the secretarygeneral received a report thursday from a un 
military team on arrangements for a unsupervised ceasefire in 
the war the contents were not disclosed but the un chief said 
he would make a report to the security council in informal 
consultations friday 
he said that next week probably on wednesday he will deliver a 
comprehensive report to the council on the entire situation 
relating to declaration of a ceasefire troop withdrawal prisoner 
exchange and other elements of a un peace plan 
it was not clear when he would declare what he calls a dday 
beginning a ceasefire but he indicated he could make the 
announcement next week 
the ceasefire report was delivered by lt gen martin vadset 
the norwegian head of the un truce supervision organization in 
jerusalem he returned from a mission to tehran and baghdad where 
he studied arrangements for a unsupervised truce 
the sources said the secretarygeneral outlined his ideas for 
ending the stalemate over direct talks during in a meeting with the 
nonaligned members of the security council on wednesday 
the plan laid out before argentina algeria nepal zambia 
senegal and yugoslavia the nonaligned council members was 
disclosed as perez de cuellar met for more than an hour with 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati of iran velayati left without 
making a comment 
under the secretarygenerals plan direct talks could start the 
same day a ceasefire was announced perhaps in a week or 10 days 
no dates have been set 
it is one of the compromises perez de cuellar has weighed in 
trying to close the gap between the iranian and iraqi positions 
iraq says it needs the talks as a guarantee of sincerity from iran 
which resisted un peace efforts for a year and then suddenly 
agreed to them last month 
the sources said the secretarygeneral wants to secure the 
commitment of iran and iraq to a comprehensive sequential 
implemention of resolution 598 including a ceasefire troop 
withdrawal and repatriation of prisoners of war 
iraq also has been seeking the assurance of the five permanent 
members of the 15member security council to guarantee a 
ceasefire the five united states soviet union china britain 
and france have been drafting a paper calling for direct talks 
and appealing to both sides to bring a swift end to the conflict 
iraq says it fears iran will seek only a temporary truce to 
regroup forces not a permanent peace and so it wants some kind of 
international underwriting of an agreement 
earlier thursday iran urged the security council to condemn an 
alleged iraqi chemical attack in which it says 1700 civilians were 
injured iran says most of the casualties were women and children 
no word emerged on whether the un chief would send another 
chemical weapons team to look into the latest allegation of iraqi 
atrocities in the war 
a un report released monday concluded that iraq had made 
repeated and extensive use of the outlawed weapons iraq has 
admitted using chemical weapons but denies the latest charge 
in a letter thursday velayati accused iraq of blatant 
disregard of the appeals made by the secretarygeneral and 
security council for an end to chemical weapons use 
he said that on tuesday at 245 am local time iraqi planes 
dropped eight bombs containing mustard gas in oshnaviyah a town in 
west azerbaijan province

president oscar arias hinted 
thursday that he may seek latin american support for a new 
diplomatic and economic initiative against nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government the bad guys 
speaking to a small group of foreign reporters in his office 
the costa rican leader said that central american countries not in 
compliance with his yearold peace plan should be punished 
arias said he would not issue his own full assessment of the 
peace plan until after he meets with fellow latin american 
presidents at the inauguration of ecuadors presidentelect 
rodrigo borja in quito next wednesday 
but he added my new initiative is to convince the other 
democracies that we must put pressure on the sandinistas to 
comply with the peace plan signed by nicaragua and the other four 
central american nations on aug 7 1987 
arias declined to elaborate 
at the time the plan was signed arias said he would ask the 
organization of american states and the united nations to apply 
economic sanctions against any country later found not to be in 
compliance the plan was to have taken effect last november 
the plan calls for talks aimed at ending civil wars in 
nicaragua el salvador and guatemala and measures toward 
democratization in all five countries arias won the 1987 nobel 
peace prize for authoring the plan 
arias acknowledged that none of the five countries including 
his own is in full compliance but reserved his strongest 
criticism for nicaragua his words were couched in perhaps the 
strongest language he has used against the managua government to 
date 
the sandinistas today are the bad guys not the good guys 
arias said they have unmasked themselves they have proven to 
the world that there is no political will in managua to comply 
with the accord they were not really honest when they committed 
themselves to democratize and to advance toward a pluralistic 
society 
arias referred to the arrest last month of about 40 
antisandinista protesters the temporary closing of the opposition 
daily newspaper la prensa and indefinite shutdown of the roman 
catholic radio station and the expulsion from nicaragua of us 
ambassador richard melton and seven other us diplomats 
arias said he opposed any further us military aid to the 
rebels known as contras who have been trying to overthrow the 
managua government for the past seven years he said he had no 
objections to humanitarian aid 
but arias said any nicaraguan government ruled by the contra 
leadership would likely be as bad as the sandinista regime the 
contras are not part of the solution he said they are part 
of the problem

art carney and barnard hughes a couple of irish 
actors who never had acted together before but who look enough 
alike to be brothers are now playing brothers on the 
cavanaughs 
after a year and a half on hiatus the cbs series returns monday 
night with a plotpacked sometimes touching half hour hughes 
plays pop cavanaugh who unlovingly refers to his brother as the 
weasel carney appears only in the first of eight new episodes 
ready to air he hopes to be in more after the writers strike ends 
in 1986 carneys daughter praised the cavanaughs so he 
watched i went after the part ive never done that before i 
called up my agent and said if the brother ever shows up id 
love to take a crack at it 
i used to mention him occasionally hughes said there was 
no brother in sight until you suggested it 
carney shot one episode in february 1987 the new one was shot 
in january 
the hardworking hughes traveled from montreal where hes 
shooting a cbs movie day one for a day of cananaughs 
promotion carney who is semiretired came from his home on the 
connecticut shore 
interviewing the pair is more like eavesdropping they 
reminisce compare notes and update family news much like 
brothers both married years ago stayed married have children 
carney has six grandchildren hughes none 
the conversation drifted to remembering names of actors on 
radios longago it pays to be ignorant 
this is why i love for you to come on the set hughes told 
carney 
tvs cavanaugh brothers are two years apart which is close to 
life ill be 70 in november said carney im 73 since july 
16 said hughes 
bob moloney writer and producer captures the flavor of the 
irish so beautifully carney said the humor of the irish is 
all there the stubborn qualities come through hes irish himself 
which helps this show wasnt too schmaltzy it was beautifully 
written 
thats one of the saving graces of the show it never goes too 
far in that area hughes added 
hughes parents were born in ireland carneys connections are 
more complicated my mothers name was fleming her mother was a 
farrell my grandmother on my fathers side was a quinn my wifes 
a myers a little bit of several things 
all my sisters and brothers married irish my wife helen 
stenborg is swedish i try to get her to use helen hughes when she 
acts but no go she wanted me to change my name to stenborg 
my wifes not in the business carney said we went steady 
four years in high school they dont use that expression any more 
we met in 1936 in mount vernon ny and got married in 1940 
helen and i went steady four years too hughes said we 
got married in 1950 you were very precocious werent you 
at the time carney recalled he worked for horace heidts band 
i got a break i auditioned and joined him eight months out of 
high school carney said i did imitations of fdr al smith 
wendell wilkie winston churchill fred allen jimmy durante 
edward g robinson and ned sparks a sourfaced comedic actor in 
motion pictures when i was a kid i said to my folks i can sound 
like ned sparks 
thank god for fdr that was my break getting into radio 
acting i did report to the nation sunday nights at cbs i would 
do a live impersonation of roosevelt quoting from his speeches i 
got confidence in myself to do some soap operas gangbusters 
counterspy that was a nice way to make a living 
i never did any radio hughes said da the stage play 
was like radio youd sit on these steps and people would imagine 
when we did the picture i sat on the real mountain and looked out 
over the real irish sea 
my friend over here arthur carney came to see da with his 
wife jean and forgot to wear his hearing aid he didnt hear a 
word thats the first time we met 
i had to go back to say hello and tell him how wonderful he 
was in a great play carney said 
thats when i realized what a phony he was said hughes who 
won a tony in 1978 for da 
with carney the conversation inevitably turns to his role as ed 
norton on the honeymooners with jackie gleason and hughes 
obliged by asking what it was like to work with the late great 
one 
i started with gleason in 1950 a couple of writers suggested 
me carney said gleason didnt know me from a hole in the 
ground i knew him from the life of riley he did that before 
william bendix 
i never thought norton should have been married he would 
drive ralph mad because he had a different girlfriend every night 
i still have the hat norton used to wear i got that hat at 
edsonlewis mens shop in mount vernon when i was in high school 
for 5 i thought i was springing for a nice hat it paid the bills 
for a good number of years

it was 1966 and joe mintz was 48 a very 
successful dallas life insurance salesman with a growing income and 
an expensive house then he became an industry critic a very 
successful one 
his later success is not in financial terms however the big 
house for example was sold and he and his wife live in a much 
smaller apartment now he lost a lot of his old insurance industry 
buddies too 
and much of the time he concedes his ideas have simply bounced 
off the industrys tough hide he talks of the frustration in 
obtaining understanding of his causes but far less action 
but he says i wake up every morning knowing it will be a 
good day he always sounds it too though a very severe critic 
and greatly upset by some life insurance practices he retains an 
outwardly serene demeanor 
part of it comes from experience since joe with his computer 
printouts was an important factor in developing individual 
retirement account legislation some of which to his chagrin has 
since been rescinded 
now 70 collecting social security and a small amount from his 
nearly inactive agency he continues to argue that the life 
insurance industry by choice fails to describe its products in 
ways most beneficial to customers 
at his own expense he attends insurance meetings sometimes as a 
speaker he needles state regulators he grabs the attention of 
consumer advocates and legislators he produces stacks of data and 
analyses from his computer 
while he is respected in the industry for speaking his mind he 
is feared too since he calmly strikes at some of the industrys 
most respected tenets even some of its moral precepts and does so 
in plain flatout language 
at his own expense for example he has just designed written 
printed and published a fourpage memorandum called how to 
discover your gold mine in which he assaults the dictum that you 
should never trade in your life insurance policy 
to the contrary he says it is often in your best interest to 
do so all at once he says you might release thousands of dollars 
in cash for your own use retain or improve your coverage and pay 
no further premiums 
here is an example 
the original life insurance policy would pay the beneficiary 
100000 upon death of the insured it required an annual premium 
to the insurance company of 1430 the policy contained 18700 in 
cash value 
it was discontinuued and three new policies purchased 
1 using the 18700 cash from the old policy a new 96000 
policy became available with no further premium payments required 
2 using 715 onehalf of the annual premium saved by switching 
policies a new additional 15000 policy was purchased and made 
payable to the original beneficiary 
3 using the remainder of the saved premium 715 a second 
15000 policy became available with benefits assigned to a home 
for the aged 
in this scenario which is constructed from actual marketplace 
data the original 100000 payable at death increases to 126000 
this and other situations he describes document the title of 
his fourpage memo available from gold mine box 12066 dallas 
texas 75225 for 2 he will send two copies for review by you and 
your insurance agent 
joe has a particular reason for suggesting you liberate your 
funds since rewards are common when one recovers a possession 
thought lost forever you may be willing to share these gains with 
a deserving organization 
such liberated money he says could be contributed to a church 
synagogue nursing home hospital school home for the aged or a 
charity of your choice including yourself share with them he 
says rather than with the insurer 
theoretically he says billions of dollars could be shared with 
needy institutions he does not consider the insurers to fit the 
category if people examined their policies

this summers drought has focused more 
attention on the greenhouse effect but an agricultural analyst 
says its impossible to predict whether the grain belt will be 
among the early losers from a global warming 
in an article published by resources for the future and the 
national center for food and agricultural policy norman j 
rosenberg also cautions against prematurely adjusting us 
agriculture to cope with potential changes in the climate 
one cannot rule out the possibility that some lands now too 
arid for cultivation of food crops may indeed become more usable 
for these purposes in the future writes rosenberg director of 
the climate resources program for resources for the future an 
independent research and education group 
however there is no more evidence to support that assumption 
than there is to support the idea popularized by the media that 
productive lands in the us midwest and great plains are certain 
to become drier and less productive 
still rosenberg strongly suggests that some agricultural 
efforts be vigorously continued as precautions against possible 
problems he also says more research is needed to develop 
techniques to help farming prepare for the natural ups and downs of 
climatic variations 
there is nothing in the predictions of the climate change 
community to suggest that we should reduce emphasis on soil and 
water conservation programs he writes 
rosenberg was a professor of agricultural meteorology and 
director of the center for agricultural meteorology and climatology 
at the university of nebraska before joining the washingtonbased 
organization last year 
the conservation reserve program and sodbuster provisions are 
likely to be needed as much in the future as they are today he 
writes 
conservation of groundwater should be emphasized especially 
in aquifers like the ogallalla that are only slowly rechargeable 
vast quantities of water in storage may provide a buffer to lessen 
the negative impacts of greater aridity in the midlatitudes of 
north america should climate change occur as some global climate 
models suggest 
the ogallala covers portions of great plains states from 
nebraska to texas and is primary source of irrigation for farming 
in an interview rosenberg expressed concerns that the current 
drought gripping portions of the grain belt has generated hype 
and sophistry about the greenhouse effect that increasing 
concentrations of carbon dioxide and other gases would cause a 
general warming of the atmosphere by trapping heat around the earth 
rosenberg contends the drought shouldnt be blamed on the 
greenhouse effect but is a product of natural variations in weather 
patterns 
however he says the drought should serve as a lesson for policy 
makers and as an indicator of the kinds of severe weather changes 
that could occur more frequently in the future if the greenhouse 
effect manifests itself as some have suggested 
i think the people who are using this years drought as some 
kind of omen of the greenhouse effect are doing us a bit of a 
disservice because this drought is not at all unprecedented 
says rosenberg but the drought does drive home the point that 
were very vulnerable and climate change can make us more 
vulnerable 
rosenberg says he is reasonably convinced that the 
greenhouse effect is responsible for the gradual warming trend that 
has occurred worldwide but he says scientists lack the ability to 
accurately predict the regional effects of a continuation of that 
warming past greenhouse effect studies have predicted widely 
ranging temperature and precipitation changes 
for example a stateoftheart study by the energy 
department in 1985 projected temperature increases for the middle 
of north america from 2 degrees to 8 degrees celsius depending 
upon which scientific model was used by researchers 
in his article rosenberg says there are indicators that 
agriculture can adjust to some of the predicted climatic changes 
he points to the expansion of the nations winterwheat growing 
region since 1920 
hard red winter wheat is grown in the northern plains including 
montana where average temperatures are lower the growing season 
shorter and there is less rainfall than traditional areas like 
kansas that expansion rosenberg says has occurred over a 
climatic gradient greater in many ways than the greenhouse 
changes predicted in some studies 
still rosenberg says the current drought illustrates how modern 
agriculture remains extremely vulnerable to weatherrelated 
stresses he contends that more emphasis should be placed on 
research to develop crops and techniques that minimize that 
vulnerability 
that he says is the best strategy for agriculture to prepare 
for what the greenhouse effect could bring 
even if the whole greenhouse effect would turn out to be a 
misconception but we had invested a lot more in research to 
fortify agriculture against climatic variability natural 
variability wed still be coming out ahead says rosenberg

republican leaders say their 1988 platform 
will hew closely to the conservative lines of their 1984 model on 
taxes defense and the deficit while adding new language on drugs 
education child care and other issues george bush hopes to 
champion 
bush will seek to put his personal stamp on the platform monday 
when he journeys to new orleans to testify before the platform 
writers a week before the opening of the republican national 
convention 
he has signaled that he wants this platform to echo most of the 
positions the party took in 1984 when republicans in dallas 
categorically rejected any tax increases endorsed a lineitem veto 
and balanced budget amendment eschewed an equal rights amendment 
and promised to appoint judges at all levels who respect 
traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life 
the democrats approved a 5200word platform at their convention 
last month after rejecting minority planks calling for higher taxes 
on corporations and the wealthy and for a pledge not to be the 
first to use nuclear weapons 
president reagan has accused the democrats of trying to hide 
their liberal positions in a plain brownwrapper platform that 
skirts any mention of how to pay for the ideas the democrats 
support 
frank fahrenkopf jr the republican party chairman said in a 
telephone interview from his lake tahoe nev home i do not see 
at this point in time any major platform fights shaping up 
calling the platform the soul of the party fahrenkopf 
promised we intend to be specific on the issues and not to try 
to mislead the american people with a piece of puff 
new hampshire gov john h sununu a close bush adviser and 
platform committee member said the republicans need to update 
their plank on arms control and give added emphasis to such issues 
as education the environment and child care 
charles black the bush campaigns platform liaison said the 
vice president and the leadership of the platform committee are in 
agreement that we ought to use the 84 platform as a guiding 
document update it but keep most of the principles in it 
aids wasnt even in there in 84 said black who added that 
he expects the republicans will have more to say this time about 
the war on drugs 
by testifying in person bush is sending a message that unlike 
michael dukakis whos ducking the issues we are running on the 
issues black said 
nebraska gov kay orr is chairman of the 106member platform 
committee or the committee on resolutions as it is known in 
official gop convention parlance sen bob kasten of wisconsin and 
rep jerry lewis of california are cochairmen and new jersey 
assembly speaker chuck hardwick is vicechairman 
donald j devine head of an ad hoc conservative coalition 
called the committee to save the reagan platform said 
everything seems to be going in the direction that we want 
he predicted the platform will strongly support the strategic 
defense initiative and the contra rebels in nicaragua and take a 
hard line against abortion 
devine said writing the plank on aids might be a problem not 
ideologically but just the complexity of the subject 
but as far as were concerned things seem to be going on 
track said devine if theres any trouble it will probably 
come from the moderates side not the conservatives 
there were no minority planks at either the 1980 or 1984 gop 
conventions that nominated reagan and bush 
in 1984 a handful of liberal republicans on the platform 
committee led by sen lowell p weicker of connecticut were 
unable to muster the 27 committee votes needed to press floor 
fights on such issues as the equal rights amendment weicker is on 
the platform committee again this year 
a new jersey congressman james courter said he will press for 
adoption of a civil rights plank committing the gop to end racial 
discrimination wherever it exists 
courter wants to see a landmark 1976 civil rights case runyon 
v mccrary transformed into law the supreme court recently 
stirred a controvery when it voted 54 to reconsider that case 
which guaranteed the right of minorities to sue over discrimination 
in housing jobs and other areas 
the republican platform writers will get a staffproduced 
distillation of views that committee leaders heard at hearings in 
washington kansas city mo and los angeles over the past 4 
months 
but that is merely giving them a piece of paper to work 
from not a proposed draft like the ted sorensenwritten document 
that the democrats worked from said barbara i pardue the press 
secretary for the gop convention 
the committee will vote on a proposed platform by friday or 
saturday if necessary then formally approve it monday after the 
convention opens and submit it to an upordown vote by the entire 
convention tuesday 
each state the district of columbia and puerto rico places one 
man and one woman on the committee guam and the virgin islands 
send single representatives 
fahrenkopf whose party produced a 32000word platform in 1984 
said there is no way the republicans will produce a document as 
short as the democrats 
but he added i would hope that we can say it shorter than 
32000 words

eastern airlines executives say they may 
appeal a federal judges order temporarily blocking the carrier 
from slashing its operations and laying off 4000 workers 
in a ruling that put into disarray the companys plans to prune 
its operations aug 31 us district judge barrington d parker 
agreed wednesday to a request by easterns unions to block the 
cutbacks temporarily 
he tentatively scheduled a hearing for today at which the 
duration of the courts red light will be discussed on wednesday 
he issued a temporary restraining order which usually lasts no 
more than 10 days 
on july 22 the financially reeling airline announced plans to 
lay off 12 percent of its 32200 workers and eliminate 140 of its 
1225 daily flights 
eastern would end almost all operations at kansas city mo its 
main hub in the western united states dramatically reduce service 
at its eastern hub of philadelphia and eliminate flights to 14 
cities the airline would focus its service on the east coast and 
latin america 
david boies an attorney for eastern said it would be a 
prescription for disaster for the airline to consider continuing 
its operations in kansas city 
another eastern lawyer michael madigan said eastern lost 68 
million in kansas city last year and 33 million in the first three 
months of 1988 in all he said the airline has lost more than 1 
billion since 1980 including 194 million in 1987 and 31 million 
in the first quarter of this year 
we are continuing to suffer heavy financial losses and 
therefore we will give an appeal immediate and serious 
consideration eastern spokesman robin matell said when the 
session ended 
lawyers for the three unions representing eastern employees 
however insisted that the cutbacks were just the latest in a 
series of efforts by the company to weaken labor by shrinking the 
airline 
theyre engaged in a plan designed if they dont get from 
labor what they want the ultimate demise of eastern said robert 
a burka lawyer for the international association of machinists 
and aerospace workers representing baggage handlers and other 
ground workers 
the airline is engaged in contract talks with the machinists and 
with the air line pilots association and has made it clear that it 
is seeking reductions in wages 
management has proposed a series of sales of eastern assets in 
recent months to other subsidiaries of texas air corp which is 
also easterns parent company unions have claimed that 
managements goal is to strip eastern and shift business to 
continental airlines a texas air subsidiary that is nonunion 
labor already has blocked one such proposal in court a plan to 
sell the airlines profitable shuttle serving the northeast 
eastern executives have argued that the deal would have produced 
cash for the carrier 
joseph guerrieri jr another attorney for the machinists told 
parker that union lawyers had uncovered a smoking gun eastern 
memo laying out the companys plans to sell assets and containing 
estimates of how damaging each deal would be to labor 
the plan to sell the shuttle for example was described as 
having maximum shock value on the unions the document was 
submitted to parker under seal 
boies conceded that the memo had come from management but he 
told the judge that most of whats talked about there was never 
done 
during the 3hour hearing lawyers for the machinists the 
pilots and the transport workers union which represents flight 
attendants argued that federal labor laws and the unions 
contracts forbade cutbacks without bargaining 
company attorneys claimed that such paring is allowed and that 
they occur all the time 
hubs have been opened and closed in the airline industry since 
deregulation very frequently said madigan referring to the 1978 
law that diminished the federal governments role in overseeing air 
service 
but when the session ended parker said that a sufficient 
threat of injury to the unions exists which in the judgment of 
this court warrants issuance of the temporary restraining order 
according to the company the layoffs would include 1000 flight 
attendants 1000 baggage handlers and other ground workers 1000 
nonunionized workers 500 management and supervisory jobs and up 
to 500 pilots 
in miami where eastern is headquartered the flight 
attendants proposed a plan wednesday that would use jobsharing and 
leaves to save their jobs the company rejected the plan saying it 
would cost more money

hollywood erupted in joy when negotiators 
announced a tentative settlement of the 150dayold writers strike 
that has affected everyone from tv stars to delicatessen owners to 
television viewers 
wednesdays announcement of a settlement between the writers 
guild of america and the producers alliance signaled an end to 
what had become one of the longest strikes in modern hollywood 
history surpassed only by the guilds 1960 walkout of five months 
its been a very very difficult summer for all of us because 
nobody has been in control of this said producer stephen j 
cannell im glad theres a solution now or appears to be i got 
the 3in1 oil out and my typewriter is ready to go 
as a responsible human being im thrilled its over said 
linda bloodworththomason who wrote all 22 episodes of her 
designing women series last season on a personal level im 
getting real attached to my hammock 
i am relieved that the strike is over and so is my family i 
can start earning some money again i have two assignments that i 
am waiting to complete said ic rapoport who wrote the cbs 
television movie cook and peary race to the pole 
besides writers and producers the walkout hurt restaurant 
owners talent agencies performers awaiting work and ordinary tv 
viewers 
the starting dates for the fall season were left in question as 
the strike ate into the first month of the normal production 
schedule 
most producers estimated they could get shows on the air in 
sixeight weeks after a settlement 
were all champing at the bit to go back to work said 
actress betty white of nbcs the golden girls 
cbs could begin broadcasting new shows the third week of 
october kim lemasters president of cbs entertainment said 
shortly before announcement of the settlement returning shows and 
halfhour comedies were most likely to hit the air first followed 
by new hourlong dramas he said 
abc entertainment president brandon stoddard said a contract 
would leave his network able to premiere most of our fall 
schedule either before after or combined with the miniseries 
war and remembrance in november 
stoddard said premiere dates would be announced soon abc 
already said it would delay its premieres until after nbcs 
combined fall schedule of the summer olympics and world series had 
ended but left in question when the new season would actually 
start 
many people dependent on business from the film and television 
industry felt the strikes impact 
newt bellis president of unitel a major postproduction 
operation on the lot of paramount studios called his losses 
dramatic 
we dropped to a third of what we projected for may june and 
july he said 
i hope its not too little too late i hope that we can swing 
into action soon enough to retain some of the television season 
unitel which handles editing and sound dubbing for such shows 
as family ties also has offices in new york and pittsburgh 
bellis said television commercial work at the eastern offices 
kept the hollywood plant afloat during the strike but he still had 
to dismiss a few workers 
during frequent and lengthy bargaining sessions at the producers 
alliance headquarters both sides snacked on trays from arts deli 
in studio city a major schmoozeanddeal eatery 
but even that highticket account of hungry negotiators failed 
to make up owner art ginsburgs losses as regular customers 
tightened belts 
we had to let three employees go and now we will be able to 
pull them back said an ecstatic ginsburg on wednesday 
ginsburg said business was down 20 percent and orders were down 
by 100 dozen bagels 100 pounds of cream cheese and 150 dozen eggs 
at the william morris agency one of the industrys oldest and 
largest talent houses agents were told to hold down costs during 
the strike said roger davis executive vice president and a member 
of the board of directors 
we tried to cut expenses on a voluntary plan he said 
there were less luncheons less general entertainment cheaper 
wine whatever 
the agency managed to avoid layoffs and kept active with deals 
on concerts books and personal appearances which do not depend on 
guildwritten scripts said davis 
but the tendency of big buyers to get motion picture rights to 
the more expensive books fell off because people were not willing 
to expend large amounts of money without knowing how long this 
would go on said davis of the strike

the federal government is on the verge of 
issuing racketeering indictments against a senior employee and a 
former employee of drexel burnham lambert inc as well as several 
employees of a new jersey investment firm according to published 
reports today 
the reports in the wall street journal and the baltimore sun 
said attorneys for the likely defendants characterize the charges 
as largely technical and based on an unprecedented use of the 
racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
the attorneys told the sun that prosecutors are trying to coerce 
testimony against bigger fish at goldman sachs amp co and 
drexel firms with which the new jersey firm princetonnewport 
partners lp had dealings 
princetonnewport based in princeton nj and newport beach 
calif specializes in hedge transactions aimed at profiting from 
the spreads in the prices of convertible stocks and debentures 
the journal identified one of those expected to be indicted as 
james sutton regan a general managing partner of 
princetonnewport along with three or four general partners it 
quoted regans lawyer theodore wells as saying his client is 
innocent and will vigorously contest any charges that may be filed 
the journal said two people employed at drexel at the time of 
the transactions are also expected to be charged bruce newberg a 
former trader in drexels beverly hills calif office who 
recently left the firm and cary maltausch a current employee of 
drexels new york office 
spokesmen for princetonnewport and drexel were said to be in 
meetings thursday morning and not immediately available for comment 
if the grand jury votes an indictment princetonnewport would 
be the first securities firm ever charged as a racketeering 
enterprise but would probably not itself be named as a defendant 
the journal said 
drexel itself is not expected to be charged with any wrongdoing 
the journal said drexels junk bond division which has 
revolutionized wall street in the 1980s by dramatically increasing 
the reach and implications of corporate debt has been the focus of 
extensive government probes 
the indictment reflects a significant escalation in tactics used 
by the government to prosecute wall street executives 
under the criminal rico law passed in 1970 to combat organized 
crime and drugs a person or business that commts two or more 
felonies as part of a pattern can be charged with racketeering 
the law carries severe penalties including as much as 20 years 
in prison and the confiscation of property and earnings even if 
they are unrelated to wrongdoing 
the department of justice is threatening to chop off feet to 
get what they want regardless of whether its true paul grand 
attorney for charles zarvecki general partner and head of trading 
of princetonnewport told the sun 
rudolph giuliani the us attorney for the southern district 
of new york believes the threat of racketeering charges is so 
potent that its use will bring anyone to his knees 
the sun said the case centers on three charges 
the first involves complex tax issues arising out of the hedging 
techniques used by princetonnewport specifically it concerns how 
losses were recognized 
the second revolves around alleged parking in mattel stock 
in 1984 princetonnewport bought a position from drexel of between 
05 percent and 1 percent of the southern california toymakers 
stock which it sold back to drexel in 1985 stock parking is when 
one holds a stock for another to conceal the true ownership 
the third charge is likely to be based on the contention that at 
the behest of drexel employees princetonnewport tried to 
manipulate the price of comb a company that deals in 
distressed merchandise

ford motor co will spend nearly 
35 billion to modernize 15 north american assembly and 
manufacturing plants and may build new plants as part of an 
expanded product investment plan ford vice chairman harold a 
poling says 
we are building on our product successes and following a 
strategy of stepbystep improvements at existing facilities 
poling said wednesday at the university of michigans management 
briefing seminars 
he said the company will decide by the end of the year whether 
demand for its vehicles justifies adding new plants 
ford has sought to conserve cash and cultivate employee goodwill 
in the past five years by renovating existing facilities rather 
than building at new empty green field locations 
but when youve reached a point where you see a sustained 
demand for your products above that which you could provide on the 
basis that weve been providing then youve got to consider a 
green field site poling said and we will were looking at 
it 
the improvements are part of a worldwide fiveyear investment 
plan that will see the automaker spend significantly more than the 
166 billion spent during the previous fiveyear period poling 
said 
eight of the 15 improvements under way or scheduled to begin 
this year are at plants in michigan scheduled to be modernized 
are livonia transmission dearborn assembly romeo engine wayne 
stamping assembly and the truck plant wixom assembly and 
ypsilanti 
other plants to be updated are st louis assembly louisville 
assembly buffalo ny stamping plant lorain ohio assembly 
walton hills ohio stamping sharonville ohio and connersville 
ind 
we believe our modernized plants are stateoftheart and we 
are gaining productivity advantages with very efficient 
investment poling said 
since introducing its 1985 models ford has increased its annual 
north american assembly capacity by 500000 units greater line 
speeds additional work shifts and the upgrading of equipment 
contributed to the increase in productivity poling said 
ford reported record profits of 166 billion in the second 
quarter of 1988 company officials said 
poling said investment alone is not the way to make sure profits 
increase adding that the automaker must also follow a threepart 
agenda 
one and this can never be overemphasized we must continue to 
focus on the basics two we must accept change and deal with it in 
new more imaginative and more efficient ways and three our 
industry and government must work more cooperatively and 
effectively to achieve mutual goals poling said

four of ibp incs meatpacking plants passed 
detailed safety and health inspections by state and federal 
officials ibp chairman robert l peterson said in the companys 
1987 annual report 
those inspections resulted in no headlines peterson said 
in contrast to big headlines that followed allegations in july 1987 
by the occupational safety and health administration 
osha levied a 259 million fine at ibps dakota city 
headquarters plant alleging that ibp did not report worker 
injuries there 
we are vigorously appealing oshas dakota city recordkeeping 
assessment which we believe is in error peterson said we 
expect to be vindicated 
ibp works hard to safeguard its employees the report said 
we will put our track record on the line against any other 
meatpacker in the country it is a matter of common human decency 
to be concerned about the safety of employees in addition it 
happens to make good business sense 
unions representing ibp workers have long contended the 
companys plants are unsafe 
the inspections the four plants passed included safety practices 
and employee protection during actual operations peterson said 
the annual report was the first by the company since its stock 
became available for public ownership last october occidental 
petroleum corp had owned ibp for six years and retains a 505 
percent ownership 
the report said a sevenmonth labor dispute last year at the 
dakota city plant had a satisfactory resolution but together with 
startup costs for three new pork plants cost the company nearly 
20 million 
the strike ended with an eightyear labor agreement peterson 
said will stabilize the companys labor situation 
we regret the continued confrontations at dakota city he 
said however we have the obligation at ibp to manage for the 
longterm profitable growth of our business this will ultimately 
benefit our employees as well as our stockholders 
he said the company had pretax losses of 49 million in 1987 
from starting operations at new pork facilities at louisa county 
and council bluffs iowa and madison the plants now are 
profitable and are expected to be major contributors to ibps 
earnings growth he said

scriptwriters say they can probably start 
work on a delayed fall tv season by next week giving viewers hope 
of relief from reruns after a tentative agreement to end the 
22week strike by 9000 writers 
leaders of the writers guild of america voted late wednesday to 
urge union members to accept the proposed contract despite what 
union negotiators acknowledged were concessions on key issues 
thank god isnt that wonderful news were all champing at 
the bit to go back to work said actress betty white the 
emmywinning star of nbctvs the golden girls 
the settlement announced wednesday signaled the end to one of 
the longest and most painful strikes in modern hollywood history 
surpassed only by the guilds 1960 walkout which lasted 23 weeks 
one hollywood agent predicted a flood of work from writers who 
have been forbidden by strike rules to submit scripts to producers 
it will be weird for a few weeks there will be such a rush to 
the marketplace such an overabundance of material that it will 
confuse the studios said martin bauer of the bauer benedeck 
agency 
despite the settlement the start of the fall tv season will be 
delayed perhaps until november costs to the networks will be 
extraordinary and could range into tens of millions of dollars 
writers estimated their losses were in the millions of dollars 
and thousands of people employed in all parts of the entertainment 
industry suffered layoffs because of production shutdowns 
the dispute reached beyond writers actors directors editors 
and stage hands hollywoods ancillary industries including 
equipment rental and film processing 
restaurants popular in the entertainment industry had to lay off 
waiters business at dry cleaners hair salons and messengers 
slowed even the commissary at universal studios was closed because 
of lost income 
george kirgo president of the guilds west coast unit said the 
leadership voted 256 to recommend that the rankandfile ratify 
the contract one member abstained if the union members approve 
the pact when they vote sunday they could return to work by 
monday kirgo said 
it was time to bring it to a conclusion and the deal was 
there said chief union negotiator brian walton 
we are very pleased to have reached a tentative agreement 
said nicholas counter iii chief negotiator for the alliance of 
motion picture and television producers no one wins a strike 
but one guild negotiator del reisman acknowledged very mixed 
feelings about the settlement he said the writers failed to 
achieve one of their key aims a substantial improvement in payment 
for reruns of television shows broadcast in foreign markets 
however guild leaders feared that prolonging the strike and 
longer could weaken the union said reisman vice president of the 
west coast guild unit 
the guild did win improvements in creative control over scripts 
and the reacquisition of original screenplays he said 
we wound up with an equation that was actually less than most 
of us hoped for reisman said but it is the first improvement 
in 18 years 
the settlement came after a collapse of talks last weekend 
produced two days of intense efforts by a variety of 
intermediaries contract issues were resolved during a 12hour 
meeting between walton and counter 
reisman said guild leaders instructed walton on monday to go 
out and get a deal and make it the best that you can 
the guild which began the strike march 7 has 9000 members 
most in southern california the alliance has 217 member companies 
responsible for 85 percent of network primetime television and 90 
percent of feature film production and distribution 
losses to guild writers were estimated at 500000 each strike 
week and the guild paid out more than 2 million in hardship loans 
to its members 
cbs could begin broadcasting new shows the third week of 
october kim lemasters president of cbs entertainment said 
shortly before announcement of the settlement 
abc entertainment president brandon stoddard said a contract 
would leave his network able to premiere most of our fall 
schedule either before after or combined with the miniseries 
war and remembrance in november 
abc already said it would delay its premieres until after nbcs 
combined fall schedule of the summer olympics and world series had 
ended but left in question when the new season would actually 
start 
nbc had no immediate comment

some 2600 rail workers went on strike after the 
morning rush hour today but were back on the job two hours later 
in time for the evening commute after congress quickly imposed a 
coolingoff period 
the strike against the chicago and north western transportation 
co idled 4900 other union workers who honored picket lines in 
chicago kansas city and otrher sites and halted service in 
chicago and elsewhere in the midwest 
the railroad serves 41000 commuters a day in the nations 
thirdlargest city and moves freight on 6400 miles of track in 10 
midwestern states 
the strike by 2600 members of the united transportation union 
originally scheduled to begin shortly after midnight was delayed 
several hours after campnw agreed to postpone the elimination of the 
jobs of 1156 train brakemen 
the brakemen and conductors went back to work shortly after 
congress on a unanimous voice vote passed a bill extending a 
coolingoff period in the dispute to sept 9 
the plan had been worked out among representatives of the 
railroad the union and members of illinois congressional 
delegation 
sen paul simon and rep terry bruce both illinois democrats 
said they expected president reagan to sign the measure this 
afternoon 
during the coolingoff period the union may not strike and the 
company is prohibited from eliminating any jobs bruce said 
the dispute centers on a campnw plan to cut most of its train 
crews from four to two workers 
donald markgraf general chairman of the railroad workers union 
said he supported the extended coolingoff period and was 
optimistic the dispute could be resolved 
i think there should be more time to negotiate this issue 
markgraf said all disputes have got to be resolved some day im 
not trying to start strikes 
some commuters faced delays up to 15 minutes today because of 
vandalism to signal equipment said james foote a spokesman for 
cnw corp the railroads parent company foote refused to 
speculate on who may have caused the damage 
commuters were relieved that the strike was delayed until after 
rush hour 
i would have had to take two buses and an el train to get to 
work said duane stewart a purchasing manager adding that it 
would have taken him an extra hour i was really not looking 
forward to this morning 
in april reagan issued an executive order barring either side 
from taking action until 30 days after a presidential emergency 
board submitted recommendations for a settlement 
the presidential board recommended last month that campnw cut one 
brakeman per train as a compromise and that elimination of the 
second should be decided through binding arbitration on a 
trainbytrain basis 
the railroad initially rejected the proposal but then offered 
monday to accept it in hopes of averting a strike union officials 
rejected that offer 
were not optimistic anything will change said cnw 
spokesman fred bloedorn but weve agreed to give it a chance

the house today passed the only tax bill 
congress is likely to consider this year a relatively modest 
effort that offers relief for a variety of special interests and 
tax increases for others 
the vote was 38025 with solid support from both parties the 
bill now goes to the senate 
this bill is in keeping with the spirit of tax reform 
enacted in 1986 said rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of 
the house ways and means committee he noted the bulk of the new 
legislation aims to correct errors and clear up confusion in that 
new law which lowered tax rates and increased income subject to 
taxation 
the bill would provide special breaks for rural mail carriers 
freelance writers firsttime homebuyers and farmers and other 
offroad users of diesel fuel 
to pay for those tax reductions the bill would put the bite on 
pipe smokers defense contractors corporations that own other 
corporations some farmers and certain people who claim deductions 
for maintaining an office in their home 
at 960 pages the bill is almost as lengthy as the landmark 1986 
law but in dollar terms it is one of the smallest pieces of tax 
legislation in recent years the joint committee on taxation 
estimates it would cut taxes by about 71 billion through 1991 and 
raise taxes by about 47 million less 
in the senate the finance committee has produced a much leaner 
version the senate measure contains little more than corrections 
of the 1986 errors and the dieselfuel provision demanded by 
farmers 
because of the need to fix some ambiguities in the 1986 law the 
reagan administration wants to see the bill enacted this year as 
do accountants and other tax professionals 
here are some of the provisions in the house bill 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a tax exclusion for the first 1500 a year of employerpaid 
educational assistance for undergraduate study would be renewed for 
1989 and 1990 it expired in 1987 
farmers construction companies and other offroad users of 
diesel would be exempted from paying the federal tax of 151 cents 
a gallon present law requires them to pay it and apply for a 
refund at year end

chubb group of insurance cos purchased 
newspaper advertising space across the nation thursday to repeat 
its denial that it reneged on a drought insurance offer to farmers 
in the parched midwest 
chubb said it is cooperating with state officials investigating 
complaints stemming from a dispute in which its warrenbased 
subsidiary federal insurance co is accused of backing off a 
promise tn issue policies that pay off if rainfall is below a 
certain level 
recently because of issues related to the rain insurance 
controversy our reputation has been under public attack for the 
first time in our history said chubbs fullpage advertisement 
that ran in more than 30 newspapers and various publications around 
the country 
chubb says the policies were sold through an agent for federal 
insurance and expected they would offer about 30 million in total 
coverage but the agent good weather international received more 
than 8700 applications for drought coverage totalling 370 million 
chubbs ad details how the controversy developed and said a 
flood of 6000 applications in the final days of the enrollment 
period exceeded the amount of policies it wanted to sign as a 
result the company said it could not fill all the applications 
we said that applications were not binding on chubb until 
accepted and that premiums must be submitted with applications 
because of the shortterm nature of the policy chubbs ad says 
its not unusual in the agricultural business for applications 
to accompany a premium check because of the short duration of the 
coverage said mary lu korkuch a company spokeswoman its not 
like homeowners insurance which is a continuous renewal type of 
policy 
farmers in 10 states ohio minnesota indiana iowa illinois 
kentucky michigan missouri tennessee and wisconsin applied for 
the insurance as they contend with one of the worst dry spells in 
history some have filed lawsuits against the company over the 
disputed insurance and state officials also have threatened legal 
action 
unfortunately much of what you may have read or seen about 
chubb and rain insurance in recent weeks is misleading and a lot 
is simply wrong the ad says because that information goes 
directly to our reputation for keeping our word which is 
fundamental to the product we sell we must set the record 
straight 
chubb had spoken with 5000 farmers as of early thursday and had 
plans to talk with the other 3711 who applied for the insurance by 
the end of the week ms korkuch said 
out of 5000 there have been five people who have refused to 
deal with us of course were very encouraged by that she 
said 
after talking with state insurance commissioners chubb 
announced in midmay that it would issue a total of 40 million in 
drought coverage 10 million more than it had initially planned 
but that was expected to cover only 10 percent or about 800 of 
the farmers who had applied the company said sixthousand others 
who did not receive coverage would get twice the amount of their 
premium returned chubb has said 
so far 600 policies have been issued and 70 farmers have asked 
for the double premium payment ms korkuch said 
g terry van gilder deputy chief underwriting officer for the 
group told a state insurance hearing wednesday in ohio that chubb 
didnt realize good weather oversold chubbs drought insurance 
until one day before the deadline for applications 
chubb said in its newspaper ads that its decision to return 
premiums was made as soon as we knew how oversubscribed good 
weathers program was 
the advertisement offered no new proposals from the company but 
said we intend to continue to deal fairly and responsibly with 
the farmers involved 
ms korkuch said the company based this years total coverage 
estimate on last years application response chubb received 1000 
applications and issued 5 million in coverage in 1987 the first 
year the drought insurance was offered she said 
chubb had sold 15 million in drought coverage onehalf of its 
maximum for the insurance by june 12 but the amount applied for 
had risen to 370 million three days later van gilder said

the federal communications commission on 
thursday revived a proposal to allow national television networks 
to own cable tv systems 
the fcc originally proposed eliminating the networkcable 
crossownership rule in 1982 but never acted on the plan 
the rule was adopted in 1970 when the cable tv industry was in 
its infancy because of fears that the tv networks would buy up 
cable systems and control their programming 
the fcc noted that a report by the commerce departments 
national telecommunications information and administration in june 
recommended the rule be abolished the report said the tv networks 
influence has diminished significantly since the rule was adopted 
the agencys three sitting commissioners voted unanimously to 
seek comment again on the proposal to update the record so the 
agency can consider eliminating the rule but one commissioner 
expressed reservations 
commissioner james h quello said he feared that without rules 
requiring cable systems to carry local broadcast signals a 
networkowned cable system could disadvantage the local competition 
by dropping the stations from its cable menu 
chairman dennis r patrick said he doubted that a networkowned 
cable system would risk alienating viewers by dropping a popular 
channel from its lineup it would be an economic disincentive 
he said 
james p mooney president of the national cable television 
association said the commissions proposal to eliminate the rule 
is reasonable because conditions have changed so much since 
1970 
the fcc also proposed scrapping a rule that limits the term of 
affiliation agreements between networks and stations to a maximum 
of two years 
this rule was adopted nearly 50 years ago for the radio industry 
and then applied to tv in 1945 as a way to assist new networks in 
gaining access to broadcast outlets

a major trade bill awaiting president reagans signature was 
labeled protectionist on thursday by several of americas leading 
trade partners who warned that the legislation could harm 
international relations 
the senate approved the bill wednesday by an 8511 vote the 
measure aimed at reviving us competitiveness abroad cleared the 
house of representatives earlier and president reagan has 
indicated he will sign it 
reagan vetoed a previous version of the bill in part because it 
contained a controversial plantclosing notification requirement 
earlier this week reagan decided not to veto a separate 
plantclosing bill 
major us trading partners stated their opposition to the trade 
bills provision that would make it easier for the us government 
to impose import curbs in retaliation for alleged unfair trading 
practices by other nations 
many of the nations that complained the bill is protectionist 
are accused by the united states of being protectionist themselves 
for using high tariffs quotas or other barriers to imports 
in the far east where the reaction was mostly negative the 
leaders of japan and south korea urged reagan to veto the bill 
japanese prime minister noboru takeshita said i think its 
unfortunate because the bill contains protectionist overtones 
trade minister hajime tamura said japan would monitor 
implementation of the bill to ensure it did not violate 
international trade regulations 
although the united states has registered trade deficits with 
each of east asias most powerful economies japan south korea 
taiwan and hong kong its biggest concern lies with japan last 
year 60 billion of the 170 billion us trade deficit lay with 
japan which has been the target of previous retaliatory sanctions 
south koreas foreign ministry issued a statement saying it 
deeply regretted the bills passage and called for its elimination 
it is the strong hope that the us administration will 
once again demonstrate its firm commitment to free trade by taking 
appropriate measures not to allow such a protectionist bill to be 
enacted the ministry said 
taiwans board of foreign trade said it was gravely 
concerned because the bill indicates the united states is going 
to move away from free trade and move to the practice of 
protectionism 
the bill extended the definition of unfair trade to the areas of 
exchange rate trade surplus labor rights and copyright 
violations the statement said 
in europe west germanys economics minister martin bangemann 
said the bill could turn out to be a strong burden on free 
international trade 
he appealed to the reagan administration to implement the 
policies outlined in the trade bill with as much restraint as 
possible 
even before the senate vote britains financial times said in 
an editorial that trading partners of the united states have 
reason to be nervous 
in their future dealings with the us administration they 
will almost certainly have to accept that it is armed with a tough 
new mandate to promote us exports by systematically forcing open 
foreign markets under threat of sanctions the newspaper said 
the british government had no immediate comment 
only officials in hong kong officials took a more positive view 
tony miller hong kongs acting trade director said the british 
colony welcomed the bill to the extent that it will reduce some 
of the pentup protectionist pressures in congress 
but hong kong officials also expressed concern about a provision 
calling for an investigation into unfair trade practices by foreign 
nations 
the bill also would bar japans toshiba corp from selling goods 
to the us government for three years as a penalty for a 
subsidiarys export of hightechnology milling machines to the 
soviet union 
the 50 percentowned subsidiary toshiba machine co also would 
be prohibited from selling products commercially in the united 
states for the same period 
joichi aoi president of toshiba corp said it was unacceptable 
that the us government planned to punish a foreign company that 
had not violated any american laws 
a company spokesman also quoted aoi as saying it was improper 
for the united states to impose a punishment for a past event with 
a new law 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity estimated 
toshiba corp would suffer direct losses of about 50 million a 
year while indirect damage would be substantial

corn and soybean futures closed sharply higher 
thursday on the chicago board of trade on prospects for continued 
hot dry weather in the droughtstricken farm belt 
wheat and oat futures also advanced but not as strongly as corn 
and soybeans which soared their permitted daily limits late in the 
session before profittaking trimmed the gains analysts said 
the markets had opened higher in reaction to the national 
weather services 6to10day forecast for abovenormal 
temperatures and belownormal rainfall next week in the midwest 
where stunted soybean plants are struggling to produce and fill 
bean pods 
morning forecasts for scattered showers late thursday and friday 
had kept tight reins on the early rally 
but at midday some private meteorologists reduced the amount of 
rain in their nearterm forecasts triggering an explosion in 
demand for corn and soybean contracts 
the main influence was those weather forecasts for the next 
few days said victor lespinasse a trader for dean witter 
reynolds inc 
at the close wheat was 1 cent to 4 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 382 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to 7 cents higher with september at 304 a bushel 
oats were 2 cents to 4 cents higher with september at 286 a 
bushel and soybeans were 7 cents to 27 cents higher with august 
at 863 a bushel

business productivity in the second quarter 
deteriorated at a rate unequalled since 1981 the government 
reported thursday prompting some analysts to predict major 
troubles ahead for the economys competitive vigor 
the efficiency of nonfarm businesses in producing goods and 
services declined 17 percent in april through june its first 
decrease since 1986 and the biggest decline since 1981 the labor 
departments bureau of labor statistics said 
productivity had risen at an annual rate of 34 percent in the 
first three months of 1988 and had been improving at a rate of 1 
percent to 2 percent annually in the previous three years 
reflecting the strong economic expansion output of goods and 
services by those businesses responsible for threefourths of us 
economic activity rose 47 percent in the second quarter 
but to achieve that growth companies increased their work hours 
by 65 percent hiring hundreds of thousands of new employees to 
send the unemployment rate to a 14year low of 53 percent 
to some extent the job growth is coming at the expense of 
productivity said larry chimerine president of the wfa group of 
bala cynwyd pa its the big issue because if this trend 
continues were not going to see any improvement in living 
standards 
allen sinai chief economist for the bston co a new york 
consulting firm said the deterioration in productivity is the 
first hard evidence of a shortage of skills among newly hired 
workers 
we are scraping the bottom of the barrel so to speak of new 
labor market entrants whose skills and training may not be 
sufficient for using the new data processing and communications 
technologies that are dominating service industries sinai said 
calling the development a major change from the past six or 
seven years sinai said a whole new range of government policies 
beyond fiscal and money supply management are now needed 
literacy retraining the ability to work with machines is 
now much more important to keeping inflation down and productivity 
up he said 
meanwhile the labor department said labor costs soared 59 
percent in the second quarter the largest gain since a 61 percent 
increase in the last quarter of 1986 as hourly wages and benefits 
rose at an annual rate of 41 percent 
after taking into account a 44 percent annual rate of inflation 
in the last 18 months workers purchasing power actually declined 
06 percent from april through june the department said 
its certainly not a sign that wages are accelerating or 
causing inflation said michael evans who runs a washington 
economic consulting firm 
evans and other private analysts said the quarterly figures are 
subject to revision and often fluctuate widely 
if you take the first two quarters together you have 
productivity improving at a rate of about 15 percent the first six 
months just like it has for several years now evans said if 
labor costs are rising 25 percent to 3 percent and wages are going 
up about 4 percent there is nothing inflationary in it 
while businesses generally suffered from poorer efficiency in 
the second quarter manufacturers continued to show improved 
productivity up 35 percent from the first quarter 
reflecting a boom in the industrial sector spawned by 
recordbreaking exports factory production soared 54 percent in 
the second quarter with only a 18 percent increase in the number 
of hours worked 
manufacturers also were much more successful in holding down 
factory wage and benefit increases allowing annual raises of only 
29 percent from april through june 
that enabled employers to reduce the labor costs of each item 
coming off their assembly lines by 06 percent even though it 
meant their workers took a 18 percent cut in purchasing power the 
government said

insilco corp said thursday its board 
approved a managementled buyout offer that values the 
hightechnology and specialty consumer products company at 950 
million 
the boards action in backing the 29ashare offer came two 
days after the company disclosed that its management was 
considering making an offer to acquire the company in a leveraged 
buyout 
in a leveraged buyout investors typically borrow heavily to buy 
out a company and then pay off the debt with the target companys 
cash flow or the sale of its assets 
insilco officials would not say whether there had been any 
outside offers for the company 
its certainly in the ballpark of whats reasonable said 
arthur m stupay an analyst with prescott ball and turben of 
cleveland its a good offer 
stupay said he doubted a better offer would be forthcoming 
i dont think too many people can understand this company 
he said 
but in trading on the new york stock exchange insilco rose 2 a 
share to 2925 or 25 cents above the offered price 
in recent years insilco once known as the international silver 
co has restructured itself into an industrial holding company 
with operating companies that make products for hightechnology 
industries and speciality consumer markets 
insilco makes red devil paints rolodex rotary files metal 
cartridges and other projectiles for the defense industry and 
duallite emergency lighting equipment 
stupay said management probably made the offer because it was 
frustrated that good earnings did not lead to higher stock 
prices they said if stockholders would not pay higher values we 
would 
under the buyout agreement the managementled group isc 
holdings inc will pay 29 for each of the companys 256 million 
shares isc holdings which also includes certain affiliates of 
first boston inc will assume insilcos debt giving the deal a 
total indicated value of 950 million 
a cash tender offer will begin within five business days the 
company said 
on wednesday insilco soared 6 a share in heavy trading 
following an announcement that management might attempt a leveraged 
buyout 
in making the announcement on tuesday insilco said there were 
no assurances an offer would be made or completed 
the management group has obtained commitments totaling 960 
million to finance the purchase including 430 million from 
affiliates of first boston 
in the second quarter insilco earned 117 million or 55 cents 
per share compared with 11 million or 52 cents a share in the 
same period a year earlier revenue rose to 1964 million from 
1543 million

the two broadest measures of the nations money 
supply rose in the week ended july 25 the federal reserve board 
reported thursday 
the fed said the measure known as m2 rose to a seasonally 
adjusted 30246 billion in the week ended july 25 from a revised 
30234 billion the previous week 
an even broader measure m3 increased to a seasonally adjusted 
38224 billion from 38196 billion 
the narrowest measure of the money supply m1 rose to a 
seasonally adjusted 7818 billion from a revised 7813 billion 
m1 includes cash in circulation deposits in checking accounts 
and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
the fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for 
annual growth in m2 and m3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent 
which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 55 percent to 85 
percent the fed has not set a specific target range for m1 since 
early 1987

bond prices were higher in fairly light trading 
thursday as investors awaited the latest government report on 
unemployment 
the treasurys bellwether 30year issue which in the previous 
session fell about point or 250 per 1000 face amount closed 
up 375 
its yield which moves inversely to its price fell to 903 
percent from 908 percent late wednesday 
elizabeth g reiners an economist at dean witter reynolds inc 
attributed the price rebound to speculation that the july 
unemployment data scheduled to be released friday would show a 
weakening in the labor force 
softness in the economy is usually considered bullish for the 
credit markets because it lessens the prospects for higher 
inflation which erodes the value of fixedincome securities and 
causes interest rates to rise 
a stable dollar in foreignexchange trading also lent a positive 
tone to bond prices traders said 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm

corn and soybean futures prices rose sharply thursday on the 
chicago board of trade on prospects for continued hot dry weather 
in the droughtstricken farm belt 
wheat and oat futures also advanced but not as strongly as corn 
and soybeans which soared their permitted daily limits late in the 
session before profittaking trimmed the gains analysts said 
on other markets cattle futures were up sharply while pork 
futures were mixed orange juice futures surged coffee sank 
precious metals and energy were mixed and stockindex futures 
retreated 
the grain markets opened higher in response to the national 
weather services 6to10day forecast for abovenormal 
temperatures and belownormal rainfall next week in the midwest 
where stunted soybean plants are struggling to produce and fill 
bean pods 
the rally was held in check though by morning forecasts for 
scattered showers late thursday and friday 
but at midday some private meteorologists reduced the amount of 
rain in their shortterm forecasts triggering a buying explosion 
in the corn and soybean pits 
everything took off with a big bang said jerry gidel an 
analyst with the gh miller division of lit america inc 
the main influence was those weather forecasts for the next 
few days said victor lespinasse a trader for dean witter 
reynolds inc 
lespinasse said the trading floor was abuzz with talk of reduced 
harvest prospects for soybeans and gidel said field observers were 
reporting further deterioration in the hardhit corn crop after 
five straight days of hot dry weather

the october livecattle contract up the 150centsapound daily 
limit in reaction to strong cash prices for fed cattle analysts 
said 
the packers would certainly like to be able to buy cattle 
cheaper but the feedyards are really digging in their heels and 
not wanting to sell cattle at lower prices said charlie 
richardson an analyst in denver with lindwaldock amp co 
further support stemmed from expectations that the usdas 
monthly cattleonfeed report will show heavy marketing activity 
and a slowdown in feedlot placements last month richardson said 
that report will be released aug 15 
hog futures were narrowly mixed while frozen pork bellies swung 
lower

cents a pound 
frozen concentrated orange juice for september delivery soared 6 
cents a pound on the new york cotton exchange in a technical rally 
sparked by the contracts opening at 1905 threetenths of a cent 
above the previous contract high of 1902 analysts said 
tight supplies of brazilian orange juice continue to provide 
fundamental support to the market said judith ganes an analyst in 
new york with merrill lynch capital markets

a house panel approved legislation thursday 
increasing the penalties for insider trading holding securities 
firms liable in some cases for their employees violations and 
offering a bounty to whistleblowers 
this bill represents a powerful congressional assault on 
insider trading a pernicious practice which has undermined the 
public trust in the fundamental fairness and integrity of our 
securities markets said rep edward j markey dmass the 
sponsor of the bill and chairman of the finance subcommittee of the 
house energy and commerce committee 
securities firms had been fighting the measure but dropped their 
objections after markey agreed in talks late tuesday to soften some 
of the bills provisions 
the securities industry association at a hearing last month 
objected to making companies liable when their employees use 
nonpublic information to profit by trading securities 
the bill as passed requires companies to have systems designed 
to detect insider trading but it limits their liability to 
violations in which they either knew or recklessly disregarded 
the facts 
brokerage firms were also worried about the bounty provisions 
arguing that they would give inhouse compliance officers an 
incentive to withhold knowledge of wrongdoing from the firm in 
hopes of collecting a bounty later 
however according to a securities industry association official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity markey has agreed to limit the 
situations in which a brokerage firm employee could collect the 
bounty which would be capped at 10 percent of any penalty levied 
rep matthew j rinaldo of new jersey the ranking republican on 
the committee said the compromise provides a substantial 
deterrent on insider trading without placing an undue burden on 
the securities industry 
in other provisions the legislation would 
increase the maximum criminal insider trading fine from the 
current 100000 for individuals and 500000 for corporations and 
partnerships to 1 million for individuals and 25 million for 
firms 
boost the maximum jail term from five years to 10 years 
create a legal basis for private investors to sue to recover 
money lost because of inside trading 
give the securities and exchange commission power to issue 
subpoenas and take sworn statements on behalf of foreign agencies 
pursuing securities violations the sec intends to ask foreign 
countries to return the service 
the bill adopted by the finance subcommittee on a voice vote 
avoids a controversial question that has held up insider trading 
legislation for more than a year how broadly or narrowly to define 
insider trading 
the offense is currently defined by court and regulatory 
interpretation securities firms had been seeking a better guide 
for determining if a particular activity were illegal others 
argued that a definition would simply provide a roadmap for 
evasion 
the senate banking committee last week passed a much narrower 
insider trading bill including only the provisions on 
international cooperation 
markey said he hoped the full energy and commerce committee 
could act as soon as next week if the bill passes the full house 
he said he would seek to include its provisions when the house and 
senate versions are reconciled 
an aide to sen william proxmire dwis chairman of the senate 
banking committee said the senator is inclined to favor markeys 
broader legislation

a top us treasury official warned western 
europeans thursday that increased protection of european business 
against us competition would bring counteraction from the us 
government 
the intensification of protectionism in europe would certainly 
evoke a response from the us government m peter mcpherson 
deputy secretary of the treasury told the institute for 
international economics 
mcpherson will take the place temporarily of secretary james a 
baker iii if baker as expected resigns to run the presidential 
campaign of vice president george bush 
mcpherson has appeared little in public since he took his job a 
year ago he was previously administrator of the us agency for 
international development his speech thursday was the first major 
us government statement on plans for the 12 countries of the 
european economic community to put an end to all trade barriers 
among them by 1992 
the countries are west germany france britain italy the 
netherlands belgium denmark spain portugal greece ireland and 
luxembourg 
some europeans feel that the pressure of greater competition 
within europe should be mitigated by limiting competition from the 
rest of the world mcpherson said 
this is the sentiment behind suggestions such as that made by 
one prominent industrialist that a protective curtain be erected 
around the the internal market 
he did not name the industrialist 
mcphersons speech was made the day after congress sent 
president reagan the first big overhaul of us trade policies in 
14 years reagan is expected to approve it 
europeans have criticized the new us trade rules as 
protectionist among the critics is sir roy denman the eec 
ambassador in washington he attended thursdays meeting of the 
institute for international economics a private group that studies 
world issues 
theres a tendency in this country to think of a dear old 
kindly uncle sam being led by guileful europeans into a deep pit 
he told the audience of economists 
he denied that the europeans want to freeze the united states 
out of their markets 
mcpherson said the reagan administration favors equal treatment 
among all trading partners rather than deals between pairs of 
countries which is known as reciprocity 
this standard of reciprocity could be applied in a manner that 
would discriminate against firms in the united states seeking 
entrance into the eec and against usowned firms already 
operating in europe mcpherson said 
he suggested that instead of reciprocity the europeans adopt 
the principle of national treatment giving us firms the 
same legal rights that they give firms from one anothers countries

the treasury department said thursday it is 
working with debttroubled argentina to arrange a shortterm loan 
of up to 500 million from the united states and other creditor 
nations

interest payments on its foreign debt much of it owed to private 
us banks while it negotiates with the international monetary 
fund and the world bank 
but according to a department statement funds from the 
shortterm loan wont become available until argentina meets 
certain requirements under the world banks lending program

million in payments has said it cannot afford to make its overdue 
interest payments 
recently it has taken measures to cut its budget deficit and 
check inflation running about 20 percent a month this week it 
declared a threeday bank holiday and devalued its currency

governments through the bank for international settlements a

a federal grand jury returned the firstever 
racketeering indictment against a group of securities professionals 
thursday charging six people in a multimillion dollar fraud scheme 
involving a new jersey investment partnership and the wall street 
firm drexel burnham lambert inc 
the 35count indictment charging racketeering conspiracy and 
mail and wire fraud named five top partners and employees of 
princetonnewport partners headquartered in princeton nj and 
newport beach calif 
it also named a former trader in the highyield bond department 
of drexel in beverly hills calif 
the case which grew out of the governments widespread 
investigation of wall street insider trading is the first to 
charge brokerage officials under the racketeer influenced and 
corrupt organization act lawyers said 
that act originally intended to fight organized crime and drug 
trafficking carries severe penalties including up to 20 years in 
prison and the confiscation of property and earnings 
all those charged denied any wrongdoing in statements issued 
through their attorneys who characterized the indictment as a 
pressure tactic to get the defendants cooperation in the insider 
trading investigation 
named as defendants were james s regan 46 a managing partner 
of princetonnewport jack z rabinowitz 41 general partner 
charles m zarzecki 40 partner and chief trader paul berkman 
41 partner and trader in princetonnewport arbitrage partners a 
subsidiary of princetonnewport steven b smotrich 33 
comptroller of princetonnewport and bruce l newberg 31 
securities trader in drexels highyield bond department until 
early this year 
each was charged with one count of conspiracy one count of 
racketeering and one count of racketeering conspiracy the five 
princetonnewport defendants also were charged with 32 counts of 
mail and wire fraud newberg additionally was charged with 26 
counts of mail and wire fraud 
the charges arose from an alleged scheme involving the bogus 
sale of securities between princetonnewport and drexel to create 
more than 13 million in phony tax losses and avoid regulatory 
disclosure requirements the indictment also alleges stock 
manipulation from july 1 1984 to the present 
the indictment alleged that to gain drexels assistance in the 
bogus trades princetonnewport parked securities for drexel to 
help drexel hide certain holdings the new jersey firm also aided 
drexel in stock manipulation the indictment charged 
this harmless activity has been twisted into a rico charge 
solely as a device to bludgeon these reputable people into 
testifying against others said paul grand an attorney for 
zarzecki 
were pawns in a much larger game said robert schwartz an 
attorney for rabinowitz when the elephants fight its the ants 
that get slaughtered 
rudolph giuliani us attorney for the southern district of new 
york responded to those allegations in a news conference saying 
the indictment stands on its own 
this is a multimilliondollar crime said giuliani it 
happened not once not twice it was a classic pattern of criminal 
activity 
but giuliani declined to say whether any other drexel officials 
or the firm itself would be indicted 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said obviously todays 
indictment of bruce newberg a former employee of the firm is 
deeply disturbing we have only recently become acquainted with 
some fo the allegations in the case we have been informed by bruce 
newbergs lawyer that he intends to plead not guilty it would be 
unfair for us to prejudge the case or to comment further at this 
time 
the indictment also alleged princetonnewport conducted 
fraudulent trading activity through merrill lynch amp co but 
merrill cooperated fully with the investigation and was not accused 
of any wrongdoing 
the governments investigation of insider trading which snared 
speculator ivan boesky in 1986 has been thought to focus more 
recently on drexel and specifically michael milken the head of the 
firms highyield bond department 
the indictment does not name milken but notes that newberg 
reported directly to the head of the highyield bond department 
defense attorneys alleged the six defendants had been questioned 
earlier in the drexelrelated probe and that the government had 
offered to drop the racketeering charges against them if the six 
cooperated with investigators 
giuliani said he could not comment on that allegation but 
rebuked what he characterized as irresponsible statements by the 
defense lawyers 
this whole silliness is designed to deflect you from what the 
case was all about he told reporters 
if convicted on all counts the defendants face 20 years in 
prison on each of the racketeering counts five years in prison on 
each of the remaining counts and 250000 in fines on each count 
for a total of 1875 million the government said 
also under the racketeering statute the government could seek 
forfeiture of investments and interests of the defendants

venezuelan president jaime lusinchi 
said thursday he was sending a mission to the united states to 
press for new loans to aid the venezuelan economy which is 
laboring under the burden of its 34 billion foreign debt and the 
drop in world oil prices 
lusinchi said the mission headed by finance minister hector 
hurtado was aimed at negotiating the restoration of capital flow 
into venezuela including new loans 
the continuing weakness in the market for oil the nations 
chief export severely has limited venezuelas ability to fight an 
economic crisis that keeps over 40 percent of the labor force 
deprived of full employment 
we understand that the gordian knot tying up the venezuelan 
economy is the foreign debt problem and we have decided to cut 
it lusinchi said in a nationwide television address 
the mission was expected to meet representatives of creditor 
banks early next week in washington and new york and request up to 
3 billion in loans an amount intended to offset the balance of 
payments deficit calculated for this year 
lusinchi spoke in the wake of a record fall by the venezuelan 
currency the bolivar triggered by officially denied reports that 
the nation was ready to declare a unilateral moratorium on payments 
on 203 billion of its foreign debt 
the news was denied emphatically by hurtado who labeled as 
irresponsible the debt moratorium story printed thursday by el 
universal one of the countrys most influential newspapers 
this is a totally groundless information hurtado told a 
news conference i want to reiterate that venezuela as a serious 
nation will continue abiding by its international commitments as 
much as with its plans to look for new loans 
lusinchi said as to this matter debt we have not rushed and 
will not rush to measures which are not well supported but he 
warned that as the oil market goes so will the countrys ability 
to repay its creditors 
venezuela is latin americas fourthlargest debtor after 
brazil mexico and argentina 
venezuelas financial difficulties have worsened in the past few 
months international monetary reserves at the central bank have 
been steadily declining from over 93 billion in december to 85 
billion as of june of this total only 25 billion are liquid 
reserves 
lusinchi said venezuela had agreed on a refinancing scheme with 
creditor banks only on condition that the banks grant new loans to 
venezuela it is widely acknowledged that efforts in that direction 
have been almost fruitless 
servicing its foreign debt will cost venezuela over 5 billion 
this year the amount includes more than 4 billion in interest 
payments or nearly 50 percent of the nations projected total 
export revenue for 1988

farm lawmakers approved a 39 billion aid 
package for droughtstricken farmers thursday night including a 
threemonth dairy pricesupport increase but limiting feed 
assistance to livestock producers 
we have moved in record time and we have developed a good 
fair bill senate agriculture committee chairman patrick j 
leahy dvt said after the housesenate conference committee 
approved the compromise package 
plans call for bringing the bill to the floor in both the house 
and senate by next wednesday at the latest and most lawmakers 
believe that the electionyear package will find overwhelming 
support in both chambers 
president reagan is expected to sign the measure whose 39 
billion cost estimate is well below the 6 billion level at which 
the measure could have nasty budgetary repercussions 
major provisions would provide farmers with 65 percent of crop 
losses beyond 35 percent of the expected harvest that feature 
already was cemented when the conference committee went into 
session 
farmers very severely hurt by the drought would get even more 
the bill would furnish producers with 90 percent of losses over 75 
percent of their expected harvest that represented a compromise 
between the 95 percent level in the house version and the 85 
percent level passed by the senate 
house and senate negotiators were unable to agree on much in 
sessions thursday morning and early afternoon leahy and house 
agriculture committee chairman e kika de la garza dtexas 
finally went behind closed doors joined by senior republicans 
they produced a compromise that was swiftly adopted when the 
conference committee met thursday night 
they dropped a senatepassed provision that would provide 
government feed assistance to farmers who would not ordinarily be 
producing their own feed even if not for the drought agriculture 
secretary richard lyng said wednesday he would have trouble 
recommending the feature to president reagan because the price tag 
was 2 billion 
the compromise version retained a housepassed provision that 
would provide assistance to livestock producers who also produce 
their own feed the price tag would be 800 million by 
administration estimate 
the decision to narrow the feed benefits went a long way toward 
dropping the price tag to 39 billion well below earlier 
estimates of what the final price tag would be 
livestock feed has become a key to the drought issue heat and a 
lack of rain have scorched a substantial quantity of hay and feed 
grains in the midcontinent causing feed prices to shoot up 
the compromise retained the one major dispute that the conferees 
had resolved in their otherwise futile sessions earlier a house 
provision that would raise the dairy pricesupport level in april 
through june next year by 50 cents to 1110 for each 100 pounds of 
milk 
in accepting the house plan to raise the support level leahy 
voted aye while all of the other senate conferees remained 
silent the senate chairmans home state is a major source of the 
east coasts milk supply 
the senate recedes to the house by one weak aye announced 
de la garza as laughter passed over the scores of agribusiness 
lobbyists and congressional staffers in the room 
but the compromise made substantial modifications in a 
senateapproved provision that would constitute a major benefit for 
american manufacturers of ethanol ethyl alcohol made from farm 
products and mixed with gasoline to form the fuel gasohol 
as passed by the senate the measure would have allowed ethanol 
makers to buy 2 million bushels each of surplus corn or other 
crops each month at 110 percent of the govermentowned commodity 
credit corporations acquisition price well below current 
droughtinflated prices the total available would have been 
limited to 16 million bushels a month 
proponents said the plan was designed to boost a number of small 
ethanol manufacturers but it could also have turned into a sizeable 
subsidy for the archer daniels midland co of decatur ill a 
major corporation with a politically active management 
the final product of the conference committee however would 
make the program optional and leave the final sayso up to the 
secretary of agriculture i dont think it will be put into 
effect said rep edward r madigan rill the ranking house 
agriculture committee republican 
the bill also would exclude participation by ethanol producers 
that use more than 30 million bushels of corn a year 
house provisions that would make disaster payments available to 
farmers hit by disasters other than the drought including some 
that happened in 1987 also were adopted by the conference 
committee the payments would be for drought hail excessive 
moisture or related condition 
the related condition includes hurricanes because they come 
with moisture de la garza said that resolved a concern of rep 
jerry huckaby dla who raised the issue several times hail 
payments were designed to compensate cotton growers in the district 
of rep larry combest rtexas for damage in a storm that struck 
last year 
administration officials had been opposed to the provision 
the two houses compromised on a house requirement that farmers 
would have to buy federal crop insurance in 1989 and 1990 to 
receive disaster payments under the legislation they would have 
to buy one year of the insurance if their disaster loss exceeded 65 
percent of normal yield

a temporary court order against eastern 
airlines plans to scrap routes to 14 cities was limited thursday 
to halting 4000 layoffs when the carrier cited logistical 
difficulties with obeying a wider ban 
us district judge barrington d parker ordered eastern to 
suspend plans to lay off 4000 pilots flight attendants and other 
employees as part of the broader plan to curtail service after aug 
31 according to union lawyers who attended a closed session with 
the judge 
parker scheduled an aug 11 hearing on a bid by three employee 
unions for a preliminary injunction to prevent eastern from 
reducing service by 201 flights per day 
he also extended the temporary restraining order which was 
issued wednesday until aug 19 
in miami eastern president phil bakes said in a statement we 
are pleased that the court refused to adopt the plaintiffs 
proposed order which would have been extremely disruptive to the 
flying public and the nations travel agents 
charles e bryan president of eastern machinists district 100 
also in miami said of the order we had no problems we were 
completely satisfied it was upholding our positions 
the reorganization proposed by the financially troubled airline 
also includes plans to close the kansas city hub and to concentrate 
service on the east coast and to latin america 
a copy of parkers written order however was not released by 
his chambers and wont be made public until friday 
he is trying to create a standstill in a way that minimized 
the harm to eastern if they win and minimized the harm to us if 
the unions ultimately prevail said labor attorney robert burka 
during a hearing convened earlier in open court eastern 
attorney michael madigan told parker there were numerous 
operational difficulties to complying with a blanket order to 
halt implementation of the schedule changes 
the scheduling of an airline is an incredibly complex problem 
that must be done in advance madigan said at the hearing 
the temporary restraining order was obtained by the air line 
pilots association the international association of machinists and 
aerospace workers and the transport workers union the unions 
argued the reorganization violates federal labor law 
eastern has already taken steps to implement the new schedule 
which involves allowing pilots to bid on certain flights under 
union work rules madigan said 
there are also problems posed by using airport slots and 
scheduling maintenance crews he said 
madigan said the airline would be in contempt of parkers order 
if it were required to undo the steps it has already taken to 
reorganize its schedule 
but eastern was willing to carry the 4000 employees it wants to 
lay off on its payroll while the issue is argued in court madigan 
said 
parker adjourned the hearing to give attorneys for both sides 
time to fashion the specific terms fothe order 
the judge later joined the parties in a discussion in the jury 
room behind the courtroom in an attempt to work out a settlement 
during the session parker indicated the terms of the order that 
he would issue according to attorneys who attended the session 
before leaving the bench parker sharply questioned madigan 
about why at wednesdays hearing he didnt raise the logistical 
problems he was now citing 
everything went well as far as you were concerned until you 
heard the ruling of the court the judge told madigan 
i frankly was quite surprised by the courts ruling as you 
have known from the look on my face madigan said recalling his 
expression when parker delivered his ruling from the bench on 
wednesday 
frank lorenzo chairman of texas air corp easterns parent 
meanwhile accused the eastern unions of waiting until the eleventh 
hour to challenge a reorganization that it has known about for 
months 
speaking at the dedication of a new terminal at newark 
international airport in new jersey he said this schedule like 
all schedules has been in the design for months 
the unions knew very well this was in the design for months 
and they came in at the very last minute lorenzo said at the 
opening of the terminal that will serve as the east coast hub of 
continental airlines another texas air subsidiary

the japanese are abandoning their successful 
selloverseas saveathome formula and pumping more yen into their 
own markets boosting imports and their taste for upscale consumer 
goods according to a government study released friday 
the economic planning agency broadly summarizing trends in the 
1987 fiscal year that ended in march said booming consumption 
among the oncefrugal japanese had pulled the economy through a 
brief crisis triggered when the soaring yen battered japanese 
exports 
the agencys white paper also said the longterm picture 
indicates the trend should continue 
when we look at the japanese economy now it is very close to 
an ideal state of affairs said shunji fukinbara head of the 
agencys research bureau japanese corporations have shifted the 
emphasis from exportled development to domestic sales 
in line with their catchup efforts with the asian newly 
industrialized economies japanese corporations shed some business 
activities that dont pay and encouraged new businesses and 
products he said 
the corporate selfscrutiny together with cheaper prices of oil 
and imports and lower lending rates helped stabilize the economy 
and ease a jobless rate that peaked at a postwar high of 32 
percent early in 1987 the report said 
japans currency nearly has doubled in value against the us 
dollar since late 1985 when world monetary leaders agreed to 
devalue the dollar to help the competitiveness of american exports 
and trim washingtons massive trade deficit 
japanese economic growth which registered a sluggish 25 
percent in fiscal 1986 was 49 percent last year 
growth in imports outpaced exports with goods from the european 
community and asias economic dynamos south korea taiwan hong 
kong and ingapore outpacing shipments from the united states 
while import volume was up 12 percent in 1987 exports rose by 
only 11 percent fukinbara said manufactured imports scored a 
substantial 456 percent gain partly because japanese exporters 
were moving factories to cheaper sites overseas and shipping the 
goods home 
japanese tastes were tending toward the affluent fukinbara 
noted a rise in purchases of luxury goods from europe and durable 
consumer goods videotape recorders automobiles and television 
sets often with valueadded features such as extrawide screens 
but soaring values of stocks and land particularly in tokyo 
are widening an assets gap among the predominantly middleclass 
japanese the white paper noted that the average office worker no 
longer can hope to buy a house and land in the capital even with 
his lifetime savings 
there may be a growing disparity between the haves and 
havenots in japan fukinbara said 
the report suggested that japan do more to open its markets to 
foreign goods give public and private aid to developing countries 
and use its growing influence to stabilize the global monetary 
system and promote free trade
