george bush crafted a watereddown version of the 
reagan revolution tuesday drawing independents and a sixth of the 
nations democrats to his cause and capitalizing on prosperity as a 
campaign theme exit polls said 
bushs experience weighed in his favor the polls said and his 
candidacy appeared to be boosted by affection for his boss 
president reagan 
but bush was nowhere near recreating the 18point reagan 
landslide of 1984 the polls said a majority of women voted for 
michael dukakis as did just more than half of the democrats who 
voted for reagan last time 
overall though bush was winning about 17 percent of the 
democratic voters down from reagans 24 percent in 1984 but still 
a sizable share abc news polling found dukakis by contrast drew 
8 percent of republicans 
as preelection polls anticipated bush led with several of the 
groups that went with reagan in 1980 and 1984 bush was leading 
among independents by 5444 percent in abcs exit polls and a cbs 
newsnew york times survey said bush narrowly won catholics once a 
strongly democratic group 
bush mirrored reagan down to the gender gap running strongly 
among men but less well among women the polls found abc found bush 
leading with men 5643 percent but dukakis narrowly ahead among 
women 5148 percent 
dukakis won support from some reliably democratic groups nine 
in 10 blacks twothirds of hispanics and nearly six in 10 members 
of union households he also narrowly won 18 to 24yearolds in nbc 
newswall street journal polling a group in which bush had been 
strong 
bush did not appear to be seriously hamstrung by his selection of 
sen dan quayle of indiana as his running mate while 16 percent in 
the nbcwall street journal poll said they may have voted for bush 
if he had not picked quayle almost all of them were democrats 
nbc news pollster sheldon gawiser said his conclusion was that 
quayle had little effect on the voting did it make a point 
difference yeah maybe 
economic wellbeing was a key factor in nbcwall street journal 
polling voters split evenly over whether they benefited from 
reagans economic policies the past eight years of those doing 
better 84 percent backed bush of those doing worse 80 percent 
backed dukakis 
but bush held a solid edge 5446 percent among the 12 percent 
of voters who were not sure whether reagans policies had helped 
them 
this is very much an economic election people are in fact 
voting their pocketbooks said gawiser people who have 
benefited are much more likely to vote for bush 
abc news polls found a similar result among those who said they 
were better off than eight years ago bush won 7821 those who 
were worse off went for dukakis 8712 
more than half of the voters polled approved of reagans 
performance as president 53 percent in the nbcwall street journal 
poll and 86 percent of them backed bush the 38 percent who 
disapproved of reagans work went for dukakis in similar numbers 
the 9 percent who were unsure supported dukakis 
even with reagans approval rating voters by 5044 percent said 
in the nbcwall street journal poll they wanted the country to 
change rather than continue its course while 82 percent who favored 
change supported dukakis bush got the rest of them as well as 91 
percent of those who opposed change 
those who counted experience as the most important factor in 
their choice backed bush by an overwhelming 946 percent in abc news 
polling he also was highly rated for being trustworthy in a crisis 
and as a strong leader 
the nbcwall street journal poll similarly found the greatest 
share of bushs backers 29 percent saying they based their 
choice on the candidates competence and experience another 24 
percent cited national security and defense policies 17 percent 
named economic policies 
forty percent of dukakis supporters meanwhile said they based 
their choice on domestic issues such as education and health an 
additional 15 percent cited economic policies in abcs poll 
dukakis was the choice of voters looking for someone who cared about 
people and offered a vision for the future he also won for good 
judgment by 5643 percent 
there was some negative voting as well thirteen percent of the 
voters who backed bush and 19 percent of those who favored dukakis 
said they made their choice primarily out of dislike for the other 
candidate 
asked to single out one issue where they most liked their 
candidates stand 17 percent of the voters in abcs polls said the 
economy and they picked bush 5743 sixteen percent said national 
defense and they were for bush 8811 eleven percent said taxes 
and they were for bush 7326 
eleven percent were most taken with their candidates stand on 
the problems of the poor and they were in the dukakis camp 918 
the democrat also was favored 8218 by the 10 percent most 
impressed with health care stands 
the abc results were based on an initial 7000 interviews with 
voters across the country of more than 10000 planned the margin 
of error was plus or minus three percentage points the cbstimes 
results were based on more than 11000 interviews that poll had a 
twopoint margin of error 
the nbcwall street journal results were based on about 11000 
interviews and had a margin of error of plus or minus three 
percentage points

george bush is likely to begin his presidency with 
a blaze of summitry on everything from the nations staggering 
budget deficit to natos foreign policy priorities and arms 
reductions with moscow 
bush whose political inclinations have bobbed across the 
spectrum promises to bring to the white house a less ideological 
brand of leadership than president reagan 
he likely will be more of a handson manager than reagan more 
involved in the daytoday operation of government but not as deeply 
absorbed in the mechanics as jimmy carter was 
at the same time bush is known as a delegator of authority a 
student of the problems of governance who believes that the best way 
to chart goals and get things done is to put the right people in the 
right places 
i suspect that george bush will want a staff that includes sort 
of credentialed experts as opposed to ideological soul mates around 
him said david keene a republican political consultant who once 
worked for bush 
james a baker iii the former treasury secretary who was bushs 
campaign chairman is expected to wind up as secretary of state 
former sen john tower of texas has been lobbying hard to be 
secretary of defense 
bush is expected to keep nicholas brady as treasury secretary 
dick thornburgh as attorney general lauro cavazos as education 
secretary and ann mclaughlin as labor secretary or in another 
cabinet post 
however bushs surprise selection of dan quayle as his running 
mate demonstrates that he might not follow the conventional wisdom 
in staffing his administration 
after a news conference here on wednesday bush will return to 
washington for a victory rally and then drop out of sight thursday 
for a fourday florida vacation 
he will return to washington on monday for a meeting at midweek 
with british prime minister margaret thatcher last june reagan had 
invited mrs thatcher to the white house for a farewell meeting with 
himself and a gettogether with the new presidentelect regardless 
of who won 
bush also will meet next week with west german chancellor helmut 
kohl 
mrs thatcher would like to see a nato foreign ministers meeting 
that is scheduled to be held in june in london upgraded to a full 
nato summit conference to develop strategy for dealing with the 
kremlin 
bush already has proposed a nato summit meeting so its likely 
theyll be talking on the same wave length 
a nato meeting could pave the way for bush to meet with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev bush said recently he would like to 
meet the soviet leader at the earliest time so they can size 
each other up and determine how to move ahead with strategic and 
conventional arms talks 
among the first major problems facing bush are the budget deficit 
and the national debt interest payments alone on the debt will hit 
160 billion in the fiscal year 1989 
to stem the red ink bush has promised to personally lead 
negotiations with congress on deficitreduction 
that likely will provide some fireworks since the democrats in 
congress are unlikely to give bush the same silkglove treatment 
that reagan received eight years ago when the gop captured the 
senate 
after the election you have to sit down and make peace with 
the congress said thomas griscom former white house chief of 
communications under reagan 
there also have been suggestions that bush should meet with 
defeated candidate michael dukakis to try to repair the wounds of a 
nasty campaign 
along with the other summits bush has proposed a global 
conference on the environment and a hemispheric meeting on the drug 
problems moreover he says he will meet with all the nations 
governors to talk about educational standards he has not indicated 
that he has any bold initiatives or solutions for any of the 
problems

lloyd bentsen declared victory tuesday night 
for reelection to the senate and on his unsuccessful campaign for 
the white house praised michael dukakis for running a campaign 
based on faith in the truth 
he and i waged a campaign thats worthy of the american 
people the democratic vice presidential candidate said of the 
massachusetts governor 
we told you the truth and we stepped up to those issues he 
said his voice cracking from fatigue as he addressed supporters in 
austins driskill hotel we challenged america to do better 
we fought fair and we never quit and we never lost our faith 
in the truth thats what you need in a campaign 
bentsen said he had never seen a candidate work any harder or 
deliver a message any stronger than dukakis did as the campaign drew 
to a close 
and he made me proud to be his partner bentsen said he 
made me proud to be his running mate and he made me proud to be an 
american 
bentsen did not directly concede defeat in the national campaign 
for which he was unable to deliver texas to the democratic column 
he left that task to dukakis 
he claimed victory in his senate race which he won handily over 
rep beau boulter rtexas 
jack devore bentsens longtime senate spokesman said the 
election results were bittersweet 
on the one hand theres gratitude to the people of texas he 
said on the other hand theres not 
bentsen in network interviews early in the evening said dukakis 
had been badly hurt by the republicans negative advertising 
bentsen said he had been left pretty much unscathed by the 
negative advertising aimed at the top of the democratic ticket 
they did a job on michael dukakis with the negative ads 
bentsen said in an interview on abctv and they distorted his 
record did so to a remarkable degree and that was difficult to 
overcome 
i wasnt worked over like that they didnt do that type of 
thing to me character assassination overall ive been pretty 
much unscathed 
bentsen like lyndon johnson 28 years before him waited in the 
capital of texas for the election returns on whether he and the 
governor of massachusetts would make it to the white house 
bentsen spent most of election day in his hotel suite visiting 
with family and campaign workers and making telephone calls to his 
state organization 
at a brief photo session in the afternoon he appeared upbeat 
encouraged he said by a large voter turnout in texas 
he was asked by reporters to compare this years campaign with 
the 1960 race 
i think the mood is there coming from behind but were coming 
more from behind than they did then and they just barely won he 
said i think our campaign caught on pretty late and the question 
was always did we have enough time 
bentsen said he had spoken with dukakis on the telephone asked 
the substance of the conversation he quipped well it wasnt 
about cabinet appointments 
the 67yearold texas senator was nursing a head cold and he 
canceled plans to visit a campaign phone bank during the day he had 
voted earlier by absentee ballot 
like lbj bentsen was also on the ballot for reelection to his 
senate seat under texas law he could run for both offices but he 
promised to resign from the senate if he won the vice presidency 
as johnson did after john f kennedy won the presidential race in 
1960 
polls released just prior to election day indicated the democrats 
trailed republicans george bush and dan quayle in texas dukakis 
picked bentsen in hopes the texan could help deliver the states 29 
electoral votes 
bentsen seemed secure in seeking a fourth term in the senate 
however as almost every poll showed him up by 20 or more points 
over boulter 
bentsen finished his vice presidential campaign when he arrived 
back in texas after 2 am tuesday from a marathon day in which he 
visited eight cities five in texas and one each in arkansas 
louisiana and missouri 
bentsen who was chosen by dukakis on july 12 and nominated by 
the democratic convention the following week campaigned in 33 
states and washington dc with about a third of his campaign time 
spent in texas he traveled more than 107000 miles said mike 
mccurry his spokesman

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in a move 
that surprised many people in iran and neighboring countries has 
declared that free social expression is the best way to settle 
disputes 
irans official islamic republic news agency reported monday that 
khomeini said academic argument should be encouraged rather 
than suppressed in the interest of dogmatic interpretation and 
authoritarian outlooks 
but it said that in an open letter published in the jomhuri 
islami newspaper irans revolutionary patriarch also advised 
advocates of differing opinions not to go to extremes or try to 
defame the other side 
jomhuri islami is usually the mouthpiece for hardline islamic 
revolutionary factions 
the agency monitored in cyprus said khomeinis letter was a 
reply to a prominent moslem cleric hojatoleslam ansari who asked 
for his conclusive judgment on the divergent ideological 
orientations among irans leaders 
that referred to the differences between pragmatic leaders such 
as parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani and hardliners led by prime 
minister hussein musavi and interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
the differences have centered mainly on economic matters but 
intensified after the khomeinidominated government accepted a 
unsponsored ceasefire in july in its 8yearold war with iraq 
khomeini generally had sided with the hardline elements that 
support a centralized economy an isolationist foreign policy and 
absolute adherence to the koran the islamic holy book they also 
opposed the ceasefire which took effect aug 20 
but irans economy has been devastated by the war and its 
isolation from the west and rafsanjanis group appears to have 
gained strength 
mousavi attempted to resign in july citing differences within 
the regime but khomeini publicly rebuked him telling him to stop 
complaining and stay at his post 
rafsanjani has encourged more links with the west and in 
september iran began negotiations aimed at restoring full diplomatic 
ties with britain 
hardliners objected to the move and irans decision to continue 
the talks was considered a victory for rafsanjanis faction 
iran has been under tight control and a strict islamic code since 
the revolution organized by khomeini ousted the shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi in 1979 
a major issue now is if the government should maintain its firm 
grip on the economy and foreign trade or adopt more open policies 
toward trade with the west and western participation in postwar 
reconstruction 
sources inside iran have reported a relaxation of the strict 
social code based on islamic tenets under those religious 
principles women who do not wear headtofoot robes can be jailed 
or fined and moslems convicted of drinking liquor can be publicly 
flogged 
the sources said those rules remain in effect but are not being 
as rigidly enforced as they were up to a few months ago

democrats appear assured of keeping or 
improving their 5446 grip on the senate in todays balloting as a 
handfull of cliffhanger contests inject political drama into an 
election in which most incumbents probably are home free 
if republicans fail to recapture the senate majority they lost 
two years ago as most polls suggest a united democratic front 
will be in place on capitol hill next year to either challenge 
george bush or cheer on michael dukakis 
but officials of both parties report unusual voter volatility in 
this years 33 senate races a factor that could lead to some 
surprises 
democrats appeared poised to capture republicanheld seats in 
nebraska and virginia 
sen david karnes rneb who was appointed to the job trailed 
robert kerrey a popular former democratic governor in late 
polling former virginia gov charles robb soninlaw of the late 
president lyndon b johnson was the oddson favorite for the seat 
of republican sen paul trible who is retiring 
the brightest republican hope for capturing a democratic seat 
appeared to be in mississippi rep trent lott the assistant gop 
leader in the house appeared to have succeeded in his bid to 
replace sen john stennis the senates most senior democrat who is 
retiring 
the open republican seat in vermont appeared in no danger rep 
james jeffords was the clear favorite to succeed gop sen robert 
stafford who is retiring 
but three other open senate seats were the scenes of some of the 
hottest contests 
they included 
florida where reps connie mack iii the republican grandson of 
the baseball hall of fame manager of the same name battled rep 
buddy mackay for the seat of retiring sen lawton chiles dfla 
washington where former republican sen slade gorton staged a 
comeback try against rep mike lowry a liberal democrat 
wisconsin where millionare businessman and political newcomer 
herb kohl held an edge in polls over state senate minority leader 
susan engeleiter one of the few women among 1988 senate candidates 
the race was marked by kohl outspending engeleiter with millions of 
dollars of his own money 
two republican incumbents were battling strong attempts to oust 
them from their seats 
sen chic hecht in nevada a first termer has been struggling 
all year against popular democratic gov richard bryan and 
threeterm maverick lowell weicker in connecticut who first came to 
national attention as a member of the senate watergate committee 
was strongly challenged by democratic state attorney general joseph 
lieberman 
one democratic incumbent frank lautenberg of new jersey 
struggled to fight off republican pete dawkins a resume candidate 
who has been a rhodes scholar football star and onestar army 
general 
sen pete wilson rcalif appeared likely to survive a strong 
challenge by democratic lt gov leo mccarthy wilson led mccarthy 
by comfortable margins in every poll over the past 21 months 
topping mccarthy by 14 points in a final preelection survey 
democrats with the safest seats appeared to include sen robert 
c byrd dwva who is moving from senate majority leader to 
become chairman of the appropriations committee sen edward m 
kennedy dmass and sen george mitchell dmaine one of a trio 
of senators seeking to succeed byrd as democratic leader 
republicans with no apparent reelection problems include sens 
richard lugar of indiana orrin hatch of utah john heinz of 
pennsylvania and john danforth of missouri 
the election results will not mean the end of changes in the 
senate lineup 
both texas democrat lloyd bentsen and indiana republican dan 
quayle are their parties vice presidential nominees the winner be 
it bentsen or quayle will have to be replaced and the governors 
ready to do the appointing are both republicans 
the 1988 senate races had cost more than 157 million by oct 19 
about 43 million of the total came from political action committees 
and other specialinterest groups 
the most money spent was in california more than 13 million by 
wilson about 8 million by mccarthy 
many negative senate campaigns matched or exceeded the 
namecalling in the presidential race 
and many republican candidates sought to link their names to that 
of george bush and to tie their opponents to democrat michael 
dukakis especially in states where bush was expected to do well

it started on st patricks day in 1985 
ronald reagan had been inaugurated two months earlier and richard 
gephardt was at the iowa city vfw hall opening the race to replace 
him 
the precise dates vary but its as good a point as any to mark 
the beginning of the presidential campaign that ends finally 
today it was mindnumbing in length rich in color and left 
political activists yearning for a little peace and quiet 
its hard to believe this is going to be over but its time 
for it to be over said iowa republican chairman michael mahaffey 
therell be a little letdown 
the race between democratic nominee michael dukakis and 
republican nominee george bush was just the final matchup of the 
campaign for iowans who look back at nearly four years of rallies 
coffee klatches and barnyard tours 
they watched jesse jackson milk a cow robert dole drive a 
tractor and bruce babbitt pedal a bike in summer and the dead of 
winter 
iowa was the first testing ground for gephardts toughtalking 
trade policies pat robertsons invisible army of christian 
followers doles im one of you theme and paul simons return 
to liberalism of earlier years 
in the early rounds of the caucuses on feb 8 bush suffered a 
stunning loss finishing third behind dole and robertson dukakis 
also finished third behind gephardt and simon in a closer democratic 
contest 
if todays decision brings a respite the popular consensus is 
that the peace and quiet could last all of 48 hours before yet 
another campaign begins 
they wont have time to rest because they get about a month off 
and were right back at it said state democratic party chairwoman 
bonnie campbell 
im not sure it ever comes to an end in iowa we have this kind 
of perpetual campaign here said phil roeder who was spokesman 
for the state democratic party until this spring 
well have period of 24 or 48 hours for either celebration or 
mourning depending on what happens its the end of the end and 
then its going to be the beginning of the beginning he said

they make only little sips compared to 
californias barrels but vintners in the nations 42 other 
wineproducing states are thinking of organizing 
they say they need a lobbyist soybeans beef pork and even 
catfish enjoy special benefits from the us department of 
agriculture they say so wine should too 
while the market for premium wines is exploding vinters outside 
california have been without washington representation to fight for 
favorable tax trade pesticide and labeling laws says richard j 
feeney who used to lobby for the meat industry and is now 
organizing a trade association for winemakers 
until now he says in a letter to prospective members of the 
national vintners association wine has not been looked upon as 
agricultural and has not been able to share these benefits the time 
has come for wine to take its place with other agricultural 
commodities 
john fitzgerald director of the texas wine marketing institute 
says he sees a need for noncalifornia winemakers to form a united 
front in washington since california is not going to do it 
why should it fitzgerald says when it controls 90 percent of 
the sales 90 percent of the attention 90 percent of the funding 
and 90 percent of the lobbying 
california has its own trade group the wine institute the catch 
for wineries in 42 other states is that only california operators 
can belong feeney said according to feeney no wine is produced in 
six states alaska nevada north dakota south dakota nebraska 
and delaware in kansas no wine is made yet but a permit has been 
issued 
while california produces a significant portion of bulk wine 
other states such as texas and virginia are in a position to 
capitalize on the growing market for premium wines fitzgerald and 
feeney said 
premium wine sales rose 21 percent last year accounting for 20 
percent of sales and 40 percent of revenues fitzgerald said 
in texas alone the 25 commercial wineries bottled 500000 
gallons in 1988 with retail sales of 20 million says andy welch 
spokesman for the texas department of agriculture the lone star 
state accounts for 1 or 2 percent of the total market 
while the marketing future for premium wines is good feeney says 
the legislative and regulatory climate toward alcoholic beverages 
poses a multitude of threats he believes winemakers can best 
head them off by aligning with the agricultural sector and away from 
spirits 
if legislators and regulators are fully and persuasively 
informed about the special requirements for grape growers and wine 
makers and that table wine is in reality a food beverage treatment 
will be more to the industrys benefit feeney wrote 
wine is a beverage of moderation it is a food complement 
says ed auler coowner of fall creek vineyards in tow texas 
europeans have known it for centuries and americans are in the 
process of discovering it at a time neoprohibitionists are coming

americas rural areas are suffering from a 
serious case of neglect says a group of farmstate lawmakers 
already campaigning to provide the countryside with a federally 
financed facelift 
rural americans are worried that the state of the economy in 
their communities will force them to abandon their chosen way of 
life sen thad cochran rmiss said at a recent news conference 
the longrunning debate over rural development seems certain to 
come in for renewed debate on capitol hill next year no matter 
which of the contenders captures the white house 
broader than a mere farm issue rural development focuses on vast 
stretches of land and takes in problems ranging from backed up sewer 
systems in country towns to persuading companies to move to places 
best known for cows and plows 
lawmakers calling for steppedup rural development point to 
higher poverty rates among the 54 million americans who live outside 
urban centers and note that farmers represent only a fraction of 
that number 
rural americas poverty rate currently is running at 18 percent 
well above the urban level and the unemployment rate remains 26 
percent higher in the countryside than in the cities according to 
statistics compiled by the national governors association 
rural areas will be gaining jobs for the rest of this century at 
only 73 percent of the urban rate according to the groups 
projections 
demands for congressional action started in the mid1980s as a 
reaction to smalltown distress that stemmed in part from crop 
surpluses that hurt farm incomes 
senate agriculture committee chairman patrick j leahy dvt 
convened two sessions of the panel this fall with the aim of 
producing a rural development bill but the effort fizzled amid 
questions about the price tag 
leahy however has been calling for resumed action next year 
money remains an obstacle it is in short supply as congress 
wrestles with towering budget deficits indeed levels of many rural 
programs have come down during the reagan years 
the agriculture department for example provided rural areas 
with 290 million in water and waste disposal grants in 1980 that 
climbed dropped to 125 million in 1982 seesawed in the mid1980s 
and has held steady over the last three years at 1094 million 
but money is not the only obstacle priorities are important too 
since the mid1980s rural development has proven itself 
attractive enough politically to get talked about but issues with 
more powerful voter appeal always seem to get the lions share of 
the attention only a few lawmakers from the most rural states are 
persistent advocates 
rural and small town americans are asking the federal 
government to help them make rural life economically viable we 
cannot ignore their dilemma said sen tom daschle dsd one of 
the few lawmakers who consistently ride herd on the issue 
while incapable thus far of galvanizing intense support the 
concept has drawn backing from surprising quarters 
economist fred sanderson of the washingtonbased think tank 
resources for the future for one is often an outspoken critic of 
large farm subsidies but he takes a tolerant view of increased 
federal spending on rural development 
were rather favorably disposed to the idea as something 
essentially for adjustment giving employment to parttime farmers 
or even as a way to move them out of farming altogether where they 
cant make a living on the land says sanderson 
but he warns that it would be expensive even so much as 100 
million he says would merely be a drop in the bucket 
another unresolved matter just what is rural development anyway 
some of the dozens of rural development bills that have tumbled 
into the hopper in recent years concentrate on infrastructure 
replacing wornout bridges repaving potholepocked roads and 
putting in new storm sewers 
increasingly though a more sophisticated focus has crept into 
the issue with new stress on matters such as education and 
communications 
leahys bill this fall sought to speed development of 
telecommunications systems for rural areas as a way of ending their 
traditional isolation and making it easier for companies to locate 
there 
thus far urban critics of farm spending have not been critical 
of such bills primarily because they have yet to reach the floor in 
any comprehensive form recent gains have all been piecemeal 
if such a measure does come in for a major floor debate though 
the critics are likely to point out that indoor plumbing and rural 
electrification were luxuries for many rural residents only a few 
decades ago suggesting that perhaps the countryside is not really 
all that bad off

proposals for more federal aid for americas 
homeless are likely to fare poorly next year no matter who wins 
todays presidential election says a leading activist for the 
homeless 
its going to be a long fight said mitch snyder head of the 
center for creative nonviolence americas politicians havent 
shown much concern about the homeless 
but snyder was more critical of vice president george bush the 
republican candidate than democratic candidate michael dukakis 
weve already seen what bush can do during the eight years of 
the reagan administration snyder said i think things will be 
easier under dukakis 
snyders comments monday came as 377 people were arrested at the 
capitol capping a long series of protests organized by snyder 
the protests began sept 26 and 239 people had been arrested 
before mondays big demonstration most of them had been charged 
with unlawful entry 
about 2000 people took part in a march and a 90minute rally 
that preceded mondays arrests according to dan nichols a 
spokesman for the capitol police 
after the rally in a park across the street from the capitol 
hundreds of people followed snyders appeal to sit down in the 
middle of constitution avenue snyder told the crowd those arrested 
would be fined 25 
the protest and arrests had been coordinated beforehand with 
capitol police said nichols and snyder the 377 people arrested 
were charged with disorderly conduct nichols said 
their hands tied behind them with plastic handcuffs the 
protesters were quietly taken to waiting buses and driven off to be 
booked the arrests were generally quiet 
one of those arrested with benjamin spock the famous 
pediatrician and social activist minutes before his arrest spock 
told the rally that the reagan administration is not treating the 
children and homeless right 
another speaker was cher the academy awardwinning actress who 
had taken part in the march from a motel five miles away she left 
the march to promote her new line of perfume uninhibited but 
returned to the rally in a black van limousine she left shortly 
before the arrests began 
she explained im sorry im late but i had to go do my job 
im here to show my concern and my support for the homeless im 
very committed to the cause of the homeless people have to have it 
brought into their consciousness that the plight of the homeless is 
very serious 
the rally had some of the trappings of a political gathering 
with dozens of people in the crowd sporting dukakisbentsen 
buttons and signs in support of the democratic presidential ticket 
no signs of support for bush were apparent

the supreme courts ruling that huntington 
ny illegally practiced racial segregation in housing could spur 
new challenges to allegedly discriminatory local zoning laws 
in a 63 decision monday the justices upheld a ruling that 
huntington officials reinforced racial segregation by confining 
housing for lowincome families to a predominantly nonwhite urban 
renewal area 
however the court stopped short of deciding the key issue in the 
case whether zoning regulations violate the federal civil rights 
act of 1968 when the local laws have racially discriminatory effects 
but there is no proof they are intentionally biased 
instead the justices in a fourpage unsigned opinion accepted 
the result of a ruling by the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
without endorsing the appeals courts reasoning 
although it is not definitive the high court ruling could give 
civil rights groups new ammunition to challenge community zoning 
ordinances that limit lowcost housing 
huntington officials conceded that the towns zoning policies had 
a disparate impact on minorities regardless of their intent the 
justices said 
we are satisfied on this record that disparate impact was 
shown and that the sole justification proffered to throw out the 
case was inadequate the high court said we do not reach the 
question whether the disparate impact test is the appropriate 
one 
justices byron r white thurgood marshall and john paul stevens 
dissented they voted to hear arguments in the case to explore the 
issue 
the 2nd circuit court said statistics showing a zoning 
ordinances discriminatory effects even if unintentional could 
establish a violation of the 1968 law 
the alternative approach supported by the reagan administration 
among others would require the more difficult task of proving the 
zoning ordinance is intentionally biased 
administration lawyers supported the appeal by huntington 
officials 
congress intended to require a showing of intentional 
discrimination when it passed the fair housing law justice 
department lawyers said 
the 2nd circuit court ruled last april that huntingtons zoning 
ordinance perpetuated segregation by confining to a predominantly 
black area subsidized apartments designed to benefit poorer families 
the disproportionate harm to blacks and the segregative impact 
on the entire community resulting from the refusal to rezone create 
a strong showing of discriminatory effect the appeals court 
said 
the town failed to present bona fide and legitimate 
justifications for its action or show there were no less 
discriminatory alternatives available the appeals court added 
huntington a long island community of some 200000 residents 
has a black population of less than 35 percent most blacks live in 
two neighborhoods 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
along with a local group called housing help inc sued the town in 
1981 for its refusal to approve multifamily dwellings on a 
148acre site in greenlawn a predominantly white hamlet of 
singlefamily houses 
housing help inc proposed to build 162 federally subsidized 
lowincome apartments there 
huntington officials noted that the town has 775 lowincome 
housing units and said it has done its fair share in developing 
subsidized dwellings 
but the 2nd circuit court said confining such apartments to the 
urban renewal area has a disproportionate impact on blacks 
while the appeals court acknowledged there are more poor whites 
than blacks in the community it noted that only 7 percent of all 
huntington families needed subsidized housing while 24 percent of 
black families needed such help 
placing lowincome housing in predominantly white greenlawn will 
promote integration the 2nd circuit court said 
in other developments the supreme court 
said it will decide in cases from new york and virginia whether 
the government may seize money and property that criminal defendants 
use to pay their lawyers setting the stage for a ruling on a key 
crimefighting weapon 
refused to reinstate an unusual racial quota system designed to 
prevent white flight from a new york city public housing

coach who says he lost his job because he is white

an american student who was aboard a jordanian 
airliner seized by terrorists in 1985 says he is positive that 
hijacking defendant fawaz younis led the horde of men who 
stormed the plane in beirut 
i recognize him as the leader of the hijackers said william 
l slade pointing across a courtroom toward younis who was seated 
at the defense table 
how sure are you about that asked justice department 
prosecutor karen morrissette 
positive replied slade whose testimony monday in us 
district court marked the first time younis had been publicly 
identified by one of the victims of the june 11 1985 hijacking of a 
royal jordanian airline jet 
the boeing 727 was seized by five heavily armed men as it was 
preparing to take off for amman jordan 
about two minutes before takeoff i heard a great deal of 
gunfire outside the aircraft slade testified a whole horde of 
men stormed onto the airplane 
my gut instinct was to duck i crouched into my chair 
recalled slade the group started beating everything in their way 
onto the floor 
when things calmed down slade 21 said he noticed that two 
hijackers were standing at the rear of the plane and another was 
stationed in first class a fourth hijacker patrolled the aisle 
between the two sections of the cabin and the groups leader was in 
the cockpit 
the hijackers who took over the passenger section identified a 
group of five or six jordanian sky marshals and proceeded to beat 
them thoroughly and torture them 
none of the passengers was attacked by the hijackers he said 
slade said he could see the leader in the cockpit from where he 
was seated in the back of the plane next to his father landry 
slade a former professor at the american university in beirut 
slade said the hijackers leader emerged from the cockpit 10 
times during the 39hour ordeal in which the plane was ordered flown 
to cyprus tunisia sicily back to cyprus and then to beirut 
slade testified that younis came within four or five feet of him 
several times during the flight and that he got a good look at his 
face when he left the plane 
i shook his hand at the end of the ordeal i was very close 
him slade said recalling that he looked at younis in the eye 
the hijackers blew up the plane at beirut international airport 
shortly after the aircrafts 72 passengers and crew members were 
released younis was also photographed reading a statement at a 
press conference that the hijackers held before the plane was blown 
up 
the videotape is expected to be played at the end of this weeks 
hearing after five other hijacking victims including slades 
father testify 
us district judge barrington parker convened the hearing to 
determine whether to admit the eyewitness identification of younis 
as evidence when the case goes to trial next year 
the trial had been scheduled to begin nov 14 but the government 
is appealing an order that it turn over some classified documents to 
the defense 
slade said he knew younis was the leader of the group because he 
carried a twoway radio and barked orders when he emerged from the 
cockpit 
slade said younis was dressed in a flak jacket with a black 
headband around his head and wore green khaki pants 
the defendant was heavily armed and wore a vest that 
contained ammunition clips as well as hand grenades slade said 
younis mostly went to the passenger section of the plane to tell 
his fellow hijackers to stop beating the jordanian sky marshals 
slade said 
he said they followed younis orders but when he left the cabin 
the hijackers would start laughing and begin doing it again

federal regulators say a 50000 fine imposed 
on a california dialaporn company should demonstrate to other 
such operators that they must keep their material inaccessible to 
minors 
audio enterprises inc of mill valley calif and operator 
wendy king agreed to the fine and to stop using interstate telephone 
lines to transmit obscene messages 
it was one of the first dialaporn fines imposed by the federal 
communications commission 
the 50000 payment that the dialaporn operator will have to 
pay to the government shows that there will be a high price 
attached to failure to obey the law scrupulously in this important 
area gerald brock head of the fccs common carrier bureau said 
monday this sends a signal there are some teeth in the law 
fcc officials said audio enterprises is effectively out of 
business there was no current listing for the company in telephone 
information 
to resume operations king or audio enterprises must tone down 
the messages and use access codes credit cards or scrambling 
equipment to prevent children under 18 from dialing such operations 
will be monitored by the fcc according to the agreement 
the fcc launched its investigation of audio enterprises after a 
mother in california wrote that her 13yearold son and his friends 
spent 74 dialing a paytolisten 900number for 211 minutes 
also listening was the womans daughter who was later molested 
by two boys who had heard the tapes the woman wrote this phone 
call has damaged our lives the woman wrote 
the fcc informed audio enterprises last december that it was in 
apparent violation of fccs rules that require companies to restrict 
access to obscene material the commission also informed intercambio 
inc of san jose calif that it was in violation of the law that 
case is pending 
the fcc declared that the material broadcast by the two companies 
was obscene under a supreme courts test material is obscene if it 
depicts sexual acts in a patently offensive way appeals to the 
prurient interest of an average person and lacks serious literary or 
artistic value 
fcc officials estimated audio enterprises collected about 
250000 in revenues over a twoyear period 
altogether the dialaporn industry produces about 54 million 
annually in revenue for providers and phone companies according to 
the information industry bulletin 
the fcc has referred some complaints to the justice department 
in may 1987 two dialaporn providers pleaded guilty to failing to 
comply with the commissions rule the court fined them each 50000 
earlier this year congress passed a sweeping dialaporn law 
that bans obscene and indecent commercial messages the law has not 
been enforced because of legal challenges in new york and california

drexel burnham lambert inc the embattled wall 
street investment firm has been negotiating with former white house 
aide howard h baker jr about becoming its chairman the washington 
post reported today 
drexel is the subject of a massive civilfraud case and the 
target of a federal grand jury probe 
the post citing sources it did not identify reported that some 
senior drexel executives hoped bakers arrival would persuade 
manhattan us attorney rudolph w giuliani not to name the firm in 
an expected racketeering indictment 
baker reached late monday night at his home in huntsville 
tenn declined to comment on the report 
i cant give you anything on that now said the former 
tennessee senator and white house chief of staff 
drexel also declined to comment but it issued a statement 
acknowledging that it has been working with baker and his tennessee 
law firm on matters relating to internal corporate governance and 
which are unrelated to either the ongoing investigation by the us 
attorney or any washington matters 
it would be entirely inappropriate to comment or speculate on 
any subject which is under review or discussion between drexel 
baker and his law firm the statement said 
baker left the post of white house chief of staff last july and 
rejoined his knoxville law firm baker worthington crossley 
stansberry amp woolf 
sources cited by the post noted that baker in 1987 offered 
giuliani the post of chairman of the securities and exchange 
commission a job the prosecutor turned down 
drexels current chairman is robert e linton but the firms 
daytoday operations are supervised by chief executive fred joseph 
in a massive civil suit filed sept 7 the sec accused drexel and 
other defendants of scheming with nowimprisoned insider trader ivan 
boesky to break a litany of securitiesfraud laws the defendants 
have denied the accusations 
the suit was stalled last month when the 2nd circuit court of 
appeals in new york agreed to consider drexels request to 
disqualify the lowercourt judge presiding over the sec case 
meanwhile the manhattan us attorneys office which has been 
investigating drexels relationship with boesky since he turned 
states evidence almost two years ago is widely expected to seek 
indictments of the firm soon 
in october the us attorneys office notified drexel in a 
socalled target letter that a grand jury was considering 
whether to charge the firm with securities fraud under the 
racketeering influenced and corrupt organizations law drexel 
repeatedly has denied wrongdoing

one of his own creedence clearwater revival songs for his solo 
career

rights to creedence songs 
the suit one of several in a longrunning feud between fogerty 
and his former recording company claimed his 1984 composition

jungle which fogerty wrote and sang for creedence in 1970 
old man sold about 150000 copies and was the lead single 
from fogertys solo centerfield album his first major 
commercial success since creedence disbanded in 1972 the suit

album which sold more than 2 million copies 
fogertys defense included two days on the witness stand with 
guitar in hand playing many of his compositions to demonstrate his 
style he contended any similarities between the songs were part of 
his swamp rock style 
at a postverdict news conference fogerty 43 said william 
shakespeare john lennon bob dylan and maybe bruce springsteen 
were saying johnny dont blow this how can you not sound like 
yourself

the leader of the afghan resistance alliance is 
asking for us money to help refugees and to rehabilitate his 
wartorn country in talks today with state department officials 
there was no advance price tag as burhanuddin rabbani outlined 
his plans for afghanistans future at a session monday with 
undersecretary of state michael h armacost he gave an initial 
description of the elections he said he wants to hold in january to 
select a new government in kabul 
a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
rabbani did not ask for additional american military aid to carry 
out the guerrillas fight against promoscow government forces 
they didnt come in pressing for more guns the official 
said they are confident of their ability to see this war to its 
end 
although the level of us military support remains secret the 
rebels are believed to have received several hundred million dollars 
in recent years much of the aid including shoulderfired stinger 
missiles is channeled through pakistan 
rabbani who sees president reagan and secretary of state george 
p shultz on wednesday is the leader of the islamic society 
guerrilla group and of the main rebel alliance he had talks 
scheduled today with assistant secretary of state richard 
williamson who coordinates humanitarian aid to the rebels and with 
the agency for international development 
it was a very cordial meeting a us official reported after 
mondays session there was a restating of our support for the 
mujahedeen both sides gave their assessment of the issues 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said rabbani 
and armacost just touched on the guerrilla leaders plan and 
that it would receive more extensive consideration later in the week 
the reagan administration already has registered its general 
support for a political settlement provided it involves 
selfdetermination for the afghan people before rabbanis arrival 
us officials said his plan which would exclude communists 
offered a promising channel to that end 
reports from pakistan which also backs the rebels indicated 
rabbani may ask for more advanced weapons from the united states 
but the guerrillas are making gains with the arms they already have 
and a us official said it would seem they are wellfixed 
rabbanis plan for a new government involves negotiating a 
ceasefire with afghan forces even the introduction of soviet 
backfire and mig warplanes and ss1 scud missiles have not averted 
the governments impending loss of knadahar the countrys 
secondlargest city 
the state department has counseled the guerrillas to exercise 
restraint toward soviet troops all of which are supposed to be out 
of the country by feb 15 but the rebels have not been asked to 
take it easy on the afghan forces 
half the more than 100000 soviet troops in the country since 
1979 were withdrawn aug 15 but last week soviet first deputy 
foreign minister alexander bessmertynkh said the pullout had been 
suspended because of strong attacks by the rebels 
state department spokesman charles e redman said monday that the 
united states still expects the soviets to comply with the 
obligation that they have undertaken in the geneva accords last 
spring 
he said the soviets fired three more scud missiles into eastern 
afghanistan on sunday and the soviets continued their air operations 
over the weekend

its taken patience and ingenuity but a 
crime lab has finally stopped thieves from pilfering the countys 
stash of confiscated marijuana the mice are gone 
brazoria county crime lab director michael manes says workers 
decided something had to be done because the critters became bolder 
and bolder as they developed a love for their newfound food kept in 
a vault 
because the drug had given them a false sense of security it got 
to the point where the mice simply would sit and stare at workers 
when they opened the darkened vault rather than scurry from the 
light said manes 
the first move against the mice was to place drugs that might be 
needed in court cases in steel cabinets so no evidence would be 
destroyed 
but an attempt to catch the mice with poisoned food met with 
little success because they seemed to prefer marijuana seeds to 
cheese the cheese rotted as the bags of marijuana continued to be 
gnawed open 
manes said about the only luck they had in catching the mice was 
when one would accidentally step on a trap as it walked from one bag 
of pot to another 
we soon just put them around the room without any bait and 
hoped theyd stumble into one he said 
a combination of poisoned marijuana poisoned water and traps has 
nearly wiped out the labs mouse population 
but a large jar of preserved rodent bodies serves as a reminder 
that the penalty for marijuanaeating mice at the lab is death

as president reagan bade a sentimental farewell 
to white house politics and urged voters to stand by me his 
pollster predicted that vice president george bush would win the 
presidency with a comfortable electoral margin today 
i dont think its going to be a close race pollster richard 
wirthlin told reporters aboard air force one monday as he 
accompanied the president to california where reagan wound up a 
25000mile political odyssey with an outdoor rally in san diego 
i am confident george bush will get over 300 electors 
wirthlin said and on the up side add another 80 to that 
it takes 270 to win 
in his speech at an outdoor plaza in san diego the same city 
where he ended his own two presidential campaigns reagan pulled out 
the emotional stops in an appeal for californias 47 electoral votes 
this year my name is not on the ballot the 77yearold 
president said and it wont appear on a ballot ever again 
unless you count the one that someone up there casts when your time 
is done and the moment has arrived for his verdict which when all 
is said and done is the only election that really counts 
stand by the republican ticket and i dont mind if you stand 
by me he said 
on the way back to washington white house chief of staff kenneth 
duberstein told reporters that reagan was feeling real upbeat 
that last speech was very emotional hes feeling psyched he feels 
he gave it his best shot for george bush in california 
the traveling white house staff threw a party for the president 
with a cake inscribed with the message he had delivered so often 
during his 30 campaign stops in 16 states since labor day win one 
for the gipper 
fitzwater said reagan ate a piece of cake and drank a glass of 
champagne 
there is a lot of sentimentality to this journey wirthlin 
told reporters and the thing that makes it so important is that 
california is still very close we show it dead even and it could go 
either way 
wirthlin said the bush campaign asked reagan to make the trip 
and he was happy to do so he also said reagan told him it was 
the first time he could recall flying to california and back in one 
day 
fitzwater said the president and his wife nancy would watch the 
election returns on television tonight in the family quarters of the 
white house they were expected to be joined by about 20 family 
friends and associates in the administration

reagan at the white house after flying back to washington from 
houston 
reagan spoke outside the queen mary hotel a converted ocean 
liner in long beach before going to his farewell rally in san 
diego but the san diego speech was the emotional high point of the 
day 
a son of jack and nelle reagan never walked away from a battle 
on principle the president said invoking the memory of his 
parents 
this years election is that kind of fight and by darn 
were going to win it he said

the defense minister and a former 
ambassador to the united states say the leftist sandinista 
government will seek negotiations with the new us administration 
regardless of who wins todays election 
we hope that they accept what the whole world clearly 
understands the defeat of the war policy and civilized 
negotiations defense minister gen humberto ortega said monday 
the general brother of president daniel ortega made the remark 
after an army promotion ceremony in managua 
facing a new administration whether it be democrat or 
republican nicaraguas position will be the same the search for a 
negotiated solution former ambassador carlos tunnerman wrote in 
mondays barricada the official sandinista newspaper 
wilfredo montalvan a contra leader said the rebels too will 
seek a meeting to determine if the new government of either bush 
or dukakis will continue to support the war to defeat once and for 
all the sandinista government 
sandinista leaders say neither vice president george bush nor 
gov michael dukakis would be better than president reagan 
washington cut off economic aid to nicaragua in 1981 declaring 
the country a beachhead for communism in central america and a 
threat to us national security the reagan administration supports 
the contras whom the sandinistas claim are a creation of the united 
states 
there has been no serious contact between washington and managua 
since early 1985 when the united states broke off direct talks 
tunnerman said if bush wins he has already said he is 
disposed to solicit more military aid for the contras its 
possible that he will not have the same fervor or the same 
enthusiasm of reagan 
he said dukakis vow to end aid to the contras does not mean he 
can dismantle from one day to the other what has been the policy for 
eight years 
tunnerman was expelled from the united states in july in response 
to nicaraguas expulsion of us ambassador richard melton 
montalvan a director of the nicaraguan resistance said the 
rebels would reject us military aid if it were provided only to 
pressure the sandinistas into democratic reforms 
we cannot allow our people to continue to sacrifice themselves 
just to keep pressure on the sandinistas he said in a telephone 
interview from miami 
most contras fled nicaragua for honduras after us military aid 
expired in february they currently draw on a 27million 
humanitarian aid package approved by the us congress 
the sandinistas and rebels signed a ceasefire pact in march but 
each side accuses the other of violations talks on a permanent 
truce in the 7yearold civil war broke down in september 
the conflict has claimed 26500 lives by government count

democrats were favored to retake the governors office in indiana 
and west virginia and were locked in tighterthanever races with 
gop incumbents in rhode island and utah today as voters in 12 states

montana also held the possibility that the governors office 
might change party hands with the candidates in a dead heat to 
succeed democrat ted schwinden 
utah gov norm bangerter overcoming the stigma of a record 166 
million tax increase in 1987 erased an early 30point deficit in

dakota vermont and washington 
evan bayh son of former us sen birch e bayh was favored to 
become indianas first democratic governor office in 20 years 
although his lead appeared to be slipping the 32yearold indiana 
secretary of state would also be the youngest us governor in 
office 
an indianapolis star poll published oct 30 gave him a 5440 lead 
over republican lt gov john m mutz but a statewide poll by the 
public opinion laboratory at indiana universitypurdue university at 
indianapolis and released monday showed likely voters splitting 501 
percent for bayh to 463 for mutz the gop hoped a big bushquayle 
victory in sen dan quayles home state would help pull mutz 
through it was quayle who ousted the elder bayh from the senate in 
1980 
in west virginia republican arch moore seeking an unprecedented 
fourth term fought for his political life his opponent democrat 
gaston caperton an insurance executive and political novice has 
called the election a referendum on the economy in west virginia 
which has one of the nations highest unemployment rates and had to 
borrow 80 million from its investments this year to pay its bills 
because of a slump in coal and other industries 
a poll oct 31 and nov 1 gave caperton a 5135 lead unchanged 
from midoctober but moore is a 65yearold political warhorse who 
has made a career overcoming the odds in predominantly democratic 
west virginia 
people know arch moore hasnt delivered and that i will 
deliver caperton said 
in rhode island sundlun a communications executive who lost to 
diprete by a landslide in 1986 robbed the governor of an early 
commanding lead by raising questions about dipretes private 
business deals alleged favoritism in the awarding of state 
contracts and the hiring of the exwife of a reputed mobster for a 
state job diprete has stressed the states economic recovery 
two tv station polls last week had the candidates one point apart 
the bangerter campaign in utah also counted on a strong showing 
by vice president george bush the governors comeback largely 
coincided with bushs surge since the republican national convention 
in august the outcome may also hinge on whether independent merrill 
cook who ran on a taxlimitation platform can hold the support of 
conservatives 
two polls issued sunday had wilson the former mayor of salt lake 
city 2 points ahead of bangerter with 37 percent and even with the 
governor at 36 percent cook had 26 percent and 24 percent 
its always scary to see those polls drop but 15 months ago

than 4 points said wilson campaign manager rob jolley 
montanas thomas judge democratic governor from 1973 to 1981 
and republican state sen stan stephens claimed late momentum in a 
campaign over how to revive the states economy a poll late last

republican george bush offered a reprise of his 
speeches and television ads and democrat michael dukakis confessed 
that i dont wear my heart on my sleeve as the presidential 
candidates took their final shots at the livingroom audience 
the candidates halfhour television programs monday night were 
as different and typical as their campaigns 
dukakis subjected himself to blunt and unflattering questions 
from wellmeaning people all around the country while bush 
presented a highly polished documentary that drew extensively on his 
convention acceptance speech and several commercials dropped 
virtually unedited into the program 
dukakis showcased his running mate sen lloyd bentsen along 
with the citizenquestioners and a few scenes with his family bush 
featured his wife his children his grandchildren police chiefs 
charlton heston and president reagan even his media adviser roger 
ailes had an offscreen speaking part but there was no mention of 
bushs running mate sen dan quayle considered a drag on the 
ticket 
within the first few seconds of his program dukakis was shown 
both in shirtsleeves at a town meeting and in a booklined room 
wearing a red pullover sweater he later appeared playing the 
trumpet dancing with his wife and doing an imitation of a radio 
broadcaster who wrongly announced that dewey had defeated truman 
maybe i dont wear my heart on my sleeve but my passion is in 
my service to the public said the massachusetts governor 
explaining himself to a questioner who asked why he didnt show 
emotion 
dukakis also defended himself against many of the issues raised 
by bush including his crime record and his military policy if 
elected he told one questioner you can bet your life that 
this nation will be defended and defended well 
surrounded by his family he pledged to be a fine president a 
good leader and somebody you can be proud of 
bush with background music and rhetoric echoing reagans 
campaigns vowed that if you elect me president you will be 
better off four years from now than you are today he also said he 
had the experience to be a steady hand guiding our country 
while the tone of the programs was not harsh the candidates did 
not refrain from criticizing each other 
the vice president in an excerpt from his acceptance speech 
attacked dukakis for opposing the death penalty school prayer and a 
massachusetts bill that would have required teachers to lead the 
pledge of allegiance 
elsewhere in the broadcast bush reiterated his criticism of the 
massachusetts prison furlough program and he said dukakis has no 
experience in national security affairs i dont believe we can take 
a risk on an issue as important as our national security 
dukakis attacked republican agricultural policy and charged that 
the gop would balance the budget by cutting social security and he 
belittled what he called the only new idea george bush has had 
since this campaign began a new 40 billion fiveyear capital 
gains tax giveaway for the very rich 
now who is going to pay for that tax break dukakis demanded 
of an enthusiastic audience at a rally look beside you look 
behind you look in the mirror and ask yourself is george bush on 
your side 
it was left to bentsen to complain about bushs hardball media 
strategy the people of texas have been outraged by the 
distortions the republicans have made with their commercial tv he 
said and he contended that voters are also deeply concerned 
about the choice of quayle

the governments top law and order official 
resigned after a greekamerican banker indicted in a 30million 
scandal escaped police surveillance and fled the country 
opposition conservatives immediately demanded the resignation of 
premier andreas papandreous socialist government claiming george 
koskotas was permitted to escape so he would not implicate top 
government officials in allegedly illegal financial deals 
koskotas 34 fled sunday apparently by yacht said a police 
officer 
speaking on condition of anonymity the officer said koskotas 
sailed from the village of megalo pefko 20 miles from athens and 
his whereabouts were unknown 
public order minister tassos sehiotis whose ministry was 
responsible for police surveillance of koskotas said he submitted 
his resignation monday since such omissions create an issue of 
political sensitivity 
he said a warrant has been issued for koskotas arrest 
one week ago the banker was banned from leaving greece while 
officials investigated alleged financial irregularities at the bank 
of crete which he had controlled 
greek newspapers have charged that senior socialist officials 
have been involved in illegal deals set up by koskotas 
the greek people are left with the conviction that george 
koskotas was spirited away so that he would not speak the 
responsibility goes all the way to the top of the government 
pyramid said constantine mitsotakis leader of the main 
opposition new democracy party he demanded the government resign 
the government last week pledged to uncover the scandal and 
warned there would be no pardons for members of the governing 
panhellenic socialist movement who may be implicated 
critics also have lambasted the government for permitting 
koskotas to build a multimillion dollar banking and media empire 
without adequately checking his financial background 
koskotas was suspended oct 20 as bank of crete chairman and 
indicted on five counts of forgery and embezzlement he was given 
until nov 14 to prepare his defense 
koskotas who holds both american and greek citizenship bought a 
controlling interest in the bank of crete in 1984 after working in 
its central athens branch for six years as an accountant 
rival newspapers claim koskotas illegally used bank of crete 
money to finance his publishing group grammi which controls three 
daily newspapers five magazines and a radio station 
last weekend shipowner aristides alafouzos paid 63 million for 
the most presitigious grammi title the conservative daily 
kathimerini 
koskotas parents brother wife and five children all have left 
greece during the past week 
the banker grew up in the united states in 1975 he was fined 
200 in new york for falsifying college letterheads 
in october 1987 he was arrested in washington dc for alleged 
social security fraud but was allowed to return to greece after 
posting 1 million bond that case attracted wide publicity in 
athens but the government ignored calls for a thorough 
investigation of koskotas affairs

a ship that spent more than two years 
searching for a place to leave thousands of tons of city incinerator 
ash finally disposed of the cargo after rejection by at least seven 
countries an attorney says 
bruce phillips representing a company hired by the city to get 
rid of the waste said monday he received a document last week 
saying the ash has been disposed of but not where or when 
phillips who represents joseph paolino amp sons inc said the 
document was sent as a fax from romo shipping corp which he 
believes is the ships owner to amalgamated shipping co the 
vessels former owner 
the ship underwent repairs in yugoslavia in august it is 
believed the ownership of the khian sea changed hands and that the 
ship was renamed the felicia said jim vallette a spokesman for the 
environmental group greenpeace 
vallette said the international organization believes the ash 
estimated at 10000 to nearly 15000 tons was dumped in the 
vicinity of the indian ocean 
vallette said the ship unsuccessfully attempted to dispose of the 
ash in sri lanka in midoctober 
over the past three weeks weve sent notices to every country 
bordering the indian ocean warning them of the cargo the ship is 
carrying he said 
vallette said phillips received the copy of the document 
thursday indicating the ash was dumped before then 
phillips would not say when or how he received the copy 
he said he is preparing a motion arguing that romo amalgamated 
and others are in civil contempt for defying an injunction filed 
june 2 phillips said the injunction prohibits dumping or disposing 
the ash without notifying his client of a plan in advance 
its aggravating because it is already a fait accompli the 
lawyer said of the disposal 
joseph paolino amp sons cannot receive payment from the city unless 
it can show the ash has been disposed of in an environmentally 
sound manner phillips said 
the ship began its journey sept 5 1986 with 15000 tons of 
incinerated philadelphia trash and has traveled to central america 
south america and the mideast in search of a place to dispose of it 
the ship unloaded about 3000 tons of the cargo in haiti before 
leaving under government orders last february haiti ordered the 
cargo returned to the ship before it left but an undetermined 
amount was left behind 
efforts to dispose of the ash in the bahamas the dominican 
republic honduras costa rica guineabissau and the cape verde 
islands also proved unsuccessful 
vallette said greenpeace could not determine where romo is 
located although he said it is believed to be a middle eastern 
company possibly egyptian 
although greenpeace has labeled the ships cargo toxic the state 
found no problems with the ash when it was originally loaded tests 
by the state department of environmental resources and the federal 
environmental protection agency while the ship waited fruitlessly in 
the delaware bay to return to philadelphia also found it to be safe 
the ships journey recalls the fivemonth odyssey last year of a 
garbage barge carrying 3100 tons of trash from islip ny the 
barge was spurned by alabama mississippi texas florida mexico 
belize and the bahamas before returning to new york and dumping the 
trash in brooklyn

a witness in former miss america bess myersons 
divorcefixing trial denied prosecution allegations that the 
onetime cultural affairs commissioner tried to buy him off with the 
prospect of a job 
i explained it to those guys federal prosecutors there its 
a joke a longstanding joke between us walter canter said in a 
telephone interview monday evening 
believe me its a nonstory 
canter a former journalist who worked as a speechwriter for miss 
myerson for 15 years testified monday that she fired him in 1983 
from his job at the citys department of cultural affairs 
he said he had not heard from her until two or three weeks ago 
when she telephoned him 
defense lawyers immediately objected and us district judge 
john keenan conferred privately with prosecutors and defense lawyers 
before barring any further testimony about the call 
according to a transcript released later assistant us attorney 
told keenan that miss myerson told canter that she was thinking of 
starting a foundation and that she thought he would be a good person 
to head the foundation 
is there anything more the judge asked is it that the 
inference is to be drawn that she was trying to buy him off by 
offering him something at a foundation 
i think that is a fair inference abrams said adding that 
canter sort of made light of it he essentially sloughed it 
off 
i think its an ambiguous conversation said miss myersons 
attorney frederick hafetz 
carter said monday night that miss myerson was trying to have 
her sense of humor come out that is something when you are between 
a rock and a hard place to have your sense of humor 
the lawyers and defendants have been ordered by the judge not to 
discuss the case outside court 
miss myerson 64 is on trial with her lover carl andy 
capasso 43 and former state supreme court justice hortense gabel 
75 who made rulings in capassos divorce 
miss myerson is accused of giving a 19000ayear city job to 
mrs gabels daughter sukhreet to influence the judges decision 
in the divorce case 
the judges daughter was hired in august 1983 less than a month 
later mrs gabel cut capassos temporary alimony and child support 
payments to his estranged wife 
canter testified monday that he had rewritten a resume for miss 
gabel he said he had written speeches and ghostwritten magazine 
articles for miss myerson from 1968 to 1983 
he said that when he went with miss myerson to the cultural 
affairs agency he did not have to go through a city interview 
process his resume was not submitted for review and he did not have 
the qualifications required for the job title he operated under 
i wasnt aware of titles canter testified 
miss myerson was familiar with my background and the work i had 
done he added i knew what i had been brought in to do and i 
did it 
testimony is scheduled to resume wednesday

lloyd bentsen ended a final marathon 
campaign swing in his home state today still defiant of polls 
showing the democratic ticket trailing 
more than a hundred supporters greeted him at the austin airport 
for a welcome home ceremony that featured sparklers a spotlight 
entrance and a buddy holly tune 
to the end as he stumped through texas louisiana arkansas and 
missouri on election eve he insisted the polls were turning around 
and that he and democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
would win 
he raced through eight cities in 19 hours finally winding up a 
day of virtually continuous campaigning with the upbeat rally at 3 
am est 
no retreat baby no surrender vowed the 67yearold 
chairman of the senate finance committee quoting a song by rock and 
roll star bruce springsteen 
bentsen was to spend election evening in austin visiting with 
campaign workers and then waiting for the results in his hotel room 
the democratic celebration was being held in the driskill hotel 
where lyndon johnson spent election eve in 1960 
also like lbj bentsen was on the ballot today for reelection to 
his senate seat under texas law he can run for both offices and he 
has promised to resign the senate if he wins the vice presidency 
polls released just prior to election day indicated the ticket 
was still trailing republicans george bush and dan quayle although 
the gap narrowed to just a few points 
dukakis was campaigning around the clock and bentsen wasnt far 
behind his day started at about 7 am monday and didnt end until 
past 2 am cst tuesday he hit eight cities five in texas and one 
each in arkansas louisiana and missouri 
in kansas city his last major campaign stop several hundred 
supporters jammed into a hotel ballroom when he spoke at nearly 
midnight 
the momentum is with us its going our way he told them 
the final message was simple 
were on your side and theyre not he repeated at every 
stop echoing dukakis classconscious argument that the democrats 
care more about middleincome needs such as health care housing 
and social security republican negative advertising was distorting 
that message he said 
in houston where a crowd of 3000 greeted him bentsen said he 
could remember how jack kennedy and lyndon johnson carried 
texas surrounded by family and political allies he asserted 
we carry texas and we carry it all 
late in the day bentsen added to his stump speech the 
springsteen line reporters asked afterward if he were a springsteen 
fan 
i am now he replied upbeat despite the grueling schedule 
you bet baby

hundreds of karen guerrillas joined by 
students who fled government repression in major cities today 
battled burmese troops trying to retake this base near the thai 
border guerrilla commanders said 
the students numbering about 130 recently joined the guerrillas 
in frontline fighting for the first time said the commanders who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the rebel leaders said the students received four weeks of 
military training from the ethnic minority karens who have for four 
decades been waging a war for greater autonomy 
more than 5000 students and other protestors fled to the karens 
after a military coup sept 18 and a ruthless suppression of a 
peoples power uprising in which more than 450 people died 
the students along with as many as 1000 guerrillas of the karen 
national union are trying to beat back burmese reinforcements 
attempting to retake several hills around the camp the guerrilla 
commanders said 
mae tah waw is on a key karen transport and communications route 
where the karens tax the massive smuggling trade between thailand 
and burma that includes gems consumer items antiques livestock 
and teak 
the battle for mae tah waw began in early october when the karens 
launched attacks against the encampment and a series of surrounding 
hills that the burmese army captured in 1984 
the camp located on the moei river about 80 miles north of the 
key thai border town of mae sot had until then been inhabited by an 
unknown number of karen civilians and guerrillas 
the karens seized the burmese base and three hills in the third 
week of october and were attempting to dislodge remnants from a 
fourth when according to president bo mya of the karen national 
union the burmese moved in 10 battalions of reinforcements in 
recent days 
the burmese force strung out westward into thickly jungled 
country is estimated at 2000 to 3000 
most of the 130 students were reported counterattacking the 
reinforcements 
we need more weapons operation commander gen hla thoo told 
reporters he said the students would relieve karen guerrillas and 
use their rifles since there were not enough to go around 
in recent days the karens have been ferrying in their own 
reinforcements on motor launches along the moei river which forms 
the border between thailand and burma here 
the students have vowed to wage war against the rangoon 
government which sent troops into the streets of burmas cities to 
gun down demonstrators and put an end to a prodemocracy movement 
that reached its height in july 
also today thailands deputy foreign minister prapas 
limpabandhu said he will visit burma for trade and border talks 
this month breaking the international isolation of the new military 
government 
prapas will be leading the first official foreign delegation to 
burma since military commander gen saw maung seized power in the 
sept 18 coup 
the world community has informally cooperated in refraining from 
any moves that would imply formal recognition of the saw maung 
government 
thai foreign minister siddhi savetsila said prapas visit did not 
necessarily mean thailand will recognize the current government

a study concludes that seattles weaker gun control 
laws probably explain why the risk of being killed with a handgun 
there is five times higher than in nearby vancouver british 
columbia 
the researchers said that seattle has a higher overall homicide 
rate than vancouver and virtually all of the difference can be 
explained by the citys higher incidence of handgun shootings 
the researchers cautioned that similar studies should be done in 
other cities but they said their work suggests that a more 
restrictive approach to handgun control may decrease national 
homicide rates 
the study directed by dr john henry sloan of harborview medical 
center in seattle is being published in thursdays new england 
journal of medicine 
the researchers noted that vancouver and seattle are similar 
large cities 140 miles apart in the pacific northwest however the 
canadian city has tougher gun laws 
in vancouver selfdefense is not a legal reason to buy a 
handgun and concealed weapons are not allowed permits are required 
to buy and transport handguns and those obtained for recreation can 
be fired only at licensed shooting clubs 
opponents of gun control argue that limiting access to guns will 
have little effect on homicide rates because those who want to kill 
will find ways to obtain guns or will use other weapons 
however the researchers said vancouvers rate of homicides with 
other kinds of weapons was not significantly higher than seattles 
suggesting that few wouldbe assailants switched to homicide by 
other methods 
other findings of the sevenyear study included 
the risk of being a homicide victim in seattle was 63 percent 
higher than in vancouver virtually all the increased risk in 
seattle was due to a fivefold higher risk of homicide by firearms 
almost all of them handguns 
the rates of burglary robbery and assult were similar in the 
two cities 
indians had the highest homicide rates in both cities 
asians in seattle had higher homicide rates than their 
counterparts in vancouver but there was little differences in other 
racial groups between the two cities 
in an accompanying editorial drs james a mercy and vernon n 
houk of the us centers for disease control in atlanta said the 
research is a step toward studying gun control in a scientific way 
they said more such work should be done

a blue jeanwearing teacher 
suspended for not wearing a tie to class says a dress code 
compromise that bans dungarees sounds like a stinking deal 
superintendent charles chambers on monday offered the compromise 
which would allow math teacher bill webb to return to work without a 
tie webb said he has not worn a tie to class in at least 15 of his 
20 years as an educator 
chambers who has suspended the 46yearold teacher three times 
this school year for not wearing a tie said webb faces charges of 
insubordination and could be dismissed if he wont agree to the 
dress code changes 
im not an unreasonable person although ive been painted as 
one the superintendent said 
in a meeting monday night in this county seat on the ohio river 
the mason county board of education opened a twoweek period on the 
changes 
members of two teachers unions met last week to develop a new 
dress code during the weekend chambers added the ban on jeans and 
denim 
its a dress code policy formulated in conjunction with the 
teachers he said its sort of a middle ground ties will be 
recommended but not required 
chambers said that if webb agrees to the new code the board 
would be willing to drop further penalties he said he would 
recommend webb be fired if he doesnt change his mind the board has 
scheduled a hearing dec 1 on webbs latest suspension 
it sounds like a stinking deal webb said of chambers offer 
hes still breaching my original contract with the board for 1988 
hes adding conditions 
they can do it next year before contract time he cant do it 
this year 
unless the ohio river starts flowing north i expect the 
board to fire me said webb 
the tie requirement was imposed through a memo chambers issued 
shortly before school opened 
webb and other teachers contend the dress code is not valid 
because it was issued after they signed their contracts for the 
current school year 
the county board on monday rejected grievances filed by three 
teachers over the current dress code a union spokesman said they 
would appeal 
webbs latest suspension lasting 30 days began on halloween he 
has spent his time chopping wood and doing other chores around his 
farm outside gallipolis ohio 
he also has a state hearing on his second suspension scheduled 
nov 15 in charleston before an education employees hearing board 
about 60 people many supporting webb jammed the boards small 
meeting room one held a sign asking does being on the best 
dressed list make a successful teacher 
rescind the webb suspension and get the mason county school 
system back to normal again and get bill webb back in the classroom 
where he belongs said bob brown of the west virginia federation 
of teachers 
by your own assessment hes a good teacher our children are 
the losers brown told the board 
webb teaches 124 of point pleasant high schools 695 students 
and chambers bristled when west virginia education association 
representative ed stephenson implied the dispute had disrupted 
teaching 
if i was a teacher in mason county id be insulted by your 
remarks chambers said

protestant and roman catholic church leaders 
from northern ireland and the irish republic ended their 
pilgrimage of hope on a note of optimism that the troubled 
british province might soon know peace 
were realizing there is no such thing as green catholic 
tears or orange protestant tears the people of ireland are 
weeping together and this is significant david bleakley 
secretary of the irish council of churches said monday 
bleakley was one of six highlevel church delegates from the four 
leading denominations of northern ireland and the republic who 
participated in a threeday ecumenical institute in this boston 
suburb 
a good seed has been planted and surely the harvest will be 
bountiful the rev james hiles of the episcopal church of our 
savior said at a news conference the church sponsored the gathering 
to mark the 90th anniversary of the churchs founding in part by 
irish immigrants 
the religious leaders also urged americans to refrain from 
sending donations to paramilitary organizations that will destroy 
our beloved island 
the most rev robin eames archbishop of irelands anglican 
church said the delegation was flatly opposed to misguided american 
donations to northern ireland whose current outbreak of political 
and sectarian violence began in 1969 
our message is pure and simple money given to paramilitary 
organizations is money for death money for misery and money for 
injury it is pushing back the chance for reconciliation and peace 
in ireland eames said 
many groups in the united states including the ireland fund 
irish northern aid committee and the ancient order of hibernians 
solicit funds for distribution in ireland none acknowledge giving 
funds for military use by factions such as the roman catholic irish 
republican army 
bleakley joined his interdominational colleagues in urging 
americans to closely monitor their donations dont take chances 
with american dollars he said weve shed tears and suffered 
because of money that has come generously from america and been used 
woefully 
the delegation also included bishop cahal b daly whose roman 
catholic diocese includes belfast the presbyterian moderator in 
ireland dr godfrey brown the rev charles eyre general secretary 
of the methodist church in ireland and the rev robert davidson 
professor of old testament at the university of glasgow 
the clerics called northern irelands conflict a young persons 
tragedy and urged educational integration to promote 
crosscultural communication 
eames stressed that education was but a part of what he said must 
be a peaceful formula for political reform 
it would be wrong if we were to give the impression that 
education will be the answer to our problems it is just a part of 
the jigsaw puzzle he said

after 182 years as an allmale 
preserve grim highsecurity dartmoor prison has appointed a granny 
and a nanny as its first women guards 
its just a job we have always known we could do these jobs 
just as well as the men lynn draperrush 40 told a news 
conference monday 
she and exnanny melanie maccallum 26 began work after a 
13week training course at the home office the government 
department responsible for police and prisons 
the jail built in 1806 to house french prisoners captured during 
the napoleonic wars has a reputation as one of britains grimmest 
and toughest 
murderers and rapists are among the 630 inmates it confines in 
the middle of dartmoor a remote area of high windswept moorland in 
southwest england in the past when convicts were sentenced to the 
nowabolished punishment of hard labor gangs of dartmoor prisoners 
spent their days breaking rocks out on the moors in all weathers 
many had their health permanently wrecked by the arduous toil 
the village of princetown consists mostly of the homes of the 250 
prison guards and their families 
prison governor john may said he requested two women guards for 
the prison under britains equal opportunities legislation which 
abolishes sexual discrimination in the work place 
he said their appointment would be good for morale in the prison 
it is rare for women to work in mens prisons may said mrs 
draperrush a former police catering officer and mrs maccallum 
would work on equal terms with the male guards in most respects but 
would not go into the prisoners bathhouse or search inmates 
like the male guards the two women will earn 23541 a year and 
work a 47hour week 
severe overcrowding poor facilities old buildings and 
increasingly rebellious inmates have contributed in recent years to 
escalating rioting and other violence in britains ailing prison 
service 
guards are unarmed in british prisons but trained in unarmed 
combat

a japanese toymaker is donating more 
than 250000 in toys to poor children in san francisco as a apology 
for selling little black sambo dolls in japan 
sanrio toy co whose us operations are based here also has 
stopped making the sambo character and two similar blackfaced toys 
sanrio came under attack in july when the washington post carried 
a story describing the popularity in japan of black caricatures 
based on little black sambo a childrens book figure created by 
british author helen bannerman in 1898 
sanrio executives apologized immediately and yanked 15 million 
worth of the offending sambo hanna and bibinba characters from the 
companys 3000 boutiques throughout japan 
sanrio executives met with members of the congressional black 
caucus last week to propose a 257000 toy distribution to poor 
children a japanus childrens exchange and the development of 
multiracial characters for a monthly magazine the company publishes 
for its millions of young japanese customers 
kurt yonezawa vice president of sanrio america inc said 
apologies while appropriate are not enough 
love and friendship for other people is sanrios philosophy so 
it was natural for mne to come up with this idea he said 
the congressional black caucus has been fighting racial 
stereotyping by japanese companies operating in the united states 
and called the sanrio move a victory

future teachers from a small nebraska 
college are seeing firsthand what their students may be like by 
spending time in some of this citys worst neighborhoods 
the visits are part of a course at hastings college to educate 
future teachers about the difficulties faced by urban minorities as 
well as the positive aspects of their lives 
the lastest group a class of 18 mostly white middleclass 
students ends their fiveday visit today 
they saw abused and neglected children homeless people drug 
busts and a single mother taking care of seven children in a 
oneroom house 
its so easy to look the other way said kim sperber who 
grew up in a white middleclass family in a denver suburb i 
never had a reason to go down to the city so i didnt 
you may see some bums and some bag ladies and thats enough 
said student john roebke you dont want to see any more you 
dont want to find out how bad it really is people who live in 
suburbs or better areas are just isolated and ignorant that 
situations like that exist in their own cities 
the course is required of all education majors at the small 
liberal arts college in hastings in south central nebraska 
enrollment is about 800 
the majority of our students come from smalltown and ranching 
families said jan watkins an education professor who directs the 
course even those who come from large urban areas do not look at 
the city and ethnic groups as this class forces them to do 
the students visited minority schools toured a shelter for the 
homeless attended sunday services at a black church ate mexican 
and soul food watched counselors work with abused children and rode 
the streets with police officers 
everybodys blind to whats going on down there student 
scott rezac said people wait until the last minute to do 
something people wait to help the kids in detention until theyre 
in detention i didnt see one place for the kids to go at night 
like a gymnasium or any recreation centers 
the class called the multicultural experience started about 
eight years ago after national accrediting organizations told 
colleges to develop courses for a greater understanding of minority 
issues 
it was offered as an elective during a winter before it was 
developed into a semesterlong requirement 
through the negatives the students did find some signs of hope 
at a detention center workers were really trying to make a 
change in the kids lives wayne wiens said it wasnt just a 
place to lock them back up 
and at a school all the students seemed like they were glad to 
be there they wanted to learn angie life said

angry at the choice of a new sultan to lead 
nigerias 50 million moslems thousands of people rioted in a 
northwestern town torching government offices and freeing 2000 
prisoners staterun radio reported today 
an independent lagos newspaper said at least three people died in 
mondays rioting at sokoto 465 miles north of the capital in kano 
province the guardian express quoted no source and did not 
elaborate 
staterun radio nigeria mentioned no casualties and did not 
estimate damage which was inflicted a day after the provincial 
military governor approved the appointment of ibrahim dasuki as 
sultan of kano 
reporters in lagos said people believed the military forced the 
committee of moslem elders that selected the new sultan to choose 
dasuki instead of the elder son of the late sultan sadiq abubakar 
as sultan dasuki leads nigerias moslems nearly half the people 
of black africas most powerful and populous nation he is revered 
by moslems of neighboring west african states and he wields 
political power as the sultan is consulted by nigerian leaders of 
all denominations 
abubakar was sultan for 50 years until he died last week dasuki 
is a 56yearold former civil servant 
state radio said tension started building friday in sokoto a 
predominately moslem town after local stateowned rima radio 
announced that muhammadu maccido abubakers elder son had been 
appointed successor 
police arrested the stations general manager and four employees 
after the announcement rima radio later reported the ninemember 
selection committee of moslem elders called kingmakers had not yet 
decided 
anticipating trouble when the true announcement was made 
authorities deployed police to strategic buildings and into the 
streets 
but radio nigeria said they fled when they saw the crowd of 
thousands who set fire to the radio station building before 
marching on sokoto prison and freeing all the inmates 
rioters set alight the administrative block of the health 
ministry and the local branch of the luxembourgbased bank of credit 
and commerce international dasuki is chairman of the banks local 
board 
there also was a power failure but it was not immediately clear 
if it was connected with the rioting 
troops were called in and together with police twice repulsed 
demonstrators attempts to storm the sultans palace radio nigeria 
said frustrated rioters then blocked streets with burning tires and 
billboards and damaged several public and private vehicles 
security forces managed to get most rioters to disperse by monday 
afternoon though sporadic disturbances continued around the palace 
and sokotos main market the radio said

contributing to the variance in poll estimates of george bushs 
advantage 
national surveys as late as this morning found bush maintaining 
his monthsold lead over michael dukakis but the republican 
nominees margin varied from four points in one survey to nine in 
another and 11 in a third 
a cbs news poll sunday and monday found bush pulling further 
ahead to a ninepoint lead after some weekend tightening a harris 
poll said dukakis had closed to within four also citing late 
tightening through the weekend it also said the movement had halted 
monday 
gallup found bush solidly ahead and holding steady 
pollsters attributed the differing figures to relatively high 
levels of voter dissatisfaction and indecision factors that 
increase the difficulty of determining who is likely to vote and 
make turnout a crucial element 
in gallups final preelection poll 20 percent were undecided or 
said they could change their minds easily enough to alter the 
outcome in the states including some big states where the election 
was close 
when the vote is soft like this the getoutthe vote efforts 
take on a lot more importance said gallup pollster larry hugick 
people dont feel about it strongly they can vote the way they 
say they can stay home or they can be urged by somebody to change 
their vote 
only about half of each candidates supporters in the gallup poll 
backed them strongly indicating the extent of voter dissatisfaction 
gallup gave bush an 11point lead among likely voters 53 percent 
to 42 percent when it apportioned the 5 percent who remained 
undecided by their background and ideology gallup arrived at a 
5644 percent estimate 
the harris poll done wednesday through monday put the race at 
5147 percent cbs had it at 5243 percent sunday and monday the 
same margin it found friday and saturday but up from its sixpoint 
spread saturday and sunday 
gallup however said it had found the race essentially stable 
with bush leading by 12 points on thursday and friday and by 11 on 
saturday and sunday its final estimate combined the results of the 
four days 
in addition to the difficulties of defining likely voters the 
differing results indicated the inherent imprecision of polling in 
the 1984 election one in which voter sentiment was considerably 
more solid final preelection polls gave president reagan leads 
ranging from 10 to 25 points he won by 18 
the new cbs poll found bush ahead in the south dukakis narrowly 
ahead in the northeast and the race close elsewhere gallup 
similarly found the race close in the east the industrial midwest 
and on the pacific coast 
the south is a big blowout for bush hugick said but 
theres a lot of states that dont look like the national race 
in an example of the possible effect of turnout gallup found 
bush leading by eight points among all registered voters compared 
with 11 points among the registered voters that it determined were 
likely to vote 
harris which consistently has had the race closer than most 
other polls had put it at 5045 as of sunday and 5046 as of 
monday an nbc newswall street journal poll sunday also found bush 
ahead by 5 points while other polls found bush leads of nine 10 
11 and 12 
the latest harris poll was conducted among 3216 likely voters 
the gallup poll among 2626 and the cbs poll among 1550 the 
harris and gallup polls had margins of error of plus or minus two 
percentage points cbs three points

military rescue teams and doctors today reached 
with food and medicine a remote mountainous southern region 
devastated by an earthquake that the government said killed more 
than 900 people 
the quake which registered 76 on the richter scale was chinas 
deadliest in 12 years it struck sunday in a thickly jungled area of 
yunnan province near the burmese border 
the national television news tonight broadcast the first pictures 
from the scene showing an aerial view of row upon row of collapsed 
houses in one village and victims being pulled from the wreckage 
most of the regions mud and wood homes are built on stilts 
because of its heavy rains and would have little chance of surviving 
a major quake 
the television report which said the quake affected a 
16000mile 14county area also showed army trucks loaded with 
troops moving into the area to help rescue work it did not say how 
many troops were deployed 
the ministry of civil affairs said 938 died in the quake said 
roy morey representative of the un development program the 
ministry told the british broadcasting corp and other reporters 
that 939 people had been killed 
morey said the ministry would not tell him how many people were 
injured or what were the immediate relief needs 
the quake was centered in yunnans heavily forested lancang and 
menglian counties about 240 miles southwest of the provincial 
capital of kunming the state seismology bureau said 40 aftershocks 
had hit the stricken subtropical area the strongest measuring 72 
nearly all the houses in lancang county population 400000 were 
destroyed morey quoted the civil affairs ministry as saying 
most homes in menglian county were also destroyed said a 
reporter with the official xinhua news agency in kunming 
the reporter who declined to be identified said rescue teams 
doctors food and supplies reached the stricken area and a 
delegation was on its way from beijing led by state councilor song 
jian a cabinet member without portfolio 
the reporter said the area had ample food and water supplies but 
its main road link to the outside world cut by quake damage was 
still under repair 
many of the casualties are believed to be from the lahu minority 
a tibetanburmese hill people who are mainly subsistence farmers and 
hunters they have their own language and are buddhists 
yunnan with a land area nearly as large as california has a 
population of more than 34 million lahus in the province number 
about 300000 
the death toll in sundays quake is chinas highest since july 
28 1976 when 242000 people were killed in the northeast china 
city of tangshan in the nations worst natural disaster in modern 
times 
that quake measured 78 on the richter scale 
the richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake 
with a reading of 70 ten times as powerful as a 60 which is also 
capable of inflicting heavy damage 
chinas last major quake was on aug 23 1985 when a 74 temblor 
killed 71 people and injured 125 in the far western xinjiang uygur 
autonomous region 
a quake measuring 50 occurred oct 15 in southern yunnan which 
is hit frequently by earth tremors but there were no reports of 
casualties 
seismologists said they did not know if the yunnan quakes were 
related to a powerful temblor that hit far western china on saturday 
that quake measuring 70 on the richter scale was centered in 
an uninhabited area of the tanggula mountains in western qinghai 
province and northern tibet officials in qinghai said they had no 
reports of casualties

illegal immigrants who took advantage of the governments amnesty 
program can now apply for permanent residency and the first 
applicants included a cowboy in texas a teenager in arizona and a 
laborer in illinois 
turnout at immigration offices was light monday but immigration 
and naturalization service officials expect about 15 million of the 
18 million nonagricultural amnesty recipients to eventually apply 
for permanent residency 
permanent residents receive a socalled green card theyve 
actually been white since 1976 which allows them to leave and 
enter the country at will and to eventually apply for citizenship 
its just exciting i guess getting something like this 
said shane oneil a 31yearold cowboy its liberty for me 
a native of yugoslavia oneil received his card after passing 
the required tests and and having his fingerprints taken at the el 
paso texas office he illegally entered the country when he jumped 
a ship in chicago 15 years ago 
with television cameras documenting the moment oneil calmly 
recited the colors of the us flag explained what the flags 13 
stripes symbolize told how many states are in the union identified 
ronald reagan as the president and defined the constitution as the 
supreme law of the land 
amnesty recipients who apply for permanent residency must either 
take a 60hour english and civics class from an inscertified school 
or pass an oral and written test similar to the citizenship test 
given to permanent residents who enter this country legally 
all have to pay an application fee of 80 a person or a maximum 
240 for a family they have a year to apply 
today marks the next step on the road to american citizenship 
for hundreds of thousands of legalized aliens and it is with great 
pleasure i accept your applications for permanent residency said 
harold ezell western regional commissioner of the ins in los 
angeles 
ezell accepted several applications at a morning news conference 
where he handed out buttons labeled 1994 your first vote a 
reminder of the first general election in which amnesty applicants 
can vote 
charlie troy spokesman for the new york district of the ins 
said scores of people mistakenly crowded the legalization office in 
manhattan but werent eligible yet to apply for their green cards 
in chicago alejandro garcia and his family received permanent 
residency on monday six days before his 40th birthday 
its early but its a great present said garcia a pallet 
loader from hammond ind we love the united states 
sergio molina 13 and his mother molly molina were the first 
applicants in phoenix mrs molina passed the required english and 
civics test sergio was exempt because of his age 
under the immigration reform and control act of 1986 people who 
had lived illegally in the united states since before jan 1 1982 
were allowed to apply for amnesty from deportation and were given 
temporary permission to work 
the yearlong program ended for most immigrants last may 4 though 
special agricultural workers have until nov 30 to apply 
those who waited until the last day to apply for amnesty have 
until nov 4 1990 to apply for permanent residency 
people who have completed 40 hours of an approved 60hour course 
dont have to take the test for permanent residency neither do 
agricultural workers who applied for amnesty under a separate 
program children under 16 adults 65 and older or people who are 
physically unable to take the course or test 
aliens can apply for citizenship after five years of permanent 
residency those who are married to us citizens can apply for 
citizenship after three years of permanent residency

former president chun doohwan is ready 
to surrender most of his wealth to buy peace from opponents demands 
for his arrest government party sources said today 
in the latest antichun protest eight students armed with 
homemade firebombs occupied a prosecutors office in central taejon 
city today to highlight calls for chuns arrest police arrested all 
the students within 30 minutes 
mr chun still thinks he has no illgotten wealth but he is 
willing to donate most of his assets if he is assured that it would 
quiet down the raging public protests said one of two party 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in return the democratic justice party source said chun wants 
assurances he will be left alone by investigators from opposition 
parties and those representing his friend and successor roh taewoo 
the second party source said that by giving up most of his 
wealth chun hopes to atone for major financial scandals in which 
some of his relatives have been implicated

diverting huge sums in stocks and land and sending much of it 
overseas to the united states and australia 
chun a former general who took power with military backing in 
1980 has denied involvement in any corruption 
the two party sources said chun has personal assets of 57 
million including a 14 million residence about twice as much as 
the amount he officially registered with authorities in 1983 
they attributed chuns greater wealth to increases in land prices 
during the past five years 
president roh in australia on an official visit reportedly 
asked the australian government to check if chun has any personal 
assets there 
last week thousands of people tried to march on chuns house to 
press for his arrest opponents are planning another march on chuns

a japan air lines boeing 747 came within a mile 
horizontally of a united airlines 737 shortly after both planes took 
off from ohare international airport and federal officials blamed 
a controller for the tight squeeze 
the mistake saturday was the 32nd error by a controller at ohare 
this year the federal aviation administration said 
the planes took off simultaneously from parallel runways the faa 
said monday because of low cloud cover that diminished visibility 
the controller should have staggered the takeoffs the faa said the 
controller also failed to give one of the planes order to turn in 
time to maintain adequate separation 
the controller was relieved from his position after the incident 
and given remedial retraining before being reinstated the faa said 
the jump in mistakes at ohare has come at a time of increasing 
air traffic at the airport the worlds busiest and rising concern 
over safety in october the faa produced a 100step plan calling 
for the addition of more controllers and installation of new 
equipment at ohare among other improvements

officials suspect an exhauststack leak was 
responsible for traces of plutonium found on 18 employees at the 
savannah river nuclear materials plant in recent weeks 
and in golden colo a federal inspector said several storage 
sites at the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant were becoming 
dangerously overcrowded greatly increasing the chance of an 
accident involving radioactive and hazardous wastes there 
at savannah river a du pont company spokesman said monday that 
workers in the laboratory from which the suspect exhaust comes 
analyze samples of nuclear materials produced by the plant 
including solutions that contain plutonium 
it was discovered oct 26 that the workers had plutonium traces 
on their hands and shoes 
there are a series of valves through which the plutonium may have 
entered the air from the 75foot stack air from those valves is now 
being sent through an extra sand filter said clif webb spokesman 
for du pont which operates the facility for the us department of 
energy 
the plant in aiken county sc near the georgia border 
produces plutonium and tritium for the nations nuclear weapons 
since april all three savannah river reactors have been shut 
down for maintenance amid questions of safety a number of 
nearaccidents and several releases of radioactive materials have 
been disclosed 
the search for the oct 26 leak concentrated during the weekend 
on the laboratory in the farea the plants chemical separations 
facility 
were continuing to investigate it webb said but we feel 
certain that that is the source point 
he said air leaving the room will now go through a sand filter 
before it is released into the outside air the air from the room 
already goes through two other filters 
contamination was found on the shoes of one other worker over the 
weekend webb said that made 18 employees who came in contact with 
the contamination since it was first discovered 
webb said the radiation exposure was about 1 microcurie in 
comparison an average smoke alarm gives off about 3 microcuries 
webb said 
were talking about a very low release no health threat to the 
employees or the public webb said 
in colorado officials from the state health department and us 
environmental protection agency found during a visit last week that 
five of 14 permitted storage areas are too crowded said nat miullo 
who oversees rocky flats for the epa 
the waste is being kept in steel crates and barrels 
increasingly crowded conditions are decreasing the facilitys 
ability to react in the event of an incident miullo said 
fred dowset who heads the health departments waste management 
unit declined comment on specifics of his inspection 
dowset acknowledged however that some storage areas were 
crowded and cited inadequate aisle space as one concern 
the chief cause of the crisis was a ban last month by idaho gov 
cecil andrus against all waste shipments the idaho national 
engineering laboratory near idaho falls has stored rocky flats waste 
for 20 years 
andrus ban was prompted by repeated delays in the opening of the 
waste isolation pilot plant a permanent disposal site near 
carlsbad new mexico the facility was supposed to begin accepting 
waste from idaho last month but political bickering and 
environmental concerns have pushed back its opening at least until 
early next year

nationwide have rendered decisions on their constitutionality of 
those 150 have said the guidelines are unconstitutional according 
to john steer general counsel for the united states sentencing

1 sentenced him to 302 days the appeals court ordered zeigler to 
resentence frank under the guidelines

israels supreme court today criticized the army 
for overcrowded conditions at the ketziot tent prison and for 
failing to expedite judicial review for 1500 detainees jailed there 
without trial 
but the threejudge panel rejected an appeal for release by 14 
detainees only five of whom are still held 
the court upheld the armys right to imprison palestinians from 
the occupied territories in israel despite geneva conventions 
against transferring prisoners across borders 
an army spokeswoman said 1558 inmates were under administrative 
detention in ketziot located in the negev desert near the egyptian 
border 
this was a decline from about 2700 detentions without trial at 
the peak of army sweeps during the palestinian uprising in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip more than 300 palestinians and 11 
israelis have died in the 11month uprising 
the army had no official reaction to the decision by the high 
court 
but one military official said the army was satisfied with the 
ruling for upholding the militarys right to jail palestinian 
detainees inside israel 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity also said 
overcrowding at ketzoit had been relieved since the judges visited 
the camp in the summer 
in a 45page ruling chief justice meir shamgar singled out 
israels system of administrative detentions or jailing 
palestinians suspected of antiisraeli activism for up to six months 
without trial 
negating freedom without the approval of a judicial authority 
is a drastic and serious step which the law allows only where 
there are essential and absolute security concerns shamgar wrote 
he said about 28 percent of administrative detentions have been 
overturned on appeal and urged the army to ensure appeals are heard 
within three weeks after jailing to avoid errors in judgment and 
fact whose significance mean violating a mans freedom without a 
reasonable basis 
his statement was seen as criticism of defense minister yitzhak 
rabin who revoked a regulation requiring military judges to review 
cases of administrative detention within 96 hours 
administrative detention has been criticized by the united states 
as a violation of due process 
in the ruling shamgar said he called overcrowding at ketziot the 
camps main problem 
when the justices toured the camp they found 28 prisoners jammed 
into some tents where the inmates were forced to sleep with no room 
for mattresses and personal belongings 
our impression is that overcrowding at ketziot camp must be 
resolved shamgar wrote 
the justices urged the army to reduce the number of prisoners in 
each tent they also said doctors should examine prisoners before 
incarceration 
shamgar found no justification for complaints of maltreatment at 
ketziot but noted complaints of violent treatment and 
humiliation of some prisoners while en route to the prison 
harming a man who is tied and helpless is a shameful and cruel 
act requires an appropriate response that matches the action said 
shamgar

for the seventh time in as many years 
manson family member patricia krenwinkel convicted in the sharon 
tatela bianca murders has been refused parole by the state board 
of prison terms 
this degree of barbaric violent behavior has no equal 
commissioner rudolph caspro said monday in announcing the boards 
decision 
throughout the twohour hearing ms krenwinkel 40 showed 
little emotion staring out an adjacent window 
ms krenwinkel who was convicted in seven of the charles manson 
cult slayings is eligible for parole in another year 
the board commended ms krenwinkel for good prison behavior but 
recommended individual therapy should it become available at the 
prison and urged her to develop a job skill 
a recent psychological evaluation found ms krenwinkel was no 
longer a threat to society but the board called the report 
inconclusive and said ms krenwinkel required more rehabilitation 
ms krenwinkels attorney wendy parks criticized the board for 
recommending individual counseling when it is unavailable at the 
prison 
before the hearing stephen kay the deputy district attorney who 
prosecuted the manson case said ms krenwinkel shows little remorse 
shes probably the most coldblooded murderess ive ever met in 
my 21 years in the das office this is a person without a heart 
and without a soul kay said she has no remorse her only 
remorse is that she got caught 
actress sharon tate 26 then eight months pregnant was found 
stabbed aug 9 1969 at the beverly hills home she shared with her 
movie director husband roman polanski four others with her were 
stabbed and shot 
a night later the bodies of wealthy grocer leno labianca and his 
wife rosemary were found in their los feliz home at both homes 
walls were smeared with bloody scrawlings 
at her trial ms krenwinkel testified that she stabbed one of 
the victims so many times that her hand throbbed afterward

only two people received free needles on the 
first day of a program for drug addicts that seeks to stem the 
spread of aids but an official declared the nations first 
government needle giveaway an enormous success 
dr stephen joseph the citys health commissioner said he 
anticipated a slow start for the experiment which calls for 
participation by 400 of the citys estimated 200000 drug addicts 
the experiment is an attempt to learn whether giving intravenous 
drug users clean needles will limit needlesharing among addicts 
aids can be spread through the use of contaminated needles and 
health officials say drug abusers are a major conveyor of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome to heterosexuals 
the program has drawn opposition from the citys top police 
official and some other black and hispanic leaders who say giving 
out needles encourages drug abuse 
its genocide pure and simple said city councilman hilton 
clark of harlem 
but joseph contended the black community is bearing the brunt of 
the aids crisis the lives that can be saved if this program works 
is the lives of black women and babies he said 
the two men who received needles and syringes monday had to find 
their way to a small unmarked room at the citys health department 
other sites had been planned but abandoned because of neighborhood 
complaints 
i think the enormous success of today is that the program got 
off the ground at all said joseph nobody stopped us from doing 
it 
the program is the first such governmentsponsored program in the 
nation although similar ones have operated in europe 
boston mayor raymond flynn had backed a proposal similar to the 
new york program but it was rejected by the boston city council 
earlier this year a pilot program in portland ore has been 
delayed until next month in tacoma wash a private individual has 
been distributing needles with help from the health department 
in new york needles will be given only to addicts at least age 
18 who have applied for drug treatment and been denied immediate 
admission to the citys overcrowded programs addicts also will 
receive counseling and help to get into a drug rehabilitation 
program 
in a speech to executives in manhattan on monday us surgeon 
general c everett koop endorsed the concept of needle exchanges 
although he said later he was unfamiliar with new yorks program 
he conditioned his support to programs limited to those who have 
not sought drug treatment new yorks does not have that restriction 
joseph proposed the program more than two years ago but state 
health officials were reluctant to approve it mayor edward i koch 
has backed the plan but it was opposed by police commissioner 
benjamin ward who is black and city councils black and hispanic 
caucus 
applicants fill out a consent form take a blood test and receive 
a kit containing a condom sterile water cotton a lubricant and 
pamphlets about safe sex and needle hygiene 
any addict who tries to get a new needle without returning the 
old one will be expelled from the program joseph said researchers 
will test blood from the used needles to see if they are being 
shared 
while in the program addicts will be immune from prosecution for 
having the syringes the sale of unprescribed needles is legal in 38 
states but not in new york

unusually cool and rainy summer weather has caused 
severe damage to japans rice and vegetable crops boosting food 
prices and requiring government aid to farmers agriculture 
officials reported today 
the ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries estimated 
crop damage at 292 billion the highest loss since a record 555 
billion in damage was reported in 1980 
the government will grant lowinterest loans to farmers hard hit 
by crop losses said toshio yamada an official of the association 
of agricultural cooperatives 
in the tokyo area prices of 14 vegetables jumped 50 percent in 
october over a year ago according to the yomiuri shimbun newspaper 
in northeastern japan where 91 percent of the crop losses 
occurred 1630000 acres of crops out of a total 2425540 acres 
were damaged by low temperatures and heavy rains the ministry said 
it said 61 percent of the damage or 179 billion affected rice 
crops damage was so severe that some farmers were unable to grow 
enough rice even for their own needs yamada said 
japans rice harvest this year is expected to total 991 million 
metric tons down from 107 million metric tons in 1987 
but rice prices which are set by the government and subsidized 
under japans food control system will not be affected ministry 
officials said 
japans rice stockpiles of about 2 million tons likely will make 
it unnecessary to import the staple to meet the 300000ton to 
400000ton shortfall ministry officials said

sacrificial lamb of the legal system as he was executed in the 
electric chair for murdering a hitchhiker 13 years ago in a robbery 
that netted 12 and a watch 
jeffrey joseph daugherty 33 was executed monday for the death 
of one of four women he was convicted of killing during a threeweek 
crime spree in two states 
he was the nations second person executed in five days and 103rd

told fellow death row inmates to keep their hope alive 
i hope with all my heart i will be the last sacrificial lamb of 
a system that is not just and all these people know it is not 
just daugherty said the executions serve no purpose

against halting it 
a small group of demonstrators opposing capital punishment 
including actress margot kidder and a group supporting executions

nervous as he voted today in his adopted home state of texas where 
he ended his presidential campaign telling voters the election is a 
referendum on a philosophy a way of life 
the vice president and his wife barbara voted in a hotel 
conference room which had been set up as a polling place the couple 
then visited a local republican headquarters to talk to people 
working to get out the vote 
emerging from the voting booth bush was asked how he felt 
nervous everytime i vote here i feel nervous he said 
asked about the outcome he replied no predictions 
at the gop headquarters bush personally made a halfdozen 
telephone calls no im not kidding he told one person who 
apparently expressed skepticism that bush was on the line having 
done all the hard work now the key is to get the vote out he 
said 
the vice president also showed off his french to a reporter from 
france je peux parler un peu de francais he said explaining 
he could speak the language a little he added he felt tres 
heureux aujourdhui or very happy today 
bush told reporters he was very glad the campaign was over 
he planned a relaxed family day with a lot of exercise he 
planned to watch election returns on television with family members 
and friends at his home in a houston condominiumhotel complex 
bush wrapped up his campaign monday with a final swing through 
michigan ohio and missouri he attended a raucus rally monday 
evening at the galleria shopping mall where country stars loretta 
lynn crystal gayle and mo bandy entertained several thousand fans 
todays election is more than just a referendum on peace and 
prosperity bush told the crowd 
its a referendum on a philosophy a way of life thats well 
and alive right here deep in the heart of texas he said 
in a halfhour paid tv advertisment monday night the republican 
presidential nominee summed up the themes of his campaign and said 
rival michael dukakis has no experience in national security 
affairs 
i dont believe we can take a risk on an issue as important as 
our national security he said on the ad broadcast on the three 
major networks right after dukakis aired a halfhour spot of his own 
later a softspeaking bush talked to viewers for a few minutes 
at the end of the halfhour commercial that featured biographical 
and campaign scenes set to music and narration as well as an 
endorsement by president reagan and various bush family members 
i respect my opponent i admire his devotion to family and i 
appreciate his decision to enter public service bush said but 
i do believe we are guided by fundamentally different philosophies 
a great divide an honest difference of opinion on which approach 
will lead america in the 90s stronger and more secure than ever 
bush also echoed president reagans 1980 campaign line by saying 
if you elect me president you will be better off four years from 
now than you are today 
the ad made no mention of bushs running mate sen dan quayle of 
indiana whose qualifications have been an issue in the campaign 
bush appeared in a jovial mood monday as nationwide polls showed 
him holding his lead over dukakis 
accompanied by his top campaign advisers bush spent the final 
campaign day addressing rallies in a suburb of detroit in rural 
ashland ohio and in st louis 
while calling on voters to reject the failed liberal policies 
of the past bush also seemed in a reflective mood as he talked 
about what the campaign meant to him and what he sees ahead 
sometimes theres ups he said sometimes theres downs 
sometimes you get written off by all the great experts and sometimes 
you bounce back 
but ill tell you where you get your strength you get your 
strength from travelling around the united states of america and 
meeting and visiting with and listening to the heartbeat that comes 
from the american people themselves 
bush said he was confident that the negativism of the campaign 
would soon be behind him 
what i will do is trust the good judgment of the american 
people who immediately shift gears and start looking to the 
future he said in an interview with radio reporters

james chandler whose name is on the ballot 
today for reelection as a state representative has been asking 
people not to vote for him 
chandler is serving his third term in new hampshires house and 
the concord republican initially decided to seek reelection but 
when house clerk carl peterson announced his retirement chandler 
decided hed rather have that job a fulltime post he held 
previously 
the only hitch was that petersons announcement came too late for 
chandler to drop his name from the ballot 
so chandler 57 has taken down his signs run no ads and 
encouraged people not to vote for him his is one of 10 names on the 
ballot for five atlarge seats from concord 
state representatives will elect petersons successor in 
december and chandler knows he could lose his house seat and still 
not get the clerks job back 
but its not fair to hedge your bets he said if he became 
clerk and left the house it would cost concord the price of a 
special election

fearful that one of the longest ballots in 
state history would create long lines at the ballot booth hundreds 
of san francisco voters crowded the registrar of voters office to 
request lastminute absentee ballots 
about 25 percent or 93000 of the citys voters requested 
absentee ballots according to acting registrar germaine wong who 
said monday that she expects about 75 percent of those to be 
returned 
a record number of voters are resorting to absentee ballots to 
avoid the crunch at polling places today the field institute said 
the phenomenon may mean that some results of some close races may 
not be known for days and possibly weeks after election day 
absentee ballots take longer to process because the signatures 
often must be verified by hand 
a steady stream of voters poured out of the registrars office 
monday and snaked through the rotunda of city hall confident that 
they would save time in the long run 
but with the counter finally in view after a 45minute wait 
david bartholomew 33 was having second thoughts 
i think now ive learned my lesson and next year ill send in

a 66 million lawsuit has been filed charging that 
a law firm and its major client shell oil co conspired to cover 
up years of pollution at the rocky mountain arsenal 
travelers insurance co which insured shells arsenal operations 
from 1952 to 1975 charged that the oil giant failed for decades to 
tell underwriters about environmental destruction at the chemical 
production site north of stapleton international airport 
the complex lawsuit filed nov 1 in california is unusual in 
its accusation that the denver law firm holme roberts conspired with 
a client 
the army which leased arsenal space to shell sued the oil giant 
in december 1983 to force it to join the 2 billion cleanup of the 
27squaremile facility shell hired holme roberts as its attorneys 
in the case 
one month later travelers agreed to pay 55 percent 16 million 
of shells costs of defending itself against that suit 
travelers is asking for return of the 16 million plus 50 
million in punitive damages 
travelers said shell knowingly and intentionally released 
pollutants into the environment since commencement of its operations 
at the arsenal in 1952 it also charged that holme roberts learned 
of the extent of shells pollution at the arsenal while representing 
shell 
a spokesman for holme roberts said the lawsuit was totally 
without foundation and a shell corporate spokeswoman said the 
accusations were totally without merit 
in a separate case shell is suing travelers and 250 other 
insurance companies to force them to share the entire cost of the 
cleanup bill that trial is in its second year in san mateo county 
calif superior court 
travelers charged in its lawsuit that shell and holme roberts are

underdog michael dukakis ended his marathon run for 
the presidency today with a crosscountry journey home predicting 
that hed surprise the pollsters with an upset victory over 
republican george bush 
arriving sleepless from a nightlong flight from california that 
included stops in iowa and michigan the democratic nominee was 
publicly optimistic as he cast his ballot at a hometown housing 
project 
i voted for mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen and im proud of 
it he said leaving the polling booth with his wife kitty and 
their three children his mother euterpe dukakis raised her hand 
in a v for victory sign 
at a boston airport welcomehome rally dukakis told his audience 
to expect the unexpected 
i think tonight were not only going to surprise a few people 
but were going to be doing the celebrating dukakis told several 
hundred cheering supporters its been an incredible experience 
he was equally feisty at a rainswept rally at the detroit 
airport his last stop before boston 
we always knew this would be a tough competitive race he 
said democrats win tough competitive races lets go out 
there and make sure that were the ones who are popping the 
champagne corks and preparing for a new era of american greatness 
earlier about 3000 partisans braved subfreezing temperatures 
to greet dukakis before dawn in des moines iowa in the state where 
the massachusetts governor began his bid for the white house 20 
months ago 
there is so much we can do working together just so long as we 
remember that we are one nation one community one people he 
told them 
the rallies were part of a grueling virtually nonstop schedule 
dukakis has kept up since the weekend in his uphill bid to defeat 
bush 
i come away from all of this even more optimistic about the 
future of this great country of ours than when i started he told 
supporters before flying to detroit and then home to boston 
dukakis began the campaigns last trip back across the country 
after spending a final day in california 
dont let them tell you this campaign is over dukakis said 
monday night in a speech to more than 10000 supporters in los 
angeles before heading home it wont be over until the people of 
california have their say i know this race is within our grasp 
both here and across this country 
dukakis told his california audience they may hear news reports 
calling the race in bushs favor based on exit polls in eastern 
states but he urged them to work until polls close in the west 
its yours and the hands across america that will win this 
election for us dukakis said 
he also took another swipe at bushs selection of indiana sen 
dan quayle as his running mate by noting that the gop nominee did 
not mention quayle during a halfhour network commercial broadcast 
on election eve 
ive heard of the secret ballot this is the first time ive 
heard of the secret candidate dukakis told the starstudded rally 
that included performers ted danson chevy chase kris 
kristofferson stephen stills lloyd bridges sally field hal 
linden and rob lowe 
the trip home which began in california and includes stops in 
iowa and michigan will end a 8500mile nonstop campaign journey 
that began saturday in colorado and that by its end will bring 
dukakis to 11 cities in nine states 
in that time dukakis traveled from the west coast to the midwest 
back west and then across the country one last time on the way home 
to cast his ballot late this morning in brookline mass and await 
the results 
polls have shown dukakis closing on bush but still trailing the 
vice president particularly in the electoral college count which 
heavily favors the vice president 
but the massachusetts governor and aides remained upbeat to the 
end of the race the selfdescribed marathon dukakis began some 20 
months ago as a virtual unknown campaigning in snowy iowa 
were here tonight but tomorrow were going to slam dunk bush 
and quayle dukakis told a boisterous rally at pauley pavilion 
the storied basketball arena at ucla 
the race is closer and its getting closer every hour the 
massachusetts governor said 
dukakis traveled overnight sunday to campaign monday morning in 
ohio and missouri and then flew back to the west coast for rallies 
in san francisco and los angeles before heading back east 
in san francisco he spoke to about 30000 people pausing for 
several minutes at the end of his speech as he did later in los 
angeles to enjoy the cheers 
pauley pavilion at ucla was the scene of the second and final 
debate between bush and dukakis a contest in which dukakis was 
widely perceived as the loser in a battle he so much needed to win 
i think california is going to lock george bush right out of 
the white house he told the outdoor rally in san francisco and 
the indoor event in los angeles 
dukakis long shot strategy is dependent on the race coming down 
to california and its 47 electoral votes the largest election day 
prize 
as the race closed dukakis did something he did few times during 
the lengthy campaign discuss his vision of america 
america is not just a place he said in a solemn tone its 
not just a piece of land or just another country its the noblest 
experiment ever undertaken on this planet its a symbol of what we 
human beings can do when we unleash the will of our people our 
nation and our country

a federal judge says he imposed relatively short 
sentences on an iranian father and son for trying to smuggle missile 
parts to their homeland because of the fathers age and poor health 
and the sons stupidity 
the united states has prosecuted at least 46 cases of arms 
smuggling or attempted arms smuggling to iran since 1981 when the 
countrys 8year war with neighboring iraq began 
ahmad modarressi 64 was sentenced monday to 14 months in prison 
and his son majid 30 to six months in prison by us district 
judge mark l wolf 
the judge said mitigating factors included the elder modarressis 
belief that the us government was interested in improving 
relations with iran 
but wolf characterized the younger modarressi as extremely 
naive perhaps more accurately described as extremely stupid 
the circumstances do tend to diminish the moral culpability of 
the defendant though not his legal culpability wolf said the 
preconceived notion of the type of person who would engage in 
international arms smuggling fits a certain profile this profile 
had very little to do with majid modarressi 
the defendant majid modarressis stupid behavior in this case 
reached a level ive never encountered in criminal matters by the 
end of the case he seems more like a cartoon character than a 
menace to society 
among the sons gaffes wolf said were suggesting a 60 million 
illegal deal over the telephone to an unknown raytheon co worker 
not knowing what a tow antitank missile was and inquiring about 
stinger antiaircraft missiles simply because he had heard them 
mentioned in a tv news report about afghanistan 
wolf said the elder modarressi had a fuzzy understanding of the 
irancontra scandal and the trip to tehran reportedly made by former 
national security adviser robert mcfarlane 
i am influenced by the fact that he apparently had the honest 
belief that while export of these arms was illegal the united 
states wanted to sell these arms to iran to open channels for 
exports to that country the judge said 
ahmad modarressis sentence includes 10 months he has already 
served he is an iranian national and could be deported after his 
release 
majid modarressis sentence is 189 days the amount of time he 
has already served he will be required to perform 500 hours of 
community service in cincinnati where he has been an unemployed 
architect and has an american wife and 4yearold daughter 
the father and son were accused of violating the us arms export 
control act by attempting to buy microwave tubes for the radar of 
the hawk antiaircraft missile system and sell them to iran 
the elder modarressi pleaded guilty during their trial and his 
son was convicted oct 26 after a 19day trial 
the case stemmed from a 10month investigation in which a customs 
service agent posed as an employee of raytheon the lexingtonbased 
firm that makes the hawk system and recorded conversations with the 
modarressis 
although a truce in the iraniraq war was announced aug 20 us 
officials said iran has maintained its effort to obtain spare parts 
for its military hardware the bulk of which was bought from the 
united states by the americanbacked government of the shah before 
the 1979 islamic revolution

republican sen dan quayle saying 
well we got one sure vote cast his ballot today in his 
hometown where he ended his occasionally rocky campaign for the vice 
presidency 
returning to indiana monday night quayle told about 2000 
supporters nearby fort wayne that he was finally at home after a 
campaign that began when he was picked for the no 2 slot at the 
republican convention in august 
well we got one sure vote quayle said as he emerged from 
the huntington county courthouse where he and his wife marilyn 
voted 
two said mrs quayle adding it was a very exciting day 
for the couple 
before voting quayle went to the family dentist for a routine 
checkup and teethcleaning aides said the visit to the dentist has 
been an election day ritual since quayle was elected to the house of 
representatives in 1976 
as he walked from the dentist to the courthouse elementary 
school children cheered quayle who was raised in the town 
huntington also was the scene of one of quayles most trying 
campaign moments a tensionfilled confrontation with reporters who 
questioned him about his past the day after he accepted the vice 
presidential nomination 
at the rally monday night quayle did not mention accusations 
that he had used family influence to get a slot in the indiana 
national guard to avoid the draft during the vietnam war 
but he said there have been weeks of wild exhilaration along 
with personal testing and we knew you were there 
quayle seeking to become the first indiana native to become vice 
president since thomas r marshall served under president woodrow 
wilson from 19131921 was praised by several state party figures as 
a political survivor 
you have been subjected to the whitehot test of politics and 
the national press and you stood the test said rep dan coates 
rind 
the rally took on the look of a political convention with a huge 
wooden replica of the american flag used as a backdrop a videotaped 
narrative about quayle and a series of speeches by gubernatorial 
candidate john mutz and his running mate steve goldsmith 
fellow hoosiers ive been in 38 states and made more than 235 
stops quayle said for the last 10 weeks ive felt like ive 
been strapped to the back of an indy 500 car but now i can see the 
checkered flag and with your help my friends george bush and i 
will be seeing you in the winners circle 
quayle accompanied by his wife and his three children tucker 
14 benjamin 12 and corinne 9 dined with his mother and father 
james and corinne and spent the night at their home 
the senator also scheduled a visit today with martha pulliam his 
97yearold grandmother at the methodist nursing home in 
indianapolis before returning to washington to await tonights 
election returns 
quayle had been besieged by questions from news organizations 
about the circumstances surrounding his enlistment in the indiana 
national guard at the height of the vietnam war in 1969 and the 
question of whether he benefited by undue influence in getting 
admitted into the indiana university law school with a c average 
on undergraduate work at depauw university 
quayle has said that his campaign went much more smoothly once 
the questions were laid aside 
campaigning earlier monday in roanoke va quayle said americans 
must say good night to democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis if they want to savethe changes wrought during president 
reagans eight years in office 
during a rally at an aiport hangar in roanoke nestled in the 
blue ridge mountains he declared let me say to the citizens of 
virginia michael dukakis is not on your side 
the senator said he was cautiously optimistic about the gops 
election prospects and said he was satisfied with the way he handled 
his role as bushs running mate

a swarm of killer bees also known as 
africanized bees was found last week on a ship docked in tampa the 
chief of the florida department of agricultures apiary inspection 
bureau says 
the swarm found oct 31 was destroyed by us department of 
agriculture personnel and samples were sent to a laboratory where 
they were identified as africanized bees laurence cutts said monday 
it was the fourth colony of killer bees found on a ship in a 
florida port in the past two years cutts said 
another swarm of bees was found last week on a crane next to a 
ship at fort lauderdale but officials believe those were european 
bees the type used in this country to make honey 
killer bees descendants of african bees which escaped from a 
research project in brazil in 1956 are extremely belligerent 
although their stings are no more potent that other bees they 
attack in numbers instead of singly and have caused a number of 
deaths in south america 
cutts does not expect the killer bees to become established in 
florida by entrance through ports 
if one swarm escaped detection at a port and entered the state 
it would become genetically diluted with other strains however he 
said if two swarms were in the same area they could begin breeding 
and spread throughout the state 
therefore it is desirable that we destroy all africanized bees 
brought in he said 
he said finding the bees on ships from central and south america 
is going to be more and more a common occurrence 
the bees have been slowly migrating northward since their 1956 
escape and have reached the southern part of mexico they are 
expected to reach texas by 1990 but are not expected to reach 
florida for three to five more years cutts said

workers at two gdansk shipyards went on 
strike today to demand that the government drop plans to close the 
lenin shipyard solidarity leader lech walesa called the strikes a 
warning to the authorities 
walesa said the strikes defied his banned trade federation and 
prove he is losing control of polands restive workers he called 
for moderation and indicated he might be willing to conduct talks 
with authorities even before the shipyard question is resolved 
his statement appeared to be a retreat from his earlier demand 
that the lenin shipyard closure be suspended before the talks begin 
speaking to reporters after strikes began at two smaller gdansk 
shipyards walesa said he had urged the workers not to strike but 
they defied him 
this situation indicates that lech walesa and his group are 
losing control it is a warning for myself and a warning to the 
authorities he said 
i dont want to go on strike i want to settle the problems of 
the round table and the solidarity trade union not to get the 
country deeper into crisis walesa said 
the government said the nations largest shipyard the birthplace 
of solidarity will be closed in december because it is losing 
money solidarity said the closure is a politically motivated 
attempt to cripple the movement 
some workers at the wisla shipyard and the repair shipyard today 
declared strikes in a show of unity to demand preservation of the 
lenin yard earlier walesa led more than 6000 workers in a rally 
at the lenin yard opposing the government closure order 
wisla shipyard management would not confirm any work stoppage 
but reporters saw banners at the yard and were told by strike 
committee leader jan stanecki that nearly half the 1000 employees 
were refusing to work 
walesa said about 500 workers were striking at repair shipyard 
he also stopped short of proclaiming a nationwide strike 
alert which he had threatened sunday 
in addition to demanding preservation of the lenin shipyard the 
workers who went on strike today called for the rehiring of those 
fired for striking in august they also called for reinstatement of 
solidarity which was created in august 1980 and banned after a 
december 1981 military crackdown 
after todays rally at the lenin shipyard walesa said the 
lenin shipyard is not going on strike for the time being we are not 
even announcing an alert we are just waiting for reaction all over 
the country we are ready to execute any maneuver at any moment 
on sunday he threatened to order a nationwide strike alert 
at todays rally instead workers approved a resolution urging a 
struggle to preserve the cradle of reforms and cradle of 
solidarity walesa said 
the staterun news media has accused walesa of blocking the start 
of talks on the countrys future communist authorities agreed to 
the talks in exchange for walesas helping end polands most serious 
labor unrest in seven years 
as a condition for solidaritys participation in the talks 
walesa has demanded the scuttling of plans to close the shipyard and 
the rehiring of workers fired because of the august strikes 
polands inflation rate is running about 60 percent and workers 
have demanded wage increases to protect their buying power the 
country also faces a foreign debt of more than 39 billion

foreign minister tariq aziz of iraq today said his 
country was willing to begin repatriating sick and wounded prisoners 
from its 8yearold war with iran if iran agrees to do the same 
his statement seemed to clear the way for a prisoner exchange 
following irans earlier offer to release all sick and wounded 
prisoners as well as civilian detainees on a reciprocal basis 
aziz speaking to reporters after a meeting with officials of the 
international committee of the red cross said the repatriation 
would apply to 411 iranians and 1115 iraqis who have been 
identified by the red cross 
a red cross spokeswoman francoise derron confirmed that number 
had been registered but said since we have not been able to visit 
all pows we may assume there are more ill and injured prisoners 
the red cross has registered a total of 50182 iraqi prisoners in 
iran and 19284 iranians in iraq the red cross has estimated the 
number of additional unregistered prisoners is 20000 to 30000 on 
each side 
the standard red cross practice is to register and interview 
every prisoner to make sure his repatriation is voluntary 
irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati already has offered 
to release all sick and wounded prisoners as well as civilian 
detainees on a reciprocal basis 
aziz said the repatriation should be begun by each side at the 
same time 
aziz said iraq wanted an immediate repatriation of sick and 
wounded prisoners to put an end to their suffering and their 
families anxiety after the cessation of active hostilities and to 
comply with the geneva convention governing pows 
he said it should not be taken by iran as a pretext to block 
the comprehensive exchange operation in accordance with the geneva 
convention as more than 100000 pows from both sides still suffer 
from captivity despite a ceasefire that began aug 20 
the red cross has offered to oversee an exchange of prisoners 
the question of a prisoner exchange has been a problem in the 
unmediated peace talks the talks are aimed at consolidating the 
ceasefire and peace in the region 
iraq has called for an immediate exchange of all prisoners 
independent of the peace talks iraq has said it would release its 
more than 30000 prisoners right away if iran would reciprocate 
but iran has linked a fullscale prisoner exchange to agreement 
on a withdrawal of troops saying this would be under the terms of 
the un security councils ceasefire resolution 598 
last week aziz charged that iran was delaying a prisoner 
exchange velayati accused iraq of using humanitarian issues as a 
pretext for delaying withdrawal of its troops from iranian territory 
in an interview monday with irans official islamic republic news 
agency velayati claimed no iranian troops were left on iraq 
territory but said iraqi forces were occupying more than 386 square 
miles of iranian territory

japanese automakers have located their 
us plants in areas with few blacks but they are not alone in the 
practice according to a new study 
industrial development specialists in state governments report 
that they are often asked by american firms in a variety of 
industries to eliminate from consideration plant sites in counties 
with 30 percent or more black population said the study to be 
published in the next issue of the university of 
californiaberkeleys california management review 
the 18month study by university of michigan professors robert e 
cole and donald r deskins jr used 1987 and 1988 industry 
employment figures their calculations are based on the distance 
deemed by the us census bureau as a reasonable commute 29 miles 
if you look at most of these new plant ventures they all seem 
to be between 20 and 30 miles away from a black cluster deskins 
said in an interview published in tuesdays editions of the san 
francisco examiner 
japanese companies he said seem to be working just within the 
letter but not the spirit of the law 
the study found that the highest percentages of black employees 
were at traditional big three auto plants those that have 
neither renovated nor been rebuilt since 1980 and are in the 
greatest danger of closing 
new general motors plants have hired a work force that is 254 
percent black drawing from a population near the new plants that is 
166 percent black the study said ford and chrysler have not built 
us plants since 1980 
the nummi plant in fremont a joint venture between general 
motors and toyota has a greater percentage of black 28 percent 
and hispanic 23 percent employees than the surrounding area the 
study found 
the authors contend that is evidence of the opportunity provided 
to minorities by the auto industry and the united auto workers 
insistence that laidoff gm workers be the first hired as a 
condition of the joint venture

residents of nantucket and marthas vineyard split 
over limiting the tourism that supports their economies squared off 
at a public hearing over the rejection of a direct ferry link 
between boston and the resort islands 
i live on marthas vineyard i consider it a special place but 
that doesnt make me a special person sherman goldstein who owns 
the tisbury inn said monday of the move widely viewed as an attempt 
to limit tourist traffic 
at a daylong statehouse hearing the joint transportation 
committee heard comment on a bill introduced by state sen william 
q maclean jr that would strip the woods hole marthas vineyard 
and nantucket steamship authority of some licensing powers 
maclean who owns a house on nantucket filed the proposed 
legislation after the threemember authority board rejected oct 20 
a private catamaran service to the islands that carried 11500 
passengers between boston and marthas vineyard on a trial basis 
last summer 
opponents of the highspeed line sought by bay stateprovincetown 
cruises said it would add to crowds and development problems on the 
islands off southern cape cod defenders said direct access would 
alleviate mammoth summer traffic problems on the cape 
our streets are jammed steamship authority chairman bernard 
grossman of nantucket said downtown nantucket in the three summer 
months is like filenes basement department store between 
thanksgiving and christmas 
maclean initially sought to strip the authority of its right 
granted by legislation in 1960 to license private ferry service 
between the mainland and two islands 
but under an amendment added monday the bill would limit boat 
sizes to from 300 to 500 passengers and would limit service to two 
round trips daily on the boston runs 
the lively hearing prompted charges of elitism on nantucket 
reports of a movement afoot to issue passports for yearround 
vineyard residents and grossmans claim that many nantucket tourists 
arrive with 5 and a dirty shirt and dont change either 
the board of selectmen wants to revoke my citizenship there 
maclean who has come under fire from some nantucket residents for 
proposing the legislation said to some boos maybe ill give it 
back to them im not an elitist 
joseph g pallotta jr who heads bay stateprovincetown cruises 
said the vineyard spray carried 11500 passengers from julyoctober 
less than 2 percent of the 2 million steamship authority passengers 
he defended service on grounds that the 300passenger catamaran 
carried no cars motorcycles or mopeds 
the boat keeps thousands of cars off the cape highways he

at the ceremony attended by 15000 believers and issued strong 
demands for more priests religious education and bishops to fill 
czechoslovakias nine empty sees 
negotiations between the vatican and the czechoslovak government 
have always been thorny due to pragues unwillingness to approve 
clergymen proposed by the vatican to become bishops 
apart from sokol who is in his mid50s all the incumbents are 
over 75 
earlier this year about 600000 people signed a petition calling 
for religious freedom and the appointment of new bishops

soviet human rights activist andrei sakharov 
entered massachusetts general hospital this morning for tests to 
determine whether he needs a pacemaker a spokesman for the nobel 
laureate said 
if doctors find he does need it sakharov will return to boston 
later this month for the operation and may extend his twoweek visit 
to the united states said spokesman matthew bannisterimplanting 
the device which regulates the hearts rhythm usually requires a 
twoday hospital stay 
sakharov is believed to have suffered a minor stroke several 
years ago while being forcefed by soviet authorities during a 
hunger strike his wife physician yelena bonnner said in a letter 
to her children in june 1985 that he showed minor parkinsonian 
symptoms such as trembling hands afterward but appeared to have 
recovered otherwise 
sakharov making his first visit to the west said at a news 
conference monday that his health has been stable recently 
commenting on changes in his homeland sakharov warned that 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs reforms face a domestic backlash 
but dismissed the personal risks of continuing his outspokenness 
if perestroika does not succeed then the question of my return 
to exile in gorky is totally insignificant sakharov said 
through a translator gorbachev released sakharov from internal 
exile nearly two years ago 
perestroika the restructuring of the soviet economic and 
political system is at a very critical phase the 67yearold 
nobel peace prize winner told reporters during a twohour news 
conference 
he said there are sharp debates in the press and at all 
levels over political and economic issues the fate is being 
decided of which direction our development will go said sakharov 
the west must not fear perestroika a greater danger to the 
world as a whole would be the failure of perestroika he said 
warning that failure could strengthen his countrys 
militaryindustrial complex and result in an expansionist foreign 
policy 
sakharov said arms control negotiations between the soviet union 
and the united states are at a critical juncture with both sides 
considering 50 percent cuts in their strategic arsenals it is an 
extraordinary opportunity he said 
monday was sakharovs first full day outside the soviet union he 
arrived sunday night from moscow to begin his twoweek trip to the 
west by visiting relatives in the boston area his wife remained in 
moscow 
on thursday night sakharov flies to washington to take part in a 
board meeting of the international foundation for the survival and 
development of humanity 
sakharov has accepted an invitation to meet president reagan at 
the white house on nov 14 presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
told reporters aboard air force one as reagan returned to washington 
from california on monday night 
sakharovs news conference was held to promote the foundation 
which was organized in january by us and soviet scientists 
yevgeny p velikhov foundation chairman and vice president of 
the soviet academy of sciences said the organization has begun work 
on nuclear weapons verification and environmental protection and 
hopes to sponsor an exchange visit of 2000 children between the 
soviet union and the united states next year 
sakharov a physicist who helped his country develop the hydrogen 
bomb in the 1950s won the nobel peace prize in 1975 for his fight 
for human rights in january 1980 he was banished to gorky an 
industrial city about 250 miles from moscow that is closed to 
foreigners for opposing the soviet invasion of afghanistan in 
december 1986 gorbachev allowed him back to moscow 
sakharov declined to comment on todays us election but said 
he respects the united states for its democracy work ethic 
dynamism selfcriticism and generosity 
the phrase you often hear in the us is can i help you 
he said that is something you hear mainly on the street or in 
stores but it also appears in us behavior on the international 
stage 
in contrast sakharov portrayed the political climate in his 
homeland as contentious and uncertain 
he said five prisoners of conscience who were convicted of 
antisoviet agitation and propaganda have been released in recent 
days but he listed eight others who remain in prison camps or exile 
he called perestroika a genuine real process but said a 
crackdown on demonstrations including the violent breakup of a 
meeting in minsk on oct 30 gave him very great anxiety over 
the course of the reforms 
this is extremely dangerous and could destroy perestroika and 
turn it around he said 
asked to explain these seeming contradictions sakharov said i 
think it was not my words that were contradictory but the situation 
itself i have purposefully accented the positive and negative 
elements so that this contradiction would be clear

the supreme court on tuesday upheld the 
authority of the states to tax corporate income derived from sales 
of oil and natural gas extracted from offshore wells under federal 
jurisdiction 
by a 90 vote the court approved a tax method in iowa that is 
virtually identical to that used by most other states 
the socalled unitary method challenged unsuccessfully by shell 
oil co allows a state to impose a tax on that portion of a 
companys income calculated to come from the amount of business it 
does within that state 
shell oil argued that all its income from sales of outer 
continental shelf oil and gas should be excluded from the formula 
but justice thurgood marshall in his opinion for the court said 
the iowa tax does not violate a 1953 federal law authorizing 
exploration and production of outer continental shelf oil and gas 
we reject shells argument that congress intended to 
prohibit the inclusion in a constitutionally permissible 
apportionment formula of income from outer continental shelf oil 
and gas marshall said 
he said the federal law only prohibits a state adjacent to such 
offshore land from taxing that land directly 
marshall said nothing in the law bans a state adjacent to the 
offshore land or located inland from basing a tax on a companys 
total income including a portion from the sale of outer continental 
shelf oil and gas 
the extent of revenue nationwide that is at stake in the case is 
unclear 
iowa sought an additional 243000 from shell oil for a sixyear 
period 
the outer continental shelf is underwater land more than three 
miles off the shore of any state the land is owned by the federal 
government and leased to private companies 
tuesdays ruling upheld a 1987 decision by the iowa supreme court 
that was supported by the reagan administration 
the justice department said the iowa case presented a good 
opportunity for the high court to resolve the dispute over a states 
authority to tax a multistate activity

goes4 a weather satellite launched eight 
years ago was sent into a high retirement orbit tuesday taking the 
craft out of the busy space highway used by most working 
communications and weather satellites 
lou barbieri chief of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administrations satellite operations center said goes4 had 
reached the end of its useful life and was put into a higher orbit 
to get it out of the way 
goes4 had spent its working life at 22300 miles above the 
earth the busiest altitude for satellites at this height 
satellites take 24 hours to orbit the earth and appear to be 
stationary at one point above the globe 
over a threeweek period noaa satellite controllers commanded 
the goes4 to make six rocket firings that slowly raised the crafts 
orbit by 62 miles barbieri said the increased altitude will add one 
minute per day to the satellites orbit period and cause it to 
slowly drift westward 
goes4 which cost 45 million and was expected to last only 2 to 
5 years was launched in september 1980 it initially was stationed 
over the pacific ocean and used infrared and visible light 
instruments to capture images of weather patterns and storm 
formations over the western united states noaa said the satellite 
warned of the approach of hurricane iwa which struck hawaii in 
november 1982 and caused an estimated 350 million in damage 
in 1984 goes4 was loaned to the european space agency to serve 
as a weather data relay station barbieri said the craft was moved 
to a point over the western atlantic to help the europeans recover 
from a satellite failure 
barbieri said a malfunction of a primary imaging system and 
depletion of on board fuel forced noaa to retire goes4 he said the 
agency sent two earlier satellites to even higher orbits but goes4 
only had enough fuel to edge up another 62 miles 
retirement of goes4 leaves noaa with six working satellites but 
two of these goes2 and goes3 are used only as communication 
relays barbieri said

george bush and michael dukakis joined millions of other 
americans at the polls today at the end of their long presidential 
campaign bush said i feel nervous though preelection surveys 
showed him leading dukakis predicted a surprise victory 
republican bush and his wife barbara voted in houston shortly 
after sunup 
every time i vote here i feel nervous he told reporters 
no predictions he replied when asked about the outcome 
after two days of nonstop campaigning including predawn stops 
today in iowa and michigan democrat dukakis returned to boston 
i think tonight were not only going to surprise a few people 
but were going to be doing the celebrating he told supporters 
who welcomed him at the airport 
i voted for mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen and im proud of 
it he said after casting his ballot later along with wife kitty 
daughters andrea and kara and son john 
i come away from all of this even more optimistic about the 
future of this great country of ours than when i started a 
sleepless dukakis had told 3000 supporters who turned out for a 3 
am rally in subfreezing weather in des moines iowa 
our spirits are bright the future looks good were grateful 
to all of you he told several hundred people who stood in the 
rain in detroit 
initial reports from around the country were of a heavy early 
turnout of voters in georgia north carolina rhode island and 
tennessee elections officials said early turnout was heavier than 
normal 
bushs running mate dan quayle made no secret of his choice 
after voting in his hometown of huntington ind 
well we got one sure vote quayle said two chimed in 
his wife marilyn who accompanied him 
bentsen the democratic vice presidential nominee was in his 
home state of texas although he had used an absentee ballot to cast 
his vote early 
following longstanding tradition the 38 voters of dixville 
notch nh cast their ballots at midnight 
their votes the first counted were 34 for bush three for 
dukakis and one writein ballot for former republican candidate rep 
jack kemp of new york 
in rhode island tom diprete was arrested after he tore down 
campaign posters of democrat bruce sundlun who is running against 
dipretes father republican gov edward diprete 
on his fathers orders the younger diprete went to the sundlun 
campaign headquarters and apologized police released him without 
filing charges 
one of the nations most unusual contests was in union point 
ga where mayor ben stewart was being challenged by his younger 
brother bob 
the only comment i would want to make the mayor said is 
that its a very sad regrettable unfortunate situation 
with pollsters still finding millions of voters claiming they 
hadnt made up their minds bush and dukakis made finalhour appeals 
for support on television monday night 
i cannot predict all of the challenges america will face in the 
years ahead bush said at the conclusion of a 30minute television 
commercial broadcast on the three major networks i can tell you 
what principles will guide me what values i hold dear and i can say 
that i believe i have the experience to be a steady hand guiding our 
country 
he described dukakis as someone with no experience in national 
security affairs 
the democratic nominees 30minute appeal was on the networks 
immediately preceding the bush broadcast 
in his broadcast dukakis spoke of family jobs senior citizens 
hunger and farmers and answered questions on issues that have dogged 
him including his record on crime his military policy and his 
reluctance to respond to the negative attacks 
dukakis also charged anew that the republicans would try to 
balance the budget by cutting social security and he called bushs 
proposal to reduce capital gains taxes a new 40 billion 
fiveyear capital gains tax giveaway for the very rich 
now who is going to pay for that tax break dukakis asked 
look beside you look behind you look in the mirror and ask 
yourself is george bush on your side 
the campaigns paid about 1 million each for the time for their 
backtoback appeals 
we are running an unprecedented level of activity to turn out 
our voters said susan estrich dukakis campaign manager by 
our calculation theres a half a dozen to 10 states that are within 
a couple of points where being able to turn out our vote can make 
the difference 
the question is not whether turnout will go down but rather how 
far said curtis b gans director of the committee for the study 
of the american electorate 
while predicting that up to 95 million americans would vote gans 
said the percentage of eligible voters casting ballots could be the 
lowest since 1948 when it was 511 percent 
americans who do vote will elect 33 senators and the entire 
house as well as 12 governors and thousands of other state and 
locals officials 
of the senate seats being filled 18 currently are held by 
democrats and 15 by republicans by most estimates the democrats 
now holding a 5446 majority should keep control 
among the closest senate races were contests for open seats in 
florida washington wisconsin and mississippi threatened 
incumbents included chic hecht rnev lowell weicker rconn and 
john melcher dmont 
democrats control the house by a 255177 margin and not even the 
most partisan republicans expect that to change very much 
rep fernand st germain dri chairman of the house banking 
committee had his reelection prospects jolted two weeks ago when a 
federal judge made public a justice department report referring to 
substantial evidence of serious and sustained misconduct by the 
lawmaker 
the race between st germain and republican ronald k machtley was 
rated a tossup 
rep pat swindall rga was under indictment for perjury and 
was trailing democratic challenger ben jones in recent polls 
among the nations governors three republicans arch moore of 
west virginia edward diprete of rhode island and norman bangerter 
of utah were rated the most threatened in addition democrat evan 
bayh was favored to defeat republican john mutz in the race to 
succeed gop indiana gov robert d orr 
in the presidential race the polls offered encouraging news to 
bush with all indicating his lead had stabilized after narrowing 
somewhat over the weekend 
a cbs news poll said bushs lead had increased to nine points 
after narrowing to six during the weekend a harris poll that said 
dukakis had closed the gap to four points said that movement halted 
monday 
a new gallup poll said bush had an 11point lead that was holding 
steady the poll which had reported 20 percent undecided said that 
figure had dropped to 5 percent

at least 6700 ugandan refugees have 
returned home from the southern sudanese town of yei in a convoy of 
93 trucks state radio reported tuesday 
the refugees many of whom fled during the rule of dictator idi 
amin in the 1970s arrived sunday in the town of arua about 220 
miles northwest of kampala an official representing the united 
nations high commissioner for refugees told radio uganda 
the refugees were escorted to the ugandan border by sudanese 
troops to protect them from attacks by christian and animist rebels 
who are fighting for autonomy in southern sudan 
amin had about 100000 opponents killed before he was ousted in 
1979 and replaced by president milton obote ugandans continued to 
flee their country in the 1980s because of fighting between 
government troops and guerillas led by yoweri museveni

experts estimated that nearly 1295 million americans were 
registered to vote or slightly less than 71 percent of the eligible 
population a decline from four years ago on that basis the 
nonpartisan committee for the study of the american electorate 
predicted turnout would fall to its lowest level in 40 years or 
slightly over 50 percent 
that didnt deter the candidates who toed the starting line for 
the 1988 presidential race in the days following reagans 1984 
reelection landslide the marathon eventually consumed hundreds of 
millions of dollars 
after the tumult of the primary campaigns bush and dukakis both 
took early lumps before triumphing the presidential race came down 
to a bareknuckled battle between the 64yearold vice president and 
the 55yearold massachusetts governor 
not to mention their running mates the 41yearold quayle and 
the 67yearold bentsen for the democrats 
it fell to them to produce the most riveting moment of the 
campaign doubtless to quayles undying regret the indiana senator 
had just finished comparing himself favorably to john f kennedy 
when bentsen turned to him in campaign debate and said senator 
youre no jack kennedy 
bush campaigned as the loyal logical heir to reagan and his 
twoterm conservative revolution he promised to extend the peace 
and prosperity the president claimed as their legacy but with an 
emphasis on education child care and other issues that would make 
america a kinder gentler nation 
but he also turned on his rival with commercials of unsurpassed 
toughness and employed toughguy rhetoric in madefortelevision 
campaign appearances he said his reply to the democrats in congress 
would be read my lips no new taxes 
he trashed dukakis freely evoking images of jimmy carter when he 
said lets not gamble on another liberal governor coming out of 
nowhere who will take us back to the bad old days 
behind in the polls as the summer conventions were ending he 
flicked on the attack ads soft on crime soft on defense soft on 
the pledge of allegiance and soft on the environment the bush ads 
depicted dukakis as a quintessential massachusetts liberal a man 
outside of the mainstream 
bush made massachusetts furlough escapee willie horton a 
household name and one memorable advertisement depicted the states 
prison system as a revolving door 
dukakis had won the democratic nomination as the architect of the 
massachusetts miracle and touted his accomplishments in housing 
welfare reform mandatory health insurance and other concerns and 
he set out to win the fall campaign the same way 
he absorbed bushs punishing blows for weeks before heeding the 
pleas of bentsen and other prominent democrats to fight back by the 
time he did he was far behind in the polls and in need of another 
miracle 
after a lackluster performance in the second and final 
presidential debate he charted a new populist course and began 
waving republican brochures in the air to dramatize his complaints 
that bush was resorting to garbage to defeat him 
im on your side he said over and over to the average man 
and woman bush wants to help the people who have it made i want 
to help every american family make it he added 
he attacked quayle as a risky man to have so close to the oval 
office and made the unprecedented move of placing his own running 
mate on network television for a fiveminute commercial dukakis 
criticized bush and quayle in new tougher ads 
all this was a far cry from the man who stood before the 
democratic national convention and said the election isnt about 
ideology its about competence bush swiftly rebutted that at his 
own political coronation saying the race was about the values we 
honor 
bush had a campaign machine that hummed even while spitting 
political nails at dukakis 
the dukakis machine was a clunker in the judgment of many 
democrats around the country who faulted its advertising speeches 
and scheduling and finally its candidate 
by the end the polls agreed the election was turning voters off 
still neither bush nor dukakis hit the level of senate 
republican candidate jay wolfe in west virginia he aired a 
commercial juxtaposing byrd and a bloody fetus and the republican 
senatorial campaign committee ordered him to stop airing it 
bush hoped for a mainstream mandate but if there was a 
national trend in was difficult to discern in advance 
some democrats in senate races in florida and elsewhere distanced 
themselves from dukakis fearing they would be swept away if they 
did not but in ohio and washington democrats ran as liberal and 
proud 
some of the most powerful and best known members of congress were 
retiring voluntarily 
the list ran to democrat john stennis in mississippi william 
proxmire in wisconsin and lawton chiles in florida committee 
chairmen all the roster also included republican rep jack kemp 
who made a career of espousing conservative causes and harbors 
presidential hopes of his own as well as democratic rep peter 
rodino he led the house judiciary committee impeachment hearings 
against president richard nixon in 1974 
the prediction was that whoever the new president was the 
congress that greeted him would be democratic 
eightyone incumbents faced either no major part opposition or 
only thirdparty rivals that included 61 democrats and 20 
republicans 
republicans said they hoped to eat into the democrats senate 
majority but had scarcely the faintest hopes of recreating the 
reagan landslide in 1980 that swept a dozen democrats out of office 
reagan turned the white house into an arm of the bush campaign 
he appointed cabinet officers that would be attractive in an 
election year and swallowed his objections to democraticinspired 
plant closing legislation that bush didnt want vetoed for fear of 
the damage to his campaign 
with a final campaign stop in california the day before the 
election the president racked up 25000 miles for republican 
candidates 
we need you to ride with us he told a crowd at a rodeo 
center in texas and if you would i hope youll help win just one 
more for the gipper 
some sounded like they couldnt wait to saddle up for another 
ride 
jesse jackson spoke for ambitious democrats everywhere when he 
said a few days before the election that if dukakis lost on tuesday 
the next political season will begin on wednesday

the air is pungent with the smell of the 
sea and seagulls busily pick through piles of crushed oyster and 
clam shells but the pervading mood is mournful because the oysters 
are dying out 
since the late 1950s oysters in the delaware and chesapeake bays 
have been plagued by a parasite known as msx multinucleated 
sphere unknown 
off southern new jersey the problem has become so bad that 
oyster fishing has been almost entirely eliminated for the past two 
years people who make their living from the shellfish are hoping 
that a parasiteresistant strain of oysters can be introduced but 
meanwhile packing houses have had to modify their operations to 
survive 
at robbins bros oysters for instance newly painted signs 
announce that fresh seafood is now the main business 
we have 25 people working here now but at one time we had 
about 100 said coowner george mcconnell who fished for oysters 
for 20 years many have gone to work for the sand plant down the 
road some local factories or gone to atlantic city to work in the 
casinos 
down the road in port norris the peterson packing co now shucks 
and processes oysters trucked in from connecticut where the disease 
has not had an effect 
its a harsh reality there has been no oyster harvest last 
year or this year said manager harold bickings a former 
oysterman the last time we went to check on seed oysters in 
delaware bay they virtually had all died 
there arent any new jersey oysters around here they cant be 
called a thing of the past but they are definitely not a thing of 
the present 
oystermen in these small bay towns are holding out hope that 
rutgers university researchers stationed in nearby bivalve will 
find a solution 
we have a great amount of expectations that they can produce 
immune oysters bickings said 
john kraeuter associate director of the rutgers shellfish 
research laboratory said were making pretty good headway on 
such an oyster but its not going to revive the industry within the 
year 
when researchers found a way to breed a resistant strain of 
oyster local oystermen banded together to form a nonprofit 
corporation that put samples of the strain in an oyster bed to 
continue the research 
rutgers has the technology but they needed the physical work 
to continue this said robert morgan sr 61 a former oysterman 
who now manages the port norris oyster co a packing house that 
survived by switching to clams 
kraeuter said the test oysters are showing pretty good 
resistance once they are planted in the delaware bay but weve 
only got one batch so far we have a bunch more sitting on racks 
still to be planted 
in the meantime some loyal oystermen like 75yearold fenton 
anderson of port norris have been just relaxing during the msx 
crisis 
a lot of the younger people have gone crabbing and some have 
left the area and found other jobs but of course some people like 
me are too old to do anything else he said 
but theres always hope in the midst of despair anderson 
said i think they might be on to something now down at the 
rutgers lab in the meantime im not moldering ive still got my 
boat and i still lease my oyster beds from the state because you 
never know 
morgan added nobodys really happy about whats happened here 
but nobodys shedding tears either we all shifted to something 
else seafood clams crabs 
nobodys sitting around waiting for something to happen

argentina invaded the islands in april britain recovered them 74 
days later about 1000 soldiers from both sides lost their lives in

a rainy autumn helped ease the dryness in the 
east and some central states but large areas of the upper midwest 
are facing winter still in the grip of longterm drought 
subsurface soil moisture is still very low in a lot of 
states douglas lecomte a meteorologist with the department of 
agriculture said tuesday that could come back to haunt us next 
spring 
we still have lingering effects from the drought so we will 
definitely have to watch the winter rainfall to see if the soil 
moisture gets replenished he said 
fall rainfall eased the problem in the southeast especially 
rains from tropical storms lecomte said and moisture has improved 
in the ohio middle missouri and lower mississippi valleys 
but the federal climate analysis center lists conditions of 
extreme longterm drought as continuing in north dakota idaho 
wyoming most of montana and portions of south dakota minnesota 
iowa oregon and california 
much of that region received less than half of normal 
precipitation during the year that ended aug 31 and an even larger 
region received 75 percent or less during that 12month period 
severe drought also extends to surrounding areas as well as 
parts of north carolina tennessee illinois indiana ohio and 
virginia 
the assessments are based on the palmer drought index a complex 
longterm measurement that considers rainfall evaporation soil 
moisture and other factors 
planting of the winter wheat crop which is done in the fall 
is about complete lecomte says but problems may be lurking 
in kansas for example he explained that seeding is near 
completion crop emergence is good but lack of soil moisture may be 
limiting root development 
the west coast meanwhile should be starting its normally wet 
season as storms come ashore from the pacific ocean 
the west coast has had two dry winters in a row and this winter 
is getting off to a slow start lecomte added noting that the 
region depends on the winter snow pack to get through summer 
reservoir carryover in much of the west is poor due to heavy use 
for irrigation this summer according to the fall western water 
supply summary issued by the soil conservation service and national 
weather service 
in most regions of the west the 1989 water year begins with 
low soil moisture reserves low reservoir carryover and deficit 
seasonal precipitation the report states the water year is 
measured from autumn to autumn 
the nations overall shortage of moisture is no longer getting 
the attention it did a few weeks ago thanks largely to three 
factors the end of the major farm growing season a rise in river 
levels that improved barge traffic and rains that eased the dryness 
in eastern areas 
but in the still affected areas the outlook may be bleak 
with the start of the normally dry fall and winter months in 
the northern great plains prospects for significant precipitation 
to eliminate longterm dryness in the area appear unfavorable the 
climate analysis center said 
the climate analysis center is no longer listing the drought in 
the north central states among major climate anomalies the 
unusual weather or climate events it studies but thats only 
because dryness is normal at this time of year 
in question is whether winter will bring sufficient snowfall or 
next spring will provide the rains needed to restore the soil 
moisture to normal 
weather watchers are not making forecasts yet for spring but the 
national weather services 90day outlook through the end of january 
calls for lighter than normal snowfall over much of the upper 
midwest particularly in the great lakes region idaho montana and 
wyoming

army rescuers and medical teams finally reached 
stricken villages tuesday in a remote area near burma where chinas 
worst earthquake in more than a decade killed at least 930 people 
last weekend 
official beijing radio said more than 100 people had been rescued 
from the rubble of collapsed buildings and many more were believed 
to be trapped 
it said 1000 soldiers were involved in the rescue operation and 
the central government had allocated 536 million 
sunday nights temblor registered 76 on the richter scale 
indicating a quake of tremendous destructive force it was centered 
in lancang and menglian counties of yunnan province about 240 miles 
southwest of kunming the provincial capital 
more than 170 aftershocks had been felt by tuesday afternoon but 
their strength was declining said li xianhu of the state seismology 
bureau in beijing 
about 14 counties were affected covering 16000 square miles in 
a long corridor near yunnans southwestern frontier with burma 
officials said they did not know the population of the mountainous 
junglecovered region most of whose residents are farmers of the 
lahu va and dai minorities 
lancang county alone has 400000 people the civil affairs 
ministry said 
information on casualties and rescue work was sparse and most 
government offices refused to answer reporters questions but the 
civil affairs ministry told the un development program and world 
food program offices in beijing more than 930 people were killed 
the two agencies said the ministry did not request assistance 
ministry officials initially gave the same figure to some foreign 
reporters but later denied issuing it apparently because it had 
been released without permission 
sun shaocheng of the ministrys emergency rescue office said 
the number is climbing 
official media reported lower figures 
a beijing radio report late tuesday said 796 people were dead and 
840 injured xinhua the official news agency said 689 bodies had 
been recovered by tuesday evening and about 600 people were injured 
xinhua said the quake destroyed half the houses in the lancang 
county seat and nearby towns and 90 percent of those in the small 
towns of fubang zhutang and shangyong it did not give the 
populations of the towns 
it was chinas worst earthquake since one of 78 on the richter 
scale that leveled the northeastern city of tangshan on july 28 
1976 it killed 242000 people by official count 
the richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake 
as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph a temblor 
measuring 7 is capable of causing widespread heavy damage in 
populated areas each number on the scale means a tenfold increase 
of intensity 
early tuesday rescue teams reached the village of zhanmapo 
which virtually was destroyed by the quake the radio reported 
xie chao an employee of the station said he did not know the 
population of zhanmapo on monday the station identified the 
village as shanmato 
xinhuas bureau in kunming said the quake area had ample supplies 
of food and water but its main road link to the outside remained 
cut medical teams were flown in by helicopter but the television 
news showed soldiers driving in trucks through one heavily damaged 
area 
the news agency said medical teams were working to prevent an 
outbreak of disease due to the large number of dead and poor 
hygiene but gave no details the brief tv news report showed an 
aerial view of a heavily damaged town with victims being pulled 
from the rubble but the town was not named 
it is an area of heavy rains and most residents have wooden 
homes on stilts in valleys between the wuliang nu and other 
mountain ranges 
the lahu who live in lancang are buddhists related to tibetans 
and burmans the va also buddhist speak a language of the 
monkhmer family

michael dukakis home for the final count after an 
exhausting marathon run for the presidency looked to massachusetts 
tuesday for a safe 13 electoral votes in his democratic column 
massachusetts voters also were deciding whether to ban nuclear 
power in the state mandate humane treatment of farm animals 
repeal a legislative pay raise and repeal a state law requiring 
union wages on public construction projects 
dukakis governor here for 10 of the past 14 years led a 
traditionally strong democratic ticket in massachusetts where 
voters were expected to reelect sen edward m kennedy to a sixth 
term over republican challenger joseph d malone along with all 
incumbents in the states liberal house delegation those 
congressmen included kennedys nephew joseph p kennedy ii who was 
seeking a second term 
dukakis was favored in the last massachusetts opinion polls by a 
doubledigit margin over republican george bush who was also born 
in massachusetts but turned the states liberal reputation against 
dukakis in the general election 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
with a homestate candidate massachusetts politics was dominated 
by the presidential contest even though dukakis rarely visited his 
home state after labor day 
republicans seeking to cast doubt on dukakis effectiveness 
pointed to problems his administration was encountering in balancing 
the state budget bush fueled that campaign by venturing into boston 
twice in the campaign to highlight the pollution of boston harbor 
and to claim the boston police unions endorsement 
by late august dukakis saw his lead in massachusetts polls 
evaporate but with a late counteroffensive of radio advertising 
field organizing and appeals to homestate pride dukakis regained 
the edge by midoctober and widened it in the closing days

the condition of emperor hirohito deteriorated 
tuesday when his blood pressure plummeted but it later improved 
slightly palace officials said 
the 87yearold emperor discharged a small amount of blood early 
in the afternoon and his blood pressure fell as it has several 
times before but this time it did not recover despite an emergency 
blood transfusion palace spokesman kenji maeda said 
later in the afternoon hirohitos blood pressure still was only 
68 over 30 a level that can cause brain damage if not raised 
this is not an unexpected development but im concerned about 
how it will turn out maeda quoted the emperors chief physician 
akira takagi as saying 
vice grand steward iwao miyao said the emperors vital signs were 
improving in the evening and his upper blood pressure reading had 
risen to about 90 a normal blood pressure reading is about 120 over 
80 
maeda said the emperor remained conscious during and after the 
blood discharge which occurred while he was watching his regular 
daily 15minute television drama 
his temperature normally 959 degrees soared to 1022 degrees 
this afternoon but dropped to 991 degrees by evening palace 
sources said 
his condition has slightly improved since 530 pm but we are 
still concerned about his condition and we will continue to monitor 
it carefully and give necessary treatment maeda said 
the 126pint transfusion tuesday brought the total amount of 
blood hirohito has received to more than 41 pints since he first 
began suffering from internal bleeding sept 19 
palace sources say it will be difficult to continue giving him 
blood because doctors are having difficulty finding suitable veins 
to administer the transfusions 
also tuesday prince aya the emperors 22yearold grandson 
visited hirohito with his family aya has been studying at britains 
oxford univerity and returned to japan on monday 
ayas return was rather hastily decided because of the 
emperors worsening condition maeda said

the implementation of drug and alcohol testing 
policies by the star tribune without bargaining with the local guild 
has been ruled an unfair labor practice in a case that could become 
a national precedent 
the companys refusal to provide information about the policys 
enforcement at the unions request also is an unfair labor practice 
administrative law judge wallace nations ruled last week in 
washington 
he said such testing meets legal definitions of issues that must 
be negotiated between employers and unions 
the case has the potential to be precedentsetting nationwide 
because the national labor relations board has not yet ruled on any 
appeals involving the issue said diane williams assistant director 
of the nlrbs information division 
if the company does not appeal nations ruling by dec 1 the 
nlrb will adopt it routinely probably in early december and 
nations recommendations will take effect said joe moore the 
boards deputy executive secretary 
if the company does appeal a panel or the full board will 
consider it he said 
john dennison vice president of labor relations for the 
newspaper said monday that the company was disappointed by the 
ruling but had not decided whether to appeal 
the judge recommended that the company be ordered to revoke its 
drug and alcohol testing policies covering applicants and employees 
in jobs covered by its contract with local 2 of the news guild of 
the twin cities and to negotiate future policies with the guild the 
local represents about 350 newsroom and circulation employees of the 
star tribune 
nations also recommended that the newspaper be required to offer 
a job to any applicant rejected under the policy since it was 
imposed on jan 1 1987 and pay the applicant for related losses 
he also recommended that the company rescind any punishment that 
might have been imposed on employees under the policy and compensate 
them for their losses 
the star tribunes policy requires a medical exam including drug 
and alcohol screening for applicants to whom the company offers a 
job if applicants test positive the company will withdraw the job 
offer 
the policy also provides that current employees may be asked to 
undergo screening when management believes that job performance or 
conduct is impaired by alcohol or drug abuse 
dennison said no employee has been tested under the policy since 
it took effect and that he knew of only one job applicant who had 
withdrawn after learning about the policy 
under nations recommendations the newspaper would be required 
to give the union the names and addresses of people who have applied 
for guildcovered jobs at the paper since the policy took effect and 
identify those who refused to take the tests

the parents of mohammed hamadi 
testified at his trial tuesday with his father saying the confessed 
hijacker was under 21 at the time of the incident and his mother 
saying he was innocent 
the defendant burst into tears when his mother entered the 
courtroom 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem is charged with murder and air 
piracy in the june 1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner to beirut us 
navy diver robert stethem 23 was killed and 39 americans were held 
hostage for 17 days 
stethems parents also attended the trial tuesday his father 
richard took notes and his mother patricia watched the 
proceedings with little show of emotion 
chief judge heiner mueckenberger told hamadis mother fatima 
that relatives can refuse to testify because its easy to give 
false statements out of love 
she replied i know that my son is innocent i know that hes 
very young and that we live under terrible conditions in beirut 
of the case itself she said i dont know anything about this 
i cant read or write 
hamadi has admitted taking part in the hijacking but denied 
killing stethem 
fatima hamadi and her 59yearold husband ali hassan traveled 
to frankfurt from beirut last week to testify when she walked into 
the courtroom tuesday in a black dress with a white shawl covering 
her head mohammed hamadi stood up until she was seated in the 
witness stand 
he held his hand to his heart and bowed as she began replying to 
mueckenbergers questions in a soft shaky voice then suddenly he 
burst into tears and dried his eyes with handkerchief 
those accused of terrorism in the middle east seldom face trial 
and it is even rarer for parents of a defendant to appear in court 
ali hassan hamadi testified his son fought with the shiite 
militia amal in beirut because war had begun and everyone fought 
mohammed was injured in the fighting said the father he 
was hit in the head and we all thought we had lost him 
asked by mueckenberger if he thought the young man had recovered 
fully from the head injuries he replied i dont know exactly if 
hes right in his head his son and others in the court laughed at 
the response 
both parents testified in arabic which was translated into 
german by a court interpreter 
the judge asked ali hassan hamadi about the work of mohammeds 
older brother abdul hadi hamadi beirut security chief for the 
shiite group hezbollah which is allied with iran and is believed to 
be an umbrella group for those holding foreign hostages in lebanon 
i know about amal and i know about hezbollah but i dont know 
who works for them and im not interested the father said 
he said he lives in bourj elbarajneh the south beirut district 
is a hezbollah stronghold 
court records show mohammed hamadi was born june 13 1964 the 
father when asked the birthdate said 
he was born on lebanons independence day nov 22 in 1964 i 
can remember because its a holiday and i did not have to work that 
day 
his age at the time of the hijacking whether he was an adult 
is important in determining the length of the prison sentence if 
mohammed hamadi is convicted 
if it is determined that he was 21 at the time of the hijacking 
he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if it is found that 
he was younger at the time of the crime the maximum sentence is 15 
years in prison 
the defendants lebanese wife najad said in the spectator 
section which is separated from the main courtroom by bulletproof 
glass wearing a black chador that covered her hair but not her 
face they were married in late 1986 
his oldest brother adnan also was present the father said 
adnan was born sometime in 1951 and all the familys 11 children 
were delivered at home by midwife 
mohammed hamadi was arrested at the frankfurt airport jan 13 
1987 after customs agents found liquid explosives in his luggage 
the united states requested extradition but west germany refused 
fearing for the lives of two west german hostages held in beirut at 
the time 
abbas hamadi 29 was convicted by a duesseldorf court in april 
of planning the kidnappings to gain mohammeds freedom and was 
sentenced to 13 years in prison 
he also was arrested at frankfurt airport in january 1987 two 
weeks after his brother both west german hostages have been 
released

the united states is doubtful that vietnam will 
keep its promise to pull 50000 troops out of cambodia this year 
and the soviet union has refused to press its vietnamese allies for 
a detailed withdrawal timetable the state department said tuesday 
spokesman charles redman said assistant secretary of state gaston 
sigur and soviet deputy foreign minister igor rogachev discussed the 
matter last week the two met for 10 hours in paris to discuss the 
cambodian situation and the recent thaw between north and south 
korea he said 
in an unrelated development redman announced that sigur had 
canceled a planned trip to tokyo beijing and seoul because of 
pressing business here he declined to elaborate and said he did 
not know whether the visit would be rescheduled 
those governments will be briefed on the sigurrogachev meeting 
by other us officials he said 
sigur urged rogachev to press vietnam for an exact timetable on 
the withdrawal from cambodia redman told reporters 
the soviet side expressed confidence that vietnamese military 
forces will be out of cambodia by early 1990 but declined to make a 
commitment to urge hanoi to adopt a detailed withdrawal timetable 
the spokesman said 
earlier this year vietnam said it would pull all its estimated 
120000 troops from cambodia by 1990 50000 of them by the end of 
this year but redman said that since june 1 only 10000 to 15000 
have left 
there are signs that vietnam is preparing to withdraw more 
troops in coming months but we remain skeptical that the 50000 
pledge will be met redman said 
us officials were hoping that a vietnamese timetable would help 
move forward talks between the three major opposition groups and the 
vietnameseinstalled government in cambodia on a peace settlement 
the united states is especially seeking to prevent a return to 
power of the chinesebacked khmer rouge a faction that ruled 
cambodia in the late 1970s and is believed to have killed as many as 
1 million cambodians the khmer rouge is one of the three major 
opposition groups conducting the talks on the countrys future 
sigur emphasized the importance of effective safeguards to 
prevent the khmer rouge from regaining control of cambodia and the 
need for an international presence to monitor any settlement 
redman said 
both the united states and the soviet union are prepared along 
with other countries to participate in international guarantees 
and favor international monitoring of the implementation of 
agreements among the parties to the conflict he added 
the united states had hoped that a credible vietnamese pullout 
schedule would put pressure on china to end its support for the 
khmer rouge the soviet union in talks expected to lead to the 
first sinosoviet summit in 30 years has also discussed with the 
matter with the chinese

residents of this mountain village that 
calls itself the hometown of michael dukakis gathered around cafe 
radios tuesday night clinging to hopes of a democratic victory in 
the us presidential election 
earlier in the day several hundred villagers dressed in their 
sunday best made a pilgrimage to a whitewashed 18th century 
monastery six miles from pelopi to kiss a silverplated icon of st 
michalis 
the election coincided with the nov 8 feastday of st michalis 
greek for michael who is the patron saint of pelopi the village 
is located on the northern aegean island of mytilene also known as 
lesvos 
i lit a candle for michalis and said a prayer for his electoral 
success but whether he wins or not he has made greece and our 
village proud said costas stefanou the president of the village 
council 
dukakis whose grandfather was born in pelopi is known as 
michalis to villagers who met him during a brief visit to the island 
in 1976 
stefanou said he had been more than optimistic about dukakis 
chances but other villagers were less hopeful as they waited for 
the returns 
were a bit discouraged by the latest polls and well be in 
despair if he doesnt win said efstratios patsis the village 
butcher as he downed a glass of ouzo 
the villagers gathered around woodburning stoves in three cafes 
toasting each other with ouzo to keep out the cold 
stefanou said that no matter what the outcome dukakis would be 
offered a plot of land in pelopi for a summer home he said the 
village also had made plans to build a hotel 50 rooms if he 
wins smaller if he doesnt 
dukakis cousins on the island who all live in mytilene town 
also awaited the election results via radio 
were hoping that michalis has been able to catch up enough 
over the final days to win said elly petridou a second cousin 
in athens the friends of michael dukakis organization held an 
election watch in their offices with telephone links to the 
massachusetts governors campaign headquarters 
the group helped more than 30000 americans living in greece with 
registering to vote in the us elections 
their votes may be very important since many of these people 
were registering in states like california new york and ohio which 
are crucial to the outcome said nikos revezoulis the groups 
chairman 
many athenians stayed up late to watch the election results on 
satellite television channels which started broadcasting to greece 
just two weeks ago 
several thousand people attended an allnight election watch at 
an athens hotel organized by greek americans and american 
expatriates with help from the us embassy 
dukakis was the favored candidate over vice president george bush 
by a wide margin among american voters living in athens 
this time weve been lucky to catch a 20 percent republican 
vote in greece because of the local factor said katy angelis of 
republicans abroad international

waited in the dark to vote in kearns utah attracted in part by a 
hot campaign over a taxcutting proposal 
ive had a habit of sitting back and complaining about state 
government so at least this way i know i spoke out by voting

before casting the first ballot 
three presidents john adams john quincy adams and john f 
kennedy were born in norfolk county mass and both bush and

the office of the comptroller of the currency 
is preparing guidelines requiring nationally chartered banks to more 
carefully consider their involvement in leveraged buyouts 
within the next several weeks the agency will be sending new 
guidelines to its examiners and to banks to help them evaluate when 
an institution is vulnerable because of highly leveraged lending 
said lee cross a spokeswoman for comptroller robert clarke his 
office regulates 4450 of the nations 13400 commercial banks 
in a leveraged buyout or lbo such as kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
cos 206 billion bid for rjr nabisco inc an investment group 
borrows heavily in order to buy out stockholders and take over the 
company 
often the investment group is composed of the target companys 
management which is acting to thwart a threatened takeover by 
outsiders the companys new owners either cut costs or sell off 
pieces of the company to pay back the loans 
the popularity of such deals and the resulting proliferation of 
debt has led to growing concern about the prospects of heavily 
burdened companies in an economic downturn 
critics of leveraged buyouts say most of the deals have been put 
together since 1982 when the economy began expanding and have not 
been tested by a recession 
if a highly capitalized company suffers a downturn the value of 
its stock falls however a highly leveraged company suffering a 
setback could be forced into bankruptcy to pay creditors 
according to loan pricing corp a new york company that monitors 
large bank loans to corporations banks have lent 70 billion to 
highly leveraged transactions since mid1987 lbos and takeover 
lending comprised 59 percent of the banks big corporate loans in 
the julyseptember quarter 
last month federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan whose 
agency regulates bank holding companies told the senate banking 
committee that he had warned banks making leveraged buyout loans to 
consider borrowers prospects in a range of economic and financial 
circumstances 
ms cross said the comptrollers office began revising its 
leveraged buyout guidelines after surveying the practices of 11 
large money center banks and five regional institutions in late 
spring and early summer 
we found that so far the banks that have been involved seem to 
have taken a pretty reasonable approach our concern now is going 
forward as competition in this area heats up the spokeswoman 
said no bank was perfect but we did not see any really 
substantial problems 
the new examiniation guidelines will not impose limits on lbo 
lending but ms cross said they will direct examiners to determine 
if a banks policies include limits on lbo lending as a whole and 
limits for single deals 
she said examiners also will be checking to see if banks are 
establishing adequate reserves against expected lbo losses and 
whether they have systems in place to adequately track the 
performance of the loans 
we want to make sure banks are doing a very careful analysis of 
exactly what the risks are she said 
another concern is that large banks often sell interests in the 
loans to smaller institutions which should be doing their own 
independent credit analysis rather than relying on the originating 
bank the spokeswoman said 
one problem in developing the guidelines is that banks have 
widely varying definitions for what they consider highly leveraged 
lending she said 
the federal reserve bank of new york is working on a definition 
of highly leveraged debt which will be ready in several months 
said spokesman peter bakstansky it could serve as guidance to other 
federal regulators

political instability and antisemitism in 
austria helped pave the way for the annihilation of jews that began 
with the violence of kristallnacht 50 years ago chancellor franz 
vranitzky said tuesday 
nazi thugs ran rampant on the night of nov 910 1938 in 
germany and austria which adolf hitler had annexed to his third 
reich eight months before they burned synagogues and shops killed 
scores of jews and arrested thousands for deportation to 
concentration camps 
the nazis named it crystal night boastfully for the shattered 
glass that littered the streets 
austrias head of state normally would give a nationally 
broadcast address and attend other events on such an anniversary 
but president kurt waldheim has been accused of involvement in nazi 
atrocities 
he issued a statement through his press office saying the 
devastation and destruction of kristallnacht as well as the 
mishandling and the horrific deaths of numerous people showed the 
regime of that time in its entire brutality 
the nearly complete expulsion and destruction of the jewish 
people has left deep wounds in the country up to the present day 
waldheim said 
vienna had 180000 jews on that night that began the 
extermination of 6 million european jews by adolf hitler who was 
born in austria about 7000 now live in the city 
in west berlin 5000 people held a solemn procession to mark the 
anniversary communist east germany observed it by honoring jewish 
leaders 
avi weiss an american rabbi and outspoken opponent of waldheim 
said the austrian observances are hypocritical while he is president 
weiss who came to vienna for the occasion said it is a false 
commemoration since 50 years after the event strong elements of 
nazism remain here he called waldheim an unrepentant exnazi 
vranitzky took over the ceremonial duties because of the 
controversy about waldheim who was a german army lieutenant in the 
balkans during world war ii but denies committing war crimes 
an international panel of historians said it found no evidence of 
waldheims direct involvement but left the question of guilt open 
on kristallnacht 42 synagogues were completely destroyed in 
vienna alone the city now has only one 
in a speech to his cabinet broadcast nationally on radio 
vranitzky said at least 27 jews were killed in vienna 88 seriously 
injured and 6547 arrested 
looking back on this year of anniversaries including that of the 
anschluss with hitlers germany vranitzky said austria had 
sincerely tried to understand the truth 
we have learned to differentiate between our role as the victim 
of a military aggression and the culpable involvement of many 
austrians who more or less voluntarily were prepared to do the dirty 
work for an inhuman and criminal regime the chancellor 
declared 
we must be careful not to perceive this night of horror as a 
single event he said because too much happened in the 
preceding years and the path had already been paved 
vranitzky cited events of 191838 the end of the 
austrohungarian monarchy establishment of the austrian republic 
the deep uncertainty of the austrians the doubt over the states 
ability to exist and the economic and social destitution 
he said austria owes it the victims not to end this 
commemoration year on dec 31 we want to keep in our heads and in 
our hearts the content of what we have worked through in this 
commemoration year also in the future 
waldheims statement warned against spreading a cloak of 
silence over the nazi years 
the commemoration of this pogrom and the suffering of the jews 
during the era of national socialism nazism must be a warning and 
a charge to prevent anything similar from ever happening 
again he said

a contra leader insisted tuesday that the nicaraguan 
rebels are far from defeat despite the cutoff of us aid their 
mass retreat to honduras and the pessimism of some of their own 
leaders 
the divided rebel movement has appeared stalled since congress 
voted to cut off military aid in deference to the central american 
peace plan sponsored by costa rican president oscar arias sanchez 
contra director alfredo cesar last month called for further peace 
talks with the sandinistas saying the military fight against 
nicaraguas leftist rulers is no longer viable 
but on tuesday wilfredo montalvan another of the contras seven 
directors strenuously denied the rebels have lost their war against 
the sandinistas 
some believe we suffered a hard blow with the suspension of 
us military aid but we are far from being defeated montalvan 
said 
the contras he emphasized are not merely instruments of us 
policy in central america to be discarded when they are no longer 
useful in pressuring the sandinista government 
we cannot and should not permit our people to continue 
sacrificing themselves only for pressure montalvan warned that 
is immoral when wars are waged it is to win or to lose nothing 
else 
he called for renewed military aid to the contras saying the 
soviet union was giving the sandinistas 40 million a month and he 
said he would meet with whoever wins the us presidential election 
to get a definition of us policy toward nicaragua 
since the aid cutoff the vast majority of contra troops as many 
as 10000 have retreated from nicaragua in favor of camps along the 
honduran border 
their host honduras president jose azcona hoyo said last week 
the lack of military aid had resulted in the defeat of the 
nicaraguan contras 
the movement known formally as the nicaraguan resistance has 
long been divided between hardline and moderate factions and now 
they no longer appear to be communicating with each other 
many in the resistance see now this isnt working the 
resistance is withering this is lost said former contra 
spokeswoman marta sacasa who lost her job to the hardline wing 
earlier this year 
but the contras current spokesman bosco matamoros dismisses 
the divergent views within the movement as simply an exploration 
of new strategies 
and he insists that the rebel army despite its problems remains 
viable 
our forces are still intact he said there is still 
command and control

sinhalese extremists threatened to 
attack resort hotels on sri lankas south coast prompting the 
evacuation of nearly 9000 foreign tourists officials said 
a senior official of the government tourist board called the 
evacuation an unnecessary panic the government and embassies 
denied reports that all foreign tourists were advised to leave the 
country 
the tourist official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the board only had instructed tourists to avoid travel in the south 
he said southern hotels had been advised to transfer their guests 
north to colombo and negombo 
most of the evacuated tourists were from west germany britain 
france and italy 
the tourist board issued its warning after 10 hotels in the 
kalutara district received leaflets or telephone calls threatening 
attacks unless the tourists left the district is 25 miles south of 
colombo the capital 
hotel staffers who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
threats were issued by the peoples liberation front 
the front called a fourday strike starting monday to press its 
demands for the resignation of president junius r jayewardene and 
his government most businesses heeded the strike call 
authorities have blamed the radical sinhalese group for the 
killings of more than 550 people mostly sinhalese who support the 
government in the last 15 months 
the government said the front had killed 16 people in a series of 
attacks in southern and central sri lanka on monday and tuesday 
the front is not known to have singled out any foreigners since 
it launched a series of bombings and assassinations following the 
governments announcement of a peace accord for the island nations 
tamil ethnic minority on july 29 1987 
the front denounced the accord saying president junius r 
jayewardene a sinhalese had sold out the interests of the 
sinhalese majority in his attempts to pacify tamil separatist 
guerrillas 
more than 8000 people mostly sinhalese have been killed 
since tamil rebel groups mounted their campaign of civilian 
massacres and attacks against the government in 1983 
the mainly hindu tamils who compose about 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million population say they are discriminated against by 
the buddhist sinhalese majority 
tourism this year is running about 50 percent below what it was 
before ethnic tensions turned violent in 1983 
despite the trouble sri lankas beaches and mountain retreats 
have drawn 200000 foreign visitors so far this year compared with 
182000 for all of 1987 according to tourist board figures 
the evacuated tourists filled hotels in colombo and in the beach 
resorts in negombo 20 miles north of colombo 
negombos mixed population of sinhalese and tamils have lived 
peacefully together for many decades

the highlevel advisory commission on the 
federal budget deficit beset by deep divisions among panel members 
may delay issuing its recommendations for several months the 
cochairman of the group said tuesday 
democrat robert strauss one of two leaders of the bipartisan 
national economic commission said the groups report may not be 
issued until march 1 or later 
this would mark a turnabout from the commissions original goal 
of issuing its recommendations by dec 21 in time to influence the 
first budget submitted by the incoming administration 
strauss in a speech to an investment conference sponsored by the 
american stock exchange and in later comments to reporters said the 
timing of the panels report would be left up to the wishes of the 
next president 
supporters of the 12member commission created by congress last 
december believed that it offered the best hope of breaking through 
the sevenyear political deadlock over reducing the federal budget 
deficit the commission was expected to come up with a package of 
spending cuts and tax increases that would be acceptable to the 
white house and congress 
congress gave the commission a deadline of march 1 for issuing 
its recommendations the law allows the next president to extend 
that deadline to sept 1 
however at its first meeting last may the commission announced 
it had agreed to an accelerated schedule that would have a final 
report completed by dec 21 so the panels recommendations could 
help shape the presidentelects first budget submission to congress 
strauss comments tuesday were the first public confirmation of 
reports that the commission would not meet that selfimposed 
deadline 
strauss conceded that the panel was a rather stormy 
commission and said we are going to have a hard time coming up 
with an acceptable package 
he said that while he was concerned he was not pessimistic that 
the commission would be able to draft a deficitreduction plan by 
the march 1 deadline or sept 1 if the new president decides to 
extend the deadline 
two members of the panel former defense secretaries caspar 
weinberger and donald rumsfeld have made it clear that they favor 
faster growth in military spending than congress has allowed while 
at the same time they oppose higher taxes 
another panelist dean kleckner president of the american farm 
bureau federation has said in speeches that he would work to block 
recommendations for tax increases 
in comments to reporters after his speech strauss said he was 
not totally ruling out an attempt by the commission to complete its 
work by the dec 21 date but he said such an effort would not be 
launched without approval from the presidentelect who will appoint 
the final two members of the panel 
whatever he wants he can have strauss said of the 
presidentelect 
republican presidential nominee george bush has been openly 
skeptical of the commission saying he would not accept 
recommendations for tax increases 
strauss refused comment when asked about reports that he has 
discussed the commissions role with bush campaign chairman james a 
baker iii

the us postal service is considering 
launching a highspeed money order service that would allow people 
to transfer funds anywhere in the country almost instantly 
the service would compete with western unions widely advertised 
money transfer service 
postmaster general anthony m frank said tuesday that the agency 
is preparing to file a request with the independent postal rate 
commission for permission to launch the new express money order 
service 
the service would permit a customer to purchase a money order in 
one office for delivery within minutes to someone in another 
location anywhere in the country 
we plan to provide express money order service at postal 
windows on a cash basis through an 800 tollfree telephone number 
with a major credit card and through qualified independent service 
providers frank told the monthly meeting of the services board 
of governors 
a postal express money order will in effect extend the 
benefits of emergency funds transfer to virtually every american 
regardless of location or banking status and we see this as a 
valuable public service frank said 
no date for filing the formal application to start the service 
was disclosed and consideration by the postal rate commission can 
take several months 
western unions service permits consumers to transfer money 
instantly among 12000 outlets across the country 
that service handled about 10 million transactions last year 
moving 3 billion from one place to another and netting the company 
about 200 million in revenues according to western union 
western union officials had no immediate comment about the 
potential competition from the postal service

a referendum on marylands unique gun control 
law came down to a dead heat tuesday after the most expensive 
election campaign in the states history 
the battle over the gun law dominated a campaign that also 
produced a close race between george bush and michael dukakis for 
marylands 10 electoral votes late opinion polls showed the 
presidential contest too close to call

the gun law passed last april set up a ninemember board 
appointed by the governor to prepare a list of handguns that could 
be sold in the state maryland gun groups with the backing of the 
national rifle association collected enough petition signatures to 
force a referendum on the law 
the bill was intended to ban saturday night specials cheap 
handuns that supporters of the law say are often used by street 
criminals and young teenagers 
faced with early polls showing that almost 80 percent of voters 
favored the law the nra mounted a 4millionplus campaign to 
convince marylanders that the board could ban sales of all handguns 
a claim hotly disputed by supporters 
backers of the law had only about onetenth as much money to 
spend as the nra and by election day their early lead in the polls 
had all but evaporated 
both sides said the outcome in maryland could affect the future 
of gun control efforts nationally 
either way it goes its going to have some impacts in other 
states said richard gaardiner an nra counsel in washington 
michael beard of the national coalition to ban handguns called 
the referendum the most significant vote in the last five to 10 
years on gun control

indias supreme court tuesday stayed the 
executions of two sikhs convicted in the 1984 assassination of prime 
minister indira gandhi the united news of india reported 
it was the third time the executions have been delayed 
a twojudge panel granted the stay after hearing an appeal that 
the men not be hanged until a murder charge filed by one of them is 
investigated the report said 
mrs gandhi was killed at her new delhi residence oct 31 1984 
satwant singh who was convicted for pulling the trigger on the 
weapon that killed her charged that security men disarmed him and 
the other alleged assassin beant singh then fired on them 
satwant singh was injured in the shootout and beant singh was 
fatally wounded 
all sikhs have the name singh meaning lion in punjabi by 
doctrine of the faith 
satwant singh and kehar singh who was convicted of conspiracy in 
mrs gandhis killing were sentenced to death in 1986 the sentence 
was upheld by the delhi high court last year and by the supreme 
court in august 
on oct 12 satwant singh filed a complaint in a magistrates 
court charging the security guards with murder and attempted murder 
the magistrate is to rule on it nov 15 
the men first were scheduled to be hanged oct 19 in new delhis 
tihar jail but the supreme court stayed the execution until nov 1 
then delayed it for another week 
the gandhi killing apparently was in revenge for an army raid the 
prime minister ordered four months earlier on the golden temple in 
amritsar the holiest sikh shrine in the northern state of punjab 
the shrine was being used as a base by sikh militants who since 
1982 have waged a violent campaign for a homeland in punjab at 
least 1200 people were killed in the raid most of them sikhs 
sikhs who make up only 2 percent of indias 880 million people 
form a majority in punjab and claim they are discriminated against 
by the majority hindus 
more than 2230 people mostly civilians have been killed in

a woman whose newborn baby was abducted 
from her arms at a hospital by a phony nurse went home tuesday and 
authorities said they were no closer to finding the frail infant 
a week after the kidnapping at doctors hospital annette 
thomasjones appealed to the woman who took the baby to call a 
friend call the police call a minister and tell them ive 
done something wrong 
tendayold christopher michael jones was born six weeks 
premature doctors have said he could die if he did not get proper 
medical attention 
mrs thomasjones 32 called for a nationwide effort to find her 
child 
its a matter of a whole country being involved this is 
something that could happen to anyone she said 
flashing a brief subdued smile when she and her husband willie 
jones 39 appeared at a hospital news conference tuesday she said 
she would never give up hope that her son would be found 
i leave with a charge to continue the search continue the 
fight once my health gets to the stage where i can physically if 
its necessary search every home in little rock im going to find 
my child she said 
mrs thomasjones who previously had maintained her composure in 
public then broke into tears later outside the hospital she 
sobbed freely 
authorities said a woman dressed in a white sweater and white 
pleated skirt and posing as a nurse went to mrs thomasjones room 
on the night of nov 1 and took the baby saying he needed to be 
weighed a hospital employee discovered the baby missing about a 
halfhour later and notified police 
police lt rl jenkins said the police department had received 
hundreds of calls about the case but none had produced a 
significant lead to the babys whereabouts 
a number of calls looked very promising when we got them but 
fizzled out jenkins said 
at this point in time to be perfectly candid when that woman 
left the hospital with that baby were not a whole lot closer to 
finding the baby than we were then jenkins said 
hospital administrator perry kinder said a 26500 reward being 
offered for the babys safe return would be in effect indefinitely 
he said the hospital would continue to provide assistance to the 
family in keeping the case before the public as long as it takes 
he said that while mrs thomasjones was sent home by her 
doctors her son would probably not have been well enough to have 
accompanied her if he were still in the hospitals nursery

a brussels police strike spread 
throughout the country tuesday following a call by the national 
police union 
the strike began monday in brussels to back demands for better 
pay and working conditions and more staff the union said it would 
affect administrative police services nationwide 
for a second straight day brussels police answered only calls 
for help if lives were at stake or did basic administrative work but 
dropped routine patrol or traffic control work 
the action spread to two brussels suburbs and to antwerp where 
patrol cars circled the city but did not report their location 
brussels mayor herve brouhon asked for an emergency meeting with 
interior minister louis tobback on the strike 
the national state police joined in the protest although not in 
the walkout saying in a statement released by its union that 
there can be no efficient state police nor sufficient security if 
state policemen are discredited on professional family and social 
levels 
the state police union implied the corps could also go on strike 
and would not replace striking city policemen or prison guards

one of 26 liverpool soccer fans charged 
with manslaughter in a stadium riot told a court tuesday the 
defendants had every reason to attack italian fans 
thirtynine people were killed in the may 28 riot at the european 
cup final between liverpool and juventus of turin italy at the 
heysel stadium 
britons should never have been given access to the same part of 
the stadium as the italians said terence wilson 22 the police 
were not up to the task 
we had every reason to attack the italians wilson added 
all the more since british supporters felt threatened for they 
were in smaller numbers 
among those criticized for improperly organizing the match were 
the mayor of brussels his deputy the president of the belgian 
soccer union and two top officials of the european soccer union 
officials had tried to separate the italians from the britons by 
selling tickets to different parts of the stadium and setting up a 
fence between the two sides 
but as several liverpool fans have testified the britons ended 
up in the italian camp after buying tickets on the black market 
the fragile separation between the two sides collapsed when the 
few police officers guarding the fence fled when the british fans 
began charging 
we attacked the italians because we were provoked they not 
only abused us verbally but threw stones at us and hit us 
testified liverpool fan timothy williams 
he said it was then that the liverpool fans charged the italians 
two belgian police officers also are on trial for not reacting 
properly to the incidents that led to the fatal stampede which 
caused a stand holding the fans to collapse 
the stadium was also in poor condition wilson said 
the trial which is in its fourth week is expected to run 
through december

secretary of state george p shultz on tuesday 
urged the next us president to be realistic and deal with the 
soviet union when it is in americas selfinterest 
we shouldnt be afraid to do it he said in an election day 
speech to young political leaders from around the world 
he praised the reform efforts of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and said that if gorbachev succeeds the soviet union 
will be a very different place 
but later opening an exhibit of a soviet photographer sergey 
petrov who is barred from leaving his country shultz criticized 
emigration restrictions 
we will continue to press hard for sergeys release as long as 
he is held against his will shultz said 
petrov was denied a visa on the grounds he worked in a physics 
laboratory years ago the photographer and his mother also were 
refused permission to attend the exhibition of his work at the state 
department 
at least i feel when my works get out part of me gets out 
too petrov said in a letter to a friend that shultz quoted 
in his foreign policy speech shultz said gorbachev and his 
supporters deserve credit for recognizing the problems and trying 
to solve them 
as a result he said the environment for democratic values 
peace and freedom is probably healthier than it has been for some 
time 
within the reagan administration shultz has played a leading 
role in promoting armscontrol agreements with moscow and seeking 
other ways to reduce tensions 
his speech which had the earmarks of a valedictory was aimed at 
presidential candidates michael dukakis and george bush as well as 
foreign leaders shultz said everyone should recognize the dangers 
of ballistic missiles and chemical weapons proliferation 
when we see an opportunity for problemsolving when there is 
an opportunity to do something that they the soviets want to do 
and that we think it is in our interest in the interest of friends 
around the world we shouldnt be afraid to do it in other words 
engage shultz said 
he said whether bush or dukakis won the united states should be 
vigilant in dealing with the soviet union were going to be 
realistic but at the same time pragmatic shultz said 
on a related subject shultz said he was confident the soviets 
would complete their withdrawal of troops from afghanistan despite 
an announcement last week that the pullout had been suspended 
the soviets last spring committed themselves to remove by feb 15 
the last of the more than 100000 troops they have had in that 
country 
meanwhile the leader of the afghan resistance alliance met with 
state department officials burhanuddin rabbani appealed for us 
aid for afghan refugees and to rehabilitate the wartorn country 
petrov 35 first applied to emigrate from the soviet union in 
1981 and was refused on grounds of state security his photographs 
have been shown in paris and washington but he has never been 
permitted to attend 
in a statement distributed at the exhibit petrov said my 
problem as an artist and as a professional is that i like challenge 
and it doesnt do me any good when i think that i am probably the 
best photographer in the soviet union 
it doesnt do me any good professionally and i dont want to be 
that big fish in a small pond id rather come to the united states 
and start from the bottom because then i could see how far i could 
go and i would know my real value

a prosecutor on tuesday called for the 
extradition of a palestinian wanted by the united states for the 
1982 bombing of a pan am jetliner 
mohammed rashid is charged with planting a bomb that exploded 
aboard a pan american world airways jetliner on a tokyohawaii 
flight a japanese teenager was killed and 15 other people were 
injured 
panayiotis theodoropoulos president of the fivemember supreme 
court panel said a decision on the extradition would be issued nov 
15 
united states officials have said they view the extradition of 
rashid 39 as a test of greeces determination to fight terrorism 
the prosecutors view is a blow against the palestinian people 
and the palestine liberation organization rashid told the court 
he was arrested at athens airport on may 29 with a forged syrian 
passport and says he is mohammed hamdan an officer in the military 
wing of the palestine liberation organization 
a plo diplomat based in athens told the court his organization 
believes that the american evidence and charges are false we know 
he is hamdan a soldier since 1967 and an officer in our army 
moustafa batik a second secretary at the plo mission in athens 
said i dont believe he had anything to do with the bombing 
defense lawyers argued the greek constitution forbids the 
extradition of foreigners prosecuted for their actions as freedom 
fighters 
but on oct 10 a lower court approved the extradition and said 
sending rashid to the united states was not unconstitutional 
a supreme court decision to extradite the palestinian would have 
to be approved by justice minister agamemnon koutsogiorgas before it 
can be carried out 
police believe rashid may also be linked to the attack on the 
city of poros cruise ship july 11 that killed nine people and 
injured 98 
american officials claim rashid also was involved in the 1986 
bombing of a twa jetliner over southern greece that killed four 
americans the twa blast is not mentioned in the extradition request

workers in two shipyards went on strike 
tuesday in support of the doomed lenin shipyard and they defied an 
appeal by solidarity leader lech walesa to go back to work 
walesa meanwhile said he might begin talks with the government 
even without receiving a guarantee by the authorities for the 
continued operation of the yard the birthplace of the banned trade 
union 
several hundred impatient young workers began strikes tuesday 
morning at the wisla and repair shipyards in gdansk to protest the 
scheduled dec 1 closing of the lenin shipyard 
strikers said they had waited long enough for the authorities to 
start talks promised to consider the banned unions future 
this is a warning to the authorities that we want the 
government to set about talks right away said jan stanecki 
strike leader at the 1000worker wisla yard which makes yachts and 
small craft 
stanecki said 400500 workers at the yard supported the strike 
as evening fell some strikers huddled over fires at the gates 
roasting sausages and half a dozen police vans drove up to seal off 
the shipyard temperatures were around freezing 
about 150 strikers at the 4500worker repair shipyard also vowed 
to stay off the job to the end they said 
through emissaries walesa urged the strikers to end the 
protests he said there was time to solve the lenin shipyard problem 
and that strikes could hinder resolution of the more pressing issues 
of the talks with the authorities and solidaritys future 
walesa spoke with management of the lenin yard tuesday and was 
told that its liquidation could take two years or more the 
information has convinced him not to demand an immediate reversal of 
the decision he said 
at first we had one month now we have two years he said 
we will fight for it the shipyard and we will save it but the 
blade is not at our throats we have time and we can talk about 
the shipyard later 
but walesa said that for the climate for talks with the 
government to improve officials must make good on promises to 
reinstate about 100 coal miners in southern poland fired for 
striking in august 
walesa said he would not allow interference in the composition of 
solidaritys delegation to the talks 
the government proposed the talks during the august strikes 
polands worst wave of labor unrest in seven years 
walesa agreed to end the strikes after the government promised 
that solidaritys future could be on the agenda for discussion as 
well as broader issues of political and economic reform 
government objections to longtime solidarity advisers adam 
michnik and jacek kuron as part of the solidarity delegation have 
stalled the talks and the union views the government decision to 
close the lenin yard as a provocation the government says the 
shipyard is being closed because it was losing money 
at a rally at the lenin shipyard walesa said he would like to 
start talks with authorities immediately at a later news 
conference he said strikes would not be advantageous now and he 
indicated that he could lose control of the situation if strikes 
spread 
i dont want to go on strike i want to solve the problems of 
the round table and of the solidarity trade union not to get the 
country into deeper crisis he said 
walesa appeared annoyed that the strikes had started and said he 
might resign if workers did not follow his decisions 
perhaps if strikes spread i will be ready to resign he 
said if they dont follow my decisions it means i am losing my 
control 
walesa sent jacek merkel one of the senior solidarity leaders in 
gdansk to the repair shipyard to persuade workers to end their 
protest action later workers at the gate said the decision to 
strike was their own and they planned to continue 
we will stay to the end we waited two months and that was 
enough to get the roundtable talks started we cant wait any 
longer said one worker who did not want to give his name 
the strikes in august were not finished we believe other 
enterprises and other regions will join us if we dont win now the 
next generation of young people will do it said stanecki at the 
wisla yard 
in warsaw government spokesman jerzy urban repeated statements 
that the decision to close the lenin shipyard was final and 
irreversible he said workers would benefit in the longrun from 
more efficient use of state resources 
however urban praised walesa for not following through on a 
threat to declare a nationwide strike alert tuesday 
urban at a news conference said walesas forebearance showed 
reason and realism we are learning democracy

she then checked into howard university hospital where she was 
listed in critical condition after undergoing a series of tests that 
revealed a dangerously low blood potassium level her condition was 
later upgraded to serious 
hospital spokesman norman brooks said fennelly 39 would likely 
survive 
she looked weak but she was conscious brooks said 
she is not in great shape said mitch snyder founder of the 
shelter her veins are completely shot and she has no blood 
pressure 
three hours after fennelly ate her first meal since september 
seven other activists including snyder ended similar fasts snyder 
said the protest was staged to get congress to restore the 75 
percent of the nations housing budget that has been cut over the 
past seven years and in general to draw attention to the plight of 
the homeless 
we did what we believe is right snyder said we arent 
concerned about the impact we just hope something will happen 
snyder whose life story was told in a network television movie 
has fasted numerous times to protest the conditions that homeless 
people endure fennelly snyders longtime companion lost more than 
40 pounds during the fast which was designed to end on election day 
a week ago snyder conceded that the groups fasting tactics 
might seem a bit crazy to some yeah its nuts that some people 
have to do this in order to get housing for people and shelter for

a delegation of estonians headed to moscow on 
tuesday to complain about president mikhail s gorbachevs 
constitutional reforms baltic activists said 
representatives of the peoples front in the baltic republics of 
lithuania latvia and estonia complain the reforms are a step 
backward in their drive for greater autonomy 
historians representatives of the peoples front all the 
people say its worse than the stalin constitution of 1934 felix 
undusk an editor for staterun estonian television and official of 
the peoples front said in a telephone interview from tallinn the 
estonian capital 
he said two members of the estonian peoples front left for 
moscow on tuesday evening along with communist party and government 
officials to attend a wednesday meeting on the topic at the 
presidium of the supreme soviet 
the presidium is the soviet unions collective presidency and 
gorbachev is its chairman 
undusk said he understood that representatives of five other 
republics were called to the meeting but that could not be 
confirmed 
in riga latvia a spokesman for that republics peoples front 
said representatives from latvia lithuania and estonia gathered for 
a oneday meeting tuesday to determine their response to the 
proposed constitutional changes 
the latvia organization has come out strongly against them 
latvian spokesman janis dinevich said the results of the meeting 
at the headquarters of the latvian creative unions would not be 
known before wednesday morning 
the constitutional reforms create a new national legislature and 
a powerful presidency changes gorbachev proposed in june to the 
communist party conference in moscow 
but the estonian and latvian peoples fronts have condemned the 
plan saying it removes their constitutional right to secede from 
the soviet union and shifts control of the economy and other 
aspects of the republics life to the central government 
the peoples front organizations that sprang up in the baltics 
earlier this year have been striving for just the opposite greater 
local control and autonomy from moscow some members privately say 
their eventual goal is independence from moscow 
top soviet officials generally have praised the peoples front as 
a healthy outgrowth of gorbachevs effort to restructure soviet 
society and encouragement of greater openness 
but gorbachevs top politburo adviser alexander n yakovlev was 
quoted in an interview late last month as saying moscow would not 
permit them to take any major steps toward independence 
the traditionally westwardlooking baltic states were independent 
after the 1917 bolshevik revolution until 1940 when soviet tanks 
rolled in on the basis of a secret agreement between the soviet 
union and nazi germany that carved eastern europe into spheres of 
influence

a small womens college launched a 
cookbook project a year ago with hopes of bringing in 1 million but 
is now stuck with 94000 copies of the book and a 400000 bill from 
the printers 
the cookbook compiled by officials of our lady of the elms 
college in this connecticut river city included more than 400 
recipes many contributed by local and state politicians 
the roman catholic school had planned to use the money raised for 
student financial aid and to bring some attention to the 750student 
college founded in 1928 by the sisters of st joseph 
college officials ordered 100000 copies printed but since last 
fall they have sold only 6000 copies at 10 a copy 
sister mary dooley college president was attending board 
meetings of the association for independent colleges and 
universities and could not be reached for comment tuesday sister 
mary lou lacey director of public relations said no other college 
officials would have any comment on the cookbook 
earlier sister dooley told new england monthly magazine that 
we probably did make a mistake in overordering she then 
provided the magazine with the telephone number at the college at 
which orders could be placed theyre very attractive she said 
of the cookbooks 
thomas d murphy jr chairman of the board of trustees who 
earlier had said a special committee has been established to 
examine all possibilities including going outside the state and 
country to market the book declined further comment tuesday 
the chicopee attorney said that he and other trustees have been 
instructed by their lawyer not to comment on the affair 
it is a very very sensitive issue for the college he said 
adding that lawyers for the college and the printer were attempting 
to resolve the matter of the bill and i would hate to say anything 
that would thwart those efforts 
earl alpert an attorney for the printer michael j omalley a 
former trustee of the college said that his client took the job on 
credit and is now looking for his 400000 he has received 
nothing of consequence from the college on the bill alpert said 
alpert said college officials initially wanted to order more 
copies and omalley talked them down to 100000

the new director of the states police 
training program that has been blamed for the death of a cadet vowed 
tuesday to have a proposal for totally revamped training ready by 
months end 
i have attended a number of police funerals and never have i 
felt the depth of feeling as in that church and outside peter w 
agnes jr said after the services monday for cadet timothy shepard 
25 as the bishop joseph maguire of springfield said in his 
eloquent message we cant miss the opportunity to use this 
tragedy 
we have a great need to demonstrate to the public quickly and 
in a most decisive way possible that the training programs will be 
made safe and the best they can be agnes said in a telephone 
interview from his boston office 
agnes assistant secretary of public safety took over the 
criminal justice training council following the resignation last 
week of director gary egan shepard of pittsfield died the same day 
he had lingered for 44 days and undergone a liver transplant 
after collapsing with heat stroke on the first day of training at 
the states agawam police training academy 
state attorney general james shannon has sought an inquest into 
shepards death to determine whether criminal charges should be 
brought against state police instructors he blamed the rigorous day 
of stress training including punishment laps and pushups and 
inadequate water for the hospitalization of shepard and 15 other 
cadets out of the class of 50 
after he was named agnes outlawed the use of physical activity 
as punishment and asked for the resignation of agawam director earl 
harrington when harrington declined to quit agnes transferred him 
and began dismissal proceedings 
we will not teach someone to cope with stress by putting them 
under stress we will do it by giving them the skills and 
reinforcement they need agnes said tuesday 
we want the people who graduate and become police officers to 
continue a lifelong regimen of physical fitness we dont want them 
to think of pushups and situps as some part of hazing or a hellish 
experience 
hundreds of pittsfield residents unable to squeeze inside the 
church silently lined the street outside during shepards funeral 
monday many said they did not know the young man but were outraged 
by his death 
agnes said tuesday that he planned to have an outline for the new 
curriculum ready for the councils nov 30 meeting it could be 
launched as a pilot program beginning in january 
it would be a terrible mistake to put this on hold and study it 
for a year agnes said

the scope of a key federal antiracketeering 
law was at issue tuesday when the supreme court was urged to revive 
a lawsuit by minnesota customers against northwestern bell telephone 
co 
this case involved bribery over five years lawyer mark 
reinhardt of st paul contended 
he told the justices that a federal lawsuit under the racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act or rico should not be 
blocked just because a public utility rather than the mafia 
allegedly paid the bribes 
but john d french of minneapolis a lawyer for northwestern 
bell said rico is aimed at thwarting organized crime and should not 
be used against otherwise legitimate businesses accused of fraud 
the law as interpreted by the nations highest court in a 1985 
decision provides a broad right to file private lawsuits 
today it is not unusual to find at least one rico claim in 
lawsuits involving virtually any business dispute such businesses 
as american express co ef hutton amp co and lloyds of london 
have been accused of racketeering in lawsuits invoking rico 
and the stigma attached to being linked in public court documents 
to alleged racketeering has proved to be powerful leverage for 
outofcourt settlements 
winners of rico lawsuits may collect triple damages and lawyers 
fees both of which generally are not available under state 
antifraud laws 
the minnesota phone customers have accused northwestern bell of 
bribing state public utility officials they say the company began 
in 1980 trying illegally to win rate increases by offering gifts 
employment and other favors to members of the minnesota public 
utilities commission 
their suit was thrown out by a federal judge and the dismissal 
was upheld by the 8th us circuit court of appeals last year 
the appeals court ruled that the phone companys customers failed 
to allege a continuing pattern of racketeering activity required 
to make a case under rico 
a single fraudulent effort or scheme is insufficient ground 
for a suit the appeals court said adding that the dismissed 
lawsuit alleges no more than a series of fraudulent acts committed 
in furtherance of a single scheme 
french urged the justices to uphold the 8th circuit courts 
ruling stating that the allegations against northwestern bell 
involve no threat of organized crime infiltrating legitimate 
business 
noting that the states attorney general is investigating past 
rate proceedings involving the phone company and other legal action 
french said exposing northwestern bell to rico liability is not 
needed 
reinhardt however argued that legitimate businesses that engage 
in fraudulent acts forfeit the right to call themselves 
legitimate 
he also challenged frenchs contention that reviving the 
minnesota lawsuit will add dramatically to the growing number of 
rico lawsuits being filed reinhardt said rico lawsuits represent 85 
of the 23000 new federal lawsuits filed each month 
theres been no opening of the floodgates he said 
the reagan administration in a friendofthecourt brief 
submitted last may sided with the phone customers in urging the 
justices to interpret the law broadly and reinstate the lawsuit 
the courts decision is expected by july 
the case is hj inc vs northwestern bell 871252

soviet dissident andrei sakharov underwent 
cardiovascular tests tuesday at massachusetts general hospital to 
determine if he needs to be given a pacemaker before he returns to 
the soviet union 
a spokesman for the 67yearold physicist and nobel laureate 
making his first visit to the west said there was no immediate word 
on the results of the tests 
sakharov has kept up a taxing schedule since arriving sunday and 
appears to be in generally good health but he has chronic angina 
or chest pain and is believed to have suffered a minor stroke three 
years ago when soviet authorities force fed him during a hunger 
strike 
if doctors determine that he needs a pacemaker to regulate his 
heartbeat he will return to boston for surgery later this month 
after visiting washington and new york and may extend his stay in 
the united states by a few days said matthew bannister sakharovs 
spokesman 
implantation of a pacemaker usually requires a twoday hospital 
stay 
sakharovs soninlaw efrem yankelevich said last week that 
pacemakers are not generally available in the soviet union 
sakharovs wife physician yelena bonner said in a june 1985 
letter to relatives in the united states that he had suffered an 
arterial spasm or a stroke and lost consciousness when 
authorities held his nose and forced liquid down his throat in an 
attempt to end a hunger strike 
sakharov reportedly had gone without food for several weeks to 
protest the soviet governments refusal to allow bonner to travel 
abroad for medical treatment the authorities relented and allowed 
her to travel to boston for heart bypass surgery in january 1986 
joshua rubenstein a specialist on soviet dissidents for amnesty 
international said sakharov also was weakened by a prior hunger 
strike in 1981 that 18day fast led the soviets to allow his 
stepsons fiancee liza alekseyeva to come to the united states to 
marry the stepson alexei semyonov 
but it wasnt just the hunger strikes themselves that caused 
the damage rubenstein said it was the psychological pressure 
the isolation being force fed the stroke being force fed is a 
form of torture after all 
sakharov himself has said little about his heart ailment asked 
at a news conference monday about his health he said only that it 
hasnt changed either way recently 
sakharov spent almost seven years in internal exile in the 
industrial city of gorky which is closed to foreigners he was 
banished there in january 1980 for his outspoken opposition to 
soviet intervention in afghanistan and was called back to moscow by 
mikhail gorbachev in december 1986 
sakharovs living conditions in gorky were difficult and he 
frequently had to carry around a 30pound bag with his possessions 
according to rubenstein 
sakharov is scheduled to travel to new york on friday for a 
luncheon sponsored by the union of concerned scientists he is to go 
to washington on saturday for a board meeting of the international 
foundation for the survival and development of humanity of which he 
is a director

oil well equipment pulled from an ashland oil 
inc field and found to be coated with lowlevel radioactive silt 
will be stored until some agency establishes guidelines for its 
disposal company officials said 
the muddy silt on equipment recovered from the martha oil field 
contains small amounts of naturally occurring radioactive minerals 
including uranium and does not pose a health hazard ashland 
officials said 
however workers at the field since august have worn dosimeters 
to measure exposure to radiation 
company officials said no attempt has been made to keep the 
problem a secret although as of last week the company had not told 
martha residents about the radiation 
weve been very aboveboard with what weve found said roger 
schrum an ashland spokesman 
edsel moore director of the state division for radiation and 
product safety said reports indicated lowlevel radioactivity that 
would pose no danger to area residents or people driving past the 
storage site 
there are no state or federal regulations regarding naturally 
occurring radioactive materials on in oilwell equipment 
the radioactive silt was discovered by ashland exploration inc 
a subsidiary of ashland oil while plugging 1432 oil wells that 
have polluted ground water in martha a small community in lawrence 
county in eastern kentucky 
the contaminated pipes and other drilling equipment are being 
stored on ashland land about a halfmile from a state highway 
no signs indicate the presence of radioactive material but 
ashland officials say access to the property is controlled by a 
clearly marked private bridge across blaine creek 
state officials said they have no reason not to take ashlands 
word for the radiation levels inspectors have been instructed to 
go down sometime the next time were in the area so we can say 
weve been there for our own edification said don hughes 
manager of the radiation control branch of the state cabinet for 
human resources 
l max scott a louisiana state university nuclear scientist 
hired by ashland exploration told workers that if they were to lie 
on the contaminated pipes 10 hours a day for 200 days they would 
receive a dose of radiation equal to one dental xray 
scott told the company to stockpile the material until the 
nuclear regulatory commission publishes guidelines for disposing of 
it 
nrc officials have said it may take two years to produce such 
guidelines 
the radiation problem was discovered a year ago

leaders prince norodom sihanouk and son sann of the anticommunist 
khmer peoples national liberation front their talks ended tuesday 
they said the new commission will be based in the former 
cambodian embassy building in paris and would include three to six 
representatives from each group 
the radical communist khmer rouge which has the largest 
guerrrilla force in cambodia did not participate in the talks but 
the three said it would be invited to send representatives to the 
commission 
the khmer rouge had been invited to join in the talks here but 
the three other leaders rejected the organizations proposed envoy 
saying he was not qualified for a summit meeting the khmer 
rouge had said it would send ok saukun a delegate to the un 
educational scientific and cultural organization 
in a joint statement the three men said they supported calling an 
international conference on cambodia and were prepared to meet again 
in france next year 
no date was set for that meeting but sihanouks son prince 
norodom ranariddh told reporters it would not be before september 
ranariddh said some means had to be found to include the khmer 
rouge in the negotitiations on cambodias future despite its brutal 
rule from 1975l979 
we shouldnt drive the khmer rouge into the forest ranariddh 
said to exclude the khmer rouge would be to pass from a war 
against vietnamese occupation to a civil war 
the khmer rouge came to power in the spring of 1975 defeating 
the usbacked government hundreds of thousands of cambodians 
perished as the khmer rouge purged opponents and forced millions of 
people from the cities in an effort to establish an agrarian 
communist society

president reagans national security adviser 
paraphrasing one of vice president george bushs campaign phrases 
said tuesday it is uncertain whether mikhail gorbachevs reform 
policies will lead to a kinder gentler soviet union 
in a speech prepared for delivery to the american stock exchange 
conference on us perspectives lt gen colin l powell said the 
united states may applaud the soviet leaders appraisal of his 
countrys problems but must nevertheless reserve judgment on both 
his economic goals and how he intends to achieve them 
it is the failure of past soviet policies because there was 
effective resistance to their aggression that led the soviets to 
reassess those policies powell said 
will perestroika to paraphrase words used in our election 
campaign lead to a kinder gentler soviet union he asked what 
advice should the us government give its businessmen who wish to 
compete in the soviet union 
these are tough questions he said we cannot forget that 
our overall relationship continues to be both competitive and 
adversarial this is unlikely to change within our lifetimes 
while the soviet leaders are still leninists who think very 
much in political terms it should be possible and may even be 
desirable to improve economic relations powell said 
nevertheless he said a system of centralized state control 
and planning is inconsistent with both vigorous entrepreneurship and 
political freedom 
even under perestroika the soviets have recognized this truth 
only partially powell said 
it is wrong to think that economic relations by themselves will 
moderate soviet foreign policy he added 
powell took issue with what he called a groundswell of opinion 
that says help gorbachev sell him whatever he needs 
the soviet union shows no evidence as yet of changing its basic 
military force structure its emphasis on expanding and modernizing 
its weapons systems or its aggressive illegal program for 
acquiring strategic technologies he said 
until the soviets can establish convincingly that it has made 
significant changes in these areas it is not in our interest to 
change our policy 
some officials seem to be suggesting that we might even have an 
obligation to help ensure the success of perestroika the national 
security adviser said 
however he said it might be decades before the west has firm 
evidence that gorbachevs policies will lead to a more open 
peaceful and democratic society 
until we do those whose legitimate business it is to make 
profits through international trade will have to recognize national 
security guidelines he said 
asked whether he believes gorbachev aims at world domination by 
the soviet union powell said as a personal matter i dont think 
he does that i thin he is fully committed to a political philosophy 
that has that as its original and continuing goal but i think its 
a goal that he knows is not achievable 
he said one of his major recommendations to the new 
administration will be to seek more economic and security aid funds 
for countries of central and south america and for african 
countries principally below the sahara 
i am going to list it in my transition notes as a number one 
item for the next administration to engage the congress on he 
said 
asked whether he foresaw resumption of diplomatic relations with 
cuba he said not in the near future not without significant 
change in the nature of the regime

despite a series of crashes involving 
highperformance jet fighters the armed services enjoyed their 
safest aviation year in history in fiscal 1988 the pentagon said 
tuesday 
the navy marine corps and army each set individual records for 
aviation safety and the air force came close to matching its 
alltime best the pentagon added 
combined the four services flew their aircraft almost 73 
million hours during the year ending sept 30 experiencing 137 
socalled class a accidents that amounts to a rate of 188 mishaps 
per 100000 flying hours the standard military measurement 
a class a mishap is one in which there is either a fatality or 
damage exceeding 500000 to an aircraft 
the previous record for aviation safety was set by the four 
services a year ago when they reported a combined rate of 221 per 
100000 flying hours based on 164 serious mishaps 
the current performance reflects a 35 percent reduction in 
major accidents since 1982 with an increase of 49 percent in 
flying hours from 69 million to 727 million hours the pentagon 
said 
the number of fatalities reported by the air force marine corps 
and army declined from a total of 119 in fiscal 1987 to 103 in 
fiscal 1988 
the navy could not say how many aviators died in fiscal 1988 
said lt janet mescus 
the new fiscal year statistics were being ballyhooed at the 
pentagon on tuesday about the same time that an air force b1b 
bomber crashed near dyess air force base texas the crash was the 
second involving a production model of that new longrange bomber 
while the overall news was good the navy and air force each 
reported some problems in fiscal 1988 with one of their jet 
fighters the navy lost five f14 tomcats during the month of 
september alone and at least six in all for the year while the air 
force lost 23 f16 fighting falcons 
service officials said a month ago there was no common thread 
among those accidents 
on a service by service base the pentagon said the army set a 
new record safety rate of 184 serious mishaps per 100000 flying 
hours in fiscal 1988 the navys new record was 208 per 100000 
flight hours and the marine corps new record was 318 per 100000 
flying hours 
the air force experienced 163 serious mishaps per 100000 flying 
hours slightly worse that its alltime best of 153 set in fiscal 
1986 
setting aside the statistical rates the army experienced 32 
serious aviation accidents in fiscal 1988 compared with 38 in fiscal 
1987 the navy 37 compared with 49 the year before the marine 
corps 14 compared with 20 and the air force 54 compared with 57 
the army said there were 39 fatalities in its crashes compared 
with 42 in fiscal 1987 fortyeight individuals died in air force 
accidents in fiscal 1988 compared with 57 in fiscal 1987 and 16 
died in marine corps accidents compared with 20 the year before 
the army aircraft experiencing the worst accident rate was the 
vietnamera uh1 huey transport helicopter the army said 10 of 
those choppers crashed in fiscal 1988 compared with nine in fiscal 
1987 
the pentagon in a prepared statement said the military services 
managed to lower their accident rates despite increasing 
operational demands on aviators forcing them to fly faster 
lower and often in conditions of limited visibility 
it attributed the gains to the number of modern aircraft entering 
the inventory and to the fact that those aircraft more so than 
their predecessors have been engineered for safety from a very 
early point in the design cycle

antigun control groups and some us law 
enforcement officials are questioning the validity of a study that 
says the canadian city of vancouver is safer than seattle because of 
gun control laws 
a study to be published thursday in the new england journal of 
medicine concludes that the number of handgun deaths in vancouver 
british columbia 120 miles to the north between 1980 and 1986 was 
nearly onefifth that of seattle 
dr john henry sloan chief investigator for the study said 388 
homicides occurred in seattle during the study period while 204 
occurred in vancouver the number of gunrelated deaths in seattle 
was 139 compared with 25 for vancouver he said 
sloan 34 a researcher at the injury prevention research center 
at seattles harborview medical center stopped short tuesday of 
saying his findings prove seattles laxer handgun control laws cause 
more deaths but said it virtually explains it 
gun control activists were quick to seize the opportunity 
i think that the study clearly puts to rest the notion strong 
handgun control laws dont have an effect on levels of crime said 
susan whitmore spokeswoman for washington dcbased handgun 
control inc 
john hosford executive director of the seattlebased citizens 
committee for the right to keep and bear arms dismissed the study 
as a political ploy to help a gun control initiative on marylands 
ballot 
its not new research hosford said i dont think the 
study is valid since it doesnt take into account the cause and 
effect of many issues 
and dr paul blackman spokesman for the national rifle 
association in washington dc criticized the study for not 
looking at the period before vancouvers new gun control laws went 
into effect in 1978 
sloan said vancouvers laws were made stricter in 1978 but 
didnt change significantly 
in seattle handguns may legally be purchased for self defense 
after a 30day waiting period a permit can be obtained to carry a 
handgun as a concealed weapon recreational uses are minimally 
restricted 
in vancouver selfdefense is not considered a legal reason to 
purchase a handgun concealed weapons are not permitted and 
recreational use of handguns such as target shooting and collecting 
are regulated by the province the weapons may only be fired at a 
licensed shooting club 
in addition criminal offenses carry stricter penalties than in 
the united states said vancouver police sgt robert law 
hosford said that what seattle needs is not more gun control 
laws but stricter penalties for people convicted of crimes 
involving guns 
jim deschane commander of the seattle police west precinct said 
he believes the process of allowing people to carry handguns in the 
city is far too lax because police cant check applicants 
medical records 
dr stanley abrams a forensic psychologist who has been involved 
in investigations of serial murders in portland ore said easy 
availablity of guns can cause more deaths because it is 
psychologically more difficult for someone to use a knife to kill 
than to just shoot a gun 
people who use knives have to be more destructive its 
definitely more difficult to kill with a knife abrams said 
and since only 5 percent of murders are planned a person 
carrying a gun makes it that much more likely a murder will occur 
abrams said

the palestine national 
council will declare an independent palestinian state in 
israelioccupied land this month but delay announcing a provisional 
government a council official said tuesday 
the pnc will determine the proper time for announcing the 
provisional government and forming it said salim zaanoun deputy 
speaker of the 450member council which acts as a legislature for 
the palestine liberation organization 
it is to convene saturday in algiers to determine a new political 
strategy following king husseins july 31 decision to cut jordans 
administrative ties with the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
there have been reports for weeks that the pnc would declare an 
independent state in the west bank and gaza where an uprising 
against israeli occupation began dec 8 1987 among the 15 million 
palestinian residents israel captured the territories from jordan 
and egypt in the 1967 war 
israel has said it will not accept an independent palestinian 
state and gains by rightist parties in last weeks israeli 
elections have hardened positions 
in jerusalem israeli leaders told foreign minister giulio 
andreotti of italy the plo cannot be a party to peace talks until it 
recognizes israels right to exist andreotti arrived tuesday for a 
24hour visit in his capacity as chairman for november of the un 
security council 
andreotti told reporters he decided on the visit after plo chief 
yasser arafat asked him at a meeting last month to explore the 
possibilities of arabisraeli peace negotiations 
khaled hassan head of the palestinian councils foreign 
relations committee was quoted by the londonbased newsletter 
mideast mirror as saying the palestinian state would coexist with 
israel and a confederation with jordan is envisaged 
the mirror said bassam abu sharif a close aide to arafat told 
it the declaration of a state would be issued nov 15 and would mark 
national independence day for palestinians 
zaanoun said the proposed palestinian state will be ready to 
adopt a positive stand and exert all possible efforts to reach a 
peaceful solution to the arabisraeli struggle at an international 
peace conference 
asked about international recognition for such a state zaanoun 
said declaring an independent country does not need recognition 
but declaring a provisional government does and the palestinian 
leadership will take this into consideration 
he said contacts by the palestinian leadership show the 
majority of the world countries support the declaration of an 
independent palestinian state

famed celebrity divorce lawyer marvin 
mitchelson says a state bar investigation of his conduct is a 
witch hunt 
the bar is investigating complaints that he files frivolous legal 
appeals and mishandles his clients money 
there is no question this is a witch hunt mitchelson said 
monday as he emerged from a twohour mandatory conference with two 
bar prosecutors and a referee 
mitchelson 60 gained fame with his landmark palimony 
lawsuit on behalf of michelle triola marvin who sued her former 
livein boyfriend actor lee marvin in 1976 
mitchelson has since represented many celebrities and the wives 
and girlfriends of actors and sports stars he represented joan 
collins in her divorce earlier this year from peter holm and he 
counseled carrie leigh former playmate to playboy founder hugh 
hefner 
the bar which said it had more than 20 complaints about 
mitchelson contends the attorney failed to deposit clients funds 
in trust accounts charged unconscionable fees failed to 
perform promised work lied to a client and twice improperly asked 
a client to withdraw her complaint to the bar over the return of 
unearned fees 
mitchelson was represented at the meeting by arthur margolis who 
said mitchelson will face a disciplinary hearing probably in 
january since the allegations were not resolved at the conference

deathpenalty foes sang and prayed 
tuesday for convicted killer jeffrey joseph daugherty and his 
victims one day after the prisoner was executed in floridas 
electric chair 
meanwhile the florida supreme court issued stays of execution 
tuesday after hearing appeals by two other deathrow inmates 
scheduled to die thursday morning 
the court granted an indefinite stay for john marek who was 
sentenced to die for the june 1983 rape and strangulation of adella 
m simmons in broward county 
the justices also granted a temporary stay effective through 
noon monday to leo alexander jones who was sentenced to die for 
the sniper shooting of jacksonville police officer thomas j 
szafranski in may 1981 jones death warrant is effective through 
next wednesday and he could be executed if the supreme court or a 
federal court doesnt extend the stay 
the warrants issued for the two mens executions were originally 
good for the period nov 9 through nov 16 but none of the 19 
inmates executed since 1979 has died under their initial warrants 
six other inmates on floridas death row are scheduled to be 
electrocuted in the next two months 
about 35 clergy and other anticapitalpunishment activists 
gathered in the capitol rotunda for the protest tuesday they 
emphasized also that they were praying for daughertys four victims 
as well as daugherty and the other men florida has executed in the 
last decade 
our intention is not to diminish the gravity of his crimes 
jeffrey took the lives of four innocent human beings during an 
inexcusable crime spree and was deserving punishment said 
elizabeth dawson of the florida clearinghouse on criminal justice 
yet jeffrey did not deserve to die even at the hands of the 
state 
several protesters said daughertys execution originally 
scheduled for late last week was timed deliberately to take place 
close to election day and that gov bob martinez was playing 
politics with human life 
roberta christie a member of the tallahassee chapter of amnesty 
international a worldwide human rights group said the timing of 
the execution demonstrates that political leaders cynically use 
the death penalty to further their careers 
an aide to martinez said legal considerations not political 
factors played the only part in martinezs decision to sign 
daughertys second death warrant last month 
if you wanted to be cold about it and analyze it that way it 
was a terrible day politically because it got buried in the news 
said brian ballard director of operations for martinez 
daugherty 33 was electrocuted shortly after 5 pm monday for 
the march 1 1976 murder of lavonne patricia sailer a 48yearold 
hitchhiker from minnesota whom daugherty picked up in brevard county 
she was one of four people daugherty killed during a threeweek 
crime spree 
he also was under life sentences for the slayings of betty 
campbell 50 in volusia county carmen abrams 60 in flagler 
county and elizabeth shanks in hollidaysburg pa 
daugherty was the 103 person to be executed in the united states 
since the supreme court reinstated the death penalty in 1976

iraq joined iran tuesday in offering to begin 
immediately the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners captured 
during their 8yearold war 
but the foreign ministers of both countries made it clear after 
another meeting with un mediator jan eliasson that there was no 
progress in efforts to consolidate the truce that took effect aug 
20 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz told reporters after the 
4hour meeting that the two sides discussed how to proceed with 
implementation of the un ceasefire resolution 
he said discussions were continuing but indicated iraq opposes a 
fourpoint compromise proposed last month by un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar 
negotiations are stalled over border disputes 
perez de cuellars proposal seeks to gain a breakthrough by 
linking a military disengagement and the exchange of prisoners to 
iranian assurances to cease searching ships for warrelated cargo 
for iran and the dredging of the shattalarab estuary the 
shattalarab is iraqs only waterway to the persian gulf 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati of iran said after the joint 
session that the main problem is that iraq has not accepted the 
fourpoint plan of the secretarygeneral 
he said that iran independent of the negotiations and on the 
basis of an agreement with the international committee of the red 
cross was ready to begin returning sick and wounded iraqi prisoners 
tomorrow 
aziz speaking to reporters after a meeting with icrc officials 
said the repatriation could begin with the 411 sick and wounded 
iranians held by iraq and registered by the icrc and 1115 
registered iraqis held by iran 
icrc spokeswoman francoise derron confirmed those numbers of 
prisoners had been registered by the red cross but said since we 
have not been able to visit all pows we may assume there are more 
ill and injured prisoners 
the icrc has registered a total of 50182 iraqi prisoners in iran 
and 19284 iranians in iraq it has estimated that an additional 
2000030000 unregistered prisoners are held by each side 
on oct 21 iran said it would be willing to immediately 
repatriate sick and and injured pows on a reciprocal basis 
tuesday was the first time iraq said publicly that it would do the 
same 
ms derron said the icrc would not make a statement on the 
possible repatriation of pows until an agreement is concrete we 
are not going to comment in the middle of negotiations 
aziz said the repatriations should be started by each side at the 
same time in accordance with a proportion to be agreed upon 
he said the repatriation should not be used by iran as a 
pretext to block the comprehensive exchange operation in accordance 
with the geneva convention as more than 100000 pows from both 
sides still suffer from captivity

the soviet unions deployment of new 
weapons in afghanistan and the delay of its troop withdrawal may 
have more political than military significance western diplomatic 
sources said tuesday 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
soviets appeared to be pressing for a political solution of the war 
while trying to boost the morale of beleaguered afghan communists 
with a wonder weapon 
soviet forces on nov 1 rolled two ss1 scudb missiles on their 
massive launchers through the streets of kabul the afghan capital 
it was the first time they had been seen there 
rebel and western sources had reported a few days earlier the 
deployment of new soviet mig27 fighterbombers in western 
afghanistan 
last friday the soviet first deputy foreign minister alexander 
bessmertnykh said in moscow that his country had suspended its 
military withdrawal because of the current political situation in 
afghanistan 
but neither he nor other kremlin officials backed off the soviet 
commitment to complete the withdrawal by feb 15 
the soviet union agreed under a unmediated accord in april to 
remove its more than 100000 combat troops from afghanistan between 
may 15 1988 and feb 15 1989 un observers said the soviets met 
their promise to withdraw half of the force by aug 15 but that no 
major units have left since then 
the soviet announcement was not a surprise said one 
diplomatic source in islamabad 
there has been no evidence on the ground for preparation of 
further withdrawal for nearly three months now the announcement 
probably has more political than military significance 
another diplomatic source said the remaining soviet troops could 
be evacuated in a matter of weeks 
the soviet union sent troops into afghanistan in december 1979 to 
help the marxist government battle anticommunist rebels 
about nine scud missiles reportedly have been fired in 
afghanistan since nov 1 but there have been no reports of major 
damage 
the western sources said the missiles with a range of 100175 
miles are not suited for guerrilla warfare 
one source said the scud was designed as a nuclear delivery 
vehicle and is not a precision weapon the purpose of scud 
seems to be to bolster the morale of the regime with a wonder 
weapon 
afghanistans official news media said the afghan army acquired 
the missiles and new jet fighters to counter increases in us and 
pakistani arms deliveries to the rebels 
western diplomats said the latest developments reflect a 
worsening political and military situation for the afghan government 
one said he saw the developments more as a political maneuver 
designed to foster a political settlement than as a prelude to a 
soviet decision not to withdraw from afghanistan

arrested the exwife maid and gardener of jeanclaude paul the 
former army colonel who died over the weekend after eating a bowl of 
soup 
col georges valcin the portauprince police chief said the

israels supreme court criticized the army 
tuesday for overcrowding at its main prison for palestinian 
activists but rejected claims that detainees were being held in 
violation of international law 
in the arab village of taibe in northern israel residents 
angered by the demolition of 15 houses built without permits threw 
firebombs and stones at police who fired tear gas the itim news 
agency said 
it was the first serious riot by israeli arabs since january 
protests in solidarity with the 11month uprising of their 
palestinian brethren in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
in the occupied territories israeli soldiers shot and wounded 12 
palestinians including a 16yearold who was in serious condition 
with a plastic bullet in the head arab hospital officials said the 
army confirmed seven wounded in clashes but did not provide details 
underground palestinian leaders called for a general strike in 
the occupied lands wednesday to mark the beginning of the 12th month 
of the uprising at least 309 palestinians and 11 israelis have been 
killed since the uprising began last dec 8 
the supreme court rejected an appeal by 14 palestinians from the 
occupied territories held at the ketziot tent prison in israels 
southern negev desert 
the detainees had argued they were being held illegally because 
geneva conventions on human rights bar the transfer of prisoners 
across borders 
about 1700 prisoners are at ketziot including 1558 detained 
for up to six months without trial in administrative detention 
the united states has criticized administrative detention as a 
violation of due process 
in a 45page ruling chief justice meir shamgar singled out 
administrative detentions noting 28 percent of administrative 
detentions have been overturned on appeal 
negating freedom without the approval of a judicial authority 
is a drastic and serious step which the law allows only where 
there are essential security concerns he wrote 
shamgar also appeared to criticize defense minister yitzhak rabin 
for scrapping a requirement in january that administrative detainees 
be seen by a judge within 96 hours of their arrest 
detainees have the right to appeal detention orders but urged 
the army to ensure that appeals are heard within three weeks of 
arrest 
shamgar who toured the ketziot in august wrote that complaints 
about overcrowding were justified 
the justices found 28 men into a tent at ketziot where inmates 
were forced to sleep pushed against each other with no room for 
personal belongings 
the court decision was expected to have little impact because the 
army said the number of prisoners has been sharply reduced in recent 
weeks 
in taibe arabs threw firebombs and stones at hundreds of police 
who responded with tear gas two police officers and an arab were 
injured and 13 people were detained israel radio reported 
taibe residents went on strike tuesday to protest mondays house 
demolitions 
in the west bank shantytown of jiftlic the army bulldozed about 
a dozen shacks of palestinian migrant workers in retaliation for a 
stabbing attack in which an israeli soldier was killed by an arab 
laborer monday the army said about 100 people were left homeless 
arab reports said 
jiftlic is about 25 miles northeast of jerusalem 
in haifa police detained a 27yearold american jewish woman who 
tried to smuggle weapons into the country israel radio reported it 
described the woman as a us citizen who had an apartment in 
jerusalem 
the woman whose name was not released was detained on monday 
after tax authorities found two sovietdesigned kalashnikov assault 
rifles a pistol and ammunition in her luggage it said 
the woman claimed she needed the weapons for selfdefense the

a b1 bomber the air forces most advanced 
strategic aircraft crashed tuesday and all four crew members 
ejected safely one man getting out seconds before impact officials 
said 
the crash was the third since the b1 began flying three years 
ago as the nations first new longrange bomber in more than 25 
years 
the crew members were taken to the dyess hospital and are in 
good condition said air force spokesman linda gellnere of dyess 
air force base where the longrange bomber was based the plane 
crashed about 330 pm about eight miles northwest of here 
lou paulsen of abilene who witnessed the crash said the plane 
appeared to be making a normal flight away from the base when smoke 
starting coming out a left engine as the craft was circling 
at first there was just a puff of smoke then fire said 
paulsen who was about two miles away it looked like it started 
to go out then it flared up big 
paulsen who is an air force reserve member said the pilot 
apparently abandoned hope of returning to dyess and decided to ditch 
the plane in an unpopulated area 
it banked back toward the left then they started ejecting 
said paulsen who was watching with his wife three chutes came 
out right after another then the plane started veering left into 
the country 
the last parachute came out seconds before the plane crashed in 
a ravine in an unpopulated area he said 
when it hit the plane exploded in a fireball 10 stories high 
white smoke could be seen for more than 20 miles filling the sky 
west of abilene witnesses said 
the crews dramatic escape was captured by a television film crew 
we looked out our window to the west and we saw a b1 aircraft 
with flames coming out of the back said joyce heiser of ktabtv 
in abilene we followed it with a camera it headed off to the 
north and the east 
the plane went down a couple of miles north of interstate 20 in 
an open field emergency and rescue vehicles were at the scene less 
than half an hour after the crash 
the base was the first in the country to get the b1 and is still 
the flight training center 
the b1 built by the rockwell international corp is the first 
new longrange bomber to be produced by the united states in more 
than 25 years 
the air force ordered 100 of the planes at a total cost of 27 
billion but lost one in an accident on sept 28 1987 at a 
training range in colorado when the bomber ran into a migrating 
pelican three aviators were killed in that accident 
before that accident a prototype of the new plane designated a 
b1b crashed in august 1984 at edwards air force base calif 
killing one person and injuring two 
the fourengine swingwing bomber is designed to fill the gap 
between the aging b52 and the b2 stealth bomber in the air 
force arsenal 
the plane has a maximum speed of about 1000 mph and a range of 
more than 7000 miles it is smaller than the b52 but capable of 
carrying more bombs and already holds a number of world aviation 
speed records for a plane of its size 
the b1b is designated as a lowaltitude penetrator meaning 
it is expected to fly at almost the speed of sound at altitudes of 
only 200 feet above the ground during a nuclear war the b1b would 
be the bomber expected to actually fly missions inside the soviet 
union 
the air force has been criticized over the past two years for its 
handling of the b1b program primarily because of acknowledged 
problems in developing the bombers radarjamming gear however the 
service insists the plane is still the best longrange bomber in the 
world

no one was seriously injured but 30 firefighters and six 
sheriffs employees were treated at hospitals for smoke inhalation 
said fire department spokesman dean kathey 
sheriff sherman block said narcotics particularly cocaine 
burned in the 45minute blaze authorities will conduct an inventory 
of the evidence to determine how much was lost he said 
the blaze began in a seventhfloor storage room that contained 
documents and narcotics seized as evidence in sheriffs department 
investigations said vince marzo a city fire department spokesman 
greg acevedo a fire dispatcher said officials were concerned 
that runoff water from the storage room might be contaminated by the 
narcotics evidence

national boy scout officials concede the 
slaughter of chickens and rabbits during a wilderness survival 
weekend should not have happened but say the organization will not 
ban the practice 
the disclosure that scouts were shown how to kill chickens and 
rabbits and then butcher them for eating raised the ire of 
animalrights activists who wanted the scouts to prohibit such 
training 
the killing techniques were demonstrated during a camping trip 
held sept 30 through oct 2 in perry county afterward five to 10 
scouts tried it themselves beating the animals on the head with 
sticks slitting their throats and hanging the carcasses upside down 
to drain 
we agree with you completely that the incident involving the 
rabbits and chickens should not have happened national boy scout 
spokesman frank hebb wrote last week to edward j blotzer jr of 
the pittsburgh office of the humane society 
for 78 years as a part of our training we have demonstrated 
the sixth point of the scout law a scout is kind he does not hurt 
or kill harmless things without reason and we hear about it when 
there are isolated violations hebb wrote 
g john giba who did not attend the camp but is scoutmaster for 
one of the troops involved said the killings were done properly and 
without malice 
but george cave president of transspecies unlimited a 
statewide animalrights group said the killings were unnecessary 
cruel and not good training for young boys 
we object to desensitizing children to the killing of animals 
for no good purpose he said 
hebb said in a telephone interview monday that the boy scouts 
will not change current policy or discipline the scout leaders who 
led the exercises 
we do not endorse what they did but i dont think that theres 
going to be any action because i think that what they did at the 
time was perfectly legitimate within our policies he said 
cave said he was disappointed with the boy scout leaderships 
lack of action on the issue 
naturally were very disappointed in this decision or the lack 
of one cave said

national convention last summer dole said of the indiana senator 
you could find better qualified people

anything critical of dan quayle hes an outstanding young man but 
lets face it if youre looking for the ablest person i assume 
that george bush could have found others 
but dan quayle has done a good job hes going to be a good

mates after his own bid for the gop presidential nomination failed 
on another subject the senate republican leader said on nbc 
tuesday night that the deficit and longterm health care will be at 
the top of congress agenda next year 
he said bushs promise not to raise taxes may be difficult to 
keep if that means ruling out all revenue sources 
my view is that we dont have to touch tax rates on individuals 
or corporations but when you rule out everything user fees 
excise taxes any kind of a tax that might even support a program 
thats going to be difficult to do 
but george bush has said no new taxes ill be willing to 
help him in that effort and well see what the democrats have to

would help pull mutz through in indiana where bayh was favored by a 
margin that had narrowed dramatically in the closing days of the

1980 
mutz claimed credit for the states prosperity and argued that 
bayh was too inexperienced and saw the governors office as one 
more jewel for his political crown the democrat argued that mutz 
should be held responsible for the two biggest tax increases in 
state history and that he negotiated deals that gave away too many 
economic development incentives to foreign companies

bush who first ran for the white house a decade ago and lost in 
the 1980 primaries to reagan awaited the nations verdict in 
houston he said no predictions as he voted earlier in the day 
and described and described the election as a referendum on a 
philosophy a way of life and then awaited returns with family 
members in his hotel suite 
dukakis campaigned even as the vote totals mounted its a 
fight to the finish a cliffhanger he said it reminds me of 
1960 when john f kennedy and richard m nixon battled down to 
the finish dukakis said before concluding a final round of tv 
interviews fed back to the battleground states 
but as the night wore on it looked less and less like 1960 and 
more like four of the five previous white house elections that ended 
in republican victory 
bentsen said on abc that republicans did a job on michael 
dukakis with the negative adsand they distorted his record to a 
remarkable degree bentsen was a cinch to win a new term in the 
senate from texas no matter which side claimed the white house 
quayle wanted the last laugh after being on the receiving end of 
endless democratic jokes and sharp public scrutiny dole wasnt the 
only republican who expressed concern that the 41yearold indiana 
senator was not seasoned enough to be vice president 
but for all the controversy quayle provoked electionplace polls 
suggested this election held to form with the running mates swaying 
few votes 
democrats were renewing majorities in both the house and senate 
that will comprise the 101st congress the two parties vied for 
gains in 12 gubernatorial contests races that held significance for 
a nationwide redistricting that takes place after the 1990 census 
democrats held a 5446 edge in the old senate and an overwhelming 
255177 advantage in the old house with three vacant seats 
democratic senators winning reelection included edward kennedy 
in massachusetts paul sarbanes in maryland james sasser of 
tennessee daniel patrick moynihan in new york and don riegle in 
michigan howard metzenbaum in ohio jeff bingaman in new mexico and

spirited challenge from pete dawkins to hold his new jersey seat 
robert byrd of west virginia also won as did maines george 
mitchell one of three men who hope to succeed him as senate 
majority leader 
republican senators reelected were richard lugar in indiana 
john danforth of missouri john heinz of pennsylvania william roth 
in delaware and john chafee in rhode island 
there were tougher races of course 
republicans hoped to spring an upset in montana against john

democratic millionaire herbert kohl led state sen susan 
engeleiter in early returns in wisconsin rep mike lowry battled

political pros on both sides agreed the house would live up to 
its reputation as a citadel of security for lawmakers seeking 
reelection dozens of democrats and republicans had either no 
opposition or only minor party rivals 
democratic speaker jim wright of texas was among them even 
though he is under investigation by the house ethics committee gop

superiority in the statehouses and bayh and caperton got them off 
to a fast start

typhoon skip killed at least 73 people 
and left thousands homeless as it swept across the central 
philippines into the south china sea relief agencies said wednesday 
the death toll brought to more than 300 the number of people 
known to have been killed by three storms that have ravaged the 
philippines in two weeks 
late tuesday skip was about 260 miles southwest of manila and was 
moving westnorthwest at 19 mph the government weather service said 
its peak winds had weakened to 88 mph compared to 108 mph when 
it came ashore monday in the central island of samar 
the storms center moved across the islands about 100 miles south 
of manila sparing the capital much damage 
but the office of civil defense reported seven people drowned in 
floods in the manila suburb of pasig 
the social services department reported at least 1 million people 
were affected by the typhoon meaning their homes or property were 
destroyed or damaged the office of civil defense said more than 
30000 people were homeless 
red cross officials said 36 people were killed on palawan where 
skip triggered widespread flooding on the southern part of the 
remote island 
the red cross said the next hardesthit area was camarines sur 
province on the southeastern edge of luzon island where 19 people 
were killed in landslides and a tornado triggered by the typhoon 
the other deaths reported were seven drownings on panay island a 
person electrocuted by a downed power line and three drownings on 
marinduque island and in agusan del norte province 
casualty reports from philippine relief agencies often conflict 
because of differences in reporting and in standards for accounting 
for deaths the red cross reports casualties only if they can 
identify the victims by name 
the overall death toll of 73 included seven in manilas pasig 
suburb and eight on panay island which were reported by the 
government office of civil defense but not by the red cross 
typhoon ruby struck the philippines on oct 24 and tropical storm 
tess swept through the visayas islands on saturday 
officials said typhoon ruby killed at least 181 people on land 
and at least 64 others perished and more than 200 are missing from 
the passenger ship dona marilyn that sank they said the tropical 
storm caused floods that killed 11 people

despite vatican denials theologians 
here say pope john paul ii is out to discipline the predominantly 
progressive and independentminded church in the worlds largest 
roman catholic country 
jose queiroz a theologian and philosopher at sao paulos 
catholic university said in an interview the holy see has 
embarked on an offensive to force the brazilian church to follow the 
conservative positions he favors 
on oct19 the vatican officially denied reports published in 
the brazilian press of the existence of a socalled conservative 
offensive against brazilian bishops considered too progressive 
the pope repeatedly has stressed he wants the church to 
concentrate on its traditional role of spiritual salvation queiroz 
and other theologians say the pope seeks to curb the largely 
leftofcenter leaders of brazils church 
the pope recently appointed conservative cardinals to head two 
key brazilian archdioceses he is reported preparing to pull the rug 
out from under one of brazils most influential clergymen the 
outspoken and highly progressive archbishop of the city of sao 
paulo cardinal paulo evaristo arns 
theologians say the vatican plans to divide sao paulos huge 
archdiocese the largest in the world this would open the way for 
the appointment of new bishops who would toe the popes dogmatic 
line and it would undermine cardinal arns influence 
also irritating the pope is the growth of the activist liberation 
theology in brazil a grassroots theology based on jesus concern 
for the poor it promotes greater social political and economic 
awareness among poor people 
the vatican has said there is no place in the church for the 
politicalreligious cocktail promoted by some liberation theologians 
and has censured brazils leading exponents of that approach the 
rev leonardo boff and spanishborn bishop pedro casaldaliga 
a leading spokesman for the progressive wing of the church the 
most rev tomas balduino bishop of the city of goias said in a 
telephone interview 
the vatican is determined to restore the centralized and 
authoritarian structure of the church a structure which does not 
tolerate original thought or any divergence from the traditional 
doctrine of saving souls 
the most rev luciano cabral duarte archbishop of the 
northeastern city of aracaju and a conservative says the church in 
brazil was divided between those who remain faithful to the 
ecclesiastical institution such as christ created it and those who 
want a more modern church which would work as a democracy 
the second option is not valid because the church was never 
meant to be a democracy duarte said in a signed opinion column in 
the influential conservative newspaper o estado de s paulo the 
apostles were not elected by popular vote the church is a 
hierarchy 
queiroz said the conservative forces in the vatican are slowly 
but surely gaining ground 
this became very clear when the pope named cardinal lucas 
moreira neves as archbishop of the large northeastern city of 
salvador and cardinal jose freire falcao as archbishop of brasilia 
the capital 
he also sees in the rumored carving up of the arns archdiocese 
of sao paul a move to curtail the influence of the progressive wing 
of the church in brazil 
arns an ardent defender of liberation theology and human rights 
currently exercises his influence over an area inhabited by some 15 
million people 
according to the vaticans plan the archdiocese would be cut 
to just five districts concentrated in the citys metropolitan 
area queiroz said 
the rest of greater sao paulo inhabited by the kind of 
lowincome workers proliberation theology forces want to reach 
would be divided into four separate dioceses with their bishops 
named by the vatican 
arns has declined comments on the planned division of his 
archdiocese 
the most rev boaventura kloppenburg bishop of the city of novo 
hamburgo in the southern state of rio grande do sul and another 
recognized conservative welcomed the division of sao paulos 
archdiocese for the same reasons progressives condemned it 
in a phone interview he said the vatican was concerned with 
brazils liberation theologians who refuse to follow the popes 
guidelines and who adopt positions that are irreconcilable with the 
official doctrine 
kloppenburg said it was evident and obvious that by 
naming new conservative cardinals and by splitting up cardinal arns 
archdiocese the pope will reassert his authority over brazils 
church 
the churchs goal is to bring about mankinds spiritual 
salvation and not as liberation theology would have it create a 
social consciousness among the people kloppenburg said 
queiroz says there are reactionary forces inside the vatican 
trying to nullify the churchs active participation in the social 
economic and political problems of the country in this sense they 
are trying to restrict and police the actions of the progressive 
clergy

many american jews foresee new efforts to stiffen

religious parties 
we strongly urge the leadership of both major parties not 
to use the law of return as a bargaining chip to form a new 
coalition says robert k lifton president of the american jewish

orthodox jewish parties want the law admitting jews limited in

which are stricter than those for conservative and reform jews

leveraged buyout funds have been cropping up like 
summer corn stalks but whether there will be a prolonged harvest of 
profits for investors is another matter altogether 
by some estimates there are over 100 funds in existence more 
than half of which were established in the past five years to cash 
in on the latest craze in takeovers 
just a few years ago big leveraged buyouts were a scarce 
commodity in 1981 15 buyouts were announced worth at least 25 
million each for a total of 31 billion by 1987 the figure jumped 
to 114 such buyouts totaling 591 billion according to russell 
reynolds associates inc a new york recruiting firm 
in the past year alone among those to announce their intentions 
to enter the fray by creating funds that invest in lbos are 
manufacturers hanover citibank general electric credit corp and 
merrill lynch amp co which is specializing in a fund for small 
investors among others 
lbo funds attract investors ranging from wellheeled individuals 
to pension funds to university endowments often with the promise of 
returns as high as 50 percent with such strong backing lbo funds 
have been able to amass 25 billion to 30 billion in assets which 
is enough to leverage 10 times that amount 
but the proliferation of these funds is putting pressure on 
managers to turn deals 
theres no question that when you buy an lbo fund you are 
buying because you want those funds to make takeover offers and be 
part of offers said hugh johnson first vice president at first 
albany corp 
the returns in many lbo funds have been substantial so as 
result it has driven a lot of expectations of returns for those 
funds in future he added 
despite the availability of money for financing most lbo funds 
find it challenging to find good deals at appropriate prices said 
steven b potter a managing director at russell reynolds 
so much money chasing deals is bound to boost the price of 
transactions and cut into profit margins ultimately there is the 
danger that these funds may not be able to rake in the doubledigit 
returns they advertise 
johnson said he believes investors have developed expectations 
well beyond what is realistically possible that means as johnson 
notes that maybe not so far down the road there are going to be 
some disappointments 
in the case of rjr nabisco inc three potential bidders have 
emerged including two major leveraged buyout firms the rjr deal 
has pretty much carved up wall street shearson lehman hutton inc 
and salomon bros inc are working with rjr managers while lbo 
powerhouse kohlberg kravis roberts amp co has its own entourage of 
backers for its 207 billion bid 
rival buyout firm forstmann little amp co also is considering a 
bid which could push the price tag of the deal even higher 
analysts already are concerned that any higher offer could make the 
deal financially unfeasible 
in a leveraged buyout a portion of a companys assets are used 
to finance the acquisition the deal also relies on taking on a 
substantial amount of debt which typically forces managers to sell 
off assets and slash overhead to meet their obligations to banks and 
bondholders 
more troubling than rjr is the case of campeau corps takeover 
of federated department stores inc after investors looked askance 
at the 115 billion in junk bonds needed to finance the deal 
campeau scurried to restructure the package to make it more 
attractive 
if campeau or its financial backers lose money on the deal 
johnson said financiers will probably take a harder look at lbos 
large pension funds and other investors will withdraw from those 
funds and then the acquisitions could dry up he said

four months after archbishop 
marcel lefebvre was excommunicated from the roman catholic church 
his traditionalist supporters seem largely undeterred by papal 
warnings that they will face the same punishment if they do not 
break with him 
the titular head of lefebvres st pius x fraternity of priests 
says a total of 15 priests and 18 seminarians less than 10 percent 
have left the movement since the rebel prelate consecrated four 
traditionalist bishops june 30 in defiance of the vatican 
lefebvre and his followers say that the church has embarked on a 
course of autodestruction since the second vatican council of 
196265 they reject many reforms introduced then including the 
replacement of latin with the vernacular in the liturgy and 
relations with protestant churches 
the archbishop argues that he continues to recognize papal 
authority but that the consecrations were a legitimate emergency 
act to save the church and that therefore the excommunications were 
invalid 
the defections leave 210 priests in the fraternity and 255 
students in the fraternitys six theological schools in australia 
the united states france switzerland and west germany according 
to the rev franz schmidberger 
percentagewise the number who left us is small but every 
defection hurts us of course schmidberger who succeded lefebvre 
as superior general of the fraternity in 1984 said in an interview 
it hurts particularly at a time when we need more and more priests 
to help us in our work 
that need is growing he said because of a growing attendance at 
traditionalist services in the churches chapels and other places of 
worship founded by the fraternity 
we estimate that attendance at holy mass celebrated in our 530 
centers worldwide has increased between 5 to 10 percent since the 
consecration schmidberger said 
in some places like in st louis which i visited during a 
recent tour of the united states the increase is even higher the 
local priest told me 
schmidberger said lefebvre had expected that attendance would 
decline by 25 percent while the vatican had figured that 80 percent 
would renounce links with the archbishop should he defy the pope 
there is no firm figure on the number of lefebvres active 
supporters as they do not register the vatican estimates the 
number at between 60000 to 80000 but two years ago a 
prolefebvre petition addressed to the vatican was backed by 135000 
signatures estimates have put sympathizers in the millions 
the consecration of the four bishops created the first major 
schism in the church in more than a century it resulted in the 
automatic excommunication or expulsion from the church of lefebvre 
and the four bishops and of monsignor antonio de castro mayer a 
brazilian prelate who assisted lefebvre in the ceremony at the swiss 
seminary in econe birthplace of the fraternity 
pope john paul ii in an apostolic letter made public two days 
later warned lefebvres followers that they too will be 
excommunicated if they stay with him at the same time he promised 
the church will permit their traditionalist practices if they remain 
loyal to rome 
a special eightmember commission was set up by the pope to bring 
lefebvres priests back into the church a new st peters 
fraternity features tradionalist liturgy under the vaticans 
auspices 
but the inauguration of the fraternitys first seminary in west 
germany has run into problems because of reported disagreements 
between the superior the rev joseph bissig and the local 
hierarchy bissig former head of a lefebvre seminary broke with 
the archbishop the day after the consecration 
that fraternity will never get off the ground said 
schmidberger these people sit between all chairs 
he voiced confidence that the traditionalist movement will 
continue to grow by the end of the year he said all four new 
bishops will have ordained 15 new priests in switzerland west 
germany argentina and australia where a seminary opened only 
recently in 1989 about 40 new ordinations are scheduled and the 
level of enrollment at the seminaries is unchanged he said 
the fraternitys activities are exclusively funded by private 
donations according to schmidberger we do not benefit from the 
church tax in fact our followers for example in germany and in 
some swiss cantons pay twice the church tax is collected by 
authorities in some countries on behalf of the church from 
registered members of religious community 
schmidberger a german national is also confident that 
eventually the vatican will seek a new dialogue with his fraternity 
he estimates that at least 10 of the 156 members of the college of 
cardinals secretly sympathize with the traditionalists 
but we will not take the initiative he said we are not 
under time pressure and we are in a relatively strong position

threads of an invisible jonestown have been 
so successfully woven into societys fabric that most people remain 
unaware of the proliferation and destructive power of cults in 
america 
people think the cult problem died in jonestown said 
patricia ryan daughter of us rep leo ryan who was killed by 
peoples temple gunmen hours before 912 people swallowed poison at 
the cults jungle compound but problems like this are happening 
everyday on a smaller scale cults are a huge problem 
a decade since the shock and horror of the jonestown massacre 
myths persist about cults and the people who become trapped in them 
the two most pervasive misconceptions that cult members are 
glassyeyed flower peddlers easily recognizable from everybody 
else and that people who become involved in cults were emotionally 
weak or defective to begin with 
people dont realize that destructive cults blend in very well 
with society they dont realize they may be working with someone in 
a cult that they may have relatives in a cult said cynthia 
kisser executive of the chicagobased national cult awareness 
network a clearinghouse for information about that most of the rev jim 
jones 
followers were good people who wanted to do good said journalist 
tim reiterman who spent more than four years investigating the 
peoples temple before and after the mass death and who was wounded 
in the port kaituma airstrip ambush that killed ryan and four others 
the peoples temple had its share of former drug addicts and 
excons it also attracted college professors whitecollar 
professionals and ivy league lawyers between these extremes were 
decent hardworking middleclass folk who believed in interracial 
harmony and helping others 
people still have the tendency to dismiss the people of the 
peoples temple as a bunch of crazies and kooks and worse but when 
youve spent a whole lot of time with the subject you understand 
theyre a whole lot like the rest of us said reiterman who wrote 
eloquently about jones and the temple in his 1982 book with 
coauthor john jacobs raven the untold story of the rev jim 
jones and his people 
afterward his descriptions of temple members were met with 
amazement people would say from the way youre describing these 
people they sound just like regular people well most of them 
were and but for circumstances or a weak moment in their lives or a 
desire to help other people they would never have ended up with jim 
jones 
for some the beginning was indiana in the 1950s when peoples 
temple was an interracial ministry with heavy evangelical and 
pentecostal overtones eventually the temple became less a 
religious group than a political one and always it was the 
handsome charismatic jones who inspired his diverse flock 
there was no way to separate his warped world from his 
idealized vision and his social conscience nor the real threats 
from his paranoia his benevolence from his cruelty his genius from 
his madness reiterman and jacobs wrote 
a master manipulator jones used classic mindcontrol techniques 
on his followers including isolation fear and denial of sleep 
protein and privacy by nov 18 1978 the leaders paranoid belief 
that death was the only way to avoid destruction by outside forces 
had been adopted by many people far more rational than jones 
they were drawn to jim jones as a father as a priest as a 
hero as someone who could complete their lives said california 
assemblywoman jackie speier who also was wounded at port kaituma 
in one way or another were all seeking that 
the fact that search continues is reflected in the volume of 
calls providing or requesting information of the cult awareness 
network 10000 this year twice as many as 1987 the kinds of 
groups eliciting the most inquiries include satanic biblebased 
new age and selfawareness kisser said 
the network believes destructive cults meet four criteria the 
use of deceptive recruiting financial exploitation of recruits for 
the group or leaders benefit use of mind control or brainwashing 
techniques and a feeling by members of being trapped 
the peoples temple fulfilled those as do others now public 
ignorance and denial of that fact make another jonestown a real 
possibility kisser said 
we do have these deaths occurring regularly but its one here 
and two there she said citing last months beating death of 
8yearold dayna lorae broussard whose father eldridge broussard 
founded the ecclesia athletic association 
through ecclesia more than 50 children were moved from 
innercity los angeles to a house near portland ore where 
authorities said the youngsters were beaten and starved 
for every child who died in jonestown many more have died 
since in similar circumstances kisser said tragedies are being 
perpetrated one person at a time

uncertainty about the results of todays presidential election is 
keeping the lid on activity in the stock and foreign exchange 
markets 
stock prices tumbled and the dollar fell in restrained 
electioneve dealings on monday 
the dow jones industrial average lost 2116 points to close the 
day at 212464 in the broader market four issues fell for every 
one that gained in nationwide trading of new york stock 
exchangelisted stocks 
analysts said investors withdrew from the market early on monday 
neither buying nor selling to await the outcome of todays vote 
they said while wall street felt relatively certain of a victory by 
republican george bush investors were cautious after weekend polls 
suggested democrat michael dukakis had narrowed the gap in some 
areas 
those concerns also were cited for a decline in the dollar 
against all major currencies except the canadian dollar 
the dollar finished lower in european trading and continued to 
drift steadily downward as activity shifted to the united states 
despite the depth of the currencys drop trading was quiet 
in the bond market prices slipped and interest rates rose 
rates also finished at the highest levels in more than three 
years at the regular weekly treasury bill auction 
the treasury department sold 72 billion in threemonth bills at 
an average discount rate of 754 percent up from 737 percent last 
week another 72 billion was sold in sixmonth bills at an average 
discount rate of 771 percent up from 748 percent last week 
the rates were the highest since may 13 1985 when threemonth 
bills sold for 769 percent and sixmonth bills averaged 79 percent 
separately the federal reserve said in a new economic report 
that americans took out 188 billion more in consumer debt than 
they paid off in september the smallest advance in 10 months 
the september increase in consumer debt was down from an august 
rise of 532 billion and was the smallest monthly advance since a 
179 billion rise in november 1987 
while much of the decline in september was traced to weak auto 
sales economists said the pattern of the past several months 
indicated consumers had grown more cautious in their buying plans 
from july through september consumer debt rose at an annual rate 
of 675 percent down significantly from a 102 percent growth rate 
in the first six months of the year

i would like to see students more sensitized to this said 
peter yee a member of the experimental computing facility at the 
university of californias berkeley campus one of the targets of 
the mass infestation 
the virus believed spread by a computer science student at 
cornell university clogged computers at universities and research 
institutes by spreading via electronic mail networks and making 
repeated copies of itself 
before this incident students felt that security and privacy 
were somebody elses problems yee said monday now that one of 
our own has done this i expect more indepth discussion 
others queried in an informal sampling of top us universities 
said they believe most computerscience students have a fundamental 
grasp of proper ethical conduct but several said computer advances 
are moving so quickly that questions of right and wrong often have 
not been discussed in depth 
harvard takes very seriously the issues of moral and ethical 
behavior not only in the area of computer science education but in 
all aspects said john shattuck vice president for government 
community and public affairs at the prestigious institution 
i think theres a broad consensus among students and faculty at 
harvard that tampering with major computer information systems is a 
very bad thing to do and it can cause disruption within the whole 
social structure he said 
at the same time shattuck said i think the technology is 
moving so rapidly here that its somehow gotten ahead of the 
discussion and careful weighing of principles as reflected in the 
slow evolution in the law in this area this case will certainly 
draw attention to the questions 
eugene mallove spokesman and chief science writer for the 
massachusetts institute of technology said the virus incident 
compelled the schools authorities to reiterate their policy on the 
misuse of computers which will be published wednesday in the campus 
newspaper tech talk 
were going to send out a message loud and clear that this is 
not to be tolerated this is not a matter to be taken lightly he 
said 
the virus incident occurred just a few weeks after mit held a 
symposium on ethics in hightechnology fields titled how to be 
good although the specific question of spreading computer viruses 
wasnt discussed mallove said 
james ball director of computing facilities at stanford 
university another key virus victim said most students and 
researchers were awed by the infestation and how easily it spread 
a lot of us have talked about what could have happened if this 
had been a malicious attack it could have been a real disaster 
ball said for us the reaction was wiping the sweat off our brow 
and saying woooh 
but ball said that underlying ethical and legal questions about 
why spreading such a virus was wrong or even whether it was wrong 
havent been discussed much reflecting an important weakness in the 
discipline 
theres a great deal of naivete among computer science people 
they spend an enormous amount of their lives in front of a screen 
some are somewhat introverted he said computer scientists i 
dont believe have the foggiest notions about laws on things such 
as copyright infringements 
still ball said i think theres a general impression it was 
wrong people were talking about the possibilities of fines and 
imprisonment people realize the severity of the potential outcome 
for people who do it sort of like if im speeding and i see a crash 
where people burned to death

miller brewing co which revolutionized the 
industry with the success of its lowcalorie beer is reshaping the 
market again with its hotselling bottled draft beer 
and industry observers say packaged draft sales should continue 
climbing as companies search for ways to snatch portions of a 
stagnant beer market 
they miller know how to experiment and i think it becomes 
more important as the market goes sideways said robert weinberg 
a former anheuserbusch inc executive who now heads a st 
louisbased brewing industry research firm 
miller owned by philip morris companies inc introduced genuine 
draft in 1986 and sold about 14 million barrels that year sales 
nearly doubled last year and company officials say there could be 
50 percent growth in 1988 
sales still are small when compared with the topselling beers in 
the country such as budweiser from anheuserbusch inc and millers 
lite beer 
but the success of genuine draft has led adolph coors co to 
revamp its strategy and market its premium and superpremium beers 
as draft products 
we think packaged draft could be the emerging growth category 
of the 1980s into the 1990s said ralph kytan general draft brand 
manager by next spring the company expects to have spent more than 
80 million in equipping its breweries for genuine draft production 
draft beer which is not pasteurized and the concept of selling 
it in bottles and cans is not new analysts say companies attempted 
to sell packaged draft beer in the 1960s and 1970s but they did not 
give it the same push as now largely because the market was growing 
and there was less pressure to sell new products 
miller which has been struggling with the decline of its 
flagship high life brand got the idea to introduce genuine draft 
after witnessing a surge in packaged draft sales in japan kytan 
said 
when youre in a flat industry obviously you have to be 
turning over every stone he said 
coors based in golden colo long has promoted its 
nonpasteurized beer which company officials say has helped sales 
but the coors premium line had eroded over the past decade and the 
company recently introduced a second premium brand coors extra 
gold advertised as a boldertasting beer 
now both products are being marketed as draft beers in the wake 
of millers success 
michael marranzino a brand director at coors described the 
change more as an evolution rather than a dramatic departure 
since draft is really a process which weve been using for many 
years 
marranzino acknowledged that when miller introduced its 
nonpasteurized beer officials at coors hoped their milwaukeebased 
competitor would succeed in hooking the consumer on draft beer 
we had a natural tiein he said 
john collopy president of the milwaukee investment firm cleary 
gull reiland mcdevitt amp collopy inc said coors has been drafting 
on millers marketing but he also said coors must get its 
products to grow on their own if they are to succeed 
with competition for market share continuing to tighten analysts 
say anheuserbusch the nations no 1 brewer obviously is watching 
the developments at miller and coors 
an anheuserbusch spokesman mike fleming said the companys 
policy is not to comment on the competition or whether any new 
strategies are planned 
but jerry steinman publisher of beer marketers insights an 
industry newsletter said he has strong information indicating 
anheuser has investigated the packaged draft market to some degree 
it makes sense he said if you have competition doing well 
with something you check it out 
in gaining rapid success with its product miller has tapped into 
public perceptions that draft beer tastes better analysts say 
i think most beer drinkers think draft beer is better said 
weinberg there is a magic there 
kytan claims millers process of filtering the beer instead of 
sterilizing it with heat gives the brew a darn close taste to 
draft beer from a keg 
but weinberg says miller might be capitalizing more on the image 
than the product and contends the average consumer could have a 
difficult time telling the difference between packaged draft and 
another premium beer

analysts say they doubt whether pillsbury 
cos plan to spin off its troubled burger king subsidiary will 
thwart grand metropolitan plcs 523 billion hostile takeover bid 
but a judges ruling may have given the company more time to fight 
pillsbury announced monday morning that it would spin off 
miamibased burger king as a separate public company owned by 
pillsbury shareholders under a plan approved by the board of 
directors 
in trading monday on the new york stock exchange pillsbury fell 
137 to 59 a share 
after the market closed a delaware judge denied grand mets 
request met to block pillsbury from using its poison pill 
takeover defense against the tender offer grand mets takeover bid 
was conditioned on the defense being lifted 
but retired justice william duffy sided with pillsbury in 
delaware chancery court he ruled that the companys directors 12 
of whom are independent of the company were abiding by their 
fiduciary responsibilities in keeping the plan in place 
ian martin chief of grand mets us operations said his 
company has asked duffy to reconsider his ruling because it did not 
take into consideration pillsburys plan to spin off burger king 
steve carnes a former pillsbury executive who is an analyst for 
piper jaffray amp hopwood inc in minneapolis said mondays events 
favored pillsbury but the food and restaurant companys battle 
against grand met was far from over 
carnes and other analysts criticized the burger king plan they 
said it would weaken the already troubled restaurant chain and 
amount to a combined 40 value for shareholders compared with the 
60 in cash grand met has offered for each share of pillsbury common 
stock 
under the plan pillsbury said it would distribute one share of 
burger king common stock for each share of pillsbury common stock 
payable on jan 27 or earlier for shareholders of record on dec 2 
the company also said burger king would declare special dividends 
of cash and securities payable after the spinoff the size of the 
special dividends was not disclosed 
pillsbury has the right to cancel the dividends but the company 
said the payout would provide immediate value to shareholders 
while at the same time allowing burger king to grow and develop 
values in the future 
pillsburys board also directed management to continue exploring 
other alternatives for boosting shareholder values 
martin said pillsburys plan is vague and does not contain 
sufficient information to evaluate the separate pillsbury and burger 
king companies 
he also said debt resulting from the plan would weaken both 
companies possibly leading to largescale layoffs plant closings 
and a reduction in philanthropy 
carnes and analyst malcom knapp who heads his own firm in new 
york said the debt the plan would add to an already troubled burger 
king would make a turnaround of the worlds secondlargest 
restaurant chain less likely 
its a desperate thing knapp said it doesnt make any 
sense 
burger king accounts for about onethird of pillsburys sales and 
about twothirds of its profits but has not done well recently in 
the fiscal year ended may 31 the chains pretax profits plunged 
more than 50 percent from a year earlier to 482 million 
the companys stagnant sales have been blamed partly on 
inconsistent advertising burger king dumped its advertising agency 
j walter thompson last fall after an association of 11 years 
burger king chairman jerry w levin acknowledged the marketing 
problems but praised the new business arrangement at a news 
conference in miami where the chain is based 
we think it makes us best equipped to create a full turnaround 
for burger king he said 
separately pillsbury chairman philip smith said the companys 
remaining operations will be streamlined with its wellknown brands 
becoming its principal business products included in pillsburys 
packaged foods unit are green giant vegetables and haagendazs ice 
cream among others

pillsbury cos proposal to spin off its burger king 
fastfood business to shareholders would relieve it of a prized 
business that has caused pillsbury problems with its weakening 
earnings 
pillsbury announced the planned spinoff on monday as part of its 
strategy to try to thwart a 523 billion hostile buyout bid by 
british conglomerate grand metropolitan plc 
jerry w levin burger king chairman told a news conference 
monday that the plan marked a positive change for the chain which 
he said apparently had suffered from marketing problems and 
inability to achieve consistency in all its 5578 outlets 
it is clear were going to have to change there should be some 
corporate streamlining he said 
burger king will be adding departments to replace corporate 
services formerly provided by pillsbury even as it eliminates other 
positions to tighten its operation levin said 
analysts say burger king which accounts for about onethird of 
pillsburys sales and twothirds of its profits is a prime example 
of the parent companys recent problems with some of its food 
operations 
since pillsbury took over the miamibased chain in 1967 it has 
had five chairmen and eight presidents most recently charles s 
olcott resigned the presidency last month after two years 
william maguire an analyst with merrill lynch amp co in new york 
said olcott wasnt a marketing man when they needed a marketing 
man badly 
burger kings pretax profits were down more than 50 percent in 
the year ended may 31 to 482 million from 1192 million in the 
previous year 
its systemwide sales rose 7 percent to 540 billion in the year 
ended may 31 but net sales which includes sales only at 
companyowned restaurants as well as royalties and fees from 
franchised restaurants dropped 54 percent to 184 billion from 
195 billion the previous year 
average sales per store also fell 1 percent to just over 1 
million 
the company concedes that part of the problem has been 
inconsistent marketing 
burger king dumped its advertising agency j walter thompson 
last fall after an association of 11 years 
thompson had created advertising in the early 1980s that 
compared burger kings flamebroiled approach to cooking with that 
used by mcdonalds the campaign was credited for helping lift 
burger king sales 
but campaigns in more recent years failed to provide the same 
spark burger kings search for the nerdy herb bombed and its 
subsequent this is a burger king town and best food for fast 
times failed to produce sales gains 
in late september 1987 burger king selected nw ayer amp co as 
its new agency in early 1988 it rolled out its new ad theme we 
do it like youd do it the company said that the campaign has 
helped boost awareness of burger kings name even if sales have not 
shot higher 
other problems also have arisen last month twelve of the 
chains black franchisees sued the company on the grounds it 
assigned black operators unprofitable locations reserving more 
lucrative outlets for white franchise holders

rjr nabisco inc is adding another element to the 
epic takeover battle for the food and tobacco conglomerate with its 
board of directors considering the possible sale of its food 
businesses in advance of any takeover 
the possible sale of the food businesses which last year 
accounted for about 60 percent of the companys 158 billion in net 
sales was announced monday by the special committee appointed by 
the board to evaluate the unprecedented multibilliondollar buyout 
offers already made for rjr nabisco 
the committee also said it had set a nov 18 deadline for 
submission of any proposals to acquire either the entire company or 
just its tobacco businesses and warned bidders that it would not 
consider their offers if they did not agree to the terms it set for 
the auction 
rjr nabisco already is the target of a record 203 billion 
tender offer worth 90 a share by the new york investment firm 
kohlberg kravis roberts inc and a rival proposal by nabisco 
management to acquire the company for 207 billion or 92 a share 
the new york buyout firm forstmann little amp co announced last 
week it led an investor group including consumer products giant 
procter amp gamble co the investment firm goldman sachs amp co and 
ralston purina co interested in a possible counteroffer that 
would surpass both existing bids 
rjr stock rose 175 a share to 8737 in new york stock 
exchange composite trading on monday 
the special committee said that if the board decided to sell 
rjrs food businesses the aftertax proceeds would be paid to 
shareholders before any acquisition of rjr 
accordingly parties are invited to submit proposals on a basis 
which in effect would involve acquiring rjr nabisco as a 
standalone tobacco company the committee stated 
furthermore the committee has ordered its financial advisers to 
explore available alternatives other than a buyout of the company 
industry analysts have estimated rjr nabiscos food businesses 
would bring a sale price ranging from 125 billion to 155 billion 
atlantabased rjr nabisco makes such wellknown brands as winston 
and camel cigarettes oreo cookies and del monte vegetables 
the committee said it had made no final decision on whether to 
sell the company or any of its parts and that the board had decided 
to take no position on the pending tender offer by kohlberg kravis 
in addition the committee stated it was inviting the inclusion 
in bids of a substantial common stockrelated equity component 
the panels announcement did not elaborate on the reasons for the 
request although including stock in their offers would enable 
bidders to increase the value of their bids without having to come 
up with more cash 
the panel also warned that it would consider any attempt to bid 
for the company outside of its guidelines would be considered a 
hostile overture and neither the special committee nor the board 
would consider offers from any bidders that had not agreed to those 
terms 
a buyout of the rjr nabisco food businesses would mirror the 
recent trend that has seen the acquisitions and sometimes breaking 
up of the nations biggest food companies 
last month kraft inc agreed to be acquired by food and tobacco 
giant philip morris companies inc in a 131 billion buyout the 
secondbiggest us corporate acquisition ever there also is a 
battle being waged by pillsbury co against a 52 billion hostile 
buyout offer by britains grand metropolitan plc a food liquor and 
real estate conglomerate 
the big food companies are considered attractive because of their 
established brand names and relative steady businesses which are 
regarded as recession proof

is expected the dollar would fall by a few pfennigs against the 
west german mark 
i can imagine that the dollar will drop to 175 marks and then 
well have to see at what point the central banks step in said a 
dealer at a large frankfurt bank 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins 
the dollar fell 034 yen to a closing 12473 yen later in london 
it was quoted at a higher rate of 12525 yen

17780 to buy one pound more expensive than 17755 late monday

the central bank did not want to make any move before the election

session 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials was up 1032 points at

until after the poll results 
late monday some observers said that wall street already had 
built a george bush victory into the market and had begun to turn 
its attention to postelection concerns like the federal budget 
deficit

preelection jitters following weekend polls that suggested michael 
dukakis might be closing in on george bushs lead 
this morning analysts said investors seemed to put aside their 
nervousness about the elections outcome 
in some sense its a nowin situation in the election said

market yawns 
analysts said todays market appeared to be bouncing back from 
declines the two previous days sparked by recent economic reports 
an unexpectedly low jobless rate for october combined with other

a stronger economy could signal higher inflation and in turn 
higher interest rates if the federal reserve moves to slow the 
economy

court action to oust him the trustee appointed to run sharon steel 
corp during the companys reorganization in bankruptcy court 
announced his resignation tuesday 
the job has been far more demanding than i expected and i 
dont want to continue in a role that takes such a heavy toll on my 
life trustee james w toren said 
his resignation filed monday in erie with us bankruptcy judge 
warren bentz takes effect when a successor is appointed and 
confirmed by the court 
creditors told toren 73 at an oct 7 meeting that they would 
petition the court for his removal if he did not resign 
toren who was appointed in january infuriated creditors in june 
when he suspended negotiations in which the company was seeking 
contract concessions from 2100 members of the united steelworkers 
union he reasoned that the workers should not be asked for 
concessions until the companys financial condition was clear 
creditors argued that enough was known to seek wage and benefit 
givebacks 
among other actions toren sued sharon chairman victor posner for 
the return of 14 norman rockwell paintings that hung in posners 
miami beach office and for a refund from the 162 million posner 
paid himself between 1983 and late 1987 
chief operating officer walter sieckman says sharon whose lone 
steel plant is in this western pennsylvania community is marginally 
profitable creditors claim the company is still losing money 
employment at the victor posner works has increased by several 
hundred in recent months to about 2500

close the agriculture department announced the soviets had 
purchased 300000 metric tons of meal 
the sale announcement doesnt seem to have much influence in 
todays market gustafson said

the top us foreign trade representative has 
sharply criticized the west german government for its decision to 
take over an increased share of europes airbus industrie consortium 
i find this a very disturbing development clayton yeutter 
said monday such a unilalteral action by the west german 
government at this time and in this manner will greatly increase 
tensions in the trade arena he added 
yeutters statement followed the bonn governments decision to 
take over an increased share of messerscmittboelkowblohm mbb 
the weapons producer which is the parent company of duetsche airbus 
the german airbus consortium partner 
the decision is designed to offset potential losses on airbus 
manufacturing programs which west german officials blame on the high 
exchange rate of the west german mark to the us dollar 
a decision to provide additional airbus subsidies is 
particularly unacceptable coming as it does during ongoing 
discussions between the airbus partner governments and the united 
states the statement said 
the lengthy negotiations within the framework of gatt the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade is designed to determine 
government subsidy levels for civilian aircraft manufacturers 
the united states believes the french german and british 
governments support for airbus is unfair competition to boeing and 
mcdonnell douglas two american companies that are airbus biggest 
competitors 
it is an essential tenet of private enterprise that business 
firms absorb the risks associated with commercial ventures 
including exchange rate risks yeutter said why should airbus 
be singled out for special treatment 
exchange rate fluctuations are part of the risks of international 
business yeutter said and they should not be borne by german 
taxpayers or workers in other industries either in germany or the 
united states 
when the us dollar was strong the united states did not 
subsidize american manufacturers despite their loss of 
competitiveness yeutter said similarly we expect other 
countries to avoid such temptations his statement said 
yeutter said he would be meeting soon with west german officials 
to review their decision and examine the consistency of such 
support with the federal republic of germanys international 
obligations

the european economic community said 
tuesday a ban on imports of hormonetreated meat will take effect as 
planned jan 1 despite threats of retaliation from the united 
states 
one must count on a total ban of hormones from the beginning of 
next year a spokesman for the eec executive commission said 
clayton yeutter the us trade representative and richard lyng 
the us agriculture secretary are to arrive in brussels nov 18 to 
discuss the hormone ban and other trade issues with senior eec 
commission officials 
the eec ban on meat treated with growth hormones stems from fears 
such meat causes cancer 
but the united states claims there is no scientific justification 
for a blanket ban on hormones in meat and argues the eec ban amounts 
to an unfair trade practice 
the ban was to have taken effect jan 1 1988 but was delayed by 
a year in the hope a compromise solution could be negotiated 
but as negotiations reached a deadlock in recent months five 
us industry groups have asked the administration to restrict or 
cutoff imports of eec meat or meat products if the eec imposes its 
hormone ban 
president reagan has already announced but not enacted 100 
percent tariffs on eec meat and meat products if the ban is imposed 
the united states exports about 100 million worth of meat and 
meat products to the eec each year by comparison eec exports to 
the united states total some 450 million 
the eec commission spokesman reiterated the eec view that growth 
hormones must be banned from meat for health reasons and that no 
proof has been offered to show that the use of hormones is safe 
there are no new elements as far as were concerned he said 
he added italy denmark west germany and belgium had already 
banned domestic sales of hormonetreated meat before the eec 
decision was implemented eecwide on jan 1 of this year

financier carl icahn the chairman and owner of 
trans world airlines inc still is considering making a bid for 
ailing eastern airlines after abandoning an earlier effort 
according to a published report 
the washington post in todays editions quoted twa general 
counsel mark buckstein as saying a bid by icahn for eastern is a 
possibility 
last month icahn broke off efforts to acquire eastern after 
failing to structure a deal that would satisfy the airlines 
militant unions 
texas air corp the parent of eastern recently agreed to sell 
easterns profitable shuttle service to developer donald trump for 
365 million in cash 
buckstein told the post that an icahn bid for the rest of eastern 
would depend on the financiers ability to conclude favorable labor 
contracts at twa and on working out an agreement with easterns 
unions 
icahn said in a statement issued monday that the best way for twa 
to achieve needed growth is through acquisitions although he did 
not specifically mention eastern 
there was no question twa must grow to thrive and by far 
the most preferable way for the airline to grow is through 
acquisitions he said 
twa announced monday that its president d joseph corr has 
resigned and it is restructuring its top management the airline 
which was privatized on oct 24 created a new office of the 
chairman comprised of icahn and two other top officials 
icahns statement fueled speculation on wall street that he is 
seeking to sell part or all of twa the wall street journal said 
today 
icahn who holds 90 percent of the shares of twa told the 
journal that the airline isnt for sale ive been saying that for 
three years i cant make it any plainer he said 
the journal and the post also noted rumors in financial circles 
that more than half a dozen other potential bidders for eastern may 
be on the horizon 
corr the departing twa president was mentioned as an interested 
party as well as morton ehrlich who recently resigned as twas 
executive vice president 
the post quoted union sources as saying a group of st louis 
investors also are trying to make a bid for eastern 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo told the journal that eastern is 
not for sale when he agreed to sell the shuttle to trump however 
lorenzo indicated that the rest of eastern might be sold if the 
price were right 
there are all kinds of coconuts out there that can be dressed 
up as a buyer for eastern lorenzo said

harris corp on tuesday said it has signed 
a definitive agreement covering its previouslydisclosed plan to buy 
general electric cos solid state semiconductor business for 206 
million 
purchase of the unit initially announced aug 15 will boost 
harris semiconductor sales by 550 million to 850 million said 
john t hartley harris chairman and chief executive officer 
harris which had overall sales of 21 billion last year 
supplies information communication and semiconductor systems 
products ansd services to government and commercial markets 
worldwide 
the deal has come under fire from some wall street analysts who 
question the companys commitment to the volatile semiconductor 
market and say that the purchase will dilute earnings 
you either want to be in the semiconductor business or you 
dont and we do hartley responded this is a chance to take a 
major step forward a giant leap to become one of the major american 
players in the semiconductor business 
the new division which takes the name harris semiconductor will 
make harris the nations sixth largest producer of semiconductors 
the company said 
hartley said the ge business was particularly attractive because 
of its close fit with harris adding an international dimension to 
company sales especially in europe and the pacific rim and 
expertise in specialized market sectors such as highpower 
conductors used in the automotive industry 
he acknowledged that the semiconductor market was cyclical in the 
short run but said it has shown excellent longrun growth and that 
harris has learned to manage around the sectors volatility 
another doubt surrounding the deal is the forecast for flat or 
declining budgets in the defense department one of the industrys 
largest clients 
but hartley said while defense expenditures overall are expected 
to be stagnant the electronic components sector is projected to 
show modest growth 
and its a very large budget he added 
the company which has committed itself to raising 
earningspershare said the purchase will not dilute shareholders 
return 
we do not expect this to be dilutive hartley said we 
expect this to be a contributor to earnings in both the long run and 
the short run 
hartley said he expects to sign a financing agreement for the 
deal in 30 days he said harris expects to have some increase in 
debt which could come from some combination of public financing 
bank borrowing or internal cash generation 
hartley also said that while harris does not currently compete 
directly with the japanese who dominate the highvolume 
lowerprice end of the semiconductor market the purchase positions 
harris to fend off any future such competition 
i think you have to be a certain size to fight with the 
japanese and this will help hartley said

victor the polls closed in the tiny hamlet of dixville notch nh 
while most people on the east coast were still on their way to work 
the market is waiting for the election results said eldon a

sessions amid concerns that the economy is growing faster than 
expected

found jobs in october than in the previous month suggesting the 
economy might be overheating that report revived inflation worries 
and concern that the federal reserve might move to slow the economy

17 percent as its sales began to recover from a yearlong slump 
meanwhile walmart stores inc which has thrived while other 
retailers stagnated said its earnings rose 33 percent during the 
quarter 
limited based in columbus ohio said it earned 704 million 
or 39 cents a share during the quarter ended oct 29 up from 693 
million or 36 cents a share in the same period of fiscal 1987 
sales at the specialty apparel retailer totaled 101 billion up 
135 percent from 8917 million in the third quarter a year earlier 
limited showed signs of recovery during september and october 
following a year of dismal sales many apparel retailers have seen 
their sales slump and profits decline since the third quarter of 
1987 as women shied away from the stores fall and spring fashions 
some observers believe limited whose divisions include limited 
limited express lerner victorias secret and lane bryant stores 
will lead the industry recovery 
limited chairman leslie wexner said things began to feel 
normal during the latest quarter 
the company and other retailers will be hoping for continued 
improvement during the fourth quarter when storeowners earn more 
than half their annual profits 
limited reported its earnings for the first three quarters fell 
273 percent to 125 million or 69 cents a share from 1719 
million or 90 cents a share in the first nine months of 1987 
the yeartodate figures reflect the slump in the apparel 
industry 
sales for the period rose 75 percent to 271 billion from 252 
billion for the first three quarters last year 
there were no surprises in walmarts earnings report as the 
discount store chain performed as well as industry analysts expected

earlier 
the company based in bentonville ark reported sales of 499 
billion up 241 percent from 402 billion in the third quarter of 
1987 
although most general retailers have had sluggish sales for more 
than a year and a half walmarts lowprice strategy has helped the 
company escape the problems its competitors have encountered the 
company which has some of the lowest expenses in the business has 
not had to undergo the costcutting steps that other retailers have 
been forced to implement 
walmart reported yeartodate earnings of 514 million or 91 
cents per share up 35 percent from 3805 million or 67 cents per 
share in the same period of 1987 
the discounter said its sales increased 282 percent to 1412 
billion from 1096 billion in the first nine months of 1987

drexel burnham lambert inc and former white 
house chief of staff howard baker said tuesday they have conferred 
professionally about drexels internal operations but denied a 
report that the discussions were related to a criminal investigation 
of the wall street investment giant 
the washington post quoting sources it did not identify said 
drexel was negotiating with baker about becoming its chairman a 
move that some of the firms officials reportedly see as a say of 
escaping criminal charges 
drexel one of the biggest us investment companies has been 
under intense scrutiny for nearly two years by manhattan us 
attorney rudolph w giuliani as a result of its relationship with 
ivan f boesky the nowimprisoned insider trader who has turned 
states evidence 
the securities and exchange commission accused drexel two months 
ago of numerous securities fraud violations a grand jury impaneled 
by giuliani has sent socalled target letters to the firm and other 
prospective defendants a strong signal that criminal charges may be 
filed 
drexel has denied wrongdoing 
the washington post story implied drexel might be tapping baker 
as part of a broader strategy to convince giuliani that criminal 
charges are unwarranted baker knows giuliani and offered him the 
sec chairmanship last year but the prosecutor declined 
baker a highly respected statesman and former tennessee senator 
who quit the white house job july 1 for personal reasons 
acknowledged through spokesman thomas griscom that he and his 
knoxville law firm had been working with drexel on internal 
governance matters of corporate operations there is no involvement 
with the impending legal action 
drexel spokesman steven anreder also issued a statement saying 
the firm has been working with baker and his law firm baker 
worthington crossley stansberry amp woolf on matters relating to 
internal corporate governance 
the statement said those discussions are unrelated to either 
the ongoing investigation by the us attorney or any washington 
matters 
both spokesmen said it would be inappropriate to comment further 
giuliani said through spokesman edward schwartz that he would 
have no comment 
securities lawyers familiar with the drexel case and giulianis 
record expressed strong doubts that the firm would even contemplate 
recruiting baker to avoid an indictment or negotiate a plea bargain 
for one thing they said such a move would smack of impropriety 
moreover they said it was inconsistent with bakers irreproachable 
reputation and giulianis tough record on white collar defendants 
if drexel thinks it can influence the outcome of an 
investigation that has gone on for nearly two years by doing that 
theyre nuts theyve got to be out of their minds to think that 
said ira l sorkin a former sec regional commissioner and federal 
prosecutor who is now in private practice 
the target letters have already gone out he said now 
comes howard baker and waves his magic wand it makes no sense to 
me its crazy insane 
some lawyers speculated drexel had retained bakers firm as part 
of a broader policy of seeking highly respected public figures to 
help make corporate policy changes and enhance its public image to 
combat the negative publicity of a possible indictment 
other major firms have recruited wellknown washington 
personalities former white house budget director david stockman 
for example was hired by salomon brothers inc former 
transportation secretary drew lewis was tapped to head union pacific 
corp former federal reserve chairman paul volcker joined the 
investment banking firm of james d wolfensohn amp co 
i dont believe any one at drexel would be talking to howard 
baker for any influence in the criminal investigation said gerald 
walpin a securitieslaw attorney and former federal prosecutor in 
new york 
if they are talking to him they may be looking for something 
to add to the response to the attacks made on them in the media 
theyre trying to put the best face forward walpin said thats 
not unusual to seek out somebody who has a fine reputation in the 
public in order to create the best possible image

mostly higher livestock and meat were mixed and stockindex 
futures advanced 
the platinum market led the preciousmetals complex lower partly 
on speculation that a likely republican presidential victory would

cents lower with december at 6425 a troy ounce

weakening oil market also contributed to the selloff of precious 
metals said peter cardillo commodities trading adviser with 
josephthal amp co in new york 
despite tuesdays decline platinum supplies are tight and are 
expected to remain so for the next several years 
so no matter who wins i would not be surprised to see the 
rally pick up again levine said 
copper for december delivery jumped 34 cents to 1423 a pound 
on the comex on reports of an escalation in the peruvian miners 
strike

workers might join the strike which has brought copper mining and 
smelting operations to a halt the strike in peru the worlds 
seventhlargest copper producer entered its fourth week on tuesday

refocus on interest rates and other worries that have chilled the 
market recently 
the dow jones industrial average advanced 285 points to close at

the way in order to focus on the issues said hugh johnson senior 
vice president for first albany corp people are taking a deep 
breath and just starting to think about that 
analysts attributed the early burst of enthusiasm partly to 
anticipation of a bush win after the nations first poll showed the 
vice president an easy victor 
there was a little rebound in the market with returns from new 
hampshire based on that the market popped up said emmanuel 
geronimous senior vice president with shearson lehman hutton inc 
the polls closed in the tiny hamlet of dixville notch nh 
before most of the nation was awake 
the stock market also got early support from higher bond prices 
and a stronger dollar in foreign exchange trading as well as 
technical factors the market had declined sharply in two previous 
sessions on what many analysts said was concern about the economy 
and uncertainty about the outcome of the presidential election 
despite the early gains stock prices faded early with few 
institutional investors to lend the market support many banks and 
insurance companies were closed for election day and volume was 
relatively light 
in addition analysts said investors returned to a cautious mode 
preferring to wait for the election results before making new 
commitments 
it was kind of a fearful session said eldon a grimm senior 
vice president for birr wilson amp co after this long bitter 
election the market was waiting to get it over 
analysts were mixed in their projections for wednesdays market
