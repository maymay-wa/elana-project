a comment by mayor hitoshi motoshima that 
emperor hirohito shared responsibility for world war ii has sparked 
angry rallies against the city leader and calls for his ouster 
at a city council meeting earlier this month motoshima was asked 
what he thought about the 87yearold emperors role in the war 
judging from historical accounts and his own wartime experience 
motoshima said i believe the emperor shares responsibility for 
the war as well as all of us who lived in that period 
coming on the 47th anniversary of the bombing of pearl harbor 
the comments were seen as especially inappropriate by japanese who 
consider it despicable to criticize a suffering person hirohito has 
been seriously ill with intestinal bleeding for three months 
on dec 21 and 22 about 100 sound trucks surrounded city hall 
and about 260 radical rightists wearing militarystyle uniforms were 
present 
a delegation from the liberal democratic party which controls 
the national government and had backed the indepependent motoshima 
since he took office in 1979 demanded the mayor retract the 
comments motoshima has refused 
how can i take it back when i said what i believe he asked 
i feel the withdrawal of my statement would endanger the hardwon 
freedom of speech in this country 
his view of the emperors partial responsibility for the war is 
believed widely held among japanese especially intellectuals 
hirohito was a figurehead while real power was held by 
militarists but he was able to decide to end the war when the 
government was evenly divided in august 1945 after the united 
states dropped atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki 
in nagasaki on that aug 9 more than 70000 people died about 
35 percent of the citys population in hiroshima which took the 
first bomb aug 6 the death toll was about 140000

dublins millennium celebration has been a 
great success city leaders say putting the fair back into the 
fair city with its biggest face lift ever 
the yearlong birthday party with more than 1000 events ranging 
from cultural extravaganzas to sporting matches also boosted 
tourism business and jobs organizers say 
critics complain the festival was badly organized and ignored 
most of dublin and the rest of ireland some say dublin actually is 
much older than 1000 years and that the date was blarney 
arbitrarily chosen to draw tourists 
when we came into the dublin event it was a time of national 
pessimism here said matt mcnulty managing director of the 
festival people said what is there to celebrate dublin looks 
terrible 
the capital of 1 million people had become grimy and derelict 
vandalism and littering was rampant unemployment near 20 percent 
bred widespread poverty 
persistent rain and occasional smog from coalburning fires 
almost obscure the large squares the grand georgian buildings and 
the brightly colored doors studded with brass knockers and topped 
with fanlights 
but better to light a candle than curse the dark says 
mcnulty so cityscape improvements became the focus of the 
millennium 
the site has been inhabited for 5000 years and the danes built 
a maritime settlement here in 841 the millennium celebrates the 
capture of dublin by celtic monarch mael sechnaill from the vikings 
in 988 
we tried to plan a number of things that were permanent we 
felt we would be judged more on the things that were left behind 
mcnulty said 
the governments big projects were to repave the center aisle of 
oconnell street dublins oncegraceful main boulevard that had 
degenerated into a neonandplastic strip and to turn grafton 
street a principal shopping street into a pedestrian mall 
oconnell street is no longer ticky tacky said lord mayor 
ben briscoe its a beautiful street once again 
about 70 shop fronts have been spruced up 180 buildings floodlit 
and countless others cleaned around the city during the year 
mcnulty said 
dublin has been given 10000 new trees and three new parks one 
of them commemorates dublins great writers including james joyce 
oscar wilde and wb yeats it was funded by irish distillers group 
plc because most of our writers were good customers of the 
publicans mcnulty said 
the mayors georgian mansion house built in 1705 was 
refurbished and the 197yearold custom house is being restored 
twelve statues have been unveiled funded by irish companies in 
the 19th century spirit of industrialists endowing the city with art 
the centerpiece is a combination statuefountain called anna 
livia the name the joyce gave to dublins river liffey its not to 
everyones taste and dublin wits were quick to nickname it the 
floozy in the jacuzzi 
if you look at a photograph of the taj mahal you know you are 
looking at india dublin doesnt have a lot of things that are 
widely internationally known she anna livia will certainly help 
that mcnulty said 
city manager frank feely who conceived the festival said to 
me the most important thing about the millennum was to put the city 
on show for itself thats all the good for the future because if 
people are proud of their city they take better care of it it will 
inspire confidence 
publican shane finnegan said its had a great impact 
but partick carroll an engineering student felt differently 
all of the millennium has been concentrated on the central portion 
of dublin the rest of it is totally neglected he said 
tourism rose more than 13 percent in 1988 from the previous 
years 2 million visitors mcnulty said he had hoped for a 10 
percent gain 
dublin tourism revenue was about 227 million in 1988 up from 
196 million last year he said 
direct projects created 130 potentially permanent jobs plus jobs 
at many irish businesses mcnulty said 
taxi driver joe higgins said the festival helped his business 
but complained about the planning he said he hadnt been given 
literature early on to help guide passengers to sites and events 
jimmy oneill a bank employee said country people are a bit 
fed up with it getting left out because dublin was the capital 
they should have made it more relevant to the whole country 
the 26yearold claims to have had the best idea of all and 
shared it over a pint of guinness the national drink at one of 
dublins many boisterous pubs 
free drink for a week thats what they should have done he 
said

four months after the roxbury neighborhood was 
galvanized by the killing of an 11yearold girl caught in crossfire 
from rival drug gangs the area has been shaken by three fatal 
shootings over christmas 
im so tired of going to funerals for my students said 
teacher cynthia swamigan to see these kids in coffins is 
devastating 
more than 400 people attended the funeral in august for tiffany 
moore who was shot twice in the head while sitting on a corner 
mailbox talking to friends 
the slaying sparked an outcry for more police protection in the 
lowerincome neighborhood where a large percentage of the citys 
blacks live but community leaders say drugrelated violence in the 
area is worsening anyway some say there are signs of growing gang 
activity patterned after los angelesstyle color gangs 
on christmas eve the body of 35yearold manuel d winslow was 
discovered in an abandoned apartment he had been shot twice in the 
head a man told police he saw two men park a bmw in front of the 
building and take two rifles from the trunk 
on christmas night high school basketball star michael bennett 
18 was fatally shot in the neck as drove in the neighboring 
mattapan section a revolver was in his pocket and a handgun behind 
the drivers seat police believe the shooting was gangrelated 
on the same night inacio mendes 43 was fatally shot as he 
stood in front of a window in his kitchen police said his 
apartment is a block from the street where tiffany was killed and 
where repairmen and taxi drivers sometimes refuse to go 
a police spokesman james jordan said he was certain the gunman 
intended to hit someone else 
were in big trouble here said community leader ben haith of 
the roxbury multiservice center were becoming like la 
boston police spokeswoman jill reilly said any comparison of 
gangs in boston and los angeles is inappropriate los angeles had 
300 gangrelated homicides this year compared with bostons two or 
three she said 
the 30 additional officers assigned to the bustling innercity 
area since tiffanys death are not enough to stop the escalating 
drug trade and a citywide homicide total that has jumped 33 percent 
over last year neighborhood activists said 
haith complained that the citys response has been little more 
than a token while a police cruiser is now usually stationed in a 
vacant lot across the street from where tiffany was shot it rarely 
moves and the officers do not leave the car he said prompting 
neighbors to joke that the cruiser was sent to guard the mailbox 
it just sits there he said the criminals already know 
their routines and they just avoid them 
according to the police report on the mendes killing a youth 
wearing a red cap and red jacket with a yellow stripe across the 
back was seen running near the house immediately after the shooting 
ed brooks who heads the community patrol a group of about 30 
residents who patrol hotspots and report tips to police said the 
clothing description fits that of a gang operating in the area 
brooks said there are signs that los angelesstyle color 
gangs are appearing in boston there are more than a dozen violent 
gangs that sell cocaine crack and heroin carry guns and wear 
different colored hoods or jackets to identify themselves he said 
he warned that gang activity is increasing and if somebody 
dont do something the murders we have now could triple 
we know we can only be nonviolent for so long brooks said 
we dont want to be a vigilante group but i can see in not too 
long there are going to be some folks who want to go out there and 
hurt someone to take our neighborhood back

role in the cultural revolution an official newspaper reported 
today 
the china daily quoted a justice ministry official as saying 
jiang qing is receiving treatment in prison for unspecified diseases 
relating to old age it denied persistent reports she suffers from 
throat cancer 
last week china youth an official monthly said jiang had left 
prison and was being treated in a hospital for throat cancer the 
ministry also denied that report

was branded the chief villainess of the 196676 cultural revolution 
when millions of chinese were persecuted or had their lives 
disrupted by ultraleftist factions 
she was accused of being ringleader of the gang of four that 
tried to seize power after maos death in 1981 she was sentenced 
to death but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1983

chances that president hosni mubarak would be 
the first arab leader to visit israel since anwar sadat have 
diminished over his governments insistence that israel talk first 
to the plo 
israel refuses to engage in any dialogue with the palestine 
liberation organization which it views as a terrorist group 
butros ghali the top cabinet minister and egypts secondranking 
diplomat said tuesday that israel must talk to the plo before 
mubarak will visit the jewish state but israel repeated its demand 
that a mubarak visit be made without preconditions 
egypt always has emphasized the importance of dialogue and 
contact between the plo and israel ghali minister of state for 
foreign affairs told reporters in cairo in light of this 
objective president hosni mubarak is prepared to visit israel if it 
agrees to dialogue with the plo 
government sources supported ghalis statement saying a mubarak 
visit to israel was almost unimaginable unless jerusalem 
reverses its opposition to an international peace conference and 
accepts the plo as a negotiating partner 
in interviews with foreign newspapers last weekend mubarak made 
a qualified offer to travel to israel if it would help achieve peace 
he was quoted as telling the kuwaiti newspaper alanbaa if 
this visit would lead to solving the problem and if it would lead 
to establishing a just peace then i am ready 
the japanese newspaper yomiuri quoted mubarak as saying said he 
would visit israel if the peace prospects appeared good but said he 
would do so without preconditions 
israel responded positively to the offer but prime minister 
yitzhak shamir emphasized the visit would have to be made without 
preconditions from the egyptian side as well he repeated that 
demand tuesday 
i will be happy to receive him mubarak shamir said on 
israel radio but added these visits usually have to be prepared 
with caution not in the limelight and without preconditions 
other israeli officials tried to play down the probability of a 
mubarak visit one israeli foreign ministry official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said mubaraks statement was given much 
more importance than mubarak meant 
ghali was among the architects of the 1979 israeliegyptian peace 
treaty the only one between an arab county and the jewish state he 
has held his ministerial post since sadats daring 1977 visit to 
israel to launch the peace initiative that culminated in the camp 
david accords sadat was assassinated by moslem extremists four 
years later in part because of his peace mission 
in making his statement tuesday ghali cited the initiative 
taken by plo leader yasser arafat in recognizing israels right to 
exist 
arafats explicit recognition of israels right to exist and 
renunciation of terrorism earlier this month led the united states 
to reverse a 13year policy and agree to open a dialogue with the 
plo 
in another development arafat scoffed at an israeli plan to give 
limited autonomy to the palestinians in the occupied territories 
calling it an undesired commodity in a stagnated market 
speaking in iraq after a threeday session of the plo executive 
committee arafat said shamir should understand that he cannot 
sell us camp david after everybody has rejected it he was 
referring to shamirs proposal to grant the west bank and gaza strip 
autonomy as stipulated in the 1979 treaty 
shamir said sunday that israel would work toward an agreement 
with egypt and jordan on selfrule for palestinians in the west bank 
and gaza captured in the 1967 middle east war 
if such an agreement were reached he said he would allow free 
elections for an adminstrative council to run palestinian affairs in 
the territories

president reagan who has worked nearly eight 
years in an ovalshaped office near the potomac river is looking 
forward to settling down in a rectangular one with a view of the 
pacific ocean 
reagan on the fifth day of a twoweek california vacation paid 
his first visit tuesday to the office he will use after his term 
ends jan 20 the office not yet fully furnished is on the top 
floor of a 34story building about five minutes by car from where 
the reagans will live 
reporters were not allowed to accompany the president into the 
building but assistant white house press secretary mark weinberg 
quoted him as saying its a beautiful office with a spectacular 
view and it even has four corners im looking forward to spending 
time there 
the presidents right hand was scratched while unpacking a box of 
books in the office weinberg said after reporters noticed two small 
bandages on his fingers as he waved to them while leaving 
reagan spent about 45 minutes in the office 
weinberg said the president made decisions about the office 
several months ago and the purpose of tuesdays visit was to see 
that the arrangements were made as he wished 
the office is down the hall from the office of the ronald reagan 
presidential foundation which is overseeing construction of the 
reagan presidential library in simi valley northwest of los angeles 
on the same floor are offices for first lady nancy reagan and for 
the secret service 
expenses for former presidents are paid out of a budget provided 
by congress 
the reagans will fly to palm springs on thursday and see the new 
year in as usual at the home of publisher walter annenberg in nearby 
rancho mirage they will return to their future home in los angeles 
on jan 1 and will fly back to washington on jan 5 
on tuesday reagan issued a statement marking the ninth 
anniversary of the soviet invasion of afghanistan he said he 
expects the soviets to live up to their target date of feb 15 for 
withdrawal of all of their troops but added the introduction of 
new weapons and the escalation in the use of soviet warplanes in 
bombing raids against afghanistan call into question the soviet 
commitment to a peaceful solution 
one decision awaiting the president possibly before his return 
to washington is whether to approve or modify the recommendations 
of the commission on executive legislative and judicial salaries 
which call for increases averaging 50 percent for the 2500 top 
officials of the government 
deputy white house press secretary leslye arsht said i dont 
know what the presidents intentions are she said she did not

if you go on a job interview today and are 
asked to take a lie detector test the chances are you would be the 
victim of an illegal act 
the same situation applies if your boss has a polygraph examiner 
come into the warehouse tomorrow to hook wires to randomly selected 
employees and question them about merchandise missing from the 
companys shelves 
it is now illegal across america for most employers in interstate 
commerce to use the controversial polygraph for preemployment 
screening purposes or to use them randomly against workers already 
on their payroll 
these restrictions on lie detectors whose accuracy has long been 
under attack are enumerated in a federal law that took effect 
tuesday six months after it was signed by president reagan 
this is a holiday gift for working people said judy 
goldberg legislative representative for the american civil 
liberties union 
we expect that the new law will ban 80 percent of the 
approximately 2 million polygraph tests given annually goldberg 
said in a prepared statement 
the laws restrictions will be felt most heavily in 28 states 
that lack their own statutes restricting the use of lie detectors 
goldberg said 
not covered by the new rules however are federal state and 
local governments and firms doing sensitive work under contract to 
the defense department fbi and cia 
the only other privatesector exceptions to the general ban apply 
to companies that manufacture distribute or dispense controlled 
substances and some types of firms in the security guard armored 
car or security alarm fields 
the law prohibits an employee from being fired disciplined or 
discriminated against solely for refusing to submit to a polygraph 
examination 
an employer can request an employee to take a lie detector test 
if the worker had access to missing or damaged material and if the 
employer sets forth in a written statement a reasonable suspicion 
that the worker was involved in the loss 
any such polygraph exam would have to be conducted under strict 
conditions with no questions about personal beliefs and sexual 
behavior and the exam results alone could not be used as a basis 
for discipline or a refusal to hire 
complaints about polygraph abuse and firings based on polygraph 
abuse have been one of the single largest sources of calls to aclu 
offices nationwide goldberg said 
now employees can complain to the department of labor or go 
into court to protect themselves against these inaccurate gadgets 
goldberg said 
she said the law would have the greatest impact in alabama 
arizona arkansas colorado florida georgia illinois indiana 
kansas kentucky louisiana mississippi missouri nevada new 
hampshire new mexico new york north carolina north dakota ohio 
oklahoma south carolina south dakota tennessee texas utah 
virginia and wyoming 
goldberg said employers in the following states which allow 
businesses to request people to take lie detector tests could be 
affected by the new law california hawaii idaho maryland 
montana nebraska pennsylvania and wisconsin 
the remaining 14 states and the district of columbia have laws 
banning polygraph examinations for employment purposes and these 
laws take precedence over the new federal statute if they are more 
restrictive according to goldberg

president fidel castros government has 
rejected as absurd and inconceivable a petition by 100 writers 
actors and scientists that he hold a plebiscite to see if the cuban 
people want him to stay in power 
the petition had asked castro to hold an yesorno referendum as 
chilean leader augusto pinochet did earlier this year after forces 
opposed to pinochet won the plebiscite pinochet said he would step 
down in 1990 
foreign ministry spokesman rolando perez del amo rejected the 
petition in a statement quoted in a dispatch from havana by the 
official cuban news agency prensa latina 
it is absurd and inconceivable to establish a comparision 
between cuba and the fascist regime of augusto pinochet in chile 
the news service quoted perez del amo as saying 
perez del amo referred to the letter during a press conference 
held in havana dealing with the 30th anniversary of the triumph of 
the cuban revolution on jan 1 
the cuban people held a grand plebiscite concerning their 
destiny 30 years ago and they repeat that action every day with 
their decision to continue with socialism prensa latina 
monitored in mexico city quoted perez del amo as saying 
perez del amos declaration was the first official reaction of 
cubas communist leadership to the letter which appeared in mexico 
city newspapers on tuesday 
according to the newspapers the letter was sent from paris to 
havana and addressed to castro it exhorted castro to hold the 
plebiscite to let the people of cuba express their agreement or 
rejection of his continued leadership 
among those who signed were nobel prize winners jean dausset and 
andre l wolff in medicine and saul bellow in literature they 
also included italian filmmaker federico fellini french actors yves 
montand and gerard depardieu and writers mario vargas llosa of peru 
octavio paz of mexico eugene ionesco of france and susan sontag of 
the united states 
whether you triumph or not mr president castro you should 
make a step toward democracy and in the shortest time possible call 
elections so that the cuban people can freely elect their leaders 
reads the letter 
paz told the official mexican government news service notimex on 
tuesday that he and the others who signed the letter did not intend 
to compare the cuban and chilean governments 
it is a bit silly that the cuban government says that the 
countrys plebiscite was held 30 years ago notimex quoted paz as 
saying the people dont marry leaders for their entire 
rulerships

a us motorist pulls into a service station 
and plunks down 105 for a gallon of gasoline in britain the same 
amount of gas would cost the equivalent of 277 
why the difference 
british motorists and drivers in many other european countries 
pay taxes accounting for approximately half of the price of gasoline 
at the pump making it a luxury item for many 
some now believe the modest us federal gas tax of 9 cents a 
gallon could be headed in the same direction 
we are about to follow the europeans down the road of no 
return says bill berman director of energy and environment for 
the american automobile association 
he also heads a newly formed umbrella group called fuel users for 
equitable levies fuel which last week launched a grassroots 
campaign to offset mounting pressure for a gas tax increase as a way 
of reducing the nations 155 billion budget deficit the antitax 
lobby is supported by such groups as the american farm bureau 
federation and the american petroleum institute 
no gas tax increase is imminent but with policymakers desperate 
for some solution to the deficit the debate is in full swing 
critics say a tax increase would mean slower business higher 
inflation and fewer jobs 
supporters retort that a higher tax would calm international 
deficit jitters and thus strengthen the economy in the long run as 
an added benefit they claim it would reduce americas growing 
dependence on foreign oil by curbing demand for gasoline 
the effort must now be made to get the deficit down former 
federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said in calling for an 
increase in the tax 
presidentelect bush is opposed to a higher gas tax but the idea 
has drawn support from witnesses before the 14member national 
economic commission created by congress to search for deficit 
remedies 
each pennypergallon of additional tax would yield 1 billion in 
revenue that makes it seem an attractively quick way to sharply 
reduce the budget deficit 
business is divided within the auto industry chrysler corp 
chairman lee iacocca supports a tax increase but general motors 
corp is stoutly opposed to it on grounds that it would hammer the 
economy ford motor co is hesitant on the issue but has said it 
could support a phased increase of 5 cents per gallon per year 
the roadbuilding lobby led by the associated general 
contractors opposes a tax increase on grounds that the additional 
revenue would go to cutting the budget deficit instead of expanding 
the 14 billion federal highway trust fund there is no assurance 
that the additional tax collections would be used for trimming the 
deficit however if the money were channeled into general revenues 
in congress southwesterners are cool to anything that would 
reduce demand for gasoline at a time when energyproducing economies 
back home are feeling the pain of depressed oil prices 
i hope they are able to avoid any new tax including a gasoline 
tax sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said in a statement 
as chairman of the taxwriting senate finance committee bentsen 
would have much to say about the matter 
across capitol hill at the taxwriting house ways and means 
committee the picture is different chairman dan rostenkowski 
dill has been smiling on the idea of a gas tax increase although 
his last attempt to push one through failed on the house floor 
it was good economic policy and good energy policy 
rostenkowski told a wall street group recently it was not good 
politics 
rostenkowski now says its up to bush to take the initiative on 
the gas tax issue but he adds that a tax boost would be on the 
agenda if he had his druthers 
some critics of the idea say a gas tax increase would fall 
unfairly on westerners and farmers some of whom must drive longer 
distances to take care of essential needs 
the billions of dollars in new revenue would not come from 
the population as a whole but only from those men and women who have 
no choice but to drive their cars to get to jobs to stores to 
purchase food and other essentials to take children to schools and 
to otherwide conduct their daily routines says former federal 
highway administrator ray a barnhart 
capitol hill tax watchers caution that if lawmakers turn to a gas 
tax increase it is unlikely to come as an unadorned standalone 
issue instead they say it is more likely to be part of a complex 
compromise package with incentives to serve as sales points and 
offset any charge of regional bias

the government approved a new prescription drug 
intended to help arthritis sufferers avoid getting potentially 
lifethreatening ulcers from their arthritis medicine 
we think it is a very important drug arthritis foundation 
spokesman peter mathon said tuesday shortly after the food and drug 
administration announced its approval 
to be sold under the trade name cytotec by gd searle of skokie 
ill the drug misoprostol is for use by patients at high risk 
for developing complications of stomach ulcers while on arthritis 
drugs 
the fda said that includes the elderly and patients of any age 
with other serious illness 
in those patients the fda said the ulcers may go undetected 
until they have caused bleeding or other serious consequences 
the foundations position is that when properly used it can 
reduce mortality among people with arthritis mathon the 
atlantabased arthritis foundations vice president for public 
affairs said in a telephone interview 
he noted that the drug has potential benefit for all 37 million 
americans with arthritis even those not now on antiinflammatory 
drugs 
the fda said there are an estimated 200000 cases of 
gastrointestinal bleeding each year due to the 68 million 
prescriptions of nonsterodial antiinflammatory drugs called 
nsaids used for arthritis it estimated there are 10000 to 20000 
deaths a year associated with such bleeding 
among the most commonly used nsaids are highdose aspirin 
ibuprofen piroxicam and naproxen 
until now we have had no drug that could prevent nsaidinduced 
ulcers said fda commissioner frank e young since these ulcers 
are sometimes lifethreatening this drug should save lives as well 
as costly hospitalizations 
the drug should also permit elderly debilitated or ulcerprone 
patients to continue arthritis therapies they might otherwise have 
to interrupt young added in a statement announcing the approval 
misoprostol is a copy of a natural substance found in the human 
body that regulates acid secretions of the stomach it suppresses 
gastric acid secretion and replaces natural substances called tissue 
prostaglandins that have been depleted by nsaids 
antiabortion activists had urged that the fda not approve the 
drug because it can cause changes in muscle tone including muscles 
of the uterus that can cause miscarriages 
the fda is requiring labeling to prescribing physicians and their 
patients to state the drug is not for use in women of childbearing 
potential unless the patient must receive nonsteroidal 
antiinflammatory drugs and is at high risk of complications from 
gastric ulcers associated with use of the nsaid 
for these young women the labeling requires physicians to obtain 
a negative pregnancy test before prescribing misoprostol and to 
ensure that the patient has been informed of the need to avoid 
getting pregnant while taking the drug 
the fda approval also stipulated that the drug will be 
distributed only in a consumer package that contains the cautionary 
language 
however once a drug is approved by the fda the agency loses 
control over how doctors actually prescribe it as a practical 
matter however doctors generally are reluctant to knowingly 
prescribe a drug especially a new drug outside fda guidelines 
because they fear it could be raised against them in the event of a 
malpractice claim 
acknowledging some controversy surrounding the drug the 
arthritis foundations mathon said any drug has to be used 
carefully and responsibly administered by physicians to be sure 
people are using and benefiting from it properly

the number of refugees arriving in the united 
states is likely to top 100000 in 1989 for the first time since 
1982 according to the us committee on refugees 
the peak year for refugees was 1980 when 207116 arrived in this 
country 
court robinson a policy analyst for the refugee committee said 
he expects the total to exceed 100000 next year although us law 
will allow no more than 94000 to get formal refugee status which 
entitles them to a wide range of services including english lessons 
such services cost taxpayers about 2000 for each refugee in the 
first year after arrival and often additional thousands in following 
years a precise figure cannot be calculated robinson said in an 
interview tuesday 
in addition attorney general dick thornburgh said on dec 8 that 
as many as 2000 immigrants a month will be admitted from the soviet 
union with parole status this status allows them to get jobs 
but they must pay their own fares and get legal documents from 
sponsors in the united states who promise not to let them become a 
charge on the public they also find it harder to become citizens 
robinson said 
his committee is a private group financed by foundations and 
other contributors 
the us government grants refugee status only to those it 
considers to be in danger of prosecution in their homelands 
although some arrive in this country without official approval 
many more than the usual number of refugees are expected in 1989 
from soviet armenia in addition to increased numbers of soviet 
jews because of the devastating earthquake in armenia last month 
and continued racial strife in the region 
the national conference on soviet jewry reports that 2234 jews 
left the soviet union in november the highest figure in nine years 
it put the total at 15640 for the first 11 months of 1988 
larger numbers of refugees have been coming from indochina 
according to the immigration and naturalization service its figures 
show that between october 1987 and august of this year 19962 were 
approved from vietnam 15062 from laos and 3916 from cambodia 
refugees who reach this country without official approval can ask 
for asylum in the year that ended last sept 30 asylum was granted 
in 5531 cases about half of those granted asylum 2786 were 
from nicaragua

taxpayers who unknowingly contributed a 
substantial chunk to president reagans last inauguration may be off 
the hook this time at least for the cost of exclusive events they 
couldnt attend 
under new direction from congress the pentagon intends to seek 
reimbursement for its services and supplies for private events at 
presidentelect bushs inauguration the private presidential 
inaugural committee intends to pay that tab 
in 1985 seven federal agencies spent nearly 16 million on the 
reagan festivities with the defense department accounting for 10 
million 
three weeks before the inaugural period begins the committee has 
yet to tell the pentagon how many military men and women it will 
need for its galas celebrations and other activities 
but capt gail hayes of the armed forces inaugural committee said 
her committee does not anticipate a decline in the number of people 
it will be asked to detail to inaugural duties 
our best estimate is that dod participation will be 8500 
people she said the same as in 1985 
while the participation level could be equally high the bill to 
taxpayers should not 
tucked deep in the defense authorization act for fiscal 1989 is a 
paragraph saying the defense secretary should seek reimbursement for 
troops used at private inaugural events and only volunteers should 
be used at such events it was sought by outgoing sen william 
proxmire dwis wellknown for his efforts to curb what he 
considers wasteful spending 
proxmire was moved by a general accounting office report last 
year that detailed federal spending on the 1985 inauguration and 
noted that soldiers had been used sometimes unwillingly as 
chauffeurs photographers and escorts 
ron tammen proxmires administrative assistant said the new 
policy is meant to relieve military people of chores such as driving 
vip spouses to beauty parlors and to restrict federal subsidies of 
balls and other events he described as virtual political payoffs 
we specifically meant to prevent the use of the military at 
balls and galas which are exclusively to entertain the vips 
bush supporters and republicans tammen said 
despite some confusion about the provision at the pentagon and 
the inaugural committee both say they will heed the guidelines 
the department of defense does intend to seek reimbursement 
where appropriate for support rendered said hayes defining 
where appropriate as meaning private events 
well make sure that we comply said stephen studdert 
executive director of the presidential inaugural committee 
studdert said it had not been determined which inaugural events 
would be considered private as opposed to public but general 
counsel jan baran said an event is considered public if 50 percent 
of the tickets are available to the public and by that standard 
about onethird of two dozen activities are public 
among the open events are a parade a pageant a childrens 
festival an american tribute to democracy and a thanksgiving 
service at washington cathedral there are more than a dozen private 
events including nine balls a worship service a dinner a gala a 
vice presidential reception a salute to the first lady and a 
celebration for young americans 
pic and pentagon officials were unclear about how much the 
pentagon can expect to be repaid or what impact the new policy will 
have on the inaugural committees 20 to 25 million budget 
its hard to measure said studdert it may not add on to 
the overall cost we may save on other categories by increasing 
volunteer use thats our hope

the agriculture department still wants to scrap 
its 26yearold scrapie eradication program but it is giving 
opponents another two months to scrape together arguments on why it 
shouldnt 
the department said in a federal register notice on tuesday that 
it was extending for another 60 days or until march 6 the period 
for public comment on its proposal last month to dismantle the 
scrapie program 
the cooperative federalstate program was begun in 1952 in an 
effort to contain and eventually eradicate scrapie which is a 
degenerative and fatal disease that attacks the central nervous 
systems of sheep and goats 
james w glosser administrator of usdas animal and plant health 
and inspection service said researchers have yet to produce a cure 
or even a diagnostic test for the disease 
also the eradication effort calling for infected or exposed 
animals to be destroyed is not required by the law making the 
program dependent on accurate reporting by flock owners 
the intent and goals are laudable glosser said but it is 
questionable whether we have the technology or regulatory framework 
to administer an eradication program at this time 
although there is no evidence that scrapie poses a human health 
hazard it is nearly always fatal to infected animals the disease 
has an incubation period of 18 months to 42 months and can be 
transmitted before the appearance of symptoms such as debilitation 
unsteady gait and rubbing or scratching to relieve intense itching 
since there is no diagnostic test for confirming the presence of 
scrapie in live animals final confirmation of it in dead ones 
requires an examination of their brain tissue 
under the current voluntary program animals reported as infected 
or exposed are supposed to be destroyed and remaining animals in the 
flock are to be held under surveillance for 42 months

implementation of the uscanada free trade 
agreement on jan 1 will have a modest effect initially on american 
poultry producers but a more significant one later on an american 
producers group says 
the canadian house of commons approved the accord on saturday 
and the senate is expected follow suit by the end of this week 
allowing the agreement to go into effect on schedule the us 
congress gave its approval earlier this year 
canada will keep its basic poultry quotas in place but they will 
be enlarged slightly to permit the possibility of increased exports 
from the united states the national broiler council said tuesday 
currently canada allows the poultry imports equal to 63 percent 
of its previous years domestic chicken production under the new 
trade agreement that figure rises to not less than 75 percent 
the increase of 12 percentage points represents no change in 
reality since that is the amount of additional chicken canada has 
been importing in recent years under supplemental quota provisions 
but all poultry product tariffs will be reduced in equal 
increments over the next 10 years under the accord with binding 
arbitration panels to resolve any antidumping or countervailing 
duty cases that may arise 
the trade liberalization also removes quotas on poultry products 
that are combined with other food ingredients such as frozen 
chicken dinners however they may still be subject to import duties

it was only natural that at age 39 
twins yvonne and yvette mccarther would leave their mother who 
lovingly taught them to think of themselves as individuals 
so the women siamese twins joined at the head wonder why 
anybody else would find their decision unusual 
im 39 and i always said i was going to move into my own place 
by the time i was 40 said yvette i mean when you get to be in 
your late 30s you just decide its time to get your own place 
yvonne agreed 
i only wish id gotten around to it before i love it being 
on my own she said 
medical science calls the women craniopagus twins the rarest 
kind of siamese birth they have separate brains and personalities 
but share a bloodstream 
their mother willie mccarther of compton taught her daughters 
to think of themselves as separate beings and theyve learned the 
lesson well 
last year they took classes at compton community college 
creating a stir they greeted more with bemusement than anything else 
their new home is a tiny apartment in suburban north long beach 
with one bedroom that rents for 510 a month paid for with close 
budgeting of government checks 
one the top of their television set is an autographed photo of 
ronnie and donnie galyon 37 the only other known pair of living 
adult siamese twins joined together 
the galyons tour with a circus as the mcarthurs did in early 
years in order to pay hospital bills their mother ruled out surgery 
to separate them fearing one would die 
yvette said it took her weeks to find her new apartment 
i saw one in compton i liked but it was so expensive i told 
the guy it would have to wait till i got married she giggled 
better see if hes got a brother deadpanned yvonne

a top air force official has been accused by 
federal investigators of receiving payments and other gratuities 
in exchange for helping a defense consultant and contractors 
according to a report published today 
victor d cohen deputy assistant air force secretary in charge 
of buying tactical command control communications and computer 
systems used his official position to help consultant william 
galvin and his clients including unisys corp loral electronic 
systems division and cubic corp the washington post reported 
cohens participation has ranged from providing galvins 
clients with proprietary information to structuring procurements in 
a manner that eliminates competition said an affidavit unsealed 
tuesday the document was filed in court last june and was released 
by a federal magistrate in hyattsville md in response to a 
lawsuit by the post 
cohens assistance to galvins clients can clearly be traced to 
illegal payments and gratuities provided to him by galvin or the 
clients said the affidavit which was filed to support a search 
of cohens house in potomac md the affidavit apparently gave no 
total but mentions that an earlier investigation of cohen revealed 
a 2500 check from galvin to cohen in january 1982 
cohens attorney seymour glanzer did not answer a telephone 
call to his home late tuesday night the post said galvins attorney 
also was not available for comment 
prosecutors have said they have evidence that consultants 
including some former highlevel reagan administration officials and 
former highranking military men who work for the nations largest 
defense contractors bribed pentagon officials for information 
vital to winning contracts worth billions of dollars 
there have been no indictments in the case which was revealed in 
june when fbi agents raided more than 40 locations those locations 
included cohens home and office as well as the offices of galvin 
and his stepson kenneth f brooke cohen whose phone was tapped 
has been relieved of contracting responsibilities as have four 
other pentagon employees who have been subjects of the more than 
twoyear investigation 
the cohen affidavit indicates that cubic president colvin 
wellborn had complained to galvin that cohen had stalled for six 
months on providing an acquisition plan 
cohens willingness to assist cubic in obtaining government 
contracts can be traced to what is believed to be the receipt of a 
payment from cubic the affidavit said 
two other affidavits also were released tuesday in hyattsville 
one alleged that investigation of unisys activities 
demonstrates that former unisys vice president and later company 
consultant charles gardner and others have sought to corruptly 
influence congressional legislation on defense programs through 
payment of monies and gratuities to selected congressmen 
that affidavit concerned the search of the home of richard 
seelmeyer a former aide to the late rep joseph a addabbo dny 
seelmeyer of berwyn heights md operated an airplane unisys used 
to provide flights for members of congress 
charles fc ruff a unisys lawyer told the post he had 
absolutely no knowledge of or any comment about any attempt to 
corruptly influence or the payment of gratuities to any 
congressmen 
the affidavit refers to wiretapped conversations in which 
gardner has made references on several occasions that if seelmeyer 
was to talk he could do a lot of damage in particular in reference 
to congressman roy dysons trip to new york in may 1988 in which 
seelmeyer apparently had a role in planning 
i didnt have any role in making that trip seelmeyer told 
the post i knew they were going up there but that was it 
dyson dmd has denied that there was any impropriety in his 
trip to new york during which he visited a unisys facility 
dyson and several other congressmen were mentioned early in the 
case prompting a visit to capitol hill by us attorney henry e 
hudson who is running the investigation 
members of congress who attended the closed meeting said later 
that no congressman was a target of the investigation but hudson 
said in october that he never made such a statement he said he 
only told them that no member of congress had been the subject of 
electronic surveillance had received a subpoena to testify in front 
of the grand jury at that time or had been the subject of a search 
warrant 
the third affidavit unsealed tuesday the post said supported 
the search of the rockville md home and office of consultant bill 
sanda who allegedly worked with consultant william parkin to 
provide inside information to unisys and other defense contractors 
parkin also has been the subject of searches 
a source said in november that parkin would be among the first 
people charged in the pentagon bribery case unless he comes in and 
cuts a deal which he is not going to do 
parkin has told reporters that he believes he broke no laws in 
running his alexandria va consulting business

in poignant letters from prison one of chinas 
most famous dissidents sent his wife kisses and advised his sickly 
daughter to get more sun and exercise 
did you have a happy birthday xu wenli wrote his daughter in 
one of five letters obtained by the associated press on tuesday 
in another he wrote gleefully i had a great weekend because i 
got six letters 
xus letters dated since april and sent to his family in beijing 
from beijings no 1 prison are his only contact with the outside 
since he was barred from having visitors in 1985 four years into a 
15year sentence for counterrevolutionary activity 
xu 43 has spent much of the time in solitary confinement 
the former electrician was among the leaders of chinas 197879 
democracy wall movement during which deng xiaoping newly in power 
tolerated unprecedented open calls for multiparty democracy and 
other reforms 
but in early 1979 his position in the ruling communist party 
consolidated deng ordered a crackdown on the dozens of unofficial 
journals that had sprung up and he ended the democracy wall itself 
a brick wall in beijing where outspoken posters went up daily 
xu mimeographed the underground magazine april fifth forum in his 
home in which he argued that a multiparty system was not 
antimarxist and would help the socialist cause he was arrested in 
1981 and convicted the following year 
his letters addressed to his wife qang tong and 16yearold 
daughter xu jingjing said nothing about his own condition 
instead he sent a steady stream of questions and advice 
to the daughter who has been ill for several years with a bad 
back he wrote on oct 28 you should improve your daily 
nutrition exercise daily and make a study plan after you make your 
plans tell me or i will worry 
did you have a happy birthday no matter how tired how busy 
you are try to squeeze time to sing listen to music play 
badminton and then you will be happier and the back pain will be 
less when youre recovered youll be jumping around like a 
rabbit 
to his wife a teacher he wrote your school is too far away 
try not to bicycle if possible when you go home after school 
is there anyone to accompany you 
he closed im kissing you my dear 
in the most recent letter dated dec 2 xu wrote regarding 
your letter of nov 12 never mind the contents the mere fact that 
its already four pages causes tears of happiness to cover my face 
he also wrote of his pride in his wife and daughter adding 
because of you and for you i can be at peace and accept what 
fate sends 
xu also expressed concern for his family in a selfdefense 
smuggled from prison in 1985 publication of the essay in western 
periodicals caused authorities to cancel his visitor privileges 
ren wanding a fellow participant in the democracy wall movement 
who was jailed for four years said xu was allowed to send a 
twopage letter about once every two months 
ren who was released in 1983 remained silent until november 
when he gave foreign reporters a long essay on the democracy wall 
movement also called the beijing spring 
in a new essay released tuesday ren declared the 12 months 
beginning in november beijing spring memorial year and said his 
goal was to draw international attention to the plight of his jailed 
friends 
more than a dozen leaders of the movement remain jailed the most 
famous is wei jingsheng who pleaded for democracy as a fifth 
modernization to go along with the governments program of 
improving agriculture industry science and the military 
although the communist party has encouraged greater openness on 
selected topics including disclosure of official corruption calls 
for any change in the partys ruling role remain forbidden 
sporadic calls by students for democracy have been suppressed 
including a series of massive nationwide demonstrations in the 
winter of 198687 
in his latest essay ren appealed to presidentelect george bush 
who served as us liaison officer to china in 197475 
if you are really concerned about chinese affairs then i ask 
you to first of all be concerned about the dzmoracy wall personages 
who benefited chinas social development and opening up they have 
been discriminated against and watched by your friendly chinese 
government ren wrote 
aside from ren chinas only dissident willing to be quoted as 
demanding multiparty democracy is internationally known 
astrophysicist fang lizhi who believes his fame has shielded him 
ren a littleknown accountant said he was not so confident but 
that he hoped publicity would be a shield 
i dont want china to copy western systems or western 
democracy he said in an interview china can work out its own 
democracy chinas economic liberalization inevitably must lead to 
greater political freedom

some restaurateurs have to struggle to stay 
afloat george butch corne would just like to refloat his 
restaurant which sank to the bottom of the ohio river 
corne said his floating restaurant fischermans wharf sank 
during the weekend after it apparently was struck by a boat 
theres nothing we can do until the water goes down and we can 
check it for holes said vickie jenkins manager of fischermans 
wharf this is under water like as in all the things inside are 
floating around 
the water was expected to crest today corne said at this 
point we think weve been hit it sank too fast 
he suspects a sizable hole in the 135by35 foot barge because 
pumps on it would have been able to contain a small leak 
corne also will take a personal bath on the mess he said he is 
selfinsured and estimated the damage at 300000 
fischermans wharf sat on a wooden barge along the ohio about 10 
miles east of evansville it took the unusual spelling of its name 
from the barges previous owner randall fischer an attached steel 
barge contains crawdaddys bar and grill designed for pleasure 
boaters 
its sticking 6 inches out of the water corne said of 
crawdaddys 
the wooden barge sank once before then it was turned into a 
restaurant in the fall of 1987 and closed just one month later when 
corne discovered his insurance company was not covering the 
restaurant after corne got liability insurance the barge reopened 
in may 1988 with the addition of the bar and grill 
if the barge can be salvaged corne said he would reopen the 
steak and seafood restaurant 
although hes disappointed corne said hes trying to keep his 
head above water its just one of those things he said im 
not going to let that get me down

joe hooper has nothing 
the most decorated us soldier of the vietnam war lies nearly 
forgotten near the tomb of the unknowns at arlington national 
cemetery another symbol of a war the nation would just as soon 
forget 
in washington state where hooper grew up and lived much of his 
life there is no individual monument to his memory and the deeds 
that won him 37 citations including the medal of honor 
plans to rename various public buildings or parks after hooper 
have been in the works for years it isnt that anyone is opposed to 
them but more often they seem to stall for lack of interest 
that may soon change 
rep rod chandler rwash plans to introduce a bill in january 
to rename the substanceabuse wing of the veterans administration 
hospital in seattle after the man who won the nations highest 
military honor plus two silver stars and 11 purple hearts 
the office of sen brock adams dwash is leading a separate 
drive to get the va to do the same thing without congress having to 
pass a bill 
and some efforts have started in moses lake where hooper grew 
up to rename a city park or erect a memorial to him 
why has it taken so long 
the unpopularity of the war has shifted over to a bias against 
the individuals who served in the war speculated jim gunsolus 
the adams aide working on the hooper effort 
part of the reason may have been hooper himself who drank his 
way out of the military and a variety of jobs after the war failed 
to play the part of war hero for the government and died from a 
fall in a motel room in kentucky in 1979 at age 40 
donald ross a medal of honor historian in port orchard who knew 
hooper well said a small number of recipients are unable to live 
and honor the medal of honor 
he was one of them said ross who served at pearl harbor and 
is a medal of honor winner himself it was too much of a load for 
him 
another friend said hooper couldnt bear what he witnessed as an 
employee of the va hospital in seattle 
it just got too much for him and he couldnt stand all the 
misery around here said joe feldman of the american legion in 
seattle 
hoopers peacetime life was in sharp contrast to his 30 months in 
vietnam 
the medal of honor citation covering six hours of combat near 
hue on feb 21 1968 relates astonishing exploits killing two 
dozen enemy rescuing six of his men and suffering seven wounds 
hooper then a 29yearold sergeant crossed a river through 
enemy fire and with his men overran several bunkers he then ran 
into heavy gunfire to help his wounded men suffering serious wounds 
but refusing medical treatment 
then he singlehandedly stormed three enemy bunkers destroying 
them with hand grenades and rifle fire and also killing two enemy 
soldiers who had attacked his units chaplain 
leading his men forward hooper destroyed three buildings housing 
enemy riflemen and killed a north vietnamese officer with his 
bayonet 
his initial wounds now compounded by grenade fragments hooper 
raced down a small trench hurling hand grenades to destroy four 
enemy bunkers 
he then ran across an open field still under enemy fire to 
rescue a wounded man upon reaching that man hooper was attacked by 
an enemy soldier and killed him with a pistol 
he then killed three north vietnamese officers with rifle fire 
reorganized his men and did not consent to evacuation until the 
following morning 
what the citation doesnt say is that 189 us soldiers began the 
river crossing and hooper was among just 14 who survived 
hospitalized for his wounds he broke out of the hospital to 
return to his unit in the next two days hooper and 10 other 
soldiers ambushed 600 enemy fighters earning him a silver star and 
another bullet wound 
hooper was discharged shortly after but found civilian life 
boring and reenlisted a few months later 
the army which had been unable to locate him after the 
discharge awarded hooper the medal of honor and he became a 
celebrity 
he served in los angeles as a recruiter and in the panama canal 
zone as a courier but things went badly and he opted to rejoin the 
101st airborne in vietnam 
he won a second silver star and more medals received a 
battlefield commission to lieutenant and ultimately returned to the 
united states to work at a basic training company 
but he didnt like being an officer and eventually resigned 
ending 18 years of service that began in 1956 when he enlisted in 
the navy 
he returned to the yakima area where friends said he was often 
drinking and carrying a pistol he also was arthritic and suffered 
60 percent disability because of his wounds 
friends tried to help hooper with jobs and support but he often 
failed to show up for work before his fatal fall in a louisville 
motel room on may 6 1979 ross said 
i know it was alcoholrelated ross said 
hooper who left behind a wife and a daughter was buried at 
arlington with full military honors his name was put on a plaque 
honoring all washington medal of honor winners at the state capital 
in olympia 
other than that he was mostly forgotten 
both york and murphy the most decorated us serviceman of world 
war ii have va hospitals named after them 
people look at audie murphy and people like that and these guys 
are national heroes said steve witter a chandler spokesman 
its appropriate that hooper be recognized for what he did

gms nowdead xbody cars were trumpeted in the 
1980 model year as the first of a new breed of fuelefficient models 
from detroit but a consumers guide says the cars prompted owners 
to complain like no other american car built in the 1980s 
jack gillis the principal author of the 1989 edition of the 
car book which was released tuesday said the xcars were 
probably the worst cars ever produced in the united states 
gillis guide first produced in 1981 for the government but now 
being issued as a private venture for the first time this year 
classifies cars according to owners complaints lodged with the 
national highway traffic safety administration 
those government figures show 15 cars with no complaints at all 
nine japanese names four us models a swede and a german 
the book classifies autos as simply good average or 
poor according to whether a car ranked in the top middle or 
bottom third of the list of complaints per million cars similar 
classifications are made in a companion volume the used car 
book 
in a news release accompanying the car book gillis listed 
actual complaint rates for the 26 best and 26 worst models 
the xcars occupied four of the worst seven slots 
before production ended after the 1985 model year the xcars 
chevrolet citation pontiac phoenix oldsmobile omega and buick 
skylark were the subject of a massive 1983 lawsuit by the 
government seeking a 4 million fine from general motors corp and a 
recall of 1980 xcar models to modify rear brakes that federal 
regulators said could lock and cause a spin 
gm which already had recalled the cars twice to fix the brakes 
won the lawsuit in 1987 with the judge ruling there was no 
engineering evidence of any peculiar property of the xcar generally 
that renders them in any way exceptional 
asked whether publicity over the lawsuit might not have prompted 
complaints about the xcars that otherwise would not have been 
lodged gillis said i think it all washes out look at the suzuki 
samurai 
consumers union has criticized the samurai utility vehicle for 
what the organization said was a tendency to roll over in hard 
turns the criticism attracted wide publicity earlier this year yet 
the samurai was third from the bottom in complaints with a 
complaint rate of only 8 per million 
in detroit gm spokesman chuck licari said company officials in a 
position to comment on the xcar complaint rate were not in their 
offices because of the holidays 
according to gillis here are the 26 worst cars complaint rates

oscarwinner hal ashby who directed the 
1970s classics coming home being there and harold and 
maude was remembered upon his death as a genius for finding the 
humor and beauty in the most unlikely places 
ashby died of liver cancer at age 59 at his home tuesday as he 
was preparing to direct a film of truman capotes hand carved 
coffins said his business manager larry reynolds 
colleagues praised ashby as a director who created visually 
striking images gave his star actors and fanciful stories the 
stage while he graciously disappeared into the shadows 
along with coming home the antiwar vietnam story starring 
jane fonda and jon voight ashby turned out a string of highly 
individualistic and idiosyncratic hits during the 1970s they 
included shampoo the last detail harold and maude 
being there and bound for glory 
from jack nicholsons foulmouthed sailor in the last detail 
to warren beattys oversexed hair stylist in shampoo ashby 
encouraged critically acclaimed performances 
at his best he seemed to understand instinctively themes that 
touched audiences 
his 1972 harold and maude became a cult classic that captured 
the anxiety of becoming an adult while coming home a multiple 
academy awardwinner in 1978 gripped a nation ready to reexamine 
vietnam 
coming home a story of a paraplegics return from vietnam 
won oscars for fonda and voight bruce dern playing a traumatized 
marine officer was nominated for best supporting actor as was 
ashby for best director 
even with serious issues ashby found laughter 
hal had a genius for finding the humor and beauty in the most 
unlikely places said bud cort who starred in harold and 
maude the black satire about a suicidal young man who falls for a 
geriatric swinger played by the late ruth gordon 
he created an atmosphere of trust and affection that was 
unparalleled for me cort said i feel blessed to have known 
hal he had a lot of love to give and were all the richer for it 
in the mid1970s ashby was one of hollywoods more consistent 
artists directing peter sellers as a slightly retarded gardener 
elevated to the role of presidential adviser in being there and 
david carradine as folk singer woody guthrie in bound for glory 
toward the end of his career ashbys fortunes waned as he turned 
out such undistinguished features as the sluggers wife 
lookin to get out and eight million ways to die early in 
the 1980s he shrugged off rumors that he and his career were dying 
i cant recall the last thing i heard about myself that was 
true he said in a 1982 interview 
ashby described himself as an optimist i basically have a very 
positive philosophy on life because i dont feel i have anything to 
lose most things are going to turn out ok 
he was a gentle human being and his genteel humor will be 
missed said actor randy quaid who starred as a slowwitted navy 
prisoner on the way to the brig in the last detail quaid also 
was featured in bound for glory 
he inspired me as a man and as a director 
ashby was also a gifted editor winning a 1967 academy award for 
his work on the southernracial drama in the heat of the night 
directed by norman jewison and starring sidney poitier and rod 
steiger 
his editing collaboration with jewison also was seen in the 
cincinnati kid and the russians are coming the russians are 
coming 
ashby who was born in 1929 in ogden utah hitchhiked to 
southern california in 1950 he soon became an apprentice editor at 
the republic and disney studios he later became an assistant to 
editor robert swink collaborating on the editing of the big 
country the diary of anne frank and the greatest story ever 
told 
he directed his first film the landlord with beau bridges 
and pearl bailey in 1970 
ashby is survived by a sister ardith thompson and a brother 
jack a memorial service by the directors guild of america was 
planned for friday

inventor larry johnston has found out 
the hard way that breaking into the board game game is no snap 
but he hopes his latest effort the blue light special will land 
him on boardwalk 
or thereabouts 
by modeling his new game on k marts famous shopping incentive 
johnston got the chain of discount stores to distribute it 
nationwide major toy manufacturers such as parker bros and milton 
bradley rarely accept unsolicited proposals 
the blue light special is a standard board game in which the 
player tosses a die selects a card and moves the blue light icon 
around the board 
everybody knows what a k mart blue light is johnston said 
you mention a blue light special and people will tell you stories 
about getting run over by shopping carts 
k mart announces 15 and 20minute specials over loudspeakers and 
uses policestyle lights mounted on carts to pinpoint sale 
merchandise 
k mart spokeswoman teri kula says the chain is selling the game 
in 800 of its 2200 stores although no sales figures were 
available she said response was pretty good johnston estimates 
hes sold the chain 10000 copies of the game 
johnston promoted his first game the big chicken game by 
wearing a chicken suit outside the landmark big chicken restaurant 
in marietta that inspired it 
he and his wife evelyn have borrowed from banks friends and 
relatives to cover the tens of thousands of dollars they have 
invested in their games since moving to georgia from california in 
1983 
i guess im still a kid at heart he said

a fractured collarbone turned into a lucky 
break for tim moore 
his bicycle accident inspired an invention that could keep riders 
on the seat when they pedal over bicyclegrabbing sewer grates 
moore learned the lesson in april 1987 when he took the new 
bicycle he had purchased for his 15yearold son and came 
facetoface with a bikegrabber 
i had my arm in a sling and my face was all chewed up moore 
recalled recently 
he immediately began devising a way to eliminate the danger and 
with the help of a toolanddie maker came up with a highdensity 
polyethylene grid that is bolted onto iron grates making it 
impossible for a bicycle wheel to lodge between the grates 
i talked to several cities to see what the options were i 
found it was very expensive for cities to replace old castiron 
grates some cities had tried welding strips of metal across but 
there was nothing out there that was costeffective and easy to 
install he said 
the grid is resistant to road salts and chemicals tough enough 
to withstand high temperatures and wont chip when scraped with a 
snow plow moore said 
weve discovered theres a huge market for it he said 
castron grates cost about 85 each to replace and we sell our 
grate covers for about 25 were the only ones out there with an 
economical way of fitting just about any size grate 
the city of rock island gave moore a big boost when it agreed to 
invest in the grate cover which he has patented 
we bought a couple thousand about 18 months ago and they work 
fine said bob hawes director of public works we have about 
4000 sewer grates in the city and every year we had several claims 
and lawsuits from people who got hurt riding their bicycles across 
them 
the only snag in development moore said came when he needed to 
test his invention he just couldnt force himself to ride across a 
sewer grate again with the memory of his last trip still fresh in 
mind 
i had postgrate syndrome and just couldnt bring myself to 
do it he said laughing i had my son ride across it instead

a grassroots group seeking to build a center 
devoted to the memory of the millions of victims of stalinist crimes 
is angrily accusing communist authorities of trying to coopt their 
movement and limit its scope 
on tuesday leading cultural and academic figures working with 
the group condemned the culture ministry for announcing a design 
competition for a monument to victims of state repression under 
josef stalin 
they protested that the group called memorial had not been 
consulted and charged that authorities were trying to limit the 
impact of efforts to raise consciousness about stalinism by 
restricting the competition to moscow 
i think this is an effort after so many victims to shake off 
the historical memory with the help of one or another stone or 
bronze monument railed poet yevgeny yevtushenko 
writer yuri karyakin said he saw an extraordinarily dangerous 
symptom of continued government monopoly over social activity 
despite the reform movement of president mikhail s gorbachev 
yevtushenko karyakin historian yuri afanasyev editor vitaly 
korotich of ogonyok magazine and other figures at the forefront of 
gorbachevs reform effort spoke at a news conference sponsored by 
memorial 
founders of the group lesserknown activists began collecting 
signatures late last year demanding a memorial center to victims of 
stalins repression they were repeatedly arrested and fined until 
they gained official support earlier this year now memorial claims 
more than 100 chapters in other cities 
in july gorbachev spoke out in favor of memorial center which 
is of vital interest in a society still coming to grips with the 
millions of deaths during stalins 19241953 rule thousands of 
soviets have relatives who were killed or sent to labor camps during 
the period 
in late november memorial sponsored an unofficial week of 
conscience in which proposals for a memorial complex were 
displayed 
but the ministry of culture in an announcement published in 
tuesdays issue of the newspaper soviet culture revealed plans for 
a competition to design a monument that excluded memorial 
the list of sponsors included only officially recognized 
organizations such as artistic unions the moscow city government 
and the ministry memorial is an informal organization that has not 
been able to hold a founding conference that conference is 
scheduled for late january 
the competitions rules call for the construction of a single 
monument in moscow but memorial seeks a more comprehensive center 
to educate people about stalins terror through the use of archives 
and other historical materials and local memorial chapters are 
pushing for similar projects in other cities 
the monument will be built in moscow nothing is said about any 
other place yevtushenko said whats actually happening we 
have to think about the whole country all the republics suffered 
the wellknown poet said he had called culture minister vasily 
zakharov to express memorials willingness to work with the ministry 
despite their differences over the project and that he was 
surprised when the details of the project were published tuesday 
soviet culture said the official competition would be divided 
into two parts an initial contest to select the site and the 
general concept and a second stage to select who will work out the 
final details 
on another front memorial has been trying in vain to put forward 
its own candidates for the new congress of peoples deputies a 
national parliamentary body of 2250 people 
authorities have not permitted the group to directly nominate 
candidates because it is not an officially recognized organization 
one of memorials organizers vyacheslav igrunov told reporters 
the campaign for the march 26 elections formally began monday

hoping to repair its frayed 
international relations vietnam has amended its constitution to 
delete condemnation of france japan the united states and china 
the revised preamble was adopted by the countrys national 
assembly last thursday on the closing day of its winter session an 
englishlanguage text carried by the official vietnam news agency 
was monitored today in bangkok 
the constitution hails vietnams victories over the countries it 
has fought since ho chi minh founded the communist party in 1930 
and sets the building of socialism as the key goal it retains the 
frequent mention of the soviet union as the model for vietnams 
revolution 
among the 13 sentences revised in the fourpage preamble the 
names of all four countries cited for criticism have been deleted 
in the third sentence of the preamble for example the phrase 
the japanese french and american imperialists has been changed 
to the aggressors the antifrench resistance has been 
changed to the anticolonial resistance and the the war of 
resistance to us aggression to the war against aggression 
the most extensive deletion was of language condemning china the 
giant northern neighbor with whom vietnam the past couple years has 
made the most concerted efforts to reach rapprochement 
the 1980 preamble said 
no sooner had they emerged from 30 years of liberation war than 
our people who were longing for peace to build their homeland were 
confronted with the chinese hegemonist aggressors and their henchmen 
in kampuchea cambodia 
promoting our glorious national traditions our army and people 
won resounding victories in both wars for national defense against 
the aggression by kampuchean reactionaries on the southwestern 
border and the chinese hegemonists on the northern border 
safeguarding our independence sovereignty unity and territorial 
integrity 
the new preamble says 
after 30 years of liberation war our people are longing for 
peace to build their homeland at the same time constantly promoting 
the glorious traditions of the nation and continuing their staunch 
struggle to firmly defend their independence national sovereignty 
reunification and territorial integrity 
vietnams communist party has been in constant war against the 
french colonial rulers the japanese occupiers during world war ii 
then the americans who backed south vietnam until its defeat in 
april 1975 
once close ties with china ended with a bloody 1979 border war 
and vietnam has become an international pariah state since its 
forces invaded cambodia on christmas day 1978 
since coming to power in december 1986 pragmatists led by 
communist party general secretary nguyen van linh have concentrated 
on economic development pursued negotiations on the cambodian 
issue and declared vietnams desire to become an accepted member of 
the international community

the interior department is moving to clear up 
claims to development rights on federal parklands and insisting 
there will no mining or other private development on protected lands 
the department proposed rules published in tuesdays federal 
register that would allow the laws of individual states to 
determine who has the right to mine coal from national parks 
wildlife refuges wilderness areas and other protected federal 
lands the new york times reported today 
the times said some 4 million acres of federal parkland would be 
potentially open to coal mining 
but the department also published a policy statement saying that 
private work such as coal mining will not be allowed on the lands 
despite the claims according to andre bogolubov director of public 
relations for the interior department 
there will be no timber harvesting development or mining in 
national parks in statutorily protected areas bogolubov said in 
a telephone interview early today with the associated press 
congress prohibited coal mining on parklands and other protected 
federal holdings in 1977 but made an exception for holders of mining 
claims that were valid at the time 
interior secretary donald p hodel has repeatedly said he would 
not allow mining in national parks 
bogolubov said the government would compensate those who have 
valid rights either with land elsewhere or by purchasing the rights 
a lot of people claim to have such a right to develop 
property he said but the definition of valid existing rights 
is vague what this proposed rule does is defines it by making it 
clear who makes the decision and suggests criteria for making the 
determination 
environmentalists say buying back the mining claims could cost 
millions of dollars and they criticized the proposals as a giveaway 
to the coal industry the times reported 
national park service spokesman george berklacy told the ap late 
tuesday there is no reason to be concerned about mining in the 
federal parks 
the worstcase scenario would be that when an individuals 
claim was authenticated as a valid existing right the federal 
government would move to compensate them berklacy said 
bogolubov said federal lands will not be mined this will 
determine if claimants have valid and existing rights then we 
will move to make sure those rights will not be exercised 
national park service officials said only a few parks including 
the new river gorge in west virginia were seriously threatened by 
private mining claims 
a statement by the interior department said the proposals were 
intended to resolve conflicts involving mining claims on federal 
lands and to ensure that private property rights are recognized 
the newspaper said 
how holders of private property rights are defined has been a 
matter of dispute which the new rules attempt to resolve by giving 
states the authority to decide whether the mining claims are valid 
according to the times 
bogolubov said the rules have a 70day comment period before 
taking effect

the census bureau in an experimental study 
says the nations poverty rate in 1986 would have been significantly 
lower than officially reported if the government had used a broader 
definition of personal income 
the study assessed poverty rates under a variety of hypothetical 
definitions and found the reported 1986 poverty rate of 136 percent 
would have been 2 percentage points lower using a definition that 
excluded income taxes and payroll taxes but included noncash 
government benefits not factored into the current standard 
the study also concluded that without social security nearly 
half of the elderly would fall below the poverty line for 1986 the 
poverty line was 5701 for a single person 5255 for a single 
elderly person and 11203 for a family of four 
the study was the first of a series of experimental reports 
compiling benefit and tax data that previously had been handled in 
separate reports 
it also was the first time the census bureau had estimated 
monetary values to recipients of noncash benefits such as medicare 
and medicaid 
the governments current definition of income includes all cash 
pretax income except capital gains including government benefits 
such as social security veterans benefits unemployment and 
workers compensation insurance and public assistance 
some liberal groups have protested the use of pretax income for 
determining the poverty level saying it failed to take into account 
what the individuals had left over after paying taxes 
conservatives on the other hand argued that noncash benefits 
such as medicare medicaid food stamps schoollunch and rent 
subsidies should be included as income when determining the 
poverty level because these programs enhance the quality of the 
recipients lives 
using the current definition the overall national poverty rate 
in 1986 was 136 percent among whites it was 11 percent among 
blacks 311 percent and among hispanics 273 percent 
if the definition were amended to include noncash benefits and 
capital gains the overall poverty rate in 1986 would have been 116 
percent the census bureau reported among whites it would have been 
94 percent among blacks 258 percent and among hispanics 235 
percent 
the new study listed hypothetical poverty rates under a variety 
of possible income definitions including one used in the private 
sector income excluding cashpaid government benefits such as 
social security while adding employerprovided health benefits 
comparing the poverty rate among the elderly using the current 
government standard and the privatesector formula shows the 
striking effect of social security 
using the government formula 124 percent of those over 65 years 
old lived in poverty in 1986 under the privatesector definition 
that excludes social security the poverty rate for that age group 
was 485 percent 
in addition to assessing the effect of various government 
programs and definitions of income on poverty the study listed an 
index of income concentration under each experimental definition 
under the official definition of income the census bureau 
reported that aggregate household income in 1986 was 275 trillion 
with a median household income of 24897 the index of income 
concentration showed that the bottom 20 percent of households 
received 38 percent of total income while the top 20 percent 
received 461 percent 
if all government benefits were subtracted from the income 
definition and employerpaid health benefits were included 524 
percent of all income was received by the top 20 percent of 
households and just 1 percent by the bottom 20 percent 
the effect of taxes on poverty varied depending on the type of 
household the study said 
among marriedcouple families for example subtracting taxes 
from the current income definition increased the poverty rate from 
94 percent to 106 percent among whites from 158 percent to 185 
percent among blacks and from 238 percent to 266 percent among 
hispanics 
in singleparent femaleheaded households subtracting taxes 
increased the poverty rate among whites from 474 percent to 499 
percent for blacks it increased from 647 percent to 679 percent 
and for hispanics the rate increased from 65 percent to 685 
percent 
income definitions that included all government benefits on the 
other hand produced sizeable reductions in the poverty rates 
although some groups still were characterized by high rates 
for example the poverty rate in singleparent femaleheaded 
households dropped from 499 percent to 342 percent among whites 
when government benefits were counted in the income definition 
among such households headed by blacks the rate dropped from 679 
percent to 497 percent by hispanics from 685 percent to 477 
percent

president roh taewoo ordered a 
crackdown on political and labor unrest today and warned that 
violent protests are threatening south koreas political and 
economic stability 
in an unusually tough statement roh issued a special 
directive to police and security forces to halt violent protests 
and labor strikes attacks on government buildings and other 
political violence 
unlawful and disorderly developments and excessive demands 
gushing forth in the course of liquidating authoritarianism are 
threatening not only democracy but also the stability of the free 
economy he told a meeting of key government officials 
opposition and dissident groups immediately denounced rohs 
statement and accused the government of seeking excuses to oppress 
opponents and avoid any loss of authority the national assembly is 
controlled by the opposition 
top opposition leader kim daejung called rohs directive a 
plot schemed by fascists not to lose their invested rights 
government leaders are concerned protests could increase 
opposition to roh because of public anger over revelations of 
corruption and human rights abuses under his predecessor former 
president chun doohwan 
roh is resisting widespread demands that chun be punished 
radical students and dissidents have staged a series of violent 
protests in recent months to demand the overthrow of the roh 
government radicals have also staged scattered attacks on 
government and us military facilities 
the protests have been small compared to major antigovernment 
protests in 1987 but officials have expressed concern at the 
increasing use of violence 
roh said today that radicals use of firebombs and homemade 
explosives in protests had reached a serious phase no deaths 
and just a few serious injuries have been reported in recent 
protests 
the president also expressed concern about frequent violent 
strikes and warned that labor unrest threatens economic stability 
he said the government supports peaceful and legal trade union 
activity but warned that violence and excessive union demands would 
not be tolerated 
roh said the transition to democracy has made great progress and 
violent extremists would not be allowed to pose a threat to national 
stability or the desire of the great majority of koreans for orderly 
change 
law and order will be thoroughly established he said 
commenting on the speech kim accused government hardliners of 
attempting to create a false sense of crisis to frighten people into 
supporting roh and justifying restraints on government opponents 
roh is under political pressure because he is a former ally of 
chun and some koreans identified him with his predecessor 
he has promised to hold a referendum on his rule sometime next 
year and government leaders fear the controversy surrounding chun 
could damage rohs chances of winning and threaten his hold on power 
the president reportedly is also under pressure from government 
hardliners unhappy about political protests and growth of opposition 
and leftwing groups 
chun a former general who took power with military backing in 
1980 went into rural exile last month after apologizing for abuses 
under his rule 
roh also a former general won presidential elections one year 
ago and has dismantled most of the authoritarian controls enacted by 
chun

to stem a rash of aborigine deaths in 
police custody a government report today urged that drunkenness be 
abolished as an offense and racist police officers be replaced by 
aboriginal recruits 
the preliminary report calls for widespread changes in 
australias legal police prison and medical systems to tackle the 
problem and warns that a failure to institute such changes would 
damage australias reputation abroad 
it was issued by james muirhead a lawyer who prime minister bob 
hawke appointed last year as head of a royal commission formed to 
investigate the deaths of 44 aborigines in police custody since 1980 
the commission was to have concluded its probe this week but the 
number of aborigine deaths in police custody has more than doubled 
to 100 since it began work most aborigines have died in police 
cells by hanging after being picked up on charges of being drunk and 
disorderly 
aboriginal activists charge police brutality 
muirhead said the increase in his workload means the final report 
will be delayed by two years in the meantime he issued 56 
recommendations to prevent more aborigines from dying in custody 
in the report muirhead also criticizes attempts that have been 
made to hamper his investigation 
it will be unfortunate if the work of this commission is 
impeded by narrow selfish or political considerations he says 
our performance is being assessed not only in this country but in 
overseas forums and i fear that our countrys reputation will suffer 
if expediency rather than honesty prevails 
australia must know the truth behind the deaths or else we must 
forever live with the knowledge that our fear of the truth or our 
misguided sense of priorities caused us to abandon an essential and 
momentous decision to examine a little of our national character and 
the behavior of people in authority in western australia the 
state where there the most deaths have occurred police and prison 
officers unions backed by the state government have launched a 
federal court challenge to some of the commissions powers 
a royal commission has wider powers than any judicial body in the 
country but is not empowered to pass legal judgment its findings 
however can result in legal action at the state and federal level 
aborigines the countrys original inhabitants number about 
160000 or 1 percent of australias 16 million people 
the inquiry comes at a particularly sensitive time with ongoing 
bicentennial celebrations marking european settlement aboriginal 
activitists have declared 1988 a year of mourning 
muirhead says in his report that governments at the state and 
federal level should legislate to ensure that jail is used only as a 
last resort for drunkenness 
justice minister michael tate said the federal government 
generally agrees with the thrust of the report 
muirhead refused comment beyond his recommendations which 
included 
that drunkenness be abolished as an offense accompanied by 
programs to treat alcohol abuse and changes to the law to force 
police to consider alternatives to jail for drunk people that a 
national task force be set up to examine social and health problems 
among aborigines caused by alcohol abuse 
that people found unconscious by police should be taken to a 
hospital or a qualified health worker and not to jail he encouraged 
the recruitment of aboriginal police and prison officers and 
screening to prevent racist police and prison officers from being 
retained 
federal statistics show that aboriginal life expectancy is 20 
years less than for other australians while infant mortality among 
aborigines is almost three times higher than among nonaborigines 
aborigines according to government figures also have a far 
higher rate of diseases like trachoma while imprisonment rates for 
aborigines are 16 times higher than the national average 
aboriginal unemployment is some six times the national average 
there are virtually no aborigines in professions such as law 
education and medicine despite millions of dollars each year in 
federal funds for aborigines

a new rightwing death squad is 
promising bloody retribution for any killings car bombings and 
death threats by leftist guerrillas in el salvador according to a 
communique 
the only way to achieve the total extermination of this horde 
of terrorist killers is by the same means and with the same force 
they use says the communique issued by a group calling itself the 
revolutionary anticommunist exterminating action or arde 
the group threatened to kill two leftist leaders for each person 
the guerrillas kidnap or kill to bomb the house of one leftist 
leader for every car bomb and to kill one leftist for each mayor 
forced to resign under death threats from leftist guerrillas 
the communique was delivered to media outlets last weekend and 
several radio stations began broadcasting it tuesday 
in the early 1980s death squads regularly issued communiques 
threatening individuals or leftist groups and those threats were 
frequently carried out the last such communique was issued in june 
1987 
the farabundo marti national liberation front a coalition of 
five leftist guerrilla groups that have been fighting the government 
since 1979 has set off several car bombs in san salvador in recent 
months 
on friday guerrillas attacked the defense ministry headquarters 
compound on the edge of the capital with four car bombs and 
explosives killing four people and wounding 35 
the same day unidentified terrorists attacked the national 
university which rightists have often accused of being a center of 
leftist activity a night watchman was killed and the biology lab 
building was blown up 
death threats from guerrillas have forced 18 mayors from small 
provincial towns to resign during the past three months 
the arde communique dated dec 21 was delivered by hand to five 
newspapers four television stations and six radio stations it said 
the media would be attacked drastically if they did not publish 
the communique for three consecutive days 
the communique contains a list of leftist leaders headed by top 
liberation front commanders shafick handal and ferman cienfuegos 
who it said would be killed in reprisals 
it also listed among possible victims guillermo ungo a leftist 
candidate in presidential elections next march and ruben zamora 
his campaign coordinator both belong to the democratic 
revolutionary front a nonfighting coalition of leftist parties 
movements and student and labor unions closely allied with the 
liberation front 
zamora who returned to el salvador in november 1987 after seven 
years of exile said in a telephone interview that the threats 
show that ultrarightist sectors are desperate because we are on 
the right electoral path and we will not retreat in the face of 
threats and blackmail 
an estimated 65500 people have been killed since guerrillas 
launched a civil war in 1979 against a succession of ussupported 
governments human rights groups say most of the victims have been 
civilians slain by left or rightwing death squads 
rightwing death squads organized or tolerated by the military 
were blamed for thousands of slayings from 1980 to early 1984 
the slayings abated in july 1984 when president jose napoleon 
duartes centrist christian democratic administration took office 
after the first free elections in el salvador and forced the 
military to sever all ties with the rightist squads

south korea sent a message to communist 
north korea today agreeing to highlevel political and military 
talks aimed at reducing tension on the divided peninsula 
prime minister kang younghoon suggested in the letter to north 
korean counterpart yon hyung muk that they head delegations to 
alternating talks in seoul and pyongyang to discuss 
noninterference cooperation in select areas and building mutual 
trust in military matters 
to wipe out mutual distrust and restore trust between them the 
two koreas should recognize each others ideologies and systems 
conduct dialogue on the basis of mutual respect and noninterference 
and develop cooperative relations on the principle of mutuality 
until unification is achieved kang wrote in the letter delivered 
to the north at the border truce site of panmunjom 
but the souths response to a nov 16 north korean proposal for 
wide ranging talks on reduction of military forces did not appear to 
go as far the south did not refer to troop reduction and its 
proposal was more vague 
kang made no reference to the norths proposal that talks also 
negotiate withdrawal of the us forces based in the south under a 
mutual defense pact the united states has 42000 troops in the 
south 
south koreas letter also proposed separate economic and red 
cross talks to discuss cooperation in humanitarian and economic 
areas it proposed preliminary talks in early february to set the 
terms for full negotiations 
the south also called for prime ministers to head the 
delegations instead of deputy premiers as proposed by the north 
procedural differences have been a major problem in arranging 
northsouth talks in the past 
the rival koreas have both been pressing major iniatives to end 
the long bitter confrontation dividing the peninsula 
although some progress has been made both sides have tended to 
stress their respective iniatives and play down the others 
proposals 
delegations of lawmakers are to resume talks thursday at 
panmunjom on clearing the way for fullscale parliamentary talks on 
a nonaggression pact and other measures south korean legislators 
expect full talks to be held sometime next year 
todays letter was in response to a separate north korean 
proposal for intergovernment talks past talks between the two 
koreas on reducing tension failed to make progress 
south korean officials have expressed some mistrust about the 
norths intentions they say the norths insistence on discussing 
withdrawal of us forces indicates pyongyang may be using talks to 
try and weaken the south 
south korean officials say american forces are needed for the 
foreseeable future to prevent a north korean attack us officials 
have said their forces will remain in the south as long as they are 
wanted by the seoul government 
the two koreas have hundreds of thousands of troops facing each 
other along the 150mile border which is sealed there are no 
communications except for a hot line 
us and soviet forces divided the korean peninsula when they 
ended the japanese occupation at the end of the second world war in 
1945 the north invaded the south in 1950 to start the korean war

logan international airports operators havent 
ended their fight after grudgingly complying with a federal order to 
halt hefty fees that were designed to dissuade small craft from 
landing at the crowded airfield 
the new landing fee system had been watched closely by the 
aviation industry nationwide as a possible precedent for dealing 
with congestion at major airports federal officials rank logan 
among the countrys 10 most congested airports 
last week the us department of transportation ruled the fee 
structure was unreasonable discriminatory and in violation of 
federal law 
deputy transportation secretary mimi weyforth dawson signed an 
order thursday that gave the massachusetts port authority seven days 
to rescind its fee structure or lose eligibility for 102 million 
in federal aviation improvement grants for this fiscal year 
in response port authority officials voted tuesday to 
temporarily suspend the increased landing fees beginning today but 
to file a request with the us court of appeals here seeking a 
review of the matter 
we are simply recognizing that an aircraft carrying hundreds 
and hundreds of people should not have to wait in line while a small 
craft carrying maybe one or two people lands said theresa 
mcalpine a spokeswoman for the state agency 
bob marx a spokesman for the federal agency said it would have 
no comment on the port authority vote 
small aircraft lobbyists said they would continue their vigorous 
opposition to the plan which they said cost them an average of 500 
percent more in fees 
at this point the whole case has been groundbreaking we 
feel that the department of transportations decision is final and 
binding and certainly very clear said patricia weil a spokesman 
for the national aircraft owners and pilots association 
the program for airport capacity efficiency which went into 
effect july 1 was intended to reduce congestion and delays by 
charging fees so high they would discourage users of small craft 
from flying in and out of logan 
under the new fee structure all planes were assessed an 88 flat 
fee and 47 cents per 1000 pounds the old system charged 131 per 
1000 pounds or 25 whichever was greater 
the new fee for a boeing 747 for example dropped to 450 from 
680 while a cessna 402 seating 10 passengers was charged 106 
versus 25 mcalpine said 
organizations representing small aircraft pilots reacted by 
filing complaints in court and with the federal department of 
transportation

an agent who owns the rights to the story 
that became the film rear window was allowed to sue over the 
movies rerelease in a ruling that could give authors heirs new 
bargaining power against studios 
although the original 1954 alfred hitchcock film was made with 
the permission of the storys author cornell woolrich that 
authority didnt extend to the new theater and cable release in the 
early 1980s the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled tuesday 
woolrich had died by the time of the new release and his initial 
copyright period had expired the court noted 
the 21 ruling allows sheldon abend the new york agent who owns 
the copyright to woolrichs story to pursue his damage suit against 
hitchcocks estate 
the court however rejected abends attempt to halt further 
distribution of rear window saying the movies success was 
largely unrelated to the short story 
abends lawyer peter j anderson said the ruling means that 
the surviving spouses and estates of authors are going to get some 
compensation for continued use of the authors literary property 
defense lawyer louis petrich said he planned to appeal his 
clients include actor james stewart who besides starring in the 
film owns part of it 
the ruling is not what you would call proauthor since it is 
absolutely contrary to the interests of the authors of the movie 
the owners and hitchcock and stewart petrich said 
woolrich published the short story it had to be murder in a 
1942 issue of dime detective magazine the rights were later bought 
by paramount pictures for rear window 
anderson said the story contained most of the plot of the movie 
about a wheelchairbound man who gathers evidence of a murder while 
viewing neighbors from his apartment window stewarts love

anderson said 
in selling the film rights for 9250 woolrich promised to renew 
the rights for an additional 28 years the period provided by law 
after his original 28year copyright expired but woolrich died in 
1968 before the first period expired in 1972 abend bought the 
rights to the short story from woolrichs estate for 650 plus 10 
percent of the proceeds 
relying on a 1977 ruling by a new yorkbased federal appeals 
court in another case the owners of rear window released the 
film again for theater and home viewing in the early 1980s 
producing more than 12 million in revenue the court said 
abend then sued claiming copyright violation 
us district judge a andrew hauk of los angeles dismissed the 
suit saying the makers of rear window had properly acquired a 
continuing copyright in the film during woolrichs lifetime 
but the appeals court tuesday disagreed with hauk and with the 
1977 ruling saying abend could be entitled to damages

president reagan and other us officials 
marked the ninth anniversary of soviet intervention in afghanistan 
stressing that they expect moscow to honor its commitment to 
complete military withdrawal by feb 15 
failure to meet the deadline would get moscow off to a very bad 
start with presidentelect bushs incoming administration warned 
michael armacost the state departments undersecretary for 
political affairs 
the state department also predicted tuesday that the afghan 
national army will collapse after the soviet withdrawal is completed 
and that some top leaders of the kabul government regarded by the 
populace as traitors might choose to flee the country 
the soviet union sent troops into afghanistan on dec 27 1979 
western analysts say their were 110000 to 115000 soviet troops in 
the country supporting the government against rebels armed by the 
united states about half have been withdrawn 
i fully expect them to honor their obligation to withdraw 
completely by feb 15 president reagan said in a statement issued 
by the white house during his california vacation 
but the president and other officials also voiced concern that 
the withdrawal has been halted and soviet offensive military 
operations have resumed 
even today as feb 15 approaches the soviets continue 
offensive military operations in afghanistan reagan said the 
introduction of new weapons and the escalation in the use of soviet 
warplanes in bombing raids against afghanistan call into question 
the soviet commitment to a peaceful solution 
in a report released tuesday on the military situation in 
afghanistan the state department said the rebels made sizable gains 
this year despite the introduction of backfire bombers and other new 
weapons by the soviets 
the report called the afghan army demoralized force suffering 
shortages of qualified officers and manpower despite forced 
conscriptions and bribes of tribal militia 
most experts agree that it probably can survive no more than a 
matter of months after a complete soviet withdrawal it said 
the report also hailed talks earlier this year the soviets had 
with resistance leaders without representatives of the kabul 
government moscow now appears ready to explore all options that 
could lead to a political settlement the report said

bolivia his wealth in 1949 was estimated at 200 million 
during his heyday mccarthy lived in a mansion and surrounded 
himself with hollywood celebrities and powerful politicians his 
675carat diamond ring earned him the nickname of diamond glenn 
and he was featured on the cover of time magazine in the 1950s 
in one interview mccarthy said he was dubbed the king of the 
wildcatters by famed world war ii journalist ernie pyle a 
90proof kentucky bourbon bearing the label glenn mccarthys 
wildcatter went on the market in 1965 
his reputation as a bad boy was enhanced by edna ferbers 
bestselling book giant which was based on mccarthy the movie

finnish police said today they closed 
their investigation of telephone bomb threats to the us embassy in 
helsinki after finding no link between the calls and the pan am air 
tragedy in scotland 
security police chief seppo tiitinen was quoted on national radio 
as saying the outcome of a probe by britain police of a possible 
suitcase bomb would in no way change the results of our 
investigations 
although two cases of bomb threats had similar traits to what 
happened in scotland we have found no connection between these 
calls and the dec 21 crash tiitinen said the case was closed 
he added 
british investigators were studying a torn suitcase and pieces of 
wreckage to see whether they reveal traces of a bomb that may have 
caused an explosion killing all 259 people on board and 11 in the 
village of lockerbie 
on tuesday fbi officials were reported as saying no link had 
been found between the bomb threats to the helsinki embassy and the 
crash of flight 103 a new yorkbound boeing 747 
tiitanen said the us embassy was warned on dec 5 that an arab 
residing in finland would plant a bomb aboard an american airliner 
originating from frankfurt west germany within a couple of 
weeks flight 103 via london had originated in frankfurt with a 
boeing 727 
the caller also believed to be an arab had issued similar 
warnings to the israeli and us embassies here earlier this year 
police said 
tiitinen said each call was taken seriously but that the calls 
apparently were prompted by a personal feud between the two arabs 
police had questioned the man the caller accused of preparing the 
bomb on several occasions but refused to disclose his identity 
he is a man who has been living in finland for some time and is 
married to a finnish woman and he has no record of trouble with the 
police tiitinen said earlier

the charred bodies of 44 suspected 
antigovernment militants were found this week in southern sri 
lanka a senior police officer said today 
the victims had been shot to death and then burned with tires in 
southern sri lanka the sinhalese heartland said the officer 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
in a communique the government blamed the murders on a new 
extremist group that has been targeting sinhalese militants 
claiming they are responsible for the escalating ethnic violence on 
this tropical indian ocean island 
at least 19 bodies were found monday and tuesday along roads 
about 110 miles south of colombo the officer said 
the peoples liberation front comprised of militant sinhalese 
opposes the governments efforts to end the 5year insurgency by 
tamil extremists who are demanding a separate homeland in the north 
and east more than 8500 people have died in the fighting 
the tamils are mostly hindu and make up 18 percent of the 
islands population they have long accused the majority sinhalese 
of denying them jobs and education the sinhalese predominantly 
buddhists comprise 75 percent of the population 
the sinhalesedominanted government signed an accord in july 1987 
offering limited autonomy to the tamils 
militant tamils say the accord does not meet enough demands for 
selfrule 
but sinhalese extremists contend the accord grants too many 
concessions and have vowed to kill anyone who supports the 
agreement they have been blamed for more than 900 murders since the 
accord was signed 17 months ago 
most of the victims have been supporters of the governing united 
national party or security personnel 
the group the government blamed for this weeks murders of 
suspected sinhalese militants is the peoples revolutionary red 
army which surfaced about a month ago and began hunting front 
members 
authorities say they believe the red army is comprised of members 
of paramilitary units a leftist political organization and a tamil 
rebel group

airlines will soon be asked to replace rivets in 
more than 800 boeing 727s that were made with what is now considered 
an outmoded bonding process a federal aviation administration 
official said 
darrell pederson a local faa assistant manager said tuesday the 
agency was very close to issuing a notice of proposed 
rulemaking which can be followed by an airworthiness directive 
after some time for public comment 
a similar directive was issued after a 20foot section tore loose 
from an aloha airlines 737 jet in midflight in april sending a 
flight attendant to her death pederson said 
under that directive airlines had to replace more than 7000 
rivets on at least 100 older boeing 737s at a cost of about 8 
million in addition altitude and other restrictions were imposed 
pending inspection for cracks 
intense inspection also is part of the proposed 727 directives 
which had been under consideration for an unspecified time before a 
22yearold eastern airlines 727 made an emergency landing monday in 
charleston wva after a sudden rupture caused a 14inch hole in 
the fuselage pederson said 
boeing is based in seattle 
we will take another look at what he had planned on doing in 
view of this situation he said if the proposed directive 
covers it adequately then we will proceed with that one if theres 
something new here not covered then we will have to take some other 
action 
he said the directive would cover 831 of the trijets airplanes 
having three jet engines that were assembled by coldbonding 
making them more susceptible to cracks than the heated adhesives to 
join pieces of the fuselage a technique boeing adopted in 1971 
the jet involved monday was the 242nd of 1831 boeing 727s that 
were produced between 1964 and 1984 when te line was discontinued 
craig martin of boeing and ted lopatkiewicz of the national 
transportation safety board said the cause of the rupture remained 
under investigation it occurred in the outer skin of the plane on 
top of the fuselage near the tail in a section martin said was 
replaced sometime after the plane was delivered to eastern in 1966 
we dont know if it was a fatigue problem or skin damage from 
some other cause martin said

israeli soldiers killed three palestinian 
guerrillas early today in a gunfight in southern lebanon near an 
israeli border community a military spokesman said 
no israeli troops were hurt in the clash the spokesman said on 
condition of anonymity 
the clash began at about 3 am in the israelicontrolled 
security zone near the village of meiss eljabal it was near 
the site where paratroopers killed three other guerrillas this week 
in sidon lebanon the palestinian liberation front said three of 
its guerrillas crossed the border into northern israel today and 
clashed with israeli troops for six hours it said the fate of the 
attackers was unknown 
the front whose leader taalat yacoub died of a heart attack 
last month is a small radical faction of yasser arafats palestine 
liberation organization 
maj gen yossi peled head of israels northern command said 
the guerrillas were trying to cross the border to launch an attack 
on kibbutz manara a collective farm community 100 yards from the 
site of the clash 
when they get within meters of a settlement it is easy to 
figure out what their goal was their goal was the settlement 
peled said on israel radio 
the fronts statement said the attack was dedicated as a 
memorial for yacoub a champion of armed struggle to liberate 
palestine yacoub had his political headquarters in syria and a 
military base at the ein elhilweh refugee camp near sidon in 
southern lebanon 
the statement did not specify what the guerrillas target was 
only that they clashed with israeli forces 
it was the third infiltration attempt this week and the third 
since the united states agreed to a dialogue with the plo on dec 
14 after arafat announced he was renouncing terrorism 
on monday israeli paratroopers killed three guerrillas near 
meiss el jabal three other guerrillas drowned in a rubber dinghy 
off the coast of lebanon the same day as they tried to make their 
way to israel the army said 
a paratrooper identified only as capt yair told israel 
radio the guerrillas killed today apparently were trying to use the 
cover of stormy weather rain and fog to infiltrate israel 
they come in any weather this kind of weather makes it harder 
for us and they assume they can take advantage of it he said 
now the problem is when the next attempt will come 
troops found machine guns and ammunition with the guerrillas and 
wire cutters they apparently planned to use to cut the border fence 
the army spokesman said 
israel carved out its security zone a sixto10mile wide buffer 
strip in southern lebanon in 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its 
troops from lebaon it is jointly patrolled by israeli soldiers and 
the south lebanon army an israelibacked militia 
the palestine national council the plos parliamentinexile 
last month endorsed a 1985 declaration by the plo that it would 
restrict its attacks to military targets inside israel and the 
occupied territories 
the front along with other factions in the plo approved that 
but it has made no comment on arafats later declaration renouncing 
terrorism 
the united states has said it will break off the talks with the 
plo if the movement is found to be implicated in terrorist attacks 
several dissident syrianbacked palestinian factions who are not 
members of the plo have denounced arafats declaration as a 
betrayal of the palestinian cause and vowed to continue the armed 
struggle against israel

jerusalem and the police spokesmans office said three palestinians 
were detained 
in gaza the army clamped a curfew on four refugee camps 
confining 150000 arabs to their homes 
in the west bank city of nablus 18yearold samir shehadah was 
shot to death during a clash with troops arab reports said

town of tulkarem arab hospital officials said a 13yearold boy 
was shot and wounded in a stonethrowing clash in the bureij refugee 
camp near gaza city hospital officials and reporters said 
the army said it was investigating the reports 
shehadah was the second palestinian killed in as many days and

villager mohammed omar ahmed khalil died of gunshot wounds received 
tuesday 
the army said it learned of the death through hospital reports 
but was having trouble determining the circumstances because 
relatives took khalils body from the hospital 
the army customarily takes the bodies of palestinians killed in 
the uprising to perform an autopsy and usually orders the family to 
conduct a quiet burial to avoid nationalist protests palestinians 
oppose the practice and try to bring a shahid martyr to an 
immediate burial

jan 12 all documents pertaining to silme domingo and gene viernes 
who were gunned down in the seattle offices of the alaska cannery 
workers union where they were officials

and viernes the suit alleges the murders were committed by agents 
of marcos in order to stop antimarcos activities by viernes and 
domingo 
marcos and his wife imelda are among defendants named in the 
suit they were dismissed as defendants in the case in 1982 but 
reinstated by rothstein in 1987

battery in connection with the deaths 
the federal agencies ordered to provide documents are the 
department of justice the state department the fbi the national 
security council the cia the defense intelligence agency the 
naval intelligence service and the naval investigative servicenaval

more than 2000 chinese youths some 
yelling blood for blood gathered in central nanking today in 
the fourth straight day of antiblack demonstrations 
hundreds of helmeted riot police carrying truncheons hit 
demonstrators and shoved others into police vans as the youths 
surged onto the street of the circular intersection adjacent to the 
gulou drum tower monument 
meanwhile the last american to remain with african students 
forced into hiding by the angry mobs said the africans are 
determined not to return to their schools in the eastern china city 
absolutely no one wants to go back heather mcmillen of 
portland ore said of the 140 black african students who have been 
held incommunicado in a suburban nanking hotel since monday 
the chinese youths in a repeat of a tuesday night rally began 
gathering about 630 pm they shouted slogans such as blood for 
blood and support the law but did not cast racial aspersions 
on blacks as was done in demonstrations sunday and monday 
in the earlier dermonstrations the chinese youths carried 
banners and chanted such sayings as kill the black devils and 
black devils go home 
we want our government to support the law we want the black 
students to face the law in china one 18yearold male student 
from nanking university told the associated press 
a police loudspeaker at the intersection ordered the young people 
to leave the area saying their activities were destroying peace 
and affecting the unity of the people 
the students have defied warnings from nanking authorities that 
all unauthorized demonstrations are illegal 
students said some of their companions were also taken away in 
police vans tuesday night but most were released hours later 
gates at several of nankings main universities were locked and 
guarded by police in an apparent attempt to keep students off the 
street 
chinese officials say there have been no arrests of either 
africans or chinese since the trouble began saturday 
chinas worst outbreak of racial violence in years was triggered 
by a christmas eve fight between chinese guards at hehai university 
and african students who refused to register their chinese 
girlfriends they were taking to a party on the campus 
thousands of chinese students learning that 11 chinese had been 
injured in the brawl smashed windows at the africans dormitory and 
marched on other universities demanding that african students be 
punished 
miss mcmillen said she and one japanese woman returned to nanking 
late today a day after five other americans who accompanied the 
besieged africans returned to their schools about 20 nonafricans 
including students from asia and europe remain with the group 
the africans who fled to the railway station sunday in an 
attempt to board trains from beijing on monday were forced by 
police to board buses for the hotel about two hours outside the city 
miss mcmillen who was helping serve food and water to the 
africans at the railway station when she too was pulled onto a bus 
said the students were unable to contact their embassies or make 
outside calls from the hotel 
she said 10 african diplomats from beijing met the students 
tuesday night no decisions were made at the meeting she said but 
the diplomats were sympathetic with the students desire to leave 
the city and said they would help them reach their embassies in 
beijing 
miss mcmillen citing incidents related to her by other foreign 
students said the antiblack demonstrations have also at times 
taken on a more general antiforeign tinge 
several european women students she said had rocks thrown at 
them and a white american at nanjing university said chinese youth 
had shouted go home at him i dont feel comfortable walking 
outside said miss mcmillen a tourist who has been visiting 
friends in nanking 
in the past 10 years the chinese government has pushed an 
opendoor policy of encouraging the infusion of western technology 
and learning but closer contacts with foreigners whose living 
conditions are usually far better than those of chinese has bred 
resentment

the photo showed bush dressed in a teal shirt red sweater cap 
and camouflage coveralls he carried his shotgun 
bushs cap bore the insignia of b or m kennels which provided 
the dogs to flush out the quail aides said 
steve hart bushs spokesman said the vice president was 
successful but he did not know how many birds bush had killed 
he didnt strike out hart said 
conditions have been less than perfect for quail hunting this 
year local residents say in part because of the drought which 
killed some birds tuesdays temperatures in the 70s were above the 
ideal level for quail hunting and gusty winds were an impediment 
bush is scheduled to remain on the lazy f today with his friends 
will farish the houston millionaire who owns the ranch and james 
a baker iii the designated secretary of state 
bush is to leave thursday morning flying first to alabama for a 
few hours of fishing before he returns to the nations capital

cadets graduating from a state police 
training academy were told today that they would be accepted among 
their colleagues despite the controversy surrounding the troubled 
facility 
last fall the death of one recruit and the hospitilization of 
more than a dozen others during strict training caused an uproar and 
led to an overhaul of the agency that trains police 
peter w agnes jr interim director of that agency the criminal 
justice training council assured the recruits that they had not 
somehow missed out on something that other police officers had in 
their training 
the 45 cadets receiving diplomas at the graduation ceremony at 
agawam junior high school were five fewer than the 50 municipal 
rookies who entered the police academy in agawam on sept 19 
within a week 13 cadets had been hospitalized from dehydration 
and exhaustion and one cadet timothy shepard of pittsfield had 
fallen unconscious from heat stroke shepard 25 eventually 
regained consciousness and underwent a liver transplant but 
succumbed to infections and died nov 3 
your experience as members of the 12th recruit class has done 
more to change the methods and approach to police training in this 
state than any other event since the establishment of the municipal 
training council in 1964 agnes said in graduation remarks 
you are special because of what you have endured and you are 
special because of what you and tim shepard have inspired us to do 
for those who will come after you he said 
the cadets hospitalization sparked investigations by two 
legislative groups and a panel of police chiefs doctors and 
exercise experts assembled by gov michael s dukakis the 
governors report is expected within a month 
shepards death also prompted an inquest to determine whether 
criminal negligence charges should be brought the inquest is in 
recess in springfield district court 
shepards family has said they want charges filed against the 
cadets trainers who led six other troopers in directing allegedly 
grueling training on the first day of the 14week session 
agnes replaced executive director gary egan as head of the 
training council when egan resigned hours before shepard died

the following is the text of the statement released 
wednesday by the air accidents investigation branch of the 
department of transport on the dec 21 crash of pan am flight 103 
a number of items of wreckage passenger baggage and part of the 
framework of a metal luggage pallet are being examined by ministry 
of defense scientists more items have been collected by air 
accidents investigation branch investigators from the accident area 
each of these will be subjected to lengthy chemical and 
metallurgical forensic examinations 
however it has been established that two parts of the metal 
luggage pallet framework show conclusive evidence of a detonating 
high explosive 
the explosives residues recovered from the debris have been 
positively identified and are consistent with the use of a high 
performance plastic explosive 
other evidence collected by the air accidents investigation 
branch in particular that from the flight data recorder and the 
cockpit voice recorder and from the wreckage trail on the ground 
has led to the preliminary conclusion that the explosion took place 
soon after the aircraft had crossed the scottish border whilst it 
was in the cruise at 31000 feet and that this led directly to its 
destruction 
much investigative work remains to be done to establish the 
nature of the explosive device what it was contained in its 
location in the aircraft and the sequence of events immediately 
following its detonation

the federal trade commission said today it has 
charged budget rentacar corp with failing to disclose to 
prospective renters that it failed to inspect automobiles subject to 
recall notices within a reasonable period of time and make the 
necessary repairs 
the agency at the same time said it had reached a consent 
agreement with budget which agreed to make the inspections and 
repairs on a timely basis 
jody wilson a spokeswoman at budgets corporate headquarters in 
chicago said the company had no immediate comment on the ftc 
announcement 
according to the governments complaint budget rented to the 
general public automobiles that were subject to recall notices 
the company allegedly did not inspect these vehicles within a 
reasonable period of time after the recall notice to determine 
whether they contained safetyrelated defects and where 
appropriate repair the vehicles budget then failed to disclose 
these facts to prospective renters or purchasers of the vehicles 
the ftc said 
under the consent agreement budget will inspect and repair the 
vehicles within 120 days after receiving a recall notice 
alternatively if budget chooses not to inspect the order would 
require budget to disclose to prospective renters that the vehicles 
are subject to safety recall notices and may contain defects 
the proposed consent agreement scheduled to appear in the 
federal register on jan 3 will be subject to public comment for 60 
days after which the ftc will decide whether to make it final 
a consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not 
constitute admission of a law violation 
when the ftc issues a consent order on a final basis it carries 
the force of law with respect to future actions each violation of 
such an order may result in a civil penalty of up to 10000

the daily times primos pa on the pan am crash 
there is sorrow anger and shock across the united states this 
holiday season 
sorrow because scores of american servicemen government 
officials students and tourists were among the 258 people killed in 
the crash of pan am flight 103 in lockerbie scotland 
anger because the us embassy in finland received an anonymous 
tip earlier this month that the abu nidal terrorist group would 
target a pan am flight to the us 
and shock because the us government warned the airline and some 
of its own personnel without telling the public 
that outrage should be channeled in the proper direction if 
flight 103 was blown out of the sky by terrorists they and they 
alone are the ones at whom we should direct our anger and our

west bend wis daily news on the congressional pay raise 
we agree with senelect herbert kohl that while members of 
congress may deserve a pay hike the 50 percent raise recommended by 
a presidential commission is out of line 
and we urge other members of wisconsins congressional delegation 
to follow kohls lead and reject the increase in annual pay from 
89500 to 135000 even if it is approved 
there arent many people working in the private sector here in 
west bend who will receive 50 percent pay increases in 1989 and if 
they do its a safe bet their performance has been monitored by a 
more scientific yardstick than the elections congressmen and 
senators are subjected to each two and six years respectively 
it is true that in order to attract the qualified people we need 
in washington dc the pay must be competitive with the private 
sector and also must take into consideration the high cost of living 
in the nations capital but its hard for most americans to feel 
sorry for someone already earning 89500 a year 
this proposal concerns us here in west bend just as all other 
local state and federal government spending concerns us the only 
way to turn deficit spending around is to adopt a more judicious 
approach to the way tax dollars are allocated

the philadelphia inquirer on the earthquake in armenia 
one of the most haunting elements of the armenian earthquake is 
how it perpetuates a history of suffering that is centuries old 
once an empire armenia had undergone a centurieslong series of 
conquerors when it reached its nadir in the years following 1915 
one and a half million armenians were killed or forced to flee under 
murderous conditions at the hands of the ottoman turks 
it is the deeprooted fears and insecurities provoked by those 
memories that has made armenian nationalism one of the most 
explosive of the ethnic problems that plague mr gorbachev 
having experienced a staggering new blow the earthquake that 
has united the worlds armenians armenians of the soviet union 
are unlikely to drop their territorial cause mr gorbachev will 
have to sensitize himself to the depth of these emotions if he 
wants to prevent a political earthquake from shaking armenia

the news and observer raleigh nc on state lotteries 
virginias new state lottery has put the little town of bracey on 
the map theres a truck stop there off interstate 85 just over 
the line from north carolina that led all virginia lottery outlets 
with 387500 in tickets sold in one recent game sales in other 
communities near the state line were equally impressive much of the 
money presumably came from north carolinians who crossed the 
border in search of a windfall but thats no reason to yield to the 
temptation to start up a tar heel lottery 
any windfall for north carolina would be illusory states 
typically find that lotteries instead of providing extra revenues 
eventually shift a revenue burden onto people who can ill afford it 
thats because lotteries can become a substitute for more equitable 
taxes and because they tend to appeal to people who have the least 
to start with its easy for those people to forget that most 
lottery players are losers not winners 
as is usually true when a scheme promises something for nothing 
the reality is more like nothing for something in the case of a 
lottery its likely to be nothing in the way of dependable 
revenue in exchange for the something of promoting 
statesanctioned gambling and extracting money from the poor

the miami news on the us political asylum policy 
the asylum policy and review unit apru is a justice department 
agency established to monitor decisions made by the immigration and 
naturalization service another justice department agency but one 
which behaves as if it were the only law west of the beltway 
ins commissioner alan nelson wants his word to be law and in 
asking attorney general richard thornburgh to expunge the apru has 
made the standard reaganesque argument running the unit is too 
expensive nelson says he figures that in the year since apru has 
been in operation it has cost 750000 
thats a lot of money but by government standards not enough to 
hang an argument on and nelsons real objective protecting his 
authority is transparent enough to wrap a sandwich 
the apru has been more lenient than the firstlevel ins examiners 
in favoring asylum requests and supporting further reviews given 
the arbitrary nature of asylum policy and its application attorney 
general thornburgh would be wise to treat nelsons territorial 
complaint as what it is and continue to encourage the asylum review 
unit and the asylum review process

presidentelect george bush offered up a mixed bag in his 
selections last week for cabinet posts 
elizabeth doles appointment as labor secretary is an excellent 
one she was a strong transportation secretary in the reagan 
administration 
bush chose well in naming dr louis w sullivan as secretary of 
health and human services 
another outstanding appointment is that of william kane reilly 
president of the conservation foundation and the world wildlife 
fund as head of the environmental protection agency which is not a 
cabinetlevel job 
former congressman from chicago edward joseph derwinski who 
helped negotiate the ross dam treaty when he served in the state 
department is a good choice for the veterans post 
samuel knox skinner the nominee for transportation secretary and 
a former federal prosecutor in chicago received high marks as 
chairman of the regional transportation authority of northeastern 
illinois 
the most worrisome appointment is that of retiring rep manuel 
lujan jr as secretary of interior lujan has been a supporter of 
the infamous james watt who brough disgrace to the agency when he 
headed it westerners striving for reasonable policies to conserve 
precious resources can only hope lujan is capable of growing wiser

the daily journal elizabeth nj on a survey calling for 
parents to supplement the teaching of their children 
in a carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching 
survey 90 percent of teachers said lack of parental support was a 
problem in their schools 
realistically little is likely to change unless teachers 
themselves press for new and creative efforts on the part of the 
schools to encourage or even require greater parent 
participation in the education process 
by law parents must provide an approved education for their 
children for most parents this means sending them to public 
school busy trying to make tasks that have been loaded on the 
schools the parents end their involvement there 
simply increasing parental awareness of how teachers feel may 
help but we cannot realistically expect teaches to receive more 
parental support until school programs include parents in practical 
and meaningful ways that are related to the education of their own 
children

anderson sc independentmail on congressional pay raise 
we wish that members of the congress of the united states would 
forego at least for this term a hefty raise for themselves 
we have two reasons for suggesting that congressmen reject the 
proposal of a presidential commission that they boost their salaries 
by 50 percent from 89500 to 135000 annually both involve the 
treacherous state of governmental economic affairs the horrible 
national debt that hangs over every citizen of the united states 
it would be at least a symbolic gesture of responsibility if the 
congress would say no to the increase proclaiming by action rather 
than words for once that it is seeking to save every dollar possible 
in a quest to get the debt under control 
secondly we dont think their performance deserves a merit 
increase they have had a lot of fun overspending other peoples 
money and getting reelected as a result but its time the 
merrygoround stopped 
we realize the raise must occur early in the upcoming session or 
the electorate is going to have the increase on their minds when the 
next election rolls around that would be political folly 
but rather than react in the traditional political manner it 
would be nice if our representatives and senators responded in a 
responsible way

the arizona daily star tucson ariz on steroids and athletes 
anabolic steroids are most often associated with toplevel 
athletes driven to physical perfection sometimes however the 
drugs entrap young boys seeking a quick way to improve athletic 
prowess or to impress their friends with a muscular physique 
schools and parents must begin to deal with this potentially abusive 
behavior 
up to 500000 highschool boys have taken anabolic steroids to 
boost their athletic performance or improve their looks according 
to pennslyvania state university which conducted the first 
nationwide study on the topic 
perhaps adolescent anabolic steroid use is a result of modern 
american societys obsession with winning and looking good if so 
the message is sobering teenage boys are ingesting potentially 
dangerous drugs to keep up with the impossible physical ideals 
constantly thrown at them 
one of the most disturbing aspects of this behavior is that so 
little is known about how the drugs will affect adolescents 
developing bodies this quick fix could well come back to haunt 
adolescents health later on

million in fines and assessments it was the second major guilty 
plea in an insider trading investigation that has grown into the

over time strict criminal enforcement of securities laws and 
regulations should build and maintain investor confidence in the

the resource allocation function of americas financial markets

los angeles times on perus president 
when he was first elected in 1985 perus president alan 
garcia was only 36 he seemed to represent a new generation of 
leader in peru eager energetic and articulate after winning in a 
landslide garcias approval rating surged as high as 96 percent in 
some publicopinion polls largely due to his populist economic 
policies and fiercely nationalistic political rhetoric 
to overcome several years of economic stagnation his 
government overspent running up a large deficit and stimulating 
inflation that has run out of control up to an annual rate of 
1300 percent last year the highest in south america garcias 
rhetoric especially threats to stop repayment of perus 15 billion 
foreign debt frightened away the international bankers whom peru 
needs to keep capital flowing into the country today the nation 
cannot afford to import basic foodstuffs like milk and wheat garcia 
is widely blamed for the economic mess one recent poll gave him an 
approval rating of only 16 percent 
he has also been unable to defeat a leftist insurgency 
sponsored by a shadowy and violent organization known as sendero 
luminoso shining path whose leaders claim to be the only true 
heirs to the philosophy and tactics of chinas mao tsetung 
sendero luminoso was spilling blood before garcia came into 
office and perus economic troubles are similar to those faced by 
other latin american debtor nations perus damaged economy and 
dangerous political situation will remain as challenges to whoever 
follows garcia into limas presidential palace

thousands of discarded christmas trees this 
year will be tossed into lake pontchartrain gaining new life as a 
brushy dike against erosion 
its a way one family can do something positive for coastal 
restoration said robert thomas director of the louisiana nature 
and science center 
the push to recycle christmas trees began tuesday and will 
continue through jan 7 the day after epiphany when some 
louisianians take down their christmas trees 
area residents are expected to contribute as many as 7000 trees 
to build the barrier thomas said organizers also are encouraging 
christmas tree lot owners to give generously of their unsold 
merchandise 
so many years we had these christmas trees left and we cant do 
anything with them so now we can do something with them said lot 
owner danny stogner who said he is pitching in 900 trees 
the trees will be collected at designated dropoff areas and at 
the curb contractors hired by the state department of natural 
resources will dump the evergreens in the st charles parish marshes 
northwest of new orleans 
the trees will be submerged in a line to form a sill which will 
trap sediment as water washes over them the sediment will build up 
and allow plants to grow thomas said 
erosion claims as much as 60 square miles of louisiana each year 
destroying some of the nations most productive habitat for seafood 
waterfowl and animals with marketable pelts 
in 1986 in st charles parish pieces of willow trees were woven 
between stakes driven in the ground in 1987 1500 christmas trees 
were called upon for double duty there 
this year were creating bigger and better fences the ones 
we have up now are working very well said gretchen binet parish

as the days passed and gayaneys pleas for something to drink 
become more pressing her mother remembered something she had seen 
on television 
it was a program about an explorer in the arctic who was dying 
of thirst his comrade slashed open his hand and gave his friend his 
blood she said 
losing track of time because of the unchanging darkness mrs 
petrosyan doesnt know what day she cut open her fingers or how 
many times she used the method to feed her daughter 
her thoughts wandered she saw scenes of her life pass before her 
eyes and she hallucinated 
when i closed my eyes and opened them again i could see boxes 
full of apples and bottles of lemonade mrs petrosyan recalled 
i told my daughter my child there are so many things to eat and 
drink but when i reached out to touch them they were gone 
gayaney cried that she wanted to go home i want to be back in 
my bed again and see my daddy she said 
i lost all hope the mother said i was just waiting for 
death 
on dec 14 the eighth day of their captivity rescue workers 
opened a small hole that let in a shaft of light were saved 
mrs petrosyan cried 
theres a child in here be careful not to hurt her she 
screamed as they got closer 
her husband a shoemaker was uninjured by the quake he was with 
the rescuers and the two tearfully embraced mrs petrosyan was 
placed on a stretcher 
mother and daughter were flown to yerevan armenias capital 60 
miles away gayaney was taken to childrens hospital no 3 mrs 
petrosyan to the armenian national hospital 
gayaney was in intensive care for four days hooked up to 
intravenous bottles that dripped liquids into her parched body 
her temperature was dangerously low her blood alarmingly thick 
and she was in shock said dr silva nersesyan her physician the 
girl also was in a deep state of depression and wouldnt talk or 
smile 
mrs petroysan also dehydrated was given intravenous fluids and 
placed in a coffinlike box so that pressurized oxygen could be 
pumped around her as a treatment against exposure 
it was then that doctors discovered that the woman who also has 
a 7yearold son who was not hurt in the earthquake is two months 
pregnant 
doctors say both mother and daughter could be released from their 
hospitals in as little as a week but differ about whether mrs 
petrosyans blood helped keep gayaney alive 
for a child the concentration of liquids in the body is much 
more important than for an adult nersesyan said for gayaney 
her mothers blood played an important perhaps decisive role 
dr ripsime parsadanyan who treated mrs petrosyan disagrees 
susanna lost a very little even insignificant amount of blood 
what saved them was that they were together the mother didnt have 
time to panic she had to think of her child 
gayaney is still weak and has a light case of pneumonia but the 
girl with the big dark eyes has started to talk again and to smile 
in her hospital bed she strings colored yarn through cardboard 
dolls and plays with a teddy bear christmas gifts that jeb bush 
the son of presidentelect george bush gave her when he visited the 
hospital sunday 
gayaney is too young to understand what happened to her the day 
she was buried alive 
bad people pulled down the house where we were and we couldnt 
get out she said i wanted my father to come and defend us from 
those bad people but he didnt come not for a long time

a bomb blew up pan am flight 103 with 
259 people aboard as the jumbo jet flew over scotland a week ago 
the department of transport announced today 
investigators found conclusive evidence of a detonating high 
explosive in wreckage recovered from the scottish countryside 
it said the evidence was found on two parts of the metal 
luggage pallet framework a metal luggage container 
the explosives residues recovered from the debris have been 
positively identified and are consistent with the use of a 
highperformance plastic explosive the statement said 
the statement gave no further information on the type of 
explosive nor did it say where it was hidden or how it got aboard 
the aircraft it also did not speculate on who was responsible for 
the bombing or a possible motive 
in washington the state department pledged a vigorous 
investigation would be carried out by the fbi and other us 
government offices 
we are doing everything possible and using all available 
resources and sources to find out who did it spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley said we are determined to get to the bottom of this and 
find out who did it 
this operation has developed into a criminal inquiry of 
international dimensions said john boyd chief constable of the 
area in scotland where the crash occurred 
the transport ministry statement was distributed to news 
organizations in london and read to reporters in lockerbie by 
michael charles head of the air accidents investigation branch of 
the transport ministry charles declined to answer reporters 
questions after reading the statement 
lockerbie bore the brunt of the boeing 747s flaming wreckage 
when it fell out of the sky on dec 21 
the statement said evidence collected by the branch including 
the cockpit voice and flight data recorders and the trail of 
wreckage on the ground has led to the preliminary conclusion that 
the explosion took place soon after the aircraft had crossed the 
scottish border whilst it was in the cruise at 31000 feet and that 
this led directly to its destruction 
much investigative work remains to be done to establish the 
nature of the explosive device what it was contained in its 
location in the aircraft and the sequence of events immediately 
following its detonation the statement said 
it said wreckage baggage and part of the framework of a metal 
luggage pallet were being examined by ministry of defense 
scientists while more items have been collected by air accidents 
investigation branch investigators will be subjected to lengthy 
chemical and metallurgical forensic examinations 
earlier today news reports in britain said that heat damage to 
the plastic lining of a cargo bay and metal slivers found embedded 
in the bodies of passengers indicated that a bomb downed the jet 
in london meanwhile pine coffins containing the first bodies of 
americans killed in the dec 21 crash arrived at heathrow airport 
and were loaded onto two separate pan am flights bound for new york 
in scotland authorities said they had formally identified two 
more victims michael joseph doyle 30 of voorhees nj and sean 
concannon 16 of banbury england 
on tuesday night residents paid silent respects to the five 
american victims of the jumbo jet disaster whose bodies were the 
first to leave this scottish town since the new yorkbound boeing 
747 fell onto it in pieces 
all 259 people aboard were killed and 11 missing townspeople are 
presumed dead police spokesman angus kennedy said one more body was 
recovered tuesday bringing the total to 241 
more than 600 rescuers including 15 divers 30 tracker dogs and 
100 soldiers today resumed their search of the woods and icy waters 
in a 100squaremile area of southwestern scotland for the missing 
victims and wreckage which included one of the planes wings 
also today four men arrested for allegedly looting the wreckage 
were scheduled to appear in a local court 
the times report today gave details of evidence pointing to a 
bomb it quoted unidentified investigators as saying they found heat 
damage on parts of a cargo bays plastic lining caused most 
probably by an explosion among luggage 
one investigator indicated that the cargo bay lining was the 
most significant find the newspaper said it is made of kevlar 
an extremely strong but lightweight polymer compound ideally suited 
to aircraft construction 
michael yardley a terrorism expert and author told the domestic 
news agency press association that the bomb likely was a large 
device probably 10 to 20 kilos 22 to 44 pounds of a plastic 
explosive like semtex yardley is not involved in the 
investigation 
semtex is a czechoslovakianmade plastic explosive that is 
lightweight odorless and hard to detect libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi is believed to have obtained large quantities of semtex 
which is used for military and industrial purposes 
the towns tribute on tuesday to the dead appeared to be 
spontaneous reporters who are briefed two or three times daily in 
lockerbie had only about a halfhour notice of the move 
the convoy for the coffins began at a warehouse now pressed into 
use as a chapel of rest an honor guard included police mountain 
rescue teams with their dogs local officials and pan am flight 
attendants 
as a police motorcycle led the big white refrigerator van past 
the town hall the crowd surged forward 
some women wept and others bowed their heads as the van rolled 
slowly by one man saluted and another raised his hand in a gesture 
of parting 
the only sound on high street as the main street is known was a 
squeaky axle on the trailer 
residents stood silently for a couple minutes then melted into 
the night a cold rain began to fall 
kennedy the local police spokesman said it was not known when 
the next bodies would depart but the pace is expected to accelerate 
in coming days 
he identified the five americans as kenneth raymond garczynski 
37 of north brunswick nj om dixit 55 of fairborn ohio his 
wife shanti dixit 53 and their two grandchildren suruchi rattan 
3 and her 2yearold brother anmol of warren mich the childrens 
mother garima 29 was also aboard the plane but her body 
apparently has not been identified

inspections an eastern airlines boeing 727s found a 
fuselage crack in a jet in roughly the same area where a 14inch 
hole tore open in another plane forcing an emergency landing the 
airline said today 
eastern officials in boston said the boeing 727 was grounded for 
repairs at logan international airport after company inspectors 
discovered the 3inch crack in the fuselage monday night 
the airline ordered the inspections of its boeing 727 fleet after 
a 14inch hole tore open in the fuselage of an atlantabound 727 on 
monday forcing it to make an emergency landing in charleston 
wva when its cabin depressurized 
were doing it on our own spokeswoman karen ceremsak said 
from easterns headquarters in miami its just as a precautionary 
measure following yesterdays incident we know that eastern 
airlines is safe we hope that professionalism will prevail 
no problems were found in the other planes that were inspected 
she said today 
on tuesday federal officials investigating the forced landing of 
atlantabound flight 251 said the plane had problems maintaining 
cabin pressure shortly after takeoff from rochester ny before 
the roof ripped open 
by the time they reached 31000 feet they were able to 
stabilize the pressure although the hole in the fuselage soon 
developed said national transportation safety board spokesman ted 
lopatkiewicz 
there was no indication what caused the initial problem he said 
a 5inch crack had been found on the fuselage in an inspection in 
july 1986 although the plane had been cleared to fly in an 
inspection as recently as september federal aviation administration 
officials said 
on orders from eastern mechanics spent monday night and tuesday 
inspecting 17 of the airlines 100series 727s and 28 of the 
200series model 
during the inspection of the 727s up in boston we uncovered a 
727 that had a 3inch crack in the crown said airline spokesman 
robin matell who added that the crack was in roughly the same 
area as the hole in the plane in charleston 
executives of the financially troubled airline insist their 
safety record is one of the industrys best and blame disgrunted 
labor union officials for suggesting eastern has a safety problem 
the airlines unions complained this year that eastern employees 
were being pressured to bypass safety procedures 
however an investigation by the faa which included inspection 
of every eastern plane reported the airline was safe but expressed 
concern over labormanagement strife that could have an adverse 
impact on the public safety 
on sunday an eastern a300 bound for newark nj had to return 
to miami international airport because of an engine problem on 
tuesday a fort lauderdalebound eastern a300 turned back to new 
yorks laguardia airport after a problem with a door prevented the 
plane from being properly pressurized 
two ntsb representatives from washington were in charleston today 
to examine the plane used on flight 251 it could be six months 
before a final determination is made on what happened said ntsb 
investigator pamela kleckner 
a few investigators are still working on the plane she said 
today it may not move until thursday morning 
ceremsak said that the jet would be temporarily repaired and then 
will be flown to atlanta its original destination or miami the 
airlines headquarters 
as federal investigators began the investigation they also said 
records for the past five years show the plane had made seven 
unscheduled landings in the last five years before this week but 
none could be called an emergency landing 
the section of the fuselage that developed the hole was a 
replacement part not the original skin of the plane 
the piece that peeled away would be taken to a laboratory for 
metallurgical tests 
fred farrar the faas spokesman said seven unplanned landings 
in five years is not unusual for a 22yearold airplane and bobbie 
mardis of the faas safety data branch in oklahoma city said it was 
not unusual for a plane to develop cracks like those on the 727 
inspectors do periodic inspections and cracks are one of the 
items they look for she said its part of normal wear and 
tear

the agriculture department proposed wednesday 
to reduce import restrictions on shipments of british swine pork 
and pork products 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said the proposal is a result of 
great britains eradication of hog cholera a contagious and 
sometimes fatal disease of swine he said no case of the disease has 
been reported since august 1987 
the restriction currently requires that pork and pork products be 
cooked heated or cured and dried before being shipped from britain 
to ensure that disease organisms were destroyed 
under the proposed rule change small quantities of untreated 
pork and pork products for personal consumption will be allowed to 
enter the united states from britain however commercial shipments 
must orginate only from plants which meet us requirements 
glosser said the proposal would affect some us swine producers 
who have expressed a desire to import swine breeding stock or semen 
from britain however he said these expected shipments would not 
have an impact on us swine production 
the proposal will be open for public comments until feb 27 
those should be sent to regulatory analysis and development aphis

teenagers wednesday during a clash with youths in the west bank and 
killed three suspected guerrillas trying to sneak into israel from 
lebanon the army said 
the infiltration attempt was the second reported in the area this 
week israel radio quoted an army captain as saying an israeli 
patrol at the border fence spotted the guerrillas

clash in the citys central market area

19yearold jibril jaber hirsh the army and israel radio said arab 
reports said troops opened fire on arab youths who hurled rocks at 
israeli workers repairing an electrical line near the village 
the two deaths raised to at least 339 the number of palestinians 
slain since the uprising began on dec 8 1987 fourteen israelis 
also have died 
also wednesday eight palestinians were wounded by army gunfire 
in west bank and gaza strip clashes arab doctors said the army 
said it was checking the reports 
curfews were imposed on four refugee camps in the gaza strip 
confining 150000 palestinians to their homes the army said the 
deheisha refugee camp near bethlehem in the west bank also was put 
under curfew it said 
meanwhile the hebrew daily davar reported wednesday that israeli 
attorney general yosef harish this week told the army he will 
reexamine the use of plastic bullets because of rising deaths from

members had engaged in an unspecified shootout with israeli troops 
the front is a small radical splinter group of the plo

president roh taewoo ordered a 
crackdown wednesday on all illegal demonstrations and said violent 
protests are a major threat to the nations democratic and economic 
stability 
the opposition said the government was afraid of lowing power 
top opposition leader kim daejung said rohs directive was a plot 
schemed by fascists not to lose their invested rights 
he said government hardliners were attempting to create a false 
sense of crisis to frighten people into supporting roh and 
justifying restraints on government opponents 
roh spoke in an unsually tough nationally televised address he 
issued a special directive to security forces to take immediate 
steps to end all violent and illegal protests by opposition and 
labor groups and he said officials who failed to enforce law and 
order would be dismissed 
unlawful and disorderly developments and excessive demands 
gushing forth in the course of liquidating authoritarianism are 
threatening not only democracy but also the stability of the free 
economy roh told a meeting of key government officials 
government leaders are concerned protests could increase 
opposition to roh because the public already is angry over 
corruption and human rights abuses under former president chun 
doohwan roh is trying to block widespread demands that chun be 
punished 
radical students and dissidents have staged a series of violent 
protests in recent months to demand the overthrow of the roh 
government radicals also have staged scattered attacks on 
government and us military facilities 
the protests have been small compared to major antigovernment 
protests in 1987 but officials have expressed concern at the 
increasing use of violence by radicals 
roh said the radicals use of firebombs and homemade explosives 
in protests have reached a serious phase no deaths and just a 
few serious injuries have been reported in recent protests

violent extremists would not be allowed to pose a threat to national 
stability or the desire of the great majority of koreans for orderly 
change

hardliners unhappy about political protests and growth of opposition 
and leftist groups 
chun a former general who took power with military backing in

american high school students have an alarming 
deficit of economic knowledge according to a survey in which 
twothirds didnt understand profits and more than half couldnt 
supply a definition for demand 
economic education is not in the kind of shape wewant it to 
be former federal reserve board chairman paul a volcker said 
wednesday at a news conference sponsored by joint council on 
economic education a nonprofit coalition that underwrote the 
survey 
the survey a 46question multiple choice exam taken in may 1986 
by 8205 11th and 12thgrade students in public and private high 
schools in 42 states found 
only 34 percent could correctly define profits as revenues 
minus costs 
39 percent selected the correct definition of gross national 
product the market value of the nations output of final goods 
and services 
only 45 percent realized that government deficits result when 
spending exceeds tax revenues 
less than half 477 percent knew that economic demand 
for a product refers to how much people are willing and able to 
buy at each price 
the news is not good if you believe that a basic understanding 
of our economic system is important if this country is indeed to be 
effective in what everyone realizes is a period of global 
competition said volcker who confessed that he himself had never 
taken economics in high school 
the exam was the first to document a paucity of economic 
knowledge among us students 
economics thus joins a growing list of disciplines including 
writing geography foreign language science and math where recent 
tests have shown us students achieving at dismal levels 
the test of economic literacy was devised by william b 
walstad a university of nebraskalincoln economics professor and 
john c soper an economics professor at john carroll university in 
cleveland 
walstad urged states and school districts to make economics a 
part of the curriculum from elementary school on to require it for 
high school graduation and to provide teachers with the necessary 
background to teach it 
teachers are the first to realize that they have inadequate 
background in the subject said roxanne e bradshaw 
secretarytreasurer of the national education association the 19 
millionmember teacher union 
japan requires all high school students to take at least a 
semester of economics walstad said but only 28 states require 
economics in the curriculum in some form and just 15 require a 
specific course in economics for graduation 
all too often economics is simply left out of the list of 
required subjects in recent calls for educational reform walstad 
said 
on average students correctly answered only about 40 percent of 
the test questions but they did even more poorly on questions 
pertaining to inflation the effects of tariffs on trade and the 
impact of investment on economic growth 
economic illiteracy is apparently even more pronounced among 
minority students 
among students who had some high school economics whites scored 
an average of 53 percent while blacks scored 42 percent and 
hispanics 46 percent 
among youngsters who had taken no economics courses whites 
answered 41 percent of the questions correctly blacks 33 percent 
and hispanics 36 percent 
rudolph oswald director of research of the aflcio called the 
results appalling 
they rationalize better than any series of speeches the reasons 
why organized labor feels it can only gain from an economically 
literate population oswald said

south korea on wednesday agreed to 
north koreas proposal for highlevel political and military talks 
to ease tension with the eventual goal of reuniting the rival 
nations after more than 43 years 
prime minister kang younghoon accepted north koreas nov 16 
proposal he suggested in a letter to his north korean counterpart 
yon hyung muk that they head sevenmember delegations to 
alternating talks in seoul capital of south korea and pyongyang 
capital of north korea 
kang offered to discuss ending mutual slandering building 
mutual trust in military matters and promoting exchanges in 
various areas 
he also suggested discussing a meeting between south korean 
president roh taewoo and north korean president kim il sung 
to wipe out mutual distrust and restore trust between them the 
two koreas should recognize each others ideologies and systems 
conduct dialogue on the basis of mutual respect and noninterference 
and develop cooperative relations on the principle of mutuality 
kang said in the letter which was delivered to north korea at the 
panmunjom truce site in the demilitarized zone 
kang also asked that preparatory contacts be made in panmunjom in 
february to discuss procedural matters for the proposed prime 
ministers talks with vice ministerlevel officials as chief 
delegates 
north korea had proposed wideranging talks on reducing military 
strength but south korea did not refer to troop reduction and its 
proposal was more vague 
kang did not refer to pyongyangs proposal that the talks discuss 
withdrawing us troops from south korea about 42000 us troops 
are in south korea under a mutual defense pact 
he indirectly rejected north koreas bid for threeway talks by 
saying in his letter that korean peace and unification are basically 
our national problems that should be resolved between the the two 
parties concerned 
on dec 20 north korea renewed its bid for tripartite talks 
involving the two koreas and the united states to discuss american 
pullout and a mutual reduction of the two koreas armed forces 
north korea says the american military presence hinders korean 
unification 
south korea said the prime ministers should head the delegations 
but north korea had proposed deputy prime ministers procedural 
matters have been a major problem in arranging interkorean talks in 
the past 
the koreas each have been pressing major initiatives to end their 
long bitter confrontation each side has tended to stress its own 
initiatives and play down the others proposals 
delegations of lawmakers from both sides planned to resume 
negotiations thursday in panmunjom to clear the way for fullscale 
parliamentary talks on nonaggression and other matters south korea 
expects the full talks to be held next spring 
talks held intermittently since 1972 on reducing tension failed 
to make progress 
seoul officials have expressed mistrust about north koreas 
intentions they say north koreas insistence on discussing 
withdrawal of us troops indicated pyongyang may be using the talks 
to try to weaken south korea 
south korean officials say american forces are needed for the 
foreseeable future to prevent a north korean attack american 
officials have said the forces will remain as long as south korea 
wants them 
the two koreas have hundreds of thousand of troops facing each 
other along the 150mile border the border is sealed and the only 
communication link is a hot line 
us and soviet forces divided the korean peninsula when they 
ended the japanese occupation at the end of world war ii in 1945 
north korea invaded south korea in 1950 starting the threeyear 
korean war

authorities found the charred bodies of 
44 suspected antigovernment militants along roads in southern sri 
lanka a police official said wednesday 
the officer who asked not to be identified said the victims had 
been shot to death and then burned earlier in the week 
in a communique the government blamed the slayings in the south 
on the peoples revolutionary red army which materialized slightly 
more than a month ago to counter terrorism by sinhalese radicals 
the charred bodies were found along roads in southern sri lanka 
the sinhalese heartland the officer said 
at least 19 bodies were found on monday and tuesday near 
tissamaharama about 110 miles south of colombo the officer said 
other bodies were discovered in nearby towns of dickwella 
middeniya tangalle weerakatiya and lunagamvegara he added 
an extremist sinhalese group the peoples liberation front 
oppose the governments efforts to end the 5yearold insurgency by 
militant tamils demanding a separate homeland in the northern and 
eastern provinces more than 8500 people have died in the fighting 
in other violence the officer said a sri lankan sailor was shot 
and killed by tamil guerrillas in in jaffna 196 miles north of 
colombo on tuesday an indian soldier was killed when he was caught 
in a sniper fire in jaffna town on tuesday he said 
the tamils are mostly hindu and make up 18 percent of the 
islands population they have long accused the majority sinhalese 
of denying they jobs and education the sinhalese predominantly 
buddhists make up 75 percent of the population 
the sinhalesedominanted government signed an accord in july 1987 
offering limited autonomy to the tamils 
while militant tamils say the accord does not meet enough demands 
for selfrule sinhalese extremists contend the accord grants too 
many concessions and have vowed to kill anyone who supports the 
agreement 
india has an estimated 47000 troops in sri lanka to enforce the 
peace accord 
front members have been blamed for more than 900 murders since 
the accord was signed 17 months ago most of the victims have been 
supporters of the governing united national party or security 
personnel 
the peoples revolutionary red army surfaced about a month before 
the dec 19 presidential election and began hunting front members 
authorities have said they believe the red army is comprised of 
members of paramilitary units a leftist political organization and 
a tamil rebel group

president reagan on wednesday extended the 
territorial waters of the united states from three miles to 12 miles 
to conform to the standard set down by a united nations agreement in 
1982 
the presidential proclamation said the extension will give the 
united states for an additional nine miles offshore a 
sovereignty and jurisdiction that extend to the airspace over the 
territorial sea as well as to its bed and subsoil 
assistant white house press secretary bob hall said the action 
was taken because almost all other countries in the world use the 
12mile limit and the un convention on the law of the sea had 
called on all nations to conform 
the president said the action will advance the national 
security and other significant interests of the united states 
the proclamation said the new limit applies to the territorial 
sea of the united states of america the commonwealth of puerto 
rico guam american samoa the united states virgin islands the 
commonwealth of the northern mariana islands and any other 
territory or possession over which the united states exercises 
sovereignty 
reagan said ships of all countries would continue to have the 
right of innocent passage through us territorial waters and 
ships and aircraft of all countries would have the right of 
transit passage through international straits 
he said the proclamation does not extend or alter existing 
federal or state law or impair the determination of maritime 
boundaries

an arms control treaty which deeply reduces 
us nuclear arsenals could hurt american national security unless 
new and better protected atomic weapons are built a study said 
wednesday 
one of the solutions to the problem is the building and 
deployment of 300 to 500 of the socalled midgetman singlewarhead 
atomic weapons said the report by the center for strategic and 
international studies 
the yearlong study was the latest round in what is expected to 
be a major national security battle within the administration of 
presidentelect bush over the future of us nuclear forces 
the united states and the soviets are negotiating at the 
strategic arms reduction talks start for a 50 percent cut in the 
longrange atomic arsenals of each country 
at the same time those talks are going ahead the pentagon faces 
serious budget problems because defense spending is likely to be 
frozen for the foreseeable future despite plans by each of the 
services to buy more weapons the study said 
the study was produced by a leading conservative thinktank 
among participants in the report were thomas moorer former chairman 
of the joint chiefs of staff and joseph nye and walter slocombe 
two senior state department officials from the carter administration 
any start treaty is likely to require the reduction of large 
numbers of us atomic weapons the study noted 
it warned that start without a modernization program to 
improve the survivability and effectiveness of remaining us 
forces could be deleterious to us deterrent policy 
the report suggested building a poststart arsenal which includes 
300 to 500 of the midgetman weapons each of which would be 
deployed in a mobile mode in its own silo 
18 to 20 trident missilefiring submarines a trident force 
generally smaller than planned by the navy 
deployment of 100 stealth b2 bombers by the end of the century 
the air force is now planning to buy 132 of the radarevading planes 
at an estimated cost of 68 billion the plane which was unveiled 
to the public a month ago would be in addition to the 100 b1 
bombers already built 
the study proposed the three classes of weapons as the new 
members of the us nuclear triad which includes land and 
seabased missiles and manned bombers 
the biggest fight is likely over the landbased missiles which 
are intended to replace the aging force of minuteman weapons 
congress has already approved construction of 50 mx weapons to 
be placed in fixed silos but the reagan administration is pushing 
for 50 more of the 10warhead weapons for placement aboard trains 
eventually all 100 mx weapons would be moved to the trains 
according to administration officials 
congressional democrats have backed the singlewarhead midgetman 
and the current pentagon budget bill directs bush to make a decision 
by march 31 about whether to continue spending research money for 
both the railbased mx and the midgetman 
building up to 500 midgetman weapons would cost an estimated 30 
billion while the railbased mx weapon would cost an estimated 13 
billion the study noted

allies in europe and asia should bear a larger 
share of mutual defense costs but that would not justify reductions 
in us military spending the reagan administration said wednesday 
the european countries japan as well can afford to invest 
more in their defense programs than they are doing today they 
should do this the requirement is there the ability to pay is 
there said deputy defense secretary william h taft iv 
we have unmet security needs and we have allies who in 
terms of their prosperity can afford do more to meet those and they 
should do that taft told a news conference at which he presented 
a report that was signed by defense secretary frank c carlucci and 
secretary of state george p shultz 
although the united states is less able than some of its allies 
to boost security spending said taft the assumption of a greater 
burden by other western nations would not justify cuts in the 
american defense budget 
the way we have addressed this is not as an opportunity for the 
united states to do less than it is doing he said our view is 
and we have been emphatic about this throughout the discussion is 
that the united states needs to do at least as much as it is doing 
that it can afford to do what it is doing 
likewise said taft the announcement by kremlin lof mr gorbachev 
are extremely welcome and are the 
results of our having done more and that if we really want to make 
sure that they will be followed up on we should keep on doing what 
we have been doing 
taft said that domestic political considerations kept a number of 
us allies from increasing their defense spending and he praised 
the process of consultation and negotiation that he said had 
bolstered the security budgets of several key nations 
japan and korea have increased their defense spending he said 
and we have also seen in europe a halt to what had been a downward 
trend in the united kingdom and in west germany 
among the 16 members of the north atlantic treaty organization 
the report identified five that were not meeting the goal of 
spending 3 percent of gross national product per year on defense 
canada denmark italy luxembourg and spain 
it said that canada and luxembourg were not meeting the nato norm 
in terms of activeduty and reserve manpower and that belgium 
denmark luxembourg and norway were not meeting their nato 
commitments for deployments of both troops and equipment 
the united states britain greece and turkey are making 
significant contributions relative to their ability it said 
italy seems to qualify as a special case in that it is 
making major efforts to substantially improve the report said 
the netherlands and norway comprise a middle group of nations 
with regard to resources allocated to defense because theyould be increased 
is being 
increased and we welcome that and we support it 
the report echoed the findings of a statement issued dec 1 by 
nato defense ministers who found significant differences between 
individual national contributions 
it said the united states devoted an average 598 percent of its 
economic output to defense 19831987 greece topped that spending 
652 percent during the same period 
the united kingdom earmarked 501 percent of its gdp to defense 
turkey averaged 4 percent and germany 32 percent 
others were belgium 326 percent canada 217 percent 
denmark 22 percent italy 216 percent luxembourg 118 percent 
netherlands 332 percent norway 293 percent portugal 322 
percent and spain 237 percent the figures were adjusted for 
inflation 
france and spain are the only members of the 16nation alliance 
not party to its integrated military structure iceland was not 
included in either the nato or the reagan administration list of 
nato contributors

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze blasted 
consular officials on wednesday for not treating soviets living 
abroad humanely and called for lifting the stigma of class enemy 
from emigres 
also on wednesday a literary newspaper said a civil war with 
emigres should be stopped 
the developments may signal a new drive by president mikhail s 
gorbachevs administration to woo soviet emigres to support his 
reform drive from abroad or even to return gorbachev has said the 
soviet union is suffering from a brain drain as scientists 
writers and other intellectuals emigrate by the thousands 
shevardnadze in a speech to soviet consular officials and 
diplomats summarized by the official news agency tass said 
serious defects mainly a disregard for the human factor 
mar the handling of visas passports and other consular documents 
humanization of the consular service both in reinforcing it 
with firstclass personnel and from the viewpoint of attention to 
the main object of its functions the person is one of the main 
goals of its restructuring the foreign minister said 
the weak humanitarian aspect of the soviet consular service 
is partly to blame for problems in human rights reunification of 
families and mixed marriages shevardnadze said 
he said so far there have been no cardinal improvements 
because of problems in the consular services soviet emigres who 
number 20 million have suffered along with soviet citizens living 
abroad shevardnadze said 
quite a few of those have been classified as our class 
enemies today are doing much good for our country consular offices 
must expand the circle of countrymen discovering their homeland 
anew shevardnadze said in remarks quoted at a news briefing by 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
the foreign minister suggested an emigrant lobby be formed 
abroad to promote contacts between the countries in which they live 
and the soviet union 
many soviet intellectuals decry the countrys loss of great 
artists writers ballet dancer and filmmakers to the west and say 
their work would be enriched by renewed contact the label 
traitor attached to many of the prominent emigres has been 
disappearing in a soviet press campaign works by joseph brodsky a 
sovietborn writer living in the united states and sovietborn film 
director andrei tarkovsky who died in paris two years ago have 
appeared in their native land 
other prominent emigre cultural figures such as theater director 
yuri lyubimov have returned home to visit or work 
literaturnaya gazeta a weekly literary newspaper said emigres 
should be welcomed home and that the practice of stripping soviets 
of citizenship should be outlawed 
its time to end the longtime civil war its time to conduct 
engage in open disputes with tolerance and without hostility 
the newspaper said 
shevardnadze said a draft parliamentary decree simplifies 
procedures for soviets and foreigners to travel to and from the 
soviet union he did not give details but indicated the 
streamlining was aimed largely at making it easier for foreign 
businessmen to travel to and from the soviet union 
in may soviet consulates were obliged to issue visas within 48 
hours to foreign business people technicians and scientists who 
have established contacts with the soviet union 
the foreign minister called on the soviet union to join the 1963 
vienna convention on consular relations in the past the kremlin 
has said the agreement was flawed because it didnt provide for the 
inviolability of consular buildings and allows local authorities to 
interfere in meetings between jailed citizens and consular officials 
shevardnadze conceded soviet officials have tended to be too 
securityconscious and this was hurting the drive to improve trade 
with the foreign companies 
those who take care of the security of the state must realize 
that a true threat to our country will arise when we find ourselves 
economically insolvent and will not be able to get the feel of 
worldwide economic progress and to join the mainstream of scientific 
and technological progress he said

the administration on wednesday urged china to 
remove restrictions on the travel of us diplomats saying it was 
considering whether to further limit the movement of chinese envoys 
in america 
the dispute grew out of severe limitations placed by china on the 
travel of american officials stationed at the us consulate in the 
northeastern chinese city of shenyang last year 
in response the united states banned officials at the chinese 
consulate in chicago from driving beyond the city and its suburbs 
without permission the us decision was mandated by the 1982 
foreign missions act which demands reciprocal action by the state 
department in response to limitations against us diplomats abroad 
state department officials describe the sanctions controversy as 
a minor irritant to their otherwise good relations which have been 
feted this month in celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of 
diplomatic ties we dont feel its a major disruption said one 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the united states 
hopes that the chinese side will join us in seeking to remove the 
restrictions 
but the united states was disappointed by the inconclusive 
result of talks on the subject held earlier this month in beijing as 
part of semiannual discussions on reciprocity issues other such 
issues include housing space for diplomats permission for 
diplomats wives to work and customs clearance regulations 
in response to the ruling against the chicago consulate china 
imposed travel restrictions on the us consulate in the southern 
port city of shanghai several weeks ago and further limited the 
shenyang consulate officials 
diplomats at these two missions are now required to obtain 
permission for travel 48 hours in advance 
diplomats at the us embassy in beijing and at the chinese 
embassy in washington have always been required to notify 
authorities of their intention to travel but in the united states 
this is only a formality china restricts travel to certain cities 
it has declared closed areas for military reasons 
we consider the chinese restrictions to be unreasonable since 
they go well beyond restrictions on their diplomats here oakley 
said 
we have not made any decisions regarding future actions which 
we might take in the wake of these latest chinese restrictions 
imposed on us diplomats in shenyang and shanghai she said 
the foreign mission act does not proscribe a strict titfortat 
leaving it to the administration to decide whether to retaliate for 
the shanghai restrictions or to make do with the ban placed on the 
chicago consulate said the official who asked not to be named 
the situation does not necessarily have to escalate the 
official said 
the united states has four consulates in china in addition to 
the embassy and china has five here 
travel restrictions against diplomats worldwide are also designed 
to prevent espionage activity the united states requires soviet and 
east bloc diplomats to apply for permission to travel beyong a 
25mile radius from their posts

europe vowed wednesday to stand up to 
washington in john wayne fashion after the reagan administration 
said it would slap extra duties on european imports in retaliation 
for a ban on us beef treated with hormones 
european trade officials were almost unanimous in their 
condemnation of the us sanctions which will add 100 million in 
additional duties to european economic community exports to the 
united states 
the 12nation eec now is expected to counter with its own set of 
retaliatory sanctions on us food products 
jacques delors president of the european commission said the 
us decision was an unacceptable interference with the right each 
country has to decide what is good or not for the health of its 
citizens 
the european commission is the executive body of the european 
community the umbrella group of the eec trading partnership 
the reagan adminstration said tuesday it would impose the 
sanctions after the eec said it would ban imports of beef treated 
with growthinducing hormones the ban is to go into effect jan 1 
the united states is a principal exporter of hormonetreated beef 
european commissioner willy de clercq called the sanctions 
totally unjustifiable and contrary to international standards 
de clercq pointed out that the eec ban on hormonetreated beef 
applies to all nations that export to the european trading bloc 
several eec states already have banned the use of all hormones 
for cattle breeding the eec itself has banned seven specific 
hormones 
consumer groups both in europe and the united states say such 
hormones which make beef cattle grow larger pose potential health 
threats to humans the us food and drug administration says there 
is no evidence such hormones can harm human health 
argentina australia brazil and new zealand already have agreed 
to export only hormonefree meat to the eec but the united states 
and canada refused to accept the ban 
nine days ago eec ministers agreed on a list of us products on 
which an equivalent amount of duties would be slapped if the us 
enforced its threat to retaliate against the hormones ban 
us officials in turn vow to would match any move by the 
common market 
alfred kingon us ambassador to the eec said wednesday that if 
the common market goes ahead with its countermeasures i think 
its fair to say that you can anticipate further action on our 
side 
but kenneth warren chairman of britains house of commons trade 
and industry committee said europe must not back down 
i really do not see why we have to buy what we dont want to 
eat he said 
warren a member of the governing conservative party said on 
british broadcasting corporation radio that americans are great at 
brinkmanship we have to face them down in typical john wayne 
fashion 
these trade wars are threatened every now and again warren 
said we have just got to look forward to a few nights of 
negotiations to clear it away it wont benefit the americans and we 
have got to talk sense into them 
but simon gourlay president of britains national farmers 
union said he was against the eec ban claiming that natural 
hormones are beneficial for improved growth rate and improve the 
quality of meat 
there are no detrimental side effects at all gourlay told 
the bbc as farmers we have sympathy with the americans 
west german parliamentary undersecretary for agriculture wolfgang 
von geldern said the us trade sanctions were unnecessary and 
economically unjustified 
geldern said the united states was trying to set an example 
apparently for political reasons although the eec had built 
golden bridges to the united states 
he added that there already was an oversupply of beef in the eec 
and the united states and that there was no need to artificially 
raise production 
undersecretary of agriculture dimitris kefalidis of greece gave 
full support to any eec counterretaliation to the us trade 
sanctions greece will have to take a position in favor of the 
meat ban he said we take the issue of hormones in meat very 
seriously 
richard kaiser head of austrias cattle and meat commission 
told the austrian news agency that under an agreement with 
washington us meat exported to austria contained no hormones

it will be the social street event of the 
season a new years eve gala complete with a glittering ball 
dropped from the citys tallest building at the stroke of midnight 
all right so the marquette plaza building is only nine stories 
high the ball is a secondhand disco globe purchased for 250 and 
theres no clock for the crowd to watch 
but its a lot closer than times square say organizers who are 
counting on rhode islanders wellknown distaste for travel to 
ensure a good turnout 
to some people around here going 11 miles to providence is a 
major decision said tony makalinaw one of the businessmen who 
concocted the event to cap the citys centennial celebration we 
figure theyll be more willing to leave their tv and go out if they 
only have to go a mile or two to social street 
the city will rely on local ingenuity rather than help from the 
veteran balldroppers of new york makalinaw said 
well start the ball down the cable at a signal from the 
mayor he said well have these little twoway radios and a 
guy on top of the building will lower it by hand 
no clock will be displayed and makalinaw said that could lead to 
confusion well have to synchronize our watches somehow he 
said i guess well go by new york time

yelling blood for blood rallied in central nanking on wednesday 
in the fourth day of antiafrican demonstrations triggered by a 
fight at a dance 
hundreds of helmeted riot police with truncheons hit 
demonstrators and shoved others into police vans as the protesters 
surged into a large intersection 
it was not clear if there were injuries or if those pushed into 
vans were arrested after several hours the crowd began to disperse 
and streets of this eastern city were quiet by midnight 
the africans students have been forced into hiding by the mobs 
an american who was with the africans said the 140 students have 
been kept in a factory guesthouse in suburban nanking since monday 
the american 20yearold heather mcmillen of portland ore 
said black students are determined to go to their embassies in 
beijing 
one of the students from mali already left late wednesday 
i would be with them but i have important examinations and i 
must graduate said the student at nanking polytechnlcal institute 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
chinese youths in a repeat of a tuesday night rally began 
gathering about 630 pm they shouted slogans such as blood for 
blood but unlike protesters sunday and monday they did not use 
racial slurs 
in the beginning it was beat the black devils but we dont 
support that any more said student li min 23 now were 
calling on the government to support law and order 
police used a loudspeaker to order the protesters to leave 
saying their activities were destroying peace and affecting the 
unity of the people city authorities have warned that 
unauthorized demonstrations are illegal 
at 9 pm about 700 protesters marched to a hotel that 
accommodates mainly foreigners and stood outside for about an hour 
before dispersing 
chinese officials say there have been no arrests of either 
africans or chinese since the trouble began saturday protesters 
said some of their companions were put in police vans tuesday night 
but most were released hours later 
chinas worst outbreak of racial violence in years began saturday 
night with a fight between chinese guards at hehai university and 
african students who refused to register chinese girlfriends they 
were taking to a campus party 
thousand of chinese students learning that 11 chinese were hurt

africans

were thrown at several european women 
i dont feel comfortable walking outside said miss mcmillen 
a tourist who was visiting friends in nanking 
in the past decade china has welcomed foreign technology and 
learning but closer contacts with foreigners whose living 
conditions are usually better than those of chinese has bred 
resentment 
relations with african students have been especially tense 
because of widespread dislike of blacks among chinese 
a mali student in beijing billy sissoko said not a day goes 
by when im not insulted today someone looked at my skin and asked 
me after six years in china why havent you become whiter

the pentagon said wednesday that air force 
officials are reviewing court documents to decide whether to take 
action against a top procurement official accused of helping 
industry contacts in exchange for money 
the documents unsealed by a federal magistrate on tuesday 
allege that victor d cohen a deputy to the assistant air force 
secretary for acquisitions has given illegal assistance to defense 
consultant william galvin and his clients who have received 
contracts worth millions of dollars 
cohens participation has ranged from providing galvins 
clients with proprietary information to structuring procurements in 
a manner that eliminates competition one of the affidavits said 
the affidavit filed by the fbi and based primarily on wiretaps 
called cohen a constant source of information and assistance to 
galvin it said also that galvin and three of his clients unisys 
corp loral electronic systems division and cubic corp appear to 
have paid cohen for his help 
the document says cohens assistance to galvins clients can 
clearly be traced to illegal payments and gratuities provided to him 
by galvin or the clients 
the affidavit gives no figure for total payments to cohen but 
alleges that cohen has been involved with galvin in illegal 
activity since 1982 the only allegedly illegal payment specified 
is a check for 2500 from galvin to cohen dated january 1982 which 
was recorded as a deposit to cohens account 
maj donna pastor an air force spokeswoman said the air force 
has obtained copies of the affidavits and is reviewing them to 
determine if any actions are appropriate 
a receptionist in cohens office said he was on leave and 
could not be reached for comment his home telephone number is 
unpublished 
cohen was relieved of his contracting responsibilities last june 
and has been given a special assignment that does not involve 
ongoing contractual activities pastor said four other pentagon 
employees who were subjects of the investigation also were relieved 
of their contracting duties 
the affidavit was filed to justify a search of cohens potomac 
md house his home and office were among 40 locations raided by 
fbi agents last june when the case was first revealed no 
indictments have been handed down 
prosecutors have said they have evidence a hearing is scheduled for 
friday to determine whether the 
those portions should remain sealed 
the two other affidavits supported searches of the berwyn 
heights md house of richard seelmeyer a selfemployed 
consultant and the rockville md home and office of consultant 
bill sanda those searches were carried out with the others in june 
most of the allegations in the affidavit regarding cohen were 
based on information obtained from wiretaps on galvins office phone 
and a bugging device in his office 
the eavesdropping the government alleges show that cohens 
assistance to galvins clients is so well known that galvin is not 
modest in describing his relationship to cohen 
in one conversation in galvins office galvin jokingly 
responded to a client that had suggested that galvin have cohen work 
for him when cohen leaves the air force that cohen already worked 
for him and that the client should know that 
the phone number for galvins office has been disconnected and 
his home phone went unanswered wednesday 
the seelmeyer affidavit said the former aide to rep joseph a 
addabbo dny operated a small airplane used by unisys to provide 
flights for members of congress information in the document was 
based on wiretaps on the home and office phones of charlie gardner 
a retired unisys official and outside consultant for the company 
the affidavit charges that gardner and others have sought to 
corruptly influence congressional legislation on defense programs 
through payment of monies and gratuities to selected congressmen 
charles fc ruff a unisys lawyer said wednesday he had no 
comment on the allegations 
on several occasions according to the affidavit gardner 
mentioned seelmeyers role in planning a trip from washington to new 
york for rep roy dyson dmd last may gardner said several times 
that if seelmeyer were to talk he could do a lot of damage and 
that payments to seelmeyer are to keep him quiet as to some of his 
prior activities the document said 
dyson has denied any impropriety in the trip during which he 
visited a unisys facility 
those who answered the phone at seelmeyers home hung up when 
requests were made to speak with him the post quoted him as saying 
i didnt have any role in making that trip i knew they were 
going up there but that was it 
the sanda affidavit refers to the relationship between sanda and 
consultant william parkin also a subject of the searches the two 
allegedly provided inside information to unisys and other defense 
contractors 
large portions of this affidavit were deleted

600000 tons of soybean meal earlier in the month the soviets had 
canceled purchases of more than 300000 tons of meal 
in a separate announcement usda said china has bought an 
additional 200000 tons of wheat at subsidized prices part of 1 
million tons authorized for china on dec 7 only 10000 tons remain 
in that authorization 
the latest sales of corn to the kremlin brought the soviet 
unions total to 963 million tons in the agreements sixth year 
which began oct 1 last year us corn sales to the soviet union 
totaled slightly less than 52 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 600000 tons of 
corn would be about 236 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 263 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usda estimates meaning that the latest 
sale could have a farm value of around 62 million 
the soybean meal based on recent decatur ill prices could 
have a processor value of around 144 million

the pact the soviets have ordered 500000 tons of soybeans and 
1132500 tons of soybean meal plus 500000 tons of grain sorghum

extension of the previous fiveyear grain agreement which had

through dec 31 1990 
under terms of the agreement the soviet union is committed to 
buy at least 9 million tons of us grain annually including a 
minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn 
the soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million 
tons as wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting as 
two tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
in the case of chinas wheat purchases the 200000 tons will be

commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to 
meet foreign competition the exporters then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses or subsidies 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said the bonuses will average 2307 
per ton of wheat or about 63 cents per bushel 
the the eep sales were handled by continental grain co 40000 
tons garnac grain co 40000 nissho iwai american corp 30000

in good news for the economy the government 
reported wednesday that american businesses are planning to spend a 
record 45164 billion on expansion and modernization plans in the 
new year 
the commerce department said a survey completed in november found 
that us businesses are projecting a 59 percent increase in 
investment spending in 1989 over an expected total of 42649 
billion for 1988 
if these spending plans are realized it would mean that 1988 and 
1989 would set backtoback spending records surpassing the old 
oneyear record of 39558 billion set in 1985 
the boom in investment spending this year has been credited with 
providing much of the momentum for the overall economy analysts saw 
it as a good sign that businesses are planning to further expand 
investment next year although at a slower pace 
the 59 percent rise in business investment expected for 1989 
contrasts with a 108 percent jump in spending in 1988 the biggest 
percentage increase since a 166 percent rise in 1984 
all of the figures have been adjusted to remove the effects of 
inflation 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc in lexington 
mass said he expected the government survey taken in october and 
november was understating investment plans somewhat and that later 
investment surveys will show even more optimism 
in 1988 business investment and us export sales have 
contributed almost half of the growth in the overall economy which 
is expected to come in above 35 percent this year as measured by 
the gross national product 
the record level of export sales have prompted much of the 
business investment as us manufacturers have rushed to meet the 
higher overseas demand 
for 1989 wyss said he expected growth would slow to around 26 
percent reflecting a reduction of the improvement in the trade 
deficit and slower business investment 
we think exports and investment will continue to be the 
strongest areas of the economy but they wont be as strong as they 
were in 1988 wyss said but a little slowdown is useful right 
now because the economy has really been growing too rapidly and 
needs to slow to a more sustainable pace 
in addition to powering growth in the new year business 
investment to replace aging plants and equipment helps to boost the 
us productivity rate a factor of growing importance as the 
country tries to meet rising international competition 
the 59 percent investment increase for all industries includes a 
35 percent planned boost for manufacturing companies and a 74 
percent rise for companies engaged in mining transportation and 
other nonmanufacturing areas 
in manufacturing the commerce department is projecting that 
spending will rise to an inflationadjusted 17015 billion 
following an even larger 127 percent increase in 1988 
the manufacturing increase includes a 22 percent rise in 
spending at plants making durable goods and a 47 percent increase 
at factories producing nondurable goods items not expected to last 
three years 
before adjusting for inflation the department projected that 
spending for 1989 would rise by 6 percent to 45596 billion after 
an anticipated increase of 104 percent this year

the president on wednesday ordered an 
investigation into reports that high government and military 
officials were involved in an automobile sales racket 
president robert mugabe appointed a judge and two private 
attorneys to investigate allegations the officials had profited from 
blackmarket sales of vehicles assembled in zimbabwe 
mugabe gave the investigators led by judge president wilson 
sandura the chief judge of zimbabwes highest court until march 
15 to complete the inquiry 
the public inquiry will focus on willowvale motor industries 
ltd a private plant that assembles most of the countrys motor 
vehicles 
news reports have alleged that willowvale illegally sold 
foreignmodel cars and trucks to buyers not registered as dealers 
who resold the vehicles at inflatd prices recent press reports have 
implicated 20 cabinet ministers senior bureaucrats and security 
officers in the illegal purchases 
private citizens normally have to wait years to buy a car in 
zimbabwe the demand for vehicles is five times greater than the 
locally assembled supply and imports are limited by shortages of 
foreign currency needed to pay for them 
cabinet ministers and members of parliament are entitled to buy 
one vehicle each from the willowvale plant at controlled government 
prices but are not allowed to resell them 
the chronicle newspaper has named vice president simon muzenda 
army cmdr rex nhongo and three senior members of mugabes cabinet 
as buyers of willowvale vehicles 
in letters to newspapers some citizens questioned why 
politicians with high salaries should have the privilege of owning 
cars when few zimbabweans can afford bicycles and most workers wait 
hours for buses because of a shortage of spare parts needed to 
repair them 
one letter asked why officials should own cars made at willowvale 
when the state already provides them free use of mercedesbenz 
vehicles 
defense minister enos nkala questioned by chronicle editor 
davison maruziva about a car he bought from willowvale threatened 
the journalist according to the newspaper 
nkala reportedly said he would send soldiers and police to detain 
maruziva and another editor unless they divulged the source of their 
information about his car purchase 
i am not the kind to play with nkala was quoted as saying

a class of police cadets whose first week in 
a grueling training program left one man dead and 13 hospitalized 
graduated wednesday its members commended as special because of 
what they endured 
your experience has done more to change the methods and 
approach to police training in this state than any other event since 
the establishment of the municipal training council in 1964 said 
peter w agnes jr interim executive director of the massachusetts 
criminal justice training council 
you are special because of what you have endured and you are 
special because of what you and tim shepard have inspired us to do 
for those who will come after you 
shepard 25 was among the cadets who fell ill in the first week 
of training that began sept 19 he died nov 3 at least 13 others 
were hospitalized with kidney and other problems resulting from 
exhaustion and dehydration 
shepard collapsed on the running track at the end of the first 
day of training and fell into a coma from heat stroke he later 
underwent a liver transplant 
the illnesses prompted investigations into the policetraining 
agency by the attorney general two legislative groups and a panel 
of police chiefs doctors and exercise experts assembled by gov 
michael s dukakis 
a report by attorney general james shannon called for an overhaul 
of the agency set up 24 years ago to oversee the uniform training of 
municipal police 
the report and shepards death prompted several firings and an 
inquest to determine whether criminal charges should be brought 
further the training program was revised to eliminate the socalled 
stress training 
the 45 graduates received their diplomas in an agawam junior high 
school auditorium filled with more than 600 friends relatives 
police chiefs and others 
the 12th class will always be labeled as the class that changed 
everything said david l pelletier president of the class

his home saturday and found him packing nayarit state spokesman 
francisco flores said in a telephone interview 
officials believe the security chief accepted 4300 to smuggle 
at least two 38caliber pistols and cartridges into venustiano 
carranza penitentiary in tepic capital of nayarit state when 
arrested he had more money than he normally would have with his 
salary flores said 
it was not clear whether he was accused of smuggling in the guns 
or of helping inmates or their visitors smuggle the arms in 
handling of the riot has caused a political flap since at least 
five inmates appear to have been killed after they surrendered to 
police commandos 
flores said martinez roman had been a suspect since the riot 
erupted dec 22 the security chief disappeared shortly before a 
group of inmates angry because they were denied christmas pardons 
for good behavior stormed the wardens office and took 19 hostages 
martinez roman appeared unusually nervous when he returned to 
the penitentiary in the midst of the riot on dec 23 flores said 
he did not appear at work the next day 
warden samuel alvarado was shot and killed when the riot began 
and inmates used the smuggled guns to seize additional arms from 
guards 
nayarit gov celso humberto delgado ramirez called in special 
commando units from mexico city 
one of the unit commanders juan armando duarte badillo was shot 
and killed when he tried to talk mutineers into surrendering 
then commandos stormed the prison administrative area 
state officials first said the commando units stormed the 
penitentiary twice the evening of dec 23 and that 19 prisoners died 
in two gunfights 
but after reports that a television videotape contradicted their 
account officials admitted there was only one assault 
on the videotape five prisoners are heard giving their names 
which appear on a list of dead released a few hours later a witness 
told the associated press that at least one other inmate listed as 
dead had surrendered 
on tuesday the federal chamber of deputies appointed a committee 
to investigate handling of the uprising 
flores identified the arrested guards as marcelo lopez estrada 
juan gonzalez muro camilio lozano ruiz andres castillo mansina 
agustin ortiz monroy and juan soria sanchez

the number of sea birds affected by an 
oil spill jumped from 1200 to 1500 wednesday and biologists 
scrubbing them made temporary ponds from water tanks to see if the 
waterfowl are regaining their buoyancy 
the scientists used dishwashing liquid and toothbrushes to remove 
the oil spilled thursday when a 300foot oil barge and its tug 
collided dumping about 70000 gallons 
an estimated 700 birds have died and the 300 birds that have 
been cleaned so far have only a 25 percent to 65 percent chance of 
survival experts said 
oil ruins the insulating effect of a birds feathers threatening 
death from cold birds can also become poisoned from ingesting oil 
while cleaning themselves 
cleaned birds were held at a makeshift clinic until they regain 
the natural oils that give them buoyancy 
the birds were forcefed smelt and placed in large tanks of 
water normally used to fight forest fires to determine if theyve 
regained their buoyancy said jani gilbert a spokeswoman for the 
washington department of ecology 
the birds are being found on 100 miles of beaches on the 
washington and oregon coasts said gilbert who estimated the number 
of waterfowl affected at 1500 
the species affected by the spill which continues to drift 
toward shore included common murres grebes scoters a couple of 
loons and one puffin 
after about an hour of scrubbing the birds are rinsed and then 
put in cages to allow their natural oils which are removed in the 
cleaning to return gilbert said

snow is such a rare commodity in the 
middle east that the rich arabic language only has one word with it 
thalj on wednesday however there was enough thalj to build a 
thaljman or hurl a thaljball 
a storm moving through the area over the past three days dropped 
up to three feet of snow in some areas and forecasters were 
predicting more on the way usually the middle east gets at most a 
light dusting of snow 
no weatherrelated casualties were reported but gusts of up to 
100 mph downed trees and power lines 
in jordan the narrow gorge leading into the ancient city of 
petra the countrys main tourist attraction had to be closed 
officials feared that melting snow would turn it into a raging flood 
course 
tourists looking for sun were awed by the famous pink cliffs 
dusted with white 
no one expected such a thing snow was not what the tourists 
came for said visitor jan bovirhuis of assen holland we found 
it extremely beautiful and nice to be in petra in the snow 
about 110 miles to the north children in the hilly capital of 
amman gleefully pelted pedestrians with snowballs in freezing 
temperatures and overcast skies 
people in the area treat any snowfall as a holiday decreed by 
god with families piling into cars to head into the hills for a 
closer look in lebanon many mountain roads were blocked leaving 
several villages isolated 
the lebanese long used to lack of government services after 13 
years of civil war were not perturbed by the abundant snow most 
houses in the mountains have a months supply of food and fuel on 
hand for the next time militia battles make the roads unpassable 
in israel snow that fell monday covered the picturesque artists 
colony of safed in northern israel mt hermon a ski spot in the 
annexed golan heights received about three feet of snow according 
to weather reports 
major roads between lebanon syria and jordan were kept open with 
bulldozers 
in lower areas the violent winds were accompanied by driving 
rain forcing people to stay indoors 
not every place saw the snow of course the saudi arabian red 
sea town of jezan was a balmy 90 degrees on wednesday 
but with another cold front on the way said ali abandah 
director of jordans national weather service the northern parts of 
the middle east may get a new round of snow for the new year

terrain 15 miles south of montgomery

friend political ally and infrequent fishing partner of bushs in 
1978 his fishing is so token he doesnt have a chance to get at 
it much

spurred by the death of a 17monthold boy in 
pennsylvania the government on wednesday issued a second recall for 
wooden accordionstyle enclosures used as playpens for small 
children 
the consumer product safety commission said nuline industries of 
suring wis is offering a 10 cash refund or 15 coupon for anyone 
who returns a wooden enclosure whether it was manufactured by 
nuline or another company 
the wooden corrals fold out into a round or ovalshaped 
enclosure that can be used as a playpen 
the agency said children between 10 months and 2 years of age are 
at the greatest risk because their heads can become stuck in the 
diamondshaped openings in the middle of the enclosure or the 
vshaped openings at the top 
the enclosures have not been manufactured or sold since may 1986 
when the federal agency issued the first recall for the product 
the agency decided to issue a second recall following the july 19 
death of a 17monthold boy in pennsylvania said ken giles 
spokesman for the consumer product safety commission 
people still have them in their homes and that became 
tragically apparent with this death giles said the wooden 
enclosures have been involved in at least 17 incidents resulting in 
four deaths the agency said 
the enclosures were manufactured by a number of companies some 
of which have either gone out of business or have been acquired by 
other companies giles said 
people may reach nuline by calling a tollfree number

a bomb destroyed the main office 
of the lutheran church in the salvadoran capital wednesday and 
damaged nearby homes but no one was injured a clergyman said 
the rev medardo gomez bishop of the lutheran congregation in el 
salvador and pastor of the targeted parish said the bomb was placed 
in the office at the rear of the church 
damage to the section for worship was mainly broken windows and 
homes across the street also had their windows blown out gomez 
said he estimated damage at 60000 
no group claimed responsibility for the predawn attack which 
occurred a day after publication of a communique by a newly formed 
death squad the group threatened leftists and those wellknown 
useful fools who directly or indirectly support the guerrillas 
el salvador is mired in a civil war pitting marxistled 
guerrillas against the usbacked government the lutheran church 
has provided significant aid to refugees whom the armed forces 
consider sympathetic to guerrillas 
because of the appearance of this new organization the death 
squad we speculate that it could be responsible but the church 
does not want to formally accuse anyone gomez said 
the pastor said members of the church which has about 10000 
members have received threats including death threats for six 
years he said he received an anonymous death threat friday 
the offices of the church were burglarized in october a bomb 
damaged a lutheranrun orphanage in august 1987 
because weve received so many blows we consider they are 
politically motivated because they accuse us as if we were doing 
political work which is not the case our work is the defense of 
life said gomez 
these actions wont intimidate us on the contrary they 
reinforce our resolve he said

a viral epidemic has wiped out up 
to 80 percent of the seals in the north sea and it will be at least 
a decade before the population is replenished a medical expert said 
wednesday 
about 7500 to 8000 seals have died in the epidemic which has 
been linked to the virus that causes distemper in dogs according to 
lenie t hart of the seal clinic in this northern dutch village 
the clinic is europes biggest hospital for seals 
before the epidemic broke out in april off the danish island of 
anholt there were 10000 seals in the north sea ms t hart told 
the associated press 
the epidemic gradually made its way south along the danish and 
west german north sea coast and eventually ended up in the wadden 
sea the shallow waters off the northern netherlands 
ms t hart said seals still are dying of the viral infection 
which undermines the animals immune system and exposes them to 
pneumonia or liver infection 
theyre not going to disappear from the north sea ms t 
hart said but she added its just going to take 10 to 14 years 
before the seal population is back where it was before that also 
means we cant afford another disaster 
animal health officials have developed a vaccine against the 
virus but they said its unfeasible to vaccinate all animals living 
in the wild only those seals taken into the clinic for care are 
being given the vaccine

the us forest services latest 50year 
analysis of the future of americas woodlands ignores the problems 
posed to forests by global warming the senate agriculture committee 
chairman said wednesday 
this is an inexplicable omission sen patrick leahy dvt 
said in a prepared statement accompanying release of his letter 
asking agriculture secretary richard lyng to order a rewriting of 
the analysis 
leahy said there is no mention of the socalled greenhouse effect 
in the draft analysis of the timber situation in the united 
states 19892040 the latest edition of a document updated every 
10 years by the forest service 
the analysis required by a 1972 law forms the basis for the 
services longrange planning and policies for the uses and 
development of national forests including estimates of future 
timber production 
scientists have told leahys committee and other congressional 
panels that forests both in this country and around the world are 
a major part of the global warming equation 
they have said that warming could occur at a pace so rapid that 
particular species of trees would be unable migrate fast enough into 
the cooler climate zones that they need for survival 
on the other side of the greenhouse coin trees are vital 
consumers of carbon dioxide which is a byproduct of fossil fuel use 
and which scientists say is collecting in the atmosphere and 
trapping increasing amounts of heat 
leahy said that in contrast to the forest service analysis a 
recent study by the environmental protection agency warns that 
climate change could profoundly affect american timber resources in 
the years ahead 
he told lyng that the epa study said that even under the 
mildest warming scenarios much of the southern half of the 
southeast would support only about half its current forests 
in contrast the forest service assessment assumes that 80 
percent of all economic opportunities for increasing financial 
returns from timber management will occur in the south leahy 
wrote to lyng 
there is a critical relationship between climate change and 
forests and it would be a serious mistake to release the 1989 
timber assessment to congress in its present form the chairman 
said 
merely revising the assessment however will not suffice he 
said climate change considerations must be integrated fully and 
without delay into policy analysis throughout the department 
leahy said 
the chairman said the departments headinthesand attitude is 
incredible in light of written testimony presented his committee 
dec 1 by orville bentley assistant agriculture secretary for 
research science and education 
in that testimony bentley said increased carbon concentrations 
in the atmosphere give usda valid reasons to be concerned about 
the potential effects of climate change in this nation as well as 
the world 
there was no immediate reaction from the forest service to 
leahys statements 
weve just received the letter said bob andrews of the 
services resources program and assessment division which prepared 
the analysis we will develop a response

city officials have rejected a proposal to 
name a street after the rev martin luther king jr triggering 
complaints from a black alderman that the decision was a step 
backward in race relations 
the 42 vote tuesday night came after about 10 people requested 
that pine street a residential and commercial street that runs 
through the downtown area of this mississippi river city be named 
after the slain civil rights leader 
mayor david armstrong who was among the supporters of the change 
but does not vote on the board said the city needed to show unity 
between blacks and whites 
aldermen opposing the step said that tax rolls and property deeds 
would have to be changed and businesses on the street would be 
inconvenienced 
harden the only black member of the sixmember board said prior 
to the vote that other members were not interested in moving 
natchez forward were going to have problems in natchez for the 
next three or four years 
alderman freddie biglane who voted against the name change said 
he felt threatened that those seeking the name change were promoting 
a boycott if they failed to get their way 
at tuesdays meeting the citizens group presented a report that 
said the businessmen would not oppose the change 
we went through something last year i hope never happens again 
and i think we made a lot of strides forward in the town to do some 
good things armstrong said 
the mayor was referring to a boycott of whiteowned businesses by 
blacks over alleged inequities in the schools the boycott wound 
down early this year and died out after the county superintendent 
was replaced during the summer

top state officials wednesday threatened to 
withdraw support for the seabrook nuclear plant if its lead owner 
tries to sidestep state law and begin charging its 340000 
ratepayers for the stalled reactor 
public service company of new hampshire filed a bankruptcy 
reorganization plan tuesday that would make it federally regulated 
and no longer subject to a state law prohibiting utilities from 
charging for plants before they operate commercially 
the utility said it seeks rate increases of 30 percent to 40 
percent during the next several years to cover its 36 percent stake 
in seabrook which has been unable to obtain a license because of 
emergency evacuation obstacles 
govelect judd gregg said the reorganization plan amounts to 
savaging ratepayers to protect the speculators and creditors 
he and legislative leaders said they will try to establish a 
public power authority that could take over the utility if it 
pursues the plan 
gregg also said that if rate negotiations between the state the 
utility and its creditors are fruitless and public service tries to 
evade state regulation the state would reconsider its support for 
seabrook 
in my opinion everything is on the table gregg said 
even gov john sununu who has championed seabrook in his six 
years in office raised that possibility 
sununu said the state ought not to exclude any alternative in 
fighting the reorganization plan 
asked whether that means he may be willing to drop support for 
seabrook sununu said i think it means having in place the 
capacity to bring that particular tool to the table as one of the 
bargaining chips 
public service spokesman nicholas ashooh replied we just hope 
the state would not hold new hampshire electric consumers hostage 
during these negotiations we need that seabrook power and the 
state knows it 
the most productive thing is to put these threats aside and 
reach an agreement ashooh said 
public service sought protection from its creditors on jan 28 
because of more than 2 billion in seabrook debt 
the reorganization proposal met with opposition not only from 
state officials and consumers groups but from public service 
creditors as well the utiltys stock and bond prices took a beating 
after the plan was disclosed 
public servicess plan is subject to approval by the various 
parties involved and by the bankruptcy court 
public service has two months before other parties in the 
reorganization may offer competing plans the utility described its 
plan as an opening position for a new round of talks with its 
creditors and the state 
the states lead negotiator larry smukler a senior assistant 
attorney general said wednesday no talks are scheduled but the 
state is willing to negotiatate with public service when theyre 
willing to get serious

a senior aide to president hosni mubarak 
charged on wednesday that israel is not serious in its efforts to 
resolve the palestinian issue and ruled out a visit by mubarak to 
israel for the time being 
osama elbaz head of mubaraks political office and an 
undersecretary at the foreign ministry dismissed israels latest 
peace proposals as gimmicks and urged the new american 
administration to pressure the jewish state to take a more flexible 
position toward peace talks 
speculation of a mubarak visit boomed after he offered in two 
interviews to go to israel if that would lead to resolution of the 
palestinian issue 
elbaz said while egypt had no objections inhibitions 
about holding contacts with israel or any other party in the 
interest of peace the government did not believe in ceremonial 
meetings 
at this point it is not in the interest of parties to have a 
summit meeting just to argue a point here or there this is being 
done through regular channels elbaz told a news conference 
for a meeting between the president and the israeli prime 
minister or any other highranking israeli official to take place 
and become fruitful we must witness before holding the meeting the 
realization of meaningful and tangible progress on the road to 
peace 
in other mideast developments wednesday 
morris abram outgoing president of the prestigious conference 
of presidents of major american jewish organizations said in 
jerusalem that plo leader yasser arafat should prove his interest in 
peace by ordering a halt to the yearlong palestinian uprising in the 
occupied territories 
president reagan sent a letter to premier yitzhak shamir of 
israel reiterating the unambiguous commitment of the united 
states to israels security a shamir spokesman said israel radio 
said the letter stressed that the us decision this month to open a 
dialogue with the palestine liberation organization did not mean 
acceptance of the idea of an independent palestinian state 
the plo is prepared to attend a conference in new york or 
washington on terrorism with israel also taking part according to 
statements published in the newspaper alyawm in riyadh saudi 
arabia saeed kamal plo representative in egypt was quoted as 
saying such a conference would help clear the plos name it was not 
clear if his proposal had official plo backing 
israel rejects holding talks with the plo which it considers a 
terrorist organization it also opposes an international peace 
conference on the mideast 
elbaz said israel is presenting counterproposals that in 
our opinion are not serious proposals for peace but rather gimmicks 
that are intended to direct world attention from the real issues in 
order to give the false impression that there is in effect a new 
israeli position 
he said reports from israel spoke of a new peace initiative 
proposed by shamir which revolved around autonomy for palestinians 
instead of an independent state 
elbaz said the formula of autonomy has been superseded and 
surpassed by events and by israeli actions and policies he also 
said there is no point in holding elections in the west bank and 
gaza strip to set up a body to represent the palestinians when 
there is in fact a body which represents palestinians it would 
be a farce 
shamir said sunday that israel would work toward an agreement 
with egypt and jordan on selfrule for palestinians in the west bank 
and gaza captured in the 1967 middle east war he said if agreement 
were reached he would allow free elections for an adminstrative 
council to run palestinian affairs in the territories 
egypt in 1979 became the only arab state to sign a peace treaty 
with israel egypt played a major role in persuading the plo to 
adopt a more moderate stance to get the peace process moving 
plo chairman yasser arafats recognition of israels right to 
exist and his renounciation of terrorism this month prompted 
washington to reverse a 13year policy and hold official contacts 
with the organization 
elbaz lauded the us decision 
he said egypt expected the bush administration to take a positive 
role in preparations for an international peace conference to be 
held under un auspices

the interior department has pledged to keep 
strip mining out of national parks and other protected federal areas 
but proposed regulations aimed at ending a longstanding dispute 
might allow some underground mining 
department officials pointing to a policy statement released 
tuesday said wednesday that if anyone sought to conduct surface 
coal mining in protected areas the interior secretary would use 
available authority to block the plans by obtaining the mining 
rights provided funds could be obtained from congress 
the policy statement which appeared in the federal register with 
draft regulations was silent on underground mining 
the draft regulations are an attempt by the department to end a 
controversy over the definition of valid existing rights for 
mining in areas now under federal protection 
an undated environmental impact statement related to the issue 
said that under the proposed regulations most owners of private 
coal rights in protected areas would be able to establish valid 
existing rights for underground mining and the prohibitions on 
mining in protected areas would not apply to them 
it was not immediately clear how much park and other protected 
land might be subject to mining officials said the principal area 
affected is the new river gorge area of west virginia where 
underground mines operated years ago and where private owners today 
claim mining rights 
the environmental statement said 315545 acres of affected 
federal land lies over coal of which 87383 acres is subject to 
52181 potential claims of that total there were 4033 potential 
private mining claims to coal lying beneath 9397 acres of national 
park system properties and wildlife refuges 
congress in 1977 prohibited surface coal mining on lands public 
or private within the boundaries of national parks and other lands 
of the national park service wildlife refuges national trails 
wilderness areas national recreation areas wild and scenic rivers 
and in certain cases national forests 
the prohibition did not apply to existing mines or to holders of 
valid existing rights the law did not define valid existing 
rights and the department has spent more than 11 years in and out 
of court trying to do so 
the latest attempt proposed two definitions to be interpreted 
according to state law the department asked for comment on the 
proposals during the next 70 days 
one definition would require anyone wishing to exercise a valid 
existing right to have applied for all necessary mining permits 
from state authorities in 1977 that would effectively block 
virtually all attempts to mine in protected areas officials said 
such an interpretation is now followed in all states but west 
virginia and illinois in those states current standards permit 
mining if a prohibition in individual cases would amount to taking 
property for which compensation would have to be paid 
a similar definition was used nationwide before 1980 the 
department required a claimant to have obtained all the necessary 
permits but federal courts said the standard was too strict and 
that claimants should have to show only that they applied by the 
aug 3 1977 cutoff date 
the alternative definition would require only that the miner own 
the coal this proposal leaves to state law the question of whether 
the owner of the coal may disturb the surface to get at it if 
somebody else owns the surface an important question in kentucky 
where most coal has been owned in such split estates and the law 
is currently unsettled 
under this option most owners could mine by underground methods 
and some might be able to use surface methods the environmental 
statement said

morris abram leader of a prestigious american 
jewish organization demanded wednesday that plo leader yasser 
arafat prove his interest in peace by ordering a halt to the 
palestinian uprising 
one way or another the violence must cease on the west bank as 
a prelude to any kind of peace process abram outgoing president 
of the conference of presidents of major american jewish 
organizations told a news conference 
palestinians launched their intefadeh arabic for uprising in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip on dec 8 1987 to protest 20 
years of israeli rule since the rebellion began 337 palestinians 
and 14 israelis have been killed 
abram said arafat must prove by deeds his words in geneva 
this month renouncing terrorism and calling for a comprehensive 
settlement among all parties to the arabisraeli conflict including 
in the occupied territories 
now he may do that by of course calling for a repeal of 
the covenant morris said in a reference to the charter of the 
palestine liberation organization which calls for elimination of 
israel 
but he arafat also should be expected as the representative 
of his people to call off the violence the intefadeh 
abram referred to the plo as a terrorist organization and 
said he did not think it would change enough for israel ever to open 
peace talks with it 
seymour reich president of bnai brith international who is to 
replace abram as conference president on jan 1 told reporters the 
change in us administrations will give israel a needed breathing 
spell to develop its own peace initiative 
both abram and reich said they were given no clues in their talks 
with prime minister yitzhak shamir and other israeli officials on 
the content of a new initiative being formulated by shamir 
reich 55 has been international president of bnai brith since 
1986 a harvard law school graduate he is a senior attorney at the 
dreyer and traub law firm in new york he lives with his family in

semtex suspected as the material used to 
destroy pan am flight 103 is an odorless orangecolored plastic 
explosive and the least detectable known to terrorism experts 
the substance is manufactured by the eastern bohemian works a 
stateowned arms factory in czechoslovakia terrorism experts as 
well as state department officials say syria and libya have 
obtained semtex from czechoslovakia and passed it on to surrogate 
terrorist groups 
british authorities said wednesday that the residue of explosives 
recovered from the debris of the boeing 747 jumbo jet in scotland 
was consistent with the use of a high performance plastic 
explosive speculation focused on semtex 
the united states also manufactures plastic explosives going 
back to a substance known as c3 at the end of world war ii and a 
more updated version called c4 other arms producing countries also 
make plastic explosives 
but semtex is the only such substance to have defied all 
detection attempts by bombsniffing dogs xray machines and other 
devices terrorism experts say it also has the advantage of being 
stable meaning it does not go off in uncontrolled circumstances 
it can be placed in a suitcase and appear as a dense mass on an 
xray operators screen it also can be shaped to resemble other 
innocentlooking objects electronic detonators can be cloaked in

a bomb made of plastic explosives blew 
pan am flight 103 out of the sky over scotland killing its 259 
passengers and crew investigators said wednesday 
with suspicions focusing on middle east and iranian terrorists 
scotland yard and the fbi joined forces in a criminal inquiry of 
international dimensions said john boyd the lockerbie areas 
chief constable 
in a dramatic announcement in lockerbie the village that bore 
the brunt of the jumbo jets falling wreckage investigators 
reported conclusive evidence of a detonating high explosive 
aboard the jet 
the announcement capped a week of painstaking investigation of 
wreckage baggage bodies and cockpit recorders from the dec 21 
crash of the boeing 747 
the us government offered a reward of up to 500000 for 
information leading to the prosecution of anyone who caused the 
crash 
britains department of transport announced wednesday night it 
had ordered us airlines using british airports to immediately 
increase security in particular in relation to hold baggage 
the department said it consulted with the federal aviation 
administration and that the faa is also considering further 
security requirements for us airlines worldwide a spokesman 
refused to elaborate 
the evidence was found in two parts of a luggage pallet the 
metal rack where baggage is stored said michael charles head of 
the governments air accidents investigation branch 
the explosives residues recovered from the debris have been 
positively identified and are consistent with the use of a high 
performance plastic explosive charles said in a statement 
flight 103 left londons heathrow airport for new york and a 
preliminary conclusion was the explosion occurred soon after the 
jet crossed the scottish border at 31000 feet the statement said 
it contained no clue as to who planted the bomb in which section 
of the plane it went off or how and where it was smuggled aboard 
the planes image on ground radar broke up at 719 pm 54 
minutes after takeoff and it plummeted earthward spewing bodies 
and hunks of flaming wreckage into lockerbie and the countryside in 
a 15mile radius 
the calamity struck so swiftly the cockpit couldnt even 
transmit a distress signal 
charles who refused to answer questions said items of wreckage 
were to undergo lengthy chemical and metallurgical forensic 
examinations 
much investigative work remains to be done to establish the 
nature of the explosive device what it was contained in its 
location in the aircraft and the sequence of events immediately 
following its detonation charles said 
paul wilkinson a researcher on terrorism at aberdeen university 
said in an interview the bomb was most likely planted in the forward 
hold blowing away the nose section 
michael yardley a british expert on terrorism speculated the 
bomb contained semtex a czechoslovakmade highperformance 
explosive british authorities say has come into libyan hands 
capt john guntrip of britains guild of air pilots said plastic 
explosive is malleable and can be molded into innocent shapes to 
beat security xrays 
you can make it as a model of an ivory head or almost anything 
you can wish so that if almost any trace was seen on a tv picture

souvenir he told itn 
still under investigation are three groups who callers said were 
responsible they were identified by l paul bremer who heads the 
state departments office of counterterrorism as the guardians of 
islamic revolution the islamic jihad and a group of protestant 
extremists whose name he did not have 
ian geldard research director at the londonbased institute for 
the study of terrorism speculated the bomb was planted by 
palestinian extremists who oppose the palestine liberation 
organizations recent peace overtures which include recognition of 
israel 
among the groups he mentioned were the abu nidal group the may 
15th organization whose bomb killed four people in a twa jet in 
1986 and ahmed jibrils popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command whose bombing of a swissair flight in 
1970 made it the first terrorist outfit to blow up an airliner in 
flight 
geldard said a unit of the general command captured in west 
germany recently possessed bombs capable of being used on airliners 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt as a boeing 727 and flew to 
heathrow where it switched to a boeing 747 west german police are 
investigating whether the bomb was smuggled aboard in frankfurt 
most of the passengers boarded in london many laden with

the reagan administration said wednesday it was 
adopting tougher airport security measures and had committed the fbi 
to help british authorities find who placed a bomb aboard the pan am 
jumbo jet that crashed last week in scotland killing about 270 
people 
at the same time us officials acknowledged that a week after 
the disaster they had no hard leads to indicate who put the 
explosive device aboard new yorkbound flight 103 
we cannot at this stage put more suspicion on one group or 
another said l paul bremer the state departments chief of 
counterterrorism weve got to follow all the leads weve got 
a senior us official said these covered a wide range of 
potential suspects including such radical palestinians as the 
prosyrian popular front for the liberation of palestine general 
command and the prolibyan abu nidal group as well as the guardians 
of islamic revolution an iranian organization 
but the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said us 
and british investigators had not determined what kind of bomb 
caused the crash 
that information is considered critical because terrorist groups 
tend to use specific bombing methods and yet the official said 
modus operandi are not conclusive because technology is 
transferable 
the popular front for the liberation of palestine general 
command is based in syria and led by ahmed jibril a former captain 
of the syrian army it is opposed to yasser arafats palestine 
liberation organization 
the abu nidal group known also as the al fatah revolutionary 
council was implicated in the 1985 airport bombings in rome and 
vienna its ties to libya contributed to the reagan administrations 
decision to bomb tripoli libya in 1986 
the guardians of islamic revolution is a prokhomeini group 
there is no hard evidence said a diplomatic source who 
declined to be identified but if you had to make a guess the 
jibril group would be the logical one 
bremer meanwhile told the associated press that what we know 
is that there was a bomb on the plane we dont know who put it 
there or why the suspicion is that it was a terrorist act but it 
also could be an act of criminal sabotage 
he said among the tasks confronting investigators was to find out 
how the bomb got aboard flight 103 where it was placed and what it 
was made of we ought to have a very open mind he said we 
shouldnt narrow our field of inquiry until we get more evidence or 
intelligence that leads us in a certain direction so we have to 
look at all groups there isnt any prime suspect 
both president reagan and presidentelect bush were advised of 
the british governments conclusion that the boeing 747 was bombed 
reagan was spending the holidays in los angeles and bush was 
hunting quail in texas 
the white house pledged all available resources deputy press 
secretary leslye arsht said we agree with the results of their 
the british investigation 
the us government offered a reward of up to 500000 last week 
for information leading to the prosecution of any terrorist or 
saboteur who caused the crash which killed all 259 passengers and 
crew members and at least 11 residents of lockerbie scotland where 
wreckage of the disintegrated jetliner fell 
the federal aviation administration meanwhile said it is 
reviewing security measures taken by us airlines abroad and is 
planning more stringent security requirements which will afford 
additional protection to us air carriers and the traveling 
public 
the faa in a statement did not cite specific changes that are 
being planned agency spokesman fred farrar said faa security 
experts are still working out details of the new requirements some 
of which probably will not be made public 
much of the focus is expected to be on tightening passenger 
screening and inspection of carryon luggage and taking additional 
precautions to match all baggage with boarding passengers 
the incident points up the need for the international community 
to adopt even more stringent air security measures said state 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
fbi director william b sessions said at a news conference that 
his agency had no specific suspects and is investigating alternative 
possibilities that the bomb was placed by terrorists or by criminals 
targeting a specific passenger 
were looking at every single aspect sessions said you 
must presume its either terrorist or criminal 
mrs oakley said we are doing everything possible and using 
all available resources and sources to find out who did it a 
vigorous investigation is under way to determine how the explosives 
were introduced into the airplane 
she said the united states had agreed with finnish police in 
ruling out any connection between the crash and a telephone call to 
the us embassy in helsinki earlier in the month 
the caller said a pan am plane from frankfurt west germany 
would be bombed by the abu nidal group of palestinian extremists 
implicated in airport bombings in 1985 in rome and vienna flight 
103 originated in frankfurt with a change of planes in london 
but george carver a terrorism expert with the center for 
strategic and international studies a washington think tank said 
it would be premature to rule out any terrorist group as a suspect 
he said the caller to the helsinki may not be involved but might 
have heard reliable information since his tip preceded the bombing 
carver said he had no firsthand knowledge of the investigation 
but that a powerful plastic bomb such as that the british government 
said was used could be as small as one foot in length and one or two 
inches wide and could easily be slipped inside a suitcase 
still under investigation are three groups who callers after the 
crash said were responsible for the bombing they were identified 
last week by bremer as the guardians of islamic revolution the 
islamic jihad and an ulster defense group 
but mrs oakley stressed there was no prime suspect and in a 
statement read to reporters after british authorities concluded an 
explosive device caused the crash she said the fbi was working 
closely with the faa in a search for further clues at the crash 
site 
while the british government has primary responsibility for the 
investigation mrs oakley said under us law the fbi also has 
a responsibility to investigate the incident 
sessions said the criminal end of the fbi investigation involves 
talking to relatives associates and employers of occupants of the 
plane in an effort to find out whether anyone had any grudges 
against passengers or crew members 
sessions said he had been told that the explosive used to bomb 
the plane was like semtex described by another fbi official as 
a military plastic explosive used by sovietbloc nations but 
sessions stressed that the type of explosive has not been positively 
identified 
james ronay who heads the fbis explosives unit said semtex 
is available to various criminal group and it has been used in 
other incidents he did not specify those incidents

a presidential commission put the final touches 
wednesday on a plan to close many of the nations military bases 
perhaps two dozen or more and braced for local cries of anguish 
over the jobs and federal dollars at stake 
i expect were going to be pretty unpopular in some areas after 
this comes out said jack edwards the former republican 
congressman from alabama who is cochairman of the 12member panel 
with former sen abraham ribicoff dconn 
edwards panel will present its report thursday morning to deputy 
defense secretary william h taft iv and the closely guarded 
document will then be made public 
weve considered a lot of factors but some people will be 
unhappy said edwards in a recent interview 
the panel and its 40member staff has spent the past seven months 
scrutinizing the nations 3800 military installations but has 
generally focused its attention on the 870 largest bases according 
to jim abbee a spokesman for the commission 
shutting down unneeded bases is expected to save billions of 
dollars a year pentagon estimates have ranged as high as 5 billion 
annually but rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed 
services committee said i think 2 billion a year is a more 
realistic figure 
edwards said his panel had no specific targets either in number 
of bases to be closed or in dollars saved 
we didnt start out with targets like that we dont have a 
goal in terms of numbers of bases closed or dollars he said 
aspin has estimated that two dozen or more bases may be closed 
edwards refused to confirm that figure 
a republican california congressman rep jerry lewis said he 
had been told by sources that the commission will recommend the 
closing of george air force base locted in the desert 70 miles 
northeast of los angeles and consolidation of air operations at the 
states march and norton bases included in the plan according to 
lewis was a recommendation that the operations of the 63rd military 
airlift wing be shifted from norton in san bernardino to march 
which is near riverside 
no major installations have been closed since 1977 chiefly 
because of the thicket of congressional rules and regulations 
enacted to keep bases open 
release of the panels report is the biggest step yet in the 
complicated process set up by congress to both close unneeded bases 
and remove congressmen from the political heat that follows the lost 
jobs 
the edwards panel was approved in the waning days of the 100th 
congress as a political compromise by legislators who wanted to 
reduce the federal budget deficit and also avoid constituent 
criticism 
after receiving the report defense secretary frank c carlucci 
will have until jan 15 five days before he leaves office to 
accept or reject its findings carlucci must say yes or no to the 
entire report and wont be allowed to pick or choose among bases 
carlucci is expected to approve the panels recommendations 
which would send the issue back to capitol hill congress will have 
until next spring to act but it can only block the closings if both 
the house and senate pass disapproval resolutions 
that resolution could be vetoed by george bush meaning that the 
disapproval resolution would effectively have to pass each chamber 
by a twothirds vote the margin required to overturn a presidential 
veto 
the panel has been lobbied heavily by worried legislators for 
example earlier this month rep glenn english dokla delivered 
more than 13000 letters from enid okla urging that vance air 
force base be kept open 
but a closed base doesnt have to mean economic disaster 
according to the business executives for national security a 
private group which studies national security issues 
the secret to recovering from a base closing is to start early 
start fast and keep at it said stanley a weiss chairman of the 
group weiss was the founder of american minerals inc 
although its natural for a community to grieve when it loses a 
major employer it is critical to move quickly to develop a diverse 
business base to replace the military presence he said

attorneys for oliver north on wednesday sought 
a stay of a court order requiring them to give prosecutors an 
outline of possible defense testimony for norths trial in the 
irancontra affair 
us district judge gerhard a gesell on friday had ruled that 
independent prosecutor lawrence e walsh must be given a 162page 
outline of possible testimony in the trial of the former national 
security council aide 
gesell had said the material must be turned over by jan 3 
norths attorneys asked gesell on wednesday to stay the order 
until an appeal or other court action can be filed 
norths lawyers have argued that turning over the outline would 
reveal their trial strategy and violate norths constitutional 
rights 
judy smith a spokeswoman in walshs office said no court 
hearing had yet been scheduled and her office had no immediate 
response to the motion 
gesell last week set a jan 31 trial date for north who is 
charged with conspiring with former national security adviser john 
poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj 
gen richard secord to illegally divert more than 12 million in 
usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
the four are to be tried separately with norths trial scheduled

the government ordered all us airlines using 
british airports to tighten security immediately wednesday night 
especially in handling baggage stored in the luggage compartments of 
aircraft 
the department of transport said the directive was made after 
consultation with the us federal aviation administration which it 
said was also considering further security requirements for us 
airlines worldwide 
its decision came hours after investigators announced a bomb made 
of powerful plastic explosives caused the dec 21 crash of pan am 
flight 103 over the scottish town of lockerbie killing all 259 
people on board the jumbo jet and 11 on the ground 
officials said evidence of the explosion was found in wreckage 
from the boeing 747s cargo hold 
a brief department of transport statement said we have 
reviewed the security arrangements for flights by us carriers in 
the light of this incident in consultation with the faa and are 
immediately directing us airlines to take additional measures in 
britain in particular in relation to hold baggage 
a spokesman who by custom was not identified refused to 
elaborate or give any details on the additional security measures it 
wants taken 
the announcement followed calls by british lawmakers and aviation 
experts for increased security following the crash the worst 
aviation disaster in british history 
the question that now has to be asked is how and where did a 
bomb get on board said david wilshire an aviation expert and 
lawmaker from prime minister margaret thatchers governing 
conservative party 
wilshire said there were three sources of passengers on the 
flight those who got on at frankfurt where the flight originated 
those who joined at heathrow airport and 12 in transit from other 
flights 
we are not therefore just talking about heathrow or 
frankfurt he said 
the luggage of the 12 transit passengers went through the 
heathrow security system but luggage belonging to the frankfurt 
passengers did not although it was transferred under supervision of 
pan am guards he said 
opposition lawmakers have protested angrily that the department 
of transport never informed british airports or travelers about a 
us warning of a terrorist threat to bomb a pan am airliner on the 
frankfurtnew york route in december 
the government said that after receiving the threat it had 
reviewed security for us flights at british airports which 
already is higher than for some other destinations and decided it 
was adequate 
john prescott the opposition labor partys transport spokesman 
said he had written to mrs thatcher demanding an independent 
investigation into the department of transports handling of airport 
security which he called inadequate and the us government 
warning which he claimed the department had largely ignored

a policy on police chases was under review 
at the time of the citys third fatal hotpursuit crash this month 
a fiery accident that killed five family members the police chief 
said wednesday 
the chase tuesday night ended when a car fleeing from police at 
80 mph ran a red light and crashed into another car 
police chief dwight joseph said the review came at the request of 
city councilwoman cynthia cecil lazarus and was prompted by the 
deaths of two people in hotpursuit crashes earlier in december 
mrs lazarus was reported to be out of town wednesday and 
unavailable for comment 
in tuesdays accident police began chasing the car seconds 
before the crash when officers spotted the vehicle speeding the 
second car was cut in two and exploded and its five occupants 
burned to death police said 
in the earlier accidents a stolen car being chased by police ran 
a red light and hit another car killing one of its occupants and a 
car being chased for traffic violations hit two utilty poles 
killing a passenger 
joseph said the departments crash policy redrafted two years 
ago was followed in all three chases this month 
the new policy recommended limiting the number of police cars 
involved in a chase to two unless a supervisor orders more 
prohibiting officers from engaging in pursuits when a suspect or 
civilian is in their car and allowing only marked cars with lights 
and sirens to participate in chases 
the victims were tentatively identified wednesday as earl 
maynard 39 his wife connie maynard 37 their son marty maynard 
10 connies mother edna cox 64 and ms coxs foster son david 
morris 26 said officer paul hillenbrand the driver of the 
speeding car emmett gabriel 30 was listed in poor condition 
wednesday at grant medical center with head arm and chest injuries 
no charges were immediately filed 
each chase is different and no policy can be written to cover 
every possibility said lt john carruthers who teaches a class on 
hot pursuit and use of force 
the decision of whether to conduct a highspeed chase often must 
be made in a split second and an officer must be both calm and 
trained in weighing the value of an arrest against the danging carruthers 
said 
officers are trained to use slow pursuit techniques that 
allow them to capitalize on the suspects driving mistakes napd 
director rocky coltellaro said in a telephone interview 
joseph said officers also are taught to use slack pursuit 
if police slow down violators often do so as well 
pursuits have been an issue for some time carruthers said 
theyve been identified as a highliability area for policing and 
any time youve had a series of incidents it focuses that much more 
attention

many disabled veterans may be over or 
undercompensated for their injuries because the veterans 
administration is using outdated medical data a congressional study 
reported wednesday 
the use of outdated medical standards could mean the difference 
of hundreds of dollars each month to some veterans the general 
accounting office said in recommending that the va perform a 
comprehensive review of its standards 
the va paid about 143 billion in disability benefits to about 
38 million veterans and their survivors in 1987 said the gao the 
investigative branch of congress 
the various parts of the disability rating schedule have been 
updated individually but there has been no comprehensive look at 
the schedule since 1945 
as a result the report said some medical conditions are not 
listed in the schedule which means a va rating specialist must use 
his or her own judgment to classify the disability 
va cannot ensure that veterans are given accurate and uniform 
disability ratings because the rating schedule has not been adjusted 
to incorporate the results of many recent medical advances the 
study said 
it is inherently difficult to achieve uniform and accurate 
administration of this type of program outofdate rating schedules 
make it almost impossible according to the rent to 56 of the 58 va 
regional offices to be classified 
in one case a veteran with hypertensive heart disease was 
assigned five different ratings ranging from 10 percent disability 
to 100 percent twentyfive rating boards gave him a 30 percent 
disability or 202 per month in benefits and 21 boards gave him 60 
percent or 516 in benefits 
in another case a veteran with post traumatic stress disorder 
was rated from zero to 70 percent disabled by the various boards 
which would have meant anywhere from no benefits to 410 a month 
the report said 
in a gao survey of 383 va rating specialists 61 percent said it 
was somewhat likely or very likely that in rating mental 
disorders they could reach two or more rating percentages with the 
same medical evidence 
fiftyone percent said the same situation could occur in rating 
neurological and convulsive disorders and for all types of illness 
22 percent said it was likely to reach more than one conclusion with 
the same medical evidence

prime minister noboru takeshita was jolted by a new 
setback in japans stockprofiteering scandal hours after he 
promised reform measures in a nationally televised news conference 
wednesday 
takeshita under growing attack over the scandal pledged to give 
top priority to changes in fundraising methods by politicians and 
in the nations election system 
but early thursday his newly appointed justice minister 
76yearold takashi hasegawa reversed a statement he made two days 
earlier and admitted that his individual campaign organization 
received funds from recruit co the informationemployment 
conglomerate at the center of the storm 
the development was expected to foil takeshitas plans to revive 
public support with his reshuffle on tuesday of a cabinet tainted by 
the scandal 
takeshita told the news conference solving the recruit 
incident is a current problem but i believe that prosecution 
officials will take suitable action 
despite a major drop in support indicated by public opinion 
polls he ruled out any plans to dissolve the diet japans 
parliament and call an election for both houses next summer when 
an upper house election is scheduled 
hasegawa charged with overseeing the scandal investigation told 
reporters his political support organization received about 46000 
in donations over the past 12 years from hiromasa ezoe founder and 
former chairman of recruit 
only tuesday hasegawa said after his cabinet appointment i 
have nothing to do with recruit and thats why i can appear before 
you 
takeshita said wednesday he chose hasegawa because he headed a 
parliamentary ethics committee and was the most trustworthy 
both men belong to the governing liberal democratic party 
in the scandal influential politicians and businessmen were 
offered bargainpriced unlisted shares in recruitcosmos a real 
estate company and a recruit subsidiary and profited after the 
shares were put up for public sale 
after the scandal widened and liberal democrats pushed a 
controversial tax reform package through parliament a poll this 
month by the newspaper mainichi shimbun indicated the takeshita 
governments approval rating tumbling to 18 percent from 30 percent 
when he took office in november 1987 
media commentaries said takeshita failed to address the political 
ethics issue 
basically each politician including myself must always take 
into account an ethical platform takeshita said but it is 
first necessary to create the environment to make this possible 
he said formation tuesday of a new party committee on ethics was 
one step toward creating that environment 
the group headed by former cabinet secretary masaharu gotoda 
will be asked to review the law allowing politicians to collect 
taxfree political funds it also will draw up short and 
mediumrange goals for overhauling the election system takeshita 
said 
he called for a correction in the imbalance of electoral seats 
since a 1950s population explosion in the cities rural districts 
a stronghold of the governing party have had disproportionately 
large representation in the diet 
a parliamentary political reform committee and another group 
answering to the prime minister also will join in mapping goals to 
mark the 100th anniversary of the election system in july 1990 
takeshita said 
he said the dormant election system council consisting of 
officials academics and other experts will be resurrected so the 
government the liberal democratic party and the diet can form one 
body and begin laying the foundation for political reform as soon 
as possible in the new year 
meanwhile hasegawa was to lead an investigation of corruption in 
government centered around the recruit scandal 
takeshita himself had an aide who profited in the recruit 
transactions but the prime minister has denied any personal 
involvement 
the transactions are not illegal but they are regarded as 
unethical opposition parties charge that political favors were 
granted in exchange

anger vengeance and a desire to prevent similar deaths in the 
future were among feelings expressed wednesday by some family 
members of the 259 people killed when a bomb exploded on pan am 
flight 103 
one man who lost his son wanted revenge against whoever is 
responsible for the dec 21 crash of the boeing 747 over lockerbie 
scotland and others just wanted a way to rationalize what happened 
to their loved ones 
authorities in lockerbie the village that bore the brunt of the 
jumbo jets falling wreckage announced wednesday conclusive 
evidence of a detonating high explosive aboard the jetliner 
after the crash it emerged that us authorities had been warned 
of a terrorist threat to bomb a pan am airliner on the frankfurtnew 
york route in december flight 103 originated in frankfurt west 
germany 
i feel that every passenger on that plane should have been 
given the same warning as diplomats said susan cohen whose 
daughter theodora 20 was among 35 syracuse university students 
killed they know how to differentiate between safe and real 
threats 
in those cases where its serious security should be heavy 
mrs cohen said every piece of luggage should be inspected by 
hand why didnt they ill tell you why money 
we cannot allow greed to endanger the lives of american 
citizens my baby will never come back i will fight with every 
breath to see this never happens to another mother she said 
the father of syracuse university student karen hunt 20 also 
called for stricter security measures 
we just hope that somehow someone whether its our 
government working with other governments something has to be done 
to protect people hunt said innocent people should at least be 
given the opportunity to avoid additional threats to their 
security 
ww coursey of faulkville ga whose son us army sgt w 
larry coursey was on the flight said the news didnt surprise me 
one bit i had my feelings about it all the time 
coursey said whatever country or party is determined to be 
responsible for the bombing should be wiped out 
we should not be going over there and pat them on the back 
just put a stop to it he said it dont take but about once or 
twice like that before you dont find this kind of mess happening i 
hate to be hardnosed about it but thats the way i feel 
in melrose mass len colasanti father of 20yearold gary 
colasanti another syracuse university student heard the news while 
preparing for his sons funeral 
if it were an act of god it would be easier for us to accept 
colasanti said the fact that it was a terrorist act makes it much 
more difficult to accept garys loss 
in st louis park minn robert rappaport a cousin of victim 
judith ellen bernstein said he was not surprised authorities had 
determined a bomb was planted on the plane 
things that are going on in the world today are so complicated 
that nothing makes sense to me anymore he said 
rappaport said that when an iranian jet was shot down last 
summer he thought how horrible you never think that it could 
touch you and it did 
that sort of thing is more than we can deal with added sally 
pitt of south hadley mass mother of victim james pitt 24

millionplus libel lawsuit filed by engelbert humperdinck is 
standing behind an article stating his daughters mother fears the 
entertainer is battling the aids virus 
the article written and researched with extreme care was 
based on court papers filed in new yorks family court the 
tabloid said wednesday in a statement from its lantana fla 
headquarters 
the headline mother of his child claims in court 
engelbert has aids virus is totally accurate the statement 
said adding it was published only after being closely reviewed 
by our legal counsel 
the weekly supermarket tabloid which boasts the largest 
circulation of any paper in america published the story in its 
issue dated dec 27 
humperdinck a pop singer sued tuesday contending the tabloid 
report was false and malicious the lawsuit filed in superior court 
by humperdinck lawyer robert rotstein states the entertainer 
doesnt have acquired immune deficiency syndrome and has never 
tested positive for aids 
federal health officials estimate that up to 15 million 
americans have been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus 
and of that total 20 to 30 percent will develop aids by the end of 
1991 
kathy jetter filed papers in new york citys family court

an armenian activist said thursday that human 
rights activist andrei d sakharov tried to help resolve the dispute 
between armenia and azerbaijan when he traveled to the two southern 
republics earlier this month 
rafael popoyan a former political prisoner and literary critic 
said president mikhail s gorbachev may have asked sakharov to go 
though he was ostensibly on a trip to inspect a controversial 
nuclear power plant 
they armenians say gorbachev sent him but i cant say one 
way or the other the activist said speaking by telephone from 
the armenian capital yerevan 
sakharovs wife and fellow human rights activist yelena bonner 
said wednesday that she accompanied him on a trip to armenia 
azerbaijan and nagornokarabakh the region at the heart of the 
dispute but she declined to confirm reports sakharov was shuttling 
between the two republics to calm ethnic tensions 
popoyan said the 67yearold physicist and nobel peace prize 
winner held meetings at the republics academy of sciences at a 
center for armenian refugees from azerbaijan and with armenias 
communist party chief suren arutunyan details of the meetings were 
not known he said 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov asked about the 
trip at a briefing said as far as i know he went there as a 
member of a group of academics and scholars that trip had nothing 
to do with any authority whatsoever 
the official soviet media carried no reports on sakharov 
traveling to the region 
armenians want to annex the region of nagornokarabakh which is 
predominantly ethnic armenian and christian azerbaijan is 
predominantly moslem 
curfews are in effect in parts of armenia and azerbaijan but 
tension is reported to be lower than it was a month ago when at 
least 31 people died in ethnic violence 
while in the united states last month sakharov spoke out in 
defense of armenians in the dispute and was criticized for his 
statements in articles published in the official azerbaijani press 
during his us visit the new yorkbased international league 
for human rights issued a statement from sakharov endorsing its call 
for united nations observers to investigate the ethnic unrest 
popoyan said sakharov his wife and at least one other envoy 
traveled to yerevan the azerbaijani capital baku and 
nagornokarabakh 
in nagornokarabakh the group met with the soviet leaderships 
point man in the ethnic dispute arkady volsky according to 
popoyan it appeared the groups reason for visiting the region was 
to review conditions at a controversial nuclear power plant near 
yerevan popoyan said sakharov is on the board of the prestigous 
soviet academy of sciences which the leadership has asked to look 
at the power plant 
many armenians feared the plant was damaged in the dec 7 
earthquake that devastated the northwestern part of their republic 
but soviet officials have repeatedly said the plant located on a 
geological fault was not damaged premier nikolai i ryzhkov has 
said the plant will be closed in two years because of the earthquake 
danger 
if it is confirmed gorbachev backed the mission it would be a 
highly unusual step for the kremlin to tap a longtime dissident to 
try to help settle one of its most stubborn problems 
sakharovs official standing has improved dramatically since 
gorbachev took power he was banished to the industrial city of 
gorky from 1980 to 1986 because of his outspoken opposition to 
soviet intervention in afghanistan it was gorbachev who allowed 
sakharov to return to moscow and whose government has given the 
human rights activists space in the official press to express his 
views 
while the kremlin sought new ways to quell the ethnic unrest the 
soviet supreme court in directives published wednesday set 
guidelines for a possible crackdown on activists who stirred up 
ethnic feelings 
the news agency tass said the court defined who may be tried 
under a law against whipping up ethnic tensions conviction carries 
a possible jail term of six months to three years 
the court said firing or refusing to hire workers violation of 
voting rights or depriving people of housing for ethnic reasons also 
should be punishable tass reported

a college teacher who says he was only 
relaying a letter he found on the floor of an american airlines jet 
was charged wednesday with making a bomb threat that forced the 
plane to make an unscheduled landing 
peter m canning 40 a lecturer at the university of california 
at berkeley was charged with violating a federal law concerning 
bomb threats made on board aircraft 
the letter was handed to a flight attendant on flight 240 from 
san francisco to dallas on tuesday night the pilot diverted the 
boeing 767 to albuquerque international airport where it was put on 
a remote stretch of runway and the 198 passengers evacuated 
no bomb was found 
canning appeared before us magistrate sumner buell who 
released him on his own recognizance 
the fbi said canning handed a flight attendant a note that said 
read this there are guns pointed at you if you want to live 
read the letter underneath and do what it says this is a bomb 
scare read this ps if you do what the letter says and have 
everyone else do it you will live ps if you dont you are 
history there are bombs planted all over this airplane and there 
is a gun pointed at your head take your wallet and throw it in the 
aisle now 
the fbi asked canning to provide them with a handwriting sample 
so they could compare it to the note 
a comparison of his handwriting and the note once again 
resulted in similarities which seemed apparent to special agents 
involved in this investigation the complaint said 
cannings attorney ray twohig said the incident was a mistake 
this man found a note and gave it to a flight attendant and 
because of some confusion on the part of the fbi this charge was 
filed twohig said i expect the case to be dropped within a 
week 
a friend of cannings rhonda lieberman said canning had been 
flying to new orleans for a convention of the modern language 
association 
she said canning is a native of waterbury conn who did his 
undergraduate work at northeastern university in boston he then 
spent about five years at harvard universiry earning his doctorate 
and a year studying at the university of paris two years at yale 
and then two years at berkeley 
if convicted canning could face a maximum sentence of five years 
in prison and 250000 fine buell said 
no trial date was set

after 15 years of courtordered busing that 
triggered violent opposition and white flight the city has approved 
a school assignment plan of its own in hopes of salvaging the 
troubled boston public school system 
the plan would allow parents to shop around for a school closer 
to home reducing the long bus rides many students now endure each 
day 
devised by consultants to the city school department the plan 
was endorsed in principle by the school committee wednesday night 
the board approved the plan as the general framework for a new 
student assigment plan and directed the superintendent to develop 
recommendations for implementing it 
the panel voted that at least part of the new assignment plan be 
in place by september 1989 but officials said they did not yet know 
which part of the plan that would be 
school committee member thomas oreilly hailed the plan as for 
bostonians by bostonians 
essentially what it leads to is the school committee taking 
responsibility after 14 years of not having that responsibilty in 
the way we assign our children to schools oreilly said 
the vote was 10 to 1 with two members abstaining those not 
voting in favor said the proposal leaves too many questions such as 
whether money will be allocated to upgrade unpopular schools they 
also said more review of the plan was necessary before taking a vote 
backers hope the resulting competition between schools will spur 
improvements and perhaps lure back some of the white students who 
fled to private schools or the suburbs when the desegregation order 
was imposed in 1974 amid rockthrowing protests 
weve put that kind of violence and racial strain behind us 
said john p grady a school committee member from a workingclass 
racially diverse neighborhood we want all of our children to have 
the best education we can give them as a city weve grown up 
the plan devised by consultants hired by the city school 
department was expected to win approval in some form at a school 
committee meeting wednesday night 
courtordered desegregation was spurred by a 1972 lawsuit filed 
by black parents who claimed their children were receiving 
lowerquality education than that at predominantly white schools 
in 1975 us district judge w arthur garrity jr imposed a 
busing plan after finding the city deliberately kept the schools 
segregated since then parents have had little choice in which 
schools their children attend 
at the time the lawsuit was filed the public schools served 
96000 students 60 percent of whom were white today there are 
59000 students and only 24 percent are white though whites make 
up 60 percent of the citys population fortyeight percent of the 
students are black 19 percent hispanic and 8 percent asian 
as a result some of bostons schools have in effect been 
resegregated with nearly 90 percent of their pupils members of 
minority groups grady said 
garrity returned some control over the system to the school 
committee in 1985 in 1987 a federal appeals court ruled that 
boston schools had integrated and that increased minority influence 
would prevent a return to segregated classrooms 
garrity has since left the bench but his orders in the case 
require only that a racial balance be maintained freeing the school 
committee to come up with a plan of its own 
any change in the student assignment plan would require approval 
by the state board of education which is expected 
the new plan applies to kindergarten through eighth grade and 
would take effect in the fall said ian forman a school department 
spokesman a similar plan for high schools is expected to come 
before the school committee this spring 
the plan would split the system into three zones of 14000 pupils 
each with parents permitted to choose any school within their zone 
forman said 
children would be sent to the school of their choice provided it 
did not upset the schools racial balance a lottery would be held 
for schools that were oversubscribed 
the plan is supported by mayor raymond l flynn who once was a 
fervent busing foe and superintendent laval s wilson 
but some are unconvinced that the plan will solve the school 
systems woes which include rundown buildings a perennial budget 
crunch and a 40 percent high school dropout rate 
city councilor james m kelly who has opposed the desegregation 
plan for 15 years said the new plan still denies parents what they 
have always wanted clean neighborhood schools staffed with 
dedicated teachers 
its a slight improvement over the original court orders he 
said but anyone with enough money to provide alternative 
education for their children will do so just as they have for the 
past 14 years 
hattie kckinnis executive director of the citywide parents 
council said it matters little where children attend school if they 
do not learn there 
fifteen years after garritys desegregation order she said 
parents are still looking for the light at the end of the tunnel 
as far as the quality of education is concerned thats what it was 
supposed to have been about in the first place and that has not 
been achieved 
good schools require money and parents wonder where it is 
going to come from she said

not a just step israel radio reported 
shamirs spokesman yossi ahimeir said reagans letter

gaza strip has left more than 330 palestinians and 14 israelis dead

we have no illusions about the plo we shall judge this group 
according to its deeds and its renunciation of terrorism israel 
radio quoted reagans letter as saying

a senior labor official told senators on wednesday 
that canada will need huge adjustment programs to protect workers 
whose jobs will disappear because of the canadaus free trade 
accord 
dick martin executive vice president of the canadian labor 
congress also said the government should have included a social 
charter in the pact to protect canadian working conditions in the 
face of competition from lowerwage areas of the united states 
martin suggested in his remarks before the senate foreign affairs 
committee that canadian companies would either have to cut workers 
benefits or face the loss of markets under the free trade agreement 
which will eliminate all tariff barriers between the two countries 
over a 10year period 
committee members are studying the freetrade legislation prior 
to its expected passage this week 
the senate is expected to pass the free trade legislation before 
the accord is to go into effect jan 1 canadas house of commons 
approved it last weekend and the us congress ratified agreement 
earlier this year 
another witness judith maxwell head of the economic council of 
canada said the committee should not exaggerate the negative 
aspects of the agreement 
she said that the net impact will be positive in terms of jobs 
and any adjustment programs should focus on workers not companies 
she said those programs should be broad since there will be no 
way of knowing when jobs are lost whether the loss had anything to 
do with free trade 
programs should be aimed at disadvantaged workers those who are 
elderly have limited education or skills or live in remote 
communities she added 
in his testimony martin complained that his canadian labor 
congress was never invited to join a committee set up by prime 
minister brian mulroney to look into what labor adjustment programs 
if any would be needed to help workers hurt by the trade agreement 
he said the congress the major umbrella labor organizaton in 
canada still would participate under certain conditions 
it must be assured that the freetrade labor adjustment group was 
serious about putting in place programs to help workers hurt by the 
trade deal and that the group would not be limited by concerns about 
government deficit he said 
the labor adjustment committee has done little since it was 
formed and is not expected to report until spring 
jean de grandpre the labor adjustment committee chairman and 
trade minister john crosbie are to appear before the 
liberaldominated senate committee thursday

more than 20 years ago in another time and distant place us 
marines trudged through the monsoons mud and shellfire of the 
killing fields of vietnam 
many just out of high school they fought from khe sanh where 
they withstood a bloody 77day siege to the streets of hue where 
emperors once sat and dong ha a dingy frontier town shelled so 
much the marines called it rocket city 
one battalion the 11th marines 3rd marine division helped 
plant about 100000 land mines to protect a string of us outposts 
along the 17th parallel that then divided vietnam into north and 
south 
now as the new year begins six former marines are going on a 
sentimental bittersweet patrol into the past to places halfway 
around the world once known on war maps as cam lo con thien and gio 
linh to walk again those battlefields of their youth and to look 
into the eyes of the once faceless enemy 
concerned that many of the mines they buried in the ground are 
still in place and still a threat the exmarines are returning to 
try to verify vietnamese claims that the explosives have been 
removed 
gene spanos 39 now a rosemont ill police lieutenant 
organized the mission 
other former members of the 11th marines making the journey are 
frank noe 40 a stoughton mass fireman nate genna 41 of 
boston who works in the operations and maintenance department of a 
shopping mall william johnson 41 of manchester conn an 
electricsign maker and mike wallace a 41yearold farmer from 
langdon kan 
joining them is robert dalton a 54yearold free lance writer 
from davidsonville md who served three tours of duty in vietnam 
and speaks fluent vietnamese 
they are scheduled to arrive in hanoi jan 14 on a 10day tour of 
vietnam reunified by the communistled hanoi government of the 
north that toppled the usbacked saigon government of the south 
from the countrys seat of government in hanoi they travel 
southward as friends instead of foes to familiar war zones like dong 
ha and hue capital of the annam empire established more than 200 
years before christ 
even though the vietnamese insist that they have cleared the 
mines and that the six americans are visiting the country as 
tourists their return symbolizes the further healing of wounds from 
americas longest and most divisive war 
vietnam has been opening its once closed doors wider and wider 
seeking to publicize its desire to establish diplomatic relations 
with the united states in a bid for economic aid and medical and 
technical assistance washington says that wont happen until 
vietnam removes all its troops from cambodia which hanoi has 
promised by 1990 
the latest mission is a private one paid for by a benefactor whom 
spanos will identify only as a wealthy businessman spanos says his 
group will submit its findings to both governments 
they are welcome says ambassador trinh xuan lang head of 
the vietnamese mission to the united nations they return without 
any animosity 
in the past year more than 60 american delegations have visited 
vietnam including veterans congressmen senators scholars 
journalists and tourists according to lang these visits will 
contribute to better understanding he says 
the exmarines reconstructed mine field maps and gave them to the 
vietnamese government last june while in vietnam they want to go 
to the areas with their vietnamese counterparts to take a firsthand 
look not only for land mines but also any unexploded bombs and 
shells dropped by us forces 
the once gungho marines mellowed by time hope to visit a 
vietnamese veterans hospital filled with soldiers like themselves 
and an orphanage crowded with malnourished children theyll carry 
medicine badly needed by a medical system ravaged by five decades 
of war 
i was bitter at that time genna says of his combat days at 
dong ha from january 1967 until january 1968 that whole war was 
wrong americans got killed and plenty of vietnamese got killed im 
not the 19yearold kid i was then this is a show of good will 
people to people were trying to establish one more step toward 
normalizing relations and increasing understanding between the two 
countries 
noe who served 18 months in vietnam says the trip will help 
erase an already fading and unjustified image of vietnam veterans as 
brutal killers who often aimed their shots at women and children 
many came home to rejection spat upon and called baby killers 
some turned to drugs and alcohol 
men who once fought against each other can heal old wounds and 
sit down and maybe even talk about those days says noe i think 
it will do us some good and them also i think in this country its 
going to show vietnam veterans arent what theyve been portrayed 
over the years that were firemen police from every walk of life 
and do care about people 
hundreds of people some of them veterans have telephoned and 
written words of encouragement and praise 
jacob bell the 15yearold son of another exmarine wrote a 
poem for those going back it reads in part 
so now a few who represent us all 
have heard the victims innocent call 
go for us reach out a hand 
let our country see how united we stand 
wallace who served as a medic with the 11th marines says 
were finding out its a reconciliation a healing process not 
only for veterans but for their families if you can redo some 
tragic part of life and replace it with good memories its got to 
be therapeutic 
the former marines say they never planted the mines with the 
intention of hurting civilians but rather to protect american lives 
barbed wire was placed around the mine fields with warning signs in 
vietnamese and english but after the wars end in 1975 poor 
vietnamese farmers and scavengers apparently dismantled the valuable 
barbed wire exposing the mine fields 
ambassador lang says all of the mines have been removed at the 
cost of thousands of civilians killed particularly during the three 
years following the end of the war when land was being cleared for 
farming and housing 
spanos says other veterans who visited vietnam in recent years 
reported seeing children in hospitals who had been wounded by mines 
and unexploded shells 
spanos got the idea for the goodwill mission at the 11th marines 
first reunion in chicago in september 1987 after reading an article 
in the boston globe hds greenway reported that he was told more 
than 3000 vietnamese had died in one province alone from mines and 
unexploded shells between 1975 and 85 
spanos reaction was god almighty if were still killing 
these innocent people weve got to do something lets go back

while the former engineers are not so sure dalton who has made 
three previous trips to vietnam in the past two years says he is 
convinced the mines have been removed in the northern areas although 
he cannot be as certain about other sections of the country 
i think it will be a very good thing not only for the marines 
to go back to close the door on past operations in their mind but 
also to allow the vietnamese who suffered in clearing these mine 
fields to see the americans return fully prepared to help them 
says dalton 
a 1987 report compiled by the us state department based on 
estimates provided by vietnamese government and other sources said 
there were more than 300000 people in the country who were disabled 
from the war including 15000 amputees between 7 and 15 years old 
further illustrating the desperate plight of the vietnamese 
officials estimate that half of the countrys children are 
malnourished 
the us government is forbidden by law to provide assistance to 
vietnam but has tried to make it easier for individuals and 
organizations to send humanitarian aid 
more former vietnam veterans are planning to return this year if 
they can raise the funds including a group from the veterans viet 
nam restoration project in garberville calif whose goal is to 
build and equip medical clinics across the country 
a oneman operation bill fero a 38yearold autoworker and 
farmer from whitewater wis is scheduled to make his fourth trip 
back in two years carrying medical supplies 
fero had been filled with hate for the vietnamese after a booby 
trap blew off both of his legs he suffered through 11 operations 
and twice tried suicide 
his return to vietnam he says changed his life the soldiers 
in vietnam are the same as soldiers in america they had no choice 
i was met by 200 disabled communist soldiers like me at a home in 
hanoi most of them paralyzed they treated me with so much love i 
couldnt hate them

japans economy roared ahead in 1988 with few signs 
of a slowdown but economists say regulations stifling domestic 
growth must be slashed to maintain momentum for further expansion 
strong consumer and corporate spending low inflation and 
unemployment and doubledigit increases in productivity have kept 
the pace of economic growth at an estimated 45 percent this year 
well ahead of the rest of the industrialized world 
in fiscal 1987 a 49 percent growth rate pulled the economy out 
of a slump that had raised japans jobless rate to a postwar high of 
32 percent early in the year unemployment now hovers at about 26 
percent 
since 1986 when the powerful yen battered japanese exports 
corporate streamlining cheaper import prices and lower lending 
rates have enabled japan to boost domestic demand shifting its 
engine of growth away from exports 
the yen has nearly doubled in value against the dollar since late 
1985 when monetary authorities allowed the dollars value to fall 
to improve the competitiveness of american exports and trim 
washingtons massive trade deficit 
japans stock markets also are booming despite the crash of 
october 1987 the tokyo markets key indicator the nikkei stock 
average of 225 issues ended the year at a record 3015900 
this year an inflow of funds from overseas and from the 
abolishment of taxfree savings accounts gradually is making 
available 430 trillion yen or about 355 trillion of extra cash 
boosting investment and consumer spending 
the ballooning value of assets including land and stocks and 
lower prices have made the oncefrugal japanese more aggressive 
spenders 
personal spending up an estimated 45 percent this year 
accounts for more than half of japans gross national product or 
the total output of its goods and services 
exports also continue to feed the economy after falling for 15 
months from yearearlier levels japans trade surplus reversed 
direction in july and began to rise 
the latest gnp figures show the economy grew at a 93 percent 
annual rate from july to september following a 39 percent 
contraction in the previous quarter 
the expansion stemmed mainly from strong domestic demand and from 
exports which are growing 20 percent a year outpacing imports 
which grew at a 13 percent annual rate finance ministry officials 
predict the trend will continue 
reports by the ministry of international trade and industry show 
that japan will not meet its target this year for cutting its trade 
surplus by 11 billion from 7983 billion in 1987 despite 
projections that imports from the united states will grow 907 
percent and those from europe 1074 percent 
there is little danger of the economy overheating however 
because japan is almost inflationproof says richard c koo senior 
economist at nomura research institute prices rose a scant 01 
percent in 1987 and have stayed almost flat this year 
the yens strength and lower oil prices should help keep prices 
relatively stable into the forseeable future bank of japan governor 
satoshi sumita says but he has expressed concern a labor shortage 
could cause problems later 
the ratio of job offers to applicants hit 105 in june 
reflecting intensifying employer competition for a shrinking pool of 
skilled workers labor economist eiko shinotsuka says 
the low jobless rate is frustrating expansionminded 
executives ms shinotsuka wrote in a recent article many 
manufacturing companies would like to augment output to meet surplus 
demand but cannot recruit enough skilled workers 
labor shortages are pinching construction and service companies 
but overtime and high productivity rising about 10 percent per 
year are helping to insulate manufacturers from wagerelated 
inflation says susumu kato chief economist at the tokyo offices of 
the british banking concern county natwest 
there is also the rest of the world to cause potential problems 
global economic integration has made japan more vulnerable to 
shocks from overseas says johsen takahashi director of mitsubishi 
research institute 
japan accounted for 39 percent or 95 trillion of the combined 
capital of the london new york tokyo and frankfurt financial 
markets in 1987 
that figure is likely to have grown in 1988 as funds flowed into 
tokyos stock exchange attracted by its phenomenal postcrash 
performance 
while economic fundamentals point to a continuation of tokyos 
bull market another shock like black monday in new york would pull 
tokyos market down takahashi says 
one lesson of last year is that all markets move together 
says koo 
some economists warn that japan needs a new source of economic 
energy 
housing starts which led the economic recovery in 1987 have 
declined since their peak in july and increased reliance on export 
growth would worsen trade friction 
kato predicts higher wages will fuel a 65 percent increase in 
consumer spending next year but says the economy needs a further 
boost from deregulation to achieve continued 5 percent growth 
a government advisory council said in a recent report that 
overregulation has stifled japans retail sector agriculture 
transportation telecommunications finance and energy 
government regulations should be limited to regulations needed 
to deal with emergencies or other abnormal situations the report 
said 
at question is whether the political will exists to enact changes 
that have been resisted for decades by the special interests 
protected by those regulations 
on dec 13 the government approved a program aimed at easing a 
wide range of controls to help vitalize the private sector and open 
japans markets to imports 
the program would promote rationalization of japans convoluted 
distribution system and free competition throughout the economy 
if the government meets its challenge by deregulating the 
economy further there will be plenty of demand to keep the economy 
growing says koo

japanese firms are waking up to the need to recruit 
minority employees in the united states but only after prodding by 
us officials and civil rights groups 
japanese companies came under fire for not hiring enough 
minorities particularly blacks in the united states following a 
string of remarks by politicians and sales campaigns in japan that 
smacked of racism 
racial awareness in japan takes on added significance as growing 
japanese investment in america 147 billion in fiscal 1987 
according to japanese statistics puts more american workers in 
japaneseowned businesses 
they dont realize they are obliged under the federal contract 
compliance program to achieve certain goals and quotas if they do 
business with the us government says colleen oconnor of the 
american civil liberties union 
the hiring regulations apply to japanese firms whether they 
sell engines to the pentagon or cameras to the forest service ms 
oconnor says 
remarks by former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone and exfinance 
minister michio watanabe in the past two years suggested that blacks 
were intellectually inferior and defaulted on their debts 
japanese toys resembling black sambo figures with huge eyes and 
distorted red lips and advertising campaigns using similarly 
exaggerated mannequins last summer further angered american blacks 
sanrio creator of the sambolike figures recalled the products 
at a loss of 115 million and also apologized announcing it would 
donate 257000 in toys to poor children in san francisco 
but black dolls continue to sell in japan including a black 
sambo santa claus this past christmas season and are used in 
numerous advertisments 
mervyn dymally a black us congressman from california has 
complained that japan was not making progress on racial awareness 
in typical asian fashion they have been very polite but nothing 
has happened he said 
more than two dozen black organizations called for a buyamerican 
campaign during christmas to impress upon japan the power of 
american blacks 300 billion in annual consumer spending 
japanese companies argue that they are complying with us 
regulations but like some us firms it may take legal action to 
force them into action 
in march the equal employment opportunities commission ordered 
honda of america manufacturing to pay 6 million to 377 blacks and 
women for not hiring them sooner 
its primarily a cultural difference said john eastman of 
the us civil rights commission in a telephone interview in 
hondas case once they realized the law they established positive 
recruitment they were willing to sit down and negotiate and put in 
place an equal opportunity program 
but robert cole of the university of michigans business school 
and visiting professor at tokyos keio university says japanese 
firms tend to locate in areas away from high minority concentration 
cole studied 100 sites of auto manufacturers and suppliers in the 
united states what i found was that japanese autorelated firms 
located in areas with relatively few blacks he said in an 
interview in tokyo 
honda is in a region with a black labor pool of 105 percent but 
is only 28 percent black at its facilities in marysville ohio 
according to coles study nissan in smyrna tenn would be 
expected to have 193 percent minorities but has 14 percent and 
mazda in flat rock mich has 141 percent black employment vs 29 
percent available 
the minority employment ratio at the three major us automakers 
is much higher than the 11 percent that blacks represent in the us 
labor force cole says 
japanese manufacturers have located in rural areas which are 
not heavily populated by minorities agrees the civil rights 
commissions eastman theyre not locating in suburban chicago 
detroit or cleveland 
honda spokesman roger lambert disagrees with coles calculations 
claiming the black labor pool within reasonable commuting distance 
of honda is only 35 percent honda also recruits blacks from ohio 
high schools lambert says 
like toyota and electronics giant sony honda contributes to the 
national association for the advancement of colored people united 
negro college fund and urban league these companies also have 
increased advertising in minority publications like ebony and black 
enterprise magazines and in other black community media 
sony and toyota retain agencies specializing in marketing to 
minority consumers 
yet cole says interviews with auto and investment consultants 
found that japanese companies systematically sought areas with low 
concentrations of blacks and other minorities 
japanese firms do this for risk minimization cole says 
blacks are an unknown quantity 
japanese manufacturers particularly automakers with large 
production facilities bristle at suggestions of racism 
we have an absolute policy of equal opportunity for minorities 
and women said a toyota spokesman in tokyo noting that toyotas 
minority employment in kentucky where the automaker operates a 
plant in georgetown is 13 percent the highest in the state it 
also began its team toyota equal access for minorities program in 
march to expand minority hiring 
nissan harbors no discrimination based on race sex or 
ideology says a company spokesman the states set a minimum for 
minority hiring and weve cleared them for certain 
he acknowledged however that tennessee where nissan has its 
factory has no such regulations nissan does not release statistics 
on its minority hiring 
sony which employs 7000 people in the united states also 
contributes to minority programs at new york colleges says sony 
spokesman tom sugiyama 
we offer trainee positions to minorities and if they qualify 
will be permanently hired sugiyama says we are obliged to meet 
affirmative action plans we are above the average 
sony also assists young black artists in film television and 
music 
toshibas policy on racial hiring is to leave it to our people 
there a spokesman said we basically support equal opportunity 
based on local laws and regulations concerning sex age or color 
its all within the law the spokesman who would not be named 
declined to provide further information 
minority groups are also pressing for increased management roles 
including auto dealerships from the japanese 
according to the national association of minority automobile 
dealers nissan has only one minority dealership 01 percent of its 
total and toyota has three 03 percent while blacks own just 
eight of nearly 5000 japanese car dealerships in america 
ford has 170 minority dealerships 34 percent and gm 204 2 
percent the association says 
improvements come slowly theres a learning curve and the 
japanese are quick students says cole but it doesnt seem to 
me that theyre taking any leadership role and i find that 
disturbing

fifty years ago the cash income of american 
farmers was improving from the depression low marks and the outlook 
for 1939 appeared reasonably bright to agriculture department 
experts 
the world would change forever before 1939 ended as germanys 
invasion of poland spread into world war ii at the moment however 
farmers had more money to spend and usda economists were watching 
where it went 
higher cash income from farm marketings in 1939 was anticipated 
by the usda experts who also noted that government payments 
probably will exceed 1938 payments and that income from nonfarm 
sources could a rise a bit too 
as incomes rise farm families tend to spend part of the 
increase for living but they apply a larger share than do city 
families toward getting ahead financially paying off debts and 
making improvements on the farm said a usda outlook report of 
december 1938 
the report added dollar for dollar the farm familys money 
income is expected to stretch about as far next year as this since 
the general level of prices of commodities bought for living is 
expected to change little in 1939 from late 1938 
some of the 50yearold usda analysis appears familiar 
economists are saying much the same today about the role of federal 
payments inflation and debts 
but the old report mentions something else the change by 1939 in 
the lifestyle and expectations of american farm families 
during the 1930s there has been a trend toward broadened social 
contacts for farm families through improved transportation and 
communication the report said better roads more widespread 
ownership and greater use of automobilies and an increased number 
of radios have contributed to this development 
television was still a science fiction dream for most americans 
in 1939 and it was radio that brought news and entertainment to 
remote areas of the country with battery sets and the gradual 
spread of electric power lines 
about threefifths of all farm families now have radios and 
there is likelihood of a further increase in 1939 the report said 
further there was evidence that a larger proportion of farm 
families owned automobiles than their city cousins one study in 
193536 found that up to 85 percent of the nativewhite 
nonrelief families of farm operators owned automobiles the 
report said obviously excluding millions of black and white 
families in the mid1930s who were too poor to own automobiles 
trends toward more comfortable living are evidenced by 
electrification and other improvements of farm homes and by 
purchases of household equipment that lightens labor the report 
said electricity now is used on 18 percent of all farms as 
compared with 13 percent in 1930 
it added these trends bid fair to continue in 1939 in part 
because of the government program of encouraging rural 
electrification and in part because of anticipated income 
increases 
already the improved farm economy cash income was estimated at 
763 billion in 1938 compared with 433 billion in 1932 had 
brought fundamental and everlasting changes in how money was spent 
in twothirds of the farm areas included in a 193536 study of 
family living expenditures for the purchase and operation of the 
family car took about onesixth of the aggregate expenditures for 
all living of nonrelief nativeborn white families of farm 
operators the report said 
a 192224 study showed less than onetenth of expenditures 
allocated to the familys use of the automobile it added 
five months later in may 1939 the usdas monthly outlook report 
was uncertain about the way things were going wheat prices were 
still depressed but edged to an average of 578 cents per bushel 
the highest in a year hogs at 657 per 100 pounds were down more 
than a dollar 
unfavorable european political developments and the 
accompanying sharp declines in security prices during march and 
early april were followed by an extensive coal strike the may 
1939 report said 
recent developments have helped to postpone and might even 
prevent altogether the moderate improvement in business and demand 
conditions which has been anticipated it added but with 
building construction continuing very active government spending at 
a high level and most lines of industry doing about as well as could 
be expected there is no reason to expect any serious recession even 
if some of the present uncertainties continue for a time

its smooth its quiet the 1989 bmw 535i seems to glide across 
the road 
its hard not to daydream when driving becomes as effortless and 
comfortable as it is in this new model from bmw but the 535is 
price tag a hefty 43600 base price may jolt you out of the 
reverie 
newly designed for the 1989 model year the 535i borrows many 
fine traits from its bigger kin the 7series that was introduced in 
1987 there is a distinctive bmw outward appearance an inner 
luxuriousness and quiet ride 
the 535i goes further however in its sporty appeal suspension 
is superb taut this car holds the road in all kinds of maneuvers 
at all speeds antilock brakes are exceptional especially at high 
speeds the engine an improved version of bmws 35 liter is 
impressive 
the test car was a fivespeed manual and shifting was smooth and 
flawless response from the inline sixcylinder engine was 
immediate at each standing start there was a strong push from the 
rear wheels the car is reardrive 
the powerplant is capable of developing 208 horsepower up from 
182 in the old engine yet even with the boost in power the bmw is 
ohsoquiet thanks to improved sounddeadening materials and a 
sleek line along the compact aerodynamic outer body that reduces 
wind noise 
the interior of the test version was easily one of the most 
comfortable of any car with leather seats that were electrically 
adjustable and dashboard instruments that were wellorganized and 
wellplaced 
the steering wheel however was not adjustable because of the 
airbag stowed in it the fuel tank had room for 21 gallons a 
convenience on long trips with so much fuel it took a while for 
the fuel gauge needle to budge from the full mark 
there were unique touches for example the windshield wipers 
adjusted their speed to the speed of the car and the wipers 
automatically pressed harder against the windshield on the drivers 
side as speed increased and the drivers door lock was heated just 
by lifting the door handle for a moment 
there also was an onboard computer that chimed and lighted up 
below the speedometer to warn the driver when the car exceeded the 
speed limit programmed in by the driver 
i had a dickens of a time getting used to that perhaps because 
in a car this quiet this smooth it was so easy to speed 
for 1989 bmw also added 54 inches to the 535is wheelbase and 
made the car 1 inch wider it trimmed the length by 32 inches but 
added 260 pounds to the car height is about the same 
competitors include the mercedes 300e and jaguar xj6 bmw 
spokesman rob mitchell said 
were all in the same price category and all are fairly 
luxurious cars he said but in ours we are more 
driveroriented more sporting we put more emphasis on the driver 
sales and rave reviews from the auto press have been 
encouraging the 535i and its lowerpriced 37000 base sister 
the 525i started to trickle in last october sales through november 
totaled 2529 for the two models combined mitchell said 
that accounts for about 23 percent of total bmw sales which is 
the percentage share that bmw planned for the 5series he said for 
calendar 1989 the automaker looks for 21000 sales of 5series 
cars up from 14000 in 1988 when the old 5series cars were being 
phased out of production but as the price indicates not everyone 
can afford one 
mitchell said previous 535i owners when the base price was 
around 37000 have been predominantly male 81 percent with 
average household income of 130000 a year the average age is 41 
and 35 percent are business executives 20 percent professionals 10 
percent middle management and 10 percent selfemployed 
because the 535i is newly designed for 1989 consumer reports 
does not list owner trouble reports for this model in the past 
however costs for repairs have been much higher than those for 
average cars

a massive stockprofiteering scandal emperor 
hirohitos illness and other obstacles failed to slow the worlds 
richest stock market as it ended 1988 at a record high up 42 
percent for the year 
analysts looked for gains to continue into next year on the tokyo 
stock exchange where the start of the sixday new year holidays 
began with a ritual handclapping by 2000 traders 
in what one dealer described as a festival market wednesday 
the 225share nikkei stock average climbed 10807 points or 036 
percent and ended the year at a record 3015900 
the nikkei had opened 1988 at 2121704 by april it was at the 
27000point level above its highs before the october 1987 crash 
the foundering new york and london markets have yet to regain 
precrash levels 
analysts said the market climbed despite a number of obstacles 
including a massive stockprofiteering scandal emperor hirohitos 
illness currency fluctuations and unstable oil prices 
there were some negative factors from time to time but the 
overall market situation was healthy and bullish throughout the 
year said mike morizumi at merrill lynch amp cos tokyo office 
all bad news has been discounted already and the market is as 
strong as it looks he said it turned out to be much better 
than most of us expected at the beginning of the year 
josen takahashi a chief economist at mitsubishi research 
institute a major thinktank said tokyo was able to recover faster 
than other markets from the 1987 crash because of japans brisk 
economic growth and a calm business environment 
japan was in the middle of a historical domestic demand 
expansion in the fourth quarter of 1987 and the first quarter of 
1988 takahashi said the market crash luckily coincided with 
that period 
analysts said however that the rise of tokyo stock prices was 
hindered by a major scandal in which dozens of prominent politicians 
and business leaders were offered unlisted shares in recruitcosmos 
a real estate company at bargain rates they profited after the 
stock was publicly offered and rose in price 
the transactions were legal but opposition parties and the 
general public questioned the ethics of influential figures taking 
advantage of privileged access to unlisted shares 
the scandal knocked a lot of confidence from the market and it 
prevented the nikkei from moving high said morizumi and there 
are still some aftereffects 
starting in april investors gains from stock transactions wont 
be as big a tax reform package enacted this week imposes a 20 
percent capital gains tax but the tax is not expected to adversely 
affect the market 
the illness of the 87yearold emperor has been seen as a damper 
on active investing hirohito fell seriously ill on sept 19 and has 
been bedridden 
many investors do not want to be sitting with large stock 
holdings when the emperor dies analysts said 
the market will go down a little bit when he does die said 
morizumi but thats just a sympathetic gesture and it will 
recover thereafter 
thomas zengage of international business information a 
consulting firm based in tokyo said most major problems in the 
market already have been reflected in current share prices and 
bullishness likely will carry into the first half of 1989 
unless there is a dramatic change in the market environment 
such as the sudden crash of land prices or a drastic fluctuation of 
exchange rates the tokyo stock market will continue to be strong 
for a while he said 
with total value of shares exceeding 400 trillion yen or aout 
323 trillion the tokyo stock exchange is the worlds richest the 
japanese market accounts for about 45 percent of the total value of 
the worlds stock markets compared with about 30 percent for the 
united states

us manufacturers of small business telephone 
equipment will continue to suffer financially with their very 
survival in jeopardy if japan korea and taiwan are allowed to 
continue selling their products at unfairly low prices american 
telephone amp telegraph co charges 
atampt on wednesday filed a petition asking the commerce department 
to investigate charges that more than a dozen foreign manufacturers 
are setting cutrate prices for their equipment marketed in the 
united states while charging more for the same equipment in their 
home markets 
if this pricing practice continues the future survival of the 
domestic industry is truly in doubt atampt said in its petition 
domestic producers have already been substantially weakened 
financially and their ability to continue to make the capital and 
research investments necessary to remain competitive in this market 
has been severely compromised atampt said 
atampt said its government business systems the largest us 
manufacturer of these products has already been forced to make 
unspecified cuts and further reductions in the future may be 
necessary 
ultimately the domestic smallbusiness telephone systems 
industry and the technological base it embodies may disappear 
altogether atampt said 
in its petition atampt detailed the extent of the damage the 
foreign manufacturers alleged underselling has caused to its own 
operations but many of those details were deleted from copies of 
the complaint made public 
under us law it is illegal for foreign companies to sell 
products in the us market for less than they sell them at home 
when atampt announced last week that it would file the petition it 
said the foreign companies prices in their home markets were an 
average 75 percent higher than their prices in the us market and 
in one case 170 percent higher 
the petition involves equipment for small businesses with two to 
80 phone lines the two major types are known as key systems and 
private branch exchanges or pbxs 
the commerce department has 20 days in which to decide whether to 
investigate atampts charges if it initiates an investigation the 
international trade commission will begin a separate probe to 
determine whether the alleged dumping has harmed the us 
industry and will make a preliminary finding within 45 days 
final determinations by both the department and the commission 
and possible imposition of antidumping duties would occur in about 
a year 
the japanese companies named in the petition are hasegawa 
iwatsu matsushita maisei nakayo nitsuko tamura and toshiba 
also named were south koreas goldstar opc and samsung and 
taiwans sun moon star

a swap of a threeyear wage freeze for a 90 
million plant modernization program will help secure jobs at hj 
heinz cos pittsburgh plant union leaders say 
the single most important gain we achieved in this contract is 
a new factory said michael kedzuf president of united food and 
commercial workers local 325 
without such a program workers could have expected an extreme 
and rapid reduction in the work force as heinz shifted products to 
factories with lower production costs kedzuf said wednesday 
the 1000 members are to vote on the fiveyear contract by mail 
ballots will be counted jan 6 
once the plant is modernized bluecollar employment is expected 
to drop from the current 1000 to about 750 through normal attrition 
and a sweetened early retirement package but not through layoffs 
kedzuf said 
for the first three years workers would not receive a raise in 
the last two years workers would get a 35centperhour raise and 
costofliving increases 
the average union salary is 1097 per hour over five years the 
contract should increase average hourly pay by about 147 the

orthopedic surgeons a burly sort among physicians 
face occupational hazards ranging from misplaced pins and falling 
traction weights to accidental scalpel stabbings according to a 
survey 
writing in this weeks british medical journal three doctors 
report that orthopedic surgery can be extremely hazardous and 
nobody in the operating theater is safe 
the christmas issue of the prestigious journal is filled with 
oddities such as the effect of haggis the scottish national dish 
on cholesterol levels a woman whose vast intake of tomato soup 
discolored her skin disorders caused by eating mangoes and the 
connection between opiumsmoking and cauliflower ear among elderly 
chinese patients 
theres no telling whether the orthopedic researchers see a real 
crisis or are just saying tongueincheek that hey 
bonedoctors have feelings too the research method does however 
appear rigorous enough to cause some consternation in orthopedic 
circles 
drs ivan brenkel of the leeds hospital orthopedic department 
joseph dias of glenfield hospital leicester and sg tordoff of 
poole general hospital said they mailed questionnaires to some 1000 
british orthopedic surgeons including retired consultants and 
received 355 replies 
their conclusion the combination of brute force and sharp 
instruments needed lays the orthopedic surgeon open to painful and 
occasionally serious injury 
among the remarkable number of mishaps reported the most 
bizarre involves a mouse 
a certain surgeon was about to operate on a patient under a 
spinal anesthetic when suddenly a mouse ran across the floor of the 
theater causing consternation and terror among the nursing staff 
its whereabouts were unknown until suddenly the patient sat up and 
pointing at the mouse shouted triumphantly there it is 
order having been restored by catching the mouse the surgeon 
advanced once more toward the operating table in doing so he struck 
his head violently against the rim of the operating lamp not 
noticing that it had been placed somewhat lower than usual he 
collapsed on to the floor briefly concussed 
while that sort of mishap could befall any surgeon others 
reported in the article were strictly orthopedic 
surgeons frequently skewer themselves or their assistants with 
denham pins the doctors wrote the most extreme example was 
given by one consultant who during the insertion of a denham pin 
into a patients leg managed to transfix his assistants hand and 
impale the patients other leg the unfortunate assistant had to 
wait to be cut free 
denham pins are inserted into bones to hold traction weights 
one surgeon mentioned in the report handed a scalpel to a nurse 
and accidentally stabbed a colleague in the midriff 
there are numerous reports of buckets of plaster and traction 
weights crushing a surgeons foot the doctors wrote one slipped 
on discarded surgical towels and ruptured his achilles tendon while 
another slipped on stairs and sustained a fracture 
orthopedic surgeons are no safer at home the doctors wrote 
citing one who injured a finger rescuing his dog from a fight while 
another who vacationing in the caribbean had a finger tendon 
severed by a bite from the barracuda he had just landed 
to avoid injury surgeons are advised to change their spectacles 
get their assistants to do the dangerous work or become 
anesthetists there are no reports of injuries to doctors while 
doing the times crossword puzzle 
a separate article in the journal by dr david barrett of the 
royal berkshire hospital surveyed surgical glove sizes at 30 
british hospitals and found that orthopedic surgeons take a size 
76 against 74 for ordinary surgeons 
from this he concluded that like their forerunners who had to be 
big and strong to overcome muscle spasm and hold broken bones 
together todays bonesetters tend to be just under an inch 
taller than other surgeons 
one explanation he wrote could be that orthopedics is still 
perceived as a macho specialty so that only the largest trainees 
are encouraged to apply 
he added this image is of course hurtful to orthopedic 
surgeons who under their larger exterior are deeply sensitive 
people who are kind to animals and help old ladies to cross the 
street

pursuit of bargains or returning gifts found themselves going down 
an overcrowded up escalator 
so many people rushed onto the escalator it stopped and the 
sheer weight made it reverse lazarus store manager lance lambert 
said monday 
for a brief moment people thought they were going nowhere 
fast 
shoppers headed for the stores second floor were cleared from 
the escalator and a more orderly procession allowed the escalators 
gears to do their job

the 12nation european commission today 
condemned the us decision to impose sanctions on european food 
exports in response to a ban on us hormonetreated meat 
the us decisions are totally unjustifiable and contrary to 
international standards european commissioner willy de clercq 
said in a statement 
the us government announced tuesday that beginning jan 1 it 
will impose 100 million worth of trade sanctions against european 
food products in retaliation for a scheduled common market ban on 
imports of us meat that contains growth hormones 
the us action in effect doubles the wholesale price for us 
consumers for such products as imported hams and canned italian 
tomatoes 
european consumer groups have argued that using growth hormones 
fed to cattle to increase their bulk poses a potential human health 
threat 
any country and thus the community has the right to take 
measures it judges necessary to protect the health of its 
consumers de clercq said as long as they are not 
discriminatory 
the united states contends that the presence of the hormones in 
meat is too small to be hazardous and that scientific evidence of 
their threat to health is inconclusive 
four eec countries west germany italy the netherlands and 
belgium have banned all hormones in cattle breeding for years the 
eec has banned seven hormones 
trade between the united states and the european community totals 
150 billion annually but the sides have been locked in an 
increasingly bitter trade dispute 
faced with the possibility of us sanctions over its hormone 
ban the eec tentatively agreed on dec 19 on a list of us 
products on which it would impose a 100 percent duty if washington 
goes ahead with its trade sanctions 
this would include us exports of honey unshelled nuts dried 
fruit and canned corn 
the european commission is ready de clercq told the belgian 
radio it has already proposed a list of measures which will have 
to be adapted to the announced us measures that are weaker than 
previously announced we have to take into account the attenuated 
character of these measures 
eec officials have lately added another reason for banning 
hormones they claim there is already too much meat on the eec and 
world markets therefore they see no need for boosting production 
with hormones 
australia new zealand brazil and argentina have agreed to 
export hormonefree beef to europe

communications giant american telephone and telegraph co broken 
up by the government five years ago in a landmark antitrust case 
has started to expand aggressively by acquiring other companies 
atampt announced tuesday that it would purchase paradyne corp a 
largo fla maker and repairer of data transmission devices for 
250 million the acquisition would give new yorkbased atampt a 
stronger position in the world market for datacommunications 
equipment 
it is the largest acquisition by atampt since its 1983 divestiture 
which revolutionized the telephone industry in the united states by 
creating competing companies and spawning a 185 billion a year 
business 
the paradyne announcement appeared to reflect atampts willingness 
to grow by taking over other companies rather than internal 
expansion it came one week after atampt agreed to acquire eaton 
financial services an office equipment leasing concern based in 
framingham mass 
under the latest deal atampt will pay 1025 in cash for all of 
paradynes outstanding shares the announcement almost doubled the 
price of the target companys stock which rose 475 a share to 10 
tuesday on the new york stock exchange and was the most heavily 
traded issue of the day 
paradyne which develops and manufactures data communications 
equipment ran into legal troubles a year ago in connection with its 
attempt to land a big government computer contract 
the company was fined 12 million in march 1987 after pleading 
guilty to scheming to defraud the social security administration to 
obtain a 115 million computer contract in 1981 the largest ever 
awarded by that agency 
as part of a federal plea agreement the government dropped six 
other counts of bribery and making false statements and robert s 
wiggins agreed to resigned as chairman president and chief 
executive officer 
paradyne hasnt had a profitable year since 1984 it lost 26 
million last year 385 million in 1986 and 312 million a year 
earlier in october the company said it wrote off about 26 million 
in losses for the third quarter 
but atampt spokesman dick gray said paradynes new management 
team has been turning things around theyve taken steps to improve 
their operations and improve their chances of profitability 
our folks have examined the companys operation and are 
satisfied he said the problems they faced in the past are just 
that in the past 
since last years settlement paradyne has withdrawn old and 
unprofitable product lines from the market and said it would focus 
on other goods that it could market effectively in august about 
300 employees were laid off in a costsaving measure 
the companies plan to merge the existing data communications 
equipment operations of paradyne and atampt with the resulting 
business entity becoming a subsidiary of atampt john mitcham 
president and chief executive officer of paradyne will head that 
unit 
merging these lines will enable this new atampt subsidiary to 
offer an even more comprehensive line of products and services to 
meet our customers global data networking needs said jack 
bucter atampt vice president for product management and marketing 
paradyne had 1987 worldwide sales of 233 million with assets 
totaling 263 million the company distributes products in 47 
countries and employs 2600 people worldwide 
atampt had 1987 revenue of 336 billion

sunshine mining co says it will pay 8652 million 
for plastics and petrochemical maker rexene corp reflecting a 
strategy to buy only businesses that do not depend on natural gas or 
precious metal prices 
we decided about nine months ago that strategically we needed 
to put a third leg on the stool needed to get into a third line of 
business said g michael boswell sunshines chairman and chief 
executive officer 
sunshine officials said tuesday that the company known primarily 
for silver mining and natural gas production would pay 28 for each 
of rexenes 309 million shares of common stock in cash and 
securities 
officials with the two dallasbased firms said the deal is 
subject to shareholder approval 
rexene through its subsidiary rexene products co makes 
thermoplastic resins and petrochemical products its products are 
used in many household goods including food packaging toys 
plastic linings for disposable diapers and styrene for production 
of disposable cups and other containers 
sunshine lost more than 11 million during the quarter ending 
sept 30 while rexene made more than 35 million 
sunshine officials said the match is a natural for both 
companies joe denahan executive vice president and chief financial 
officer for sunshine said that when oil and gas prices are low so 
are the prices for the raw materials used by rexene 
last week rexene announced that an unidentified public company 
was interested in buying all outstanding shares the company which 
went public in july was among the biggest gainers on the new york 
stock exchange last week rising 50 percent 
trading in rexenes stock was halted early tuesday pending the 
announcement and resumed later in the morning it closed down 250 
at 22 a share on the nyse evidently reflecting investor 
disappointment with the announcement 
part of sunshines strategy has been to acquire a third line of 
business related to natural resources but not to oil and gas and 
precious metals boswell said 
sunshines acquisition of rexene fits this criteria as the 
bulk of rexenes raw materials are derivatives of natural gas 
liquids he said 
boswell said sunshine plans no layoffs and will run the new 
business using the current management 
rexenes primary production plants are both in texas in odessa 
and near houston 
we hope to reach a definitive agreement quickly and look 
forward to working with sunshine said rexenes chairman and chief 
executive officer andrew j smith 
one thing that made rexene so attractive to us was that they 
had a strong management team already in place that is willing to 
stay said boswell they have expressed no interest in leaving

officials of ltv corp say disagreements among 
members of the largest creditor group in a 2yearold bankruptcy 
reorganization has led to a formal split into two new unsecured 
creditors committees 
dallasbased ltv said tuesday that it supported the decision to 
separate the committee of unsecured creditors into two groups one 
committee now represents ltvs steel co creditors and the other 
represents parent company creditors 
the action follows frustration on all sides as to how to best 
get this reorganization going and to stop the bickering between 
creditors said one major creditor of ltv steel who asked not to 
be identified 
one fundamental difference between the creditors has been the 
resolution of a longstanding conflict between ltv and the 
governmentrun pension benefit guaranty corp over three underfunded 
ltv steel pension plans 
a single committee has been an effective way to minimize the 
financial and administrative burdens of the proceeding since the 
chapter 11 filing in july 1986 through its current stage said james 
f powers ltv chief financial officer 
however the creditors believe the final stages leading to the 
companys emergence from chapter 11 can be most effectively 
addressed with the new structure said powers the company 
agrees with this decision and will work with the two committees to 
complete the plan of reorganization negotiation process as 
expeditiously as possible 
the formal split into two committees was a positive 
development in the reorganization said robin e phelan an 
attorney representing banctexas dallas a trustee for some ltv 
creditors 
it will further enhance prospects for a successful 
reorganization for the ltv corp and ltv steel because it will help 
further the negotiating process and delineate issues between 
creditors of ltv steel and ltv corp said phelan

the chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee said today that despite a european ban on us meat from 
hormonefed cattle some european farmers still use growth hormones 
like those at the center of a dispute threatening a fullblown 
useuropean trade war 
the ec has said the meat constitutes a health threat to consumers 
the fact is however that their own own farmers not 
withstanding their objections to growth hormones grow their meat 
with growth hormones said sen patrick leahy on cbs this 
morning 
they realize as we do that those hormones are out of the meat 
before theyre slaughtered so thats really not the issue said 
leahy dvt 
both sides are locked in an acrimonious dispute which threatens 
to spill over into other areas of trade between america and its 
european allies twoway trade between the united states and the 
european community totals 150 billion annually 
on tuesday the reagan administration vowed to impose 100 
million worth of trade sanctions against european food products 
starting at 1201 am on jan 1 
the 100 percent duties will effectively double the wholesale 
price at the us border for such popular products as hams canned 
italian tomatoes and imported wine coolers 
us trade representative clayton yeutter said the stiff duties 
will go into effect unless the europeans back down on their ban on 
imported meat products which contain growth hormones 
the meat ban which is to be applied to all european suppliers 
not just the united states is scheduled to take effect on jan 1 
australia new zealand brazil and argentina already have agreed to 
ship only hormonefree beef to europe 
yeutter who is presidentelect bushs choice for agriculture 
secretary said the european ban constituted an unfair trade 
practice because there was no scientific evidence that the hormones 
which are used to increase bulk cause any health effects in humans 
the common market countries contend that while the scientific 
evidence on meat hormones is not conclusive they have the right to 
take precautionary action to protect health 
in a statement the reagan administration said the us food and 
drug administration had determined that the daily production of 
hormones in humans even in children is far higher than the 
minuscule levels left in meat from treated animals 
we have tried repeatedly to bring this issue to a scientific 
dispute settlement panel under the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade in order to have it resolved yeutter said in a statement 
however our european counterparts have blocked our efforts 
yeutter said the 100 million in duties roughly equals the 
estimated lost sales of american meat products in europe 
but nico wegter the agriculture affairs spokesman for the ec 
today disputed yeutters contention saying the europeans want the 
gatt dialogue to include more than a discussion of scientific 
arguments 
we would have a discussion take into account all arguments 
concerned including the economic one including the consumer 
argument and that is what the americans dont want to have said 
wegter on abctvs good morning america 
we have gone now to gatt because we do not accept the 
retaliation measures which have now been announced by the american 
administration we dont think that those measures are compatible 
with the gatt rules wegter added 
also the european commission the executive committee of the ec 
today condemned the us decision to impose sanctions as totally 
unjustifiable and contrary to international standards 
any country and thus the community has the right to take 
measures it judges necessary to protect the health of its 
consumers european commissioner willy de clercq said in a 
statement from brussels 
the europeans have vowed to hike duties on other us products if 
america makes good on its threat to retaliate us officials pledge 
they will counter the counterretaliation one proposal being 
considered by the us side is a ban on all european meat imports 
worth 450 million a year 
officials are predicting that at least the initial ban on meat 
containing growth hormones and the 100 percent duties announced by 
yeutter on tuesday will take effect on jan 1 since there are no 
talks scheduled before that time 
however officials held out hope that the dispute could still be 
settled early in 1989 
in los angeles where president reagan is vacationing deputy 
white house press secretary lesley arsht said the administration had 
not lost sight of the fact that the european community and the 
united states are major trading partners and allies 
we have our differences over trade but there is a mechanism 
for resolving them and we have no reason to believe this one wont 
be resolved also he said 
however the new dispute comes at a time of simmering unhappiness 
between america and its european allies 
the europeans are upset over continued insistence by both reagan 
and bush that all countries should scrap tradedistorting farm 
subsidies over the next several years and americans are worried 
that despite denials to the contrary the european community will 
erect new protectionist barriers blocking american goods as part of 
their effort to create a single market for much of europe by 1992 
the list of european products upon which the higher 100 percent 
duties will be imposed include beef pork hams and shoulders 
excluding those that have been boned cooked and packed in airtight 
containers canned tomatoes instant coffee extracts and wine 
coolers containing less than 7 percent alcohol 
also subject to the duties will be both fresh and concentrated 
fruit juices and pet food packaged for retail sale 
the united states had originally considered imposing 120 million 
in duties but it lowered the total after the europeans agreed not 
to ban hormonetreated meat that was intended for use as pet food 
the ban on hormonetreated meat which also applies to european 
meat producers was to have taken effect last jan 1 but it was 
delayed to allow time for negotiations with washington and to give 
european producers more time to adjust to the ban 
us officials complain that the common market ban would require 
a costly new government inspection system to make sure that the 
shipments to europe come from the half of american cattle that are 
not treated with growth hormones 
the common market countries are france britain ireland 
denmark the netherlands belgium luxembourg west germany italy 
greece spain and portugal

a selloff prompted by badly needed rain overnight in a key brazilian 
soybean state

percent of brazils soybean production brought the best rain to 
brazil in a long time in the state they needed it most said 
victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds inc in 
chicago 
he said more rain was forecast for later this week in brazil and 
argentina the worlds second and fourthlargest soybean producers 
easing fears about drought damage to the newly planted crop

prime computer inc today announced a second round 
of layoffs involving 1200 employees over the next six months part 
of its realignment following the acquisition last year of 
computervision corp 
the layoffs about half involving massachusetts employees add to 
the reduction of 700 employees announced two months after 
natickbased prime completed its 435 million takeover of 
computervision in february 
the latest layoffs combined with a restructuring of its 
operations are expected to result in savings of approximately 50 
million in 1989 anthony l craig prime president and chief 
executive officer said in a statement 
these savings will be in addition to the approximately 50 
million in annual operating cost reductions from our continuing 
integration of computervision and should measurably increase 
primes operating income in 1989 and beyond he said 
prime spokesman joe gavaghan said the 1200 layoffs will begin 
jan 3 and continue over the first two quarters of 1989 
generally they are going to be across all organizations he 
said with the largest impact on home office marketing and support 
and the fewest reductions in primes direct sales force 
we are talking worldwide gavaghan said of the layoffs 
although we expect that more than 50 percent of the reductions 
will occur in massachusetts 
about 5000 of primes current workforce of about 12400 are 
employed in massachusetts at prime operations in natick bedford and 
framingham prime also has oversees operations in the united 
kingdom australia france germany and italy 
gavaghan called the layoffs part of a continuation of the 
consolidation process resulting from our merger last year with 
computervision obviously you dont take two companies of our 
respective sizes and do that overnight 
he said the layoffs would effect both former computervision 
employees and pretakeover prime employees as did the previously 
announced reduction of 700 workers we are really not using those 
designations anymore he said our view right now is they are 
all prime employees 
prime will also continue its attrition program he said but we 
dont want to create the inference that the layoffs may be less 
because of attrition cavaghan said that would probably be a 
false expectation 
the layoffs were announced today as part of a realignment plan 
that will place primes field sales and service operations into 
three geographic business units with separate profitandloss 
responsibility and further consolidate its marketing engineering 
manufacturing and adminstration operations 
a statement from the company said that the reorganization plan 
together with other expenses associated with fighting the tustin 
califbased mai basic four incs hostile takeover attempt will 
result in a nonrecurring charge to primes operating earnings for 
its fourth quarter and fiscal year ending dec 31 
the charge is expected to range from 40 million to 45 million 
on a pretax basis prime said

when onethird of the roof peeled off an aloha 
airlines jet flying at 24000 feet eight months ago it stunned the 
aviation community it could not happen aircraft engineers and 
safety investigators said 
but it did and the aloha incident and others like it are 
changing longheld views on how well jetliners age 
in october a large crack was found on a continental airlines 
jet and on monday a 14inch hole opened up at 31000 feet on an 
aging eastern airlines boeing 727 
a flight attendant was swept to her death in the aloha incident 
but everyone else survived as the pilots of the stricken boeing 737 
were able to land it safely the crack on the continental jet was 
found before it posed any danger and the eastern jet landed safely 
after an emergency descent and landing at charleston wva without 
any significant injuries 
eastern airlines said today that a crack was found in the 
fuselage of another one of its 727s in roughly the same area 
where the hole tore open in the first plane monday eastern 
officials in boston said the boeing 727 was grounded for repairs at 
logan international airport after company inspectors discovered the 
3inch crack in the fuselage monday night 
but in scotland british investigators said today that a bomb 
caused the breakup of an 18yearold pan american world airways 
jumbo jet last week 
it is an axiom in the aviation industry that an old jetliner is 
not necessarily an unsafe jetliner but the eastern incident 
perhaps the pan am tragedy and the aloha and continental incidents 
earlier have prompted federal regulators and the industry not to 
mention the flying public to ponder the question when is an 
airplane too old to fly safely 
since l979 the average age of the aircraft fleet belonging to 
the major airlines has increased from 1028 years to 1253 years 
according to avmark inc an aircraft consulting and appraisal firm 
it is estimated that there are about 2300 jetliners in service that 
were built before l968 
the commercial jetliner fleet has grown older as airline 
executives seeing fuel prices drop have chosen to keep their 
fuel guzzling geriatric jets a little longer willing to accept the 
need for added maintenance costs 
a new jet can cost from 30 million to 100 million or more 
depending on the model 
while an aircraft might be old some have undergone extensive 
overhauls 
pan am spokesman jeffrey kriendler said the boeing 747 that 
crashed last wednesday although 18 years old and the 15th off the 
boeing assembly line had undergone extensive modifications and 
strengthening as recently as midl987 as a result he said the 
airplane comes out almost brand new 
likewise eastern not long ago decided to overhaul its older 
boeing 727s instead of replacing them there were indications in 
fact that the crack that became a hole monday on eastern flight 257 
may have occurred at a location where there had been repairs 
concern about aging aircraft is not new in l983 the government 
began to require that older aircraft be subject to special 
inspections and increased maintenance the program covers more than 
1000 jetliners including boeing 727s 737s and 747s as well as 
mcdonnell douglas dc9s and dc8s 
as a plane ages you should start to expect to see some more 
damage occur through fatigue and corrosion says ben cosgrove 
a vice president for engineering at boeing boeing is about to 
conclude an extensive examination of 69 older jets belonging to 43 
airlines in 24 countries 
preliminary results show that most of the 69 aircraft are in 
excellent condition although in some cases they are below 
expectation the aircraft manufacturer observed recently 
the aircraft industry and the federal aviation administration 
believe that as long as old aircraft are closely monitored and 
subject to increased maintenance they will perform safely 
but critics have suggested more is needed and since the aloha 
incident last april many industry experts have begun to agree 
in some cases modification of the aircraft is needed not 
just added inspection said cosgrove acknowledging that this 
view represents a change in industry thinking 
nobody wants anymore alohas cosgrove said as a result of 
its recent survey of older aircraft boeing has suggested that a 
modification or replacement of parts be made part of the routine 
maintenance program after an aircraft has reached a certain age even 
if there is no specific problem noticeable 
in perhaps the first official reflection of this new attitude 
the faa in october directed the replacement of 7200 rivets on every 
older boeing 737 jetliner to guard against a possible repeat of the 
aloha accident 
the directive came three weeks after workers at continental 
airlines discovered a footlong crack on an aging continental boeing 
737 during a routine repainting job the crack apparently had not 
been noticed before even though that aircraft had been among those 
subject to special scrutiny because of its age

federal regulators today announced plans to 
rescue the countrys largest insolvent savings and loan institution 
in a bailout that could cost the government 17 billion and a 
separate 51 billion aid package to help save five troubled texas 
institutions 
in the first case the federal home loan bank board said it had 
completed an agreement for the sale of american savings and loan 
association of stockton calif to an investment group headed by 
texas billionaire robert m bass 
according to the details of the sale the bank board which 
regulates the countrys 3100 savings and loans will inject as much 
as 17 billion in federal aid 
as costly as the american savings bailout will turn out to be it 
was dwarfed by the announcement concerning the texas institutions 
the bank board said it will provide 51 billion in government 
assistance over the next 10 years to assist in the takeover of five 
of the most financially troubled texas institutions 
the texas sampls are being taken over by the investment group of 
macandrews amp forbes holding inc which is headed by ronald o 
perelman the takeover specialist who is the head of revlon inc 
the cosmetics company 
as costly as the rescue packages will be bank board chairman m 
danny wall said that the cost to the government of simply closing 
the insolvent institutions and paying off depositors would have been 
far higher 
in the case of the california institution wall estimated the 
cost of closing the institution and paying off depositors would have 
cost the insurance fund the federal savings and loan insurance 
corp 33 billion compared to a cost of 17 billion for the sale 
to the bass group 
with todays actions the government has resolved the case of 181 
failed sampls this year up from 48 last year 
wall said today that he still expects to meet his estimate of 
settling 200 cases before the end of the year 
the board is rushing to complete transactions because tax breaks 
for institutions getting government assistance will be reduced after 
jan 1 
the purchase agreement for american savings the countrys second 
largest sampl and the biggest one that was classified insolvent will 
require the bass group to invest 350 million in cash and add 
another 150 million over the next three years 
in return the government will provide an estimated 17 billion 
in financial aid 
todays announcement culminates months of negotiations between 
the bank board and the bass group 
in a statement bass said i am delighted that our months of 
hard work with the bank board and its staff have resulted in a new 
start for american savings the employees and customers of american 
savings can start the new year knowing that they are now associated 
with one of the healthiest institutions in the country 
more than 400 insolvent thrifts remain open and hundreds more are 
close to insolvency 
estimates of the cost of cleaning up the industry range from 50 
billion made by the bank board to 112 billion the recent 
estimate by the general accounting office the auditing arm of 
congress 
even with the rapid pace of rescues in recent week analysts say 
the problem is getting worse by more than 1 billion a month 
congress is planning to begin considering a taxpayer bailout of 
fslic when it convenes in january

a private group has committed 315 million to 
acquire five insolvent texas thrifts as part of a 51 billion 
package the largest us savings and loan bailout ever federal 
regulators said today 
the federal home loan bank board prior to the acquisition 
placed all five institutions into receivership the consolidation 
forms the states largest savings and loan institution and its 
fourth largest financial firm said the board 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp will provide a 
package worth 51 billion to assist the consolidation said david 
colgren a board spokesman he said no taxpayer funds are involved 
the money comes from the fslic insurance fund created from 
assessments on savings and loans 
george barclay president and principal supervising agent federal 
home loan bank of dallas described the deal as the largest such 
bailout in the nation barclay said taxpayers wont directly be 
affected by fslics action 
the previous single largest transaction under the socalled 
southwest plan was the august consolidation of eight insolvent 
thrifts including sunbelt savings into a new sunbelt savings that 
deal included a 25 billion cash infusion by fslic 
the 2yearold southwest plan was devised by federal thrift 
regulators as a way to deal with the savingsandloan crisis 
centered in texas with its energy and real estate slump 
also today the bank board said it had completed an agreement for 
another takeover the sale of american savings and loan association 
of stockton calif to an investment group headed by texas 
billionaire robert m bass that deal totals as much as 17 billion 
in fslic funds 
investors in the 51 billion takeover are banker gerald j ford 
chairman of ford bank group in dallas along with macandrews and 
forbes holdings inc of new york a private investment group whose 
chairman is ronald o perelman according to a board statement 
the savings and loans being acquired are first texas savings 
association and montfort federal savings and loan association both 
in dallas gibraltar savings association and home savings and loan 
association both in houston and killeen savings and loan 
association in killeen 
the former offices of the five thrifts opened today as branches 
of first texas bank fsb and the consolidation should cause no 
interruption to depositors the agency said 
bank board officials said gibraltar with assets of 61 billion 
and first texas with 35 billion in assets are among the states 
largest sampls the five thrifts have combined assets of 122 billion 
as far as the daytoday operations i want to assure you no 
changes will take place except for the name on the door ford said 
at a news conference overnight we first texas are healthy and 
strong and everyone will benefit from this fresh start he said 
m danny wall bank board chairman said the 315 million in the 
deal announced today is the largest capital infusion by any 
purchaser under the southwest plan 
the plan has attracted more than 800 million in new capital to 
texas thrifts this year and that level is quickly approaching the 
billiondollar mark wall said 
this demonstrates that there is a viable interest in texas 
thrifts and investors are confident enough in the future of the 
thrift industry that they are willing to invest hundreds of millions 
of dollars in texas thrifts 
seventy insolvent texas thrifts have been merged into 12 under 
the southwest plan to date 
the transaction was one of several in a lastminute spree of 
southwest plan deals expected for this week regulators and 
purchasers are racing to finish by midnight saturday when tax 
benefits that lower the costs of the purchases expire 
federal regulators are continuing to meet with potential 
acquirers said colgren the chairman had said he hoped that we 
could resolve somewhere between 15 and 35 thrifts in texas by 
yearend and we are at 20 
clearly we continue to meet with acquirers in constructing the 
best transactions that balance the needs of the fslic and private 
industry

the agriculture department proposed on 
wednesday to reduce import restrictions on shipments of british 
swine pork and pork products to the united states 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said the proposal is a result of 
britains eradication of hog cholera a contagious and sometimes 
fatal disease of swine he said no case of the disease has been 
reported since august 1987 
the restriction currently require that pork and pork products be 
cooked heated or cured and dried before being shipped from britain 
to ensure that disease organisms were destroyed 
under the proposed rule change small quantities of untreated 
pork and pork products for personal consumption will be allowed to 
enter the united states from britain however commercial shipments 
must orginate only from plants which meet us requirements 
glosser said the proposal would affect some us swine producers 
who have expressed a desire to import swine breeding stock or semen 
from britain however he said these expected shipments would not 
have an impact on us swine production 
the proposal will be open for public comments until feb 27 
after which the department will make a final decision

rudolph giuliani once said he understood how a 
police officer could take a 1000 bribe to supplement his salary 
what i do not understand is how a guy whos already got a 
million dollars defrauds for another hundred thousand or trades 
information so his firm can make another 3 million instead of 2 
million said manhattans us attorney that i do not 
understand at all 
dont get him wrong giuliani is equally willing some would say 
eager to prosecute cops and ceos mafioso bosses and miss americas 
but as he winds up 5 years as prosecutor in the nations busiest 
courthouse giuliani has perhaps become best known as the eliot ness 
of the financial markets the humorless lawman who put inside trader 
ivan boesky out of business and frightened junkbond financier 
drexel burnham lambert inc into a record 650 million plea bargain 
for securities fraud 
im sure that there are those who think that im a zealot who 
doesnt have a real appreciation of the way the marketplace 
operates giuliani said and there are those who think im doing 
a good job that im straightening out a systemic problem that 
others havent confronted 
there are many who think that a barrage of highprofile cases 
have put the 44yearold brooklyn native in a perfect position to 
run for office 
giuliani wont discuss the matter though he says he will leave 
his job shortly in the aftermath of the bess myerson divorcefixing 
trial a rare defeat he was asked whether the acquittal of the 
former miss america beauty queen would hurt him politically he 
dismissed the question as irrelevant 
giuliani was an assistant us attorney in the manhattan office 
in the 1970s it was he who convinced new york city detective robert 
leuci to admit to crimes committed with his partners thus opening 
up the city police scandal that was dramatized in the film prince 
of the city 
two tours at the justice department in washington followed 
separated by four years in private practice in 1983 he was 
associate attorney general for criminal prosecutions the 
thirdranking position in the department 
then though it appeared to be a demotion he took the new york 
job this is a job i always wanted to do he said 
in short order giuliani became the towns most talked about 
federal prosecutor since thomas dewey made a name for himself 
busting racketeers in the 1930s 
he personally prosecuted the first case to come out of the citys 
corruption scandals the trial that resulted in the convictions of 
bronx democratic boss stanley friedman and others 
he went after organized crime artfully using racketeering 
statutes to convict the heads of all five of new yorks crime 
families in the pizza connection case his office broke open a 
huge ring that distributed heroin 
in fact when giuliani turned his attention to the financial 
world the wall street journal offered every encouragement for him 
to make his name pursuing the mafia rather than trying to expand the 
law of insider trading 
giuliani defends the insider trading cases at the margins he 
says the law may be nebulous but the cases his office brought we 
believe constitute the most egregious core of insider trading 
dennis levine was the first major target the former managing 
director of drexel burnham lambert pleaded guilty to charges of 
securities fraud tax evasion and perjury and was sentenced to two 
years in prison after admitting he made millions by trading on 
secret information about corporate takeovers 
levine fingered boesky the speculator pleaded guilty to 
conspiring to make false statements to the securities and exchange 
commission received a threeyear sentence and agreed to cooperate 
with prosecutors 
there were other indictments pleas and dealcutting leading to 
drexel burnhams historic plea bargain on dec 21 after an intensive 
twoyear investigation of the nations fifthlargest securities 
firm it agreed to pay 650 million in fines and restitution and 
plead guilty to six felony counts 
giulianis success was such that he once was offered the top post 
at the sec he turned it down 
but there have been missteps as well in february 1987 federal 
agents swooped into the offices of two major wall street firms and 
seized three executives charging them with insider trading the 
charges were later dropped and though giuliani said they would be 
reinstituted they never were 
that incident according to giulianis critics is typical of the 
prosecutors craving for publicity they say he cares more about 
media attention than about justice they point to the the occasion 
when giuliani and sen alfonse damato disguised themselves as 
lowlifes bought drugs in upper manhattan and then held a news 
conference 
lawyers in the myerson case in which she and boyfriend carl 
capasso were acquitted of conspiring with a judge to have capassos 
alimony reduced say miss myersons fame inspired the case 
had it not been bess myerson giuliani would have never brought 
this case said capasso lawyer jay goldberg it was no good from 
the start 
giuliani denies that prosecution takes a back seat to publicity 
in his office he points to the bottom line prosecutors in the 
southern district of new york have won 90 percent of their cases 
during his watch

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
lower in light volume wednesday on the chicago board of trade 
pulled down by late weakness in the soybean oil market 
traders said heavy buying of soybeans and soybean meal by cargill 
inc helped keep those markets from falling even further in sympathy 
with soybean oil 
after opening lower in reaction to badly needed rainfall in the 
brazilian soybean country the grain and soybean markets steadied 
and turned mixed on technical factors 
soybeans for delivery in january traded as high as 799 a bushel 
but buying enthusiasm faded when traders failed to push the price 
through resistance at 8 
i think thats the fifth time weve tried to get through and 
couldnt said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter 
reynolds inc in chicago 
the oil sold off sharply late and the weakness in the oil just 
pulled the whole thing down he said 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 435 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
lower to 2 cents higher with march at 283 a bushel oats were 2

ale and carol janssen have a home where 
the buffalo roam 
a pen behind their house in pinckney is home to 11 of the shaggy 
critters who once thundered across the american plains another 11 
graze at their 200acre farm in kalkaska further north 
these reminders of the old west are not for show theyre for 
supper said janssen who now eats buffalo instead of beef and 
markets what he doesnt eat 
the supply is low and demand is great theres not enough in 
existence janssen said 
the public is acquiring a taste for buffalo the janssens say 
it tastes like a good grade of beef mrs janssen said 
noting buffalo meat is lower in fat and higher in protein than beef 
if somebody would give it to you and didnt tell you youd say 
this is delicious 
janssen said he got into the buffalo business in 1976 with three 
animals he ordered after seeing a herd near sterling colo by 1991 
he plans to have a herd of 60 
the grassgrazing animals need less care than cattle but require 
more caution because of their size he said the bull in his herd is 
six feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 2600 pounds 
they do dominate their aens raise the buffalo for slaughter a 
6monthold calf has become mrs janssens friend 
the 200pound calf called charlie was born with a fractured hip 
and was cared for by michigan state university veterinary students 
for a month when he was returned to his mother the cow rejected 
him so mrs janssen feeds him goats milk from a bottle 
although young charlie someday will tip the scales at 1600 
pounds or more for now he nuzzles mrs janssen and tries to lick 
her face 
the janssens are among 45 michigan farmers who are members of the 
national buffalo association according to kim dowling editor of 
the groups buffalo magazine 
michigan is home to more than 1000 privately owned buffalo she 
said 
huge herds once crisscrossed the plains but the numbers of the 
beasts had shrunk to 540 in the late 1800s dowling said public 
concern over the future of the creatures prompted state and federal 
parks to begin building herds in the 1920s and 1930s she said 
americans began raising buffalo for slaughter in the 1950s and 
now 60000 are held in private herds nationwide dowling said 
another 20000 belong to public herds at state and federal public 
parks 
the national buffalo association claims about 1000 members 
nationwide dowling said including 37 restaurants that feature 
buffalo on their menus 
one of those is dominiques in washington which offers buffalo 
sausage with fresh mushrooms and bordelaise sauce as an appetizer 
for 795 
people arent afraid of it ns she said 
janssens buffalo end up in the meat case at janssens party 
store in owendale mich run by his brother george 
one buffalo yields at least 800 pounds of burgers steaks and 
roasts said audene janssen georges wife ground buffalo sells for 
339 a pound she said 
the associations magazine reports sale prices of buffalo which 
carol janssen said the family uses as a guide in setting the price 
for the meat they sell 
janssen said hes yet to turn a profit on his herd and wont be 
able to make a living from buffalo until his herd grows 
in the meantime janssen said the animals are a minitourist 
attraction with passersby stopping to photograph them 
when they get to running and jumping and the children start to 
laugh that makes it all worthwhile he said

federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
said wednesday that last years historic stock market crash was an 
accident waiting to happen but quick centralbank action softened 
its impact 
history teaches us that central banks have a crucial role to 
play in responding to such episodes of acute financial distress 
he said in prepared remarks to the american economic association 
greenspan said that before the federal reserve system was founded 
75 years ago interest rates rose sharply and credit availability was 
greatly curtailed during stock market crashes or their 
equivalent 
these high rates were a product of natural market reactions 
to the dramatic increases in uncertainty that accompanied such 
episodes he said 
but greenspan said after the oct 19 1987 stock market crash 
the fed clearly managed to shrink irrational reactions in the 
financial system to an irreducible minimum by adding liquidity to 
the financial system for the next two weeks 
rather than the spikes in rates observed in panics earlier in 
our history shortterm rates actually declined after october 19 
even on private instruments greenspan said 
greenspan said the fed still kept a watchful eye on inflation 
being cautious to attack the problem that existed and not cause 
one that didnt 
a central issue through all the turmoil of 14 months ago and 
since has been the cause of the market collapse and especially the 
reasons for its suddeness he said 
undoubtedly he said the crash will provide raw material for a 
steady flow of doctoral dissertations for years to come 
greenspan said the crash was brought about by overbought market 
conditions and computerized program trading a strategy enabling 
institutional investors to make lightningquick trades of huge 
amounts of stocks and index futures to profit from price disparities 
something had to snap greenspan said if it didnt happen 
in october it would have happened soon thereafter the market 
plunge was an accident waiting to happen

quantum chemical corp which has undertaken a 
series of steps to increase the value of its stock over the past 
year on wednesday announced the latest move a 11 billion 
recapitalization plan that includes a onetime 50pershare 
dividend 
the news sent quantums shares soaring on wall street as 
investors rushed to take advantage of the dividend to be paid jan 
10 quantum stock rose 1862 a share to 10712 in new york stock 
exchange composite trading 
quantum said its board of directors approved the recapitalization 
and dividend as well as plans to sell the companys oleochemicals 
business proceeds of the sale were to go toward the cost of the 
recapitalization the company said in a statement 
quantum chairman john hoyt stookey said the recapitalization was 
designed to unlock value for our shareholders while allowing 
quantum to continue a 13 billion capital expenditure plan 
a source close to the company said the recapitalization was not 
being undertaken as a defensive move 
fred siemer a chemical industry analyst with chemical research 
said the company has had a policy of trying to maximize 
shareholder value ever since stookey took over and that the 
announcement was consistent with that policy 
siemer said he was unaware of any possible bids for the company 
but said in todays takoever climate thats always possible 
the company which changed its name to quantum chemical a year 
ago from national distillers and chemical corp sold off its wine 
and spirits business including brands such as gilbeys gin and 
almaden wines to focus on its chemical and energy segments 
the asset sales were part of the companys plans to increase the 
value of its stock siemer said 
the company also increased the value of its shares following the 
october 1987 wall street crash by buying back approximately 
onethird of its outstanding stock 
the company now has 228 million outstanding shares 
quantum said it would finance the recapitalization through 115 
billion in bridge loans that would be repaid partly through 
publiclyoffered debt securities and bank loans totaling nearly 900 
million 
additionally the company said its employee stock ownership plan 
would borrow 100 million to purchase quantum shares 
quantums main businesses include petrochemicals and propane 
marketing

centaur partners said wednesday it would press 
ahead with its spurned 765 million takeover bid for pennwalt corp 
while the chemical makers management denounced the pursuers and 
their investment banker as greedy wall street raiders 
in a statement the partnership said it still sought a meeting 
with pennwalt executives to discuss a friendly merger 
on tuesday the philadelphiabased companys board called 
centaurs 100ashare offer completely unacceptable 
pennwalt listed several reasons for the rejection including the 
success of the firms restructuring program and its future 
prospects the board also considered the large number of 
significant uncertainties in the centaur offer the statement said 
in a letter to pennwalt shareholders chairman edwin e tuttle 
called centaurs offer illusory and said it was not intended 
to succeed he said centaur only wanted to realize a shortterm 
profit 
tuttle issued a further statement late wednesday reiterating the 
companys determination not to negotiate with centaur and he 
rebuked painewebber inc for providing financing for the 
partnerships bid 
it is unfortunate that the greed on wall street has led a 
onceprominent investment banking firm like painewebber to join in 
partnership with the likes of these people tuttle said 
earlier wednesday centaur accused tuttle of resorting to 
namecalling 
despite mr tuttles assertions our offer is intended to 
succeed centaur said 
centaur whose principals are new york financiers abbey j butler 
and melvyn j estrin owns 127 percent of pennwalts outstanding 
shares 
the partners said they wanted to meet with tuttle and other 
pennwalt officers to consummate a merger that is beneficial to 
pennwalt and its shareholders to avoid costly and protracted 
litigation and to demonstrate our comitment to acquriing pennwalt 
centaur was referring to litigation brought by pennwalt to block 
the bid

platinum futures prices fell more than 20 an ounce wednesday on 
the new york mercantile exchange but analysts said the plunge was 
due more to thin trading conditions than to bearish 
supplyanddemand developments 
futures prices of other precious metals also declined 
on other markets coffee futures rebounded from tuesdays steep 
losses grains soybeans and energy futures were mostly lower 
livestock and meat futures were mixed and stockindex futures 
advanced 
platinum settled 1990 to 2240 lower with the contract for 
delivery in january at 51050 a troy ounce 
platinum futures had been mostly on the rise since dec 19 the 
last day of a 3day collapse sparked by ford motor cos 
announcement of a platinumfree catalytic converter the use of 
platinum in the automobile pollutioncontrol devices accounts for 
about a third of world platinum consumption 
the ford announcement continues to overhang the market and 
wednesdays strength in the dollar was a bearish signal for all the 
precious metals some analysts said 
but they agreed that platinums losses wednesday were exaggerated 
by thin holiday market conditions a simple lack of enough traders 
to provide much resistance to sharp price swings 
trading was very light across the board and it was particularly 
light in platinum as is usually the case said bette raptopoulos 
an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
confidence appeared to have been building in the platinum market 
following assurances from platinum producers that fords new 
converter would not significantly reduce demand for the metal for 
several years 
but the recent rally totaling about 15 an ounce was a rather 
fragile recovery said peter cardillo an analyst with josephthal 
amp co in new york 
cardillo said wednesdays plunge left the platinum market 
technically vulnerable to further losses with no strong resistance 
likely above 503 an ounce 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 410 to 480 
lower with february at 41660 a troy ounce silver was 61 cents to

exchange on rumors that a financially troubled brazilian exporter 
would fail to meet shipping commitments said kim badenhop an 
analyst with merrill lynch capital markets inc 
coffee futures hit a 2year high of 159 a pound last week but 
prices fell sharply on tuesday following reports of drenching rain 
in the droughtstricken brazilian coffee country 
badenhop the coffee price outlook remained bullish despite the 
rain 
the rain will not increase prospects for the crop he said 
if anything it will just stabilize the losses 
coffee settled 375 cents to 577 cents higher with march at 
15204 a pound 
grain and soybean futures prices ended mostly lower in light 
volume on the chicago board of trade pulled down by late weakness 
in the soybean oil market 
but sales announced after the close of 600000 metric tons of 
both soybean meal and corn to the soviet union should ensure a 
higher opening on thursday traders said 
besides those sales the agriculture department announced sales 
of 100000 metric tons of meal and 200000 metric tons of corn to 
unknown destinations which probably meant the soviets observers 
said 
the corn is no big deal but thats a lot of meal said victor 
lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago i

ownership of a northcentral washington lumber 
and plywood mill was turned over to its 635 workers wednesday after 
union representatives corporate officials and financiers meeting in 
new york closed a 50 million employee buyout deal 
oh man just like a dream came true an impossible dream came 
true said lloyd groomes business manager for local 3023 of the 
lumber plywood and industrial workers union which initiated the 
buyout effort last summer 
weve been given a great gift this christmas the gift of 
opportunity the chance to control our economic destiny groomes 
said 
the employees beat out several fortune 500 companies in 
purchasing omak wood products from international financier sir james 
goldsmith who had acquired the mill in 1985 as part of his purchase 
of crown zellerbach co 
this proves that employees can obtain the financing necessary 
to acquire profitable companies said fred mccarthy a managing 
director for drexel burnham lambert inc the investment firm that 
represented the union in negotiations with goldsmith 
mccarthy said the omak buyout is the first in which workers buy a 
healthy company maintain a majority ownership and use a significant 
amount of highyield highrisk junk bonds for financing 
weve had employee buyouts of sick companies and of healthy 
companies with financing from banks but none i can think of in 
which those three elements of majority ownership a healthy company 
and more financing than banks could provide are combined he said 
the employees will own almost 60 percent of the new company 
through an employee stock ownership plan goldsmith retained a 10 
percent share to make the purchase price easier and as a show of 
faith in the employee plan said al dunlap president and chief 
executive officer of goldsmiths operations 
the rest of the stock will be owned by investors 
drexel will act as private placement agent for about 50 million 
required to buy the company and to provide working capital 
washington gov booth gardner in a statement from his olympia 
office congratulated the workers and pledged continued state 
support to help the venture succeed

manufacturers in japan taiwan and south korea are setting unfairly 
low prices on their smallbusiness phone equipment marketed in the 
united states

an average 75 percent higher than their prices in the us market 
and in one case 170 percent higher 
the petition involves equipment for small businesses with two to 
80 phone lines the two major types are known as key systems and 
private branch exchanges or pbxs atampts general business systems 
is the largest us manufacturer of these products 
the commerce department has 20 days in which to decide whether to 
investigate atampts charges if it initiates an investigation the 
international trade commission will begin a separate probe to 
determine whether the alleged dumping has harmed the us 
industry and will make a preliminary finding within 45 days 
final determinations by both the department and the commission 
and possible imposition of antidumping duties would occur in about 
a year

american savings emerged from a federal 
bailout wednesday propped up by 17 billion in government 
insurance forbidden to put much of its wealth into aggressive 
investments and run by a conservative thrift industry veteran 
the federal home loan bank board sold american the nations 
secondbiggest thrift to the robert m bass group of fort worth 
texas for 350 million cash 
the investment group promised to inject at least 150 million 
more into the insolvent thrift over the next three years and the 
bank board agreed to supply up to 17 billion in federal aid from 
the industryfinanced insurance fund the federal savings amp loan 
insurance corp 
the new institution with a federal charter is called american 
savings bank 
american insolvent and burdened with debt blamed on overly 
aggressive expansion and risky realestate loans and direct 
investments was seized by the bank board in september from its old 
owner financial corp of america 
the board kept the bank open through tortuous negotiations with 
bass running 186 branches in california and has tried to retain 
customers by guaranteeing deposits even beyond the normal 100000 
fslic insurance limit 
one facet of the agreement represents a setback of sorts for the 
bass group which had sought permission to put up to 10 percent of 
americans assets into a socalled merchant bank which could fund 
corporate takeovers 
that plan drew fire from state regulators elected officials and 
thrift executives who maintained that it was americans aggressive 
management that got the company into trouble in the first place 
the merchant bank idea has been replaced the bank board said 
with permission to put up to 3 percent of the companys assets in a 
subsidiary called stockton capital corp that will be allowed to buy 
or invest in profitable companies 
apparently in return for concessions from bass on the merchant 
bank the bank board reduced the amount of cash the investor group 
must initially pump into american to 350 million from 550 million 
the new institution is run by mario antoci formerly 
secondincommand at hf ahmanson the nations biggest thrift 
holding company and one generally described by analysts as 
conservative and wellrun 
antoci 54 was named chairman and chief executive officer of new 
american holdings inc the new basscontrolled holding company for 
the thrift 
his appointment was greeted in the industry as a signal bass 
intends to run american along traditional thrift lines focusing on 
home mortgages 
hes a good conservative banker said an approving william 
callender president and chief executive officer of california 
federal savings amp loan association 
it appears to send a signal to the market that the institution 
is going to be run in a conservative and traditional fashion 
added bob adelizzi president of san diegobased home federal 
savings amp loan i think that bodes well for americans future 
health 
the rescue plan outlined wednesday by the government and the bass 
group splits american into two institutions 
a socalled good bank called american savings bank will run 
the branches and oversee the loans and investments that continue to 
make money a bad bank called new west federal savings amp loan 
association was formed specifically to sell off foreclosed loans 
unprofitable real estate investments and other bad assets 
the good bank will have assets of 157 billion making it 
the sixthlargest sampl in the country with 301 billion in assets 
the old american was the nations secondbiggest thrift behind 
ahmansons home savings of america 
the old holding company financial corp of america is being 
liquidated in bankruptcy court and trustee david gill has said it 
is likely stockholders in fca will lose their entire investments 
headquarters for the new holding company remain in irvine and the 
savings and loan will continue to be run out of stockton

eastern airlines on wednesday said an inspection of 
46 older boeing 727s found one with a 3inch fuselage crack in 
roughly the same spot as a tear that forced a jet to make an 
emergency landing in charleston wva 
the plane was grounded at bostons logan international airport 
and later wednesday eastern maintenance workers in miami found 
apparent corrosion near rivets on another 727 company spokeswoman 
karen ceremsak said she said paint was being removed from the area 
late wednesday and no other details were available 
apparent cracks were found in an outofservice eastern dc9 in 
atlanta ms ceremsak said that discovery was not related to the 
boeing 727 inspection but resulted from an earlier industrywide 
directive from the federal aviation administration and 
mcdonnelldouglas the manufacturers to check all dc9 aircraft 
with 55000 flights she said 
an faa official said airlines soon will be asked to replace 
rivets in more than 800 727s that were made with what is now 
considered an outmoded bonding process 
darrell pederson an faa assistant manager in seattle where 
boeing is based said the agency was very close to issuing a 
notice of proposed rulemaking which can be followed by an 
airworthiness directive after some time for public comment 
a similar directive was issued after a 20foot section tore loose 
from an aloha airlines 737 jet in midflight in april sending a 
flight attendant to her death pederson said 
under that directive airlines had to replace more than 7000 
rivets on at least 100 older boeing 737s at a cost of about 8 
million in addition altitude and other restrictions were imposed 
pending inspection for cracks 
eastern ordered its 727s to be checked visually as a precaution 
after the emergency landing monday morning a 14inch hole opened at 
the rear of the cabin roof at 31000 feet causing the 22yearold 
boeing 727 to lose pressure 
the airline also plans a more sophisticated electricalcurrent 
inspection of its boeing fleet well use electrical current 
seeking out any imperfections beginning tonight ms ceremsak 
said this is on our own initiative 
the checks can be carried out during normal maintenance and will 
be completed in about a month without disrupting service she said 
a crack in a 24yearold eastern jet was discovered monday 
eastern said in announcing the visual inspections were completed 
the plane was one of the first 727s made 
that plane was taken out of service for repairs said carrier 
spokesman robin matell all the rest are flying normally 
national transportation safety board inspectors arrived in boston 
on wednesday to examine the plane 
ms ceremsak said the airline anticipates changes in its 
procedures when the ntsb issues its findings on the emergency 
landing of mondays rochestertoatlanta flight two people among 
the 110 aboard suffered minor injuries 
im sure we will be revising our maintenance program in keeping 
with the findings but it would be premature to say what changes we 
will make ms ceremsak said 
in atlanta delta air lines said it plans to inspect the fuselage 
of each of its boeing 727 jets 
delta spokesman jim lundy said the assurancetype inspections 
are being conducted in consultation with boeing and eastern and are 
strictly a precaution delta has experienced no similar problems 
and the airlines 130 boeing 727 jets are all from the newer 727200 
series with an average age of 1176 years he said 
in charleston eastern mechanics on wednesday were set to repair 
the 14by10inch hole in the fuselage some material was to be 
taken to ntsb headquarters in washington for analysis 
some experts have speculated the tear was caused by metal 
fatigue but ms ceremsak said eastern would await the ntsb report 
she said the repaired plane was expected to be flown back to atlanta 
or miami on thursday 
some of the 104 passengers complained that their oxygen masks 
failed to work when the cabin lost pressure but ms ceremsak said 
many of those aboard had failed to pull down on the masks hard 
enough to trigger the oxygen flow 
we went back and tested the masks and they all deployed she 
said 
the emergency landing and grounded plane were just two incidents 
in a string of eastern problems this week 
on sunday an eastern a300 bound for newark nj had to return 
to miami international airport because of an engine problem on 
tuesday a fort lauderdalebound a300 turned back to new yorks 
laguardia airport after a problem with a door prevented the plane 
from being properly pressurized 
also tuesday an eastern plane clipped a parked private plane at 
the key west airport while taxiing and passengers were put on 
another flight

nissan motor corp usa announced wednesday 
that it will raise prices on its 1989 cars and trucks because of the 
increasing strength of the japanese yen against the dollar 
car and truck prices will go up an average of 3 percent or 388 
on jan 4 said robert j thomas vice president and general manager 
of nissan usa 
the automaker had taken several steps to offset the impact of the 
changing exchange rate thomas said 
however the continued weakening of the dollar has forced us to 
raise our prices he said in a news release 
a higher yen makes japanese products more expensive in relation 
to us products and discourages consumers from buying them the 
higher prices help the automaker compensate for slower sales

in two of the largest savings and loan bailouts 
yet federal regulators announced agreements wednesday to provide 
68 billion in government aid to rescue the nations largest 
insolvent sampl and to assist in the takeover of five problem thrift 
institutions in texas 
the rescue packages involved american savings and loan 
association of stockton calif the nations secondlargest sampl and 
the biggest one that is classified as insolvent and a group of five 
of the most troubled sampls in texas 
the texas sampls were being taken over by the investment group of 
macandrews amp forbes holding inc which is led by ronald o 
perelman the takeover specialist who is head of the revlon 
cosmetics firm 
the federal home loan bank board which regulates the nations 
3000 sampls agreed to provide 51 billion in government assistance 
over the next 10 years in return the perelman group agreed to 
contribute 315 million of its own funds to buy the five texas sampls 
the latest texas package represented the second largest amount of 
government aid ever extended it was exceeded only by 55 billion 
in assistance provided in the merger of sunbelt savings association 
and seven other texas institutions last august 
in the other billiondollarplus transaction announced wednesday 
the bank board pledged to provide an estimated 17 billion in 
government assistance over the next three years in the sale of 
american savings to a group headed by texas billionaire robert m 
bass 
the bass group will put up 350 million in cash and add 150 
million over the next three years 
the threemember bank board met late into the night wednesday as 
the agency raced the clock to finish as many deals as possible 
before jan 1 when the tax breaks to the purchasers of insolvent 
sampls are reduced 
in other actions wednesday the bank board said it was providing 
49 million in government assistance in the the takeover of 
the insolvent first federal savings and loan association of 
columbus ga by barnett banks inc of jacksonville fla the bank 
will invest 315 million and operate the sampl as barnett federal 
savings bank 
664 million in government assistance in the takeover of the 
insolvent mclean federal savings and loan of virginia by nvryan 
lp a home construction company which will invest 16 million to 
acquire the sampl the new institution will operate as nvr federal 
savings bank 
596 million in government assistance in the takeover of the 
insolvent first financial savings bank of des moines iowa by 
metropolitan federal bank of iowa which will operate first 
financials 10 offices as branches of metropolitan federal 
the latest transactions wednesday brought to 184 the number of 
failed sampls with which the bank board has dealt this year up from 
48 last year seventy of the institutions have been in texas where 
financial institutions have suffered because of hard times in the 
oil and real estate industries 
so far this year the bank board has pledged in excess of 30 
billion in government assistance with an expectation of several 
more bailout packages before sunday when the new year begins 
bank board chairman m danny wall said regulators were working to 
complete other deals and it was likely the final total for the year 
could reach 200 
the board is rushing to complete transactions because tax breaks 
for the investors getting government assistance will be cut in half 
after jan 1 
private analysts said the size of the latest rescue packages 
served to highlight just how serious a problem is facing the new 
bush administration 
the sampl situation is a disaster and it is not going to get 
better in a hurry said david wyss chief financial economist for 
data resources inc a lexington mass consulting firm this is a 
problem that president bush would be well advised to address fairly 
early 
even with the postdepression record number of cases being 
handled this year more than 400 insolvent sampls remain open and 
hundreds of others are close to insolvency 
estimates of cleaning up the industry range from a low of 50 
billion the current bank board projection to a high of 112 
billion included in the latest report from the general accounting 
office the auditing arm of congress 
analysts said the problem is getting worse by 1 billion a month 
putting even more pressure on the new administration to come up with 
more government aid so that the sick sampls can be dealt with more 
quickly thus easing the final taxpayer tab 
so far the government assistance has come primarily from special 
assessments healthy sampls are required to pay to the federal agency 
that insures individual deposits up to 100000 
however the federal savings and loan insurance corp which is 
an arm of the bank board is itself technically insolvent with its 
obligations to close or merge sick sampls far outweighing the revenue 
stream expected from industry fees 
treasury secretary nicholas brady who will be staying on in the 
bush administration has ordered a study of ways to replenish the 
fslic fund he reportedly is searching for a plan that will minize 
the impact on the federal budget deficit fslic expenditures count 
as federal spending 
thus the growing sampl problem is making bushs campaign pledge to 
trim the budget deficit without resorting to new taxes more 
difficult to meet 
some in congress have been critical of the bank board rescue 
packages charging that the deals fail to attract enough money from 
the investors taking over the failed sampls 
but wall said wednesday that the cost to the government of simply 
closing the insolvent institutions and paying off depositors up to 
the 100000 maximum provided by law would be far more costly 
in the case of the latest texas rescue package wall put the cost 
of closing the institutions and paying off depositors at 68 
billion compared with the 51 billion projected government cost of 
the merger 
in the case of american savings wall said the shutdown cost 
would have been 33 billion almost double the 17 billion the 
government expects to pay out in the sale to the bass group 
the texas institutions involved are first texas savings 
association and montfort federal savings and loan association both 
in dallas gibraltar savings association and home savings and loan 
association both in houston and killeen savings and loan 
association in killeen 
montfort is the former vernon savings and loan association of 
dallas which got into trouble for risky lending practices when the 
bank board took over the institution earlier this year officials 
found that 96 percent of its loans were deliquent or nonperforming 
the former offices of the five sampls opened wednesday as branches 
of first texas bank fsb with no interruption in service to 
depositors

a stockprofiteering scandal has boosted political 
reform to the top of the national agenda but the jury probably will 
be out for months on whether japans money politics will change 
significantly 
prime minister noboru takeshita vowing to tighten political 
discipline formed a new cabinet on tuesday with 15 new members out 
of 20 but the balance of political factions was unchanged and the 
leadership of his liberal democratic party stayed the same even 
though two of the top three party positions are held by men tainted 
by scandal 
media commentators were virtually unanimous in saying the cabinet 
reshuffle did not cure the recruit scandal 
it is regrettable that we cannot feel any hope for a change 
the asahi shimbun editorial said wednesday the newspaper which 
took a leading role in uncovering the scandal noted that many 
prominent politicians who profited by receiving shares in a recruit 
co subsidiary stayed in power 
we are concerned that they will cover for each other in any 
probe of the scandal the paper said 
the affair has tarnished japans international image and the new 
justice minister takashi hasegawa 76 told a news conference 
tuesday that the public was losing confidence in politics business 
and public officials 
for japan to be trusted in the international arena we have to 
start with establishing a trustworthy political system hasegawa 
said 
but within 24 hours hasegawa was revealed to have received 
regular donations from recruit co including a donation in october 
when the scandal was frontpage news every day over 12 years his 
political organization got 46000 from recruit hasegawa confirmed 
in a postmidnight news conference 
the donations to hasegawa were legal and quite different from the 
stock transactions in a recruit subsidiary that put many politicians 
in hot water but the belated revelation showed how wide the recruit 
scandal goes 
the scandal began unfolding last summer with disclosures that the 
founder of the recruit conglomerate hiromasa ezoe sold 
bargainpriced shares in a realestate subsidiary called 
recruitcosmos to politicians or their aides business leaders and 
media figures before the shares were listed 
the purchases often were financed by loans from another recruit 
subsidiary when the shares were listed in october 1986 and the 
price doubled shareholders made taxfree profits of up to 150000 
the transactions were not illegal but it is widely assumed that 
ezoe was seeking business advantage and prestige the astounding 
scope of the scandal brought suspicion of something approaching 
widespread bribery 
former finance minister kiichi miyazawa heads the roster of 17 
politicians and business leaders who resigned in the scandal a 
former recruit official pleaded guilty to trying to bribe an 
opposition parliament member to tone down his investigation 
takeshitas poll ratings are sharply down but his conservative 
party is the most firmly entrenched governing party among the 
capitalist democracies it has been in power since world war ii with 
the exception of 10 months of a socialist cabinet in 194748 
japan has become an economic superpower under the liberal 
democrats who fostered growth helped troubled industries modernize 
and promoted exports the business world has demonstrated its 
gratitude with generous donations 
the resulting money politics caused a huge scandal in the 
1970s in the time of prime minister kakuei tanaka who was convicted 
of taking a 17 million bribe from the us aircraft maker lockheed 
the liberal democrats won 304 of 524 seats in the powerful lower 
house in the 1986 election but they still run scared at election 
time and the political appetite for money keeps growing 
because the electoral system has multipleseat constituencies 
several liberal democrats may run for the same seat and each 
candidate needs lots of money 
politicians also say they are victimized by the japanese custom 
of generous giftgiving they say they need money far beyond their 
salary and expense allowance to give lavishly at constituents 
weddings and funerals 
takeshita who was touched by the scandal when an aide profited 
from recruitcosmos shares told a news conference wednesday he is 
setting goals on improving political ethics 
he said that before next summers election of half of the upper 
house of the diet japans parliament some progress will be made 
and he hoped for more progress in 1990 
the prime minister said reform committees will deal with 
political donations and fundraising parties and they also will 
take a longterm look at the election system 
i support the idea that political reform is at the base of all 
problems he said each politician including myself must always 
take into account an ethical platform if each one takes 
precautions i believe this will be reflected in daily government 
affairs but it is first necessary to create the environment to make 
this possible 
analyst garrett n scalera president of the tokyo institute of 
policy studies said the diet probably will outlaw dubious donations 
like recruitstyle sales of prelisted shares but he thought reform 
would end there 
if youre talking about political reform in the sense of diet 
members not taking money from business or farming organizations 
its really impossible its too radical a reform scalera said in 
an interview 
after the chairman of nippon telegraph and telephone co japans 
huge telephone utility resigned on dec 14 because of links to the 
scandal the countrys four biggest business organizations said the 
recruit affair was causing distrust of the corporate world and 
could damage the free enterprise system 
the business organizations urged their members to take this 
problem seriously as a matter of corporate morality 
but on the political level the liberal democrats control all the 
levers of change the opposition parties are doubly hobbled because 
they lack power in the diet and have figures who profited from 
recruitcosmos shares

suffered a 14inch tear in its upper rear fuselage 
the rule could affect 813 of the triengine jets including about 
620 flown by us carriers those planes were built using an 
adhesive that bonded at room temperature to join fuselage panels 
where the panels were riveted together after 1971 boeing began 
using adhesives that cured under heat which produced a better bond 
airline industry officials said that while they wanted to see the 
proposal before commenting in detail it would be expensive to 
modify the older planes duff said it had not yet been determined 
how many of the older 727s would be covered by the proposal the 
extent of work each would need or how much the work would cost 
stephen hayes spokesman for the air transport association a 
commercial aviation trade organization also said he had no idea of 
the possible cost 
it would be a substantial expense both in terms of doing the 
work and the indirect cost of taking the aircraft out of service 
he said 
obviously well work closely with the faa and do what we have 
to do to keep all of the fleet in extremely safe condition hayes 
said 
duff said the proposal is similar to a proposed rule issued in 
october to require operators of older boeing 737s also made with the 
coldbonding process to replace more than 7000 rivets in each of 
those jets 
that measure has not yet been made final although a public 
comment period ended dec 12 it was drawn up after a 20foot roof 
section blew out of a heavily used aloha airlines 737 flying above 
hawaii last april killing a flight attendant and injuring 61 other 
people 
as with the earlier proposal extensive inspection of the 727s 
would be required duff said details were still being worked out 
including the length of the public comment period before the rule 
would become final 
the october proposal marked a turning point in faa policy since 
it required carriers to correct potential problems in aircraft 
rather than simply inspecting for problems and fixing any trouble 
found 
at the time of the october notice the faa said it was studying 
whether to extend the rule to 727s and to boeing 747 jumbo jets 
duff said wednesday that no decision had been made on whether to 
include 747s 
on monday a 22yearold eastern airlines 727 made an unscheduled 
landing in charleston wva after a rupture depressurized the 
cabin the cause of the blowout is under investigation 
darrell pederson assistant manager for the seattle faa office 
which is in charge of commercial aircraft certification said the 
agency would take another look at the proposed 727 rule in light of 
that incident 
if theres something new here not covered then we will have to 
take some other action he said 
at a national transportation safety board inquiry into the aloha 
accident experts said coldbonded panels were more liable to 
delamination that placed more stress on the rivets which had flat 
heads and were countersunk into the aluminum skin and tended to 
cause tiny cracks where the angle of the rivet changed 
the new faa proposal would replace those rivets with 
buttonhead types which dont have sharp angles 
boeing commercial airplanes spokesman david jimenez said 
wednesday that the company would wait to see the new proposal before 
commenting in detail but he added whatever they decide has to be 
done we will do very simple 
jimenez said the individual operators of the planes are 
responsible for their maintenance but that boeing would offer 
technical support for any modifications
