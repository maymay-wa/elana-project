a man convicted in three date rapes 
involving three women he worked with at a restaurant was sentenced 
tuesday to up to 53 years in prison by a state judge who labeled 
him a sexual predator 
albany county judge w thomas keegan sentenced kenneth smyers 
28 of menands to 17 23 years to 53 years 
smyers was convicted dec 19 of one count each of rape and 
sexual abuse and two counts of sodomy 
before sentencing smyers proclaimed his innocence and asked 
why if he had committed such crimes it had taken the women 
involved so long to come forward and make complaints to authorities 
five women all coworkers at the albanyarea restaurant 
testified that smyers attacked them but some admitted they didnt 
tell authorities until several months later 
the jury acquitted smyers on one count each of rape and 
attempted sexual abuse in attacks on two of the women and of 
attempted rape on the woman he was convicted of sexually abusing 
assistant district attorney veronica dumas who prosecuted 
smyers said the stiff sentence sends a signal that date rape 
is a crime that wont be tolerated in the county 
he was convicted of four violent felonies and that sentence 
projects what those crimes are she said 
the incidents took place between october 1987 and july 1988 
prosecutors said 
according to testimony at smyers trial the attacks occurred 
under differing circumstances one woman said she voluntarily had 
sex with smyers but said a few days later he showed up at her 
apartment and forced himself on her over her objections 
another woman said she allowed smyers to sleep on her couch 
during a snowstorm but ended up having to fight him off he was 
convicted of sexual abuse in that incident 
several of the women said they continued to work and socialize 
with smyers after the incidents 
smyers attorney stephen coffey said he would appeal the 
conviction 
coffey said that smyers had a legitimate argument when he asked 
why it took so long for the women hes accused of attacking to come 
forward 
where were these women all this time why werent they 
saying anything he asked they were educated women why was it 
they were working with him and associating with him and with each 
other and not coming forward

lottor and gilligan entered innocent pleas and were released on 
100000 bond each they are to return to court next week 
lottor faces five courts and gilligan six in the governments 
19count indictment alleging a scheme to steal military secrets and 
phone numbers from the fbi investigation of former philippine

burglary said fbi agent william smith thats what we have 
burglars who came upon equipment that allowed them to go beyond the 
common crime of burglary

consumers weary of oat bran probably 
wont go back to bacon and eggs for breakfast but they may be 
looking for alternatives now that a study has cast doubt on oat 
brans cureall image 
oat bran was a fad anyway and i think the study will be the 
catalyst for the gradual reduction in sales said ron saba a 
food industry analyst with the ohio co an investment firm 
saba said he thought some people would stick with oat bran 
but for some people its going to give them an excuse to trade in 
those oat bran muffins for twinkies he said 
the new england journal of medicine on thursday published 
results of a study that said eating oat bran had no more effect 
than other grains on a persons cholesterol level it said any 
beneficial effect appeared to come from cereals displacing fatty 
foods in the diet 
it contradicts previous studies that found oat bran was able to 
interfere with fat absorption and lower cholesterol thereby 
lowering the chance for heart disease 
not everyone was certain the report would shake the confidence 
of healthconscious consumers 
maybe it takes some of fiery brilliance out of the oat bran 
craze but i dont know if well see any immediate change in 
consumer demand said bonnie rivers an analyst with salomon 
brothers inc i dont think consumers are going to go back to 
eating bacon and eggs for breakfast 
for some consumers whove grown tired of oat bran in everything 
from pretzels and tortilla chips to doughnuts and beer the study 
is just what they wanted to hear 
i started eating oat bran for breakfast every day about a year 
ago after all the hoopla said pat edwards who was choosing 
among the cereals in a grand rapids supermarket thursday night 
quite frankly i was never too crazy about it this is just the 
excuse i was looking for to try something else 
thats just human nature responded quaker oats co 
spokesman ron bottrell people like variety and weve never 
positioned oat bran as a magic bullet or the one food people had to 
eat to see a reduction in their cholesterol 
however quaker which saw sales of oat bran original hot cereal 
go from 1 million pounds in all of 1987 to 2 million pounds per 
month in 1989 has criticized the study saying that its sample was 
too small 20 volunteers and didnt reflect the general 
population 
we dont feel like this one study can negate the 25 years of 
research that preceded it said quaker spokeswoman theresa 
herlevsen this is not going to affect our marketing strategies 
at all 
in 1986 quaker spent a couple of million dollars a year 
advertising its oat bran cereal by 1989 it was spending 50 
million on its hot cereal products much of which was spent on oat 
bran promotion herlevsen said 
analysts say oat bran products have been the fastest growing 
segment of the 65 billion cereal industry 
in battle creek a spokeswoman for kellogg co which makes 
three readytoeat oat bran cereals two of which were introduced 
in the last two years also said the study will not affect 
marketing strategies 
we dont make health claims on our cereal said spokeswoman 
nancy roach weve always promoted our products as being part of 
a balanced diet and we will continue to do so 
analysts say the study may prompt some companies to quit selling 
fringe oatbran products such as potato chips and may stifle the 
introduction of such new products last year 218 products 
containing oat bran were introduced according to gormans new 
product news a chicago newsletter 
things have gotten carried away with it being promoted almost 
like a drug said bob bernstein an analyst with edward d jones 
amp co it almost got to be that oat bran was the beall and 
endall cureall people will always looking for the easy way 
out 
other food companies called attention to the fact that the study 
didnt dispute any effects of soluble fiber found in other foods 
such as fruits vegetables beans and brown rice 
but a recent study at the university of texas was unable to 
duplicate three other studies which found rice bran could affect 
cholesterol levels the rice council of america which paid for the 
study called the results inconclusive

when thomas kaulukukui tells his grandchildren 
of their ancestors who populated these islands and shares 
traditions passed through generations of his family he cant help 
but think they are as hawaiian as he in a world that prizes 
definitions however some do not 
kaulukukui is onehalf hawaiian his three children are 
onequarter and his four grandchildren oneeighth under hawaii 
law only those with 50 percent or more hawaiian blood are 
considered native hawaiians others are termed hawaiians 
my grandchildren ask am i hawaiian or am i not what can i 
tell them kaulukukui said 
the problem is especially troubling for kaulukukui because he is 
chairman of the office of hawaiian affairs an agency established 
by the state to benefit hawaiians those considered natives as 
well as those with any amount of native blood 
by law some oha services are available only to those with 50 
percent or more of hawaiian blood realizing the number of such 
people will continue shrinking because of intermarriage oha is 
making this distinction the subject of a nonbinding referendum 
with thursday the last day for mailing back ballots 
oha is asking descendants of these islands first inhabitants 
whether all those with hawaiian blood should be termed native 
hawaiians and thus entitled to all oha services 
federal programs define native hawaiian as those with any amount 
of hawaiian blood kaulukukui said 
although no precise figure is available it is estimated that 
200000 of hawaiis 1 million residents have at least some hawaiian 
blood as many as 60000 of those have at least 50 percent hawaiian 
blood 
oha receives money from the state and from income derived from 
trust lands turned over to hawaii by the federal government upon 
statehood in 1959 the two sources each provide roughly half ohas 
25 million yearly revenue kaulukukui said 
only those with 50 percent or more hawaiian blood are entitled 
to services funded by the land proceeds but all hawaiians may 
receive statefunded benefits 
we are all one family we shouldnt have this wedge between 
us said state sen mike crozier a supporter of dropping the 
twotiered definition of hawaiian he is onequarter hawaiian 
oha mailed 63000 ballots to voters registered with the agency 
including those with all levels of hawaiian blood 
the ballot asks whether oha voters want to change the definition 
of native hawaiian to all descendants of the indigenous people 
inhabiting the hawaiian islands prior to 1778 when the first 
outsider capt james cook of great britain arrived 
oha will present the referendum results to the 
democratcontrolled legislature where a bill to change the state 
constitution has a good chance of passing if the survey favors 
dropping the twotiered definition of native hawaiian 
such a measure would require a twothirds vote of both houses 
and ratification by the voters crozier said 
oha a semiautonomous agency with a board of trustees elected 
by voters of hawaiian ancestry serves an advocacy role for all 
hawaiians and provides money for educational legal and other 
programs 
kaulukukui said oha programs should not be confused with the 
hawaiian homes act passed by congress in 1920 it allows those 
with 50 percent or more hawaiian blood to lease plots of government 
land for homesteads 
only congress can change that blood requirement kaulukukui said 
kamaki kanahele president of hawaiian homesteaders a state 
council representing hawaiians disagrees with kaulukukui and is 
urging his groups 27000 members to vote against the proposal 
kanahele said he fears congress will take a change in the state 
constitution as a signal to change the blood requirement for the 
homelands program since the homelands program was created some 
6000 homestead leases have been awarded and there are about 19000 
names on the waiting list 
under state law oha is entitled to a 20 percent share of 
proceeds from leases on more than a million acres former crown and 
government land from the time before the overthrow of the hawaiian 
monarchy 
kaulukukui said he hopes enlarging ohas scope of 
responsibilities will persuade state leaders to give the agency a 
greater share of the land trust proceeds

us sen alan cranstons attempts to blame 
former banking regulator edwin j gray for the lincoln savings amp 
loan association debacle were met with a harsh 4000word letter of 
reply 
cranston who is seeking reelection is a desperate 
panicstricken office holder gray wrote monday 
the fact that it happened partially on my watch is as much a 
reflection on your failure yes your unwillingness to help me 
obtain the reforms i sent up to the hill he wrote 
never once sen cranston did you lift a finger to help me 
with the statutory reforms your biggiver friends didnt like 
me or my regulations 
cranston spokesman kam kuwata responded gray claimed he could 
do nothing but he only claims that because he did nothing he 
makes pinnochio look like a piker when it comes to lying about his 
involvement in this scandal 
gray headed the federal home loan bank board when san 
franciscobased federal regulators recommended a takeover of 
irvinebased lincoln on may 1 1987 three weeks after cranston and 
four other senators held their second private meeting with 
regulators gray left office on june 30 1987 
cranston who continues to blame gray for investors losses 
said monday he would introduce legislation allowing the government 
to bail out consumers who lost 200 million on junk bonds purchased 
at lincoln branches 
he said that even though it was technically legal regulators 
should never have allowed lincoln to sell the unsecured bonds 
because investors could easily be led to believe they were 
federally insured 
cranston spoke at the latest in a series of news conferences 
intended to deflect blame aimed at him for the failure of lincoln 
the collapse is expected to cost taxpayers more than 2 billion 
aside from any efforts to repay the junk bond holders 
cranston the senate majority whip is one of five senators 
under investigation by the senate ethics committee for intervening 
with regulators on behalf of lincoln and charles h keating jr 
chief of american continental corp of phoenix lincolns parent 
keating and his family contributed 13 million to the senators 
and their causes 
by focusing on the bondholders cranston hopes to disarm one of 
the most personally damaging allegations against him bondholders 
testimony that his intervention for keating made him partly 
responsible for their losses

a military judge on tuesday 
sentenced an air force maintenance worker to seven years in prison 
and a dishonorable discharge for stealing and selling military 
equipment to undercover fbi agents 
staff sgt chris l london enfield conn pleaded guilty to 20 
charges during a courtmartial monday 
london said he stole the 67432 worth of equipment because he 
needed money to pay bills and child support 
its not an excuse he told air force judge lt col linda 
carter im sorry that it ever happened im glad the government 
property has been returned 
london asked the judge for forgiveness and pleaded for a lenient 
sentence saying lengthy confinement would prevent him from being a 
good father to his son 
carter accepted the guilty pleas and said she wanted to view a 
videotape showing transactions between london and the fbi agents 
before deciding on a sentence she deliberated about one hour 
tuesday and returned with her decision that evening 
london who had faced up to 171 years in military prison 
dishonorable discharge and loss of benefits showed no emotion when 
carter read the sentence 
he was charged in october as a result of operation punchout a 
twoyear fbi sting investigation 
the stolen items included 42 automatic life preserver units 
pilot helmets gloves chin straps camouflage clothing and an 
insect head net 
they were taken from hill air force base between 1986 and 1989 
and sold to a mock military surplus store set up by the fbi in 
nearby roy officials said 
government attorney brian newby of travis air force base in 
california told the judge earlier that london deserved to be put in 
prison for 11 years and receive a dishonorable discharge because he 
disgraced the american flag by lining his pockets with money 
we aim high we expect the best newby said we demand 
the best 
however defense attorney capt george horvath of hill air force 
base said london was remorseful and that financial strains led him 
to commit desperate acts 
the property has been returned intact he said allow him 
the chance to learn and grow from this 
he recommended a twoyear jail sentence 
london 26 was among nearly three dozen military and civilian 
personnel charged in the probe which culminated last july in the 
theft of two f16 jet engines from the base 
two air force security guards admitted stealing the engines and 
will be sentenced friday in us district court 
when the sting was first announced last summer us attorney 
dee benson said it could eventually result in indictments gainst 
more than 100 people the investigation targeted military thefts 
from bases in the west and southwest

the leader of colombias notorious 
medellin cocaine cartel has written to a bogota newspaper saying he 
wants to set them straight on a story he still runs the cartel and 
his friends havent deserted him 
my freedom is the best proof i have to show the country that 
the people are not selling me out and that my friends are neither 
abandoning nor betraying me pablo escobar wrote 
an article monday in el tiempo quoted security force officials 
as saying escobars principal allies were abandoning him as police 
and the military moved in pursuing an allout drug war by the 
government of president virgilio barco escobar wrote on tuesday to 
el tiempo publisher hernando santos castillo saying he was still 
in control of the most powerful drug operation in colombia and that 
it stood together in its decision to seek peace with the government 
the letter carried escobars signature and bore what was 
apparently the imprint of his index finger to prove the document 
was genuine the document was also sent to other news media 
escobar who heads the countrys most wanted list with a 
500000 deadoralive price on his head also said the medellin 
cartel would keep up its war against the rival cali cartel based 
to the south of medellin 
he said jorge valasquez a member of the cali cartel gave 
information to police that resulted in their killing of gonzalo 
rodriguez gacha in a shootout on dec 15 rodriguez gacha was 
escobars close associate and a man considered the most violent of 
the medellin drug lords 
escobar said the entire cartel was behind a peace offer made by 
its leaders last week to barcos government asking for 
constitutional and legal guarantees in exchange for the 
cartels agreeing to give up the cocaine business stop its 
campaign of violence and free its hostages 
the cartel is reckoned to still hold 16 people after freeing 
five recently 
escobars letter indicated the cartel still will demand an end 
to extradition however 
the barco government has packed off 13 trafficking suspects to 
the united states since it intensified its drug war in august the 
drug traffickers replied with a terror campaign that has claimed 
the lives of 209 people and included the bombing a colombian 
airliner 
escobar indicated there was no disagreement within the cartel 
over the peace offer which the government has refused to accept 
saying drug bosses who surrender will have to answer in court for 
their crimes 
his letter read if the colombian government someday decides 
to fight for the peace of our nation in a sovereign and courageous 
way it will find an interminable list of extradition candidates 
drug traffickers hired assassins and paramilitary forces that want 
to join it in the process 
military forces said on tuesday they were taking whatever 
measures were necessary to protect president bush from escobar and 
other drug barons when bush attends an antidrug summit in cartagena 
on feb 15 
us authorities have reportedly said traffickers are preparing 
an attempt on bushs life in the five hours he will be in cartagena 
bush barco president jaime paz zamora of bolivia and possibly 
president alan garcia of peru are to discuss cooperation in the

a judge rejected efforts by a man accused 
of killing his wife mother and three children 18 years ago to bar 
reporters and spectators from pretrial hearings in his murder case 
an attorney for the man authorities say is john e list argued 
that widespread reporting of the case would prejudice potential 
jurors and deny him a fair trial 
but superior court judge william wertheimer on tuesday said 
closing the hearing is offensive to the general public and 
undermines public trust 
wertheimer set march 20 as the first day of jury selection 
the defendant says he is robert p clark who authorities

president bushs pet legislative project a 
cut in the capital gains tax is in trouble again on capitol hill 
even though congressional support seemed to be building at the end 
of last year 
it ran headon into a proposal by sen daniel patrick moynihan 
dny to cut social security taxes the collision could derail 
the bush measure or at least complicate the process 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine once called the 
capital gains cut bushs holy grail 
bush has been pushing the reduction with unabated zeal since 
early in his presidential campaign and in fact since he was a 
junior member of the house ways and means committee during the 
1960s 
the tax on capital gains the profit from the sale of stocks 
real estate and other investments was cut during the mid1970s 
but the major tax code overhaul of 1986 boosted the tax to the same 
rate as other income 28 percent or 33 percent depending on tax 
bracket 
bush associates say the president has a deep repugnance for the 
tax stemming from his oil field business background and honed 
perhaps by his own unpleasant brush with the tax as vice president 
when the internal revenue service rejected his attempt to claim a 
deferral 
when bush sold his familys fivebedroom home in houston in 1981 
for 843273 he claimed a tax deferral on his 596101 capital 
gain because he used the money to buy his family vacation home in 
kennebunkport maine 
but the irs ruled in 1984 that bush misused the deferral saying 
it only would have applied if the kennebunkport home was to be the 
new principal family residence the irs socked the bushes 144000 
in back taxes and 54000 in interest 
bush paid up but accused the irs of unfairly singling him out 
white house aides are bracing for a new democratic assault on 
the capital gains cut while trying to figure ways to separate the 
two tax cut issues 
it may be a hard job in a congressional election year although 
just last fall the house voted to cut the capital gains tax to 196 
percent from the current maximum of 33 percent and the senate gave 
the plan majority approval however the measure died for the year 
in a procedural vote in the senate 
we think the moynihan proposal will die of its own weight it 
wont have any effect on capital gains bush spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said tuesday 
however other white house aides privately were far less 
optimistic conceding democratic attempts to link the two tax cuts 
likely would make it harder to win a reduction in the capital gains 
tax rate 
as congress reconvened after its twomonth recess senate 
majority leader mitchell spelled out the party line that will spell 
trouble for the capital gains tax cut 
its obviously embarrassing to the white house to be in the 
position of advocating a huge tax cut for the very highest people 
in the income bracket and at the same time opposing any tax cuts 
for middleincome and working people saying in effect let the 
little people pay but lets cut taxes for the wealthy mitchell 
said 
the white house strategy is to sniff at such reasoning and to 
belittle the moynihan proposal which bush himself calls a 
charade that will lead to either higher taxes in other areas or 
reduced benefits 
they point to a measure introduced by sen ernest f hollings 
dsc for a 5 percent national sales tax to help make up revenue 
that would be lost by the social security tax cut 
still analysts suggest the administrations role will be a 
difficult one the moynihan plan has created some chaos out 
there said norman ornstein of the conservative american 
enterprise institute 
and lawrence chimerine senior economic adviser for the wefa 
group a private economic forecasting service based in bala cynwyd 
pa said moynihans proposal will make it more difficult to pass 
the capital gains tax cut how can you come up with that after 
rejecting a tax cut for the average guy

craig washington says he didnt know about a court date he missed 
back in houston an absence that prompted a judge to sentence him 
to 30 days in jail 
washington a houston lawyer was found in contempt of court on 
monday by state district judge jim barr in houston one day before 
he took the oath of office to become a member of the us house 
it was the second time in two weeks a jail sentence has been 
ordered for washington for not heeding notices to appear in court 
on behalf of clients the judge said washington had left clients 
in the lurch 
im going to go about my work in congress washington said 
shortly after being sworn in by house speaker thomas s foley i 
think people in my district understand 
to use an old east texas expression it doesnt touch me top 
side or bottom he said 
washington was elected to fill the seat left by the death of 
rep mickey leland a democrat who chaired the house select 
committee on hunger and who died last year in a plane crash during 
a trip to ethiopia 
i can never replace mickey leland washington said im 
merely his successor 
hearings have been scheduled in houston for washington to show 
cause why he should not be sent to jail 
washington introduced three of his five children to the house 
and received a hug in front of his new colleagues from fellow texas 
democratic rep marvin leath 
asked by reporters about the case that led to the judges order 
on monday washington said i have no idea you know more about 
it than i do 
i was not aware that this mans case was set for trial 
yesterday he said 
but barr said in houston ive done everything i know to get 
in touch with craig and hes done everything he can to avoid me 
he had ample notice to be in the courtroom today 
washington defended his credentials as a lawyer saying he was 
the texas state bars lawyer of the year in 1984 and recounting 
some of the cases he won as a defense attorney 
there are many people who think im the best lawyer in 
texas he said i enjoy an excellent reputation as a lawyer 
i am a good lawyer 
washington said his law firm is going through a transition 
because of his election to congress and that if some clients were 
left temporarily unrepresented it was due to glitches he said 
all will get firstclass representation 
were going to work our way through this he said the day 
will come when all these clients will receive satisfaction with 
respect to representation

apartment owners in the luxury watergate 
complex are suing the district of columbia in an effort to block 
construction of a homeless shelter across the street 
the watergate owners were joined in the lawsuit by other area 
residents who want to bar the shelter which would accommodate 108 
homeless people 
nobodys going to want to live here said ruby barnhard who 
was among residents alleging that the shelter would reduce 
neighborhood property values 
sue marshall the homeless coordinator for the district 
department of human services said the arguments against the 
shelter were reprehensible in the sense that what youre doing is 
comparing a human life to your property value 
units at the watergate which overlooks the potomac river near 
the kennedy center sell for from 179000 to nearly 27 million 
according to real estate listings 
the proposed shelter is part of a city effort to provide 
overnight shelter for every homeless person who wants it district 
voters approved the measure in a 1984 vote 
the district has been under a superior court order to expand its 
shelters since early last year and has been paying daily fines of 
11500 since dec 26 for not providing shelter quickly enough 
a hearing has been set for friday on the lawsuits request for a 
preliminary injunction to suspend work on the shelter 
the watergate complex includes a hotel and offices

a state study of owls diets has 
unsettled some lawmakers who are queasy about spending 180000 to 
learn more about the little hairy balls of indigestible bones 
teeth and hair that owls upchuck 
we cant educate kids in our schools and weve got a person 
studying the diets of an owl said rep ted leverenz who wants 
to cut off funding for the study 
but researchers said the department of conservation study of 
what owls eat during different seasons could help show how changes 
in the environment affect animals 
we owe it to future generations to preserve as many species as 
we can without basic information such as what they eat its 
rather difficult to do that said russell graham an illinois 
state museum geologist and bone expert overseeing the study 
since the threeyear study began in july 1988 researchers have 
collected about 3000 pellets made up of indigestible leftovers of 
what the owls ate 
graham said the owls messy habit of spitting up pellets makes 
them the ideal bird for the study 
with other birds youd have to watch them day and night to 
see what theyre eating or shoot them and dissect their stomachs 
which is not too conservationminded he said 
the pellets have revealed that owls eat rabbits opossums 
ducks pheasants cardinals shrews fish and mice and other 
rodents 
pam fortado gibson field coordinator for the study said the 
information eventually could be used to help farmers reduce their 
dependence on pesticides 
we have no knowledge of our natural pest control she said 
it would help farmers move away from using carcinogenic chemicals 
that pollute our streams 
but leverenz has an alternative explanation for the study 
apparently he said the owl was wiser than we were 
the study also drew fire from wouldbe fiscal watchdogs in state 
government 
ive heard of wastes of money but this one really takes the 
cake said shawn collins a candidate for state comptroller i 
dont doubt the answers would be useful but what are your 
priorities

jesse jackson is neither ruling himself in nor 
ruling himself out of the race for mayor of the nations capital 
following mayor marion barrys arrest on a drug charge 
i have no plans to run for mayor jackson told a meeting of 
community activists tuesday night in his first public appearance 
since barry checked himself in to a florida rehabilitation center 
but moments later jackson said it would be irrational to 
rule out any political option and then said public servants 
with all their options never say never 
the crowd of fewer than 100 people that gathered in a downtown 
church to hear jackson press his campaign for statehood for the 
district of columbia greeted him with a standing ovation but some 
said they were not urging him to jump into the mayors race 
hes doing now what he does best said aurelia corbett king 
hes a national figure we have local people who have worked in 
the trenches but he has a national appeal that people can 
respect 
jackson referred to barry as the hurt player and said 
you take that player off to the sidelines until that person can 
recover but you dont forfeit the game 
asked how he would respond to those who are urging him to run 
for mayor jackson replied in this time of crisis lets not 
make premature and hasty judgments but steady and mature judgments 
the mayor has the time both for recovery and the time to 
make a judgment about his political future that decision will 
be made by the mayor and his cabinet 
when pressed to rule out a run for mayor jackson referred to 
the political leverage he gained by winning millions of votes in 
democratic presidential primaries in 1984 and 1988 and said for 
me at this stage to declare what level we will not use for our 
freedom would be irrational 
ron richardson president of the local chapter of the hotel 
restaurant workers union is leading a move to draft jackson and 
was at the meeting with community activists 
he said further meetings of his group would be held later in the 
week but that were not ready to go to him jackson yet 
i think jackson might get into the race if he felt a 
groundswell of support from the voters said charlene 
drewjarvis a city councilwoman and another declared candidate for 
mayor 
i dont think jackson will do it said david clarke city 
council chairman and the only white candidate for mayor of the 
predominantly black city should barry resign his post clarke 
would become mayor pending a special election 
also formally in the race are councilman john ray and sharon 
pratt dixon a utility company executive and democratic party 
activist 
speaking on condition of anonymity one jackson intimate 
described his wife jacqueline as dead set against him 
entering the race for mayor 
another associate also insisting he not be quoted by name said 
jackson was going over all the options but doesnt want to 
look opportunistic as if he were ready to jump into the race 
within days of barrys arrest 
jackson received 80 percent of the district of columbia vote in 
the 1988 democratic presidential primary and early surveys of 
voter sentiment in the mayors race put him far ahead of all other 
potential candidates including barry 
the mayors office issued an appeal from barry to the news media 
tuesday to stay away from the hanleyhazelden treatment center in 
west palm beach for the sake of my privacy and that of others 
at the facility 
in his statement barry said he and his family were undergoing 
a painful ordeal

only a small portion of federal drug 
enforcement aid goes to the nations cities says the us 
conference of mayors seeking to boost the mayors call for a 
change in the way the government wages its war on drugs 
the study being released today found city governments received 
just 15 percent of the 150 million in federal funds available for 
drug enforcement through the two main grant programs during the 
last fiscal year that amounted to 221 million 
experience to date has shown that only a small percentage of 
federal antidrug funds has actually reached city governments and 
that it has taken a long time for those funds to arrive said j 
thomas cochran executive director of the conference 
the report was prepared for mayors gathering in washington today 
for their threeday annual winter meeting 
president bush will address the bigcity mayors on friday 
marking the first time in a decade a president has appeared before 
the conference of mayors while in office the last was jimmy carter 
in 1980 
the mayors who are overwhelmingly democratic have long 
complained that cities suffered from neglect and cutbacks in 
federal aid under president reagan 
they have complained since enactment of the federal antidrug 
program in 1986 that the governments war on drugs failed to 
provide adequate support directly to cities where most of the drug 
problems are found mayors have urged the federal government to 
make direct grants to cities rather than providing block grants to 
states for distribution 
boston mayor raymond flynn in an interview on the eve of the 
conference said he believed bushs decision to address the mayors 
indicated the administration may be ready to provide more attention 
and money to the cities problems of drugs poverty and 
homelessness 
i sense this time more a sense of urgency by federal officials 
about the condition of the cities more of a concern flynn said 
flynn said urban leaders will be expecting some help as a result 
of the socalled peace dividend the anticipated defense savings 
resulting from the lessening of world tensions 
its not in the best political interest of congressional 
leaders or white house officials to ignore the messages that have 
been coming out of americas cities flynn said 
congressional leaders also will meet with mayors for talks on 
homelessness and drugs one mayor who wont be attending is the 
host washington mayor marion barry who entered a florida 
treatment center monday following his arrest last week on a cocaine 
possession charge 
the conferences study looked at the two grant programs making 
drug enforcement money available to state city and other local 
governments 
under the formula grants program which distributed 1177 
million to the 50 states plus puerto rico and the district of 
columbia in fiscal 1989 28 percent or 336 million went to state 
agencies the conference reported 
another 17 percent 207 million went to antidrug efforts 
that involved more than one government jurisdiction and 16 
percent or 194 million went to counties fifteen percent or 
18 million had not been awarded and only 12 percent or 144 
million went to cities the study said 
the rest about 12 percent was retained by the states for 
administration went to confidential awards or was given to other 
types of agencies the conference said some of the 
multijurisdictional money went to cities but served an area 
beyond the city limits and was not counted in the cities total 
the report said 
the second program awarded 289 million in fiscal 1989 at the 
discretion of the federal bureau of justice assistance according 
to the study 34 percent or 97 million went to nongovernmental 
agencies and 27 percent or 77 million went to cities the 
remainder went to states counties other governments and federal 
agencies

a federally funded program is dropping a rule 
that prevented counties in 10 states from receiving 11 million to 
feed and shelter the homeless 
the rule placed a minimum requirement on the size of counties 
urban labor forces in some situations 
the decision by the federally funded emergency food and shelter 
national board program means that 18 counties that were denied 
direct assistance are being added to the list of 1990 qualifiers 
the counties are in illinois indiana iowa maryland michigan 
mississippi new jersey ohio pennsylvania and washington 
the decision was made at a private meeting friday of the 
programs national board which includes representatives of the 
united way and other charitable groups it was announced this week 
by rep paul kanjorski dpa 
the dark period of uncertainty is over said kanjorski 
whose home county of luzerne benefited from the boards decision 
full funding for our centers provides a ray of sunshine for the 
needy and deserving people who are helped by this program 
the sevenyearold program is charged by congress to 
supplement and extend ongoing efforts to provide shelter food and 
supportive services to the homeless 
the program has recently come under fire from homeless advocates 
for dropping 126 counties that received aid in 1989 to distribute 
food run homeless shelters assist with mortgages or help the poor 
pay energy bills the counties included 20 with doubledigit 
unemployment 
although congress did not cut the program the counties lost out 
because they fell below 1990 eligibility levels for poverty 
unemployment or labor force 
most still will get aid from socalled setaside funds 
although probably not as much as last year those funds 
representing 15 percent of the programs 1249 million budget are 
administered by state boards trying to cushion the blow for 
communities denied direct assistance 
the counties benefiting from the 11 million are lake 
stephenson and tazewell in illinois floyd howard and la porte in 
indiana clinton in iowa washington in maryland jackson and 
midland in michigan lamar in mississippi middlesex in new jersey

a government survey of health experts and 
advocates for the elderly shows nearunanimous agreement that 
physical and emotional abuse is a problem in americas nursing 
homes and widespread concern that mistreatment often goes 
unreported 
for each of seven types of abuse more individuals thought the 
situation was worsening than believed it was improving according 
to two draft government reports obtained tuesday 
while there are no exact statistics on institutional abuse 
any abuse is unacceptable the reports said 
the costs of abuse are measured in the physical and 
psychological damage incurred by the resident as well as by the 
economic costs of treating the abused resident they said 
both reports from the inspector generals office of the 
department of health and human services were based on a survey of 
228 people in 35 states who work in state and federal government 
nursing homes and advocacy groups the reports are in draft form 
and subject to revision 
no statebystate breakdown was available 
the reports conclude abusereporting systems are inadequate 
followup on complaints is ineffective and state and federal 
oversight to prevent abuse needs strengthening 
the reports also recommend the federal government require better 
training for nurses aides about aging suggest ways to cope with 
stressful situations and promote more research and education on how 
to improve staff stability in nursing homes and control abuse 
medical personnel other patients families and visitors all 
contribute to the problem but nursing home aides and orderlies are 
the biggest abusers according to the reports 
the reports said many things contribute to abuse by nursing home 
workers including low staffing levels high stress inadequate 
training high turnover job frustration belligerent patients low 
wages lack of empathy for the elderly and increasing numbers of 
severely ill residents 
faced with heavier levels of care such as residents with more 
debilitating diseases frustrated staff take out their stress on 
the residents said one unidentified official who participated in 
the survey 
the report divides abuse into seven categories physical abuse 
misuse of restraints verbal or emotional abuse physical neglect 
medical neglect verbal or emotional neglect and improper use of a 
residents personal property 
ninetyfive percent of those surveyed said there were problems 
in all seven areas thirty percent said physical neglect was the 
most prevalent problem 16 percent said verbal and emotional abuse 
and 14 percent selected verbal and emotional neglect 
the reports said most research on abuse of the elderly focuses 
on family members and caregivers at home and suggests 1 percent to 
10 percent of the noninstitutionalized elderly may be abused 
although there is less information about abuse in nursing homes 
one 1988 study found 36 percent of surveyed nurses and nurses aides 
had seen at least one incident of physical abuse in the preceding 
year and 10 percent said they themselves had committed one or more 
physically abusive acts 
the hhs survey found nursing home industry officials often view 
the abuse problem as minor but a significant number of state 
oversight agencies and advocates for nursing home residents see the 
problem as serious 
fiftyone percent of those interviewed believed abuse is only 
sometimes or rarely reported by nursing home staff suggesting many 
cases go unreported each year the reports said 
the reports said workers may not report abuse because they fear 
for their jobs are loyal to other staff members fear retaliation 
fines penalties and bad publicity lack sufficient facts and 
dont recognize less blatant forms of abuse 
the survey also found doctors often fail to report abuse with 
66 percent of those interviewed reporting physicians who attend to 
patients at nursing homes rarely or never report it

an agriculture department analyst says it may 
be some time before individual republics or business enterprises in 
the soviet union are able to engage in world trade on their own 
moscows foreign trade organizations or ftos hold centralized 
reins over agricultural trade although economic reforms under 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev are opening other doors such as 
joint ventures and ftos in the republics 
abraham avidor of the departments foreign agricultural service 
said despite the announced reforms the central government 
continues to dominate foreign trade and the pricing procurement 
processing and retailing of food staples 
trade reforms particularly the granting of trade rights to 
republics and qualified enterprises have not yet had a major 
impact he said in many cases republics and enterprises do 
not have enough exportable worldclass products to generate hard 
currency sales 
writing in the current issue of agexporter magazine avidor said 
the republics and enterprises also lack trading experience and are 
subject to export licensing aimed at assuring sufficient domestic 
supplies 
because of the limited impact of trade reforms the central 
government remains the only major purchaser of us agricultural 
commodities he said 
on the other hand us agricultural exporters have few problems 
with soviet tariffs although a tariff schedule is maintained it 
serves mostly as an accounting system to keep track of foreign 
trade 
the largest soviet barrier to greater trade with the west is a 
shortage of hard currency the rubles lack of convertibility and 
government dominance over trade avidor said 
american farmers have benefited from large grain sales to the 
soviet union since the early 1970s particularly since 1976 when 
regular purchases were first specified in a longterm agreement 
between the two countries 
but avidor said the underlying goal of moscow is to reach food 
selfsufficiency and that large imports continue to be viewed as 
temporary necessities 
recent reforms have focused on increasing food supplies 
rather than on controlling consumer demand he said steps 
have been taken to decentralize decisonmaking in agriculture 
allowing more selfmanagement by republics enterprises and 
individuals

snow in the nations breadbasket is raising 
prospects for the 1990 winter wheat crop according to the 
governments joint agricultural weather facility 
the facility is operated by the commerce and agriculture 
departments and reported tuesday on crop and weather conditions for 
the week of jan 1420 
precipitation fell in the great plains from texas to central 
nebraska providing muchneeded snow cover and moisture to the 
winter wheat crop the report said the moderate temperatures 
and moisture were beneficial to livestock producers as they helped 
pastures 
however the report added wheat farmers and fruit growers were 
concerned that the warm weather will start growth too soon 
leaving these crops more vulnerable to a hard freeze later on 
the report said the heavy wet snow in the plains was the first 
moisture of the season for many stressed dryland fields of wheat 
livestock was responding favorably to abovenormal 
temperatures the report said texas ranges and pastures were 
showing some signs of improvement as mild weather and moisture 
returned to most areas 
pastures in oklahoma were greening although heavier 
supplemental feeding of livestock was necessary in areas of the 
central plains because of snow cover 
lambing and calving activity was increasing in michigan and 
idaho the report said florida pastures were mostly 
fairtogood in the panhandle and northern peninsula and fair in 
the southern areas

preliminary estimates by the agriculture 
department show last years crop production was worth about 77 
billion up 10 percent from 1988 
corn output in 1989 topped all crops in value with a total of 
more than 17 billion up from 127 billion in 1988 the 
departments agricultural statistics board said tuesday 
the annual crop values are based on estimated production and 
prices during a crops marketing year the corn marketing year for 
example runs from sept 1 through the following august 
also the preliminary dollar estimates represent the value of a 
crop whether all is sold or partly used by producers the figures 
are used mainly as comparisons from year to year and do not 
represent cash sales by farmers 
other leading crop values for 1989 included 
hay baled 118 billion soybeans 106 billion wheat 77 
billion cotton 4 billion tobacco 24 billion oranges 18

two environmental groups contend a watchdog 
agency created by congress to oversee nuclear weapons plants is 
operating in illegal secrecy 
the chairman of the agency the defense nuclear facilities 
safety board denied the allegation tuesday while a house panel 
chairman said he had urged the board to clarify its rules on public 
participation 
the allegations were leveled by two environmental groups the 
natural resources defense council and the energy research 
foundation which regularly press the energy department to be more 
open about operations of its nuclear arms plants 
the environmental groups announced they will sue the board if it 
does not open its meetings to the public and release records of its 
meetings by feb 14 
the board created by congress in 1988 began operating oct 25 
dan w reicher an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council said the watchdog agency was violating the 1976 sunshine 
act requiring executive branch agencies to hold meetings in public 
and the freedom of information act which requires agencies to 
publish rules on public access to their records 
the board is perpetuating the culture of secrecy it was 
supposed to eradicate at the energy department reicher said 
john conway chairman of the fivemember board said in a 
telephone interview i dont believe weve violated any federal 
laws 
he acknowledged that some of the boards meetings were not open 
to the public adding that we meet every day were a fulltime 
board and we work every day 
it would be impractical conway said to issue advance notice of 
daily meetings and that some discussions would have to be closed to 
the public because they include classified material 
conway said no one had asked to attend the board meetings or to 
review its records 
rep john spratt dsc chairman of a special house panel 
reviewing the nuclear weapons complex said conway assured him 
tuesday that he was committed to running the watchdog board in as 
open and public a way as possible 
spratt said conway had encountered numerous bureaucratic 
obstacles to organizing the boards work in part because of staff 
hiring problems 
in the short term im sympathetic to his plight spratt 
said adding that he urged conway to move quickly to clarify the 
boards rules on open meetings and public access to records 
the board was established by congress in response to growing 
indications that the energy department had hidden or failed to 
uncover many environmental safety and health problems at the arms 
facilities

private energy analysts agree with a new cia 
forecast of a 2fold increase in us dependence on oil imports 
from the persian gulf but they say the increases may be more 
gradual than the spy agency predicts 
william webster director of the central intelligence agency 
told the senate armed services committee on tuesday that us 
reliance on persian gulf oil will more than double in the coming 
few years 
western dependence on persian gulf oil will rise 
dramatically in the next few years webster said adding the gulf 
share of us oil supplies would rise from 10 percent in 1989 to 
roughly 25 percent in a few years he did not mention a precise 
time period and did not elaborate on the import issue 
president bush contends more reliance on the persian gulf will 
undermine us national security because of the risk of a supply 
interruption this argument disputed by many environmentalists and 
members of congress is central to the administrations efforts to 
open more federal lands and waters to oil exploration 
john lichtblau executive director of the petroleum industry 
research foundation in new york said in an interview that 
websters forecast was reasonable if he was projecting to 1995 he 
said its a little bit exaggerated if webster meant the rise to 
25 percent would occur in two or three years 
lichtblau said his organization was projecting persian gulf oil 
will account for between 22 and 23 percent of us supplies by 
1995 he and other analysts tie the increase to growing us oil 
consumption continuing declines in us oil production and 
declining exports by nongulf oil exporters such as britain 
total us oil imports last year rose to 79 million barrels a 
day that was a 10year high and meant 46 percent of us oil 
supplies came from foreign sources according to the american 
petroleum institute an industry trade association 
dillard spriggs president of the consulting firm petroleum 
analysis ltd in new york said in five years time its quite 
likely that the united states will be getting onequarter of its 
oil from the persian gulf but not before then 
thats where its got to come from he said since no major 
new oil fields are scheduled to come into production outside the 
gulf in the next few years 
the energy departments forecasting office does not publish 
projections of us dependence on oil from specific regions of the 
world said w calvin kilgore who directs the office but kilgore 
said he foresees at least a doubling of us reliance on the 
persian gulf over the next five years

a wide range of bills newly introduced in 
congress would cut social security taxes free billions of dollars 
for the nations highways and cash in on the thaw in eastwest 
relations by cutting pentagon programs 
many of the bills introduced as lawmakers returned to work 
tuesday after their winter recess would address the massive federal 
budget deficit and the gimmicks used to disguise the governments 
red ink 
also introduced were bills that would raise the environmental 
protection agency to cabinet status and allow women to serve in 
combat 
the largest political storm has already formed over sen daniel 
patrick moynihans proposal to cut social security taxes moynihan 
was derided by the white house earlier this month when he announced 
the plan which he formally introduced tuesday 
he would roll back social security payroll tax rate from the 
765 percent it reached jan 1 to the previous 751 percent that 
would save workers 7 billion this year and 55 billion in fiscal 
1991 
we must end the shameful practice of using social security 
revenues to finance budget deficits said moynihan dny the 
surplus in social security reserves is counted in the budget 
making the deficit appear smaller than it actually is 
the surpluses are the result of efforts to build up reserves for 
the baby boom generation when it ages and will dwindle after the 
turn of the century 
but the bush administration calls the move part of a democratic 
plot to raise other taxes 
sen ernest f hollings dsc meanwhile rolled various tax 
proposals including his perennial call for a national sales tax 
into a tax reform and competiveness act 
the legislation embraces some of president bushs proposal to 
lower the capital gains tax and includes moynihans social security 
proposal and a plan by sen lloyd bentsen dtexas to restore the 
tax deduction for individual retirement accounts 
this is the fifth straight year hollings has introduced 
legislation for a value added tax as the sales tax is known 
on another budget front sen richard bryan dnev introduced 
legislation he said would release more than 105 billion in 
highway money being held in the federal highway trust fund 
the money represents the accumulated difference between revenues 
larely from the 9centagallon gasoline tax and federal 
highway authorizations critics say the money is deliberately 
underspent to keep the deficit low and provide a cheap source for 
government borrowing 
over the last decade the federal government has used the money 
collected by the federal gas tax as a deficitreduction gimmick 
bryan said 
legislation to elevate the environmental protection agency to 
cabinet level status was introduced in the house and senate with 
supporters saying they hoped a bill could clear congress within 
several months 
sen john glenn dohio chairman of the senate government 
operations committee said the epa needs more clout and higher 
visibility because of the importance of environmental issues in the 
next decade 
sens patrick leahy dvt and alan cranston dcalif moved 
to translate changes in the soviet bloc into less military 
spending introducing legislation to cancel the b1 stealth bomber 
program after the 15 bombers now in production are built 
recent events have made the argument against the b2 even 
stronger said leahy he said taxpayers would save 40 billion as 
a result 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo introduced a bill she has been 
touting since the us invasion of panama last month that would 
remove existing prohibitions on women serving in combat 
cranston under investigation for his role in the scandal over 
the failed lincoln savings and loan introduced legislation that 
would allow the 23000 holders of worthless junk bonds sold through 
lincoln to sue federal regulators for approving the sale 
cranston is one of five senators under an ethics inquiry for 
receiving contributions from lincoln owner charles keating jr and 
intervening with federal regulators on keatings behalf 
a bill introduced by sen christopher dodd dconn would bar 
senators from taking honoraria and limit outside earned income to 
15 percent of salary the measure would bring senate rules in line 
with those approved by the house last year 
sens dennis deconcini dariz and gordon j humphrey rnh 
introduced a proposed constitutional amendment that would limit 
senators and members of the house to 12 years in office humphrey 
said the amendment would go a long way toward restoring a truly 
representative congress 
in other legislation tuesday 
reps silvio conte rmass and joseph brennan dmaine 
introduced separate bills to raise lowincome energy assistance 
subsidies after a cold snap and low inventories sent heating oil 
costs skyrocketing 50 percent last month 
banks and thrifts that launder drug money would lose their 
charters under a bill introduced by rep frank annunzio dill 
chairman of the house banking financial institutions subcommittee 
and rep james trafficant dohio introduced a bill to repeal 
the 1985 grammrudman deficit reduction law calling the law that 
turkey that should be shot down

rapid changes in eastern europe have reduced 
the soviet threat and could lead to the disintegration of the 
military agreement among the warsaw pact nations by the mid1990s 
say bush administration officials 
there can be no doubt that the conventional military 
threat in central europe has declined central intelligence 
agency director william h webster told the senate armed services 
committee tuesday 
the sessions the panels first in a series of hearings on the 
soviet threat to the west will serve as a basis for the 
committees crafting of a defense budget for the fiscal year that 
begins oct 1 
the ties between the eastern bloc nations and moscow have been 
radically altered in the push toward democracy and the kremlin can 
no longer count on those countries to respond automatically to its 
military orders 
in addition the soviet union has been keeping pace with 
president mikhail gorbachevs december 1988 plan to reduce troop 
levels in eastern europe while the soviets economic problems have 
demanded more money normally earmarked for defense 
soviet and warsaw pact strength and capabilities have 
declined webster said the reductions probably lengthen the 
time it would take for the soviets to mobilize for any largescale 
attack in europe 
despite the diminished threat the cia director said the soviet 
union is still modernizing its strategic forces that combined 
with the threats from terrorism illegal drugs uncertainty in 
latin america asia and the middle east and weapons proliferation 
highlights the importance of maintaining a strong us intelligence 
capability 
the comments appeared to be a plea to head off budget cuts for 
the cia and other intelligence agencies whose operations are 
hidden in the defense department budget although the exact figures 
are secret us intelligence reportedly spends 25 billion to 30 
billion a year just less than 10 percent of the defense budget 
the director of the defense intelligence agency told the panel 
he believes the push for freedom in eastern europe will likely 
lead to the phase out of the warsaw pacts collective military 
security role by the middle of the decade 
lt gen harry soyster said a new type of security agreement 
between the eastern bloc nations could emerge 
the rapid turn of events in eastern europe may accelerate the 
removal of soviet forces and may speed the evolution toward such a 
new security order soyster told the committee 
soyster said he believed the soviet union would view a 
largescale offensive against the nato countries with only their 
own forces as highly risky if not impractical 
both webster and soyster expressed concerns over the new and 
more sophisticated threats such as nuclear chemical and 
biological weapons in the hands of nations that support terrorism 
by the year 2000 at least six countries probably will have 
missiles with ranges up to 3000 miles webster said

portauprince haiti ap in a widening crackdown to silence 
political foes haitis military rulers have arrested a leading 
business figure and ordered radio and television stations to 
broadcast only the news they approve 
also tuesday the general heading the interior and defense 
ministries defended the weekend expulsion of four prominent 
politicians as retribution for their insulting the head of 
state lt gen prosper avril 
an information ministry statement told broadcasters that it must 
approve their local news reports and ordered them to refrain 
from relaying or broadcasting any information on haiti from 
stations broadcasting from abroad 
in recent days stations have relayed statements by exiled 
opposition leaders broadcast by radio france internationale and the 
voice of america 
stations also were told not to broadcast anything likely to 
incite agitation 
radio is the main source of information in this impoverished 
caribbean nation which shares the island of hispaniola with the 
dominican republic haiti has two tv stations one governmentowned 
and the other in private hands 
police were reported to have raided three independent radio 
stations on monday with the exception of a 6 am newscast by a 
protestant station none of the dozen independent radio stations in 
portauprince broadcast local news tuesday but official radio 
nationale did 
newspapers were not affected by the ministry directive but few 
haitians read them 
interior and defense minister brig gen fritz romulus said on 
government television tuesday night that the political leaders 
expelled and militants beaten and arrested over the weekend 
maintained a climate of tension and poisoned the atmosphere 
relatives said police on tuesday arrested antoine izmery 45 
one of haitis main importers and a vocal critic of the government 
of president avril telling him he would be forced into exile 
izmery was arrested while driving to work police searched his 
downtown warehouse and went to his home for his passport his wife 
said 
the government declared a 30day state of siege and beat and 
arrested dozens of militants and prominent politicians on saturday 
a day after unidentified assailants killed an army colonel his 
wife and a servant 
most of those arrested are believed to have been released 
critics accused avril of staging the killing of col andre 
neptune and using it as a pretext to clamp down on the opposition 
and renege on his promise to hold free elections in october 
romulus justified the arrests and expulsions of conservative 
leader hubert de ronceray dr louis roy coauthor of the 
constitution communist party deputy leader max bourjolly and 
leftist militant abby brun saying they got into the habit of 
insulting the head of state 
all had denounced what they called human rights abuses by 
avrils government and demanded he resign 
romulus said those exiled could return in time for october 
presidential elections but did not specify a date or say if they 
would be allowed to campaign 
asked by the government tv news director judith brossard to 
comment on the rumor of police brutality romulus said he had 
not seen any but the president had told arresting officers to 
treat everyone correctly 
he said once the police had terrorism under control the 
government would lift the state of siege the united states france 
and canada have condemned the government action 
avril gained power in september 1988 when a soldiers rebellion 
ousted lt gen henri namphy who took over after a popular 
uprising forced dictator jeanclaude duvalier to flee to france in 
february 1986 
the last time haiti attempted free elections in november 1987 
armed thugs in collusion with government troops shot or hacked to 
death at least 34 voters and the balloting was canceled

sen christopher dodd is setting the stage for 
another politically touchy debate over honoraria by proposing 
banning the speaking fees without giving senators a raise to 
compensate for the lost income 
the connecticut democrat introduced the legislation tuesday it 
would apply only to the senate which decided last year to continue 
accepting honoraria in the immediate future 
the house voted to ban the fees next jan 1 in return for a 
large raise dodds bill would ban senate honoraria on the same 
date 
because the senate took a smaller pay raise than the house 
passage of dodds legislation would leave senators earning 
significantly less than members of the house 
lawmakers are not eager to fight another pay or honoraria battle 
in an election year especially since they approved salary 
increases and ethics reforms late last year but dodd unhappy with 
the continuation of senate honoraria said he wont let the matter 
rest 
when the doors closed on the first session of the 101st 
congress the senate found itself in the bizarre position of being 
the only place in the federal government where the receipt of 
honoraria was still legal dodd said in a floor speech 
dodd said he preferred coupling the honoraria ban with a pay 
raise but added absent the political will to vote a pay raise 
the integrity of this institution remains threatened by the 
continued receipt of honoraria 
dodd stopped accepting honoraria in february 1989 
dodd did not include any pay raise in his legislation and the 
senate would be unlikely to attach a pay component to the 
legislation in an election year 
however the senate could pass the honoraria ban now and vote 
itself a postelection raise next year in time to avoid a net loss 
in pay 
congressional watchdog groups such as common cause and public 
citizen have strongly urged a ban on honoraria saying the money 
comes mostly from special interest groups trying to influence 
lawmakers 
public citizen said tuesday that it surveyed senators and found 
43 supporting an honoraria ban 31 undecided and 11 who opposed the 
prohibition fifteen did not respond 
pay for senators is scheduled to increase to 98400 a year next 
month while the house salaries would increase to 96600 at the 
same time 
in 1991 house members will earn nearly 125000 without 
speaking fees senators would earn about 101400 with an 
additional 23568 in honoraria permitted 
in addition to banning honoraria next january the dodd bill 
would limit outside earned income to 15 percent of a senators 
salary the measure would allow senators to make speeches and send 
up to 2000 per speech to a charitable organization

a state task force thats been 
lampooned as an emporium of new age buzzwords completed its 
threeyear mission with a report enshrining selfesteem as a 
social vaccine that empowers us to live responsibly 
much of the rest of the country may be snickering but 42 of 
californias 58 counties including conservative rural ones 
already have formed local selfesteem teams 
in its 144page final report issued tuesday the california task 
force to promote selfesteem and personal and social responsibility 
recommended more parenting courses smaller school classes and 
profamily worksite policies 
when the task force was created with the blessing of republican 
gov george deukmejian it was met with scorn cartoonist garry 
trudeau poked fun in doonesbury having his bubbleheaded 
character boopsie named to the task force which she called the 
first official study of new age thinking 
the 24 task force members have brought the matter of 
selfesteem from a matter of ridicule to a subject of respect 
said assemblyman john vasconcellos the democrat who sponsored the 
bill creating the group 
twentythree of the members signed the report the 24th david 
shannahoffkhalsa called it incredibly superficial and naive 
selfesteem cannot be administered injected nor given to any 
one he said in a telephone interview from his del mar home 
this elusive term is being promoted as a universal remedy for 
a society that is becoming increasingly complex and disfunctional 
the report compared selfesteem to a social vaccine something 
that empowers us to live responsibly and that inoculates us against 
the lures of crime violence substance abuse teen pregnancy 
child abuse chronic welfare dependency and educational failure 
but shannahoffkhalsa a consultant to the national research 
council said the commission did not address the subconscious mind 
adequately 
without probing the depths one will never reach the 
heights he said 
at a march 1988 hearing the first of nine the 750000 task 
force heard san jose high school principal ruben trinidad testify 
i love you i really do 
another principal arvil clark said im not sure i love all 
of you but im sure i could like most of you 
the hearings drew testimony by smallbusiness owners in the 
timberfishing town of eureka near the oregon line aids patients 
in san francisco and masked members of rival street gangs in los 
angeles 
vasconcellos has said he created the task force because as 
chairman of the budgetwriting ways and means committee he saw 
much of the states budget going to repair californians with 
problems such as violence drug and alcohol abuse teenage 
pregnancy child abuse welfare dependence and school failure 
the task forces job was to research whether lack of selfesteem 
contributes to those problems and if so recommend ways society 
can improve individuals selfesteem 
vasconcellos said he plans to send trudeau a copy of the report 
trudeau he said satirizes things that are important and his 
cartoon elevated the task force from an obscure california 
venture to one everyone knew about 
the task force defined selfesteem as appreciating my own 
worth and importance and having the character to be accountable for 
myself and to act responsibly toward others 
it concluded that the family is the incubator of selfesteem 
and that the parents high selfesteem is vital to his or her 
ability to provide a health environment for the child 
vasconcellos said he did not know how much it would cost to put 
the recommendations into practice he acknowledged that some such 
as increased child care would be expensive 
according to the 1986 bill that created the commission the 
states 2 million adult alcoholics and its 3 billion illicit drug 
trade cost the state millions of dollars in medical expenses lost 
productivity law enforcement and corrections

the pentagon says its military officers 
probably shouldnt have made claims during the panama invasion that 
a large cache of cocaine was found in a guest house frequented by 
gen manuel antonio noriega 
you have to do lab tests on things to be 100 percent sure 
said defense department spokesman bob hall 
the spokesman acknowledged tuesday the substance was not cocaine 
and tests on the material were made after the find was touted by 
us military officers gen maxwell thurman the commander of the 
panamabased southern command had pointed to the alleged drug find 
as evidence of noriegas alleged connections to narcotics 
pentagon officials were left trying to explain on tuesday 
exactly what the powdery substance found wrapped in banana leaves 
was 
one report said the substance may have been tamales but the 
military says thats not so 
hall said he could not identify it with any certainty saying 
hed been supplied with less than satisfactory information by 
us military officials in panama 
we said that our soldiers found some white powder wrapped in 
banana leaves in a refrigerator capt art haubold of the 
southern commands public affairs office said in panama the 
substance was taken to a lab and it was determined after that is 
was not cocaine 
the best they could determine was that it was some bonding 
substance used in voodoo rituals thats the way it was described 
to us by army experts at first it could have been mistaken by a 
layman as cocaine 
hall said us officials were trying to get more information on 
the matter the washington post reported tuesday that the find 
amounted to tamales used in voodoo ceremonies 
shortly after the invasion thurman said 50 kilos or more than 
100 pounds of cocaine was found thurman was quoted in a dec 23 
new york times article as saying the cocaine indicated noriega 
condones or uses the stuff himself 
hall said tuesday that clearly the guys who first saw this 
stuff did not know what cocaine was when the experts checked they 
said it wasnt 
hall said he didnt know when it was determined that the cache 
was not cocaine in retrospect probably you shouldnt be 
announcing something you need to be very careful obviously 
he said 
hall said he could not provide any details about any other drugs 
that might have been found during the invasion because of legal 
implications 
the day after the invasion reporters were shown a socalled 
witch house that supposedly had been frequented by noriega 
col mike snell the officer in charge of the area said some 50 
pounds of cocaine and voodoo paraphernalia were found there 
noriega is awaiting trial in miami on federal drugtrafficking 
and racketeering charges 
panamanian tamales are generally wrapped in banana leaves and 
are made cornmeal and chicken meat in the capital and with pork in 
the provinces

lawmakers say they are thinking of how to help 
romania after the disastrous reign of nicolae ceausescu but have 
yet to provide specific ways of improving trade or providing more 
money 
the members of congress spoke in light of complaints by members 
of romanias provisional government that the united states has done 
too little to help the emerging country 
many in bucharest are disappointed by the slow modest and 
cautious reaction to the romanian events silviu brucan a member 
of the provisional government that replaced ceausescu told the new 
york times in bucharest in an interview published tuesday 
ceausescu and his wife elena were executed on christmas day by 
the provisional government 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler on tuesday denied 
the bush administration is dragging its feet on romania instead 
officials are looking for ways to be supportive she said 
im interested in helping romania said senate minority 
leader bob dole rkan who called the country a basketcase 
after the ceausescu regime 
asked in an interview if he would propose additional aid for 
romania dole said it would be difficult to find much money when 
foreign aid resources are stretched thin 
the united states has sent about 750000 in emergency aid to 
romania most of it medical supplies since ceausescu was 
overthrown 
last year romania received virtually no us assistance 
according to john metelsky of the agence for international 
development that compared to the special 400 million that 
congress provided poland and hungary in the waning days of the 1989 
legislative session 
rep frank wolf rva has urged the bush administration to 
move cautiously in providing trade benefits known as most favored 
nation status to romania 
please do not grant mfn until free fair open and verifiable 
elections are held wolf wrote in a letter to president bush 
wolf who has long been interested in romania visited the country 
this month 
ceausescu withdrew his countrys favored trade status two years 
ago in the face of congressional opposition since then trade 
between the two countries has dropped to virtually nothing 
sen christopher dodd dconn who was a leader in the drive to 
revoke romanias favored trade status would like to see its trade 
with the united states improve but he hasnt introduced any 
legislation according to his spokesman jason isaacson 
tutwiler said the department would have to consult with congress 
before any change is made in romanias trading status 
but she said the provisional governments steps towards 
freedom of travel and immigration as well as movement toward a 
pluralistic multiparty democracy will obviously be relevant to 
our conversation of a waiver

angolas leftist president is canceling a 
longplanned private visit to the united states in which he had 
hoped to shift american support away from angolas usbacked 
anticommunist rebel movement 
president eduardo dos santos had been invited by 36 members of 
congress to visit washington early next month and his sudden 
cancellation tuesday touched off conflicting explanations of his 
motives 
the cancellation was disclosed by randall robinson head of a 
private group with close ties to the angola government he said dos 
santos decided not to go ahead with the visit because of bush 
administration pressure 
the state department denied the allegation saying the 
administration has not placed any obstacles in the way of his 
visit 
the administration has accused the angolans of disregarding 
efforts to achieve peace by launching a major offensive a month 
ago robinson blamed the unita rebels for the upsurge in the 
fighting but said the government is now prepared to call off the 
hostilities 
unita vice president jeremias chitunda said in an interview 
tuesday that the fighting has claimed the lives of more than 300 
government soldiers and 62 rebel troops 
word of the cancellation followed a meeting of the top angolan 
leadership which reaffirmed in a communique monday its commitment 
to maintaining a oneparty marxist state the statement contained 
no change in the governments longstanding opposition to direct 
negotiations with the rebels 
the hardline tone of the communique triggered speculation in 
unita circles that dos santos canceled the visit because he did not 
have authorization to make peace concessions 
the united states has no diplomatic relations with angola but 
administration officials were willing to meet with dos santos 
during the february visit if he agreed to certain conditions these 
reportedly included signing a ceasefire with the unita rebels and 
a pledge to enter into direct negotiations with the insurgents 
recently dos santos invited the state departments top african 
affairs diplomat herman cohen to visit the angolan capital of 
luanda cohen was due to arrive there tonight for a 24hour stay 
the invitation sparked speculation that dos santos might be 
prepared to offer a peace proposal possibly including a ceasefire 
angolas principal representative in the united states un 
ambassador manuel p pacavira was in washington on tuesday but was 
unavailable for comment on the cancellation 
but robinson who heads a group called transafrica contended 
the administration opposed the visit because it was fearful of the 
public debate that would be generated about the 50 million in 
military assistance the united states reportedly gives to the unita 
rebels each year 
denying americans an opportunity to hear other side is a very 
bad reflection on this country robinson told the associated 
press 
the angola conflict has raged for years with soviet weapons 
used by the mpla government arrayed against the arms provided to 
the rebels by the united states according to us estimates the 
soviets send more than 10 times as much to the government forces as 
the united states sends to the rebels 
the conflict is one of several examples of superpower 
competition that have survived the winding down of the cold war 
robinson said dos santos had planned to attend a dinner in his 
honor at the home of sen edward m kennedy dmass and to visit 
with the widow of slain civil rights leader martin luther king

after nearly a decade on death row clarence lee 
brandley used his first day of freedom to go to the church where 
his family and friends had held regular vigils for his release 
amid applause and shouts of thank you jesus from 
supporters the softspoken brandley emerged from the creston 
baptist church in northeast houston late tuesday after praying with 
his family and church leaders 
i just recall the words of martin luther king free at last 
free at last thank god almighty free at last said the rev 
ozell brandley who cheered his brothers release along with 
neighbors of the small church 
brandley 38 who once came within five days of execution was 
released on a 75000 bond tuesday a month after the texas court 
of criminal appeals threw out his capital murder conviction for the 
1980 rapeslaying of a 16yearold girl the court issued its final 
mandate monday confirming that brandley did not receive a fair 
trial 
we prayed for him continually said margaret clark 
brandleys sister this is where we prayed for him every sunday 
and wednesday and sometimes tuesdays 
brandley said little except that he was happy to be off death 
row he said he would spend time with his mother and four children 
and move anywhere except montgomery county where he was convicted 
its a great feeling just walking outside the gate knowing 
im standing on some grass not concrete and no nonstop 
handcuffs brandley said as he left the huntsville prison where 
he was incarcerated for more than nine years 
i was doubtful this day would ever come 
at the church brandley bowed his head and exclaimed amen 
as the rev leroy ross thanked god saying you have indeed freed 
an innocent man from execution and after nine and a half years of 
being on death row 
montgomery county district attorney peter speers said he will 
ask the us supreme court to review the case but wouldnt seek 
another trial if the high court refused 
speers said he still believes brandley is guilty of the murder 
of cheryl dee fergeson slain while attending a volleyball 
tournament at the houstonarea high school where brandley worked as 
a janitor 
brandleys first trial ended in a hung jury and an allwhite 
jury convicted him of capital murder in his second trial 
a third trial would be virtually impossible because of the time 
that has elapsed lost evidence and corrupted witnesses speers 
said 
brandleys attorneys have claimed their client was the victim of 
racism brandley is black and miss fergeson was white 
as much as wed like to think this is the 1980s or 1990s and 
racial prejudices are behind us race was a major factor in the 
prosecution and the investigation said defense attorney paul 
nugent 
in 1987 a judge recommended a third trial because the two 
others had been discriminatory on dec 13 the states high court 
agreed saying the investigation lacked the rudiments of 
fairness 
evidence revealed during the 1987 hearing showed contradictory 
testimony from other janitors all of whom were white 
texas attorney general jim mattox said he would not join speers 
in seeking the us supreme court ruling because the original trial 
was racially tainted 
cl buck fergeson the slain girls father said he was 
upset that brandley was free im still convinced hes guilty 
and i hope speers is going to do everything he can to rectify the 
situation 
the janitor who found miss fergesons body henry peace was 
charged with sexually assaulting two girls last year authorities 
said peace who was a coworker of brandleys at conroe high 
school was arrested friday said oj stewart sheriff in nearby 
liberty county 
prosecutors said there is no evidence linking peace to miss 
fergesons slaying 
peace testified in the brandley case but gave conflicting 
testimony during several court hearings

armed troops some with drawn bayonets 
patrolled downtown rangoon today following two days of scattered 
demonstrations in support of detained opposition leader aung san 
suu kyi western diplomats said 
the diplomats in rangoon said several hundred chanting 
protesters gathered near city hall on monday anticipating a final 
ruling on whether ms suu kyi would be allowed to run in may 27 
parliamentary elections 
one diplomat said he had reports of another small demonstration 
in rangoon tuesday evening 
ms suu kyi running for a seat from a rangoon district was 
disqualified by a branch of the military governments election 
commission last week her party has appealed the decision to the 
commissions central body 
ms suu kyi is he general secretary of the largest and most 
popular opposition party the national league for democracy she 
has been under house arrest since july 
the may election is to be burmas first multiparty vote since 
1960 but government critics have expressed doubts about just how 
free it will be 
western governments and japan have condemned recent moves to bar 
opposition figures from the election 
last month the coleader of ms suu kyis party tin oo was 
sentenced to three years in prison on charges of subversion u nu 
the last democratically elected prime minister was put under house 
arrest and barred from the elections diplomats say thousands of 
other dissidents have been detained 
millions of burmese took to the streets in 1988 demanding an end 
to authoritarian rule but the mass protests ended that september 
as the present government seized power its troops killing hundreds 
of people 
the western diplomats in rangoon reached by telephone and 
speaking on condition of anonymity said there were no violent 
incidents in the demonstration near city hall but cited reports 
that at least 20 of the protesters were arrested on tuesday 
the building houses election commission offices 
the mostly student protesters and some buddhist monks chanted 
slogans supporting ms suu kyi and denouncing the promilitary 
national unity party the diplomats said it was an objection 
raised by a candidate of that party that led to the ban on ms suu 
kyi 
the demonstrators who faced armed troops with fixed bayonets 
and riot shields dispersed after dark when it became clear no 
announcement concerning ms suu kyi would be made 
the election commission disqualified ms suu kyi partly on the 
strength of allegations she had links with outlawed student groups 
today troops guarded strategic points and sentries lined 
pedestrian overpasses the diplomats said there seems to be a 
deliberate show of force said one 
the disqualification of ms suu kyis candidacy still has not 
been officially announced 
if it was announced it could generate an explosion of public 
anger and they may be trying to avoid that by keeping things as 
confusing as possible a diplomat said

americans are continuing the trend of drinking 
less alcohol but it still is more widely used than any other drug 
or cigarettes according to a government report 
the 400page seventh special report to the us congress on 
alcohol and health issued by the department of health and human 
services says per capita consumption was 254 gallons of pure 
alcohol in 1987 the lowest level since 1970 
the formula used for the calculation takes into account the 
relative differences in alcohol content of beer wine and spirits 
the report issued every three years has tracked a steady 
decline in alcohol consumption since 1981 
it also cites a us household survey of people over age 12 in 
1988 by the national institute on drug abuse showing that 734 
percent reported drinking alcohol in the past year while 362 
percent reported smoking cigarettes 
the report also found 
about 105 million us adults show signs of alcoholism and 72 
million suffer from alcohol abuse although they do now show signs 
of dependence 
high school seniors showed a decline in alcohol use during the 
1980s but in 1988 one study showed 92 percent had tried alcohol 
nearly twothirds were current drinkers and more than a third were 
occasional heavy drinkers 
nearly half of all motor vehicle accidents are alcoholrelated 
about 25 percent of hospital patients have alcoholrelated 
problems

years of exile in the west

citizenship of his close friend nobel prizewinning novelist

the ground forces commander in the 
us invasion of panama says gen manuel antonio noriega was a 
coward who never did anything worthy of a military man after 
the operation began dec 20 
noriegas main concern was to hide maj gen marc cisneros said 
in an interview tuesday 
noriega took refuge in the vatican embassy on christmas eve 
under pressure from the papal nuncio he surrendered to us forces 
on jan 3 and was flown to miami where he awaits trial on drug 
trafficking charges 
he never fought rallied his forces or did anything worthy of 
a military man cisneros said 
noriegas wife felicidad and three daughters took refuge in 
the cuban embassy and is seeking safe passage to the dominican 
republic but panama has embezzlement charges pending against mrs 
noriega 
noriega has been calling his family at the embassy from the 
united states the cuban ambassador said 
he was interested in finding out about the health of his 
daughters and he didnt say anything about politics ambassador 
lazaro mora said the calls have been brief 
he said noriega had called two or three times since turning 
himself over to us forces 
in the embassy along with felicidad and daughters lorena 
sandra and thais is sandras husband jean rene beauchamps a 
dominican and their son jean manuel the 5monthold boy is 
noriegas only grandchild 
noriegas family is fine they are in good spirits the 
ambassador said 
cisneros is commander of us army south the ground forces of 
the us southern command or us military headquarters for 
central and south america born in brownsville texas he speaks 
spanish and has spent nearly three years in panama 
in the interview he said the invasion was necessary because it 
was evident there was no diplomatic solution and there was a real 
threat to us interests here 
other sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the bush 
administration decided on military action shortly after the oct 3 
failed coup against noriega at least 10 officers involved in the 
uprising were executed some reportedly by an enraged noriega 
after oct 3 we saw a complete degeneration of the panamanian 
defense forces cisneros said indisicipline built up 
there were also the dignity battalions that consisted mostly of 
public employees forced to join but had a hard core of criminals 
recruited by noriega 
the dignity battalions were paramilitary groups trained to act 
as shock troops rumor had it that noriegas reliance on them and 
his arming of them increased as his control diminished over the 
defense forces 
cisneros said that after oct 3 a threat to us interests 
here to our country to our families became very real the 
culminating point came when the us officer was shot and killed 
a us marine lieutenant was killed at a panamanian checkpoint 
on dec 16 washington demanded an explanation and panama accused 
the united states of provocations 
it was clear at that point we had to do something 
cisneros said 
the united states had applied economic and political pressure 
trying to oust noriega since february 1988 when he was indicted on 
federal drug trafficking charges in two florida courts 
noriega denied the charges 
on dec 20 cisneros soldiers normally charged with defending 
the canal rolled out of fort clayton for the invasion in a 
combined operation with paratroopers from the 82nd airborne 
division 
the invasion had been rehearsed us forces in panama had been 
enlarged since may 1989 
cisneros said a noriega bodyguard told the dictator the morning 
of the invasion that he was going out to seek another hiding place 
noriega begged him do not abandon me cisneros said it 
was then the bodyguard decided that it was fruitless to stay with 
noriega a waste of time he did not want more damage for his 
country 
he found a us soldier who spoke no spanish and it took a 
long time for him to come to me to tell me where noriega was 
cisneros said 
by the time us troops arrived noriega was gone

three days ago rodney sumter stood on a subway 
platform waiting for a train with his 3yearold son today he 
stands accused of fatally beating a homeless man who had taunted 
him spit at him and punched him in the face at the station 
friends and family of sumter who was fired last week from a job 
teaching construction skills to homeless men said he acted in 
selfdefense 
he was protecting himself and his son from an unprovoked 
attack that he tried to escape sumters lawyer lewis tyson 
said tuesday as they left the manhattan criminal court building 
but an activist said the death was typical of the 
lifethreatening horrors new york citys homeless face every day 
this has been portrayed to me as new yorkers now have reason 
to be afraid of the homeless i think the homeless have reason to 
be afraid of new yorkers this man is dead said keith summa 
advocacy director of the coalition for the homeless 
sumter pleaded innocent tuesday to firstdegree manslaughter and 
was released without bail 
although there are no statistics on violence involving the 
homeless in the subway system there are more incidents now than 
compared to 10 years ago said transit authority police spokesman 
sgt robert valentino 
two other men were in court tuesday on charges they shoved a 
homeless man to his death beneath a subway train summa recited a 
litany of incidents where homeless victims were beaten battered 
and set aflame 
little is known about the dead man in the sunday night case 
involving sumter 
identified only as john doe he was believed to be in his 60s 
he was a denizen of the midtown manhattan station where he died he 
now seems destined for a potters field burial 
sumter 39 had no criminal record he is married and lives in 
harlem he worked as a plumber at various construction sites since 
coming to new york in 1980 
earlier this month he began work as a 20000ayear 
construction supervisor training homeless men recruited from a city 
shelter the program is operated by the john doe fund an advocacy 
group for the homeless 
he is one of the nicest guys said greg powell a supervisor 
on the project he would try to stop a fight not start one 
george mcdonald the funds executive director said sumter was 
dismissed jan 17 because of personal problems at home he said 
sumter had been distracted and had come to work late 
according to police the confrontation began at 11 pm sunday 
as sumter and his son waited at the 59th street station for a train 
home after seeing the movie back to the future ii 
the homeless man began verbally harassing sumter and at one 
point spit at him said transit police spokesman al oleary sumter 
finally lashed out when the man punched him above the left eye 
oleary said 
the critical piece of information is that after the homeless 
man fell to the platform mr sumter took his head and banged it 
again into the concrete platform oleary said 
sumters wife michelle who picked up their son patah from 
police the night of the killing rejected such talk 
i know he was defending himself and his child she said 
summa whose group handles a variety of problems involving the 
homeless remained skeptical that the case and john does death 
would become anything more than statistics 
what if this was someones grandfather your grandfather 
and he spat at someone in the subway and the person killed him 
how would you react he asked my guess is differently than in 
this incident that tells us something

motorola inc has agreed to pay the federal 
government 750000 to settle claims that it overcharged the air 
force on a contract for a radarjamming device 
we decided to settle it theres nothing other than that 
motorola spokesman lawrence moore said tuesday 
the agreement between illinoisbased motorola and the us 
department of justice follows an investigation of charges that the 
companys government electronics group in suburban scottsdale 
overcharged the air force 325317 in 1983 on a 283 million 
contract 
the two sides agreed that motorola did not disclose cost 
information related to the companys decision to buy rather than 
manufacture some transformer and inductor units used in the 
powersupply system for the devices 
under the federal falseclaims act a company is liable for up 
to three times the amount of an overcharge said michael w 
robinson a justice department spokesman 
robinson said the 750000 settlement was not considered a fine 
moore said it is not unusual for the government and contractor to 
disagree over the appropriateness of certain costs

a government investigator says two national 
hospital chains owe the medicare program 276 million for 
medicares share of excess pension plan assets they took over 
humana corp owes 235 million and hospital corp of america 
owes 41 million said a report by richard kusserow inspector 
general of the department of health and human services 
medicare which paid its pro rata share of the pension 
contributions did not share equitably in the gains that resulted 
from pension plan terminations the inspector general said 
labor unions and their supporters in congress contend the excess 
assets of terminated pension plans should go to the workers on 
whose behalf the plan was operated but legally the money belongs 
to the plan sponsor 
plans may accumulate excess assets for a variety of reasons 
mostly through pessimistic assumptions about the financial 
performance of investments for example a plan may assume its 
assets will earn 6 percent per year but actually earn 8 percent 
when plans terminate they must satisfy existing obligations 
either by establishing new plans paying cash to members or buying 
annuities for members both hospital companies established new 
plans 
the inspector general said 19 other hospital companies 
terminated pension plans before 1983 realizing 37 million in 
excess plan assets those actions were not further reviewed because 
of the small amounts involved 
hca terminated its pension plan dec 30 1982 and humana dec 
31 1980 
the report said the two chains recovered pension fund assets 
totaling 907 million and those assets should have been applied to 
offset hospital costs leaving less for medicare to reimburse 
however hca offset only 202 million against costs and 
humana made no cost offset at all the report said 
for the 705 million not offset against costs by the two 
hospital chains we estimate the medicare program is due 221 
million plus accumulated interest of 55 million the report 
said 
in louisville ky humana spokesman charles teeple said his 
company had not been notified of the hhs report after receiving 
it we will need to study and determine the course we will 
take he said 
in nashville tenn hca spokesman david mcfadden said his 
company had not been notified of irregularities and hcas payments 
contractor blue crossblue shield of tennessee had approved its 
handling of the pension assets we believe that what is occurring 
here is that this is interpretation of rules after the fact he 
said

the state appeals court overturned the 
conviction of an inmate whose weight has dropped by more than a 
third during a 10month hunger strike to protest his life sentence 
on drug charges 
the court ruled tuesday that the evidence used to convict rene 
acuna of cocaine delivery and conspiracy charges was inadequate it 
struck down the conviction and life sentence and declined to order 
a new trial 
acuna who has lived on water and sweet coffee since march 3 
said he would continue the strike until he is freed to return home 
to his companion anna sossa and his two daughters 
i will eat in the table of my house said acuna a cuban 
immigrant and selfemployed handyman whose weight in prison has 
dropped from 180 pounds to 112 pounds 
assistant macomb county prosecutor michael suhy said he will 
seek a review by the state supreme court and oppose acunas release 
in the meantime 
acuna called the ruling a sign of divine power 
i remember in the newspaper people said my hunger strike was 
cheap publicity but that was not my intention it was to show my 
innocence and now my innocence has been shown he said by 
telephone from the state prison near jackson 
acuna contended that undercover agents had lumped him together 
with other hispanics who were arrested during an undercover drug 
buy in a predominantly white neighborhood of warren near detroit 
in august 1988 
prosecutors claimed that acuna was a lookout for the drug 
dealers the other convicted men testified they had never heard of 
acuna 
this has been probably the most gutwrenching case i ever

a woman who admitted killing her baby and 
burying the body in her backyard in 1952 probably will not go to 
prison under a pleabargain a prosecutor says 
marion allen who confessed last year has been confined to 
her own type of prison for the past 37 years rensselaer county 
district attorney james b canfield said 
it would appear her own mental anguish and guilt has exerted a 
more severe penalty than the state ever could he said 
justice is not served by having a 69yearold woman spend the 
remainder of her life in prison 
allen pleaded guilty tuesday to seconddegree manslaughter she 
said she smothered her baby and buried it in the backyard of her 
home 
canfield said he believes judge m andrew dwyer jr would accept 
the agreement under which allen would receive five years 
probation when sentenced march 21 
to the best of our knowledge she hasnt injured anybody 
else canfield said since the death of her child shes led a 
simple life 
allen plagued by guilt went to police in october and confessed 
that she had buried the child in her yard 
she could see the grave site said troy police capt albert 
prezio it was only within a few feet from her window where she 
sat most every day 
authorities unearthed a small strongbox and the remains of the 
baby laboratory tests failed to determine its sex or cause of 
death 
allen spent about three months in a mental hospital following 
her confession she was released a few weeks ago into the custody 
of her husband george 
the woman reportedly told police the baby was conceived from an 
extramarital affair she said she killed the infant without the 
knowledge of her husband who has refused to speak to reporters

a barricade was built around the office of 
the parks commissioner while members of city council demanded his 
resignation over allegations he had ordered pollution dumped in a 
city lake 
i dont think theres any fiction writer who could have 
developed a more inane and criminally evil act said councilman 
james w pitts after robert e delano refused to appear before the 
councils finance committee on tuesday 
common council members said they would subpoena delano to answer 
questions about scandals in his department and would try to cut off 
his paychecks if he didnt comply 
meanwhile a 3foothigh barricade was erected inside the parks 
building tuesday to bar the public from the office suite where 
delano and his top aides work office workers who apparently were 
working at delanos behest denied the barrier was intended to keep 
television cameras out 
they said it was put up because toxic chemicals are stored in 
the building 
controversy has surrounded delano for the past two months since 
the fbi confirmed it was investigating corruption charges against 
him 
the charges include having parks employees do private work on 
city time buying large quantities of supplies for which the city 
had no use and then reselling them to private parties and 
harassment of parks workers city officials and reporters 
last week it was alleged that delano ordered parks workers in 
1987 to pour a saltlike chemical into delaware park lake to keep 
it from freezing after the council took a refreshmentstand 
concession away from some of his close associates 
the chemical did prevent freezing at one end of the lake state 
environment officials are checking the lakes water quality and 
whether environmental laws were violated 
its a horrifying prospect to have your parks commissioner 
polluting a parks lake said eugene fahey council majority 
leader we need to know whether its true 
delaware park is the citys showpiece laid out by frederick law 
olmsted the designer of new york citys central park a big 
celebration was held in 1986 when skating resumed after a 12 
million cleanup of pollution that had kept it from freezing 
thats the jewel of the city of buffalo said councilman 
alfred t coppola whose district includes the park we just 
stocked the lake a couple of years ago and here hes ordering 
it to be polluted 
delano did not return telephone calls seeking comment his only 
public comment on the charges has been the letter in which he 
refused to appear tuesday before the councils finance committee 
unfortunately the news media has made so many false 
accusations and blown this investigation so far from reality that i 
was forced to seek the advice of an attorney the letter said 
he has advised me not to make any statements pertaining to this 
investigation of my department 
mayor james d griffin a longtime friend of delano also did 
not return telephone calls the mayor has refused to answer 
reporters questions about delano but has lavishly praised him in 
speeches and has labeled complaining parks workers stool 
pigeons

the drug rehabilitation center 
treating marion barry stresses physical and spiritual recovery 
through a method largely developed by alcoholics anonymous 
its also a place where tears are inevitable one graduate of 
the program said 
the mayor of washington dc checked into the hanleyhazelden 
center on monday lurma rackley a spokeswoman for the mayor said 
details about his health would be kept private but the most 
serious problem is alcoholism 
the 66bed nonprofit clinic opened in 1986 as a satellite unit 
of the hazelden foundation in center city minn treatment 
generally lasts 28 days and costs about 7500 
the foundation wont reveal the names of current or former 
patients but famous figures who have said they spent time at the 
minnesota clinic include kitty dukakis wife of massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis former washington redskins player dexter manley 
and designer calvin klein 
the weeks after detoxification are difficult but bearable said 
bill hetland a graduate of the minnesota clinic 
youre in such a frame of mind it doesnt take much to get 
the people to cry he said 
the program near minneapolis was founded 40 years ago by a group 
of alcoholics anonymous members and businessmen concerned about 
alcoholism among employees and relatives 
its goal according to a center pamphlet is to help 
chemically dependent people break through denial and to maintain 
ongoing abstinence and recovery upon return to the community 
depending on the severity of the addiction patients spend the 
first day to one week in detoxification in a hospitallike setting 
then the patient is moved to treatment wards where men and 
women are kept separate each ward holds about 20 people 
you can have visitors said brenda lyles a former official 
in the state department of health and rehabilitative services who 
was involved in licensing the west palm beach center you arent 
confined there in the sense that you arent locked down the

inspections before breakfast the rest of the day is spent watching 
films or listening to lectures 
after each session patients return to smaller groups for

president bush calls this city a model 
for driving away gangs and drug houses but anticrime activists 
here say the deadly trade wont go away soon 
bush walked with police and community activists tuesday in a 
neighborhood where dealers peddled crack cocaine under a basketball 
hoop until neighbors took down the basket and chased out much of 
their business 
what bush really did was give us a pep talk and congratulate 
us for what we have done and acknowledge that theres a long way 
to go said p albert williams a member of the ad hoc group 
against crime 
the community organization works with law enforcement 
authorities to close houses used by drug dealers 
the federal government estimates that kansas city ranks sixth in 
the nation in availability of crack ranking 29th in metropolitan 
population the city had the ninthhighest murder rate in the 
country last year according to fbi figures 
to me its a genocide williams said if we keep up the 
drugs were going to kill ourselves 
police maj sylvester winston said 45 percent of the citys 
record 136 homicides last year were drugrelated compared with 
only 10 percent in 1986 
bush spoke to about 1300 metropolitan area law enforcement 
officials in a downtown auditorium saying cooperation between 
police and the community could win major battles against drugs 
people in this town refused to surrender to the drug plague 
you took back whats yours took back your kids took back your 
streets bush said 
but activists and bush himself said the problem had not been 
solved in kansas city the message was that progress was being made 
certainly bushs speech is going to galvanize the crime 
fighters said alvin sykes leader of a group to help crime 
victims its hard to gauge what kind of impact it will have on 
the drug dealers they didnt come down here to hear it 
us attorney general dick thornburgh and federal drug czar 
william bennett joined bush in a meeting with the ad hoc group 
which formed about a dozen years ago to ease tensions between 
blacks and police today the group founded by city human relations 
director alvin brooks marches around suspected drug houses clad in 
blue windbreakers they shout down dealers with bullhorns the 
group set up a hotline for people to report new houses 
our emphasis has been to try to raise the level of awareness 
and consciousness about what drugs and related crimes and violence 
are doing to our community and we attack those crack houses 
brooks told the president 
guided by brooks in an innercity area bush visited a tree with 
a basketball backboard attached to it the hoop has been stripped 
away by neighbors because it attracted drug dealers 
nearby members of black men together an anticrime group 
affliated with ad hoc demonstrated their chant to harass dealers 
change change change you better run dope pusher better run 
at the speech to police bush stumped for a bill in congress to 
reduce constitutional restrictions on the courtroom use of evidence 
seized illegally but in good faith by police 
the concept won praise from terry storey a police officer who 
works with drugraid teams in suburban independence 
its pretty amazing when we lose cases even when its pretty 
obvious that the persons guilty storey said after the 
presidents speech ive lost cases because of technicalities

the potential leak of cia secrets in the trial of 
manuel noriega has led the government to draw up tough security 
guidelines that would force defense attorneys to sign oaths and 
submit their work for review 
in another motion filed in us district court tuesday 
prosecutors asked for more time to go through mounds of documents 
being uncovered since the dec 20 invasion of panama according to 
a published report 
some defense attorneys balked at the proposed regulations which 
must be approved by us district judge william hoeveler 
whos going to decide what is and what isnt classified 
information the government kenneth swartz an assistant 
federal public defender representing noriega codefendant luis del 
cid said tuesday 
but the motion by assistant us attorney michael p sullivan 
insisted the rules are necessary to protect the national security 
of the united states 
the unauthorized disclosure and uncontrolled dissemination of 
such information would cause exceptionally grave damage to the 
national security of the united states it said 
the government requested a hearing on its motion but no date 
has been set 
noriega is scheduled for a bond hearing friday attorneys for 
the ousted panamanian dictator have said they need some documents 
to counter the governments contentions that he should be denied 
bail because he was likely to flee 
the government said the security guidelines were prompted by a 
classified information procedures act notification from michael 
okane attorney for indicted pilot daniel miranda another noriega 
codefendant in the february 1988 drugtrafficking indictment 
okane has been outspoken in calling noriega a tool of the 
united states who acted with cia approval 
the hidden agenda of the government is not to release any of 
this stuff okane said tuesday 
he acknowledged his search for sensitive documents is designed 
to force the governments hand the governments unwillingness to 
release such information could help free his client he said 
defense lawyers also criticized the governments motion for more 
time to produce documents as evidence it is unprepared the new 
york times reported today 
but the prosecution motion said due to the recent events in 
panama evidence is still being gathered and analyzed 
also filed tuesday was a motion for del cid demanding that he be 
released from an 4by8foot punishment cell at the metropolitan 
correctional center southwest of miami defense attorney sam 
burstyn said the confinment is cruel and unusual punishment 
noriega by contrast is being given guest quarters usually 
reserved for the most elite of federal prisoners burstyn wrote 
the facilities that are being occupied by codefendant noriega 
are capable of housing several additional pretrial detainees 
said the motion which asked that del cid be allowed to join his 
former boss at the federal courthouse apartment cell 
noriegas attorneys meanwhile have submitted addresses of two 
homes and three military offices raided by us troops during last 
months invasion of panama and are asking for an inventory of all 
materials taken from them 
on friday us magistrate william turnoff ordered the 
government to preserve all such evidence and submit a list of 
everything taken from the sites 
the defense list included homes in panama city and rio hato 
along with offices at the destroyed panamanian defense force 
headquarters the joint uspanama base at fort amador and the 
departmento nacional de investigaciones 
the pentagon initially claimed it had confiscated large amounts 
of cocaine at one noriega residence but on tuesday acknowledged 
that the wrapped packages were a material possibly bonding glue 
that resembled the powdered drug

contaminated cheese was the sole source of an 
outbreak of salmonella infection that sickened thousands of people 
in three states last summer according to a state health department 
investigation 
the outbreak which officials say may have affected 15000 
residents of minnesota wisconsin and north dakota was traced to 
mozzarella cheese that was contaminated through poor sanitation 
practices at the nowclosed kasson cheese plant in brillion wis 
the tainted cheese was made into shredded cheese products at 
three other wisconsin plants and one in minnesota said state 
epidemiologist michael osterholm 
investigators believe the cheese probably was heated enough at 
the brillion plant to kill any salmonella present during 
processing osterholm said tuesday 
however there was ample opportunity for contamination of 
finished cheeses from employee handling or contaminated work 
surfaces before the cheese was packaged he said 
osterholm said employees also indicated that sanitation 
practices had deteriorated at the plant last spring as it faced 
financial problems the company filed for protection from creditors 
in bankruptcy court in may he said 
telephone calls to the kasson plant went unanswered tuesday 
a wisconsin official said he was not certain the entire 
salmonella outbreak could be traced to the kasson plant 
it might have been other food on salad bars that made people 
ill said bill hanson of the wisconsin department of agriculture 
trade and consumer protections food division 
the three other wisconsin plants implicated by osterholm in the 
outbreak has passed inspections hanson said they were the 
associated milk producers inc plant in portage marathon cheese in 
marathon and schreiber foods in green bay 
bill coleman director of the dairy and livestock division of 
the minnesota department of agriculture said no contamination was 
found at the pueringer distributors plant in rice minn 
low levels of the two strains of salmonella blamed for the 
outbreak were found in two unopened packages of mozzarella produced 
at the brillion plant osterholm said 
the outbreak involved two relatively uncommon forms of 
salmonella salmonella javiana and salmonella oranienburg 
confirmed cases represent only a fraction of cases that 
occurred according to the report symptoms included diarrhea 
cramps fever nausea and vomiting and most of those who became 
ill would not have seen a doctor or undergone testing officials 
said

the videotaped statements of one of the murder 
defendants in the slaying of a black youth by a white gang cannot 
be used in court because he was not advised of his right to remain 
silent a judge ruled

seconddegree murder and other crimes in the aug 23 shooting death 
of 16yearold yusuf hawkins made two statements to police early 
in the morning after the killing later that day he made a 
videotaped statement to a prosecutor 
detective michael bisogna who brought raucci in for 
questioning said tuesday that raucci was not advised of his right 
to remain silent because he was not under arrest and detectives 
considered him a witness not a suspect 
owens replied he could not accept bisognas explanation 
if you believe detective bisogna didnt know then you believe 
in the tooth fairy the judge said 
in a 15minute statement taped the day after the attack and 
played in court monday raucci told prosecutors he had played a 
role in the attack but said he was at the rear of the pack of 
rampaging young men 
prosecutors want the videotape and other police statements of 
the defendants submitted as evidence but defense attorneys contend 
investigators failed to notify the youths they had the right to 
remain silent 
the defendants all white are charged with attacking hawkins 
and three of his companions all black when they went to the 
mostly white bensonhurst section of brooklyn to look at a used car

two disgraced predecessors resigned told fellow party members 
after parliament dissolved that it was their duty to restore the 
peoples confidence in our party 
shortly after the session began speaker of the house hajime 
tamura read an imperial edict written on parchment declaring the 
house dissolved 
the legislators then shouted three resounding banzais 
literally 10000 years a wish for long life and disbanded 
the 10minute session allowed legislators just enough time to 
pass a bill on subsidies for rice growers and to approve plans for 
emperor akihitos younger son prince aya to marry commoner kiko 
kawashima this spring 
the cabinet met later and said it would officially announce on 
feb 3 that the election will be held feb 18 
it was up to the 59yearold kaifu a former education minster 
to decide when to dissolve the lower house he was believed to have 
wanted a later election date so he could make a major policy 
address to parliament but gave in to the wishes of party leaders 
with more clout 
an election must be held by july when the current fouryear 
term of lower house members expires 
pressure for an early election has been building for a year as 
the liberal democrats became mired in scandals and party leaders 
apparently chose midfebruary to get the election out of the way 
before legislators become bogged down with the national budget 
which must be passed by april 1 
at the liberal democrats headquarters today each of the 
partys 270 incumbent candidates received a certificate of 
endorsement a handshake from kaifu and a brown paper bag of cash 
for campaign expenses 
the legislators left laden with bags of new 10000yen 70 
notes legislators who have served in cabinet posts said they 
received about 100000 and those who hadnt got about 170000 
because they need more public exposure 
party officials said about 35000 was a cash gift and the 
remainder was a loan in japan even large transactions are often 
carried out in cash 
the liberal democrats who have governed japan continuously for 
34 years could lose their majority in the lower house and with it 
the right to govern 
in july they lost control of the less powerful upper house as 
voters registered dissatisfaction over bribery and sex scandals and 
an unpopular sales tax taking responsibiilty for the loss prime 
minister sosuke uno then resigned after just two months in office 
and kaifu was the surprise choice for party leader he is widely 
considered an interim leader 
the upper house majority is held by opposition parties led by 
japan socialist party leader takako doi but it is the leader of 
the majority party in the lower house who traditionally becomes 
prime minister 
the liberal democrats face a tough challenge in retaining the 
295seat majority they have held in the 512seat lower house since 
july 1986 although recent public opinion polls have showed support 
for the governing party outweighing support for the opposition 
a poll released tuesday by the national newspaper asahi shimbun 
showed 49 percent of those surveyed supported the liberal democrats 
while 30 percent supported the socialists the asahi did not give a 
margin of error for the survey of 3000 people 
numerically the liberal democrats are almost certain to 
outnumber any other party after the election more than 300 liberal 
democrats are likely to run while the socialists are fielding just 
160 candidates well below the number needed to secure a solid 
majority 
while the opposition has a chance to form a combined majority in 
the lower house analysts say ideological differences make unlikely 
a socialistled coalition with the second and thirdlargest 
groups the centrist komeito clean government party and 
democratic socialist party 
the centrists are more likely to side with the liberal 
democrats the analysts say party sources say the liberal 
democrats have been negotiating behind the scenes to gain komeito 
and democratic socialist support if necessary after the election 
the socialists currently hold 83 lower house seats the komeito 
54 japan communist party 26 and the democratic socialists 25 the 
remaining 29 seats are held by minor parties and independents or 
are vacant 
the socialists and the other major opposition parties met this 
afternoon and declared their determination to end liberal democrat 
rule abolish the sales tax and cooperate ahead of the election 
the liberal democrats have been struggling to restore their 
popularity since many party leaders became entangled in the recruit 
scandal in which over 150 members of the nations elite were 
alleged to have profited from sales of shares supplied by recruit 
co an information services conglomerate 
allegations of influencebuying led to prime minister noboru 
takeshitas resignation and coupled with the unpopular sales tax 
introduced in april contributed to the liberal democratic defeat 
in the upper house 
the february election is widely seen as an opportunity for 
japanese voters to pass judgment on the liberal democrats

hundreds of soviet azerbaijanis gathered 
along the iranian frontier and some started building a new border 
bridge across the araks river irans official news agency said 
today 
the islamic republic news agency said women television 
announcers in the azerbaijani border enclave of nakhichevan wore 
black headscarves tuesday apparently in mourning for victims of 
the baku carnage 
the report came as soviet military authorities banned 
demonstrations and strikes in baku the capital of soviet 
azerbaijan and arrested 43 suspected activists 
soviet troops moved into baku over the weekend to crush a 
nationalist uprising in azerbaijan and end bloody ethnic clashes 
between azerbaijanis and mostly christian armenians 
most azerbaijanis whose historic homeland extends into iran 
are shiite moslems the predominant religion in iran 
thousands of soviet azerbaijanis bound by language culture and 
religion to their iranian kin have crossed the border since the 
violence began 
the iranian news agency monitored in cyprus said about 300 
people gathered tuesday on the soviet side of the border about 12 
miles west of the frontier town of poldasht twentyeight soviet 
armored personnel carriers patrolled a military road that runs 
along the border it said 
about six miles farther west soviet troops stopped azerbaijanis 
from building a bridge across the araks river tuesday the agency 
reported 
but following a gathering by the people and their ultimatum to 
the soviet forces the building work was later resumed and a 
section of bridge foundations was laid it said 
soviet forces continued to observe the operation from a nearby 
village the agency reported 
moscow radio clearly telling the iranians not to interfere in 
azerbaijan declared on tuesday any unconsidered nationalistic 
or religious appeals would be dangerous brutal and illusory 
nationalistic flights of fancy have dragged the people to the brink 
of the precipice 
the soviets fear that iran whose religious leaders see it as 
the champion of the worlds 1 billion moslems is becoming 
increasingly caught up in the crisis in soviet azerbaijan 
in an earlier report tehran radio said 160 of the 270 members 
of irans parliament called on moscow to treat the azerbaijani 
moslems with compassion 
parliament speaker mahdi karrubi a staunch advocate of 
exporting irans revolutionary brand of islam on sunday condemned 
moscow for the crackdown in azerbaijan and warned that soviet 
actions could create more problems for the soviet union 
moscow radio calling for restraint by iran accused karrubi by 
name of political blindness in its persian language newscast

the motive behind a series of 
finalhour confessions by serial killer ted bundy remains a mystery 
today the first anniversary of his death in floridas electric 
chair 
homicide investigators still question whether bundys 
confessions in 23 killings in washington state idaho utah and 
colorado shortly before his execution were merely a desperate 
gamble to prolong his life 
an investigator with the attorney generals office in washington 
said bundy was trying to save his neck by exchanging 
information for time 
he had two things in mind one was to get law enforcement to 
intervene with the governor by saying hed been cooperative and we 
need more time and the other was to play on the sympathies of the 
victims relatives to have them contact the governor and speak on 
his behalf said bob keppel who interviewed bundy in the days 
before the execution 
but dennis couch a utah investigator said by the time he 
talked with bundy 36 hours before the execution the serial killer 
looked like a whipped puppy 
i had the feeling that he knew he was defeated and it was the 
end of the line said couch of salt lake county i felt at the 
time that he was sincere in trying to find the bodies for the 
families 
in the end the confessions won the former lawschool student no 
extra time 
he was strapped into electric chair on jan 24 1989 for the 
1978 kidnaping rape and murder of a 12yearold lake county girl 
her body was found in an abandoned pigsty he also was condemned 
for the slaying of two young women in a sorority in tallahassee 
diana weiner an attorney who arranged the final interviews with 
investigators said the day before his death bundy filed a written 
request for a 30 to 60day extension with the governors office 
he had offered to fully answer questions of investigators and be 
examined by doctors and psychiatrists in hopes they could better 
understand his behavior weiner said 
he wanted to die having left a more full understanding with 
the public of what the underlying factors were in his behavior so 
that we as a society would be able to take steps to prevent the 
kind of behavior he committed she said 
gov bob martinez who signed the death warrant jan 19 did not 
respond to the request 
investigators in idaho washington and utah said the information 
given by bundy in his final days has not led them to any more 
bodies but helped tie bundy to killings and disappearances 
i think he just confirmed what circumstantial evidence we in 
the state of washington assumed all along that he was the killer 
we did not find any remains keppel said 
keppel said bundy admitted to 11 slayings in washington but 
they had only tied him to eight 
bundy also told utah authorities where he left three bodies 
i wish we could have found something some kind of remains of 
some bodies thats the frustrating part about the whole thing i 
had a lot of hope there couch said 
jim whitehead chief of the idaho bureau of investigation said 
bundy confirmed the slaying of a 12yearold pocatello girl who 
authorities had suspected he had killed bundy also told officers 
about the slaying of a hitchhiker near boise no bodies were found 
he also confessed to killings in colorado 
the fbi is working with local law enforcement agencies to try to 
develop a time line by tracking bundys travels using credit card 
receipts arrest records and other documents 
bill hagmaier supervisory agent for the fbis national center 
for the analysis of violent crime in quantico va said the 
profile and time line should be completed in two months 
hagmaier who sat in on all the final law enforcement 
interviews said bundy gave information until minutes before his 
death he confessed to 23 killings and gave information that 
authorities said might link him to other cases 
the bottom line was he said i did it because i enjoyed 
doing it and i wanted to do it hagmaier said of bundys motives 
for the killings 
if there were two things that bundy did in 10 years he spent 
on death row one was try to understand himself and others like 
him and the other was to trying to prolong his life he said 
he was a student of his own behavior

grand jury testimony by a former model who 
helped the fbi arrest mayor marion barry in a cocaine sting is part 
of an investigation of possible perjury by the mayor law 
enforcement sources say 
rasheeda moore 38 testified for 2 hours on tuesday in the 
investigation of whether barry lied under oath by denying he used 
drugs the sources say 
ms moore identified by law enforcement sources as the woman 
who cooperated with the fbi in last weeks arrest of barry on a 
cocaine possession charge testified in secret 
she has recently told investigators about using crack cocaine 
with barry on numerous occasions during a lengthy romantic 
relationship said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
ms moores accounts of drug use with barry during a weekend 
trip to the virgin islands in 1988 back up testimony by convicted 
drug dealer charles lewis who also is cooperating with the 
investigation according to the sources 
lewis who friday received a 15month prison term for cocaine 
conspiracy has testified he bought drugs for barry and smoked 
crack cocaine with him in a downtown hotel in washington and during 
the march 1988 weekend in the virgin islands 
the yearlong investigation of barry was touched off by reports 
that the mayor was in lewiss room at the downtown ramada inn on 
dec 22 1988 when city police went to investigate reports lewis 
was selling drugs 
the officers abruptly and inexplicably left the hotel after 
learning the mayor was in lewis room 
last thursday the mayor was videotaped by fbi agents smoking a 
small amount of crack cocaine after purchasing the drug during a 
visit to ms moores room at the vista international hotel 
according to sources 
the mayor was arrested and later charged with misdemeanor 
possession of cocaine by fbi agents who monitored the episode on a 
surveillance camera in an adjacent room 
ms moore began cooperating with the investigation several weeks 
ago following her arrest in the los angeles area on a charge of 
driving while intoxicated according to one source 
the sting operation was approved at the highest levels of the 
fbi and was carefully planned to avoid any defense claims the mayor 
was entrapped according to sources 
the mayor in sworn grand jury testimony last year denied 
allegations of drug use said the sources who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
an undercover operation to catch the mayor on a misdemeanor drug 
charge would not have been approved if there had not been 
suspicions that barry lied to the grand jury when questioned about 
drug use the sources said 
one source said an indictment from the grand jury was not 
expected soon adding that the panel had to consider a complicated 
set of evidence 
fbi agents instructed ms moore not to suggest drug use and she 
was told not to use crack cocaine herself sources said barry 
inquired about getting some drugs shortly after he entered the 
room according to court papers 
us attorney jay b stephens indicated last friday that more 
charges were likely to be brought in an ongoing investigation of 
a broader range of allegations our office has been pursuing since 
last january following the ramada inn incident 
the prosecutor said he viewed barrys arrest not as the end of 
an event but as part of an ongoing investigation 
the probe sources say also is focusing on allegations of 
contract fraud in the district of columbia government where 
several of the mayors top associates have been convicted of 
federal corruption charges in the last five years sources say 
prosecutors meanwhile opposed a request by barrys lawyers to 
suspend weekly drug testing of the mayor who checked into a west 
palm beach fla drug rehabilitation center on monday 
the prosecution team filed court papers suggesting the mayor 
undergo tests at a federal pretrial services office near the drug 
clinic where he is staying

the defense minister abruptly 
resigned today in a disgreement with the army chief of staff 
the minister italo luder quit after telling a radio station he 
had ordered the chief of staff gen isidro caceres to be 
disciplined for arranging a meeting last week with the president 
that exluded luder 
caceres discussed military problems including internal 
security at the dinner meeting with president carlos menem and 
other top aides luder told radio mitre i was in the city 
and did not know of the meal he said 
for that caceres merits a sanction luder said 
there was no immediate response from caceres who helped the 
government of former president raul alfonsin put down the villa 
martelli army insurrection led by thencol mohamed seineldin in 
december 1988 
luder met with menem this morning afterward he told reporters 
he handed the president his undeclinable resignation 
there was no immediate comment from menem 
the dispute comes at a time when the government has failed to 
solve several problems in the military including low pay for 
soldiers poor equipment and a budget so small that the number of 
conscripts this year was reduced 
also the army remains divided between a nationalist sector that 
staged three insurrections against alfonsin between april 1987 and 
december 1988 and a sector led by caceres that is loyal to the 
government 
in october menem tried to resolve the thorny problem of 
officers accused of kidnapping torture and murder during the 
197683 dictatorship by pardoning several hundred along with 
several dozen alleged leftwing subversives 
menem who took office in july said the pardon was necessary to 
achieve national conciliation but he did not extend it to the 
former commanders of the juntas during the last dictatorship who 
not only were accused but prosecuted convicted and sentenced 
caceres and other army leaders have publicly stated in recent 
weeks that the commanders should be freed from prison

the largest dissident alliance today 
pledged a nationwide drive to stop president roh taewoos 
governing party and two opposition parties from joining forces to 
create a single conservative party 
differences were reported today as talks began on how to 
complete the merger officials involved in the negotiations said 
there was disagreement over who should lead the new party which is 
to be inaugurated in may 
the move announced after talks monday between roh and 
opposition leaders kim youngsam and kim jongpil will join the 
governing democratic justice party with the nations no 2 and 3 
opposition groups led by the two kims 
the new party tentatively called the democratic liberal party 
would be the first in koreas modern history formed by ruling and 
opposition parties 
police today said hundreds of officers were mobilized to protect 
the two kims whose homes and offices have been flooded with 
threatening telephone calls since the announcement 
roh says a new broadbased governing party will give the country 
the political stability it has never had but some fear it will 
radicalize the opposition and cause antigovernment violence 
the united national democratic movement the nations umbrella 
dissident organization involving about 200 groups agreed to launch 
a nationwide movement with all democratic forces opposing the 
new party a spokesman said 
the alliance played a key role in months of street protests that 
forced the government to carry out broad reforms in 1987 
the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
alliance was ready to work with radical students workers and kim 
daejung whose opposition party for peace and democracy will be 
hurt by the merger it called for immediate elections to form a new 
national assembly 
kim daejung has pledged to collect 10 million signatures on 
petitions calling for new elections to block creation of the new 
party 
a 15member working committee was formed today to discuss 
procedures on the merger of rohs party with kim youngsams 
reunification democratic party and kim jongpils new democratic 
republican party 
officials involved said there were differences over how to 
compose the new partys leadership and hierachy 
members of kim youngsams party want their leader to head the 
new party and supervise its affairs while governing party 
officials support a collective leadership controlled by roh the 
officials said 
roh defeated kim youngsam in the 1987 presidential election by 
a narrow margin 
the merger could be a major victory for roh who will be assured 
of a twothirds majority in the oppositioncontrolled national 
assembly but it could cause serious repercussions by isolating the 
party for peace and democracy the nations most radical and 
largest opposition group 
the party controls the underprivileged cholla provinces where 
onefifth of the nations 42 million people live kwangju the 
scene of a civil uprising in 1980 that left 200 people dead by 
official count is the capital of south cholla province 
the merger also could enliven dissident movements and touch off 
a new wave of violent antigovernment demonstrations 
kim daejung has declared a virtual political war against the 
roh government announcing that our party is prepared to make any 
sacrifice to block the oneparty dictatorship 
dissidents and radical students denouncing the new party as an 
attempt by a prous military dictatorship to prolong its power 
also promised to fight 
the planned merger came as a surpise the two centrist 
opposition parties had been discussing a possible merger but few 
expected rohs governing group to join them 
the merger generally is viewed as a result of rohs desire for 
political stability by obtaining a parliamentary majority coupled 
with the two kims ambitions for postroh leadership 
roh steps down in early 1993 at the end of a single fiveyear 
term 
his party has been in an uncomfortable situation since losing 
its parliamentary majority in the 1988 elections for the first time 
in south koreas 40year constitutional history 
observers think rohs dislike of kim daejung swayed him to 
choose the other two kims as his merger partners 
roh as an army general helped former president chun doohwan 
seize power with military backing in an internal coup in 1980 
under the martial law government controlled by roh and chun 
kim daejung was given the death penalty on what he called 
trumpedup sedition charges in 1980 the sentence was later 
commuted to life in prison and the opposition leader was freed a 
few years later under us pressure

a retired grocery clerk charged with nazi war 
crimes was ordered extradited to west germany after waiving his 
right to a hearing 
he just wants to get it over with attorney ronald g parker 
said of bruno karl blachs decision 
the 70yearold blach imprisoned since october has been 
accused by west german authorities of murdering three concentration 
camp inmates during a forced march between nazi camps in 1945 
blach maintains his innocence 
he was to be flown immediately to west germany for trial 
authorities said 
blach becomes only the fourth alleged nazi war criminal to be 
extradited from the united states since 1973 when the us 
government began searching out such people said murray stein 
senior counsel with the us department of justice 
parker said he believed blach could have fought extradition on 
technical grounds and won but he said blach knew other legal 
efforts would follow 
blach a native of czechoslovakia and a permanent resident of 
the united states with a west german passport lived suburban la 
habra until his arrest in october 
blach who entered the united states in 1956 was ordered 
deported in 1987 but an appeal is still pending 
during an emotional deportation hearing a concentration camp 
survivor identified blach as the nazi guard who used a machine gun 
to kill an elderly polish jew who faltered during the forced march 
between the wiender neudorf concentration camp in germany to the 
mauthausen camp in austria 
parker said that unlike three war criminals who were extradited 
and convicted blach was not in a position of power during the war 
he was at most a private firstclass he said 
the others extradited were hermine braunsteiner ryan a former 
concentration camp guard who became a homemaker on long island 
ny andrija artukovic a los angeles man convicted of ordering 
the deaths of several hundred people while serving as a cabinet 
minister in the nazi puppet state of croatia and john demjanjuk of 
cleveland who was extradited to israel and convicted of mass 
murders at the treblinka death camp in poland

opposition forces have postponed talks with 
premier hans modrow on entering his caretaker government 
indicating their reluctance to be associated with the 
stilldominant but increasingly unpopular communists 
in the latest demonstration of east germans growing impatience 
with the authorities more than 10000 skilled workers rallied in 
east berlin on tuesday to denounce communism for squelching 
craftsmanship 
they demanded freemarket reforms to revive artisanship and 
many echoed increasing calls for reunification with prosperous west 
germany 
a new round of warning strikes bleak new economic data and the 
announcement of price increases for farm products have added to the 
sense of crisis 
the official news agency adn said tuesday that the east german 
economy posted its lowest growth of the decade last year expanding 
by 2 percent instead of the 4 percent called for by central 
planners 
the continuing exodus of workers to west germany more than 
340000 left last year and they are fleeing at the rate of nearly 
2000 per day was a major factor in the slowdown in growth adn 
said 
the agency also reported that a new round of price increases 
will make some farm products substantially more expensive starting 
feb 1 
west german economics minister helmut haussmann visiting east 
berlin said east germany would move quickly toward freemarket 
reforms to spur its sagging centrally planned economy and make it 
appealing to west german businesses 
haussmann attending the first meeting of an intergerman 
commission on economic cooperation said modrow had accepted an 
offer of 35 billion in west german aid for east german small and 
mediumsized businesses 
modrow a communist has sought to draw the inexperienced 
popular opposition into accepting direct participation in his 
coalition government by offering the reform forces ministerial 
posts 
he had called for talks to begin today but on tuesday leaders 
of the splintered prodemocracy forces said they had postponed 
negotiations at least until early next week to coordinate their 
position 
the delay showed how hesitant the opposition is to prop up the 
government before the countrys first free elections may 6 when 
the communists are expected to be voted out 
british foreign minister douglas hurd completed a threeday 
visit to east germany today and said britain will look for ways to 
give economic aid to east germany including joint business 
projects and training for managers 
he suggested there are few alternatives to modrows interim 
government and said further instability could hurt that nations 
move toward democracy 
it is very important that what the prime minister is trying to 
do will succeed and that he will have the support to carry this 
government through to may 6 hurt said 
the communist party has suffered mass defections since the 
peaceful october revolution that brought down its old hardline 
leadership 
lothar de maiziere chairman of the christian democrats a party 
in modrows coalition that once was aligned with the communists 
said he expected the communists to gain at best 10 percent in the 
balloting 
de maiziere told west germanys bild newspaper he expects about 
30 percent of the vote for his party and other newlyfounded groups 
with a christian orientation 
the increasingly influential social democratic party will also 
get about 30 percent de maiziere predicted in the interview 
currently however the opposition has difficulty projecting the 
impression it could actually run the country east germans are 
increasingly looking to unification with prosperous west germany in 
hopes for a brighter future 
bild on tuesday quoted an adviser to soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev as saying the soviets would not block german 
reunification if the east germans want it but nikolai portugalov 
gorbachevs adviser on german affairs was also quoted as 
cautioning against the forced acceleration of unification because 
it could undermine europe 
unrest in the labor force intensified tuesday with workers in 
six cities staging brief warning strikes to press for higher pay 
and better working conditions adn said 
participating in the stoppages were employees in a psychiatric 
hospital in ueckermuende some 500 health workers in suhl taxi 
drivers in leipzig and bank employees in quedlinburg district the 
agency said 
tuesdays rally of artisans in east berlin was called on short 
notice and against the wishes of top union leaders still loyal to 
the comunist system that rewarded them with comfortable 
bureaucratic positions 
we absolutely and unconditionally need conversion to a full 
market economy burkhard schmidt spokesman for the craftmens 
union said before the rally

the cabinet met today for the 
first time this year with an agenda that included the release of 
jailed black leader nelson mandela and the possible unbanning of 
the african national congress 
decisions reached at the meeting will change the face of south 
africa permanently said the sowetan the countrys largest 
blackoriented daily newspaper 
the cabinet traditionally does not announce its decisions 
immediately after its meetings and the outcome of todays session 
might not be known until president fw de klerk gives a speech 
feb 2 at the opening of parliament 
mandela the countrys most popular black leader has been 
jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for helping plan 
the start of the ancs antigovernment sabotage campaign the 
government has confirmed that he will be freed and there is strong 
speculation the release could occur by midfebruary 
his release is one of several conditions which the anc says must 
be met before it enters negotiations on a new political system that 
would extend voting rights to blacks the outlawed movement also 
demands that it be legalized that the state of emergency imposed 
in 1986 be lifted and that the government halt trials and 
executions of political opponents 
government officials have indicated that these conditions could 
be met at least to a large extent leaving the anc with a decision 
as to whether it should join negotiations 
the staterun south african broadcasting corp in a commentary 
today said the anc is being forced to move away from a strategy 
of violence and towards an acceptance of peaceful negotiation 
mandela who has been meeting regularly with government and 
opposition leaders last week submitted the outlines of a peace 
plan to the ancs exiled leadership in lusaka zambia 
details of the plan have not been disclosed the star of 
johannesburg south africas largest daily said today the reason 
for the secrecy was that the plan contains proposals which are 
either extremely sensitive or embarrassing to the anc 
justice minister kobie coetsee one of the cabinet members who 
has met frequently with mandela said tuesday that the 71yearold 
prisoner might be asked at serve as a mediator between the 
government and the anc 
the anc advocates a oneperson onevote system in which the 28 
million blacks would be able to control the government 
de klerk envisions some sort of system in which the 5 million 
whites would retain a veto over major policy decisions

israeli soldiers exchanged gunshots across the 
jordanian border near an area where jordanian troops were 
patrolling but no injuries were reported and no inflitrations 
occurred the army said today 
it was not clear who fired the opening round from the jordanian 
side in tuesdays exchange said an army official who demanded 
anonymity 
the incident occurred near moshav hatzeva a communal 
agricultural settlement about 70 miles southeast of jerusalem 
jordans policy in the past has been to keep the border with 
israel quiet and to prevent attempts by palestinian guerrillas to 
infiltrate israel 
tuesdays exchange of gunfire was the sixth shooting incident 
this year along the jordan border the army said 
on jan 7 israeli troops killed an infiltrator dressed in a 
jordanian army uniform near the northern israeli resort town of 
tiberias 
that incident prompted israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin to 
issue a tough warning holding jordan responsible for any border 
infiltrations 
last year there were seven incidents along the jordanian border 
including six infiltrations according to the army 
three israeli soldiers were killed and at least seven soldiers 
and civilians were wounded in the 1989 incidents the army said

i hope that he not only survives but stays strong because i 
think it is in our interest that perestroika succeeds bush said 
bush was questioned closely about the veto confrontation with 
congress over the chinese student legislation and he bristled at 
the idea that he was not concerned about human rights 
that is absolutely ridiculous said bush whose china policy 
has been widely criticized in the months since the prodemocracy 
movement in beijing was crushed by military forces 
as for the students bush said not one was sent back they 
were safe then and they are safe now and they will be safe in the 
future a questioner asked whether the issue with congress was 
one of trust many members of congress were angry or concerned 
after learning that bush had dispatched top administration figures 
on a secret trip to china after saying publicly that high level 
exchanges were being curtailed due to the june crackdown 
he said china faced with the pending legislation might well 
retaliate by cutting off other sorts of academic contacts with the 
united states the price of the legislation is lost opportunity 
for the scholars of tomorrow congress in my view will have only 
itself to blame

four of the nations biggest defense 
contractors have asked the government to approve a team effort to 
develop the national aerospace plane a futuristic aircraft that 
could go from runway into orbit 
the move would allow the contractors who had been working 
independently on the project since 1985 to get more for our 
money jim schlueter a spokesman for st louisbased mcdonnell 
douglas corp said tuesday 
the other contractors are general dynamics corp the north 
american aircraft and rocketdyne divisions of rockwell 
international corp and the pratt amp whitney division of united 
technologies corp 
theoretically the experimental nasp x30 aerospace plane would 
be capable of flying 25 times the speed of sound and 10 times 
faster and three times higher than existing commercial aircraft 
the companies have created their own designs but have shared 
some research mainly on construction materials a prototype is 
scheduled to be flown in the late 1990s 
the team agreement is subject to approval by the air force nasa 
and the navy 
we dont anticipate any problems because this is consistent 
with the goal of the program said jw stout a spokesman for 
st louisbased general dynamics 
stout said the companies have worked together on researching and 
testing materials for use in the plane finding a material that is 
lightweight and can withstand intense heat is one of the linchpins 
of the planes development 
the team selected barry waldman a veteran of 26 years of 
technical and management experience with rockwell as program 
director 
the announcement ends a heated battle between rocketdyne and 
pratt amp whitney for the contracts to build engines for the plane

a suburban high schools program of random drug 
tests on athletes began without protests but with some raising the 
issue of privacy 
it wasnt that bad said megan mulcahey a member of the 
girls basketball team and one of the first group of 14 students 
who willingly underwent urine tests tuesday at homewoodflossmoor 
high school they treated you nice and everything 
amanda levenberg student government president predicts 
opposition will grow as more students are called upon to undergo 
the procedure 
though not a first nationally the program has gotten attention 
because of its scope the school plans eventually to test all 1200 
sports participants among its 2000member student body 
i was expecting a lot more friction from the student body 
people are complying and theyre not complaining said miss 
levenberg 17 i think it wont hit kids until they have to go 
pee in a cup for someone to test them 
miss mulcahey said she considers the tests a violation of 
privacy that unfairly singles out student athletes 
i dont think its fair that just us are being tested she 
said in a telephone interview if theyre going to go ahead and 
have that it should be everyone 
the school board approved the program in september at the 
suggestion of the football coach who suspected drug use by a 
couple of students athletic director ken schultz said 
schultz picked the first students to be tested from those 
involved in such winter sports as swimming basketball wrestling 
and gymnastics and their parents signed consent forms 
the tests detect use of alcohol steroids and several other 
drugs including marijuana and cocaine students wont know when 
they will be tested until their day comes 
students and their parents will be notified of results within 48 
hours said principal charles smith those who test positive must 
see a drug counselor within 48 hours 
students determined by the counselor to be abusers will be 
suspended from sports and required to undergo treatment they will 
be tested again after 30 days and may return to athletics if they 
pass smith said more treatment is ordered for those who dont 
pass 
schultz said the program probably will be expanded to include 
students involved in other extracurricular activities at the 
school whose students come from several upper middleclass 
largely white southwestern suburbs 
school officials say the tests will give kids an incentive to 
reject drugs 
on weekends when they go to the parties and alcohol is 
served these kids can say no because i might be tested next 
week said smith

coaches applauded the city school boards 
dropping of a policy that barred students who get an f from 
taking part in sports 
board members supporting the reversal said they thought the 
nopass noplay rule adopted seven years ago in the nations 
secondlargest school system had discouraged students from taking 
challenging courses for fear of failure 
the reality is we have students in unfortunately large 
numbers who are simply not taking academically challenging 
classes said board member jackie goldberg 
the boards 52 vote monday put the los angeles district in line 
with a 1987 state law requiring students in grades 4 through 12 to 
have at least a c average to participate in sports music 
drama and other extracurricular activities 
los angeles which ranks in size behind new york city with 
594000 students in 1982 became the nations first major school 
district to approve a nopass noplay policy in 1984 texas 
adopted such a law statewide 
a los angeles district study last year found most students 
teachers and counselors supported the rule most principals along 
with coaches and others who ran afterschool programs opposed it 
ive always been against the nofail rule and not because im 
antiacademic said darryl stroh football and baseball coach at 
granada hills high school the c average is a good enough rule 
if a kid takes a fail and the rest of his grades are good 
enough to absorb it then theres no justification for denying him 
eligibility 
dissenting were board members leticia quezada and rita walters 
who introduced the rule ms quezada characterized the reversal as 
a step backward and said it was exactly the kind of message 
we dont need 
the message should be if you fail in a subject you must 
leave everything behind and focus on your school work she said 
the board also heard from parents and students many of whom 
opposed dropping the rule 
by repealing the nofail rule we are compromising academic 
excellence said kerry lotts a north hollywood high school 
junior 
if a student fails only one class how will he be able to 
have time for these activities ms lotts asked we need to 
support a badly eroding system

president bush lobbying to sustain his veto 
of legislation to protect chinese students from deportation said 
today congress will have only itself to blame if it overrides 
his veto and authorities in beijing retaliate 
in a wideranging morning news conference bush also sidestepped 
a question on the use of force by soviet authorities attempting to 
put down civil disorder in the distant region of azerbaijan but 
indicated his trust in soviet leader mikhail gorbachev anytime 
you have a use of force and a loss of life we have concern but i 
dont believe i can judge that right now he said 
of gorbachevs future he added i hope that he not only 
survives but stays strong 
the key event today for bush was congressional consideration of 
his veto of the chinese student legislation the house was expected 
to vote to override the veto later in the day and bush met before 
his news conference with republicans in the senate in hopes of 
sustaining his veto there 
congress has upheld each of bushs previous ten vetoes bush 
said he had taken steps to provide protection to chinese students 
studying here at the time of the crackdown in tiananmen square last 
june not one was sent back bush said of the students they 
were safe then and they are safe now and they will be safe in the 
future 
he said the legislation was unnecessary and suggested it invited 
retaliation against american scholars in china 
but many lawmakers upset with bushs diplomatic overtures to 
beijing favor legislation anyway to give automatic visa protection 
to the estimated 32000 chinese students in the united states 
meeting with reporters four days past his first anniversary in 
office bush also 
lambasted a plan by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny to 
reduce social security taxes as a sleight of hand that could 
lead to increases in other taxes or to reductions in social 
security benefits

here is the text of president bushs comments 
wednesday at a news conference 
good morning good morning well as you know ill soon present 
my budget to the congress and as i prepare to do so it strikes me 
that our nation faces challenges on many fronts so lets give each 
the attention it deserves tomorrow 
im going to announce the second phase of our strategy to fight 
drugs in the schools and the streets of america the future of this 
country depends on whether we can give our children a chance to 
grow up drugfree 
and secondly i will soon present our plan to restructure 
americas defenses in the wake of the dramatic changes that are 
taking place abroad and im proposing a defense budget that begins 
the transition to a restructured military a new strategy that is 
more flexible more geared to contingencies outside of europe while 
continuing to meet our inescapable responsibility to nato and to 
maintaining the global balance 
and finally secretary brady and director darman and chairman 
boskin will put the details of our budget before the american 
people 
and as that occurs other members of the administration the 
cabinet key agencies will provide an indepth outline of their 
efforts to address the many challenges of caring for the afflicted 
and uplifting the poor cleaning the environment educating our 
kids as well as other important issues 
all of this is preparatory to the state of the union one week 
from today in which i will speak to the broader issues that we 
face as a nation 
there are two items that i want to mention here today and then 
take some questions first ive decided that the environmental 
challenges that face america and the world are so important that 
they must be addressed from the highest level of our government 
and at the beginning of this century president roosevelt 
theodore roosevelt helped pave the way for the establishment of 
the national park system twenty years ago president nixon 
established the epa environmental protection agency by executive 
order that is now one of the largest and most important regulatory 
agencies in the government 
and today id like to announce another step forward in this 
important tradition of support for conservation and environmental 
protection 
many countries have environmental ministers and now and with 
cabinet status and i am convinced that that cabinet status will 
help influence the worlds environmental policy so with so many 
difficult decisions ahead ill need bill reillys counsel ill 
need him sitting at my side in the cabinet and im pleased to 
endorse the elevation of the epa to cabinet status by creating a 
department of the environment 
senators glenn and bill roth chairman and ranking members of 
the government senate government affairs committee have 
introduced legislation that would create this department 
congressman conyers and horton are working on similar legislation 
and i look forward to working with them and other interested 
members of the house and senate to enact legislation that would 
bring epa to the cabinet table where it now belongs 
and now id like to address one other issue that i know is 
foremost on your minds every american should know i want to take 
this opportunity to state this as strongly as i can that i will 
not break faith with the chinese students here i have made that 
very clear from the very beginning 
and right after tiananmen i moved to protect the chinese 
students in this country not one was sent back they were safe 
then and they are safe now and they will be safe in the future 
and when congress passed the pelosi bill last fall i was faced 
with a choice if i signed the bill the students would still be 
safe but china would retaliate and cut off future student 
exchanges 
you see i think the exchanges have brought forward the reforms 
that have taken place in china if you look back over your 
shoulders for a starting point and compare it to the cultural 
revolution days some of the reforms have taken place steps have 
been taken forward and regrettably tiananmen was a step a 
gigantic step back but i want to keep contact i do not want 
isolation 
if i vetoed the bill i could take action to provide the 
students with even greater protection while keeping the door open 
for more chinese scholars to study here and the price of the 
pelosi bill is lost opportunity

president bush today called sen daniel p 
moynihans proposal for a social security payroll tax cut a 
disguise for increased taxes and said he will continue to fight 
it 
bush told a white house news conference he believes social 
security has been basically a pretty fair system and this is no 
time to change it 
moynihans proposal formally unveiled tuesday would roll back 
the social security payroll tax rate from the 765 percent it 
reached jan 1 to the previous 751 percent that would save 
workers 7 billion this year and 55 billion in fiscal 1991 
we must end the shameful practice of using social security 
revenues to finance budget deficits said the new york democrat 
the surplus in social security reserves is counted in the budget 
making the overall federal deficit appear smaller than it is 
the surplus is the result of efforts to build up reserves for 
the baby boom generation when it reaches retirement age and will 
dwindle after the turn of the century 
but the bush administration calls the move part of a democratic 
plot to raise other taxes 
i think its a disguise for increased taxes around the 
corner bush said and i dont want to to see the benefits of 
social security cut i would say to those around the country 
take a hard look now dont let that rabbit be pulled out of the 
hat 
this is a sleightofhand operation here bush said noting 
that shortly after moynihan disclosed his idea another senate 
democrat ernest f hollings of south carolina proposed enactment 
of a 5 percent national sales levy a valueadded tax 
bush said moynihan had been a member of the commission that 
restructured the social security system in 1983 i think the mr 
moynihan of a few years back ought to talk to the mr moynihan of 
today he said 
if we were all starting over i think we could finetune the 
entire american tax system bush said were not starting over 
and i think that system has been in and out over the years 
basically a pretty fair system 
on another budget front sen richard bryan dnev introduced 
legislation he said would release more than 105 billion in 
highway money being held in the federal highway trust fund 
the money represents the accumulated difference between revenues 
larely from the 9centagallon gasoline tax and federal 
highway authorizations critics say the money is deliberately 
underspent to keep the deficit low and provide a cheap source for 
government borrowing 
over the last decade the federal government has used the money 
collected by the federal gas tax as a deficitreduction gimmick 
bryan said 
legislation to elevate the environmental protection agency to 
cabinet level status was introduced in the house and senate with 
supporters saying they hoped a bill could clear congress within 
several months 
bush gave his endorsement to that proposal saying worldwide 
environmental challenges are so important that they must be 
addressed at the highest level 
sen john glenn dohio chairman of the senate government 
operations committee also said the epa needs more clout and higher 
visibility because of the importance of environmental issues in the 
next decade 
sens patrick leahy dvt and alan cranston dcalif moved 
to translate changes in the soviet bloc into less us military 
spending they introduced legislation to cancel the b1 stealth 
bomber program after the 15 bombers now in production are built 
recent events have made the argument against the b2 even 
stronger said leahy he said taxpayers would save 40 billion as 
a result 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo introduced a bill she has been 
touting since the us invasion of panama last month that would 
remove existing prohibitions on women serving in combat 
a bill introduced by sen christopher dodd dconn would bar 
senators from taking honoraria and limit outside earned income to 
15 percent of salary the measure would bring senate rules in line 
with those approved by the house last year

defense minister italo luder 
abruptly resigned today after the army chief of staff met with 
president carlos menem without informing him 
i gave the president my undeclinable resignation luder 73 
told reporters after a halfhour meeting with menem at government 
house 
it was the latest crisis facing menems government which has 
been beset by economic and military problems since he took office 
in july 
menem told reporters he had not decided whether to accept what 
would be the third cabinet resignation since he took office but 
the president indicated he sided with the army chief gen isidro 
caceres in the dispute 
luder imposed an unspecified sanction on caceres on tuesday 
its very possible that by this afternoon i will lift the 
sanction menem said i think in this aspect dr luder was not 
in full knowledge of the facts he did not elaborate 
caceres met privately with menem and interior minister julio 
mera figueroa on jan 17 and discussed matters of internal 
security luder said he too should have been invited 
asked why he wasnt he said in an interview broadcast this 
morning by radio mitre i dont know 
when i called him caceres the next day he didnt give a 
satisfactory explanation said luder a lawyer and career 
politician 
neither menem nor luder specified caceres sanction but it 
could have ranged from a disciplinary hearing to arrest in any 
event caceres almost certainly would have been forced to resign 
an army expert said 
there was no immediate response from caceres who helped the 
government of thenpresident raul alfonsin put down the villa 
martelli army insurrection led by then col mohammed seineldin in 
december 1988 
though the uprising was quelled and seineldin forced into 
retirement the army remains divided between a nationalist sector 
that wants a greater say in politics and the sector led by caceres 
that has stayed out of politics 
we believe that the solution to argentinas problems should 
come from the political parties the political leaders 
caceres said last month 
luders resignation comes at a time when the government has 
failed to solve several problems in the military including low pay 
for soldiers poor equipment and a budget so small that the number 
of conscripts this year was reduced 
there was little indication beforehand that luder and caceres 
were at odds although caceres had complained about the militarys 
low budget and had spoken of the climate of social unrest in this 
south american country that is beset by inflation and recession 
also caceres publicly called for the release from prison of 
four former commanders of the military juntas that ruled argentina 
from 1976 to 1983 
two former presidents and generals jorge videla and roberto 
viola were convicted of human rights abuses committed during the 
socalled dirty war on leftist subversion 
a government commission reported in 1984 that at least 8960 
alleged leftists were arrested and presumed executed by the 
military 
the generals and three other officers convicted at the same time 
were not included in a presidential pardon in october of officers 
and alleged leftwing terrorists menem said the pardon was 
necessary for national conciliation 
since he took office menem has faced a series of crises most 
of them economic in that time he has had three economic ministers 
and three central bank presidents quit 
menem has promised to combat argentinas chronic economic 
stagnation by curtailing a budget deficit that is seen as the prime 
cause of inflation attracting foreign investment and selling 
stateowned moneylosing companies 
but interest rates have topped 600 percent a month and dollar 
buying has been rampant 
the austral argentinas currency lost nearly 50 percent of its 
value in december and there was widespread panic buying and 
hoarding by shoppers 
from december to jan 3 the government six times ordered banks 
and foreign exchange houses to remain closed to hold down inflation 
and stabilize the austral

two moslem teenagers banned from 
school for wearing religious head scarves were allowed to return to 
class today and they received a rousing welcome from their 
classmates 
fatima and aisha alvi trudged up the snowcovered driveway at 
altrincham grammar school for girls near manchester to be greeted 
by their friends who leaned out of windows and cheered them in 
fatima 15 smiled and said all we want to do is get back to 
school and back to work her 14yearold sister said we are 
glad it is all over 
the girls had been sent home every school day since dec 14 when 
they began wearing their scarves to school islamic law requires 
girls past puberty to cover their heads in the presence of men who 
are not close relatives three men teach at the school of 727 
students and there is a male caretaker 
the school argued the scarves were a safety danger to the girls 
in school laboratories and the gymnasium 
after a twohour meeting tuesday night school governors changed 
their minds but said the scarves must be blue to match the schools 
uniforms and must be removed during science and physical education 
classes because of the safety concerns 
in october three moslem girls in creil north of paris were 
banned from school because they refused to remove their scarves 
frances state school system bans all outward signs of religion 
the dispute caused public demonstrations and became a national 
political issue frances highest administrative authority the 
council of state ruled in november that moslem girls may wear 
scarves to school as long as it causes no disruption

have a healthy baby and win a prize 
thats the message behind the healthy baby lottery an effort to 
get women to seek prenatal care early in their pregnancy 
the blackstone valley perinatal network and pawtuckets memorial 
hospital with a 15000 grant from the march of dimes will kick 
off the lottery feb 1 
the program seeks to encourage women especially poor women to 
seek health care in the first three months of pregnancy when the 
fetus is especially vulnerable to damage from drugs disease and 
poor diet 
we know of no other program in the country like this said 
dr larry culpepper of the hospitals department of family medicine 
and the brown university medical school 
the lottery is open to any woman who is less than 12 weeks 
pregnant lives in central falls or pawtucket and seeks prenatal 
care from a doctor in one of those cities 
up for grabs will be six monthly prizes ranging from 25 to 
100 with winners names drawn from entry forms women fill out in 
their doctors offices 
women who keep all doctors appointments throughout their 
pregnancy will be eligible for a 500 grand prize awarded every six 
months 
if the twoyear project is successful the lottery may be 
expanded statewide culpepper said tuesday 
from the march of dimes funding 7000 will go toward prizes 
and the rest for administration and publicity the agency which 
fights birth defects chose pawtucket and central falls because of 
the high concentration of poor people and minorities 
for every 1 we spend on prenatal care we save 3 by 
preventing sickness and prematurity said bernadette m farina 
executive director of the organizations rhode island chapter 
culpepper said there are higher rates of prematurity birth 
defects cerebral palsy mental retardation stillbirth and infant 
death when the mother does not see a doctor in the first 12 weeks 
of pregnancy 
he said poor women teenagers single women recent immigrants 
and minoritygroup women are least likely to seek prenatal 
treatment 
organizers were worried initially about the propriety of using a 
lottery for health promotion but the prospect of reaching a 
hardtoreach group took precedence culpepper said 
we decided to take the risk that it would come across as a 
little tacky he said

president bush said today he hopes soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev not only survives but stays 
strong in the face of crises triggered by a separatist rebellion 
in the soviet republic of azerbaijan and ethnic unrest in the 
baltics 
bush told a news conference gorbachev is being challenged by 
an internal problem of enormous dimensions 
asked if the soviet president had gone too far in trying to 
quell the violence in azerbaijan bush said any time you have a 
use of force and the loss of life we are concerned but i dont 
believe i can judge that question right now 
soviet troops killed dozens of people saturday in storming the 
capital city of baku to end bloody ethnic clashes that erupted jan 
13 with antiarmenian rioting after 11 days of violence the 
official death toll stood at 170 
the uprising is considered the most serious crisis for gorbachev 
in his five years as soviet leader 
while expressing support for the soviet leader bush declined to 
predict whether gorbachev would survive the test 
we dont really know it is serious bush said 
he said the soviet leader has always indicated a desire to 
restrain for peaceful change inside the soviet union but i 
dont know about his future i cant make predictions about that 
but i know that i hope that he not only survives but stays 
strong because i think it is in our interest that perestroika 
gorbachevs program of economic and political restructuring 
succeed and go forward bush said 
he restated the longheld position that the united states does 
not recognize the incorporation of the baltic states of latvia 
lithuanian and estonia into the soviet union 
however bush said what i say that we want to do is to 
encourage mr gorbachevs stand that peaceful change is the order 
of the day and hes sorting out some very difficult internal 
problems in these three baltic countries 
i dont think it helps facilitates things for us to fine 
tune all that bush said they know our position he added 
saying it was a subject that he discussed with gorbachev during 
their summit in malta in early december 
in looking at the soviet scene there he is still adhering as 
best he can to the concept of peaceful change in the baltics and 
thats got to dominate bush said

a question on the use of force by soviet authorities attempting to 
put down civil disorder in the distant region of azerbaijan but

anytime you have a use of force and a loss of life we have 
concern but i dont believe i can judge that right now he said

his news conference with republicans in the senate in hopes of 
sustaining his veto there on thursday 
congress has upheld each of bushs previous ten vetoes bush 
said he had taken steps to provide protection to chinese students 
studying here at the time of the crackdown in tiananmen square last 
june not one was sent back bush said of the students they 
were safe then and they are safe now and they will be safe in the 
future 
he said the legislation was unnecessary and suggested it invited 
retaliation against american scholars in china

beijing favor legislation anyway to give automatic visa protection 
to the estimated 32000 chinese students in the united states 
meeting with reporters four days past his first anniversary in

a painting by vincent van gogh loaned to the 
metropolitan museum of art in 1984 will leave the museum to be 
auctioned for an expected price of up to 50 million christies 
auction house says 
the painting portrait of dr gachet is from the collection 
of siegfried kramarsky a germanborn new york banker who died in 
1961 it is being sold by a trust created under his will 
museum director philippe de montebello said he was not surprised 
that such a painting was headed for the auction block the 
reduced tax advantages to collectors and the increased sale 
potential are a combination that is irresistible to collectors and 
fatal to museums he said 
the portrait of dr paulferdinand gachet was painted six weeks 
before van gogh committed suicide in 1890 
it will be auctioned may 15 almost precisely 100 years after it 
was finished 
gachet a practitioner of homeopathic medicine was van goghs 
physician and a friend of impressionist painters the doctor an 
artist himself is shown seated at a table head in hand with what 
van gogh called the brokenhearted expression of our time 
van gogh painted a slightly larger version with less detail and 
flatter colors it hangs in the musee dorsay in paris 
another van gogh irises was sold at auction in 1987 for 
539 million making it the worlds most expensive painting that 
sale however was made with a loan from sothebys auction house 
when the buyer failed to pay what was owed the deal fell through

if i vetoed the bill i could take action to provide the 
students with even greater protection while keeping the door open 
for more chinese scholars to study here and the price of the 
pelosi bill is lost opportunity for the chinese scholars of 
tomorrow and people should understand that very very clearly 
the bill is totally unnecessary the longterm policy 
consequences are potentially great and congress in my view will 
have only itself to blame 
i can understand their emotion but weve got to look at policy 
and weve got to be fair in what has already been accomplished by 
the executive order its a strong message i want it to be seen 
exactly that way 
and now id be delighted to take any questions terry and then 
helen 
q mr president how serious a crisis is the nationalist 
rebellion in azerbaijan for president gorbachev and what are the 
chances that hell survive this test and the challenge from the 
baltics 
a well i think the answer to your question unfolds every day 
we dont really know and it is serious the gorbachev has always 
indicated a desire to restrain for peaceful change inside the 
soviet union and i refer to what he said on the baltics hes 
faced with an ethnic problem here and an internal problem of 
enormous dimensions 
but i dont know terry i cant make predictions about that 
but i know that i hope that he not only survives but stays strong 
because i think it is in our interest that perestroika succeed and 
go forward 
q well can i just follow up on that 
a sure 
q do you think that hes gone too far in the crackdown in baku 
a any time you have a use of force and the loss of life we are 
concerned but i dont believe i can judge that question right now 
q mr president youre very concerned with drugs and drugs are 
intimately connected now to guns what is it what do you tell 
your grandchildren in why you would ban semiautomatic foreignmade 
guns and not domestically produced there are two students who were 
killed in the last 10 days high school students here arent you 
deeply concerned i mean where is the lethal legal justification 
a i am concerned and i just dont happen to believe the banning 
of weapons will take them out of the hands of the criminals and 
weve seen state law after state law violated by the bad guys 
getting the weapons and i believe that so i dont want to go for 
more federal gun control im not going to do it weve taken some 
steps that i think are helpful 
q well we are sending weapons though to colombia and so 
forth that are made in this country how do you stop that 
a to colombia 
q and to other places where theyre getting in 
a well if theyre going to the colombian government i 
wouldnt stop it and if theyre going to the bad guys we would 
undergo every possible follow every possible avenue to stop it 
yes 
q mr president back on china for a moment it appears your 
veto will be overridden in the house today that would require 
senate action for the job to be complete i know you met with 
senate leaders this morning are you confident that just these 
remarks youve made out here today and whatever else you may have 
said will be enough or do you really feel that the chinese 
leadership with whom you have dealt for so long kind of let you 
down here and didnt give you a strong enough hand 
a what i did in talking to the senate leaders this morning 
the republicans is to cite certain things that steps that china 
has taken 
theyve accepted the peace corps volunteers you see i think 
thats good people will say well in the face of tianamen 
thats not good i think it is good because i think cultural 
contacts educational contacts will benefit in the long run 
democracy and reform in china theyve accredited a voa 
correspondent who as you know were kicked out 
theyve muted the hostile propaganda against americans and 
stopped harrassing the us embassy thats good thats important to 
me as president who feels a certain responsibility for the people 
there 
theyve given some assurances on missile sales i want to see 
them follow up but i think thats positive theyve reopened the 
fulbright exchanges i think thats good and i think thats 
positive 
and i think if we let congress have its head and do what is 
emotionally popular these things would be changed theyve lifted 
martial law i dont know a single member of congress that if i 
had said to them look we think by sending general scowcroft and 
larry eagleburger over there we can get martial law lifted do you 
think its worth it i think most would have said sure that 
would be a good step

a judge has ordered a new murder trial for a 
former plumber charged with setting off the remotecontrolled car 
bomb that killed arizona republic investigative reporter don bolles 
in 1976 
james robison 67 who is in prison on an unrelated assault 
charge was scheduled for arraignment feb 2 after superior court 
judge thomas otoole ordered him tuesday to stand trial 
robison and max dunlap were found guilty in the bolles killing 
in 1977 but their convictions were overturned in 1980 because the 
defense wasnt allowed to question a witness adequately dunlap has 
not been charged again 
a third man john harvey adamson was convicted in the slaying 
and is in prison his death sentence was overturned 
the motive for the slaying of bolles 47 at a phoenix hotel has 
remained murky with a tangle of theories involving the mob race 
track owners casino skimming and crooked bankers no mastermind 
has been charged 
prosecution witnesses presented little that was new during a 
fourday preliminary hearing but attorney general bob corbin said 
tuesday nobody ever puts on all of the good stuff at the 
preliminary hearing 
robison formerly of suburban chandler did not testify but 
prosecutors introduced a transcript of an unpublished interview 
robison gave magazine writers in 1979 in which he denied killing 
bolles but acknowledged having seen the remote control and 
withholding information from police

it happens and we see a lot of criticism of it theyve released 
573 people that were detained after last junes events and you can 
argue about any one of these points 
but i asked the senate and the house a little late for that 
one the senate to take a look at these things and put it in the 
totality of a policy and you see i think there are some real 
reasons asian reasons if you will cambodia and japan that we 
should retain relations with china that doesnt mean we endorse 
the lack of human rights 
i tell you one of the criticisms that gets to me a little and 
i vowed i didnt tell you my new years resolution was not to let 
it get to me but it is the idea that i dont care about human 
rights that is absolutely ridiculous i want to see china move 
forward and some think isolation some think a railroad up there 
in the congress is going to do it and i dont think so i think 
were handling it pretty well brit 
q mr president did you in any way convey to the chinese 
leaders the idea that these steps taken so far would be enough to 
head off this action taken by congress which they must 
a we didnt give a timetable but weve encouraged in every way 
we can these and more but im just asking that people look at them 
i have not seen and maybe its my fault one account on 
whatever media of these steps put together as a package i havent 
seen one 
so id like to suggest to the congress that are debating this to 
take a hard look at this and see whether its progress whether it 
adds up to anything or as some of our critics would say its 
pure you know boilerplate yes lesley 
q mr president in the voting in the house particularly you 
seem to be conceding that thats gone for you do you think that 
theres a theres a problem of trust here with you are they 
saying they dont trust you to go forward on this student thing 
after all you told them you werent going to have highlevel 
exchanges and while you were telling them that you were sending a 
highlevel delegation do you have a credibility problem 
a but where was the exchange in that what the exchange was 
lesley was when the secretary of commerce was going to go to china 
and be in an exchange visit arranged by their commerce minister 
that was cancelled 
qyeah but they obviously thought it included highlevel 
contact the question is is 
a who were they 
q do you think you have a problem with them not trusting 
you because of that 
a no i dont think its a question of trust i think the 
students have done a very good job presenting their case to the 
congress i think theres some politics involved crass politics 
when you hear name calling when you hear people saying kowtow 
that is not the kindest word to say we have an honest policy 
difference with this president and so theres some politics 
involved in this as well 
and but i think theres some genuine feeling that these 
students have a very good case and what i want to do is make the 
case that the way to continue reforms and have reform go forward is 
not through isolation and unilateral congressional action but 
through the kinds of contacts that i foresee and through the and 
encouraging the kind of steps that have already been taken 
q you talk about the lifting of martial law what about the 
situation as it exists without the gesture are you at all 
disturbed that the repression goes on could you 
a yes im very much concerned about the status quo and i was 
terribly concerned at the time of the cultural revolution when we 
made the original contact with china and it was a good thing we 
did because you began through contacts with the west to see china 
pull out of this middle kingdom syndrome and move forward 
and i think i know enough about it that in china you get a 
couple of steps forward and then somebody steps back you know 
look at deng xiaopings own own history i think he was out three 
times and in four and some will argue well hes part of the 
problem hes now retired but the reforms particularly on the 
economic side that brought a new level of prosperity to the 
chinese people really was started by him 
so im not giving up on i mean im not accepting the status 
quo at all and china knows my position on this but its i do 
think that theres some indignation about students there is some 
feeling that im talking about the congress now theres a lot 
here of empathy with the students right here but i think theres 
also a dose of political rhetoric up there that certainly has 
diminished the other side 
and i will readily concede maybe i could have done better and 
sooner in presenting the facts of this case the attorney generals 
doing a good job telling the you know the differences between 
the pelosi bill and what weve already accomplished but i dont 
know where well come out but im going to keep on working the 
policy yes well come over here john and then charles

irancontra arms supplier richard secord today 
was sentenced to two years probation for concealing from 
congressional investigators the fact that he paid for a 13800 
security system at oliver norths home 
secord who was enlisted by north to airlift supplies to the 
nicaraguan rebels and assist the reagan administrations secret 
arms shipments to iran has already suffered enough in the scandal 
said us district court judge aubrey robinson 
secord pleaded guilty nov 8 to making a false statement to 
congressional investigators he could have faced up to five years 
in prison and a 250000 fine 
it is my judgment that there has been punishment in this 
case robinson told the retired air force major general 
secords lawyer thomas green told the judge that his clients 
life has been in tatters since october 1986 when one of the 
airplanes in norths aid network was shot down over nicaragua while 
carrying supplies for the rebels 
the shootdown which took place in the last days of a 
congressional ban on military aid to the contras led to the 
exposure of the secret resupply network overseen by north then a 
national security council aide from his offices in the old 
executive office building next to the white house 
irancontra prosecutor reid weingarten contended that secord 
should be treated more harshly than north and former national 
security adviser robert mcfarlane who also were sentenced to 
probation in the affair 
i deeply regret not being more candid with congressional 
investigators about the enterprise and north secord told the 
judge if i could correct this i certainly would i will regret 
it for the rest of my life 
the enterprise was the maze of offshore companies and swiss bank 
accounts in the irancontra scandal from which money was withdrawn 
by secord to pay for norths home security system 
green said he and secord were very pleased with the sentence 
and that secord is now in a position to get on with his life 
secord was assessed a standard 50 in court costs 
weingarten told the judge that secord unlike north and 
mcfarlane had the benefit of personal legal counsel before making 
his false statement to congressional investigators which occurred 
in 1987 after the irancontra scandal had had come into public view 
north was convicted of three crimes including aiding and 
abetting an obstruction of congress in 1986 in connection with a 
shipment of hawk missiles to iran in november 1985 
mcfarlane pleaded guilty to four counts of withholding 
information from congress in connection with inquiries about 
whether secret assistance was going to the contras 
weingarten also urged judge robinson to consider the fact that 
north and mcfarlane committed their crimes in the context of their 
feeling that they had a higher duty 
north and mcfarlane were cases of misguided patriotism said 
weingarten while we think general secord has no such defense 
the best that can be said of secords false statement is 
that he was motivated by the embarrassment of having paid for 
norths home security system said the prosecutor 
the worst that can be said is that he was trying to avoid 
the consequences of providing benefits to colonel north said 
weingarten 
this is the stuff of routine felonies said the prosecutor 
secord is the fifth person sentenced in the irancontra affair 
no one has been given any jail time 
in court papers irancontra prosecutors noted that secord had 
been quoted as saying recently that the governments version of the 
facts in the case was asinine and that arthur liman chief 
counsel to the senate irancontra committee was a sleaze 
while the government does not dispute that the defendant has 
suffered as a result of this case it observes that his fall has 
not been accompanied by any public contrition said the court 
filing the article in which secord was quoted appeared in the 
january issue of vanity fair magazine 
in allowing secord to plead guilty the government agreed to 
drop its prosecution of him on 11 other charges including 
allegations he lied to congress by denying he made more than 1 
million in profits 
secord who has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors has not 
recanted or modified much of the testimony regarding his 
financial activity said a court filing tuesday by irancontra 
prosecutors secord testified he made only his 6000amonth 
salary in the affair 
the prosecutors urged robinson to find a sentence that 
balances the significant good the retired air force general has 
done in the past with the need to reemphasize that our system of 
government will not tolerate intentional disrespect for the 
telling the truth while under oath 
secord denied the differences with prosecutors concern a 
significant portion of his congressional testimony 
by our count only about a dozen of his answers were even 
contested by the government secords lawyers said in a court 
filing 
they said the government was trying to circumvent the plea 
bargaining agreement in which prosecutors said they would not 
recommend a specific sentence 
it is fundamentally unfair for the government to implore this 
court to sentence general secord on the basis of offenses for which 
he was never convicted said his lawyers

president bush saying that environmental 
challenges are so important that they must be addressed at the 
highest level of government today endorsed elevating the 
environmental protection agency to a cabinetlevel department of 
the environment 
at a news conference in the white house briefing room the 
president backed legislation that has been introduced in congress 
with bipartisan support 
i am convinced that cabinet status will help influence the 
worlds environmental policies he said noting that many nations 
have environmental ministries 
bushs announcement represented a switch in his attitude toward 
creating a new cabinet department during his first year in office 
he had opposed expansion of the cabinet 
the epa an independent regulatory agency created in 1970 to 
enforce environmental laws would become the 15th cabinet agency 
the president met with sponsors of the legislation before 
announcing his endorsement and said he would work with congress to 
draft acceptable legislation 
bush made the announcement in an opening statement in which he 
touched on a wide range of topics 
ive decided that the environmental challenges that face 
america and the world are so important that they must be addressed 
at the highest level of government he said 
bush said epa now headed by administrator william reilly is 
one of the largest and most important regulatory agencies in the 
government and called elevation of it to cabinet status another 
step forward in support of conservation and environmental 
protection 
reilly said the elevation of epa is an important environmental 
milestone 
leaders of the house and senate government operations committees 
introduced bipartisan legislation tuesday that would create a 
department of the environment and make the epa administrator part 
of the cabinet as environmental secretary 
similar legislation has been introduced in the past but made 
little headway without support from the white house 
sen john glenn dohio chairman of the senate government 
operations committee said the epa as a regulatory agency without 
cabinet status doesnt send the appropriate signal to the rest of 
the world at a time when critical environmental issues are global 
in nature 
environmental concerns have induced every major industrialized 
nation to create a ministerial post for environmental protection 
with the only exception being the united states said glenn at a 
news conference 
sen william roth rdel another cosponsor and the ranking gop 
member on the committee called raising the epas status a first 
step to reorganizing government to face the problems of the 90s 
and the first problems of the 21st century 
in the house rep john conyers dmich chairman of the house 
government operations committee promised to push the epa bill to 
the floor as quickly as possible and said he hoped legislation 
could be ready for the presidents signature by the 20th 
anniversary of earth day in late april 
rep henry waxman dcalif said cabinet rank would give the 
epa additional cout needed to deal with other parts of the 
government on environmental issues too often epas initiatives 
have been ignored or stymied he said 
in addition to giving the epa cabinet rank the house and senate 
bills call for creating a presidential commission to examine the 
effects of current environmental laws and recommend ways to 
streamline them 
the bills also would create an agency within the new 
cabinetlevel department to assemble environmental statistics 
similar to the way the bureau of labor statistics provides 
employment and other economic data 
this legislation alone will not solve our environmental 
challenges but its an important first step in giving the 
environment the priority attention for which it badly cries out 
said conyers

q mr president given the weakness of the dollar and the 
turmoil in the financial markets and the recent poor economic 
indicators what are you going to do to calm the economy calm the 
markets and keep the economy from sliding into a recession 
a well one thing im not going to do is comment on levels of 
the market except to say that theres been a substantial increase 
over the last year and some are reading the recent couple of days 
as corrections although i gather it recovered a little bit 
yesterday and the market has always been an indicator and its 
been one thats been read quite positively 
but i dont want to get into market levels what i do want to do 
is establish sound policies and im convinced that if we can get 
the cooperation of congress that we need on reducing the deficit 
that that will go a long way not market prices but in terms of the 
fundamentals on the economy its slowed down a little theres a 
lot of prediction that it will be slow for a while and then have a 
rather robust stepup come summer 
but i dont know all i know is that weve got to not bash 
anybody but get out there and try to enact policies that will help 
keep the longest recovery in modern history going 
q you said that you felt that there was room for further 
reduction of interest rates given the need to attract foreign 
investment from overseas where rates are high how do you square 
that with your call for lower interest rates 
a you mean to attract 
q attract foreign investment to cover the us deficit and yet 
though were competing against the foreign investment 
a i think that people see us the us still regardless of 
whats temporary out there as the safest haven for investment 
anywhere in the world and i want to conduct the fiscal policies of 
this government so they will continue to see it that way john 
then charles then well take 
q going back to the vote on the chinese student visas you and 
your people have been trying to get that vote delayed is that 
because you have some indications from the chinese that they may 
soon release fang lizhi 
a no 
q and if this vote goes against you it could hurt his 
chances 
a no it is not but i dont think it will help his chances 
but i would love to see that step taken by the chinese but it 
isnt theres not a i think were reconciled to the fact that 
the vote will go forward tomorrow in the senate 
q when you try to defend your china policy one thing you never 
do is talk about the china card you seem to hate that 
expression even though when kissinger and nixon were doing it it 
was considered a master stroke of foreign policy playing the 
chinese off against the soviets if gorbachev does fall from power 
and is succeeded by men whose role model is joe stalin arent you 
going to have to play the china card too 
a i dont think you play a card i think thats 
gratuitously offensive to the soviets and to the chinese but one 
of the reasons i want to stay engaged is that there are 
geopolitical reasons to have good relations or improved relations 
even under these unsatisfactory conditions and its going to be 
hard to do because of the human rights setback 
but i want to have some contact i want to retain contact 
because as you look around the world take a look at cambodia 
take a look at japan take a look at a lot of countries in the 
pacific china is a key player and id like to think that our 
representations will have them move forward on the human rights 
side so we can have a more normalized relationship with them 
q mr president regarding the soviet union have you in the 
course of these events going on in baku or any of your senior 
people i see general scowcroft is here been in touch with mr 
gorbachev or his people to discuss how severe it is and 
a well weve had contact with them i dont remember when my 
last contact was with mr gorbachev but it didnt relate 
specifically to the baku 
q could i then follow sir to ask you to reconcile if you 
can the position that youve taken that you say you want mr 
gorbachev to survive and succeed and on the other hand you have 
areas of the soviet union such as the baltics that you do not 
recognize as being part of the soviet union and where you say you 
favor an independent pursuit of their own destiny does he succeed 
if they secede 
a well he thats again at this juncture the us position 
is well known and youve stated it correctly that we have not 
recognized the status of the baltics 
however what i say that we want to do is to encourage mr 
gorbachevs stand that peaceful change is the order of the day and 
hes sorting out some very difficult internal problems in these 
three baltic countries and i dont think it helps facilitate 
things for us to fine tune all that they know our position i 
talked to him about this incidentally at malta 
but the thing i think is that in looking at the soviet scene 
there that he is still adhering as best he can to the concept of 
peaceful change in the baltics and thats got to dominate

counts of murder and one each of manslaughter and criminally 
negligent homicide in the 1987 deaths at good samaritan hospital

you had no right to usurp gods function said judge alfred 
tisch each of those patients had a right to enjoy in their own 
way every day that was available to them 
angelo told police he injected patients so that he could revive 
them at his trial the prosecutor called him a monster in nurses 
whites 
the most dramatic testimony against angelo came from one of his 
victims who survived an injection 75yearold gerolamo kucich the 
yugoslavian immigrant told the jury that angelo gave him an 
injection saying it would make me feel better minutes later

q mr president president jaruzelski of poland recently 
suggested that the four big powers reconfirm or reaffirm the 
frontiers of poland irrespective of whatever happens to germany 
would the united states join such a reconfirmation of the frontiers 
a well we have recognized under helsinki existing borders and 
i have no problem reiterating that but whether that requires some 
kind of some kind of an international action on it i just have 
no judgment on that yes 
q mr president havel of czechoslovakia proposed yesterday a 
summit in prague between mr gorbachev and you do you think its a 
good idea 
a listen i respect him so much and i dont just give him the 
back of my hand but weve got a summit set and we have a very 
critical agenda that i want to see met goals that i want to see 
met and so i think at this time that suggestion is not going to 
work out the way he suggests 
but i was rather moved by the suggestion and by the conditions 
that make the suggestion possible who would have dreamed this a 
year ago that the conditions inside czechoslovakia would give them 
less than a you know or would give him the freedom to make this 
kind of suggestion and have it rather i was rather moved by it 
but i dont believe its going to work for this summit ann 
q mr president youve opposed the moynihan social security 
bill strongly would you endorse or work for or support a 
republican alternative proposed by congessman porter that would 
take the social security increases for this and next year and allow 
people to keep those tax increases and put them in a separate 
account 
a the porter proposal has some interesting ingredients to it i 
am not prepared to endorse it we dont have provisions for that in 
our budget proposals its worthy though of consideration of 
some study but im not prepared to endorse that no im not 
q is that not the first step to privatizing social security 
a well i dont think he would say that it is that thats the 
inevitable goal but it has certain aspects there but people are 
concerned about social security so when you have innovative 
thinking of that nature i dont want to just gun it down im not 
going to support it yes 
q mr president over the last few years there have been large 
increases in the social security tax and even though its a 
regressive tax people supported it or swallowed it because they 
were told that that was necessary to make the system solvent for 
the next generation 
but now everyone is finding out that in fact that money isnt 
there any longer and its been used for debt reduction given the 
fact that people are now realizing that this is happening do you 
think its fair to ask them to continue to pay this increased tax 
for even one month longer 
a the commission that reformed social security was well aware 
of what youve just talked about they considered it i think the 
commission included mr moynihan i may be mistaken but i think it 
did 
and they considered this point and we will have some innovative 
suggestions as we go along here as to how to compensate for this 
understandable concern on the part of some but i would for now 
for this year we will we will not alter the recommendations of 
that bipartisan commission yes 
q mr president yes could i just briefly do you feel that 
this increase was sold to people under false premises 
a no because i think these were intelligent people wrestling 
with a very very difficult problem and i cant accuse them of 
selling the commission conclusions under false cover owen and 
then ann 
q well as you know the budget deficit has been coming down 
over the past few years solely because social security surplus has 
been rising and in fact your own budget projections show 
200billionayear deficits in the indefinite future when you 
remove the social security surplus 
given the fact that you have such a large deficit in every other 
program when will you and the congress stop both bickering and 
counting gimmicks and deal with this problem that the american 
public has said for a decade 
a thank you for the endorsement of our approach owen we would 
urge that we stop bickering and go forward with the proposal that 
we come out with that i think will begin to address itself to 
maureens question that is very sound and nobodys trying to 
conceal the fact that the social security trust fund is operating 
at a surplus thats not the there wasnt any concealment by the 
speaker of the house tip oneill and others that entered into 
this you know bipartisan agreement ann

q well wait a minute inaudible your own budget proposal 
that you will unveil on monday which shows a 64 billion deficit 
in fact if you remove social security 
a but youre arguing 
q will be closer to 150 billion 
a but youre making the argument of the old argument of 
taking the social security trust fund off budget and at this 
juncture were not prepared to do that but wait till you see the 
detail and i hope youll see the american people will see 
something here that that it begins to address itself to these 
fundamentals that i think are properly being asked about anne and 
then rita 
q mr president could you confirm this weeks published report 
that there are divisions within your own immediate family on the 
issue of abortion and in particular could you confirm the widely 
held view that your own wife supports abortion rights 
a no i couldnt confirm that and i cant and the meeting 
that i read about in one of the most respected publications was 
pure unadulterated um uh laughter malarkey is the 
word i like to use it just wasnt there rita 
q mr president 
a yes 
q if i could follow up as i understand your position you now 
say that the question of abortion is one of personal choice one on 
which republicans can have diverse views and still be good 
republicans 
a ive always said that anne ive campaigned for people that 
disagree with me on on abortion 
q but my question is you say its an issue of personal choice 
and a question of conscience and yet you support a constitutional 
amendment which would remove that choice for all americans how do 
you reconcile those two 
a i reconcile that i was elected to try to fulfill the the 
platform and the programs that i that i believe in and so thats 
my personal choice but that doesnt mean i have lack of respect 
for others and that that im going to go out and not campaign 
for people that disagree with me on this issue on foreign policy 
or whatever it is and so thats how i explain it yes rita 
q mr president last time you took questions here you were 
claiming success for the capture of noriega and also that you had 
protected american lives in panama but what do you have to say to 
the panamanians about more than 200 civilians civilian 
panamanians that were killed as a result of this invasion and 
also in your aid package to panama which hasnt been announced 
yet do you plan to offer any compensation to the families of these 
people 
a well im not sure of the details on the aid package because 
we havent i havent signed off on it yet but what i say to them 
is look you lost some panamanian lives innocent life was lost 
and yet 92 percent of the people in panama strongly supported the 
action of the united states isnt that significant 
and i mourn the loss of innocent civilians in panama or anywhere 
else and certainly mourn the loss of the life of americans but 
you have to feel concerned about that but you have to look at the 
broad picture and then you have to do and im very pleased with 
the strong support from the panamanian people and then youve got 
to do whats right you have to try to help repair the wounds 
repair the damage weve got to go to the i know most of you are 
very anxious to be at the arrival ceremony out there and i have to 
be there yes 
q mr president another question thats been raised by the 
moynihan proposal is the fairness of the tax system over the past 
decade even as income taxes have come down for high paid people 
social security taxes have gone up mostly for lower and middle 
income people do you think thats fair 
a well look if we were all starting over i think we could 
fine tune the entire tax system were not starting over and i 
think that system has been in and out over the years basically a 
pretty fair system and while im here dont think ive lost 
because of some arguments political arguments on the hill that 
capital gains reduction is only for the rich i support it but the 
reason i do is that in my view it increases jobs for people 
so you have to look at what individual somebody has an idea 
that if some individual deduction that encourages say drilling 
when we are in an increasingly negative oil supply situation and 
some would say hey that favors those who go out and drill 
and i say wait a minute thats true and that may not be fair 
to some taxpayer here but the national interest is best served by 
the encouragement and development of domestic resources were all 
fat dumb and happy about our energy situation today and im not 
so theres all kinds of provisions that some will argue are fair 
or unfair 
q but sir some of your favorite economist think tanks say that 
the social security tax acts as a great disincentive to work and to 
employing people isnt that to serve the same end 
a well i think thats a legitimate complaint about some of it 
and thats one of the reasons i favor holding the line on taxes 
and one of the reasons i opposed moynihan is i think its a 
disguise for increased taxes around the corner and i dont want to 
see the benefits of social security cut 
it is odd that a republican president often accused by 
political opponents in an election year is the one that is 
protecting the sanctity of the social security benefits and i 
would say to those out around the country take a hard look now 
dont let that rabbit be pulled out of the hat by one hand and 25 
other rabbits dumped on you in another 
this is will be a very complicated situation and these this 
is a you know sleight of hand operation here and the very day 
moynihan proposed it or the next day what do we get we get the 
call from another prominent respected democratic senator saying 
raise the sales tax on everybody before we go making a lot of 
changes lets know exactly where everybodys coming from in this 
and i think mr moynihan of a few years back ought to go out and 
discuss it with mr moynihan of today because he was a part i 
believe of a social security compromise that didnt correct some 
of the injustices it made 
q mr president 
a hey listen ive got to be out there looking very strict 
here at 10 oclock 
press secretary marlin fitzwater thank you

hundreds of people demonstrated 
outside the headquarters of the governing national salvation front 
today to protest its decision to compete in national elections and 
to demand its resignation 
the biggest opposition party the national peasant party said 
it feared the front will put the communist party in power again 
and it also demanded the leaders step down 
the protests came in reaction to the fronts announcement 
tuesday that it will run candidates in national elections may 20 
previously it pledged not to field candidates 
protesters chanted communists in disguise and elections 
without the front as they gathered by the tanks and soldiers 
guarding the fronts headquarters 
the national salvation front must resign today as it cant be 
both a referee and a player the peasant party said in a 
communique read by party leader corneliu coposu to party members 
it accused the front of trying to steal the victory of the young 
people and others who fought communism and dictator nicolae 
ceausescu the front took over after ceausescu was overthrown dec 
22 he was executed dec 25 
more than 50 peasant party members jammed the hallway of the 
partys headquarters and cheered todays communique some then 
joined the demonstration at the fronts headquarters 
if president ion iliescu wanted to gain power he should 
have gotten signatures on petitions and formed a party said one 
protester engineer adrian mihalcea 
some opposition figures have alleged that members of the front 
were the same men who played roles in ceausescus communist 
government 
two weeks ago iliescu bowed to huge protests and outlawed the 
communist party but the next day he reversed the decision saying 
it had been too hasty instead iliescu said the public would get 
to decide the issue in a referendum jan 28 
last week the front canceled the referendum saying the 
questions to be on it were moot and citing time constraints 
the front said un observers will monitor the may elections 
which were delayed from april to give the 15 new or revived 
political parties more time to campaign

unarmed us cruise missile over northwestern canada on friday the 
second this week a canadian military spokesman said wednesday 
maj jan martinsen said it will be a carbon copy of a test 
flight that went as planned tuesday when a cruise missile made a 
parachute landing on a snowcovered weapons range on the 
albertasaskatchewan border 
tuesdays flight was the 14th test under a 1983 uscanadian 
agreement that allows the united states to conduct up to six tests 
a year between january and march 
the test flight tuesday ended when the missile touched down on 
the primrose air weapons range at 149 pm est three hours and 47 
minutes after it was released over the beaufort sea in the western 
arctic the missile had been flown to the launch site from an air 
force base in texas by a us b52 bomber 
the groundhugging missile followed a 1320mile route from the 
beaufort up the mackenzie valley across northeastern british 
columbia and over northern alberta to the air weapons range 130 
miles northeast of edmonton 
about 100 people gathered at the alberta legislature to protest 
tuesdays test 
audrey bath chairman of the alberta citizens anticruise 
committee criticized ottawa and the canadian military for allowing 
the test amid easing tensions between eastern europe and the west 
our world is seemingly changing towards peacemaking and we 
continue to participate in readiness towards destruction bath

the nations economy continued to grow slowly 
as it entered the new year and is expected to continue that 
expansion throughout 1990 the federal reserve board said today 
economy activity is expanding slowly in most of the nation 
with conditions somewhat stronger in the west than in the east 
the central bank said in a survey of its 12 districts completed 
jan 13 
retail sales varied during the christmas shopping period 
ranging from disappointing in boston to modest in philadelphia 
and atlanta and relatively strong in chicago minneapolis and san 
francisco 
but the report added widespread discounting generally reduced 
store profits 
manufacturing activity is generally sluggish with production 
declines in some industries autos in particular offsetting gains 
in others such as commercial aircraft and oilfield equipment 
the survey found 
several districts reported that the steel and computer 
industries among others may be bottoming out 
the survey by the feds 12 district banks was conducted in 
preparation for the feb 67 meeting of the federal open market 
committee the central banks monetary policysetting arm it was 
compiled in what is known as the beige book by the federal 
reserve bank of boston 
the slow economy has resulted from the feds battle to drive 
interest rates higher as a way of dampening demand and cooling off 
inflationary pressures 
the fed switched course last june and has permitted shortterm 
rates to drop gradually in an effort to keep the slowing economy 
from stopping altogether and falling into a recession 
but the central bank has not acted since then and just last 
week the white house broke its usual nocomment stance on fed 
activities and said lower interest rates are justified 
as is usual todays report by the fed carried no 
recommendations but said the outlook is for slow growth in all 
regions in 1990 some respondents expect improvement late in the 
year 
in other areas the reports summary said unseasonably cold 
weather dampened construction activity in some areas but real 
estate markets generally held steady cold or dry weather also 
adversely affected citrus vegetable and winter wheat crops other 
agricultural and resourcerelated sectors did moderately well

japans first lunar probe lifted off 
today billowing clouds of smoke and carrying japanese hopes of 
becoming the third nation to reach the moon 
launch officials said the unmanned musesa satellite separated 
from the rockets several minutes into the flight as planned 
mission chief hiroki matsuo said data from the satellite picked 
up by tracking stations in california and australia showed it was 
orbiting the earth at a maximum distance of 186000 miles compared 
with an eventual goal of 310000 miles 
the slender m3s2 rocket disappeared into the night sky over the 
pacific ocean from its launch pad nestled between mountains on 
japans southern coast 
the rocket blasted off on schedule at 846 pm 646 am est 
if successful the musesa satellite will be the first 
spacecraft to visit the moon since an unmanned soviet vehicle 
landed on its surface in 1976 only the united states and the 
soviet union have sent spacecraft to the moon 
originally set for tuesday the liftoff was postponed with only 
18 seconds to go after an electrical switching problem cut off 
power to a hydraulic pump used to aim the nozzle of an auxiliary 
booster rocket 
matsuo said tuesdays delay was the first time in five launches 
of the solidfuel m3s2 that the countdown had been stopped in the 
final 60 seconds 
the threestage redandsilver m3s2 rocket which cannot lift 
much more than its 400pound payload carried musesa into an 
elliptical orbit that is to bring it to within about 10000 miles 
of the moon in eight weeks 
just before crossing the moons path a smaller satellite will 
break off the musesa and go into lunar orbit and send data to the 
larger satellite on temperatures and electrical fields 
the nissan motor co japans secondlargest automobile maker 
built the threestage 62ton m3s2 engine used in the lunar 
mission 
japans first satellite was launched in 1970 musesa would be 
the 13th japanese satellite in operation 
the musesa mission is being conducted by japans institute of 
space and astronautical science one of two governmentfunded space 
agencies 
this time we are going to the moon but our objective is not 
the moon itself matsuo said our institute is getting into 
interplanetary missions in the 1990s and for that we need to refine 
our technology 
in recent years japan has achieved a respected aerospace launch 
record despite its late entry into the field low budgets 106 
billion last year and a shortage of good launch sites 
japans two main launch areas in uchinoura and in nearby 
tanagashima are only a tiny fraction of the size of space centers 
in other nations 
the institute of space affiliated with the education ministry 
focuses on scientific research while the science and technology 
agency affiliated with the national space development agency 
develops satellites and rockets for applied uses such as 
communications and weather observation 
the 12 satellites japan currently operates include two marine 
observation satellites two weather satellites four communications 
satellites and one broadcasting satellite which beams television 
programs directly to viewers homes the remainder are scientific 
or engineering test satellites 
japans trading partners have criticized it for not buying more 
foreignmade satellites and rockets at lower cost 
but the national space development agency is developing a new 
rocket the h2 which will match us soviet and european rockets 
in payload capability and be competitive in price director 
tomifumi godai said

americans no longer believe public officials public officials all 
too frequently lie 
rumors of drug abuse dogged barry for years barry 
vehemently denied the charges in a twist on the old trick of a 
troubled politician wrapping himself in the flag barry said the 
investigation of his activities was racially motivated 
only afer barry was arrested in a sting operation and only 
after he tested positive for cocaine did he admit he had a 
problem and seek treatment 
even at that barry sugarcoated his dilemma saying i spent 
so much time doing for others that i have not worried enough about 
caring for myself

the phoenix gazette on the mcmartin trial 
it was the nations longest and costliest trial 
after 15 million 2 years of testimony 124 witnesses 2000 
exhibits and 100000 pages of transcripts the defendants were 
acquitted of 52 charges the jury was unable to reach a verdict 
on 11 others 
californias mcmartin preschool molestation story was a feast 
for the media almost 400 children were alleged to have been 
molested at mcmartin eight people were originally charged and 
there were more than 50 uncharged suspects in a case that 
reportedly involved a kiddie porn ring a satanic cult animals 
mutilations and torture 
in the end however there were just two defendants raymond 
buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 
after the verdicts a few jurors said that while they believed 
that some molestations occurred at mcmartin the prosecution failed 
to prove where when and by whom the prosecution in effect had 
failed and failed miserably 
media critic david shaw says the mcmartin story exposed 
several basic flaws in the way contemporary news organizations 
function pack journalism vigilantism laziness superficiality 
cozy relationships with prosecutors a competitive zeal that sends 
reporters off in a frantic search to be first with the latest 
shocking allegation responsible journalism be damned 
shaw may never get a conviction on those charges but it seems 
clear that shoddy workmanship can be traced to many professions in 
the mcmartin case and that the nations longest and costliest trial 
will be remembered for little else

the peninsula daily news port angeles wash on congressional 
ethics 
in eastern europe 1989 may have been a great year for 
democracy but on capitol hill the democratic process appears to 
have taken a beating a number of congressmen were caught in 
embarrassing ethics controversies 
five senators have been accused of improperly pressuring bank 
regulators on behalf of the owner of a california thrift in 
exchange for generous campaign contributions another senator is 
accused of seeking special favors for his political allies from the 
department of housing and urban development and still another is 
accused of evading the limits on speaking fees from outside groups 
there is a positive side to all this evidence of misbehavior it 
should help those members of congress who have been trying to 
require stricter ethical conduct on the hill 
there currently are efforts to impose spending limits on 
congressional campaigns and curbs on political action committee 
donations the opposition to such reforms has to have been weakened 
by the previous years unhappy revelations

the world coos bay ore on health care 
in a glimpse of where public health care may well be headed in 
the future federal health officials issued a report that is 
fairly easy to interpret 
nine preventable chronic diseases are responsible for more than 
half the deaths in this country but only 2 percent of the public 
health care dollars are spent for prevention of those deaths 
the problem of course is in the nature of the diseases and 
their prevention they tend to be illnesses brought on by personal 
habits that are hard to break stroke heart disease diabetes 
obstructive lung disease lung cancer breast cancer cervical 
cancer colorectal cancer and cirrhosis of the liver 
to prevent them or at least reduce their impact on death rates 
in america we need to stop smoking tobacco get our weight under 
control exercise more drink less and watch what we eat 
we have to find out what makes us so willing to spend 
thousands of dollars on radiation therapy or surgery or special 
treatments but unwilling to take the time or trouble or expense to 
prevent the problem in the first place

clearly oat bran is mired in a sticky controversy over its

after all the hoopla about oat bran lowering cholesterol new

oat bran products are now accused of misleading the consumer 
to be sure this binge of selling processed foods with 
exaggerated health claims has been way overdone but lets not 
forget who started the oat bran fad it wasnt the cereal makers 
it was doctors 
the medical community could do a better job of policing itself

the newsherald panama city fla on the economy 
how are economic prospects for the 1990s even though the 
economy is chugging along in its eighth year of expansion rep lee 
hamilton chairman of the joint economic committee of congress 
thinks prospects are bleak 
summarizing his committees position he writes while we have 
been successful in reducing unemployment without reviving 
inflation we have not improved our prospects for longterm growth 
or spread the benefits of growth fairly among our citizens 
say what cutting inflation and putting people to work is no 
mean feat and its odd for a member of the house of 
representatives which just voted itself a taxfunded 35 percent 
pay raise to be worried about spreading growth fairly 
this hypocritical rhetoric is but a prelude to we cannot 
eliminate the deficit without a moderate tax increase we cannot 
grow out of the deficit 
spur the economy through a capitalgains tax cut 
a tax cut not a stifling tax increase is the ticket to 
prosperity in the 1990s

farmington nm daily times on drugs 
the bush administration and colombian leaders are wise to give 
little credence to an offer by drug bosses that would they say 
end the bloody drug war being waged in the latin american country 
in recent days members of the medellin cartel have said they 
want a truce in the drug war that has resulted in the deaths of at 
least 209 people since last august in exchange the 
extraditables as they are also known seek complete amnesty 
as the saying goes if it sounds too good to be true it usually 
is the drug lords offer indeed sounds too good to be true 
its hard to believe they intend to so easily give up the 
extremely lucrative drug trade 
to agree to the amnesty demands would be a slap in the face of 
the direct and indirect victims of their terrorism and drug 
dealings 
and should they be granted amnesty it can almost be guaranteed 
the cartel would soon again be dealing drugs with impunity

orange county calif register on the armeniaazerbaijan 
conflict 
president george bush has given qualified support to the 
soviet invasion of azerbaijan the red army invaded after 
two weeks of the majority azeris who are moslems killing minority 
armenians who are christians 
but theres more to this than the soviets wish us to know as 
has been revealed by gary kasparov the world chess champion and 
one of the most independent figures in the soviet union he is also 
a native of baku the azerbaijani city the red army just conquered 
and the son of a jewish father and an armenian mother 
kasparov also noted that most armenians had already been 
evacuated by the time the red army assaulted baku reports the ap 
therefore he said he believed the military action was intended 
to crush the azerbaijani independence movement not stop the 
killing as soviet president mikhail gorbachev said 
what we may have here is a classic soviet ploy stir things up 
among minority peoples the kbg has been there all along then 
paint the red army massacre as a rescue while getting gullible 
western leaders to approve 
bush should reverse himself and call on moscow to grant 
independence to azerbaijan armenia and all other captive nations

bridgeton nj evening news on the armeniaazerbaijan conflict 
some europeans exuberant over the thought that they are 
breaking free of the soviet government have mistaken freedom for 
license 
the result is chaos developed in armenia and neighboring 
azerbaijan where christians and moslems suddenly began slaughtering 
each other 
what is going on in the absence of any government restraint is a 
conflict of religions not of governments nonetheless it will 
doubtless result in a serious crackdown by soviet authorities it 
should 
the armenian christians and the azerbaijanian moslems must 
understand that true democracy allows the practice of both beliefs 
to continue beside each other

more than one pair of eyes popped at nasas projected price tag 
for missions to mars and the moon 15 billion to 20 billion a 
year for 25 years now some space experts are questioning whether 
nasa has gotten too bureaucratic and hidebound to do the job 
vice president dan quayle head of the national space council 
gave the agency a tweaking in a recent speech nasa he said has 
not done as well as it could have in marshaling the resources and 
the leadership necessary to keep us ahead in space 
while rejecting the idea that nasa be replaced quayle 
recommended loosening the agencys monopoly on space by reaching 
out to universities private businesses and even other government 
agencies in a search for new ideas and methods 
one privately developed idea for example is using lighter 
inflatable material in constructing space stations cutting 
expenses and time 
there are drawbacks to the plan and it may never be used but 
it illustrates the fact that the freshest ideas are generated 
outside government nasa should take quayles friendly suggestions 
to heart as much as any federal agency it can use those fresh 
ideas

the daily times primos pa on the ncaa 
its sad to see that college athletics has put the pigskin ahead 
of the sheepskin in the easing of academic requirements for 
scholarship athletes 
the ncaa recently caved in to pressure from the powers that be 
georgetown basketball coach john thompson and temple coach john 
chaney to name a couple and ripped the guts out of a yearold 
restriction on financial aid to new athletes who dont fully meet 
academic requirements for scholarships 
it was only last year about this time that the ncaa designed 
proposition 42 which would have banned all scholarships and other 
aid for freshman athletes who meet only part of grade and 
testscore minimums created three years ago under another measure 
called proposition 48 
under proposition 48 partial qualifiers could receive full 
scholarships while only having to sit out their freshman year 
prop 42 was a good thing because it told prospective college 
athletes that they would have to study and isnt that what college 
is supposed to be all about 
thompson claimed that prop 42 discriminated against 
underprivileged and minority students 
we find that hard to swallow considering that college entrance 
standards for athletes have always appeared to be considerably 
lower than those set for nonathletes 
and now with the further relaxing of such minimal standards in 
this latest measure which has become known as proposition 26 
colleges will be discriminating against underprivileged and 
minority applicants who just might not happen to play sports

leaders in both parties predicted a big bipartisan vote today to 
override bushs nov 30 veto of legislation potentially extending 
the stays of thousands of chinese students in the united states to 
shield them from political reprisals at home 
bush today pleaded anew with lawmakers to let his veto stand 
saying the students are safe now and will be safe in the future 
describing a meeting he had with senate republicans bush said 
he sought to point out steps the chinese have taken to ease 
relations with the united states such as accepting peace corps 
volunteers muting hostile propaganda against americans and 
easing harrassment of the us embassy where a prominent chinese 
dissident has been in hiding 
i ask the senate and the house to take a look at these things 
and take into account the totality of the policy the president 
said i think there is some indignation about students in 
congress but i think also theres a dose of political rhetoric up 
there 
senate minority whip alan simpson rwyo said he believed bush 
had been persuasive and had pulled to within six or seven votes of 
the 34 he will need to maintain his position when the senate votes 
as early as thursday he said his comments of a day earlier 
conceding defeat on the issue were just exaggerating 
the senate began its year on tuesday debating an issue left over 
from 1989 clean air legislation that is more farreaching and 
costly than bush wants other thorny issues left over from the 
101st congress lackluster first session loom ahead as well 
including child care parental leave bushs capital gains tax cut 
and the federal budget deficit 
the call to order brought the capitol out of a twomonth winter 
rest with friendly reunions a flurry of bill introductions and 
speeches and optimistic predictions for the year ahead 
rep jack brooks dtexas led the pledge of allegiance in the 
house and received hugs and a long standing ovation brooks had a 
brush with death during the holidays while hospitalized for 
pancreatitis 
and a new house member was sworn in rep craig washington wiped 
away tears after he took the oath to succeed rep mickey leland 
dtexas who died last year in a plane crash in ethiopia a day 
earlier a judge back in texas sentenced washington to 30 days in 
jail for contempt of court accusing him of leaving legal clients 
in the lurch 
as it faces a new year congress and the president will have to 
confront a dramatically changing relationship with the soviet union 
and its implications for us defense spending and relations with 
eastern europe 
house speaker thomas s foley promised the new session of 
congress would be more productive than the last including passage 
of campaign finance reform and he said lawmakers will give careful 
study to a proposal by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny to cut 
social security taxes 
on the chinese students issue bush was making his fight in the 
senate where he hoped to win the 34 votes needed to prevent a 
twothirds majority for an override republican senators were 
invited to the white house for breakfast today for a personal 
lobbying session with the president 
lobbying on capitol hill monday secretary of state james a 
baker iii warned republican senators a veto override could lead to 
a cutoff of the flow of chinese students to the united states and a 
shutdown of cultural exchanges 
the bills sponsor rep nancy pelosi dcalif said her only 
motives in seeking an override vote were to offer irrevocable 
protection to as many as 32000 students and to send a clear signal 
of disdain for beijings crackdown last june on prodemocracy 
demonstrators 
simpson criticized democrats for using the bill as a political 
blunt instrument in an effort to pare down the high approval 
ratings bush has achieved in the polls following the us invasion 
of panama 
meanwhile moynihan formally introducing his social security 
tax cut proposal said the administration is deceiving workers 
because the excess social security taxes being collected from them 
are being used to make the federal deficit appear smaller 
these are insurance contributions they are premiums paid 
moynihan told a news conference they do not belong to the 
government if we are not going to save them we should return 
them 
his bill which has drawn widespread interest but few sponsors 
would roll back the tax increase that took effect jan 1 and reduce 
another increase scheduled for next year that would save a worker 
with income over 51300 about 600 and leave the social security 
system with just enough money to pay retirees checks moynihan 
said 
the bush administration says such cuts would lead to reductions 
in benefits or to efforts to raise other taxes the senate finance 
committee has scheduled hearings on the issue for feb 5 and 8

simultaneously broadcast an antidrug program picking up at least 
threequarters of the people watching tv 
the locally produced program texas crackdown was shown 
tuesday on all three major network affiliates in the dallasfort 
worth area and one independent station and was accompanied by a 
radio version on three stations 
dallas and fort worth newspapers joined the effort with drug 
quizzes in their tuesday editions and teachers assigned light 
homework so students could watch the show 
many schools planned quizzes and school projects based on the 
program a nonprofit group sponsored an essay contest for 
students based on the program 
wfaa an abc affiliate aired the program with cbs affiliate 
kdfw nbc affiliate kxas and independent kdtx three 
spanishlanguage radio stations kessam kssaam and kssafm

nielsen ratings showed that 75 percent of the people watching 
television in the dallasfort worth market watched texas 
crackdown on the network affiliates at 9 pm said wfaatv

midto upper 60s for the three network affiliates lane said 
the independent stations ratings were not available in the 
overnight reports he said 
although the programs were sponsored by local hospitals and 
dominos pizza there were no regularly scheduled commercials the 
time block cost the stations an estimated 1 million

end the peaceful demonstration in pristina the provincial capital 
the witnesses told the associated press

toward vranjevac a predominantly ethnic albanian suburb of 
pristina where sporadic demonstrations were reported to be 
continuing 
the witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity 
the crowd consisting mainly of university students and 
construction workers had gathered to demand that authorities end 
the state of emergency and halt what they say are political trials 
police brutality and the detention of political prisoners a 
smaller protest with similar demands occurred in pristina on 
tuesday

antialbanian discrimination and called for free elections in 
kosovo said the witnesses

resignation of rahman morina the provinces communist leader and 
ju suf karakusi the police chief whom they accuse of human rights 
abuses 
hundreds of workers in several major kosovo companies staged 
support strikes during the day the state news agency tanjug

yves saint laurent won a long standing ovation 
wednesday as he waltzed down the runway kissing his models after a 
show of summer haute couture featuring clean colorful classics as 
only he can make 
the crowds enthusiasm contrasted with tuesday nights debut of 
readytowear wizard claude montana as haute couturier for the 
celebrated house of lanvin a sad moment in which montana seemed 
out of his element 
yves saint laurent was more to the couture point said 
fashionable paloma picasso i loved his evening wear with so 
many ideas and such fabulous color combinations as usual 
saint laurents day wear was both striking and wearable it 
centered on sharp white ivory or navy ottoman or shantung suits 
including sleek pants or short skirts with tailored jackets 
disregarding fashion critics who tell him to discard shoulder 
pads saint laurent still shows his daytime clothes neatly padded 
out to give shape but the blouses underneath have softer shapes in 
scoopnecked satin or organza models with cap or raglan sleeves 
he dedicated many models to past or present entertainment stars 
some looked downright odd like the frogbuttoned black gazar coat 
over a pants suit dedicated to rita hayworth 
but his homage to his home in morocco was a simple white satin 
sheath topped by a stunning jacket that made the dress engineered 
by master embroiderer francois lesage it was an extravaganza of 
mirror sequins beads and crystals 
in easytowear daytime lines saint laurent turned out a soft 
midnight blue silk chemise dress with big white buttons and several 
silk shirt waists in junglepanther prints 
his faultless use of fabric and color went from slinky little 
cream satin mademoiselle de paris short tea dresses to a fresh 
blue plaid organdy dance dress with puffy sleeves and deep 
decollete 
montana by contrast lacked the elegant elaboration of haute 
couture it was pure montana tersely commented ellin saltzman 
corporate fashion director of rh macy inc 
not that the clothes were bad they had montanas original 
touch and the great readytowear creator of blousons put on lots 
of them in luxury fabrics such as pinklined copper satin over lean 
linen pants 
but the poor reception would seem a setback for midland bank 
which took over lanvin last year and chose montana to lead the 
couture creation some observers thought montana had done better 
collections under his own label 
the billowy white short gazar trench coats had montana 
cachet brown and earthy colors like khaki tobacco chocolate and 
clay were featured in luxury fabrics 
montana based his silhouette on lean pants and jodhpurs with 
most interest in the toppers like a striped sequined shortie duffel 
coat over navy shorts 
but the audience looked mainly perplexed with some sniffing 
that the combinations just did not make a couture look rich 
clientele who usually love lanvin are unlikely to go for the 
austere evening wear with spider web seethrough effects on top 
however lovely lateday ideas in fabulous fabrics were paraded 
at the young couture house of lecoanethemant 
the clothes were formfitting with clever draping insertion of 
elaborate lace touches under waistlines lashings of white organza 
on collars or skirt flounces adding dashes of fun 
a typical little sexy cocktail outfit paired an asymmetrical 
fitted jacket over a tiny lean coral leather skirt 
designer didier lecoanet also worked with new raffia lace trim 
and gold braid effects in the bright outfits other summery touches 
were in the motherofpearl shell embroideries 
with some cutouts revealing skin for summer plenty of bouncy 
evening wear with short skirts in front and train effects in back 
the festive outfits in light organza brocade taffeta faille and 
gazar were truly worthy of the haute couture label 
the clothes costing many thousands of dollars per outfit are 
mainly for show only about 2000 women regularly buy couture 
which is meant to power the fashion houses other activities from 
accessories to perfumes

some people insist they remember vividly where 
they were when the space shuttle challenger exploded four years ago 
sunday but ulric neisser knows theyre wrong 
and the father of cognitive psychology has their handwritten 
accounts of the day to prove it 
this really surprised me said neisser a member of the 
national academy of sciences who pioneered the psychology of how 
people handle information i suspected they wouldnt be 100 
percent accurate but i never thought theyd be this wrong 
when neisser an emory university psychology professor heard 
that challenger had exploded on jan 28 1986 killing all the 
astronauts on board he decided that surveying emory students about 
the accident could help test the accuracy of flashbulb memories 
that term coined by harvard psychologist roger brown describes 
vivid and detailed memories of important and emotional events in 
the 1970s brown wrote that events such as the assassination of 
john f kennedy are accurately recorded by a quasiphotographic 
mechanism in the brain 
the morning after challenger exploded neisser asked 100 
students to record how where and when they heard the news who 
told them and how they felt 
in the fall of 1988 and again in spring 1989 he and emory 
graduate student nicole harsch tracked down 44 of the students and 
interviewed them scoring their responses on a 7point scale of 
accuracy 
in the first interviews 11 were dead wrong and only three 
received a score of 7 
in the 1989 interviews when neisser even gave the students 
hints and eventually showed them the reports they had written 12 
students still failed completely 
he added that even those people with a score of 7 were not 
totally correct in their memories 
of the 13 students whose confidence level was highest three had 
scores of 0 and seven had scores of 2 or less only two were 
accurate 
hardly anyone remembered filling them out neisser said of 
the statements even then nobody said oh yes now i remember 
youd think theyd say that if only to be a good subject and please 
the interviewer 
some didnt want to believe it even then they said im sure 
thats wrong 
the typical response was that the student was passing a tv set 
and stopped to watch 
after all after hearing about it almost all of us sat around 
that night watching it on television neisser said they 
remember the televisionwatching experience 
the concept of flashbulb memories has been around since at least 
1899 neisser said he found an article published in an 1899 
psychological review that said a man named cole grove surveyed 
people 30 years after president lincolns assassination although 
twothirds of those claimed to remember how they heard the news 
grove said probably only onethird were correct 
neisser who will present his findings at a conference on 
flashbulb memories at emory feb 2 added that although such 
surveys have been done before his is the first to have concrete 
facts to back it up in the form of the students written statements 
now he and other psychologists some of whom are planning 
similar studies of the san francisco earthquake must determine why 
people have such high confidence in their memories neisser said 
at first it was thought that maybe the strength of the emotion 
and surprise stamps the memory into your mind in a particularly 
lasting way he said these are events they think a lot about 
talk to people about 
eventually they only remember a few fragments they construct 
a plausible story and then forget they constructed the story

the liberal democratic party distributed nearly 40 
million wednesday to help its candidates in the feb 18 
parliamentary elections which the scandalplagued governing party 
is in danger of losing 
japans largest trade union federation issued a statement urging 
voters to reject the moneyoriented politics of the liberal 
democrats who have strong support from big business 
money politics will be a central theme in the opposition 
campaign against the party that has governed japan since 1955 the 
year it was formed 
liberal democratic incumbents in parliaments lower house each 
received either 103000 or 172000 with the smaller sum going to 
wellknown politicians party sources said the total distributed 
was 386 million 
the 270 candidates endorsed so far called at party headquarters 
to pick up brown paper bags bulging with cash 
earlier wednesday prime minister toshiki kaifu dissolved the 
512member lower house in which the liberal democrats held 295 
seats to pave the way for elections 
in july the party lost its majority in the less powerful upper 
house because of an unpopular sales tax and a bribery scandal 
involving senior liberal democratic politicians 
recent public opinion polls show the governing party leading the 
opposition but if the liberal democrats lose next month a 
coalition led by the japan socialist party probably would take over 
after dissolving the lower house kaifu told fellow party 
members it was their duty to restore the peoples confidence in 
the party 
the cabinet met and decided candidates should register and 
campaigning begin feb 3 when the date of the election will be 
announced officially as feb 18 elections are required by july 
when the fouryear term of the lower house expires 
party elders apparently chose the february date to give the new 
parliament time to consider the budget which must be passed by 
april 1 
a statement issued wednesday by the governing party said 
socialist and communist nations around the world are collapsing 
like an avalanche and a victory by the outdated inflexible 
opposition would represent a return to the past 
liberal democrats pledged action on political reform and 
agricultural welfare and land policies 
kaifu said recently that if his party lost he would take 
responsibility apparently meaning he would resign as his 
predecessor sousuke uno did after the election loss in june 
opposition parties condemned the long hold on power by the 
liberal democrats 
intraldp conflicts prevented prime minister kaifu from 
addressing the diet parliament with his policies before 
dissolution the socialists said policy questions by 
opposition party leaders were also blocked 
such actions resulted from arrogant oneparty rule the 
party said and it appealed for unity behind a coalition that 
reflects the national interest and responds to radically shifting 
domestic and foreign affairs 
the komeito clean government and democratic socialist parties 
said they would hold to the center seeking abolition of the sales 
tax improvement in japans standard of living and progress in 
world peace and disarmament 
the japanese trade union confederation which has 8 million 
members said the election centers on the controversial 3 percent 
sales tax 
eishiro saito chairman of the federation of economic 
organizations which represents japans largest corporations said 
the election eould decide japans destiny in the next century 
he said japans miraculous economic growth has been based on 
stable politics championed by the liberal democrats

japan

climb further in this country to stay competitive in the 
international marketplace 
a sale by the government tuesday of 40year bonds to finance a 
rescue plan for troubled thrift institutions drew a chilly 
reception from investors 
as the outlook for interest rates has worsened investors have 
begun to face the possibility that the recent slowdown of the 
economy might deepen in the months ahead

left many traders unimpressed and disheartened

a man who set fire to his son seven years ago 
was paroled today under a veil of secrecy and orders to wear an 
electronic leash and stay away from the boy who is keeping a bb 
gun handy just in case 
charles rothenberg is out on parole and he has reached his 
destination said tipton kindel spokesman for the state 
corrections department 
rothenberg wearing an electronic device that will enable 
authorities to monitor his movements left prison shortly after 
midnight kindel said adding that rothenberg is now the 
mostwatched parolee in california history 
david rothenberg who is now 13 said he was frightened by his 
fathers release and keeps a pellet gun by his bed just in case 
id shoot his eye out if he ever came over id blind him he 
said in a recent interview 
the boy was severely disfigured by the fire set by his father in 
a custody dispute with his estranged wife 
prison officials were determined to keep rothenbergs 
whereabouts secret during his threeyear parole and wouldnt even 
confirm he was paroled within the united states 
earlier today on nbcs today show kindel said rothenberg 
will be under the strictest parole ever for a california 
parolee 
he will not be allowed to leave the jurisdiction to which he 
is being paroled he will not be able to go to the county where his 
son lives he will not be allowed to have any contact with his son 
his exwife or her current husband kindel said 
if rothenberg violates parole he will be returned to prison for 
up to a year 
david lives in orange county with his mother marie and 
stepfather police officer richard hafdahl who helped in the 
investigation of the fire 
asked on today what is being done to protect david kindel 
said that if rothenberg is ever not where hes supposed to be 
then the family david will be notified immediately 
rothenberg 49 set fire to his son in a buena park motel room 
in 1983 after a telephone argument in which his estranged wife said 
rothenberg would not be able to see the boy again 
rothenberg had taken the boy on a holiday to southern california 
from new york where the boy was living with his mother 
if i cant have him nobody else can rothenberg said when 
arrested six days later he told authorities he was going to kill 
himself but was too much of a coward 
david dragged from the inferno by motel guests suffered 
thirddegree burns over 90 percent of his body 
rothenberg was convicted of attempted murder arson and other 
charges and got the maximum a 13year prison term the sentence 
was cut in half because of good behavior 
if he had been convicted today rothenberg would have faced up 
to life in prison 
in a letter last month to the los angeles times rothenberg 
called his own release an unforgivable act 
prison officials kept the relocation plans secret fearing a 
repeat of the hysteria surrounding the 1987 release of larry 
singleton 
singleton who had raped a teenager and left her for dead after 
hacking off her forearms with an ax had to be moved repeatedly 
from northern california communities where he was rejected by an 
outraged public 
kindel acknowledged in the today interview that if 
rothenbergs location is revealed it could be a problem for the 
corrections department and said another highprofile parolee 
an apparent reference to singleton cost the state more than 2 
million to move him from location to location 
were hoping to convince the public that not only is its 
safety assured but so is the safety of david rothenburg so that 
perhaps they will simply ignore this man and shun him and not give 
him the media attention that weve learned he actually enjoys 
kindel said 
david said he would always live in fear of his father 
he will be out there free he probably has people out there 
right now looking for me i will have to live the rest of my life 
on the line always looking behind me the boy said recently

the health minister has warned that chinas high 
incidence of hereditary diseases disabilities and illiteracy is a 
threat to national development it was reported wednesday 
minister chen minzhang told a conference that china must use 
propaganda education and legislation to improve the quality of its 
11 billion people according to the china youth news and the 
overseas edition of the peoples daily 
chen said china has 51 million people with physical and mental 
disabilities about 5 percent of the population it has 22 million 
sufferers of hereditary diseases and birth defects afflict 13 
percent of babies 
congenital diseases are so serious in some remote areas where 
marriages among close relatives are common that some communities 
have come to be called deaf and mute villages or simpleton 
villages the minister said 
he said 17 percent of children under 14 are classified as being 
of low intelligence 
the nation has more than 200 million illiterates and 
semiliterates onefourth of the worlds total eighty percent of 
the illiterates are women and 40 million children almost all in 
rural areas have quit school 
chen noted that china has made significant progress in some 
areas since the communists came to power in 1949 with the rate of 
mothers dying in childbirth dropping from 150 per 10000 in 1949 to 
5 per 10000 today the infant mortality rate has dropped from 20 
percent to 35 percent 
but chen said the low quality of the population has become a 
heavy millstone around our neck in the journey to catch up with 
international competition and modernize 
he called for legislation to improve the quality of new babies 
but the reports did not say whether he was referring to 
strengthening the nations onechild policy or controversial 
proposals to prevent some women from giving birth 
northwest chinas gansu province in one of the nations most 
impoverished regions in 1988 passed a law prohibiting 
dullwitted and retarded people from having children and 
saying such people could marry only after being sterilized 
the chinese association for the handicapped last spring also 
called for a national law of eugenics to improve population 
quality

president najib said wednesday there 
was no sign the soviet union plans to cut massive military and 
economic aid to his marxist government in its war with moslem 
guerrillas 
at a news conference he reiterated a pledge to step down if he 
believed such a move would end the 11yearold civil war with the 
usbacked insurgents 
najib said that despite moscows handsoff response to the 
democratic reforms that have toppled communist governments in 
eastern europe the soviet union appears determined to continue 
helping his country 
we have not seen any sign which might demonstrate the 
unwillingness of the soviet union to fulfill its contractual 
commitment to its south asian neighbor he told foreign 
journalists 
the burly former chief of the nations secret police said his 
government already has carried out the kind of reforms that are 
transforming east bloc nations 
there are great lessons that should be learned by us all from 
the developments there najib said 
flanked by army troops carrying automatic assault rifles he 
responded to written queries submitted in advance and then answered 
questions directly from reporters security personnel frisked all 
of the reporters and searched their belongings 
najib called on the guerrillas to put down their weapons and 
talk peace 
but he added if the opposition launches more attacks our 
response will be stronger and more crushing than ever before 
the major rebel leaders based in neighboring pakistan have 
rejected any talks with najibs government 
they are fighting to topple his ruling peoples democratic party 
of afghanistan and replace it with an islamic regime 
the party seized power in a bloody military coup in 1978 najib 
assumed office in 1986 after former president babrak karmal 
resigned ostensibly for health reasons 
najib originally offered to resign for the sake of peace in 1987 
asked if the offer still stood he said if the need arises 
for stepping down i can assure you that i will sacrifice 
everything for the sake of assuring peace in my country 
an estimated 15 million people have been killed in the war and 
more than 5 million afghans a third of the countrys prewar 
population have fled to refugee camps in pakistan and iran 
soviet troops spent nine years fighting the guerrillas to a 
stalemate before moscow withdrew the last of them in february 1989 
about 100000 soldiers moved into afghanistan on dec 27 1979 
to replace one promoscow government with another and stayed on to 
fight the insurgents 
the guerrillas and many western countries predicted najibs 
government would fall soon after the withdrawal but government 
forces have held their ground they continue to hold afghanistans 
major cities and the guerrillas control most of the rugged 
countryside 
the united states britain and several other countries closed 
their kabul embassies a year ago ahead of an expected fight for the 
capital 
while the insurgents have intermittently attacked with rockets 
najibs government remains firmly in control and france recently 
announced plans to reopen its embassy 
najib said he warmly welcomes the decision 
we reiterate that the republic of afghanistan is ready to 
assure the safety and security of all foreign diplomats he said 
he denied widespread claims that his party and its security 
force known as khad have killed or tortured thousands of 
opponents in the nearly 12yearold rule of the peoples democratic 
party 
the baseless allegations against the party are only a pretext 
for avoiding talks and continuing the war he said 
najib said his formula for peace would begin with a sixmonth 
ceasefire and talks among officials of his government and 
guerrilla leaders he also said he supports the formation of a 
coalition government and elections held under international 
supervision

soviet forces today fought with azerbaijani 
nationalists who blockaded the port of baku with oil tankers to 
protest the governments military occupation of their wartorn 
republic news reports said 
soviet television reported that nationalists aboard the tankers 
attacked a marine passenger terminal in the harbor where people 
wait to board ships 
there was an exchange of fire tv said and soldiers were 
wounded it gave no further details of the harbor battle except to 
say that a group of people was later detained residents in baku 
said in telephone interviews that they had heard there was a 
40minute gun battle in the harbor 
tass reported that the blockade of the port by azerbaijani 
extremists which had lasted several days had been lifted 
however it was not clear whether the nationalists had chosen to 
end it or had been forced to do so 
before the battle the captains aboard the tankers in the 
oilproducing caspian sea port had threatened to blow up their 
vessels if the soviet military tried to break the blockade an 
activist said 
earlier today soviet troops trying to crush the nationalist 
uprising in azerbaijan arrested 43 people and seized copy machines 
from the offices of unofficial groups during overnight raids in 
baku news reports said 
the media reported growing threats against the russian 
population as azerbaijanis reacted to soviet troops sent to baku to 
restore order 
the official tass news agency said today the soviet military had 
evacuated more than 16000 soldiers dependents in the face of the 
threats 
demonstrations and strikes were banned in baku and activists 
were told they face 30 days in jail if they try to organize 
protests tass said but tass said a general strike called to 
demand the withdrawal of soviet soldiers paralyzed factories and 
transport 
the foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said 
militants continue to storm weapons depots and had stolen more than 
5000 guns and other items in the past two days in the southern 
republics of armenia and azerbaijan 
organizations that do not have formal approval to exist have 
been blamed by authorities for 11 days of violence which began 
with antiarmenian riots in baku and led to azerbaijani demands for 
independence 
fortythree people were arrested when the headquarters of 
illegally functioning informal organizations were neutralized 
tass said many copying machines and propaganda facilities were 
confiscated 
but tass said the national defense committee a militant branch 
of the azerbaijan peoples front and allied groups were banned 
mamed alizade one of the national defense committees directors 
was arrested at his home about midnight his wife said 
the peoples front the underground group that has coordinated 
much of the resistance has taken particular heat from authorities 
soviet television said gunfire continued tuesday night in parts 
of baku but activists and news reports said the city was quiet 
this morning 
the azerbaijani communist party central committee planned to 
meet late tonight said azerbaijani parliament spokesman nizami 
sakyakhov the late hour will ensure the meeting is conducted after 
curfew when demonstrators are unlikely to surround the building 
he said 
jeikhun mulazade a political scientist said the party would 
consider breaking from the soviet party in moscow the committee 
also is to elect a new first secretary to replace abdulrakhman 
vezirov who was fired after soviet troops poured into baku and met 
violent resistance mulazade said 
according to official reports at least 170 people have been 
killed since ethnic violence broke out jan 13 in baku between 
azerbaijanis who are mostly shiite moslems and armenians who are 
mainly christians azerbaijanis say the death toll is far higher 
the republics both want control over the region of 
nagornokarabakh which is populated mainly by armenians but under 
control of azerbaijan 
the violence spread from baku as armenians and azerbaijanis took 
up arms against each other in the hills around nagornokarabakh and 
on the borders between armenia and azerbaijan 
dozens of people were killed as soviet troops entered baku on 
saturday to end the violence 
the soviet soldiers are more and more often being chosen as 
targets by local fighters tass quoted interior ministry maj 
gen yevgeny nechayev as saying today 
earlier in the week there were reports of azerbaijani soldiers 
fighting their soviet colleagues but the moscowbased labor 
newspaper trud said today those reports were lies 
trud reported attacks on russians apartments in baku and said 
azerbaijanis are refusing to sell bread to russian residents about 
100000 russians live in the city of 18 million 
niayaz gajiyev of a selfappointed citizens investigation 
commission said russians are following the example of the military 
families and fleeing baku he insisted there was no real danger 
although he said antirussian sentiment is rising due to outrage 
over the troops presence 
adding to the tension was the appearance of terrorists dressed 
in military uniforms tass said 
radio moscow said negotiations between leaders of the two 
republics on how to stop the conflict continued but little 
progress was reported 
azerbaijani lawmakers on monday declared void a state of 
emergency declared by president mikhail gorbachev and they said 
they would vote to secede if soviet troops were not withdrawn 
elsewhere in azerbaijan there were reports of individual 
skirmishes but also claims of improvements

the nations economy is expected to grow 
slowly in 1990 the federal reserve said wednesday in a report that 
forecast improvements in some regions later in the year 
economic activity is expanding slowly in most of the nation 
with conditions somewhat stronger in the west than in the east 
the central bank said in a summary of its beige book 
the report did not mention any inflationary problems the 
reason the fed originally slowed the economy by driving up interest 
rates to dampen demand and cool off price pressures 
the fed switched course last june and has permitted shortterm 
rates to drop gradually in an effort to keep the slowing economy 
from stopping altogether and falling into a recession 
but the central bank has not acted since middecember and just 
last week the white house broke its usual nocomment stance on fed 
activities and said that lower interest rates are justified 
nevertheless the latest beige book report appeared to indicate 
that most participants in the feds survey completed jan 18 
thought the central bank has achieved its socalled 
softlanding continued sluggish growth but no recession 
the outlook is for slow growth in all regions in 1990 it 
said some respondents expect improvment late in the year 
the survey is conducted eight times a year in preparation for 
meetings of the federal open market committee the feds monetary 
policysetting arm the next meeting is feb 67 
looking back on the economy in recent weeks the beige book 
summary found that 
retail sales in the holiday season ranged from 
disappointing in boston to modest in philadelphia and atlanta and 
relatively strong in chicago minneapolis and san francisco 
however widespread discounting generally reduced store profits 
retailers expect flat sales or modest increases through the 
first six months of 1990 results in the first weeks of january 
were said to be encouraging 
manufacturing activity is generally sluggish with production 
declines in some industries autos in particular offsetting gains 
in others such as commercial aircraft and oilfeild equipment 
several districts reported that the steel and computer industries 
among others may be bottoming out 
most manufacturers expected slow growth in 1990 with a weak 
first half followed by gradual improvement 
unseasonably cold weather dampended construction activity in 
some areas but real estate markets generally held steady 
cold or dry weather also adversely affected citrus vegetable 
and winter wheat crops other agricultural and resourcerelated 
sectors did moderately well 
most districts discussing real estate reported steady or 
modestly improved conditions expected declines in mortgage 
interest rates provided some reason for optimism in the real estate 
outlook

wednesday 
the 10 individuals we honor here today are the real heroes of 
our age they are the thinkers and the problem solvers they 
have opened new doors and pioneered new frontiers in science and 
technology said jeffrey m samuels acting commissioner of 
patents and trademarks 
george washington carver and percy f julian were among the 
inventors selected for inclusion this year marking the first 
blacks to be selected since the hall was begun in 1973 
carver was selected for his work developing more than 500 uses 
for peanuts including cooking oil and printers ink and for sweet 
potatoes including synthetic rubber he died in 1943 
julian a chicago chemist was the first to synthesize cortisone 
and other human hormones before the synthetic cortisone came onto 
the market the only cortisone available to treat rheumatoid 
arthritis was produced from oxen bile at a cost of hundreds of 
dollars a drop 
he was one of the most persistent men i have known 
reflected samuel b massie of the us naval academy once a 
colleague of julian who died in 1975 
tenacity was also cited as a necessary ingredient by another man 
being honored 
robert s ledley of georgetown university in washington said the 
prerequisite skills for success as an inventor include a pragmatic 
attitude boldness fortitude and sticktoitiveness almost to 
the extent of obsession 
ledley was named to the hall of fame for his development of the 
computerized tomographic or ct scanner a device similar to an 
xray machine that allows doctors to see the inner workings of the 
body in great detail 
another man honored was herman hollerith described as having 
left behind a motto for the generations do not fold spindle or 
mutilate 
hollerith invented the punchcard system that helped pave the

in addition to carver julian ledley and hollerith inventors 
selected for the hall of fame for 1990 are 
graham c durant john c emmett and c robin gannellin 
medical chemists who developed the drug cimetidine which has

developed the first practical videotape 
kenneth s olsen developer of the magnetic memory core for 
computers and founder of digital equipment corporation 
eugene j houdry a frenchborn engineer who developed the 
procedure that allowed crude oil to be processed into high grade 
gasoline and aviation fuel 
the selection of 10 new members is the most since six were

a van carrying migrant farm workers ran 
off a foggy rural road and plunged into a murky canal today 
drowning 10 people and injuring two authorities said 
the driver and a frontseat passenger crawled out of the 
submerged van through windows sheriffs deputies dived into the 12 
feet of water but were unable to rescue the others trapped inside 
said lt bill chamness 
some of them had stuck their arms out trying to get out but 
they just didnt make it he said when the deputies dove in to 
get them they were already dead 
the privately owned van carrying 12 mexican migrant workers ran 
off the road at a curve near this farm community about 100 miles 
northwest of miami chamness said 
the road cuts through a sugar cane district intersected by 
numerous irrigation and drainage canals 
we think it was probably due to dense fog chamness said 
evidently they got on the curve quicker than they thought and 
instead of turning they went straight into the canal 
the survivors both men were taken to hendry general hospital 
with minor injuries such as scrapes and bruises and showed no 
immediate signs of broken bones or internal injuries said 
emergency room nurse maggie kocher 
the driver was admitted in stable condition for observation and

the top us official on 
africa said wednesday that president fw de klerk assured him 
black leader nelson mandela will be freed soon 
in an upbeat assessment of south africas racial conflict the 
us assistant secretary of state for african affairs herman 
cohen said both the whiterun government and the antiapartheid 
movement seek to negotiate a political settlement 
he said he believed the south african government had undertaken 
a commitment to make fundamental change in the south african 
political system so as to bring about democracy 
equally important is my impression that the antiapartheid 
movement is also in the process of making a reciprocal 
commitment to a negotiated solution cohen told a news conference 
cohens assessment of de klerks reforms was far more positive 
than the one offered by a us congressional delegation that 
visited earlier this month it came on the same day the state 
department criticized south african police for using force to break 
up a peaceful protest tuesday in cape town 
cohen spent three days in south africa meeting government 
leaders including de klerk and antiapartheid figures such as 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu 
cohen was asked if de klerk specified a date for mandelas 
release the countrys bestknown black leader 
he de klerk did not give me a date of release though he 
said it would be soon cohen said he said i could expect major 
developments soon 
mandela 71 has been imprisoned more than 27 years and is 
serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the 
government 
asked if he expected the government to lift the 3yearold 
state of emergency and legalize mandelas african national congress 
guerrilla movement cohen said the answer basically is yes 
since de klerk assumed power in august he has sought to ease 
political tension with a series of reforms and he called for 
negotiations with the disenfranchised black majority 
the anc says it will not negotiate until mandela and all 
political prisoners are freed political trials are halted and the 
state of emergency is lifted 
the ancs armed wing said wednesday it supports these 
conditions as set by the groups political leaders and will not 
put down its weapons until they are met 
the guerrillas are loyal to the anc and their position is no 
different if the enemy begins to show signs of seriousness to 
undertake negotiations our people will be ready to go into 
dialogue the onus is on the enemy guerrilla commander joe 
modise said in lusaka zambia where the anc has its headquarters 
the last us delegation to visit south africa was led by rep 
howard wolpe dmich who said the de klerk government was not 
prepared to establish a democracy wolpe said unless de klerk makes 
major reforms soon congress should consider additional economic 
sanctions against south africa 
the united states imposes limited sanctions under 1986 
legislation that demands south africa undertake several specific 
reforms including lifting the state of emergency legalizing 
opposition groups and freeing political prisoners 
in washington on wednesday state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler reitered these demands 
speaking of tuesdays incident in cape town in which police 
violently dispersed about 5000 black and mixedrace students 
protesting government education policies she said we deplore 
the use of force to stifle peaceful protest 
we have long urged an end to violence and repression as an 
important step in the process of change in south africa ms 
tutwiler said 
two black men were shot to death wednesday when police opened 
fire to disperse a protest alleging police brutality authorities 
said 
officers used tear gas and birdshot to disperse the protest 
after a rally by about 5000 people at a stadium in khutsong 50 
miles west of johannesburg 
members of the crowd left the stadium and began causing 
disturbances in the streets including stoning police vehicles 
police said two men were killed three were injured and 13 people

the state democratic party into turmoil by scoring an upset in the 
1986 primary for lieutenant governor

secretary of state hart and fairchild lost in the general 
election but their victories crippled democrat adlai stevensons 
effort to unseat republican gov james r thompson

defrauding an elderly woman of 80000 in cash and securities 
the larouche followers petitions were challenged by supporters

president elias hrawi will create a crack 
security force to combat terrorism in west beirut and encourage 
foreign diplomats to return to the citys moslem sector a military 
source said wednesday 
also on wednesday rival shiite moslem militias dueled with 
howitzers and rocket launchers in southern lebanon and police said 
one person was killed and another injured 
the renewed fighting in iqlim altuffah ended a 16day relative 
lull in the latest round of clashes between the proiranian shiite 
hezbollah or party of god and the shiite amal militia by police 
count 98 people have been killed and 279 wounded since dec 23 
no advances were reported by either side said a police 
spokesman who cannot be identified in line with standing rules 
the military source who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the new security force for west beirut will be made up of 400 men 
drawn from the elite combat forces of the army and police 
hrawi said tuesday that west beirut would become a security 
oasis under the security force 
all western diplomatic missions have left the city since 
mid1984 because of terrorist attacks and kidnappings of 
foreigners most of the acts were blamed on shiite moslem 
underground factions affiliated with hezbollah 
in all 18 foreigners including eight americans are missing 
and believed held hostage the longestheld is terry anderson 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press kidnapped 
in west beirut on march 16 1985 
asked whether the proposed security plan would also cover the 
slums of south beirut a hezbollah stronghold where most of the 
western hostages are believed held the military source said 
most probably south beirut will be included he refused to 
elaborate 
he said all militias will be banned from west beirut as part of 
the plan and that the commando squad will be trained on special 
assignments and might be equipped with helicopters for raid 
intervention in case it is needed to deal with special and 
sensitive assignments such as protecting foreign diplomats 
the source said a 3000man brigade from hrawis 22000member 
army will deploy in west beirut in the first stage of the security 
plan 
according to the source the security plan also calls for a 
gradual withdrawal of syrian troops from west beirut 
hrawi and syrian president hafez assad discussed the plan in 
three days of talks in damascus that ended tuesday 
hrawi on wednesday summoned army commander gen emile lahoud and

a junk dealer whose property was 
searched by fbi agents is a suspect in the mail bombings that 
killed a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer a law enforcement 
source in washington said today 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said robert 
wayne oferrell failed a series of lie detector tests administered 
by the fbi 
meanwhile court documents obtained today by the associated 
press show that oferrell once complained in a legal brief that 
americas court system is corrupt 
the letter was to the 11th us circuit court of appeals of 
which the slain judge was a member 
results of polygraph tests are not always reliable and are 
inadmissable in criminal trials it could not be determined what 
questions oferrell was asked when he gave answers the fbi 
polygraph expert considered deceptive 
on tuesday the fbi declined to comment when asked if oferrell 
is a suspect i would not comment that he is a suspect only that 
he is one of a number of people we have interviewed said fbi 
agent chuck archer 
oferrell who sued his former employer gulf life insurance 
co lost the case on appeal in april from the 11th circuit a 
member of that court judge robert vance was killed dec 16 by a 
package bomb mailed to his mountain brook home two days later a 
similar bomb killed black attorney robert robinson of savannah ga 
a letter claiming responsibility for the mail bombings was sent 
to an atlanta tv station by a person or group calling itself 
americans for a competent federal judicial system 
oferrell said today that fbi agents have not found a typewriter 
that reportedly links his typewritten court correspondence with 
typed material sent by the mail bomber 
the court documents obtained by the ap include a legal brief 
apparently typed by oferrell while acting as his own lawyer it 
states in part the law and court system in these united states 
is corrupt that i never had anything to do with but i know you 
can help clean it up if anyone has been mistreated by gulf 
life the courts and two attorneys i really believe that i 
have 
the capitalization is as it appears in the document 
oferrells father jc oferrell said the fbi had questioned 
him about the activities of another son 49yearold james 
buddy oferrell an independent trucker who lives in mckenzie 
80 miles west of enterprise 
they were trying to say my two sons had something to do with 
that bombing up in birmingham jc oferrell said they asked 
had i ever heard either one talk bad about colored folks or if my 
sons ever made threats on any judges i said no my children 
werent raised that way 
the father said the agents fingerprinted him and took blood and 
hair samples from his farm in southwest alabama 
fbi agents ate lunch with robert wayne oferrell and spent much 
of tuesday talking to him but he has not been charged 
i dont have anything to hide he said when its all over 
with ill be glad to get with the media and go into details 
oferrell said he had received a bomb threat himself monday 
night 
i know nothing about bombs how to put them together or 
anything like that he said that kind of stuff has never 
fascinated me 
federal agents used earthmoving equipment to dig up the tank 
beside oferrells rural home and dug up another tank at 
oferrells tincovered salvage store the agents refused to say 
what they were looking for 
dozens of federal officers converged on enterprise during the 
weekend 
robert wayne oferrell a tall silverhaired man lives in a 
small wooden house about five miles west of enterprise with his 
wife mary they have two daughters tammy 20 and danielle 13 
the onetime rural preacher said he asked members of his church 
to pray for my family that we can get through this thing and ive 
asked them to pray for the fbi to find whatever they are looking 
for 
they were looking for a typewriter that we may have sold 
oferrell said its possible we could have had the typewriter in 
the last two years but we dont know what typewriter theyre 
talking about you dont keep a record of everything you sell 
the fbi has speculated that the pipe bombs were sent by one or 
more white supremacists 
morris dees director of the southern poverty law center said 
oferrells name is not in the files of white hate groups that the 
centers klanwatch project maintains 
in addition to the bombs that killed vance and robinson two 
other bombs were disarmed after being found at the atlanta office 
of the 11th circuit and the national association for the 
advancement of colored people office in jacksonville fla

foreigners may soon have to pay for 
their zimbabwean brides a top law officer said wednesday 
attorney general patrick chinamasa said the hopeful husbands 
would probably have to pay the traditional african bride price 
under proposed changes to laws covering the powers of tribal chiefs 
in this southern arican nation 
the payment known as lobola is usually made in cattle 
cash clothing and household goods and it is recoverable if the 
woman proves to be barren 
in the past whites did not come under the jurisdiction of 
traditional chiefs courts also known as community courts where 
matrimonial issues arise 
most mixed marriages have been conducted in westernstyle 
ceremonies 
under proposed laws however you could well find a white 
person in front of a community court in any dispute over bride 
price chinamasa told legislators 
he was asking the parliament to approve proposals that restore 
some legal powers to chiefs and remove the exemption of foreigners 
from customary law 
chinamasa conceded that in cases where german and danish aid 
workers in rural zimbabwe married local women they could be liable 
for backdated payments 
the laws are expected to come into force later this year

money does make a difference education 
officials told a house subcommittee wednesday as disagreements 
erupted over public school finances that enable some districts to 
spend up to eight times more than others in the same state 
the notion that money does not make a difference is 
preposterous on its face said arthur e wise director of the 
center for the study of the teaching profession at the rand corp 
when the advantaged have the better financed schools and the 
disadvantaged the poorly financed schools america continues to 
provide unequal education to those who most need what school has to 
offer he said 
wise was one of five witnesses at an education and labor 
subcommittee hearing on a bill to require states to equalize 
education spending statewide or face the loss of federal aid 
the committee chairman rep augustus hawkins dcalif who 
introduced the bill tuesday cited statistics from a congressional 
study that found most states spend widely different sums to educate 
children living in different areas illinois new jersey new york 
texas and vermont were said to have the sharpest disparities 
k forbis jordan a professor at arizona state university said 
census bureau data show the levels of revenue disparity among the 
states ranged from 100 to 1 in hawaii to 849 to 1 in new york 
states with spending disparities below twotoone include 
alabama connecticut delaware florida maryland north carolina 
rhode island south carolina and west virginia the common element 
in these states he said is a relatively small number of school 
districts 
states with spending disparities above fourtoone were alaska 
arkansas colorado minnesota montana new york north dakota 
ohio oklahoma texas and vermont the financing systems in 
montana and texas are being challenged 
rep peter smith rvt questioned the accuracy of the 
statistics from the congressional research service saying they 
were radically wrong 
he said the data do not reflect differences among school 
districts such as population and location 
albert kauffman of the mexican american legal defense and 
educational fund in san antonio texas said that in texas where 
the state supreme court recently found the system of financing 
public school education violates the state constitution the 
richest districts pay half the taxes and spend twice as much on 
their students

by the us supreme courts ruling last year that burning the flag 
is a form of protest protected by the first amendment which 
guarantees freedom of speech 
rep tommy burnett questioned rhineharts proposal saying it 
would permit a constitutional act to now be assaultable no 
committee member was recorded as voting against the bill when it 
was sent tuesday to the house calendar committee 
the measure is a long way from becoming law it must be set for 
debate on the house floor by the calendar committee which has the

president bush on wednesday lambasted a 
proposed social security tax cut as sleight of hand but labeled as 
innovative thinking a plan that eventually would make the 
retirement system private 
bush said he was not prepared to endorse a plan sponsored by 
rep john e porter rill and the house republican whip newt 
gingrich of georgia its worthy though of consideration of 
some study he said 
people are concerned about social security so when you have 
innovative thinking of that nature i dont want to just gun it 
down bush added im not going to support it 
under the portergingrich proposal social security taxes would 
be gradually channeled into a type of mandatory individual 
retirement accounts as workers iras grew their claim on social 
security would decline by the time todays workers are retired 
about 50 years from now porter estimated social security would 
be fully privatized 
seldom since republican nominee barry goldwaters losing 1964 
presidential campaign has a national gop figure spoken publicly of 
even the remote possibility of replacing social security with 
private retirement plans the presidents refusal at a news 
conference to reject the portergingrich proposal was quickly 
criticized by sen daniel patrick moynihan the new york democrat 
whose own taxcut plan was dismissed by bush 
moynihan who is considered one of the governments top 
authorities on social security said of the republican 
congressmens proposal the president described that as 
innovative thinking was it innovative thinking after 50 years of 
steady payments to start dismantling social security i dont think 
so 
the subject of social security arose at bushs news conference 
when he was asked about moynihans plan to roll back this years 
tax increase and reduce one scheduled next year the aim of the 
bill which has attracted widespread interest if not support in 
congress is to halt the use of surplus social security taxes to 
make the federal deficit appear far smaller than it is 
bush said he sees no need for any major change in social 
security at this time i think the system has been in and out 
over the years basically a pretty fair system he said 
moynihans bill is a disguise for increased taxes around the 
corner bush said this is a sleightofhand operation 
he added noting that shortly after moynihan outlined his plan 
sen ernest f hollings dsc proposed to replace revenues from 
the reduced social security taxes with a national sales tax 
there is no sleight of hand whatsoever moynihan replied 
and i do not see that there was any need to make such a 
characterization 
lawmakers from both parties have expressed displeasure that 
social security surpluses which are building at the rate of 1 
billion a week are being used for deficit reduction rather than 
being invested solely for the benefit of future retirees 
moynihan has been speaking on this issue for months but it 
grabbed public attention for the first time when during a slow 
news period over the december holidays he called for cutting the 
taxes if they are not going to be saved for social security 
there were these other developments wednesday 
bush said congress should wait to see his own proposal for 
gradually taking social security surpluses out of the federal 
deficit calculation that longrange plan starting in 1993 would 
require that a growing portion of the surplus be used to retire 
publicly held debt 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said he has serious 
reservations about moynihans proposed tax cut which would require 
congress to find an additional 55 billion for deficit reduction 
this year he said he fears that instead of raising taxes or 
cutting spending to make up that loss congress and the president 
would opt for increased borrowing 
reps byron dorgan dnd and richard durbin dill 
proposed to roll back only this years increase in the social 
security tax rate which rose from 751 percent to 765 percent of 
the first 51300 of wages congress then could use the rest of 
this year to devise a plan for ensuring that social security taxes 
are used solely for social security

independence for the soviet republic and said the church there is 
still not free it was reported wednesday 
cardinal vincentas sladkevicius told the weekly roman catholic 
magazine il sabato that he did not want to create problems for 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev but lithuanians would not 
accept the soviet occupation of the baltic land 
we say this only let perestroika go its way and let us go 
ours the cardinal said 
the church has promoted for more than 50 years the cause of 
national independence and it will continue to do so the 
annexation of 1939 is based on a villanous pact between the soviets 
and nazis it cannot be defended in any way on the legal plane 
even moscow has recognized this we want to separate from the 
soviet union sladkevicius said according to the excerpts of the 
interview released in advance by the magazine 
the cardinal said a law on conscience being prepared by soviet 
officials was new only in name and that the church in 
lithuania is not yet free the magazine reported 
lithuania an independent country before world war ii was 
occupied by the soviet union in 1940 and has been considered a 
stronghold of nationalism an estimated 25 million people or 80 
percent of lithuanias population are roman catholics

an enterprising czechoslovak 
community on wednesday took out an ad in one of west germanys 
newspapers to offer its unwanted statue of josef v stalin to 
collectors for 50000 
the advertisement in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung from the 
local authorities in the north moravian city of zabreh said the 
largerthanlife statue of the late soviet dictator was dismantled 
dec 8 
touting the monument as a collectors item probably the last 
memorial of this symbol of violence in europe it offerd the 
statue for 50000 it said would go toward refurbishing the local 
hospital 
the new owner will not only get a unique curiosity he will 
also be supporting the struggle of the czechoslovak people for 
freedom and democracy the ad pledged 
zabreh is not alone in trying to sell its stalin monument a 
similar project has been touted in the czech town of komarov near 
prague while the city of ostrava is to dismantle its giant 
twofaced monument showing stalin and soviet founder vladimir i 
lenin 
the statues survived the destalinization campaign that saw 
thousands of similar monuments dismantled across the communist 
world because czechoslovak authorities were slow to take up the 
policy adopted in the soviet union after 1956 
a giant statue of stalin that once dominated central prague was 
dismantled only in the early 1960s

federal budget shortfalls seem stuck at the 
140 billion level in coming years making it ever harder for 
congress and the white house to meet grammrudman deficit targets 
congressional analysts said wednesday 
congressional budget office director robert d reischauer also 
projected that the us economy would sidestep a recession this 
year and he predicted that congress would be hard pressed to plug 
the huge budget gap sen daniel moynihans proposed social security 
payroll tax cut would create 
in remarks that came five days before president bush reveals his 
1991 budget reischauer said a healthy economy would not be enough 
to allay the governments persistent fiscal woes 
over the next few years no further progress in reducing the 
deficit can be expected under current budgetary policies 
reischauer told the senate budget committee 
reischauer said he expected the shortfall in fiscal 1990 which 
runs through sept 30 to be 138 billion he predicted deficits 
of 138 billion next year 135 billion in 1992 and 141 billion 
in 1993 the year the grammrudman deficitreduction law requires a 
balanced budget 
the economic and budgetary projections issued by the 
nonpartisan cbo were decidedly more pessimistic than estimates 
expected monday when the white houses office of management and 
budget releases bushs budget 
omb is expected to assert that only about 35 billion in savings 
will be needed next year to meet the grammrudman shortfall target 
of 64 billion 37 billion less than the savings the congressional 
budget office says are needed 
cbos estimates have little legal significance in 
budgetwriting but they are relied on by many lawmakers 
especially democrats as a voice of truth in the often partisan 
fiscal process 
the office of management and budget consistently understates 
the deficits by resorting to the most optimistic economic 
assumptions it can credibly and now sometimes even incredibly 
employ said senate budget committee chairman james sasser 
dtenn 
the cbo forecast that the economy would expand by a low 18 
percent this year measured from the final quarter of last year 
through the third quarter of 1990 well below the 26 percent the 
administration is expected to predict the stronger the economy 
the greater the revenues the government collects and the lower the 
budget deficit 
fiftyone private economists surveyed by blue chip economic 
indicators a private publication have projected that the economy 
will expand by an average of 17 percent this year 
reischauer said he believes that a looser monetary policy the 
federal reserve has practiced since last june will help drive 
interest rates down and thus avoid a recession most private 
economists agree that a slowdown this year is unlikely 
cbo expects that the federal reserve will safely steer the 
economy between the shoals of a recession and higher inflation 
he said 
reischauer was pressed by the committees ranking republican 
sen pete domenici of new mexico on the wisdom of a bill 
introduced by moynihan dny that would reduce the social 
security tax moynihans cut would reduce government revenue 
collections by 7 billion this year and 55 billion in 1991 
reischauer referred to past failings of congress and the white 
house to find large amounts of budget savings and said its hard 
to argue i think that wed be out there raising income taxes or 
other taxes or decreasing spending in large amounts 
moynihan and others have argued that the growing annual 
surpluses in the social security are masking the true size of the 
federal deficit without this years 66 billion social security 
surplus the 1990 deficit would be 204 billion reischauer said

hundreds of protesters broke through 
lines of police and soldiers wednesday and surged toward government 
headquarters demanding the leadership resign and accusing it of 
being a front for communist rule 
the crowd of about 1000 people at victory square pushed through 
two lines of unarmed police and then through a line of armed 
soldiers who took no strong action to hold them back 
the army moved in tanks very slowly and the crowd retreated 
still chanting communists in disguise and elections without 
the front a reference to the national salvation fronts plans 
to participate in elections may 20 
the front which has been governing romania since dictator 
nicolae ceausescu was ousted dec 22 had said it would not run 
candidates in the election on tuesday however it reversed itself 
opponents have accused some front members who served under 
ceausescu of being sympathetic to the communists and they fear the 
front will put the communist party in power again hours before the 
rally the largest opposition party the national peasant party 
called on the front to resign 
the national salvation front must resign today as it cant be 
both a referee and a player the party said in a communique read 
by party leader corneliu coposu 
some peasant party members left their headquarters after the 
communique was read and joined a small demonstration under way at a 
nearby university 
the demonstration picked up supporters as marchers wound through 
bucharests icy streets stopping at the major sites of the 
revolution and finally coming to victory square 
the protesters singled out president ion iliescu who heads the 
front shouting down with iliescu 
if iliescu wanted to gain power he should have gotten 
signatures on petitions and formed a party said one protester 
engineer adrian mihalcea 
the peasant party accused the front of trying to steal victory 
from the young people and others who fought communism and ceausescu 
they are making us believe that they want to put the 
communists in power again even worse ceausescuism only the words 
are different but the methods of the salvation front are the 
same as ceausescus methods party vice president ion puiu said 
in an interview 
puiu said the communique would be circulated to all the 
traditional parties the national liberal party the social 
democratic party and the green party for comments and additions 
to demonstrate anticommunist solidarity 
the peasant party said it planned a major demonstration against 
the front on sunday 
the national peasant party founded in 1892 was one of the 
major forces in romanian politics before the communists came to 
power after world war ii it is the largest and best organized of 
the 15 new or revived political parties that plan to contest the 
election 
iliescu a former communist party member who ran afoul of 
ceausescu and was demoted from party secretary told a rally jan 
12 that the communist party is dead and he outlawed it 
the following day iliescu reversed himself saying the ban had 
been a hasty decision and that voters would decide the partys fate 
in a jan 28 referendum the referendum was canceled because of 
time constraints and because officials said the questions on it 
were moot 
the decision to compete in may even alienated some front members 
the daily romania libera said wednesday that a former leading 
dissident doina cornea resigned from the interim leading body 
saying she did not want to take part in a power struggle 
puiu said the peasant party wants the front to resign 
immediately and that the new government should be formed either by 
technical experts who can guarantee the administration of the 
country and conduct fair elections or by all political parties 
committed to the same goals 
the front meanwhile said it planned to meet with all parties 
saturday to discuss campaign funding and the proposed election law 
it said un observers will monitor the vote 
puiu said he supports a boycott of the meeting to protest the 
fronts decision 
adrian jeara a peasant party member said his party has 150000 
members 
the biggest problem of our party is that we havent got the 
opportunity to appear on radio or television and we dont have our 
own journals he said 
when party members asked the government for paper to print a new 
journal he said the government told them there wasnt enough 
paper so they couldnt have any 
however premier petre roman told the daily adevarul recently 
there was no shortage of newsprint and that all parties which want 
to publish their own newspaper will get it

us and soviet negotiators seeking to speed 
work on a proposed arms pact have agreed to the first ever peek at 
each others nuclear warheads us spokesmen said wednesday 
under the terms of a little publicized protocol signed in geneva 
on monday us and soviet inspectors will take a close look 
sometime this spring at warheads atop one each of the other sides 
landbased and submarinelaunched ballistic missiles the spokesmen 
said 
determining the exact number of warheads aboard missiles and 
bombers will be key when the two sides complete work on the 
strategic arms reduction treaty to cut superpower arsenals by 30 
percent to 50 percent 
secretary of state james a baker iii is to hold talks in moscow 
on feb 67 with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in 
an effort to speed work on the start accord for possible signing at 
an expected summit next june 
three previous arms control treaties have not been ratified by 
the senate in large measure because of doubts that they could be 
verified 
under the new protocol the soviets also will have a chance to 
look at two us b1b bombers and the americans at two soviet 
tupolev95 bear bombers one version will be designed to carry 
cruise missiles and the other to carry standard bombs 
the soviet ballistic missiles to be inspected are the landbased 
ss18 and the the submarinelaunched ssn23 said matthew murphy 
a spokesman for the us arms control and disarmament agency 
the soviets say the ss18 like the us mx missile carries 10 
warheads although one intelligence source said that the big soviet 
booster can lift up to 20 nuclear devices the soviets will get a 
close look under the tip of an mx and the new d5 to be deployed 
aboard submarines starting this march 
the d5 is designed to carry eight and the ssn23 to carry four 
warheads according to information published by the two sides 
this agreement marks the first time that the us and the 
soviet union will inspect a number of each others nuclear warheads 
on ballistic missiles said a statement read by david denny a 
state department spokesman 
the exact time and place of the inspections has not been 
disclosed 
president bush last june proposed that the two sides test 
verification techniques before conclusion of start an unusual step 
designed to enhance ability to monitor the compliance of the other 
side 
at the 1987 washington summit the sides agreed on the number of 
warheads to be attributed to each existing type of stategic 
ballistic missile and on the need for inspections 
precautions will be taken to ensure that the inspectors learn as 
little as possible about the internal design of the warheads 
possible by shrouding them in cloths so that opposing experts see 
only several lumps inside the delivery vehicles said one source 
its the dance of the seven veils said the source 
in a separate development the state department said us 
officials still hope to sign at the june summit an agreement on two 
unratified nuclear test treaties from the 1970s 
however the administration is balking at planned followon 
talks designed to lead to lower ceilings and numbers of underground 
nuclear tests said sources who spoke on condition they not be 
further identified 
the decision was reported earlier by the washington times and 
the washington post 
the state department statement said that in this round of the 
current talks we are continuing to focus on the completion of 
protocols to provide for effective verification of the threshhold 
test ban treaty of 1974 and the peaceful nuclear explosions treaty 
of 1976 
the treaties were never submitted to the senate but in 1986 
president reagan told congress he would do so after reaching 
agreement with the soviets on a means to verify that neither side 
was exceeding the 150kiloton ceiling set by the pacts

president bush on wednesday denied a report 
that his family members were split on abortion calling the account 
pure unadulterated malarkey 
on the volatile issue that continues to bedevil him and the 
republican party bush also said he sees no problem in campaigning 
for gop candidates who are prochoice even though he opposes 
abortion except for rape incest or a threat to a mothers life 
newsweek magazine this week said abortion was discussed at a 
private meeting of the bushes with their children and spouses and 
the men all opposed abortion while the women all took a prochoice 
stance 
bush was asked at a news conference if barbara bush supports 
abortion rights 
no i couldnt confirm that and the meeting that i read 
about in one of the most respected publications was pure 
unadulterated malarkey is the word i like to use it just 
wasnt there bush replied 
mrs bush when asked about abortion refused to state a 
position saying that no matter how she answers it will offend 
someone 
since the supreme court last year gave states greater authority 
to regulate abortions prochoice activism has escalated and many 
republican officeholders have embraced that policy 
bush and the republican party have shifted from the hardline 
antiabortion rhetoric to a policy of inclusion stating the 
republican party has room for prochoice advocates as well 
bush reiterated that point of view on wednesday when asked about 
his support for prochoice party members 
i was elected to try to fulfill the platform and the programs 
that i believe in and so thats my personal choice but that 
doesnt mean i have lack of respect for others and that im going 
to go out and not campaign for people that disagree with me on this 
issue 
bush once supported the supreme court 1973 decision that 
legalized abortion but now opposes it he opposes abortion except 
to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest he 
favors federal payment for abortions only to save the mothers life 
bush addressed the annual march for life on monday by telephone 
from the oval office telling the antiabortion activists before 
they marched to the supreme court of my deep personal concern 
about abortion on demand 
let me assure you that this president stands with you on this 
issue of life said bush who supports a constitutional human 
life amendment to outlaw most abortions

sen bill bradley announced wednesday the 
formation of an advisory council to push for ratification of a un 
convention on rights for children and highlight problems plaguing 
youth worldwide 
the convention stresses the importance of primary health care 
and education and it recommends measures to protect against child 
labor sexual exploitation and drug abuse it also sets up steps to 
protect children in cases of adoption foster care and juvenile 
justice proceedings 
bradley dnj said americans must make a commitment to 
protect the rights of all children 
if american children have the right to be free from polio and 
whooping cough and dysentery so do the children of ethiopia and 
pakistan if american children have the right to be free from 
famine so do the children of the sudan bradley said at a news 
conference 
twenty countries must ratify the convention for it to have the 
force of an international treaty the un general assembly 
approved the document in november 
a report issued in december by the un childrens fund said 
spending by third world countries on armaments and debt service 
rather than health and nutrition could doom 100 million children to 
death by disease and starvation in the 1990s 
the annual report by james grant unicef executive director 
said that almost 8000 children die each day because they are not 
immunized nearly 7000 die daily from dehydration caused by 
diarrhea and about 6000 are killed each day by pneumonia the 
report says 
the cost of immunizing all these children and providing 
medicines for dehydration and pneumonia would be about 25 billion 
a year the report says 
bradley said the advisory council will include a crosssection 
of people from throughout the united states 
on tuesday bradley and sen richard lugar rind introduced a 
resolution in the senate urging president bush to send the 
convention to the senate for deliberation as soon as possible

president bush made fewer nominations to the 
federal bench in his first year than either of his two immediate 
predecessors leaving 52 of 75 vacancies on district and circuit 
courts with no nominee the democratic study group said wednesday 
in a study of presidential appointments to executive and 
judicial positions the group also said that 28 percent of the 390 
presidentially appointed positions in agencies and departments that 
require senate confirmation remained unfilled as of jan 1 
at the end of former president reagans first year in office 82 
percent of presidentially appointed positions in the agencies and 
departments were filled according to a recent library of congress 
survey 
the dsg an organization of democratic members of the house 
said bush had 75 vacancies to fill in federal courts during his 
first year in office of these only l5 five on the appeals courts 
and 10 on district courts were nominated and confirmed in 1989 
separately the white house announced bushs appointment of two 
federal appeals judges and eight us district court judges on 
wednesday 
chase untermeyer director of the white house office of 
presidential personnel and david runkel spokesman for the justice 
department were telephoned for comment on the dsg study but were 
not immediately available 
citing figures from the administrative office of the us 
courts the dsg said 18 vacancies remained on appeals courts and 42 
in the district courts in which federal civil and criminal trials 
are conducted 
confirmation of some nominees has been held up by sen jim 
jeffords rvt in a dispute with the administration over the role 
to be played by republican senators in the selection of judicial 
nominees 
but the dispute between senate republicans and the white house 
cannot explain the slowness of the bush administration this past 
year in filling judicial vacancies the dsg said 
it said the 15 confirmed nominees in the first year of the bush 
administration compared with 40 in reagans first year and 30 in 
1977 former president carters first year in office

a former pentagon official who helped guide 
and justify the defense buildup of the 1980s said wednesday he now 
favors scrapping the mx and midgetman missiles but pressing ahead 
with star wars research and the stealth bomber 
richard perle a former assistant secretary of defense who was 
among the most adamant backers of the reagan administration defense 
increases said the liberalization of the soviet union and eastern 
europe also means the united states should consider proposing 
deeper weapons cuts in arms control negotiations 
the soviet empire in collapsing perle told the senate armed 
services committee time is on our side said perle a resident 
fellow at the american enterprise institute a think tank on the 
conservative side of the political spectrum 
in response to the lessening threat of the warsaw pact perle 
suggested possibly reducing ground forces and skipping the next 
generation of weapons systems 
i would not proceed with either the midgetman or the rail 
mobile mx the current generation of icbms intercontinental 
ballistic missiles should prove adequate and the next generation 
will benefit from further research and development if it is 
delayed for a few years he said 
the mx is a 10warhead missile already deployed the midgetman 
is a smaller singlewarhead missile being developed 
the administration has recommended putting the 50 mx missiles 
now based in underground silos on rail cars the trains would move 
about during an international crisis and present a hardertohit 
target than silos the midgetman would be placed on special 
offroad trucks for the same reason 
sen john warner rva the panels ranking republican told 
perle he objected to slashing both missile systems because that 
action would remove leverage in arms control talks 
but perle responded that the importance of these agreements 
has declined dramatically 
the pentagon should also think about making do with many of 
the current generation of conventional weapons including fighter 
jets perle said 
but he said he would proceed with the b2 bomber known as the 
stealth bomber for its radarevading design at 530 million a 
copy the aircraft has been attacked by many members of congress as 
too expensive at least if the air force buys all 132 it wants 
while the changing soviet empire is good news for the west 
perle said it would be foolish for the united states to dismantle 
its defenses precipitiously 
we would be wise to wait a little longer before confidently 
predicting that we can afford to be weak in the face of 
uncertainty he said 
the soviet union spend as much as 20 percent of its gross 
national product on defense compared with 6 percent by the united 
states he said 
as for the strategic defense initiative known as star wars 
perle said the concept of a shield to protect the nation from all 
enemy missiles is unrealistic 
at the same time he said a serious program of research and 
development oriented towards a partial shield can and should go 
forward even in the face of shrinking defense budgets 
as the prospect of nuclear proliferation draws closer we 
should be reminded that the threat is neither exclusively soviet 
nor for that matter exclusively deliberate there are third 
countries and there are accidents and these two reasons alone would 
justify a vigorous research and development program perle said 
sen sam nunn dga the panels chairman said the committee 
wants defense planners at the pentagon to present a new fiveyear 
strategic plan before lawmakers make specific budgetcutting 
recommendations

some farm and consumer advocates want the food 
and drug administration to halt the distribution of milk from test 
cows treated with a synthetic hormone until the agency completes a 
scientific review 
the group said wednesday that if there is not an immediate 
suspension the fda should at least require labels on milk and 
other dairy products that originate from test cows treated with 
bovine growth hormone or bgh 
brian ahlberg of the national farm coalition said a similar 
request for halting the distribution of milk from test herds was 
made to the fda last august but the agency had not responded 
the genetically engineered hormone is bovine somatotropin and is 
usually called bst by the agriculture department and the chemical 
companies that make it doses of the hormone which also occurs 
naturally in a cows body boost milk production 
jeremy rifkin of the foundation for economic trends a longtime 
critic of the synthetic growth hormone told a news conference his 
organization is preparing a petition asking the fda for a full 
thorough internal investigation into allegations that the agency 
has worked with the drug companies and has been hiding test results 
from the public 
rifkin said the hormone has no redeeming social value and is 
bad for farmers cows taxpayers and perhaps consumer health 
during questioning however coalition spokesman ahlberg said 
the group was not claiming adverse health effects from milk 
produced by hormonetreated cows 
rifkin also accused fda of promoting the growth hormone before 
the agency has given it final clearance 
this is outrageous rifkin said this is activity that 
should have been condemned a long time ago 
rifkin said that if fda approves commercial use of the drug his 
group will seek court action to ban it 
the fda did not return calls for comment on rifkins allegation 
that the agency has been actively promoting the drug prior to its 
final approval 
speakers at the news conference said they had no information 
from the fda about the extent of testing or how much milk is 
entering the us consumer pipeline although rifkin and other have 
said they thought the percentage is quite small 
they said producers include herds maintained by landgrant 
universities and private farmers the common practice is to sell 
milk from test herds to local dealers who then mix it with other 
milk for distribution 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee has asked the general accounting office to investigate 
allegations by dr richard burroughs a fired fda veterinarian 
that tests of the chemical were inadequate 
burroughs has accused the fda of toning down criticism of 
research on the hormone at the request of chemical companies 
the fda has said the hormonetreated milk is safe to drink 
the hormone is manufactured by monsanto eli lilly upjohn and 
american cyanamid who have said the fda review has been the most 
thorough of any study of animal drugs and the fda says it has not 
made any exceptions in its drugtesting standards

the interior department reached agreement with 
environmental groups wednesday on a new plan to strictly enforce 
the nations strip mining laws 
hailed as an unqualified victory for the environment by 
lawyers for conservation associations the agreement is intended to 
make it easier to revoke coal mining permits issued to companies or 
individuals with records of past violations and to block the 
issuing of new permits in such cases 
at the heart of the new enforcement system is the planned 
installation by july 1 of a new computer system with accurate and 
complete information on coal companies and their owners 
the aim is to match permit holders and applicants with past 
violators of the 1977 strip mining law 
the product of more than four months of intense negotiations 
the agreement settles a legal and environmental dispute that began 
nearly a decade ago during james watts controversial tenure as 
secretary of the interior 
manuel lujan the present secretary signed the new agreement in 
exchange for the dropping of legal action against the department by 
save our cumberland mountains an environmental group based in the 
coalmining regions of appalachia 
lujan said the agreement signals a new willingness by the 
federal government to coooperate with environmentalists 
our aim is fair evenhanded enforcement of the surface mining 
law lujan said in a statement 
brent rushforth an attorney who represented the environmental 
group said the agreement should put an end to years of neglect 
by the department of the interior neglect which permitted mine 
operators to routinely violate the law scar the land and pollute 
the water 
but rushforth said the department has made other agreements over 
the years to enforce the strip mining law and has not complied with 
them 
it is now up to the department to live up to the promises 
rushforth said you can be sure well watch them closely 
rushforth said that to comply with the agreement the 
departments office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement 
will most likely use a computer system developed by save our 
cumberland mountains and the national wildlife federation 
the plan for the department spelled out in the agreement has 
these major components 
coalmining permit applications will be run through the 
computer system with approval given only to those applicants with 
no ties to violators 
a computer review of existing mining permits will be initiated 
and enforcement action taken if a permit was improperly issued 
development by march 1 1990 of a plan to enforce federal 
mining cessation orders 
development of sanctions against people who intentionally give 
incomplete or false ownership information on coalmine permit 
applications 
the surface mining control and reclamation act of 1977 was 
intended to ensure that land stripmined for coal would be restored 
save our cumberland mountains originally sued the department in 
1981 contending the surface mining act was not being enforced 
an initial settlement was reached the next year but rushforth 
said little or nothing was done to implement it 
the environmental group complained that in appalachia in 
particular shell companies have been used to evade the 
requirements of the act with an operator mining a site then 
abandoning it unreclaimed 
enforcement efforts against the shell which usually has no 
assets or is bankrupt prove futile the group said meanwhile 
the operator creates another shell company and repeats the rape 
and run process 
in 1985 a court order was obtained requiring the department to 
establish a computer system to contain data on the identity of 
owners of mining permits and to match them with violators of the 
act 
but rushforth said a series of congressional investigations 
showed the system was ineffective and accomplished none of its 
objectives 
harry snyder director of the surface mining office said he 
inherited a broken computer system that the government had spent 
millions of dollars on and which didnt work 
now he said youve got a new administration committed to 
enforce this law fairly and in a committed way

the state department criticized on wednesday 
as outrageous and indefensible the haitian governments 
expulsion of democratic opposition leaders and other measures to 
silence dissent 
in a followup to the weekend expulsion of four prominent 
politicians haitian authorities arrested a leading business figure 
tuesday and ordered broadcast outlets to air only 
governmentapproved news 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler called the 
measures a blatant assault on civil liberties that puts at risk 
the democratic transition the government has promised 
we call upon the government of haiti to cease any actions 
which infringe on freedom of speech and other basic human rights 
and to rescind its emergency measures 
under questioning ms tutwiler raised the possibility that a 
414 million program of us humanitarian aid funneled through 
private groups might be curtailed 
later however other state department officials denied that the 
option was being considered noting that the funds benefit the 
haitian people directly and are not handled by haitian authorities 
the only governmenttogovernment aid provided to haiti since 
november 1987 was 10 million in food assistance last year 
the actions of the haitian government have been outrageous and 
indefensible ms tutwiler said they will affect ushaitian 
relations and the prospect for future aid you cannot destroy 
democracy in order to save it 
elections are scheduled for october but ms tutwiler said they 
will lack credibility if opposition leaders are not allowed full 
participation 
a haitian information ministry statement told broadcasters that 
it must approve their local news reports and ordered them to 
refrain from relaying or broadcasting any information on haiti 
from stations broadcasting from abroad 
in recent days stations have relayed statements by exiled 
opposition leaders broadcast by radio france internationale and the 
voice of america 
stations also were told not to broadcast anything likely to 
incite agitation

a tree planted at the university of 
virginia the year school founder thomas jefferson died has been 
given a reprieve from becoming a woodpile but not for long 
the majestic but moribund mcguffey ash planted in 1826 was to 
have been taken down during the christmas holiday break but will 
continue to stand in a garden until late next month 
then its trunk and limbs weakened by decay and lightning will 
be cut up and stacked under a protective cover while a subcommittee 
of the universitys faculty arboretum and landscape committee 
decides what to do with the wood 
j james murray jr the committee chairman said he hopes at 
least one piece of ceremonial furniture for the university a 
table a lectern or a chest is made from the trees remains 
the delay occurred because bidding for the job of removing the 
164yearold tree was redone to include preserving the wood for 
some time said jeffrey s ertle the universitys assistant vice 
president for landscape 
i suspect that while we may use some of it right away a lot 
of that wood is going to sit around for a while so were going to 
have to do a good job of preserving it ertle said 
albemarle tree co won the contract with a bid of 6480 
the tree which will be replaced with one of its offspring was 
named for the rev william h mcguffey who lived near where the 
tree was planted but is better known as the developer of the 
mcguffey readers once widely used in public schools

a hispanic police officer convicted of manslaughter 
in the deaths of two black men was sentenced today to seven years 
in state prison in a case that triggered three nights of racial 
violence 
william lozano 31 who remained sternfaced throughout his 
daylong sentencing hearing listened impassively as dade circuit 
judge joseph farina imposed the sentence 
we all value the sanctity of human life we all value our 
police officers and the crucial and difficult role that they play 
in our community the judge said the incident in this case has 
been deepl felt by the court and by the jury 
the defense which promised an appeal beforehand used the 
hearing to outline its objections including the judges refusal to 
exclude a black union official from the jury his refusal to move 
the trial from miami and his rejection of testimony during the 
sentencing hearing 
the judge agreed to let lozano remain free on 10000 bond and 
ordered his attorneys to file an appeal within 30 days 
lozano was fingerprinted in court standard procedure after 
sentencing he and his attorneys refused to comment as they left 
court moments later 
outside the courtroom lead prosecutor john hogan said it was 
obviously a very difficult decision i think its a fair sentence 
i think under the circumstances i dont think anyone should 
complain its a substantial prison sentence 
lozano fatally shot an unarmed motorcyclist and his passenger 
died in the resulting crash deaths that led to three days of 
rioting in miamis black neighborhoods a year ago 
at the sentencing hearing a defense lawyer unsuccessfully asked 
for a new trial with the argument that the officer was prosecuted 
to prevent racial violence rather than to achieve justice and 
deserves a new trial 
we dont have trials in order to satisfy mobs attorney roy 
black said pointing to the ring of steel the armored security 
teams that surrounded the courthouse just before the verdict dec 7 
assistant state attorney richard shiffrin said those arguments 
had already been rejected at trial and that the extraordinary 
security was needed to ensure justice not prevent it 
after attorney arguments adina lloyd mother of slain 
motorcyclist clement lloyd took the stand to ask for justice for 
her son she looked at lozano and said bitterly if it was my son 
that did it to him my son would be behind bars now 
representatives of police organizations and lozanos family 
argued for leniency lozanos mother haydee lozano said he had a 
hard childhood but has been the one who helped us through the 
difficult battles 
prosecutors maintained that under state guidelines the 
suspended officer faced a 12 to 17year prison term the defense 
had argued a different interpretation of three to seven years but 
the judge sided with the prosecution 
dade countys community relations board has stressed to blacks 
that it was unlikely lozano would get the maximum sentence because 
of his background and because he is a firsttime offender 
they have to be a little realistic said crisis coordinator 
willie sims 
not even solomon could decide this one to satisfy everyone 
said d marvin jones an associate professor of law at the 
university of miami 
a light sentence would send the message that black life comes 
at a discount said jones who is black the sentencing is very 
symbolic this case is a metaphor for racial problems in miami 
lozano shot and killed lloyd 23 as he fled from a squad car 
pursuing him for running a stop sign lloyds passenger 
24yearold allan blanchard died of injuries suffered when the 
motorcycle crashed 
the jan 16 1989 deaths led to racial unrest here for the 
fourth time in the 1980s all linked to the killings of blacks by 
white officers in two of those cases acquittals of the policemen 
had sparked racial violence and police braced for renewed rioting 
as lozanos trial neared an end last month 
but on dec 7 a racially mixed jury convicted lozano and the 
black neighborhood of overtown celebrated in the street where lloyd 
and blanchard died 
police did not anticipate any trouble after lozanos sentencing 
nor were any plans made to mobilize the entire force today 
were not doing anything differently said police spokesman 
angelo bitsis its going to be a normal operation 
many blacks have called for colombianborn lozano to receive the 
stiffest penalty possible 
i dont know if he should get life said clemon gardner who 
lives in the predominantly black liberty city section but i 
think he should pay for the crime 
but there also has been a groundswell of support for lozano 
especially from the hispanic community and fellow officers some of 
whom wore black wristbands in solidarity with the policeman 
carlos lopez station manager for colombianoriented wocnam 
said thousands of letters had been received urging the judge not to 
send lozano to prison the station also collected 40000 for 
lozanos defense lopez said

religious beliefs among hmong tribesmen 
from the mountains of laos have led to the exhumation of a teacher 
to lift a curse by removing from her casket photographs of her 
hmong pupils 
buying a beloved picture is an honor to a lot of people but 
a disgrace and dishonor to the hmong said angela mann 
director of the local headstart program 
many hmong refugees from southeast asia have animist religious 
beliefs that involve spirits which control good and evil in the 
world 
if you are still alive but your picture or hair or some other 
thing from the body is buried it causes your spirit to leave your 
body you are more likely to get sick said ying vang executive 
director of the hmong social agency 
the grave of headstart teacher charlotte bell 61 was opened 
tuesday at the urging of several hmong parents 
bell had been hospitalized in december for pneumonia she 
received a getwell card made by a colleague that included photos 
of her 36 students more than 20 of them hmong mann said 
bell died after a stroke jan 1 and her family tucked the card 
in her casket before burial 
hmong parents learned the pictures had been buried and demanded 
them back burying the pictures separated the children from their 
spirits exposing them to bad luck illness and early death they 
said 
the parents felt their children were cursed they would have 
bad luck for the rest of their lives i didnt want that on my 
head mann said 
sixteen children were kept home by their parents until they were 
reunited with their spirits mann said 
the 700 for the exhumation was raised from private sources 
mann said she said she tracked down bells son in mexico for 
permission to exhume the body 
her son readily agreed her sister and brother werent too 
happy about it but they didnt do anything about it mann said 
two officials from lao family community a hmong social agency 
were there when the pictures were removed and performed a 
spiritcalling ceremony to lure the spirits out of the grave along 
with the photos 
the process of calling back the childrens spirits requires two 
more steps one requiring the photos 
but mann said headstart cant release the photos without written 
permission from each parent and the children wont return to school 
until the ceremonies are complete 
a meeting with lao family community will be held to resolve the 
problem she said

a nurse convicted of killing four 
patients by injecting them with a paralyzing drug so he could 
revive them and appear a hero was sentenced wednesday to 50 years 
to life in prison 
you had no right to usurp gods function judge alfred tisch 
told richard angelo in imposing the maximum sentence allowed by 
state law 
tisch said angelo who was emotionless as sentencing was 
pronounced had violated in the cruelest most inhumane manner 
the childlike trust a hospital patient places in a nurse 
the patients most of them sick and elderly had a right to 
enjoy in their own way every day that was available to them he 
said 
angelo 27 of lindenhurst was convicted dec 15 of two counts 
of murder one of manslaughter and one of criminally negligent 
homicide in the 1987 deaths at good samaritan hospital 
angelo told authorities he injected the patients with pavulon a 
paralyzing drug so that when they stopped breathing and he was the 
first on the scene he could revive them and be a hero 
prosecutor john collins said angelo administered the fatal 
injections out of inadequacy and because of his deeprooted 
contempt for authority 
collins asked the court to treat angelo with the same compassion 
that he showed his victims and urged the maximum sentence 
these were no folks who took an illadvised stroll in central 
park after dark he said these were sick vulnerable people 
who had entrusted their care to this defendant 
angelos attorney eric naiburg said he would file a notice of 
appeal he said he had expected the maximum sentence 
angelo was handcuffed and led to the county jail where he has 
been held since his arrest in november 1987 a month after the 
killings 
he also was convicted of assault in connection with the deaths 
of four patients and the neardeath of another he was acquitted of 
assaulting two patients 
collins said authorities suspect angelo was responsible for the 
deaths of several other patients as he also used the drug 
anectine whose detection in skin tissue disappears 24 hours after 
use 
outside the courthouse family members of some of the victims 
said they wished that angelo could have received the death penalty 
that was the opinion of kieran greene whose 57yearold father 
anthony died from a pavulon injection we have to put this behind 
us and move forward but well never forget he said

health care workers are paying little heed 
voluntary guidelines for preventing the spread of aids and 
hepatitis b a microbiologist told a house panel thursday 
describing his eyewitness surveys of practices at laboratories 
and hospitals joseph h coggin jr told a house education and 
labor subcommittee that 
a phlebotomist in the mobile ala hospital where he works 
took 10 or 12 blood samples without changing gloves potentially 
exposing patients though not herself then walked out and went down 
the elevator without removing the gloves 
you go in a hospital and watch he said how many people 
wearing gloves are pushing the elevator button or using the phone 
a worker in a california laboratory who scooped up spilled 
blood and broken glass in his bare hand after six test tubes broke 
the worker then discovered there was no biohazard disposal bag so 
he opened the door with his hand and walked out carrying the blood 
none of the 10000 to 12000 tubes of blood samples had a top 
and a highpowered cooler blew across the tops of the tubes into 
the faces of workers one in 30 samples in this laboratory 
contained the hiv virus the cause of aids 
this is a typical way that spills are managed in your blood 
labs across the united states including hospital labs said 
coggin a department chairman and associate dean at the university 
of south alabama college of medicine in mobile just walk in and 
watch 
out of ignorance and fear workers are not reporting the many 
instances in which they are stuck by used needles or nicked by 
instruments many employers are not offering to vaccinate workers 
against hepatitis b 
the subcommittee on safety and health is reviewing proposed 
regulations by the occupational safety and health administration to 
require basic safety precautions equipment and training for the 
nations estimated 6 million health care workers as well as 
hepatitis b vaccinations for anyone who could be exposed to the 
virus that causes it 
a set of voluntary universal precautions has been in effect 
since 1987 but coggin said those are not being applied 
the problem of aids exposure was highlighted this week in a 
brooklyn ny courtroom where dr veronica prego is suing the 
kings county hospital for 175 million she says she caught aids 
after jabbing her finger in 1983 with a contaminated needle 
last week the centers for disease control acknowledged that the 
number of health care workers infected with the hiv virus on the 
job is higher than official figures 
the cdc has reported 27 such cases worldwide 19 in the united 
states the agency is investigating 34 other cases said david 
bell chief of aids activity in the hospital infections program at 
the cdc

japans first lunar probe was put into 
orbit around the earth on wednesday ending a 14year gap between 
moon missions and giving new prestige to the countrys young space 
program 
space center officials said the musesa satellite as planned 
separated from its nissanmade rocket several minutes after liftoff 
wednesday night from an oceanside launch site in southern japan 
mission chief hiroki matsuo said data from tracking stations in 
california and australia showed the satellite was orbiting the 
earth at a maximum distance of 186000 miles 
the satellite in its highly elliptical orbit is to close within 
11250 miles of the moon by march 18 
at that time shortly before it crosses the moons path in a 
socalled swingby it is to release a second smaller 
satellite which will be propelled into lunar orbit about 10000 
miles from the moon 
the smaller satellite will send data its mother satellite 
detailing the lunar regions temperatures and electrical fields 
the launch orginally was scheduled tuesday but the countdown 
was stopped with 18 seconds remaining because of an electrical 
problem in the hydraulic system 
only the united states and the soviet union have sent missions 
to the moon the most recent being the 1976 landing of an unmanned 
soviet vehicle 
the mission is a symbolic step forward for japans growing space 
program which has relied more on diligent engineering than large 
budgets 
this time we are going to the moon but our objective is not 
the moon itself matsuo said our institute is getting into 
interplanetary missions in the 1990s and for that we need to 
refine our technology 
as technicians prepared the m3s2 rocket on the space centers 
only launch pad officials shivered in buildings around the center 
where heaters were turned off to conserve electricity for the 
launch equipment 
around the site volunteers from neighboring villages stood 
watch in the firefighters traditional redandblack uniforms 
both the institute of space and astronautical science isas 
which is conducting the moon mission and japans other space 
agency the national space development agency have plans for 
future manned space flights and interplanetary travel 
nasda which focuses on applied uses of space also is 
developing a small space shuttle and a new alljapanese rocket the 
h2 that will handle a payload comparable to those carried by 
us soviet and european rockets isas focuses on scientific 
research in space 
the mission was sponsored by the governmentfunded institute of 
space and astronautical science will give japan valuable 
experience in targeting orbits and in the use of swingbys to 
guide future spacecraft traveling to distant planets 
the nissan rocket used in the launch carried a payload of only 
400 pounds the h1 rocket is expected to handle two tons 
japans first satellite was launched in 1970 musesa is the 
13th japanese satellite in operation 
in recent years japan has achieved a respected aerospace launch 
record despite its late entry into the field low budgets 106 
billion last year and a shortage of good launch sites 
japans two main launch areas in uchinoura and in nearby 
tanagashima are only a tiny fraction of the size of space centers 
in other nations

the senate judiciary committee chairman on 
wednesday accused the bush administration of waging its drug war on 
the wrong front focusing on the shrinking number of casual users 
instead of hardcore addicts 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel told a news briefing that 
placing emphasis on casual uses represented a misapplication of 
those resources and those dollars 
biden unveiled a rival strategy for fighting the war on drugs 
as for the casual user we probably three years ago reached 
the apex in terms of numbers biden said in making public a 
strategy that would cost an estimated 146 billion in the fiscal 
year that starts oct 1 well above the bush administrations 
expected recommendation 
the plan also envisions providing drug treatment for all 
pregnant addicts within one year and full treatment on demand 
within four years 
biden tapped to provide the democratic response when president 
bush addressed the nation on drugs last fall said this report did 
not represent the views of either the judiciary committee or any 
democratic party group 
he released his blueprint as the national drug policy director 
william bennett prepared to present the second installment of the 
administrations plan for contending with the drug scourge 
biden acknowledged that the administration already is doing many 
of the things recommended in his rival strategy but said its 
emphasis has been different and the focus has been too much on 
casual drug abusers thats allowing them to do nothing about the 
hardcore user he said 
the moral approbation of mainstream america has more impact on 
the casual user than anything we do he said he said the chief 
focus should be hardcore addicts because they have caused the 
increase in crime drugrelated medical emergencies crack babies 
and drugrelated child abuse 
under our plan the hard core user must either go into 
treatment or go to jail and when they go to jail go into treatment 
in jail biden said 
biden also said the administrations socalled andean plan 
focuses primarily on military aid while his approach envisions 
offering producer nations in south america relief of their 
international debt in return for planting substitute crops in place 
of coca 
bidens outline calls for doubling to 1000 the number of fbi 
agents investigating drug rings as well as increasing the number of 
drug enforcement agents and prosecutors working on narcotics cases 
it estimates expenditures on its expanded treatment provisions 
at more than 38 billion in the next fiscal year 
under bidens plan the government also would build 10 regional 
prisons and 12 boot camps on closed military bases to incarcerate 
federal state and local offenders at a price tag of 850 million 
a number of assaultstyle semiautomatic weapons would be banned 
under the measure but most would remain legal 
and the plan would make 300 million available for drug 
emergency areas in contrast to the administration plan which 
calls for 40 million 
in all honesty 300 million is not going to make a 
fundamental change biden acknowledged

hundreds of kashmir policemen went on 
strike for five hours wednesday to support moslem separatistss 
demands that army troops called in to quell violence leave 
jammukashmir state 
gov jagmohan who uses only one name appealed to the 
separatists to lay down their arms on the fourth day of a crackdown 
on the violent propakistani secessionist movement in kashmir 
at least 57 people most of them protesters have been killed 
since an aroundtheclock curfew was imposed saturday on srinagar 
and surrounding towns 
one moslem militant was killed wednesday when paramilitary 
forces fearing an attack fired on a mob a senior police official 
said on condition of anonymity 
jagmohan who has a reputation as a tough administrator was 
appointed governor of jammukashmir state by prime minister vp 
singh two weeks ago in an effort to curb the rebellion the most 
serious crisis singh has faced since he took office dec 2 
the islamic militants led by the jammu kashmir liberation 
front demand either independence for the state or union with 
neighboring islamic pakistan 
about 64 percent of jammukashmirs 5 million people are 
moslems nationwide moslems account for 12 percent of indias 880 
million people and hindus make up 82 percent 
singh a hindu like jagmohan has sent hundreds of troops from 
the nations predominantly hindu army and paramilitary forces to 
kashmir 
ethnic tensions flared sunday when a moslem policeman was shot 
to death by soldiers enforcing the curfew government officials 
said the killing was an accident 
on wednesday morning hundreds of state policemen refused to 
work about 300 striking officers gathered on a downtown street 
waving rifles and shouting death to the indian army and 
indians go back 
the strike was called off in the afternoon after jitendra narain 
saxena the states top police officer and mohammad a nomani 
srinagars police inspector general spoke to the protesting 
policemen 
saxena later said it appears that over the years some 
terrorist elements have infiltrated the state police force 
there are 40000 men in the police force 
moslem residents of srinager were jubilant over the strike and 
many embraced officers when the curfew was lifted for an hour in 
the morning 
policemen were resentful of certain things the incident took 
place due to lack of leadership and mismanagement jagmohan said 
without elaborating 
the issue has been sorted out i do not think there is any 
serious problem he said 
but one of the strike leaders constable mohammad afzal said 
another walkout was planned for saturday unless the soldiers leave 
kashmir and the government reinstates a police union banned in 1979 
during the news conference jagmohan rejected suggestions by 
some reporters that most kashmiris wanted to secede and join 
pakistan 
i have come here to help to sort out the problems give me 
some time there is no magic in human affairs he said 
india has often accused pakistan of aiding separatists pakistan 
denies the charge 
claimed by both india and pakistan kashmir was divided into 
indian and pakistani sectors by a ceasefire line that is monitored 
by united nations military observers 
the dispute over the territory which has led to two wars began 
after india and pakistan were partitioned upon gaining independence 
from britain in 1947

the agriculture department under president 
reagan lied about the benefits of a popular nutrition program for 
poor pregnant women and children several members of congress said 
wednesday 
this report makes it plain that the reagan administration 
sought to hide the facts in an earlier agriculture department 
study of the program said sen tom harkin diowa 
but an official of the general accounting office a 
congressional investigative agency said it was not clear that the 
agriculture department had intended to be deceptive in the report 
on the women infants and children food program 
keith fultz of the gao said investigators could not pin down the 
intent behind the changes made in a report on the benefits of the 
program that started in 1972 but said the effect was to mislead 
readers 
he said the summary written by the original researchers was 
deleted by agriculture department officials and replaced by a 
compendium that did not fairly represent what the study team 
found 
that said sen patrick leahy dvt amounts to lying 
gao said that the results written by usda to replace the 
research teams summary would understate the effects of the wic 
program and mislead the readers said leahy in vermont we 
call that lying plain and simple 
the agriculture department study began in 1979 but was not 
released until 1986 a length of time that angered congress 
the project was to take 2 years and cost 39 million said 
harkin instead it was a 6year program costing close to 6 
million 
the comments about the study came at a joint hearing of the 
house select hunger committee and the senate agriculture committee 
which had requested the gao investigation 
budget figures for the last 10 years show that congress 
appropriated 725 million for wic in 1980 and increased the amount 
by at least 100 million each year 
that was not always enough to keep up with inflation and has 
never been enough to reach all the eligible women and children 
said a member of the senate agriculture committee staff but was 
consistently higher than the reagan administration had requested 
in 1982 reagan proposed cutting the program from the 869 
million of the previous year to 637 million congress appropriated 
948 million 
reagan tried in 1983 to cut the program to about 637 million 
that time congress appropriated 11 billion 
the 1990 appropriation is 213 billion serving about 46 
million women and children said birge watkins deputy assistant 
agriculture secretary for food and consumer services 
he said that about twothirds of the eligible recipients are 
getting help through the program 
watkins said the bush administration supports wic believes the 
previous administration was wrong to change the report and would 
never let such a thing happen again 
its simply no way to do business he said we regret this 
whole incident happened 
he said that if the administration had differences with the 
findings of the independent researchers they should have been 
expressed in a cover letter leaving the original summary intact 
the revisions were written by thomas sullivan a special 
assistant to john bode who was assistant secretary for food and 
consumer services for the last four years of the reagan 
administration 
bode now an attorney in a washington law firm said that he now 
believes the compendium was wrong but at the time thought sullivan 
and others at the department who reviewed the study knew what they 
were doing 
but to assert there was willful misrepresentation to congress 
is wrong he said in a telephone interview

navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii on 
wednesday defended a new 12 billion guidedmissile destroyer 
against charges of cost overruns schedule delays and mischarges by 
the contractor 
the ddg51 program is on track to provide our fleet the most 
capable destroyer ever built garrett told a house armed services 
subcommittee on seapower and strategic ans critical materials 
the subcommittee largely agreed with garretts assessment but 
criticized the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress and questioned the propriety of another house panel the 
energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations 
getting involved in an area normally the armed services domain 
it was the chairman of the energy and commerce subcommittee 
rep john dingell dmich who wrote the navy in september and 
complained publicly that the destroyer program is 17 months behind 
schedule and design costs have more than doubled from 111 million 
to 247 million 
rep norman sisisky dva questioned the source of reports 
that the navy and the gao had received fraudhotline allegations of 
mischarging by the destroyers manufacturer bath iron works of 
maine 
we do not publicly announce we have allegations said martin 
m ferber director of the gaos national security and 
international affairs division congressman dingell went public 
with the allegations 
dingell had been asked to testify before the armed services 
panel but said he was unable to do so because of a scheduling 
conflict 
in a fourpage letter to committee chairman charles e bennett 
dfla dingell reiterated his concerns about the program 
the interim findings of the pentagons defense contract 
audit agency and the navy indicate that mischarging did in fact 
occur dingell wrote 
ferber said the gao and navy are investigating those charges 
but that he had no information to substantiate allegations of 
intentional mischarge 
in april 1985 the navy awarded bath iron works a fixedprice 
contract for the destroyer hailed as the worlds most advanced 
surface combat ship 
the ddg51 destroyer is designed with a more expensive allsteel 
superstructure instead of one that was part aluminum and more prone 
to splintering and fire damage the ship also is equipped with 
sophisticated aegis computers and tomahawk cruise missiles 
the navy plans to acquire at least 33 of the arleigh burkeclass 
destroyer at a cost of 27 billion 
ferber said the total target cost for design and construction of 
the lead ship was about 500 million in may 1984 dollars the 
pentagon estimates that the total cost after integrating all the 
systems including the aegis computers will be under 12 billion 
ferber testified that the gao investigation found that design 
problems contributed to two revisions in the ships scheduled 
delivery date of september 1989 bath iron works has accelerated 
construction to meet the new date of february 1991 
william e haggett chairman and chief executive officer of bath 
iron works said his company did not expect any significant 
surprises completing ddg51

president bush on wednesday called upon the 
democratic and republican parties to give money to the campaign of 
violeta chamorro the candidate challenging president daniel ortega 
in nicaraguas feb 25 elections 
bushs letter of request released at the white house caught 
both the republican national committee and the democratic national 
committee by surprise 
the democrats will not likely accommodate the president said 
dnc spokesman mike mccurry 
i dont know why the president seems to think were awash in 
money here said mccurry we dont have as much money as the 
republicans and the money we do have we want to apply to electing 
democrats here in the united states 
the rnc has been extremely supportive of mrs chamorro and 
helped sponsor a fundraising event for her recently in washington 
said rnc spokeswoman leslie goodman but she could not immediately 
say how the gop would respond to the presidents appeal 
we have been supportive in the past well be supportive in 
the future she added 
the bush administration has consistently criticized nicaraguas 
election process claiming the deck is stacked in favor of ortega 
and the ruling sandinistas who control the media and have other 
advantages 
bush said in his letter that that mrs chamorro and her party 
the national opposition union or uno are desperately short of 
funds needed for campaign rallies distributing campaign literature 
and media time as the feb 25 election nears 
congress already has approved bushs request for 9 million to 
help the electoral process in nicaragua that money being 
channelled through the governmentsupported national endowment for 
democracy cannot under neds charter be spent directly on the 
campaign of a candidate rather it is to go to generic political 
activity such as voter registration and building of democratic 
institutions 
the sandinistas bush wrote have imposed serious 
obstacles to delivery of the ned funds and to date uno has been 
permitted to make use of only a tiny fraction of them for these 
reasons mrs chamorros campaign runs the real risk of being 
crippled for lack of money 
bush asked the two parties to make a joint contribution amount 
unspecified and to tap their individual donors for money as well 
a joint contribution by both parties to the uno campaign would 
make an immediate difference at this critical moment as would 
individual contributions by your partys members he wrote 
but mccurry said it seems fairly curious that the president of 
the united states thinks that us political parties should go 
donating to political candidates abroad dnc chairman ron brown 
was traveling in egypt and did not know of the request he said

irancontra arms middleman richard secord was 
placed on probation for two years wednesday for falsely telling 
congressional investigators he was unaware any money in the affair 
had benefited oliver l north 
after his sentencing the retired air force major general 
accused former president reagan of failing to support loyal 
subordinates and operatives in the worst foreign policy debacle of 
the reagan administration 
i think former president reagan has been hiding out i think 
its cowardly secord said when asked about reagans role in the 
affair 
in 1986 when the irancontra operation erupted i think that 
he should have stood up and taken the heat just as previous 
presidents have done in failed covert operations secord told a 
news conference but instead of that they built a wall around 
him 
secord said thenattorney general edwin meese acted in panic 
and out of ignorance on nov 25 1986 when he announced that the 
justice department would examine possible violations of criminal 
law in the affair that was the day meese disclosed that some funds 
from the secret iran arms sales had been diverted to the contras 
reagan maintains he didnt know about the diversion and secord 
said it would be speculative on his part to suggest otherwise 
but the president did not stand up and say this the contra 
resupply operation and iran arms sales was done on my 
authority said secord 
secord said he didnt think there was anything illegal i 
thought at the time we were doing the presidents bidding 
the president told the tower commission on jan 26 1987 that 
he did not know the national security council staff was engaged in 
helping the contras the board is aware of no evidence to suggest 
that the president was aware of lt col norths activities said 
the tower boards final report 
secord was enlisted by thenwhite house aide north to airlift 
weapons and other supplies to the nicaraguan rebels and assist the 
reagan administrations secret arms shipments to iran 
secord who paid for norths 13800 home security system from 
proceeds of the irancontra operation told congressional 
investigators in 1987 he was unaware of any money going to north 
from the scandal 
i deeply regret not being more candid secord told us 
district court judge aubrey robinson if i could correct this i 
certainly would i will regret it for the rest of my life 
secord could have faced up to five years in prison and a 
250000 fine for the false statement but robinson said it was his 
judgment that there has already been punishment in this case 
secord is the fifth person to be sentenced in the irancontra 
affair the others were north former national security adviser 
robert mcfarlane carl channell and richard miller 
north was convicted of three crimes including aiding and 
abetting an obstruction of congress altering and destroying 
national security council documents and accepting an illegal 
gratuity from secord the security system he is appealing 
mcfarlane pleaded guilty to four counts of withholding 
information from congress in connection with inquiries about 
whether secret assistance was going to the contras channell and 
miller were both sentenced to two years probation each pleaded 
guilty to conspiracy to defraud the government of taxes due on 
contributions used to supply military aid to the contras 
secord said his life since the irancontra affair began has been 
pure hell 
he said that he was paid about 240000 in the iran and contra 
operations and that 700000 to 800000 has been raised for his 
defense since 1987 an amount he said doesnt cover all his legal 
expenses 
he said he has his military retirement pay but no job and that 
he had to sell his home and buy a smaller one 
secord said he hopes to start a television talk show which would 
deal with current events one of his topics he said is the theory 
that soviet intelligence actually exposed the administrations iran 
initiative by planting the november 1986 story in a lebanese 
magazine that the united states had sold arms to iran 
the government had alleged that the enterprise the maze of 
offshore companies and secret bank accounts used in the irancontra 
affair managed over 1 million in profits that had been allocated 
to secord some 8 million in enterprise funds is still frozen 
in swiss bank accounts at the request of the us government 
secord told reporters he might be entitled to some legal fees 
from the frozen accounts but i make no personal claim on that 
money i dont intend to put any of that money in my 
pocket 
in approving a plea agreement between secord and the government 
robinson dismissed 11 other criminal charges they include 
allegations that secord lied to congress by saying that the only 
money he made in the affair was his 6000amonth salary 
in court papers filed this week prosecutors said secord now is 
refusing to recant the earlier testimony about his finances 
irancontra prosecutor reid weingarten told judge robinson that 
secord should be dealt with more sternly than north and mcfarlane 
weingarten said north and mcfarlane felt they were committing 
their crimes in the context of having had a higher duty 
north and mcfarlane were cases of misguided patriotism said 
weingarten while we think general secord has no such defense 
the best that can be said of secords false statement is 
that he was motivated by the embarrassment of having paid for 
norths home security system said the prosecutor 
the worst that can be said is that he was trying to avoid the 
consequences of providing benefits to colonel north added 
weingarten this is the stuff of routine felonies

the consumer product safety commission is 
ready to begin finalizing decisions that have been stymied since 
last year because the panel did not have a voting quorum the head 
of the agency said wednesday 
now that we do have a quorum we are back in business and 
were active said chairwoman jacqueline jonessmith 
acknowledging that much business had reached a bottleneck before 
she was appointed in november 
the cpsc mandated in 1973 as a fivemember panel must have at 
least three members before it can take official actions requiring a 
commission vote consumer groups criticized president bush for 
allowing the agency to languish most of last year with just two 
commissioners 
however consumer advocates criticized the jonessmith 
appointment saying she lacked experience on product safety issues 
and consumer affairs critics also called the appointment political 
patronage because her husband republican businessman joshua smith 
helped raise more than 600000 for the bush presidential campaign 
i think i have almost the perfect qualities that are necessary 
for this kind of job jonessmith said 
she was a staff attorney for the federal election commission for 
three years before going to the cpsc she also was an assistant 
attorney for montgomery county md for two years and for six 
years held various management positions in the marylandbased 
maxima corp an integrated information systems company owned by 
her husband 
among the items on the commission calendar are 
recommendations for a new test cylinder to determine the 
smallest allowable size for toys and their parts currently if a 
toy fits into a cylinder with a 1inch diameter and a depth 
ranging from 1 inch to 2 inches it is too small and considered a 
potential choking hazard to small children 
whether mandatory labels are needed for balloons marbles and 
small balls that are exempt from the small parts standards because 
they are marketed for children older than 3 
a vote on mandatory labeling for adult sleepwear the 
commission monday postponed a vote on staff recommendations to 
classify the garments by degree of flammability 
performance standards for childresistant cigarette lighters

gov buddy roemer on wednesday rejected 
a recommendation of clemency for gary tyler a black activist who 
claims he was framed for the murder of a white student during 
desegregation violence in 1974 
tylers long fight for freedom has been supported by amnesty 
international and other groups 
tyler 31 is serving a life sentence with no possibility of 
parole on dec 14 the pardon board voted 32 to reduce his 
sentence to 60 years making him eligible for parole in five years 
i do not concur with the recommendation of the pardon board 
and i deny clemency and a reduction of sentence roemer said in a 
brief statement wednesday 
roemer refused to talk to reporters about his decision which 
was read by his attorney tom casey 
gary tyler was found guilty after a full jury trial said 
casey his conviction has been reviewed extensively by the courts 
over the past 15 years those reviewing courts have found gary 
tylers trial to be fundamentally fair by all legal standards 
also i believe his efforts toward rehabilitation have not 
been sufficient 
tylers case has been supported by marches and rallies 
petitions bearing 12000 signatures were presented to the pardon 
board 
the british reggae band ub40 recorded a song about tyler and he 
was described by the soviet communist party newspaper pravda in 
1978 as a political prisoner 
tyler was a 15yearold activist for school desegregation in 
1974 when whites and blacks clashed at a high school in destrehan 
a small town on the mississippi river 25 miles north of new orleans 
whites surrounded buses carrying black students shouting and 
hurling bottles cans and rocks a shot was fired from one of the 
buses timothy weber 13 standing with his mother across the 
schoolyard fell dead 
witnesses said the pistol was held by a gloved hand tyler was 
the only one on the bus wearing gloves said police 
those who believe tyler was framed say that a student who 
testified against him was known as a liar and that police planted a 
pistol found in the stuffing of the torn seat where tyler had sat 
the pistol later disappeared and defense attorneys claimed the 
laboratory people who tested for fingerprints were incompetent 
an allwhite jury sentenced tyler to die in the electric chair 
but his sentence was automatically reduced to life when the supreme 
court struck down louisianas old death penalty law in 1976

a high school has banned students from 
using book bags in an effort to prevent drugs from being brought to 
school 
baldwin high school principal mike stanton announced the ban 
last week after sheriff bill massee told faculty members that many 
schools with drug problems have banned book bags the ban took 
effect monday 
the parents have not been informed at any point that we have a 
drug and alcohol problem in the school elois finney a parent of 
a baldwin high student told the school board tuesday 
she said parents should have been consulted if we have a 
problem of that magnitude the schools should come up with a program 
to solve it 
the school of 1400 students serves the county of 35000 people 
milledgeville has about 12000 people 
stanton said the school does not have a serious drug problem 
but its all relative even if theres only one student involved 
in drugs here thats one too many 
stanton said the sheriff was invited to speak after teachers 
expressed concern about increasing drug use among students 
the principal said the students are now getting to class 
quicker partly because they must go to their lockers to get their 
books giving them less time to congregate in the halls 
teacher todd shiver said students had become too dependent on 
their bags using them not only for books but gym clothes and junk 
food he said some book bags were so large and full students had to 
drag them down the halls 
some students complained about the difficulties of carrying 
their books without a bag others said banning bags will have 
little effect on the drug problem 
ive seen students with drugs in their socks said sharilyn 
richardson 15 
if they want to get drugs in here theyll find a way to do 
it said james jackson 16

yes we know our tamales members of 
the us military said tuesday and the powdery substance found in 
manuel antonio noriegas home was definitely not tamales 
but it wasnt cocaine either 
us army officers had first said that nearly 50 kilograms or 
110 pounds of cocaine had been found in noriegas home the day 
after the dec 20 invasion bolstering us charges of drug 
trafficking against the panamanian strongman 
but published reports this week said the army acknowledged later 
that the substance found in the house was tamales not cocaine 
southern command spokesmen reacted angrily tuesday saying the 
army never claimed it had found tamales 
many of the us servicemen here hail from the southwest and 
should be able to recognize a tamale when they see one 
tamales cornmeal and meat either pork beef or chicken come 
in many different forms they vary from the thick cornhuskwrapped 
tamale of northern mexico and southwestern united states to a 
rectangular tamale wrapped in a banana leaf popular along the 
mexican gulf coast central america and panama 
the panamanian variety is most popular around christmas and is 
made with cornmeal and chicken meat in the capital and with pork in 
the provinces 
we said that our soldiers found some white powder wrapped in 
banana leaves in a refrigerator said capt art haubold of the 
southern commands public affairs office the substance was taken 
to a lab and it was determined after that is was not cocaine 
the best they could determine was that it was some bonding 
substance used in voodoo rituals thats the way it was described 
to us by army experts at first it could have been mistaken by a 
layman as cocaine 
army officials also said tuesday they never indicated any direct 
connection existed between the former dictator and drugs found by 
soldiers as they searched noriegas homes and hundreds of other 
houses and offices in panama 
it was not our job to determine that haubold said 
according to the army 415 kilograms of cocaine 100 grams of 
crack cocaine 10 kilograms of marijuana and 255 kilograms of 
heroin were found and confiscated by the us army from dec 20 
through jan 9 in search operations throughout panama the total 
included small amounts found on suspects picked up for questioning 
and in private homes 
a kilogram equals 22 pounds and a gram 0035 ounces 
a total of 283 kilograms of cocaine were found in the offices of 
the national investigation office but a source said it could not 
be determined whether it had been previously confiscated by the law 
enforcement agency

a sailor accused of murdering two shipmates at 
a topsecret nuclear submarine base and then killing himself was 
given a full military funeral wednesday 
relatives said they suspect a navy coverup 
three uniformed sailors removed a us flag from shyam david 
drizpauls casket and presented it to his mother at a service at a 
funeral home 
after the ceremony the sailors mother seelochna drizpaul 
wept over the casket crying oh god this is not real this is 
not real you are not dead my son 
the navy has reported drizpaul 23 a fire control technician 
3rd class aboard the uss michigan a topsecret trident nuclear 
submarine in bangor wash shot and killed two shipmates and a 
pawn shop clerk in nearby bremerton wash before apparently 
killing himself last week in a motel room 
but relatives claim drizpaul a native of guyana was an 
intelligent responsible person who did not fit the description of 
a killer 
the family was orginally told they would have to make 
arrangements to claim the body and that drizpaul would not be given 
a military funeral said an uncle yoganand kumar 
but calls to us rep les aspin and sen herbert kohl both 
dwis helped persuade the navy to provide the honor guard kumar 
said 
they find the man dead and they say theyre not responsible 
for him we werent satisfied he said 
kumar said before the funeral that the family doubts the navys 
explanation and is upset because details about the deaths have not 
been released 
nothing makes sense there are a lot of questions that havent 
been answered he said whats going on what are they trying to 
cover up were not saying he didnt do it were saying tell us 
what happened 
petty officer paul gamache of osseo wis who escorted 
drizpauls body from washington to milwaukee told mourners 
drizpauls coworkers aboard the submarine were surprised by the 
allegations 
gamache who knew drizpaul for 18 months said the navys 
allegations about drizpaul did not really seem like the guy we 
knew 
he always performed every job ever asked of him in a very 
professional manner he took pride in his work gamache said 
another uncle vasant kumar told mourners drizpaul was a 
dedicated son who came to the united states at age 6 and joined the 
navy after high school 
he was the only son to his mother and the violent 
circumstances of his passing compounds the familys grief it is a 
curious thing but we know nothing about his work except he worked 
in a submarine we feel he gave his life for his country kumar 
said 
the familys attorney larry scruggs jr said he planned to 
conduct his own investigation 
but police capt dennis plumb who is heading the civilian 
investigation in bremerton said police had talked to a witness to 
the shooting of the pawn shop clerk and had little doubt that 
drizpaul was the killer 
according to the navy drizpaul shot and killed two sailors at 
the living quarters they shared at the base on jan 15 the next 
morning he killed a pawn shop clerk and critically wounded her 
brother while taking a pistol from the shop the navy said 
drizpaul was found dead from an apparently selfinflicted 
gunshot wound on jan 17 at a motel near vancouver wash 
authorities said

marion barry the absent host mayor was a 
prime topic of private and sometimespublic discussion wednesday as 
colleagues in the us conference of mayors began a threeday 
meeting marked by growing concerns about the nations drug problems 
as we see him moving to get treatment for himself we are 
caused to realize once again how important it is that treatment be 
available not only to those in high places but to everyone who 
needs it the conferences president houston mayor kathy 
whitmire said after a speech at the national press club 
members of the bigcity mayors task force on drugs convened for 
a strategy session meanwhile with panel member barry absent 
undergoing treatment in florida 
no mayor publicly mentioned barrys arrest last week on a 
cocaine possession charge during the task force meeting but he 
dominated their talk outside the meeting room 
it was a tragedy for the mayor and it was a tragedy for the 
district of columbia said philadelphia mayor wilson goode i 
dont see how it has any impact on what we do here 
it epitomizes it symbolizes the extent of the drug problem 
in this country said boston mayor raymond flynn 
flynn said id like to see an acknowledgement of marion 
barrys problem by the mayor he said that if barry is cured of 
any substance dependence problem he should spend the rest of his 
life as an example to young people about the problems of drugs 
whitmire praised the bush administrations antidrug efforts in 
her speech at the press club but said mayors are looking for more 
direct federal aid to the cities without the grants going through 
state governments 
her only mention of barry came in response to a question she 
said the arrest and his decision to seek treatment at a florida 
drugandalcoholism center underscored the broader need for drug 
treatment opportunities she said that as long as there is a demand 
for drugs dealers and producers will find ways to meet that demand 
she and other mayors shied away from saying whether they 
believed barry should resign from office because of the cocaine 
arrest 
im not going to try to give any political advice to any other 
mayors she said 
barrys appointed antidrug official for the city sterling 
tucker sat in barrys chair at the meeting of the drug task force 
barry is also chairman of the mayors transportation committee 
conference spokesman mike brown said another mayor would fill in 
for barry when the panel meets thursday 
the mayors are awaiting president bushs latest plans for 
federal antidrug efforts and they released a study concluding 
that only a small portion of federal drugenforcement aid has made 
it to the nations cities 
the study said city governments received just 15 percent of the 
150 million in federal funds available for drug enforcement 
through the two main grant programs during the last fiscal year 
bush plans to address the mayors most of whom are democrats 
on friday it will be the first time since jimmy carter in 1980 
that an incumbent president has spoken to the organization of 
bigcity mayors 
among black mayors sharpe james of newark nj said he did 
not embrace the suggestion of naacp executive director benjamin 
hooks that the arrest was part of a pattern of harassment of black 
elected officials and a rising tide of racism but he said 
racism would be a factor in law enforcement until we rule out 
racism in our country 
another black mayor cardell cooper of east orange nj said 
i do believe black leadership has come under certainly 
scrutiny i dont know if youd call it undue or not he said 
barry might have put himself in position to invite attention 
and scrutiny 
a third black mayor said he did not see barrys case as a 
particular embarrassment for black officeholders or one that makes 
their antidrug efforts more difficult 
it only proves mayors are human said mayor john daniels of 
new haven conn

the us government on wednesday criticized 
south african police for using force to break up a protest in cape 
town 
we deplore the use of force to stifle peaceful protest 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler told reporters we 
have long urged an end to violence and repression as an important 
step in the process of change in south africa 
ms tutwiler commented when asked about the polices use on 
tuesday of rubber bullets tear gas and water cannon to disperse 
more than 5000 black and mixedrace students who were protesting 
government education policies 
she reiterated the us call for the south african government to 
lift its state of emergency and restrictions on political activity 
and noted that president fw de klerk has allowed several other 
political demonstrations to take place 
those protests she said were peaceful and contributed to the 
opening of a dialogue between all south africans 
during the difficult period ahead in which the process of 
moving towards negotiations may sometimes become overheated we ask 
all parties in south africa to practice restraint and good sense in 
the search for a peaceful avenue for change ms tutwiler said

west germany said wednesday that 
a concrete warning about possible terrorists aboard a libyan 
airliner prompted its police to hold and search the aircraft for 
hours at frankfurt airport 
the action tuesday drew a strong protest from col moammar 
gadhafis libyan government 
the libyan arab airlines plane was allowed to return to tripoli 
wednesday 
border police detained and searched the boeing 727 at frankfurt 
tuesday shortly after it arrived from the libyan capital with 75 
passengers plus crew 
chief government spokesman hans klein refused to divulge the

would not say if it was a foreign intelligence service 
federal security officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said there was a tip terrorists might have been aboard 
interior ministry spokesman roland bachmeier told reporters 
three armed men were detained for carrying weapons without permits 
but were released after they turned out to be the airlines 
security guards 
bachmeier defended the governments actions saying west germany 
must take seriously such a warning he said any other eaction 
would be gross negligence and contrary to duty

the soviet union is cooperating with dutch 
authorities in trying to locate and return a valuable collection of 
old master drawings that was sold illegally to the nazis and seized 
by russian troops during world war ii artnews magazine reported 
wednesday 
a copyrighted article in the magazines february issue which 
will appear on newsstands monday said that after years of balking 
at dutch diplomatic efforts to repatriate the drawings the soviets 
agreed to cooperate during a meeting with dutch cultural official 
jan riezenkamp in moscow last october 
the focus of the dutch governments search is a collection of 
491 old master drawings valued at 50 million to 75 million that 
once belonged to franz koenigs a germanborn dutch industrialist 
who assembled the art works in the 1920s 
the collection included works by correggio rembrandt titian 
anthony van dyck albrecht durer jeanhonore fragonard hans 
holbein filippino lippi peter paul rubens jacopo tintoretto and 
antoine watteau 
dutch concern over recovering the missing drawings from the 
soviet union was heightened when two of the drawings surfaced 
recently in new york and london in the hands of private dealers and 
collectors the magazine said their reappearance prompted the 
dutch government to file lawsuits for the drawings return 
artnews said a large portion of the koenigs collection was sold 
illegally to adolf hitlers agent hans posse in rotterdam during 
world war ii for an art museum that hitler planned to build in his 
native austria posse often bought art at forced sales from 
unwilling sellers paying far below market value the magazine said 
the koenigs drawings were moved to dresden germany which came 
under soviet occupation after the war the drawings and millions 
of other art treasures were transferred to the soviet union where 
the drawings disappeared and were feared destroyed 
the magazine said soviet and east german authorities repeatedly 
rebuffed dutch efforts to locate and repatriate the drawings during 
the 1940s and 1950s it quoted riezenkamp as crediting soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs liberal policies for the recent 
change in soviet attitude toward the dutch requests 
riezenkamp now believes at least some of the drawings eventually 
will be repatriated with soviet cooperation said the magazine 
which is published in new york

united states 
however embassy spokeswoman agota kuperman said the united 
states gave 500000 worth of assistance to romania through the

poland 
the organization americare has provided more than 1 million 
worth of assistance to romania he said

the white house worried about exposing 
reporters to danger during next months drug summit in colombia 
may put most of the press corps covering president bush in another 
country such as panama costa rica or venezuela spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said wednesday 
he said there was a good chance the press would be located 
somewhere other than colombia when bush visits there feb 15 for 
several hours of talks with president virgilio barco and officials 
of peru and bolivia 
other countries under consideration for the press include 
jamaica puerto rico and aruba 
the alternatesite plan would run counter to a longstanding 
policy of having the press corps close to bush on foreign trips 
there have been numerous reports of threatened violence against 
bush and others in colombia by cocaine drug lords angry about a 
government crackdown against their operations 
most recently cbs news said drug terrorists were buying 
surfacetoair missiles to try to shoot down bushs plane 
fitzwater said the secret service was confident it could provide 
protection for bush in colombia but that it has no authority to do 
the same for reporters 
tentative plans had called for the white house to set up filing 
facilities for the press at a commercial airport at cartagena near 
the expected summit site 
fitzwater said there was a lot of deep concern about having it 
at the airport since it was exposed to the general population 
the way to answer that concern he said is to put it 
someplace else 
traditionally 11 reporters accompany bush on air force one as a 
pool while the remainder of the press travel on a plane 
chartered by the white house and paid for by their companies 
the pool frequently is expanded to permit more photographers 
cameramen and reporters into situations where coverage is limited 
fitzwater said that under the plan being considered a pool of 
undetermined size would accompany bush to the actual summit while 
the overwhelming majority of the press would go elsewhere 
he said he had talked with a number of reporters about the idea 
and that they were generally favorable to having the filing 
center in another country 
fitzwater said that anybody who doesnt like it is free to go 
to cartagena on their own however it was unclear how anyone 
who traveled independently could get access to bush and the summit 
proceedings 
the press secretary said he was examining logistics about an 
alternate site such as how the press would be briefed on summit 
developments and the possibility that bush might go to the filing 
center afterward for a news conference 
the one thing im worried about are those sam surfacetoair 
missiles that you can be back quite a distance and you can launch 
those numbers and you can create some trouble said rep john 
conyers dmich who just returned from a congressional trip to 
colombia bolivia and peru 
conyers discussed security with bush after a meeting on the 
presidents decision to support cabinet status for the 
environmental protection agency 
i know that they can secure the immediate area around 
cartagena conyers said but if theyve got sam missiles the 
insurgents thats a security problem i hope theyve thought 
about

guarded border to yugoslavia the tanjug news agency reported

yugoslav agency said the four carried weapons but did not 
elaborate

tightly controlled country and the last holdout for stalinism on 
the continent and escapes are extremely rare

repeatedly in yugoslav greek and other western media but could not

albania but gave no source for its information and offered no 
details

railings of the albanian embassy on wednesday to protest a visit by 
albanias foreign undersecretary but police cut the chains and the

the second phase of the national drug control 
strategy to be unveiled thursday by president bush will call for 
spending more than 105 billion on the war against drugs in 1991 
at least 1 billion more than this year an administration source 
said wednesday 
money for the pentagons effort to battle drugs would rise about 
50 percent from 880 million this year to 12 billion in fiscal 
1991 a draft of the strategy said 
congress allocated about 88 billion for the drug war this 
fiscal year about 900 million more than the 79 billion sought 
by bush in the strategy unveiled in september 
but the new strategy basing drug war expenditures on new base 
figures says the country is now spending 95 billion not 88 
billion said the source who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
they have gone through the accounts at the various agencies so 
you can make straightline accounts from year to year the 
official said as part of the process of going through all this 
they found that it is appropriate and possible to attribute moneys 
that had not previously been attributed to drugs 
in the new strategy the prioryear totals have been altered to 
reflect the changes so that the administration cannot be accused of 
improperly inflating the figures for 1991 the official said 
the new strategy will also intensify federal antidrug efforts 
in five areas immediately said other administration sources all 
of whom requested anonymity 
those areas metropolitan new york miami houston los angeles 
and virtually all of the southwest border will be designated as 
highintensity drugtrafficking regions and will benefit this year 
from 25 million previously approved by congress to fight drugs in 
the worstafflicted regions and from as much as 21 million from 
the federal assetforfeiture fund the sources said 
by and large the strategys focus will remain as it was in the 
original plan 
harsh stateimposed penalties for drug users 
intensified treatment and prevention efforts 
bigger budgets for law enforcement at all levels 
one source said that the targeting of five areas in the war 
against drugs this year will not mean more money for local 
governments 
those governments wont see any checks said the source 
what they will see is increased awareness and cooperation from 
the feds that type of thing the money is going to the feds for 
them to increase their efforts to highlight their presence in 
those areas 
the federal antidrug effort will also target regions 
surrounding designated cities the source said 
he said the los angeles metropolitan area will include los 
angeles and orange county 
a draft of the strategy says the new york area includes nassau 
county in new york and essex county in new jersey 
the miami area includes broward dade and monroe counties the 
houston area includes harris and galveston counties 
the southwest region includes 35 counties in california 
arizona new mexico and texas 
other counties in each area may be included in the final version 
of the strategy the source said 
whether these regions will be targeted for 1991 as well remains 
undecided the source said 
if were successful we would anticipate that these spots will 
move the source said as the emphasis increases on the 
southwest border the drug traffickers will go toward louisiana 
or inland or to canada and come down well have to monitor it to 
see what happens the second time around 
the updated strategy also will propose a broadening of federal 
drug crimes for which the death penalty can be imposed in line 
with changes bush said last year that he wanted to make 
those proposals call for allowing the death penalty to be 
imposed on drug kingpins even when they or their organizations have 
not killed anyone on kingpins who attemp to kill to obstruct 
justice and on federal drug felons whose offenses result in death 
such as an overdose by a drug user 
another new idea in the draft strategy is for the development 
of large drug treatment campuses located on public land serving 
thousands of patients with a range of stateofthe art treatment 
methods and associated social services 
other programs slated for substantial spending increases in 
1991 if congress approves are block grants to states for 
treatment and law enforcement the drug enforcement administration 
and its state and local task forces the fbi the immigration and 
naturalization service for inspectors and border patrols the 
customs service the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the 
organized crime drug enforcement task force program and the us 
marshals services transportation and detention program as well as 
its witnessprotection program 
the draft strategy also calls for greatly intensified efforts to 
eradicate domestic marijuana production and proposes more money for 
the national institute of drug abuse in part so that it can 
conduct its household survey of drug use annually rather than 
every three years 
william j bennett director of the office of national drug 
control policy and budget director richard darman were reported by 
an administration official last month to be apart by more than a 
couple of hundred million dollars on the 1991 drug war budget 
sources said wednesday that darman won the battle saying 
bennett originally had requested a 20 percent to 30 percent 
increase

the paintbrushwielding magician who made 
several billboards disappear under coats of white paint said 
wednesday hes fed up with glamorous ads touting tobacco and 
alcohol in innercity neighborhoods 
but a billboard company spokesman said the paint jobs are 
vandalism 
the painter whos taken the pseudonym mandrake after the 
comicstrip magician said billboard ads in predominantly black and 
hispanic neighborhoods on the south side are aimed at young people 
and promote dangerous vices 
mandrake who described himself as a 54yearold black 
professional but declined to give his real name said hes taken a 
paintbrush to billboards three times in broad daylight because the 
ads corrupt young people 
i have seen over the past two years a disproportionate amount 
of advertising in the black and hispanic community he said in a 
telephone interview i believe it was time for us to stand up and 
fight back 
im a firm believer in the constitution and believe the law 
was broken but at the same time there is a moral obligation a 
right that must be addressed he said 
geoff obrzut a spokesman for national billboard company patrick 
media said he filed a police report wednesday 
hes obviously vandalizing private property obrzut said in 
a telephone interview we would be willing to prosecute if hes 
caught 
mandrakes actions have helped fuel a controversy over the 
targeting of minorities by alcohol and tobacco companies 
on one side stand consumer advocates alarmed by the number of 
people from innercity communities dying from smoking and 
drinkingrelated illnesses 
on the other side are industry representatives who dismiss 
attacks on such advertising as an infringement of the 
constitutional right to freedom of speech industry representatives 
contend that ads specifically aimed at minorities are harmless and 
that people make their own decision about whether to light up or 
take a drink 
however the lung cancer rate has increased four times faster 
among blacks than among whites in the past 30 years according to 
reports from the american lung association and the national cancer 
institute 
a 1987 study by the center for science in the public interest a 
health advocacy group based in washington found that black men 
have a 70 percent higher death rate from cirrhosis of the liver 
than whites 
the health advocacy group contends that children are being 
encouraged by the billboard ads 
children on the way to school and back home or even at recess 
get the message that the way to be happy glamorous or athletic is 
to smoke andor drink a center publication said 
obrzut disagreed saying that while 50 percent of billboard 
advertising does occur in the inner city a company study found 
that only 16 percent of chicagos 2500 billboards were alcohol or 
tobaccorelated 
gary miller a spokesman for the american tobacco institute in 
washington said studies also show that young people become smokers 
primarily because of peer group pressures and parental influence 
he said tobacco companies might advertise to minorities because 
more minorities than whites tend to be smokers 
just like an effective advertisement you try to reach those 
people to whom it appeals miller said in a telephone interview 
janet flynn of the distilled spirits council of the united 
states echoed millers sentiments saying we restrict our 
advertising to responsible adult customers 
advocacy groups say advertisers only respond to pressure 
in baltimore pressure from various groups led an advertising 
company to remove much of its blackoriented advertising 
and rj reynolds tobacco co recently scrapped plans to test 
market uptown a new cigarette aimed at the black community after 
opposition from the national association for the advancement of 
colored people

thousands of russians were evacuated wednesday 
state television said the port terminal came under attack from 
ships of the caspian sea oil fleet and two soldiers were wounded

residents 
captains of the oil tankers and barges were said to have 
threatened to blow up their vessels if military vessels tried to 
break through 
red army soldiers moved into the azerbaijani capital saturday to 
quell a nationalist uprising and antiarmenian riots 
ms kasumova said the 40minute harbor battle began when a 
military cutter tried to break through the blockade and troops

jail for 30 days if they tried to organize such protests 
soviet media reported growing threats against the russian 
population of baku from azerbaijanis reacting to the armys attacks

after curfew wednesday night so the building would not be 
surrounded by demonstrators said legislative spokesman nizami 
sakyakhov 
jeikhun mulazade a political scientist said it would consider 
breaking with the national party as lithuanian communists did last 
month and would elect a new first secretary to replace 
abdulrakhman vezirov who was fired after soviet troops entered 
baku 
ms yunusova the activist said vezirov had been expelled from 
the party and criminal charges might be brought against him

town of yeraskh broke down wednesday tass reported but it said 
said efforts were under way to set up negotiations in other border 
areas

blockade by azerbaijan that has caused a severe fuel shortage tass 
reported 
it said 10 freight trains finally had been permitted through 
azerbaijan but a section of track in a predominantly azerbaijani 
section of georgia was dismantled causing an accident that injured 
four passengers and cutting armenias last rail link with the rest 
of the soviet union

hooded protesters exchanged gunfire 
with police wednesday at central university and at least two 
protesters were wounded as unrest flared anew over the governments 
austerity measures 
the street battle broke out about noon as the protesters most 
of them teenagers gathered rocks assembled firebombs out of beer 
bottles and distributed pamphlets to students at venezuelas 
largest university 
battles between police and rioters on university grounds had 
died down since riots last march over austerity cuts and steep 
price hikes on food and public transportation left about 300 dead 
the 11monthold government of social democratic president 
carlos andres perez plans to cut subsidies on gasoline prices and 
labor union officials said wednesday they will stage protests 
beginning next month perez wants to reduce venezuelas 80 percent 
annual inflation rate and the 34 billion foreign debt 
were a small group maybe fifty but we represent the 
discontents of the majority of venezuelans said a hooded 
teenager who called himself cinco 
were out here again after a year of quiet to again do 
battle with the bourgeois forces of repression said cinco 
were hoping the people will take to the streets again 
a student nearby called the protest a traditional activity 
its the students duty to protest because we are unhappy 
with a series of problems facing the country he said citing the 
rising cost of living 
the government has warned that gasoline prices in venezuela 
some of the cheapest in the world will be raised within a few 
months 
the protesters wearing hoods edged close to the universitys 
main gate as lines of metropolitan police in riot gear with tear 
gas canisters on the ends of their rifles crouched behind cars in 
a plaza outside 
a hooded boy pulled out a homemade gun and fired at the police 
setting off the battle 
with battle cries the group of protesters threw rocks and 
firebombs while the police fired tear gas canisters but the wind 
pushed most of the tear gas back at police 
occasionally shotgun pellets whistled overhead from the police 
after a few hours the fighting slowly finally died down after 
police advanced to the gate and the protesters along with 
students in team uniforms playing soccer on a field retreated 
into classroom buildings 
two protesters were hit by shotgun pellets as they braved the 
police fire headon carlos salgado an economics student was hit 
in the chest and arm and checked into the university infirmary an 
unidentified protester was hit in the shoulder but continued to do 
battle 
students began to troop out of the main entrance tired of 
waiting for the protesters to give up police waited patiently 
we have them behind the line its only a small number of 
troublemakers said sheriff raul vivas commander of a 
metropolitan police antiriot brigade 
he said police suffered no injuries 
the nations largest labor union the confederation of 
venezuelan workers or ctv said they would call for marches 
against the planned gasoline price hike starting february 15

the head of the federal communications 
commission told congress on wednesday he wants more stringent rules 
against drug involvement by broadcasters 
the commission chairman alfred sikes wrote rep john dingell 
dmich chairman of the energy and commerce committee that he had 
asked the commission staff for a thorough examination of the 
commissions 1986 character policy statement 
the current policy which was adopted under fcc chairman mark s 
fowler does not say whether such things as drug possession and 
pending drug charges against broadcasters should be taken into 
account during license proceedings 
until the 1986 fcc ruling any felony conviction automatically 
had been considered relevant to an applicants suitability to hold 
a broadcast license but the commission narrowed the scope of 
issues it was willing to consider 
there is no scarcity of lawabiding citizens interested in 
being broadcast licensees sikes wrote dingell today there 
are also fewer objective requirements associated with holding a 
broadcast license consequently in my view current or prospective 
broadcast licensees should be held to a higher standard than is 
reflected in the current policy statement 
dingell whose committee oversees the commission said sikes 
position is a refreshing change 
his commitment to thoroughly reexamining that policy goes a 
long way toward restoring my confidence in the fccs judgment and 
willingness to regulate in the public interest said dingell who 
battled continually with sikes deregulationminded predecessors 
fowler and dennis r patrick 
sikes last september announced the commission automatically 
would consider drug dealing convictions as possible grounds for 
yanking a broadcasters license but he did not mention drug 
possession convictions 
congress when it passed the 1988 antidrug abuse act denied 
federal benefits to drug violators but it did not say whether 
an fcc license was a federal benefit 
sikes wrote that although the commission had some discretion in 
drug matters involving broadcasters drug possession is not 
specifically mentioned as within the scope of the character policy 
statement 
misdemeanor drug convictions that do not deny federal benefits 
under the 1988 drug law also are not mentioned in the policy 
statement sikes said therefore such a conviction would not be 
considered relevant to an applicants basic qualifications in a 
license renewal or transfer proceeding sikes said 
the policy statement also does not mention drugassociated 
activities such as money laundering extortion theft burglary or 
robbery it says specifically that homicide will not disqualify an 
applicant 
but sikes said the commission retains the discretion to 
consider misconduct that is so egregious as to shock the 
conscience 
in felony cases sikes added an applicant may buy or sell a 
station until the charges are proven the commission could 
however grant approval of a license contingent upon the outcome of 
the pending criminal proceeding 
applicants convicted of misconduct at one station may not 
automatically be disqualified from owning other stations sikes 
said 
the commissions drug policy was called into question when in 
1988 it renewed the license of williamsburg county broadcasting 
corp to operate wkspam in kingstree sc after the companys 
principal owner gregory knop was convicted of a cocaine charge 
in its september revisions the commission said knops 
conviction raised questions about williamsburgs qualifications to 
hold the license

israeli labor party leader shimon peres said 
he and president hosni mubarak discussed new ideas on wednesday 
to overcome difficulties blocking israelipalestinian peace talks 
i think i will be going back home with some messages of 
importance said peres deputy premier and finance minister 
after a meeting of about 90 minutes with mubarak 
as he did when he arrived tuesday night peres said agreement is 
close on convening an israelipalestinian dialogue in cairo as a 
step toward peace negotiations 
but israel radio on wednesday quoted a spokesman for prime 
minister yitzhak shamir as disputing peres optimistic appraisal 
in washington secretary of state james a baker iii said when 
asked about peres optimistic statements im not sure that i 
would have used the characterization that mr peres used im not 
sure that im that encouraged i think we still have a long ways to 
go 
upon landing at tel aviv from cairo peres called bakers 
comment a matter of judgment 
i think that the problems that are still outstanding can be 
solved now he said these are matters in which the 
immagination is richer than the problem 
peres whose labor party joined shamirs likud bloc in a 
coalition cabinet in 1988 after inconclusive parliamentary 
elections did not say who presented the ideas he discussed with 
mubarak nor did he indicate whether the messages he was taking 
home from cairo are mubaraks views or the egyptian presidents 
reactions to israeli ideas 
peres said however that some of the ideas concern composition 
of the palestinian delegation to the proposed dialogue in cairo 
which egypt and the united states are pushing this and the agenda 
have been major stumbling blocks 
the remaining problems between us and the palestinians can be 
solved rather swiftly and in a very short while peres said 
there are some new ideas introduced to do so 
he reiterated that both he and shamir oppose any participation 
in the peace process by the palestine liberation organization but 
unlike the hardline prime minister peres favored including in the 
delegation palestinians deported by israel from the occupied west 
bank and gaza for ties with the plo 
the palestinian delegation should be a nonplo delegation 
representing the people in the occupied territories and not 
people active outside the territories peres said 
he replied with a terse yes when asked if deportees included 
people who were not plo members and were not implicated in 
terrorist acts 
the plo has insisted on playing a role in the peace process on 
forming the palestinian delegation and on being seen to do so 
israel refuses to deal with the plo dismissing its members as 
terrorists 
in outlining his concept of the delegation peres said it should 
be free to consult with any arabs since it is not made up of 
israeli citizens but of jordanians 
he did not elaborate the west bank was under jordans control 
and gaza was under egypts before israel conquered them in the 1967 
middle east war peres always has viewed jordan as a principal 
partner in peace talks and shamir contends that jordan is the 
palestinian homeland 
on the agenda of the palestinianisraeli dialogue peres hinted 
at a possible compromise he suggested that participants could 
address any subject in opening statements but confine themselves 
subsequently to discussion of israeliproposed palestinian 
elections in the west bank and gaza the polling would be to choose 
negotiators on limited interim autonomy 
once we have agreed that the heart of the agenda will be 
arranging the elections in the territories the opening speech or 
speeches are becoming of secondary consideration peres said 
shamir wants the agenda restricted to the mechanics of 
elections the plo and egypt acting on the organizations behalf 
say other subjects can be raised and the united states agrees with 
that view 
he urged syria which lost its golan heights to israel in 1967 
to join in the process and expressed willingness to meet with 
syrias president hafez assad in egypt the only arab state at 
peace with israel

the agrarian party for more than 40 
years a pawn of bulgarias communists on wednesday proposed an 
interim government of national consensus that would hold free 
elections the state news agency bta reported 
the communistdominated reformist government meanwhile said it 
will hand parliament an economic reform program thursday designed 
to lay the groundwork for a market economy by allowing pluralism 
of ownership in all its forms 
the government wants bulgarias first free elections since world 
war ii to be held in may the opposition has requested most of the 
voting for parliament be delayed until november to give itself time 
to develop campaign strategies 
the agrarian party a member of the governing coalition in the 
national assembly or parliament has tried to distance itself from 
the communists as elections approach 
the national assembly voted this month to abolish the 
communists guaranteed monopoly on power setting the stage for an 
end to 42 years of authoritarian oneparty rule 
on tuesday justice minister svetla daskalova an agrarian 
leader asked that any reference to bulgaria as a socialist 
state be deleted from the constitution 
on wednesday the agrarian partys ruling council passed a 
motion calling for a broadbased provisional government of 
national consensus made up of all factions now engaged in talks 
here bta reported 
the talks among the communists the 12party opposition union of 
democratic forces and other political and social groups are aimed 
at achieving national consensus on the speed and sweep of 
democratization in bugaria 
the agrarian motion will be submitted to the national assembly 
and the next session of talks bta said 
the communist leadership has agreed to an opposition newspaper 
and office space but balks at giving the opposition access to 
radio and television a must for propagating democratic ideas and 
gaining electoral support in this largely rural nation 
as proposed by the agrarian party a government of national 
consensus would arrange free elections and move to remedy 
bulgarias economic crisis aggravated by a foreign debt of up to 
12 billion 
such an interim government would speed bulgarias economic 
integration with the outside world and its affiliation with 
westernoriented world economic organizations like the 
international monetary fund and the organization for economic 
cooperation and development bta reported 
bta said the governments economic plan would attempt to bolster 
bulgarias financial situation by cutting capital investments and 
administrative expenditures acting to increase the strength of 
banks and the credit system 
further details were not available such as a timetable for 
transforming bulgarias highly centralized communist economy into a 
market economy 
the union of democratic forces says western aid is vital to 
conquer the economic crisis here and that it must be used for 
radical economic reforms 
udf chairman zhelyu zhelev said on tv wednesday that without 
economic reform we can find ourselves in the same situation as 
before when aid disappeared like water into sand according to 
bta 
economic aid should be associated with democratization if 
there is no such link the past can make a comeback 
zhelev denied the opposition is out to defeat the communist 
party 
we are against the monopoly of the communist party not 
against the party itself in a lawabiding democratic multiparty 
state there will be room for the commmunist party and for all other 
political parties as well he said 
the reforms that coursed eastern europe last fall swept out 
todor zhivkov as bulgarias communist ruler on nov 10 after 35 
years in power

reforms in eastern europe should not 
divert aid from third world countries and eventually could provide 
additional resources to underdeveloped nations a un official 
said wednesday 
enrique ter horst assistant secretarygeneral for development 
and international economic cooperation said at a news conference 
that changes in eastern europe are requiring large amounts of 
resources necessary for them to get out of their present 
quandry 
but he said un officials believe problems facing developing 
countries remain the most important concerns in efforts toward 
international economic development 
it is to be expected since these countries do have a large 
pool of welltrained professionals and technicians that they 
should be on their feet economically speaking relatively quickly 
the un official said of the eastern european nations 
we hope that they will be able also to provide markets for 
commodities from developing countries and also join the western 
developed countries in providing official development assistance 
for countries mainly in africa which need it 
a un report on economic development released wednesday said 
world economic growth and the average increase in per capita income 
in the 1980s were the lowest in three decades 
according to the report developing countries have suffered the 
most because of the decline in growth with many people there worse 
off in 1990 than they were in 1980 
some developing countries in asia however achieved steady 
income increases the past decade the report cited china and india 
the two most populous lowincome countries as having improved 
their economic conditions during the 1980s 
but many countries particularly in africa and latin america 
experienced a collapse in commodity prices the past decade while 
facing mounting indebtedness inadequate funds from foreign sources 
and falling income levels the report said 
in addition increased protectionism eroded trade for the 
developing countries the report said 
particular attention should be given to commoditydependent 
economies who are already under pressure as a result of their 
structural rigidities debtservicing difficulties and the 
inadequacy of development finance international financial flows to 
developing countries are regarded as an important catalytic device 
in the development process the report said 
the united nations will convene a special session on economic 
development on feb 26

latin american countries will have to rely 
less on foreign borrowing as they try to rebuild their economies 
from the debt crisis of the 1980s world bank president barber 
conable said wednesday 
except possibly in eastern europe no group of nations is 
facing such a daunting task of reform and reconstruction as latin 
america conable said in a speech at the colegio de mexico a 
graduate school and thinktank 
to recover countries will have to shrink the size of government 
bureaucracies that expanded from the fifties through last decade 
into financing industry infrastructure social services and 
security as well as increasing their foreign borrowings conable 
said 
we have learned from the experience of developing countries 
and socialist countries of eastern europe that excessively 
centralized economic management leads to such inefficiencies that 
ultimately economic development comes to a halt he said 
in brazil today he said salaries of public employees and 
interest on the domestic debt take up 90 percent of public sector 
revenue leaving little for investment or public services 
the world bank will continue to participate in latin american 
development he said but countries should look to direct foreign 
private investment to replace some of the public borrowing 
the channels for the flow of commercial capital to developing 
countries have been damaged by the debt crisis he said 
external capital will no longer flow in quantities and with the 
ease with which it was available in the 70s and even if it did 
developing countries should not borrow as they did in the 70s 
three latin countries head the list of developing countries that 
owe foreign debtors the most brazil then mexico and argentina 
he said latin america and africa had been most severely hit by 
the crisis 
more developing countries have suffered reverses in the past 
decade than have experienced success 
conable called mexicos economic reform program one of the 
most ambitious courageous and determined recently undertaken by 
any country and said it could serve as an example for other latin 
nations 
to bring foreign and domestic debt under control and rein in 
runaway inflation mexico has reduced subsidies lifted trade 
barriers and restrictions on foreign investment begun selling off 
stateowned companies and is applying wageandprice controls 
on feb 4 the government plans to renegotiate about half of its

floridas black widow got a 
permanent stay from the state supreme court wednesday less than 20 
hours before she was to die in the electric chair 
the reprieve given to judi buenoano condemned for the fatal 
poisoning of her husband 19 years ago is good for the rest of her 
death warrant the court said it will schedule briefs and arguments 
later this week 
only one woman has been executed in the united states since the 
us supreme court reinstated the death penalty 13 years ago in 
1984 velma barfield died by injection in north carolina for 
poisoning her boyfriend 
ms buenoano nicknamed the black widow by prosecutors was 
under her first death warrant none of the 21 men electrocuted in 
florida since the state reinstated capital punishment have died 
under a first warrant 
it is up to gov bob martinez to decide whether a second warrant 
is signed but he is not expected to act until the state supreme 
court decides whether to grant ms buenoano a second trial 
attorneys for ms buenoano filed a notice of appeal with the 
high court wednesday morning after the orlando judge who sentenced 
her to death in 1985 refused to stay the execution late tuesday 
ms buenoano 46 was sentenced to death for the murder of her 
husband air force sgt james e goodyear soon after he returned 
from service in vietnam

parliaments foreign affairs committee 
approved a bill wednesday calling for a sixmonth extension on the 
may deadline for the united states to dismantle its military 
installations in greece 
under the terms of a defense accord that expired in december 
1988 the united states has until may 21 to remove personnel 
property and materiel from four major bases and several smaller 
installations unless a new agreement is reached 
the proposed new deadline for dismantling the bases is nov 21 
the full parliament will debate the bill on monday state et1 
television said 
representatives of the conservative and socialist parties on the 
standing committee for foreign affairs and defense voted in favor 
of the extension requested by the united states so negotiations on 
a new defense pact could continue 
the communistled coalition of the left and progress the third 
party supporting premier xenophon zolotas administration voted 
against the bill it was passed by a simple majority in the 
50member committee 
the conservatives and socialists hold 276 seats in the 
300member parliament the communists are opposed to the bases but 
have said they would not withdraw from the government if a law is 
passed postponing the bases removal 
the zolotas administration was appointed after inconclusive 
general elections in november 
new elections are slated for april leaving the next government 
to determine the fate of the bases with the united states 
a previous fiveyear defense and economic cooperation accord 
negotiated by the former socialist government and washington 
expired in december 1988 it gave the united states 17 months to 
dismantle the bases if no new accord was reached 
the bases were established in greece in the mid1950s 
after 17 rounds of fruitless negotiations athens and washington 
suspended talks before national elections last june a shortlived 
coalition formed by the conservative and communist parties after 
those elections put the issue on hold 
the socialist government headed by former premier andreas 
papandreou had demanded any new defense accord include guarantees 
of aid in case of aggression by nato ally turkey which the united 
states has been wary of providing 
greece and turkey nearly went to war in march 1987 over disputed 
territorial waters in the aegean sea

purpose for this baby 
diabetic women are more likely than nondiabetic women to give 
birth to babies that are stillborn suffer deformities or weigh 
less said hosptial spokeswoman debbie dalhouse also pregnancy 
puts a great deal of stress on a diabetic woman her insulin level 
may fluctuate widely and she is more likely to suffer

during miss jennings pregnancy she was hospitalized six times 
once for more than two weeks 
when she went into labor jan 16 some amniotic fluid escaped 
and blocked one of her blood vessels resulting in cardiac arrest

another delivered the baby by cesarean section the medical staff 
forced oxygen into the infants lungs for five minutes until the 
baby began breathing on his own 
although miss jenningss heart eventually began beating again 
the new mother lay in a coma suspended between life and death 
doctors didnt give the family much hope

never respond said betty jennings miss jennings mother 
for miss jennings the two days were a nightmare from within 
her motionless body she could feel and hear even see but she 
could not respond 
i could hear everybody talking she said you could hear

did you couldnt respond 
throughout the ordeal nurses would ask miss jennings to show 
some sign of life squeeze a hand raise an eyebrow respond in 
some way inside miss jennings said i was squeezing her hand 
talking to her hollering at her but it wasnt coming out i was 
scared that they were going to bury me alive because i wasnt 
responding the way they wanted me to 
a day after the delivery a nurse came in with her newborn 
billy debbie look heres your little boy miss jennings 
recalled her saying i started crying i thought thats my 
little man 
then came the moment when miss jennings realized how close she 
was to death a cousin a baptist preacher had come in to the 
room and knelt beside the woman to pray with her 
i felt a part of my body leave me miss jennings said it 
was like a shield being over me its like the lord held out his 
arms for me 
but miss jennings fought to stay alive im not a person to 
let go easily she said 
on jan 18 a nurse was telling miss jennings just how beautiful 
billy was as in the past the nurse asked the young woman to 
signal if she could hear this time miss jennings raised her 
eyebrows 
when i saw her i felt such a relief mrs jennings said of

the government said wednesday it will 
allow international relief organizations to airlift food supplies 
to warravaged areas of southern sudan 
information minister ali shummo said the government had 
authorized relief organizations to airlift 5000 tons of food 
donated by the european economic community from nairobi kenya to 
juba the capital of south sudan 
he said the government has also given permission to the 
international committee of the red cross icrc to airlift relief 
supplies to governmentheld juba and areas controlled by the rebel 
sudan peoples liberation army 
the concerned authorities have authorized the icrc to ferry 
reief materials to juba area and even to those areas where the 
rebels are present if it the icrc wanted to do so shummo said 
in a statement distributed by the official sudan news agency 
the government suspended relief flights to south sudan last 
august to guarantee the safety of relief workers after the collapse 
of a ceasefire in fighting between the government and rebel forces 
that took up arms in 1983 to demand greater autonomy and economic 
reforms 
shummo said preparations are underway to move a trainload of 
1500 tons of sorghum from muglad in the south to aweil in the bahr 
al ghazal region 
he said the relief train will operate flying the un flag and 
will distribute part of its supplies at rebelheld areas 
in new york a un official familiar with relief operations in 
south sudan said meanwhile that heightened fighting in the region 
is interrupting attempts to move in supplies that agencies expect 
will be needed by june 
he stressed that famine conditions havent developed there yet 
but relief workers want to have the supplies in place before the 
rainy season which would prevent moving them when they will be 
needed 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said sudan 
could face the same kind of famine situation it encountered in 1987 
and 1988 which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of 
people 
however a spokesman for the us agency for international 
development said workers in sudan had not received reports that 
movement of relief supplies had been interrupted by fighting

dealers

after the indictments were unsealed said the defendants arranged 
for the transfer of honest officers to other assignments as they 
engaged in ripping off drug dealers of cash cocaine and marijuana 
between 1981 and 1987 
they would come into the possession of information about where 
drug dealers were where illegal drugs were and should have 
engaged in proper law enforcement activities lehtinen said 
instead they would steal the drugs engage in what in the 
street might be called a ripoff and subsequently resell those 
drugs he said 
some of the ripoffs were allegedly committed by officers serving 
search warrants and others during traffic stops a list of 39 acts 
mentioned thefts of 415000 cash from a dade county home in late 
1982 25000 cash and 15000 cash

chinese students in exile watched 
wednesdays showdown between president bush and congress over 
legislation concerning their asylum here arguing the bill offers 
extra protection they need 
people here want to make sure they stay here safely said an 
wei a chinese national who works at the chinese student 
information center in newton many students were anxious about the 
prospect of being sent back to china where they faced probable 
political reprisals he said 
the house voted 39025 wednesday to override bushs veto of a 
measure eliminating requirements that chinese students return to 
their homeland before applying for a new us visa the matter now 
moves to the senate where a scheduled thursday vote is expected to 
be a cliffhanger 
pei min xin who was a leader of the prodemocracy protests in 
beijing last spring said he has learned that his name is on a 
blacklist in china 
if he was forced to return he would face life imprisonment or 
execution said pei he said he felt disillusioned by the 
presidents actions regarding china which has included sending two 
advisers there in the past year 
how can the leader of the united states be so accommodating to 
people back in our own country who tried to kill us all off to 
stamp out our legitimate demands for political change said pei 
a harvard university graduate student in government 
by trying to not offend the current regime bush also was 
putting america behind a losing bet he said 
it is unlikely that regime will survive five years from now 
pei said i can predict that 20 years from now people like us 
will be running the chinese government are you going to deal with 
people in power now or the future leaders 
pei holds a visa common to many of the students who fled to the 
united states after the chinese government cracked down on the 
prodemocracy movement in tiananmen square in june under the 
visas requirements bearers must return to china when their visas 
expire and live there for two years before they can apply for a new 
one 
president bush said the bill to eliminate that requirement 
which he vetoed in november was unnecessary because he had signed 
an administrative order allowing chinese students to stay in the 
united states 
bush also said the measure could damage us relations with 
china which has condemned the legislation 
chinese students said the override was crucial because an 
administrative order was not as solid as a law the process of 
revoking an order is easier and could happen at any time if the 
situation changes they said 
people would feel a lot more secure if theyre staying here 
because of a law an said 
even those students who were not a part of the democracy 
movement would come under suspicion in china because of their 
western education said an who came to the united states in 1985 
pei said bush made a mistake of moral and strategic importance 
when he urged lawmakers to sustain his veto and vote against the 
override 
he was disappointed and saddened by the presidents actions pei 
said 
we invest a great deal of hope in the american system of 
government in its ideals in human rights and now we are being 
taught a very cruel and cynical lesson pei said the leaders 
of a great democracy are viewing other interests as more important 
than ideals

defense minister italo luder 
resigned wednesday because president carlos menem sided with the 
army chief of staff in a dispute over whether the general bypassed 
luders authority 
i gave the president my undeclinable resignation the 
73yearold lawyer and career politician told reporters 
humberto romero a former aide to menem who resigned six months 
ago and is an elected member of the national assembly was named 
new defense minister presidential spokesman humberto toledo said 
late wednesday romero will assume office friday toledo said 
analysts said luders resignation was more a reflection of his 
poor standing with menem than of problems within the armed forces 
he was the unsuccessful peronist candidate for president in 1983 
and backed menems opponent in the party primary last year after 
menem won the presidency in may and luder became defense minister 
he was forced to accept gen isidro caceres as army chief instead 
of the general he wanted 
luder never has been close to menem and he has never gotten 
along particularly well with caceres rosendo fraga director of 
a centerright think tank said in an interview 
his departure illustrates the fragility of the alliance menem is 
building for his program of selling moneylosing state companies 
deregulation tax reform and encouraging foreign investment at a 
time of recession high unemployment and doubledigit monthly 
inflation 
four of menems cabinet ministers have quit or been moved to 
other departments in five weeks since the president took office in 
july the central bank has had four presidents and various policies 
on exchange rates the money supply and subsidies to private 
businesses 
trouble began at the defense ministry with a dinner caceres gave 
at an army base for menem new interior minister julio mera 
figueroa and juan yofre chief of the government intelligence 
service 
because he was not invited luder felt he was being bypassed in 
the chain of command 
i was in the city but i was not informed about the dinner 
he said in comments broadcast by radio mitre and caceres failure 
to invite him merits punishment 
neither luder nor menem disclosed the punishment chosen but 
merely the fact of its being ordered by the defense minister would 
have forced caceres to retire 
menem told reporters wednesday i think dr luder did not have 
full knowledge of the facts 
i dont want to hurt the feelings of dr luder but it seems 
to me inappropriate that the president and commander in chief of 
the armed forces learns about such a sanction through the media 
any question involving the military is sensitive in this south 
american country which has suffered six coups since 1930 the 
50000man army is the strongest branch and wields influence on a 
level with the roman catholic church labor and organizations of 
farmers ranchers businessmen and banks 
menems predecessor raul alfonsin of the radical civic union 
had to put down three barracks mutinies that threatened the return 
to democracy that began with his election victory over luder in 
1983 
menem 59 tried for national reconciliation in october by 
pardoning dozens of officers still facing trial for human rights 
abuses in the last dictatorship along with alleged leftist 
subversives and about 200 army rebels 
in recent weeks caceras noted poor military pay an army 
private earns about 42 a month and recommended the release from 
prison of four former commanders of military juntas that ruled 
argentina in 197683 
jorge videla and roberto viola generals who were junta 
presidents were convicted of committing rights abuses during the 
dirty war against leftists in which at least 8960 people 
disappeared and were presumed killed 
menem excluded them from his pardon along with two other 
officers convicted at the same time and mario firmenich the 
montonero guerrilla leader who was convicted of murder and is 
serving 30 years in prison

playwright arthur miller in london for rehearsals 
of his play the price that opens next month accused us 
theater wednesday of being superficial 
contrasting unsubsidized theater in the united states with the 
stateaided british theater miller said american theater has often 
degenerated into a search for titillating ways to fill unsubsidized 
and expensive seats 
theaters in the states are finding it very difficult to 
continue because they feel they have got to constantly excite 
audiences in a most superficial way the 74yearold playwright 
told reporters 
speaking during a break in rehearsals for the price at the 
young vic theater he said standards in british theater could fall 
if subsidies were reduced or stopped 
the issue is a hot topic in britain where prime minister 
margaret thatchers government is accused by critics of starving 
stateaided theaters and other arts of sufficient public funding 
her conservative government favors funding of the arts by private 
business sponsorship 
miller one of americas best known playwrights with works like 
death of a salesman and the crucible said 
in britain the only reason you have not gone up the flue is 
that there are some subsidies for major theaters in many parts of 
the country if that stops or goes down sufficiently you will be 
thrown on to the market and that cannot support theater because 
costs are too high 
he said unsubsidized american seat prices made an evening at the 
theater so expensive that general audiences would not go unless a 
critic said the production was a masterpiece even if the critic 
was wrong 
miller said that meant theater audiences in the united states 
have become a selfserving clique and that the plays appear 
tailored to match the audience 
if the british cease or cut down subsidies you are going to 
lose everything and the first thing will be american tourists who 
come here to london to see subsidized theater and then go home 
and vote against it he said 
referring to czechoslovakias new president former imprisoned 
dissident and playwright vaclav havel miller said the final 
resistance to tyranny is culture it is the writer who cannot give 
up his art who shows the regime for what it is 
by some miracle that is exactly what has happened in 
czechoslovakia where a writer of all things generated the 
resistance with his irreconcilability to the lies the former 
communist system stood on 
havel was named president last month by parliament in prague

prince norodom sihanouk of cambodia said 
wednesday he was quitting again as head of the resistance coalition 
battling cambodias vietnamesebacked government 
the exiled chief of state said his resignation is in protest of 
foreign accusations that he is an accomplice in the communist khmer 
rouges drive to regain power in cambodia disputes with his 
coalition partners caused him to step down several times before 
he said he would stop meeting with most foreign diplomats and 
reporters and would not attend any international conferences on the 
cambodian situation sihanouk said he will run for president if a 
political situation is worked out and general elections are held 
sihanouk a noncommunist has headed a resistance coalition 
that also includes the communist khmer rouge and the noncommunist 
khmer peoples national liberation front 
the khmer rouge which conducted a reign of terror in cambodia 
from 1975 until early 1979 in which 1 million people died when it 
was ousted by vietnam is militarily the strongest of the three 
factions 
the khmer rouge has claimed major battle victories since 
september when vietnam said it pulled the last of its troops from 
cambodia the victories have raised fears the khmer rouge could 
rule again 
sihanouk always had an uneasy relationship with the khmer rouge 
but insisted that the only way to contain the group was to include 
it in any political settlement 
in his statement sihanouk said he would retain the title of 
chief of state of cambodia that he held before being ousted in a 
1970 coup led by the usbacked lon nol he said the lon nol 
government was illegal and thus his old title is still in effect 
he said that after several scheduled appointments over the next 
few weeks he will stop meeting all foreign officials diplomats and 
journalists the exceptions are to be his friends from china 
and north korea the two countries where he lives most of the year 
in his statement sinhanouk said without elaborating that 
certain governments of the free world in addition to 
journalists intellectuals and parliamentarians have decided to 
attack me and accuse me of complicity with the khmer rouge 
he did not defend his alliance with the group 
sihanouk is still widely revered in his homeland and is believed 
to be the one person who could hold the country together 
sihanouk has given qualified support to an australian proposal 
to dismantle both the resistance and the vietnaminstalled 
government and set up an interim un administration to run the 
country and prepare for a general election 
in another development a un official said wednesday that 
khmer rouge guerrillas moved nearly all the refugees from a united 
nationsaided borai camp toward the thaicambodian border closer 
to the fighting 
the communist fighters apparently wanted to prevent un 
officials from transferring them to nearby site k a new camp that 
is safer and has better medical and other services but is not khmer 
rougecontrolled 
only about 200 refugees remained at borai wednesday afternoon 
said patrick van de velde deputy director of the un border 
relief operation after a visit there 
borai originally housed up to 4500 people but threefourths of 
them have been moved toward the border since jan 15 said an aid 
official speaking on condition of anonymity

the food and drug administration threatened 
legal action wednesday against an american heart association food 
labeling program it said could mislead consumers but the heart 
association decided to go ahead with the the program 
the fda said in a letter that the food labeling program could be 
risking regulatory action it said there is a very real 
possibility that the fda would find one or more foods under your 
program to be misbranded meaning they might carry misleading 
labels 
the program known as heartguide is an ambitious effort by the 
heart association to make consumers smarter shoppers by identifying 
products low in saturated fat total fat cholesterol and sodium 
products tested and approved by the association for a fee 
would carry a symbol made up of a red heart and a check mark 
the fda has authority to act only after products go on sale it 
can then require that companies change labels the agency can also 
block the sale of improperly labeled items or seize them said jeff 
nesbit an fda spokesman 
vicki anderson a spokeswoman for heartguide said the program 
scheduled to begin officially monday has been under development 
for three years it has been discussed with the fda throughout the 
past year she said 
we were expecting a letter from the fda but we did not 
anticipate this she said heartguide officials thought the fda 
would take a neutral stance on the program not one where they 
would exercise their regulatory jurisdiction 
the heart association however is proceeding with its launch of 
the program monday weve already talked to the companies 
participating in the program and they are in said another 
heartguide spokeswoman jamy poth 
more than 100 brands of margarine oil crackers and vegetables 
already have been tested and approved they include mazola corn 
oil promise margarine pam cooking sprays melba toast and hanover 
frozen vegetables 
however the next phase of the program in which cereals 
cheese cookies pasta salad dressings and other foods will be 
included has been put on hold while the heart association 
negotiates further with the fda anderson said 
none of the labeled products in the first phase is currently 
available on the shelves anderson said manufacturers had begun 
printing containers with the labels but that products were not yet 
ready for shipment to supermarkets 
we all knew that something was coming from the fda said 
john cady president of the national food processors association 
which has vigorously opposed the program 
what we see here is a realization by the government agencies 
that you have a nonprofit private organization a nonregulated 
organization trying to establish a set of rules and regulations on 
labeling for a fee i think thats wrong 
the makers of mazola products said they had not yet decided how 
to react to the fdas action said gail griffin spokeswoman for 
cpc international of englewood cliffs nj that is the parent 
company of best foods which makes mazola 
the fdas letter was addressed to heart association president 
dr myron l weisfeldt of johns hopkins university in baltimore 
acting commissioner james s benson wrote that the heartguide 
program could increase consumer confusion and hamper any 
comprehensive solution to the food labeling problem 
he invited the heart association instead to join with the fda 
and other groups in our current initiative to develop a 
comprehensive revision of the food label to promote good nutrition 
 
weisfeldt said in a statement on behalf of the 27 million 
aha volunteers across the united states i want to say we are 
deeply disappointed by mr bensons letter particularly since it 
has come just a few days before our program was to begin but he 
said i would like to emphasize that we are not closing down the 
heartguide program 
the program has been controversial from its inception the 
national food processors association has opposed the program on the 
grounds that it charges a hefty fee up to 640000 depending 
upon a products sales and that competitive pressures make it 
difficult for eligible companies to refuse to join 
it also opens the door to similar programs by other groups who 
want to charge money to food processors for getting their 
endorsement said ellen morton a spokeswoman 
the program has also been criticized on the grounds that it 
promotes certain foods instead of promoting the idea of a healthy 
overall diet 
the heart association said its educational program will make 
clear that heartguideapproved foods should be incorporated into a 
diet that is beneficial overall

an industry spokesman said wednesday that 
president bush has decided to suspend belowcost timber sales from 
10 national forests in the fiscal year that will begin oct 1 
barry polsky of the american forest resource alliance which 
includes timber companies sawmills and other enterprises said the 
shutdown will be announced in bushs budget proposals sent to 
congress next week 
a spokewoman for agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who was 
out of town referred the question to agriculture department budget 
director stephen b dewhurst who declined comment 
polsky said the 10 forests in fiscal 1988 harvested 262 million 
board feet of timber and provided about 3000 jobs local 
communities received 598 million as their share of federal 
revenue from the timber sales 
polsky in a telephone interview said that preservationists 
want to stop timber sales of all kinds and have been partially 
successful in limited areas where protected species of animals 
exist 
in some forests they cant find a species to protect so 
theyve gone after forests that sell timber below costs he said 
admittedly polsky added some forests do sell cutrate timber 
but theres no federal rule against that and national forests on 
the average do make money for taxpayers 
but belowcost timber sales are losing practices in specific 
forests so there has been pressure to end the practice he said 
polsky identified 10 national forests which tentatively have 
been earmarked for terminated timber sales

president bush expressed hope wednesday that 
mikhail s gorbachev not only survives but stays strong in the 
face of enormous problems he declined comment on whether the 
soviet leader has gone too far in trying to quell civil strife in 
azerbaijan 
anytime you have a use of force and the loss of life we are 
concerned but i dont believe i can judge that question right 
now said bush of the soviet crackdown on rioting in the largely 
moslem soviet republic 
the president at a news conference also announced support for 
elevating the environmental protection agency to the cabinet 
castigated a sleightofhand plan to cut social security taxes 
and mounted a lastditch effort to prevent an override of his veto 
of a bill protecting chinese students from deportation 
bush conceded it was too late to prevent the house from voting 
to override the veto as it did 39025 late wednesday he rested 
his hopes on the senate in trying to avoid the first override in 10 
vetoes 
weve got a fighting chance bush said wednesday night at a 
state dinner for the president of north yemen 
chief of staff john sununu predicted that the senate vote would 
be close you never know until it happens he said 
earlier wednesday bush argued his case on the china veto to gop 
senators over breakfast at the white house 
later after a meeting there on the epa three republican 
senators john chafee of rhode island john warner of virginia and 
david durenberger of minnesota predicted the senate would sustain 
bushs china veto asked if bush already had the 34 votes needed 
warner said were closing the gap on that question right now 
bush also presided at a fulldress military welcome for the 
president of north yemen ali abdullah saleh and hailed him as a 
man of extraordinary accomplishment at a state dinner 
saleh urged bush to prod israel to give palestinians in the 
occupied territories the right of selfdetermination bush assured 
his guest of americas commitment to security in the middle east 
and to the pursuit of a just and lasting peace 
gorbachev ordered thousands of soviet troops into azerbaijan 
last week to stop antiarmenian rioting and restore order the 
military killed dozens of people saturday in storming the capital 
city of baku after 11 days of violence the official death toll 
stood at 170 
with the strife in azerbaijan and demands for independence from 
the baltic states of lithuania latvia and estonia bush said 
gorbachev is faced with an ethnic problem here and an internal 
problem of enormous dimensions 
bush said he cant make predictions about gorbachevs 
chances of surviving the challenges but added 
i hope he not only survives but stays strong because i think 
it is in our interest that perestroika succeed and go forward 
the united states regards the soviet unions annexation of the 
baltic states a halfcentury ago as illegal and bush said he and 
gorbachev discussed the us position at last months malta summit 
but he said he did not want to finetune all that 
emphasizing instead that what we want to do is to encourage mr 
gorbachevs stand that peaceful change is the order of the day 
bush bristled at the prospect of his veto on the 
chinesestudents bill being overridden 
one of the criticisms that gets to me a little is the idea 
that i dont care about human rights that is absolutely 
ridiculous said the president 
not one student was sent back to china after last junes 
government crackdown on demonstrators he said they were safe 
then and they are safe now and they will be safe in the future 
he attributed the strong sentiment in congress to override the 
veto both to persuasive lobbying by the students and crass 
politics by lawmakers eager to hand him a defeat 
he said china took a gigantic step back last year on human 
rights 
but the onetime china envoy said i think i know enough about 
it that in china you get a couple of steps forward and then 
somebody steps back 
suggesting china may shut the door to future exchanges bush 
said the bill is totally unnecessary the longterm policy 
consequences are potentially great and congress in my view will 
have only itself to blame 
on other topics bush 
called sen daniel patrick moynihans idea of a rollback in the 
social security tax a disguise for increased taxes around the 
corner he called it odd that a republican president is the 
one that is protecting the sanctity of the social security 
benefits 
but bush also said a proposal by conservative house republicans 
to allow workers to shift part of their payroll taxes into private 
retirement accounts has some interesting ingredients and is 
worthy of study 
said he cant confirm reports of deep division within the 
bush family on abortion denying a magazine account that 
disagreement surfaced at a family meeting but stopping short of 
saying there is no such division 
said he wants the epa in his cabinet because of the magnitude 
of environmental problems confronting the united states and the 
world 
offered a polite nothankyou to czechoslovakia president 
vaclav havels offer to have the next bushgorbachev summit in 
prague instead of the united states but bush said i was rather 
moved by the suggestion 
said he had not decided how much aid to help repair the 
wounds in panama from last months us invasion 
said the new budget due monday will include our plan to 
restructure americas defenses in the wake of the dramatic changes 
that are taking place abroad

a police officer was sentenced wednesday to seven 
years in prison for the deaths of two black men in an incident that 
ignited three days of racial violence a year ago 
william lozano 30 was convicted last month on two counts of 
manslaughter for fatally shooting an unarmed black motorcyclist on 
a street in the overtown section sending the vehicle crashing into 
a car and killing the motorcycles passenger 
this court cannot do perfect justice in this case said dade 
circuit judge joseph farina who called the deaths and resultant 
trial a tragic incident 
the colombianborn officer showed little reaction as the judge 
read the sentence but his supporters cheered when farina said the 
officer could remain free on 10000 bond pending appeals 
the jan 16 1989 deaths led to the citys fourth round of 
racial unrest in the 1980s all linked to the killings of blacks by 
white officers in two of those cases acquittals of the policemen 
had sparked racial violence and police braced for renewed rioting 
as lozanos trial neared an end last month but on dec 7 a 
racially mixed jury convicted lozano 
police said the city was quiet after wednesdays sentencing 
everything is good theres no disturbance no nothing said 
police spokesman george law 
after the sentence lozano stared briefly at lead prosecutor 
john hogan but said nothing 
lozano thanked his supporters at a news conference later and 
predicted he would be vindicated through appeal 
my attorney my family and i will continue to fight within the 
system for what is right and at the end i will win he said 
outside the courtroom patricia lloyd sister of slain 
motorcyclist clement lloyd 23 said only i wish it had been 
longer 
ray fauntroy head of the southern christian leadership 
conference here said he was disappointed with the sentence 
blacks get seven years just for stealing a loaf of bread 
fauntroy said this officer was just given a pat on the back 
hell be out in two or three years 
hogan who had recommended a 12year sentence said he was 
satisfied 
its a just sentence he said 
lozano could have faced a punishment of 12 to 17 years under 
state sentencing guidelines 
lozano and his attorneys left by a back door and did not 
immediately speak to waiting reporters but mostly hispanic 
supporters clapped as they filed out of the courtroom 
the convicted officers mother haydee lozano recounted the 
familys struggles in the united states and said her son worked 
from the time he was 9 to help the family 
we are not people to destroy but unite she said through a 
translator leave my son free 
defense attorneys from the beginning bitterly criticized the 
case as an effort to ease racial tensions in miami rather than give 
their client a fair trial 
if officer lozano was black he never would have been charged 
with a crime if the two people on the motorcycle were white he 
never would have been charged with a crime defense attorney mark 
seiden told the judge 
earlier the judge turned aside defense efforts to force a 
retrial dismissing their arguments that the case was replete with 
mistakes 
defense attorney roy black said the judge had unfairly prevented 
the defense from challenging a black union official during jury 
selection and he said the atmosphere of violence surrounding the 
case should have persuaded the judge to move the trial out of tense 
miami 
before the sentencing lloyds mother called for justice for her 
son adina lloyd praised the conduct of the trial and told the 
judge to use his conscience 
but at one point she turned to lozano and said if it was my 
son that did it to him my son would be behind bars now 
lozano shot and killed lloyd as he fled from a police car 
pursuing him for running a stop sign lloyds passenger allan 
blanchard 24 died of injuries suffered when the motorcycle 
crashed 
ellis rubin attorney for blanchards family called the trial a 
turning point for the community 
for too long in dade county florida the black minority has 
felt ignored felt frustrated felt there was no equal justice 
under the law rubin said 
but he said a spark was lit by the lozano verdict telling 
the judge we ask you not to douse that spark of justice 
police spokesman sgt david rivero described the sentence as 
average for someone convicted of manslaughter 
this is a democratic system and we police officers have to 
accept that he said of the sentence

president bush is preparing to propose an aid 
program for panama totaling more than 1 billion to help the 
country recover from recent warfare and long years of corrupt 
military rule us officials said wednesday night 
congressional leaders were briefed on the program wednesday and 
a formal announcement is expected thursday said one official 
asking not to be identified 
a second senior official confirming the amount on condition of 
anonymity cautioned not all of it is new money 
about half the program will be in cash and the remainder in 
credits the first official said 
aside from development aid the program will include loan 
guarantees and programs to encourage investment he said 
the administration hopes that other countries experienced in 
foreign aid including japan and western european countries will 
follow the us lead and make contributions of their own 
damage estimates from the dec 20 us invasion vary widely 
ranging from a few hundred million dollars to 2 billion or more 
the united states already has released 400 million in panamanian 
assets frozen in the united states in earlier efforts to topple the 
regime led by gen manuel antonio noriega ousted in the invasion 
according to the official the proposal will will require a 
supplemental appropriation by the congress for a portion of the 
money but a sizeable percentage will be paid for in cuts from aid 
programs to other countries 
a big chunk will be out of the taxpayers pockets the 
official said predicting a tough fight in finding the money 
he said panama although a small country of about 2 million 
people requires substantial aid because successive military 
governments including noriegas stole a good portion of the 
national treasury 
the 1 billion if approved would make panama one the largest 
recipients of us aid per capita after two years of economic 
sanctions that dealt heavy blows to the economy 
the official disclosed details after president bush told his 
news conference he was determined to try to help repair the 
wounds repair the damage 
i mourn the loss of innocent civilians in panama or anywhere 
else bush said 
bush sidestepped the question of compensation for civilian 
deaths saying he was not sure of all details of the planned aid 
package 
officials have said there was not much sentiment to include 
compensation for the families of the more than 200 civilians 
killed the pentagon estimated 220 civilian deaths possibly 
including some soldiers out of uniform 
panamanian officials have put the toll at 202 while some church 
groups have put the numbers as high as 1000 
asked what he would say to the panamanian survivors bush said 
he would tell them look you lost some panamanian lives 
innocent life was lost and yet 92 percent of the people in panama 
strongly supported the action of the united states isnt that 
significant 
a white house official earlier characterized the aid package as 
very broad covering housing trade and debt panama is in 
arrears on its obligations to international lending institutions 
and its total foreign debt amounts to a heavy 534 million 
the assistance package bush aides are preparing will include 
help for rebuilding homes that were damaged in the dec 20 
invasion and some kind of multilateral effort to help panama 
with its debt said another official spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
earlier this week the white house announced that the overseas 
private investment corp the federal agency that promotes us 
investment abroad will recruit us businesses to undertake 
investment in panama opic will sponsor a tour of panama for 
business leaders in late february 
the white house has said there is no money earmarked for panama 
in the 1991 budget that bush will send to congress on monday any 
supplemental appropriation would apply in the current fiscal year 
vice president dan quayle could take the specifics of the plan 
when he travels to panama this weekend for talks with the new 
government the white house official said 
were going to be discussing their requirements and our 
resources said quayles press secretary david beckwith 
quayle is traveling to panama after attending saturdays 
presidential inauguration in honduras his mission is to urge 
recognition by other governments for the usinstalled panamanian 
government and to try to soothe the anger among latin nations 
caused by the invasion

considered one of the the most important roman 
catholic documents since the reforming 196265 second vatican 
council a proposed new universal catechism now is under review 
by bishops 
theologians and other scholars also are taking a look at it and 
find some serious faults with it as well as some merits 
offered as a comprehensive summation of basic catholic teachings 
on faith and morals its finished version is intended to serve as a 
guide for catechisms in various regions of the world 
its a long document and a lot of both positive and negative 
elements are seen in it said the revthomas j reese after 
reviewing comments from a dozen church scholars 
as coordinator of a symposium on the proposed document jan 
2728 at the woodstock theological center in washington he said 
papers prepared for it indicate a number of difficulties with the 
catechism 
he said shortcomings are seen in its compartmentalizing of 
aspects of faith in its tendency to separate the spiritual from 
the natural in its poor use of the bible and its sexist 
language 
reese a jesuit theologianpolitical scientist and research 
fellow at the center at georgetown university expressed doubts 
that bishops could meet the may 31 deadline set by the vatican for 
their reactions to the 434page draft 
the bishops need a lot more time to examine such an important 
document and to consult with theologians about it in formulating 
their comments he said in an interview 
this is the the most important document to come out since 
vatican ii he said it will set the parameters of how the 
catholic faith is taught in the 21st century 
a bishops committee headed by archbishop oscar lipscomb of 
mobile ala was set up early this month for a preliminary study 
but the bishops dont hold a business meeting until next november 
reese 45 whose 1989 book archbishop describes policies 
and views of the churchs us archbishops has another scheduled 
for publication this fall also by harper amp row on scholarly 
reactions to the proposed catechism 
the long often complex and technically worded document was 
produced by a special bishops commission headed by cardinal 
joseph ratzinger chief of the vaticans doctrinal office 
marked sub secreto under secrecy it was distributed in 
december to the worlds 2500 bishops it first was proposed at a 
world synod of bishops in 1985 by cardinal bernard law of boston 
provisionally entitled catechism for the universal church 
its structure follows a longtime pattern much like the last such 
universal roman catechism issued in 1566 after the council of 
trent 
there are three main sections one on the apostles creed 
another on the churchs seven sacraments and the other on the ten 
commandments followed by an epilogue on prayer 
this treatment in separate compartments make it difficult to 
show the relationships of faith and life reese said the 
structure itself automatically sets up dichotomies between the 
world and faith rather than their being integrated 
he noted that the vatican council emphasizes christianity as 
working in the world rather than withdrawal from it 
he said that the scholarly appraisals say the document reflects 
a separation between the spiritual and the natural the religious 
and the secular vatican ii sought to overcome that dichotomy 
the document frequently uses the word man and men in 
references that apply to all people male and female for example 
some headings read man in search for god god meets man 
the dignity of man 
the sexually exclusivist language is terrible reese said 
this day and age must be much more sensitive 
while the document frequently quotes the bible reese said the 
use of scripture is very poor usually quoted in prooftext 
fashion to defend various doctrines 
it doesnt give the kind of comprehensive treatment that takes 
into consideration the historical context and literary forms he 
said treatment of scripture is very very prevatican ii 
he said the document recognizes ecumenical efforts for church 
unity particularly with the eastern orthodox but certainly 
needs strengthening in references to protestants 
some of the language is confusing and needs to be clarified 
he said it needs to be improved to stress the unity catholics 
have with protestants in baptism and in scriptures 
however he said the document also had positive elements such 
as pointing up obligations for peace justice and preservation of 
the environment and also in dealing with judaism 
the document like vatican ii says jews should not be blamed 
for christs crucifixion 
unlike the old council of trent catechism the new draft 
addresses issues unheard of then such as nuclear and chemical 
warfare surrogate motherhood biogenetic research toxic waste and 
reckless driving

in one form or another the social security 
issue has been giving republicans recurrent headaches for a 
generation its back this time wrapped into a dispute about taxes 
and for all their efforts over the past 25 yearsplus 
successive gop campaigners and administrations have not found a way 
to deal with the subject except by denying that they are going to 
cut anybodys benefits 
this time president bush and his people argue that a tax cut 
proposed by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny would jeopardize 
future benefits they claim to be the real defenders of the system 
but moynihan said in introducing his tax cut bill on tuesday 
that the government is mortgaging future benefits by borrowing away 
the reserves that are supposed to be accumulating to make those 
social security payments 
complex questions usually wind up in simplest terms in an 
electionyear debate and in the case of social security it all 
gets down to protecting benefits now paid to about 39 million 
americans always before that has put republicans on the defensive 
vice president dan quayle thinks it can be turned around this 
year on grounds that the moynihan proposal would threaten future 
benefits 
historically weve been attacked on this and now this is the 
first real opening to show the american people that the republicans 
are not going to fool around with the benefits that people 
expect quayle said in an interview 
cut these taxes the way that moynihan is talking about you 
have to cut benefits at some time and the president and the 
republican party now have an opportunity to show the american 
people once and for all that the republicans are as committed to 
the integrity of this social security trust fund as anybody 
house republican leader bob michel of illinois said the moynihan 
plan could inspire even more drastic threats to the system and 
ultimately bring it down 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the finance committee 
called hearings on the proposal next month but warily sidestepped 
an endorsement saying he first wants to make certain that we 
never have to cut social security benefits for future generations 
this debate is a descendant of an earlier political settlement 
on the issue a nagging problem for president reagan who turned it 
over to a commission which recommended the buildup of reserve funds 
that is at issue now 
moynihan served on that panel but he contends that the 
longterm financing plan it drafted in 1983 is being undermined 
because the government is borrowing against the social security 
trust fund using it for current spending and at the same time 
masking the true size of the federal deficit so he says the 
government should stop imposing the extra tax about 55 billion a 
year 
the administration contends that is a play to force a general 
tax increase to make up the 55 billion a year 
either way the government is going to have to come up with the 
money eventually to pay benefits or to repay the money that is 
being borrowed from the trust fund 
and eventually that means taxes 
democratic congressional leaders arent yet sure whether they 
will sign on with the moynihan plan but they are sure they like 
the issue and the tactics involved 
sen george mitchell of maine the democratic leader said the 
moynihan proposal will complicate bushs effort to cut the capital 
gains tax and could even block it it already has forced the 
administration to come out against an electionyear tax cut for the 
130 million workers who pay social security taxes and the 
employers who match their payments 
the latter point has fractured some administration tax 
alliances for example the us chamber of commerce a staunch 
ally in bushs effort to cut the capital gains tax has endorsed 
the social security tax cut too 
republicans are looking for an alternative with a tax cut 
flavor some including rep newt gingrich of georgia the house 
minority whip want to begin changing social security into a system 
of retirement savings accounts mandatory but eventually private 
the idea is to start making the change by requiring that the amount 
of any social security tax cut be put into such retirement accounts 
thats risky business a suggestion that social security be 
changed into a private voluntary system dug the republicans into 
trouble on the issue more than 25 years ago and theyve been 
trying to dig out ever since barry goldwater the 1964 republican 
presidential nominee suggested voluntary social security that led 
to a simple devastating democratic campaign commercial two hands 
tearing up a social security card 
there have been repeat performances with variations in most 
campaigns since reagan made his political debut in the goldwater 
campaign and signed on to the suggestion that it be made 
voluntary a position he later disowned and denied in his 1976 and 
1980 presidential campaigns reagan said the system was headed for 
eventual bankruptcy unless action was taken to put it on a sound 
financial basis in preparation for increasing benefit loads after 
the turn of the century 
that led to the 1983 commission proposal for increased reserves 
early in his administration reagan tried to restrict some 
ancillary benefits and to delay a cost of living increase in basic 
benefits congress wouldnt buy it and the democrats made it a 
major point of campaign attack sen bob dole of kansas the 
republican leader has said the issue was a major factor in undoing 
gop control of the senate in 1986 
the democrats raised it against bush in the 1988 presidential 
campaign saying he wanted to raid social security to cut the 
budget bush said those were shopworn scare tactics 
shopworn perhaps they also have been shop tested to 
democratic advantage so far

causerelated investing once was considered a 
cockamamie idea concocted by liberal crackpots to make money on 
companies that renounce ties to south africa shun defense 
contracts and dont pollute 
over the past two decades however it has snowballed into a 
multibillion dollar chunk of the investment business and has 
branched into other areas ranging from credit cards to a 
longdistance telephone service 
just the amount of money funneled into what are called socially 
responsible mutual funds has grown so much that the wall street 
establishment hungry for business in a depressed industry has 
started to woo potential clients by touting moneymaking 
opportunities tied to social and environmental concerns 
some staid brokerages for example now offer what they call 
screened investments for clients who dont want to own securities 
in companies that do business with south africas white minority 
government others have established funds investing in companies 
that recycle or make only peacetime products 
i think the traditional people are feeling a little funny 
they laughed they made fun and for 20 years they said this would 
be a flash in the pan said rosalyn will a project director at 
the council on economic priorities a new york group that 
researches social investing i dont think its going to be that 
way 
over the past several years the amount of money channeled into 
socially responsible investment funds has multiplied to more than 
45 billion said the social investment forum a bostonbased 
association that promotes the concept of social investing 
many of these funds have been quite profitable despite 
predictions by some finance professionals that using social 
criteria for screening investments is silly and risky 
it totally deflated that argument said gordon davidson 
executive director of the social investment forum theyre now 
beginning to set up their own social investment funds 
two of the topranked mutual funds in 1989 ranked by lipper 
analytical securities were social funds the parnassus fund earned 
a 4244 percent return and ariel growth fund earned 3997 percent 
one of the pioneers in social funds the pax world fund inc 
formed during the antivietnam war movement in 1970 also ranked 
among the best by lipper last year earning a 2492 percent return 
pax world president luther tyson attributed part of the funds 
success to strict criteria for what types of investments it will 
buy 
we are the only fund that defines so carefully how we dont 
invest in warrelated goods and services tyson said we work 
out a definition that can be monitored 
for example he said pax world wont invest in the 600 largest 
defense department contractors using the pentagons own lists as a 
guide the fund also asks companies to respond to a questionnaire 
about their environmental record before deciding whether to include 
them in its securities portfolio 
most social investment funds stick to basic securities stocks 
governmentbacked bonds or certificates of deposit none are known 
to have ventured into the hazardous arena of futures options and 
highyield junk bonds 
we try to be sane said david schoenwald who runs new 
alternatives an environmental and alternativeenergy mutual fund 
that rose 26 percent last year were not a big enterprise 
nothing fancy were very plain vanilla we buy only american 
stocks no options no hedging when we buy a stock we hope we can 
keep it forever 
tyson said the explosive growth of social funds was part of what 
he called increased interest in basic social values by stockholders 
and other investors who want more control over how their money is 
used 
you see the biggest change in the relationship to the 
environment tyson said that battle has been fought and won 
whenever you see major corporations include in their ads how 
sensitive they are to the environment you know youve got their 
attention 
ms will of the council on economic priorities said so many 
social investment funds have appeared recently that interested 
investors should exercise caution in deciding which to choose 
some of these funds are so new they dont have a track 
record she said its like anything else with people trying 
to get into it just like oat bran 
working assets one of the bestknown social investment funds 
has been so successful that it has sanctioned use of the funds 
name for another business venture aimed at tapping the social 
awareness of consumers 
working assets funding service manages a visa card travel 
agency and a longdistance telephone service a percentage of user 
fees are channeled into fund raising for social and environmental 
nonprofitaction groups ranging from greenpeace to amnesty 
international 
were not out there competing with citicorp and atampt said 
the service president peter barnes the people who use our 
cards our longdistance service our travel service they have a 
broad interest in building a better world they trust us to do the 
screening

take a longrange perspective on america as 
most highly successful investors do and you might develop not just 
a less frantic view of the future but a fatter wallet too 
it will relieve you of worrying over the difficulties of savings 
and loan bailouts the intractable federal deficit the chances of 
recession and the possibilities of a tax cut or a tax increase 
many of the economic worries that concern people at any 
particular time disappear from the scene to be replaced by other 
concerns many of the tax financial and economic maneuvers of 
government offset each other 
you might even argue that discussions of tax increases or 
decreases should barely concern you even though every financial 
adviser in the country will warn you that tax strategies are 
necessary for your financial existence 
the evidence about taxes however is that they seldom really 
shift or that if they do it is for only a very limited time 
taxes were cut sharply in the early 1980s by the end of the decade 
all were offset by increases 
in fact economist h eric heinemann points out that individual 
income taxes last year consumed about 10 percent of personal 
income or about the same as the average of the 45 years since 
world war ii 
this isnt to say that congress shouldnt be watched only that 
watching income tax maneuvers might be to watch the wrong things 
while income tax increases and decreases offset each other social 
security taxes do not 
heinemann points out that since 1985 social security taxes 
averaged 94 percent of personal income up from 29 percent from 
1950 through 1955 while in both periods individual income taxes 
averaged 102 percent 
it may also be unwise to get upset about economic numbers such 
as monthly retail sales unemployment inflation rates and the 
like since increases or decreases in any of these can be revised 
out of existence 30 days later 
the longrange view also permits you to see the economy as the 
cyclical creature that it is and understand that what is down 
today might be up five years from now securities real estate 
interest rates inflation rates 
the economy seldom stays the same instead it rises and falls 
expands and contracts a full cycle often occurring in less than 
five years but even those who know this get caught up in the 
interim excitement 
that excitement accounts for such things as people flocking to 
buy stocks at the top of the market spurred on by tales of higher 
prices to come and real estate developers rushing to build as a 
glut approaches 
at the other extreme are people abandoning the midwest rustbelt 
as it was strengthening into what is now one of the stronger 
economic areas and abandoning real estate in houston when prices 
could only go up as they have 
while the nature of economies is to grow and shrink rather than 
remain the same there is in the united states a very clear 
constant the expansions are larger than the contractions 
proof of this can be found in a comparison of america in 1915 
and 1985 in the intervening time there occurred two highly 
disruptive wars and several lesser ones a destructive depression 
and bouts with runaway inflation 
the following figures come from a joint study by the us bureau 
of the census and the conference board 
in 1915 infant mortality per 1000 births was 99 in 1985 it 
was 11 life expectancy at age 20 was 65 years in the earlier 
period and 76 years in the later one 
homeownership as a percentage of all married couples rose from 
46 percent to 776 percent gross national product measured by the 
same dollar 1985 in each instance rose to 3998 trillion from 
468 billion 
gnp per capita jumped to 16777 from 4660 an index of 
productivity to 490 from 100 average hourly wages of workers in 
manufacturing from 244 to 953 
but in between those years there were many bad times and many 
frantic moments for those who couldnt lift their heads high enough 
to see the bigger picture

fortyone floors above midtown manhattan worlds 
away from his home in the soviet union sven papp walks with ease 
through the paneled corridors of white amp case a bastion of us 
corporate law 
the offices are filled with the fruits of capitalism plush 
carpeting flower arrangements and antique furniture but papp is 
more impressed with the word processors at his modest law practice 
in the estonian capital of tallinn papp types his own documents on 
an oldfashioned typewriter 
but the 27yearold lawyer is learning more than modern 
technology at white amp case where he is part of an american bar 
association program that for the first time has brought soviet 
lawyers into the american legal community 
he hopes his study of freemarket ventures will mean new clients 
at home 
papp is one of 17 soviet attorneys in the midst of seven months 
of visits to law firms law schools corporations prosecutors and 
public defenders 
steven raikin the aba attorney coordinating the program has 
gotten only positive response in monthly reports from the soviet 
lawyers and their hosts 
vladimir zakhvataev of the ukraine worked with federal and 
state public defenders in san diego and spent time in the us 
attorneys office he has impressed everyone with his insightful 
observations about ways to transfer some of what he has observed in 
criminal law and protection of rights raikin said 
tatiana zaharchenko a teacher at kharkov law institute in the 
ukraine has been studying environmental law at the university of 
california berkeley she also toured toxic waste dumps and met 
with officials coming from an area near chernobyl she will be a 
real pioneer in environmental law raikin said 
the desire to contribute to legal reform in the soviet union 
emerged as a common theme in interviews with several participants 
papp wants to establish a cooperative law practice patterned 
after american firms that specializes in representing foreign 
companies in business ventures in the soviet union soviet lawyers 
now may share office space but they dont work together on cases 
its not enough for one attorney to work with a client we need 
teamwork like its done here he said 
in the academic setting of cornell university school of law 
olga djujeva has been studying family law djujeva a moscow state 
university law teacher plans to write a book about us protection 
of childrens rights and to lobby soviet officials to expand 
programs in adoption and foster care 
her most rewarding experience has been volunteer work with 
handicapped and down syndrome children i see these kids and they 
are not miserable at all they are happy in our country 
handicapped kids are in hospitals or at home and nobody sees them 
in nashville tenn valentin blueger is cultivating contacts 
just like any other entertainment lawyer seeking a record deal for 
a client blueger who is working at the law firm farris warfield 
amp kanady which represents the grand ole opry has so far been 
unsuccessful in negotiating a us record contract for a latvian 
rock singer the market is so tough here and the acts are so 
professional i do hope something will come of my efforts 
the sophisticated us music industry cannot be compared to the 
system in the soviet union where there is only one record label 
which doesnt even pay royalties said blueger who hopes to be a 
frontrunner as the industry expands 
up to now there have been much more complicated problems to 
solve before the entertainment business but someone has to 
start he said 
the learning experience for the soviets has gone beyond the 
profession 
papp ruefully admits hes developed a new habit of starting his 
day with two cups of coffee he also speaks like a native when 
asked about his host city its something that you love and hate 
at the same time 
moscow attorney leonid kheifets who has been with the 
washington firm milbank tweed hadley amp mccloy celebrated 
halloween in georgetown where thousands of costumed partygoers 
filled the streets the 36yearold former professional basketball 
player met up with a group of australian rock musicians that night 
and sent pictures of the revelry to his family in the soviet union 
my wife wrote back asking who are those strange people 
surrounding you kheifets said with a laugh his excitement 
about his experience was still evident to be absolutely free and 
independent and to have the opportunity to express oneself as you 
want was amazing 
kheifets also tells of being approached on the street by a 
panhandler his initial reaction was to walk on but he decided to 
ask the man what he wanted what ensued was a discussion about 
ussoviet relations 
we both were very happy he didnt receive any money from us 
we just had a little chat i found that it was right that i 
stopped if we can speak to each other without any anger it works 
every time it works 
kheifets said his theory can be applied to the lawyers program 
and the larger issue of ussoviet relations now they know 17 
soviet lawyers they can trust and under the program every year 
they will know more this is the work for the future to work to 
together you must trust your counterparts

even as venice enjoys a winter hibernation 
that allows the echoes of footsteps to resound in the nearly 
deserted squares the specter of pink floyd refuses to go away 
a summer concert by the british rock group that drew more than 
100000 young people and left the city awash in garbage is a 
recurring nightmare 
it is being used as ammunition in a battle over a bid to make 
venice the site of an international fair in the year 2000 and has 
led officials to bar carnival celebrations from famed st marks 
square 
pink floyd was allowed to perform on a floating stage in the 
venice lagoon in july after the rock group agreed to reduce its 
decibel level to protect the colonnaded square and 9th century 
basilica 
but the trash left behind by the concertgoers and the sight of 
thousands of people sleeping in the streets proved too much for 
many venetians 
st marks said fine arts commissioner margherita asso in 
banning the annual carnival from the massive square was attacked 
by vandals and there wasnt and still isnt sufficient police 
protection 
so carnival will go on in other parts of the city judged less 
fragile it will be inaugurated feb 10 by a procession up the 
grand canal led by a 75footlong floating bottle of italian bubbly 
prelent merrymaking is not the only talk of venice there is 
also the bid put forward by the veneto region to make venice and 
nearby cities the site of expo 2000 
backers include such powerful figures as venetianborn foreign 
minister gianni de michelis who also supported the pink floyd 
concert the socialist official the author of a guide to discos in 
italy had said venice must be open to all forms of culture 
including rock music 
the fair is seen as a way of breathing new life into this city 
of canals and marble palaces whose yearround population has 
dwindled to 80000 from 130000 over the past 25 years exhibitions 
would feature science and culture 
with the proper controls expo 2000 would be the right way to 
bring venice into the new century de michelis said 
those in favor insist the fair could attract new businesses and 
lead to the renovation of housing and neighborhoods that have 
decayed as young people have gone to the mainland in search of jobs 
they have left venice to the summer tourists and to the lament 
of many locals cheap souvenir shops and pizza parlors catering to 
daytrippers with backpacks such tourism has inspired calls for 
daily quotas on the number of visitors 
i am one of those who believe the idea of a fair should be 
examined not just written off said venices cultural 
commissioner fulgenzio livieri sitting in his office looking out 
onto st marks square frequented by almost as many pigeons as 
people this time of the year 
he sees it as an opportunity to attract two industries ideally 
suited to the lagoon city film and fashion 
but livieri admits the pink floyd effect is still running 
strong 
graffiti and posters declaring no to expo have gone up in 
the distinctive narrow lanes near the rialto bridge while someone 
has scrawled de michelis repent on the causeway linking venice 
to mestre on the mainland 
in december a small group of venetians took their protest to 
paris holding up signs outside the offices of the international 
committee that will select the host city the other candidates are 
hanover west germany and toronto canada 
the committee is expected to make its decision in june 
for a city so dependent on outsiders even venetians catering to 
tourists seem to have had their fill and hope venice is kept out of 
the plans 
the newsweekly panorama reported that one study predicts a fair 
would attract more than 100000 people a day during its fourmonth 
run paralyze the city and strain services to the breaking point 
it could be a good thing for the region but one cant have 
venice pay for it said daniela vedaldi owner of the florian 
cafe whose violinists serenade honeymooners from around the world 
venice belongs to the patrimony of the whole country and of 
the world i dont think venice needs this

isnt it rich isnt it rare for stephen 
sondheim far from broadway at britains oldest university this is 
the year to send in the class 
the american composerlyricist has just completed his first week 
as a visiting professor of drama and musical theater at oxford 
saying he isnt so much teaching as conducting a musical on the 
road 
i said when i agreed to take this course on that i would 
only be willing to do so if it was in conjunction with a show of 
mine in rehearsal or production somewhere nearby he said 
this was because songheim does not believe that theater a 
collaborative effort can be properly taught in a classroom 
so on their third meeting his 13 students were off to londons 
royal national theater to see rehearsals of sunday in the park 
with george which is to premiere march 15 
the students had already received librettist james lapines 
original script for the workshop production offbroadway and 
lapines finished script for the pulitzer prizewinning broadway 
show 
on a recent monday sondheim showed them the video of the 
broadway production made for american public television the next 
day they met the shows british director steven pimlott and 
studied a model of tom cairns set 
sondheim has a second show opening this summer on londons west 
end into the woods directed by richard jones and starring 
julia mckenzie 
the remainder of his week was spent on the students who were 
asked to write and present an opening number for a show the 
most important part of a musical piece he said 
the 59yearold sondheim fielded questions at st catherines 
college in his first public event since arriving in oxford jan 13 
to inaugurate an annual professorship in contemporary theater at 
the end of the week he flew home and will be back next month to 
continue the course 
the chair is financed by a 175 million pound 28 million 
endowment from cameron mackintosh the british producer of the 
phantom of the opera miss saigon and the 1987 london debut 
of sondheims follies 
sondheim told the spillover crowd of 250 academics students 
stars and oxford townspeople that he saw his task as encouraging 
young writers 
with mackintoshs help he selected 13 people in december from 
92 applicants for a course he intends to be very narrow in 
focus 
it is about songwriting for the theater not songwriting for 
the airwaves mtv or anything like that he said 
each applicant sent a tape of at least three musical numbers 
sondheim said the successful ones all displayed a feel for the 
theater a musical growth into manhood or womanhood 
he said they constituted a truly heterogeneous group whose 
voices were not alike and whose influences included jazz and 
pop and traditional and folk and cabaret and rodgers and 
hammerstein and me 
the students not exclusively oxford alumni are composers or 
lyricists although they earn their living in such fields as 
publishing pharmaceuticals and screenwriting the 11 men are 
british one of the women is canadian the other australian 
the british have responded admiringly to sondheims appointment 
despite complaints that oxford undergraduates arent more involved 
richard wolffe news editor of the student newspaper cherwell 
called mackintoshs gesture wellmeaning but said that the 
position is kind of irrelevant because we dont have any drama 
courses at the university 
mark steyn wrote in the independent newspaper nobody expects 
the young writers taking tutorials from sondheim suddenly to 
produce a gypsy or company but if the experience teaches 
nothing more than an awareness of the decades of evolution which 
preceded those shows it will have been worthwhile 
the students sounded grateful 
kit heskethharvey 32 a musical lyricist and coscreenwriter 
of the film maurice called the course a godsend 
edward hardy 23 who left oxford in 1988 called sondheim a 
tremendous human being not what youd expect of a great 
maestro

desperate pleas of a family trying to locate a 
runaway child shocking closeups of a drug addict shooting up with 
heroin explicit recreations of a brutal murder 
it is called televisioneverita or truth tv and is 
challenging the fluffy variety show in the ratings on italys 
public and private television networks 
the trend media experts say reflects italians love of 
intrigue and their increasing openness to discuss their private 
lives and problems with others 
these programs are coherent with the italian tradition of a 
very gossipy society said franco ferrarottia a sociologist at 
the university of rome 
they also have signaled a new relationship between state 
television and the italian public which is generally alienated 
from government institutions and bureaucracy 
until recently tv was a major pillar of the establishment 
ferrarotti said in an interview these programs would have been 
considered scandalous even blasphemous the official tv is finally 
moving into the sphere of private italian life 
the explosion of truth tv has improved ratings but also raised 
ethical questions about invasion of privacy and use of dramatic 
reconstructions and anonymous calls 
oreste del buono a tv columnist for the newspaper corriere 
della sera has been a leading critic of the shows saying networks 
are taking too many risks with live broadcasts anonymous callers 
and crime shows that focus on poor people without laywers 
treated like animals 
the shows are also a product of the intense competition between 
the staterun rai network and the three major private stations of 
silvio berlusconi most of the truth tv programs are on rai which 
exploits its monopoly on live broadcasting 
truth tv relies heavily on phone calls from the public adding 
to the drama and immediacy of the broadcast but also creating 
potential risks 
on one recent weekday afternoon actress sandra milo was host on 
a new live talk show lamore e una cosa meravigliosa love 
is a wonderful thing on rai when a woman called in and said 
sandra what are you doing there while your son is seriously 
injured in the hospital 
to the horror of a nationwide audience of some 3 million people 
milo burst into sobs ran off the set and fainted in her dressing 
room the call turned out to be a hoax as her son ciro was 
tracked down at the home of friends 
rai said it would tighten controls on phone calls to live shows 
but some commentators said viewers would no longer trust anonymous 
callers 
this incident signals a critical moment in the history of 
truth television wrote bestselling novelist umberto eco in a 
column in lespresso magazine its certain that from this moment 
the public will become more suspicious and many programs will 
suffer from a crisis of credibility 
that hasnt seemed to be the case so far with the most popular 
of the new genre chi lha visto a show on missing people 
that attracts more than 5 million viewers on sunday nights 
the live threehour rai program uses elaborate recreations 
tracing missing persons lives and last known movements composite 
photos showing how their appearances could have changed interviews 
with their families and calls from viewers around the country who 
may have spotted them 
the inaugural show last year caused a stir when it examined the 
disappearance of a us woman sailor from a military base in 
naples it included a recreation suggesting the woman had been 
murdered after a sexual tryst with two fellow american male 
sailors but hours after the show aired the woman was found alive 
and well in southern italy by a police officer who had watched the 
program she had run off with a moroccan immigrant 
calls from viewers on chi lha visto have helped reunite 
several families but often the missing person has run away on his 
or her own and has no intention of going home on a recent show a 
wife became visibly annoyed as callers repeatedly reported having 
seen her missing husband traveling with a young woman one said he 
saw the couple dancing the tango in a nightclub near naples 
it couldnt be him he doesnt like the tango the wife shot 
back 
lio beghin who conceived the show said in an interview with il 
messaggero newspaper we are well aware that the biggest danger 
is invading the private life of a person and getting into the 
merits of making a free choice to leave ones past behind but 
people also have the right to know the fate of a missing relative 
another popular but controversial live rai program is telefono 
giallo which literally translates as yellow telephone but is 
a play on the word giallo which also means mystery the 
show examines unsolved crimes hoping that anonymous calls will 
help provide clues that can reopen the case 
this show could probably go on for another 1000 years 
ferrarotti joked so many italian crimes are unsolved 
crime is also the main event in programs such as pronto 
polizia a show on the private italia uno channel that follows 
police on emergency calls from raids on drug dens to breakups of 
street fights 
last year guests on io confesso i confess would sit 
in a booth their faces concealed and recount their crimes or 
aberrant behavior and answer questions from psychologists on la 
macchina della verita the truth machine they submitted to 
liedetector tests 
the italian public sometimes complains that tv goes too far 
many italians were shocked when one of berlusconis stations showed 
a young addict injecting himself with heroin on camera many 
protested when rai subjected 8yearold marco fiora to prolonged 
questioning on a live nationwide interview show only a short time 
after the boys release from a 17month kidnapping ordeal 
for years we justly lamented that tv put people to sleep that 
it was a social pacifier corrado augias host of telefono 
giallo told europeo magazine and now that tv tackles problems 
and crime news it almost seems that some want to go back to that 
unglorious past 
but overall italians love affair with tv is stronger than 
ever what other country has 10 national tv magazines on the market 
paytv could be the next wave italys first pay station 
italian network is scheduled to debut feb 28 for the cost of a 
200 descrambler viewers will be able to watch pornographic movies 
after midnight 
tens of thousands of people already have signed up but others 
have threatened to file obscenity charges to keep the station off 
the air

a single student circulated a letter accusing a widely 
respected longtime seminary professor of wrong teaching the 
jarring result was an extensive investigation separately 
interrogating nearly all the professors students about his views 
the drastic inquisitorial process at southern baptist 
theological seminary in louisville ky flagship of the 
denominations ministerial education reflects the mistrust 
pervading the countrys largest protestant body 
if it hadnt been for that strained uneasy atmosphere we 
would never have resorted to this kind of procedure said the 
rev roy l honeycutt the seminarys president 
it was an unusual response because of the particular 
circumstances among southern baptists in which seminaries and 
professors are placed under attack 
a fundamentalist wing has dominated the 148 millionmember 
denomination for 10 years gaining control of trustees of 
seminaries and other institutions and putting pressure on personnel 
to conform to fundamentalist views 
the attack on the christian ethics professor the rev paul d 
simmons was only the latest such episode but the drawnout 
individual questioning of 50 of his students wa 
scrupulous investigative processes its a sick climate a kind of 
religious mccarthyism but we have to be very honest and open in 
terms of what we teach 
simmons 53 who has taught for 20 years at this oldest baptist 
seminary founded in 1864 added the whole issue is part of a 
larger battle over academic freedom and responsibility this 
faculty here is committed to solid academic integrity and we 
wont let this kind of thing erode that commitment 
the rev larry l mcswain dean of the seminarys theology 
school conducted the drawnout quizzing of simmons students 
concluding that the students charges were patently untrue 
considering the suspicions stirred by fundamentalists and the 
wide circulation of the letter among critical people mcswain said 
it was important to determine the facts and set the record 
straight 
in ordinary circumstances a lone students complaint would be 
resolved simply by clarifying consultations but in this case the 
detailed findings were relayed in a conference call to trustees 
who affirmed them 
certain persons are quite distrustful of the educational 
community and it was necessary to demonstrate with hard evidence 
that the charges were not true mcswain said rumors are very 
believable in the context of the southern baptist convention 
the denominations dominant fundamentalist wing insists on a 
literalist view of the bible that it is factually inerrant 
historically scientifically and religiously the fundamentalists 
also demand that personnel adhere to this view 
many other baptists including other fundamentalists stress the 
historic baptist principle of the soul competence of believers 
to interpret the bible as they understand it 
asked if the fundamentalist wing instigated the students 
letter mcswain said we have no evidence that this was so we 
know that others bought stamps for the mailings and he was 
assisted in the process but by whom and to what extent i dont 
know 
he said the current atmosphere tends to discourage creativity 
and innovation 
simmons said that some professors become so cautious out of 
fear of being attacked that they no longer deal as openly with 
issues as they would have otherwise 
this happens especially in smaller seminaries which are are 
more vulnerable some of it has happened here but not a lot he 
said 
leonard the historian said the situation also is disruptive 
to students who may hesitate to talk to each other for fear they 
might be accused

episcopal bishop george reynolds of 
nashville tenn says the old world of clergy domination over 
church life must give way to a servant church of all baptized 
people 
in the old paradigm the ordained clergy are the producers of 
ministry and the laypersons the consumers of ministry he said at 
a diocesan convention it is the paradigm of hierarchy in the 
church and its time is past 
he said the tide of history is forcing christians to seek 
more democratic ways to start churches help poor people and find a 
sense of mission in personal life 
in the new paradigm all baptized people clergy and laity 
alike are the ministers making up the servant church

buried in a mountain meadow on the 
edge of yellowstone national park is a complex of 150footlong 
steel cylinders outfitted with beds food kitchens and water 
systems for 756 people 
the 30 cylinders are the guts of a giant fallout shelter being 
built by the church universal and triumphant a new age religious 
group that moved its international headquarters to this 
southwestern montana ranch in 1986 
church members say the sixacre complex isnt provocative or 
extraordinary merely a precaution against nuclear war or accident 
others see it as a symbol of church chicanery and disregard for the 
areas rural environment 
we believe if you live in a nuclear world you have to come to 
grips with the reality of our time said murray steinman a 
church staffer we feel its the responsible thing to do we feel 
that more people should do it 
theyve never been willing to discuss plans prior to 
construction on anything said richard parks owner of an 
outdoorequipment shop at gardiner and a frequent critic of church 
developments any responsible developer is going to do the 
planning first and then go to the community for approval 
church officials didnt divulge its construction until last 
summer five months after the state completed an extensive 
environmental review of other church developments at the corwin 
springs ranch 
i think i was had basically said steve pilcher chief of 
the water quality bureau which oversaw the review that was 
completed last february 
church spokeswoman erin prophet said that construction began in 
may and that a decision on the site wasnt made until after the 
state review 
i personally think thats a little bit of a crock pilcher 
said you dont decide overnight on a project of this magnitude 
the church has been scrutinized by the media and its neighbors 
since buying the 12500acre royal teton ranch bordering 
yellowstone in 1981 from publisher malcolm forbes it has since 
expanded its holdings in park county to 30000 acres built two 
foodprocessing plants opened a printing plant in livingston and 
sponsored two housing developments for church members near 
emigrant 25 miles north it plans another housing development at 
the ranch 
local officials estimate 2000 church members live in the area 
or 15 percent of the county population 
persistent rumors that the church was stockpiling weapons 
against some armageddon were fueled last year when two members 
pleaded guilty to charges of illegally obtaining a dozen military 
assaultstyle weapons federal agents said they seized a shopping 
list for more firearms church officials have denied the rumors 
and say the two who bought the guns including church vice 
president edward francis were acting without the knowledge or 
approval of the church 
the shelter complex isnt the only churchrelated underground 
construction adherents are building private shelters at emigrant 
county officials counted at least 16 under construction there one 
with a capacity of 170 people a magazine published by church 
members carries advertisements selling space in the shelters with 
prices ranging from 1250 to 6270 a person 
church leader elizabeth clare prophet has preached civil defense 
since the 1970s and warns of economic and nuclear calamity in the 
90s in 1987 she said she received a divine message that the 
nation should develop civil defense and missiledefense systems in 
anticipation of a nuclear confrontation 
the confrontation didnt occur by the predicted date of oct 2 
1989 but followers say her messages are warnings rather than 
predictions 
she has said that it may happen because theres always 
free will says erin prophet mrs prophets daughter the 
americans have free will the soviets have free will but as 
long as the soviets have nuclear weapons and icbms then we think 
we need to have shelters 
the large shelter complex is in a valley where the church holds 
an annual conclave attended by thousands of followers nonmembers 
are not allowed in the area which is considered sacred church 
engineers designed the structure with advice from private firms 
and the federal oak ridge national laboratories most of the work 
has been done by church staff members 
the complex consists of six hshaped configurations each with 
five 150footlong steel cylinders about 13 feet in diameter a 
large central structure lies between two of the hshaped shelters 
church officials say the shelters water and sewage systems are 
exempt from state review because it wont be occupied by more than 
25 people for more than 60 days a year the legal description of a 
public water system 
the government says you would only need to be in the fallout 
shelter for a few weeks in the event of a nuclear catastrophe 
steinman said we dont want to live down there any longer than 
necessary 
critics including yellowstone national park superintendent 
robert barbee scoff at such reasoning and have asked the state to 
reopen its review what does it take to have state officials 
say you cant build an underground city for 750 people without 
the proper permits parks fumed 
pilcher said his office is looking for evidence of deception 
but without it the state cant reopen the case the only thing i 
could do is say to the church i think youre a liar but i dont 
have anything to prove that 
parks and other critics say the construction is indicative of 
the churchs preemptive methods of development in areas illsuited 
for it 
prophet replies that the church has followed the law and doesnt 
need to disclose its plans unless legally required to do so they 
dont really care about the environment she said they care 
about stopping us basically what they want to do is shut us down

it took three years for the totally dolledup chrysler lebaron 
coupe to make the scene but the wait was worth it 
three years ago chrysler corp reworked the outside of its 
popular lebaron coupes for 1990 the company fussed over the 
inside and added new engine choices 
the result is a 1990 lebaron gt coupe that is a capable road 
handler with a habitable interior 
the lebarons new 3liter v6 engine mated with a fourspeed 
automatic transmission in the test car provided both performance 
and fuel economy the engine responded in a sane not riproaring 
fashion yet offered plenty of zip 
and despite the goodsized powerplant the test car delivered a 
decent 21 mpg in combined cityhighway driving lebaron buyers also 
may choose one of three other engines and three other transmissions 
offered this year 
the cars frontdrive design and compact size made the gt coupe 
easy to maneuver even in snowclogged parking lots that bogged 
down larger reardrive cars 
i was impressed too by the stopping capability of this gt 
coupe twice it stopped solidly evenly in the snow behind cars 
making sudden turns 
from inside i could hear the engine and some road noise and i 
felt the road bumps i also was distracted by the amfm cassette 
player that flung cassettes onto the center console when i pushed 
the eject button 
but i appreciated not having to lift items over the car body to 
get them into the flat nicely carpeted trunk true the trunk 
clearance is low meaning tall items must be laid down to fit but 
the test car also had split rear seats that folded down for 
versatility 
chrysler did a good job of upgrading the dashboard the 
instrument panel was relatively uncluttered with needle gauges 
used for the tachometer speedometer and the oil pressure 
temperature fuel and battery indicators 
around the sides of these instruments atop the rounded 
instrument cluster jutting out of the dashboard were the controls 
for lights and wipers they took some getting used to i had to 
reach forward with my right hand and push a lever up to the left to 
turn on the wipers then push an adjacent button to squirt washer 
fluid onto the windshield headlight buttons were similarly 
situated on the left side 
the test cars optional front bucket seats felt fine the back 
seat however would be a tight squeeze for three adults the 
middle persons head would likely hit the sloping roofline and 
legroom was tight with the front seats pushed back 
lebaron gt coupe buyers have a median age of 37 and median 
household income of 50000 chrysler said thirtyfive percent are 
women and 35 percent are single fifty percent have college 
educations 
the gt is one of four lebaron coupe models that start at 
12495 the gt model with its sporty outer styling and other 
standard features has a base price of 15678 competitors include 
the oldsmobile cutlass supreme which starts at 14495 buick 
regal which starts at 15200 and mercury cougar which starts 
around 15800 
lebaron sales totaled more than 38000 last year down 
substantially from 57035 in calendar 1988 chrysler spokespeople 
attributed the slump to the sluggish us market and would not 
project sales or production figures for lebaron in 1990 the 
company also is introducing a lebaron sedan this year 
consumer reports magazine says 1987 model lebaron coupes ranked 
worse than average in owner reports of trouble while the 1988 
models ranked much worse than average chrysler officials said they 
had no comment

maybe just maybe rural development is taking 
on a new profile of jobs roads bridges recreation bus routes 
and all the other things that are supposed to make life better for 
people in the boonies 
maybe just maybe the hoary notion that all rural america needs 
to make it sing again is 5abushel wheat 10 soybeans and 
comparable prices for other crops and livestock is fading 
rural america as agriculture secretary clayton yeutter noted 
last week is comprised of roughly 60 million people in small towns 
and communities including about 5 million on the nations farms 
yeutter at a news conference elaborated on president bushs 
longawaited initiative on rural development no new spending was 
recommended 
but the bush plan did include some old favorites under new 
names an advisory panel called the presidents council on rural 
america state versions of the same kind of committee 
demonstration projects to show people how to carry out rural 
development targeting limited federal budget resources and a 
telphone hotline so people can find out where to go for help 
although yeutter stressed the importance of farmers in 
production agriculture he made it clear it will take much more 
than farm prosperity to get rural communities humming again the 
wealth of 5 million farm people is not enough to trickle down to 
all 
and even though agriculture is the largest single component of 
that economic activity it is by no means the sole component and 
should not be the sole component yeutter said what were 
really saying is that we have to devote time and effort and energy 
and some intelligence to creating ways for rural communities to 
expand their job bases well beyond agriculture 
of course it is not a brand new concept that jobs and not the 
price of wheat are the key to rural development but the facts 
appear to be sinking in faster these days 
bushs directive to get cracking on rural development was 
initiated by the findings and recommendations of the economic 
policy councils working group on rural development of which 
yeutter was chairman the group includes other cabinet and white 
house representatives 
in its report the group outlined the needs of rural america 
citing unemployment rates and how rural areas lag behind the cities 
in so many ways and the report dispelled any notion that 
agriculture is the only sure way to rural prosperity 
agriculture remains the most important industry in rural 
america but now employs relatively few people the report said 
this trend is likely to continue 
other observations 
today only about 9 percent of all rural people work on farms or 
ranches 
less than 19 percent of rural americans now derive their 
livelihoods from activities associated with agriculture 
only 500 of americas 2400 rural counties are now considered 
dependent on agriculture 
any new lifeblood for rural america will be found primarily in 
offfarm employment opportunities especially in industries such as 
tourism retirement living and commercial recreation which all 
serve to bring additional income to rural communities the report 
said 
jobs in town are significant to farmers as well as nonfarmers 
it said although net farm income has improved dramatically more 
than 60 percent of all farm families still rely on some offfarm 
employment to maintain themselves 
while a strong farm economy is essential to rural america a 
strong farm economy is not enough by itself to assure rural 
vitality the report said the farm sectors economic recovery 
since 1986 has not revived overall prosperity in rural communities 
nonfarm jobs are essential 
the answer lies in concentrated selected realistic gungho 
efforts by concerned federal state and local people the bush 
initiative seems to say 
congress will have its say too and that may include some 
sterner directives perhaps with some money attached it could come 
as part of the 1990 farm bill now stewing on the legislative 
burner or it might be a separate law 
meanwhile the bush administration says there are dozens of 
federal programs that can assist in rural development and part of 
the new campaign will be to define and use those to better 
advantage 
that is not good enough for some concerned rural americans who 
may be turning to japan for financial help 
japans governmentowned exportimport bank is considering loans 
to the united states says a recent new york times story from 
tokyo the idea arose after the governors of arkansas louisiana 
and mississippi talked to japanese officials a little more than a 
year ago 
now said the newspaper the bank is giving serious 
consideration to providing what could be billions of dollars of 
subsidized loans to underdeveloped regions in several states 
such loans probably would be used for roads ports or other 
developments that would aid economic growth one bank official told 
the times 
japanese official said the idea was born in september 1988 
when the three governors visited japan and asked for help in 
financing projects that neither their states nor the federal 
government could afford the article said

middleclass drug addiction was good business 
for american hospitals until too many of them figured that out 
clinics hospitals and healthcare companies that jumped to 
capitalize on the highprofit field of residential drug and alcohol 
treatment now frequently find themselves with empty beds while 
public programs for those unable to pay struggle to keep pace with 
demand 
addicts in some parts of the country wait six months or more to 
get into a publicly financed program but about 40 percent of the 
beds in private treatment centers lie empty experts say 
if you can pay you can get treatment if you cannot pay 
youre going to be put on a waiting list in most places said 
bill butynski executive director of the national association of 
state alcohol and drug abuse directors 
this disparity is growing the experts say despite an increase 
in public funds for substanceabuse treatment over the last decade 
and a growing awareness among employers and society in general of 
the need for treatment 
the need for treatment is higher than it has ever been but 
the demand is a little different said mike ford president of 
the national association of addiction treatment providers which 
represents private treatment centers 
treatment options are being dictated increasingly by economics 
as the government employers and insurers try to rein in the 
soaring costs of health care he and many other experts say 
the economic tail is wagging the clinical dog said norman 
hoffmann a clinical psychologist at the ramsey clinic in st paul 
minn and director of the clinics chemical addiction treatment 
outcome registry 
the result is intense scrutiny over the need for residential or 
inpatient treatment which can run upwards of 15000 and an 
increasing reliance on less expensive outpatient programs 
hospitals rushed into the extendedcare livein treatment 
business but many now find they cannot fill their spaces studies 
have shown residential and outpatient treatment to be about 
equally effective and insurance companies have seized on this in 
arguing that more addicts should be channeled into the less 
expensive programs 
but treatment providers say residential treatment typically 
about 28 days is more appropriate for some addicts especially 
those who need to be physically separated from their everyday 
environment to break their dependency 
private residential treatment programs began popping up in the 
mid1970s after medicare began covering livein treatment private 
insurance companies also began including coverage in their packages 
by the early 1980s residential coverage was common practice 
the number of freestanding treatment facilities was growing and 
more hospitals were setting aside beds for drug and alcohol 
treatment 
but in 1983 medicare which often drives medical practices in 
this country because of its huge budget now more than 100 billion 
implemented a program designed to cut hospital costs under this 
program medicare agreed to pay hospitals a specified amount for 
treatment of various disorders and illnesses categorized in 
diagnostic related groups or drgs 
before drgs a hospital could be reimbursed at the same rate for 
all inpatient care whether it applied to a cancer patient 
requiring intense medical supervision or an alcoholic in for 
detoxification and needing less attention 
but under drgs hospitals can no longer get top dollar for 
addiction treatment beds some have begun converting those beds to 
more profitable uses including units for organ transplant and 
cancer patients which need the higher levels of medical staffing 
hospitals provide said ken estes spokesman for the national 
association of addiction treatment providers 
employers and insurers meanwhile are feeling the effects of 
skyrocketing healthcare costs some rising more than 15 percent a 
year 
they began their own efforts to cut back usually by reducing 
coverage and scrutinizing use of benefits now companies and 
insurance companies increasingly are turning to managed care 
in which an outside company reviews claims to determine whether 
treatment was medically necessary 
this leads to decisions on a level of care based not on what a 
patient needs but on economic considerations said ford 
as a result he said private treatment programs have found it 
more difficult to get patients to fill their beds because more 
employers and insurance companies are steering away from 
residential treatment 
though outpatient programs are usually less expensive 
participants sometimes wind up paying more outofpocket for them 
because insurance coverage is generally not as good as for 
inpatient programs 
the treatment industry is struggling to match up with what the 
buyers of services want to pay for and in a nutshell they want it 
very cheap said w james nicol president of comprehensive care 
corp one of the largest providers of residential treatment 
services 
nicol blames many of compcares recent financial troubles it 
reported a 47 million loss for the third quarter of 1989 and 
occupancy rates that have fallen to 46 percent on government and 
business efforts to cut healthcare costs 
his company and others like it are responding to the financial 
austerity by shifting some of their emphasis to outpatient 
programs although historically these have never been as 
profitable he said 
since fiscal 1982 federal block grants to states for alcohol 
drug and mental health services have risen from 429 million to 
765 million in fiscal 1989 this year the total is expected to 
reach 12 billion 
more than 3 billion in federal state and local funds were 
spent on alcohol and drug abuse treatment in 1987 according to 
government data 
in fiscal 1988 the national association of state alcohol and 
drug abuse directors counted 6926 substanceabuse programs that 
received public money a 50 percent increase from fiscal 1984 
federal government data counted 984 private forprofit centers 
in 1987 these data based on a voluntary survey also showed 4503 
private nonprofit programs that year some of which may receive 
public funds and may also be counted in the state directors 
numbers 
few programs are financed and operated solely by the government 
most of the time states use their federal and state dollars to 
contract with private nonprofit centers for treatment services 
these funds also usually require the programs to provide service to 
anyone who needs it regardless of ability to pay 
thats probably the biggest reason for the waiting lists 
said olive jacob an albany nybased consultant on alcohol and 
drug issues 
adding to the problem she said is that the federal government 
and many states prohibit their funds being used for private 
profitmaking programs 
she and others say the problem of waiting lists which is most 
severe in the larger east and west coast cities could be eased if 
the federal and state governments were more flexible in the use of 
their treatment dollars 
ford said that if the government set a price for a treatment 
service offered it to private providers and said take it or 
leave it theyd take it

could come in for an interview said lara when i got here 
they said theyve got a space and its now or never i went into 
this place with the clothes on my back 
lara who was admitted in november was in some senses one of 
the lucky ones he managed to keep calling 
many of the 1500 to 1800 people on waiting lists for los 
angeles countys livein treatment centers disappear before anyone 
can help they sink deeper into their addictions sometimes getting 
arrested even killed because of their craving 
los angeles county four times the size of rhode island and home 
to 87 million people has just 650 treatment beds available 
through 18 publicly financed programs 
only two hospitals in the county offer publicly financed 
detoxification usually the first step in treatment in which an 
addicts body is flushed of drugs 
after detox people in need of livein treatment programs can be 
placed on waiting lists for as long as six months methadone 
clinics and outpatient programs have four to fivemonth waiting 
lists 
we cannot provide treatment on demand its as simple as 
that said irma strantz the countys drug program administrator 
the number of people waiting for treatment far exceeds by 
multiples of two or three the available spaces said maury 
weiner who heads the tarzana treatment center in the san fernando 
valley 
officials at public centers say the situation will only get 
worse they point to a drug problem that shows no signs of abating 
erratic state and federal financing and the difficulties of 
treating an increasing number of addicts who are pregnant or suffer 
aids 
there are people screaming for treatment and its 
heartbreaking that we are not able to provide the treatment for 
them said clyde w oden president and chief executive of the 
watts health foundation 
for somebody seeking public treatment persistence is key 
officials at joint efforts a san pedro outpatient program tell 
people on waiting lists to call twice a day to see if a bed is 
available for detoxification 
when beds open up its up to the addicts to get themselves to 
the hospital for the four to sevenday detox before coming back to 
joint efforts for counseling 
joint efforts executive director pat herrera duran said the 
wait is at least three weeks for detox in which time addicts often 
deplete family funds and rob and assault to sustain a drug habit 
whatever it is theyre doing to get their drugs theyll 
continue to do she said 
while public centers struggle privately operated treatment 
facilities have beds to spare at prices as high as 1000 a day 
for treatment only the rich or those with good insurance can 
afford it 
in pasadena a few miles from the impact center the summit 
share unit at st luke medical center has occupants for just 10 of 
its 20 beds for a monthlong program that costs about 11000 
summit sponsors drug and alcohol awareness seminars as part of its 
marketing campaign 
its a real tragedy said diane cullen community relations 
director at summit 
i get lots of people calling from pay phones on the street 
needing methadone but who dont have insurance we cant take 
them as cold as it sounds this is a forprofit organization

investors are still concerned about exxon 
corps sullied image after two oilpolluting incidents in less 
than a year analysts say 
after a bad 1989 following the disastrous march spill off the 
alaskan coast the nations largest oil company began the year with 
a jan 2 pipeline rupture that left 567000 gallons of heating oil 
floating in the arthur kill waterway between new york city and new 
jersey 
the latest spill has resulted in new lawsuits and accusations 
against the oil giant on top of more than 150 other suits stemming 
from the alaska spill the state of new jersey is one of the 
plaintiffs over the latest pollution which exxon officials at 
first blamed on a faulty leakdetection system 
what happened in new yorknew jersey further blackened the 
eye said frank p knuettel oil industry analyst for 
prudentialbache securities inc 
exxons stock lagged behind the overall industrys performance 
last year after the alaska spill remaining relatively flat at 
about 45 in comparison stocks of mobil corp and chevron corp 
had gains of about 20 percent during that period 
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange tuesday 
exxon stock closed up 12 cents at 4712 a share 
the total financial impact of the arthur kill spill is unknown 
exxon has offered to pay for environmental studies and damages 
associated with the leak 
cleanup of the alaska spill which resulted when an exxon tanker 
ran aground in prince william sound has cost exxon 19 billion so 
far according to a us transportation department estimate 
exxon officials acknowledge only over 1 billion in cleanup 
costs with about a third of that covered by insurance exxon took 
an 850 million charge against second quarter earnings to cover its 
estimated outofpocket expenses for the spill the worst in the 
nations history 
analysts say exxons fourthquarter earnings expected to be 
released this week should be in line with the overall industry 
showing lower refining marketing and chemicals earnings and higher 
results in the exploration and production sector due largely to 
higher crude oil prices 
but exxon could decide to take a reserve against earnings for 
environmental costs associated with the most recent spill as well 
as future environmental programs said paul ting analyst with 
oppenheimer amp co 
it wouldnt be anything as big as that for the valdez spill 
but it could affect earnings ting said 
next mondays criminal trial of joseph hazelwood captain of 
the supertanker exxon valdez at the time of its march 24 spill 
also could bring exxon more negative publicity 
exxon has played down the financial and social impact of both 
the alaska and new yorknew jersey incidents but analysts say 
exxons tarnished image and the possibility of damages not covered 
by insurance has made a difference to investors 
william l randol analyst for first boston corp wrote in his 
letter to investors late last year investors have quite rightly 
avoided this stock not because of the actual cleanup costs 
involved but because of the unquantifiable financial threat of 
billions of dollars of potential punitive damage awards stemming 
from the 150 or so lawsuits filed against the company 
randol said tuesday he has upgraded his investment opinion of 
exxon to a buy from a hold while the potential magnitude 
of the lawsuits is significant on the other hand exxon may end 
up paying pennies on the dollar he said 
randol also said exxons stock represents good value in the long 
term 
other analysts disagreed 
i think oil stocks are going to do better not in the very 
near term but exxon will not be in the vanguard of that 
movement said knuettel whose investment firm continues to rate 
exxon stock a hold

moodys investors service inc has lowered its 
credit rating for 12 billion in merrill lynch amp co longterm debt 
because of doubts over the impact of the firms 470 million charge 
for restructuring costs 
merrill objected to the downgrading saying the broad but costly 
restructuring that includes layoffs and sales of some of business 
would improve profitability in 1990 
the lower credit rating is expected to increase merrills cost 
of doing business borrowers with lower credit ratings must pay 
higher interest rates and financial companies rely on borrowed 
money to conduct much of their business 
in many of the businesses in which they operate profit 
margins are already quite thin so its not going to help during a 
difficult period of time said john keefe a securities industry 
analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
merrill on monday said it was taking a 470 million pretax 
charge against fourthquarter earnings to cover severance payments 
writedowns of existing assets and office sales and lease payments 
the charge gave merrill losses of 362 million in the 
fourthquarter and 213 million for the year it was the first 
annual loss since 1971 for the nations largest securities firm 
moodys said it downgraded merrills senior domestic debt and 
european debt to a rating of a2 from its highest rating of a1 
other longterm debt also was lowered 
the credit rating agency said merrills restructuring which is 
expected to include 3000 job cuts this year should reduce the 
firms overhead in the future 
but moodys said it was concerned that merrills prospective 
returns will be pressured due to the presence of considerable 
overcapacity in the securities industry in both the institutional 
and retail sectors 
moodys also said the firms credit standing was supported by 
strong retail and institutional franchises and an acceptable 
level of riskadjusted capital 
we disagree with moodys action because we are confident that 
our restructuring program will respond effectively to the adverse 
industry environmental factors moodys cited as a justification for 
its action merrill said in a statement 
the a1 rating that we held reflected the many financial 
strengths enjoyed by merrill lynch the firm said we believe 
our restructuring program will further enhance that financial 
position and lead to significantly improved profitability in 1990 
and beyond 
shearson lehman hutton inc the secondlargest wall street 
firm late last year avoided a downgrading being considered by 
moodys by enacting a recapitalization plan designed to raise about 
900 million

a federal judge told eddie antar whose 
crazy eddie inc electronics chain collapsed amid fraud charges to 
bring 52 million back to us shores 
the securities and exchange commission alleges the sum is part 
of more than 60 million antar gained by selling crazy eddie stock 
at prices falsely inflated by illegal bookkeeping 
us district judge nicholas h politan said tuesday that antar 
was at the head of a scheme to overstate the companys income 
from 1985 to 1987 and benefited from a higher stock price in 
selling his shares 
the judge stressed that his finding was limited only to a motion 
filed by the sec in its insidertrading lawsuit against antar and 
was not a criminal finding the motion was to bar antar from 
violating securities laws which politan granted 
the judge said he based his finding only on the record before 
him which included legal briefs and testimony by company 
officials antar did not submit a statement 
the public deserves protection from persons against whom 
strong prima facie showings have been made of securities fraud 
said politan 
he also granted the governments request to require antar to 
repatriate 52 million that he allegedly had transferred in 1987 to 
bank accounts in israel the money is to be placed under the 
supervision of a trustee the government has said antar transferred 
as much as 68 million overseas 
the sec wants the money on hand in case it wins an 
insidertrading case and a restitution order against antar 
it would be a compounding of a fraud to permit mr antar free 
reign over 60 million politan said 
antar who was raised in the new york borough of brooklyn built 
his single store there into a 43outlet chain known through the new 
york area for its loudmouthed advertisements touting insane 
prices 
the sec accused him and other former top management of insider 
trading and doctoring the companys books the company went into 
involuntary bankruptcy in october 
antar and former officials also face a shareholders lawsuit in 
federal court in brooklyn and a criminal investigation by the us 
attorney here 
sec attorney richard simpson said an indictment if returned 
would not come for another three months 
politan put the sec civil case on hold for the next four months 
antars lawyers asked for the stay because they were unsure if the 
us attorney would seek forfeiture of antars legal fees 
under the federal racketeering law the government can try to 
seize legal fees if they represent illegally gotten funds 
antars lawyers argued that it was unfair for one branch of 
government the justice department to seek lawyers fees in a 
criminal case possibly depriving antar of legal defense against a 
civil lawsuit from another arm of the government the sec 
the stay prevents the sec from interviewing antar and his 
codefendants under oath

federated department stores and allied stores 
corp have asked a us bankruptcy judge to let them restore 
benefits for 100000 employees and draw on 700 million in credits 
to help them through chapter 11 protection 
carol sanger a cincinnati spokeswoman for allied and federated 
said the companies hope for quick approval of three motions at a 
hearing thursday before bankruptcy judge j vincent aug jr 
most of this is housekeeping stuff ms sanger said 
the two retail divisions of federated stores inc filed the 
motions seeking approval to restore employee benefits authorize 
700 million in credit lines from two new york city banks and 
resume normal credit operations at allied 
us trustee conrad j morgenstern who is helping steer 
federated and allied through chapter 11 proceedings said the 
requests appear valid 
the company wants to continue to have support and the goodwill 
of its employees including those that are retired morgenstern 
said we think it is appropriate and customary for a company such 
as this to ask for this authority 
the benefits for some 100000 employees nationwide include 
health and education plans disability insurance workers 
compensation bonuses drug and alcohol abuse programs and 401k 
retirement plans 
the retailers also want permission to reinstate the 20 percent 
discounts given to retirees morgenstern supported that proposal 
because it would generate additional sales for the companies he 
said 
we hope judge aug is sympathetic with the argument said 
mark cohen chairman of the cincinnatibased lazarus store chain 
we have a lot of retirees and we value their tenure we believe 
it should be restored 
federated and allied the american retailing divisions of 
torontobased campeau corp filed chapter 11 reorganization 
petitions jan 15 in cincinnati to obtain court protection from 
creditors the cincinnatibased companies that operate nine 
department store chains listed 75 billion in debts 
under the chapter 11 proceedings the companies must obtain the 
approval of a us bankruptcy court to pay operating expenses and 
other bills 
morgensterns office is assigned to assist the courts and his 
staff will attend thursdays hearing along with lawyers for 
federated allied and their creditors 
federated and allied formally asked aug to authorize 700 
million in cash reserves from new york city banks chemical bank 
has offered a 300 million credit line known as 
debtorinpossession financing to allied and citibank has 
offered a 400 million line of credit to federated 
another filing asks approval for normal credit operations at 
allieds stores 
this simply allows the systems in place to continue 
functioning ms sanger said this allows the companies to fund 
ongoing operations on a normal basis without any delays 
morgenstern said he thinks aug may give approval thursday for 
the employee benefits but may take longer to approve the financing 
requests

high on a shelf in christie hefners office 
almost lost amid the stainless steel gleam of playboy enterprises 
incs new headquarters sits a battered old manual typewriter 
the machine the same model as the one on which hugh hefner 
produced the first issue of playboy magazine in 1953 is a link to 
the past of a company that is looking excitedly toward the future 
its a reminder of our roots and a connection to the 
beginning ms hefner said tuesday as the chicagobased 
publishingandvideo company celebrated its move with a posh party 
at the new offices 
even as weve changed the company and were moving into new 
markets at the heart of everything is still the same commitment to 
quality and entertainment weve always stood for she said 
hugh hefner wasnt at the invitationonly bash 
at 63 the onetime king of the swinging singles is working on 
his autobiography and settled in his los angeles mansion with 
pregnant wife and former centerfold kimberley conrad 26 
he still owns about 70 percent of the stock but daughter 
christie playboys chairman since november 1988 has run the 
company daytoday for about eight years 
several playmates were on hand at the party but the only bunny 
in sight was a bronze sculpture of playboys rabbithead trademark 
by chicagoan richard hunt one of many artworks on display in the 
new offices 
playboy bunnies disappeared with the last of the companys us 
key clubs in 1988 but playboy has saved some of the cottontailed 
costumes along with other icons of its hedonistic heyday 
joining those relics in storage next month will be the 
9foothigh playboy sign atop the companys former skyscraper 
headquarters on chicagos michigan avenue 
the new digs are slightly smaller but the workspace is airier 
and provides better opportunities for displaying works from the 
companys 4000piece modern art collection ms hefner said 
the new offices are on the top two floors of a 16story downtown 
building fronting on lake michigan less than three blocks from the 
36story tower that housed the corporate offices for more than 22 
years 
playboy says the move will save it 11 million over the 15year 
term of the lease 
ms hefner said the new headquarters make a symbolic statement 
about this company being renewed reenergized and entering another 
era of creativity 
playboy is indeed showing renewed vigor 37 years after hefner 
launched the companys fleshandfashion flagship magazine from his 
kitchen table in chicago with a 600 investment 
although playboy magazines circulation is nowhere near its 1972 
peak of 72 million it has held at roughly 35 million for almost 
five years while sales of hardercore mens magazines such as 
penthouse and hustler have continued to fall 
under the direction of ms hefner 37 who became president in 
1982 playboy has made a successful push into home video retooled 
its broadcast television operations increased product licensing 
and expanded its publishing business into art prints and catalogs 
ever watchful for new markets playboy moved quickly to exploit 
the democratization of eastern europe with a hungarian edition of 
playboy magazine that sold out its 95000copy printing 
a second hungarian issue is on the stands 
the company blamed restructuring costs for a 38 million net 
loss in the fiscal year that ended june 30 after two profitable 
years 
playboy reported a 5 million profit on revenues of 393 
million in the first quarter of its new fiscal year and some 
analysts see growth in playboys future 
they have an awful lot on their plate and the potential here 
is quite significant said analyst david leibowitz of american

more than onethird of the nations 
companies plan to hire more middlelevel managers during the first 
six months of 1990 according to a private survey 
its definitely good news said nancy kovalcheck director 
of advertising and public relations for management recruiters 
international inc which conducted the survey it has never 
looked better for middle management and business 
in fact if anything theres going to be a crisis in the 
1990s in finding people to fill these positions because the 
unemployment rate right now for middle managers is only 19 
percent she said were creating more jobs than can be 
filled 
according to the survey issued tuesday only 118 percent of the 
2700 executives who responded to the management recruiters poll 
said their companies planned cutbacks during the first half of 1990 
another 516 percent told pollsters their companies would 
maintain the same middle management workforce and 362 percent 
said they would hire middle managers during the first six months of 
1990 
the telephone survey has a margin of error of 05 percent

wall street is turning into mean street for the 
nations big brokerages and even leaner regional firms are 
struggling to cope with an exodus of small investors since the 1987 
stock market crash 
a slumping stock market declining corporate takeover activity 
and faltering junk bonds point to a continuing industry shakeout 
that analysts say will mean more cuts in businesses and jobs 
the trend was dramatized by merrill lynch amp cos stunning 
announcement monday that it would spend 470 million to pay for 
such cutbacks 
outside new york regional brokerages are retrenching a 
190point stock market drop in october and steady declines this 
year havent helped prospects for an industry still trying to 
rebuild the trust of small investors following the 1987 crash 
many brokers are offering new services such as managing the 
assets of wealthy individuals or small companies in order to stay 
afloat some regional firms have been swallowed up or are imperiled 
rauscher pierce refsnes inc a dallasbased brokerage has 
trimmed its retail force to 270 brokers from a peak of 350 most 
of those who departed simply were not making it in a tough 
market sim trotter rauscher pierces senior vice president for 
marketing said tuesday 
advest inc last fall acquired newhard cook amp co of st 
louis dain bosworth inc in late 1988 acquired the 100broker 
milwaukee co and the 112yearold bc christopher securities co 
of kansas city is suffering because of the retail industry 
slowdown analysts said 
still the regional firms continue to outperform their 
fullservice wall street brethren which expanded dramatically in 
the gogo days of the mid1980s 
according to the securities industry association national firms 
reported profits of 106 million in the first nine months of 1989 
compared to losses of 682 million for all of 1988 and 193 
million in 1987 
regional firms had 165 million in profits for the ninemonth 
period compared to 107 million in 1988 and 273 million in 1987 
although we are not insulated from many of the problems 
affecting national brokerage firms we have a modest and more 
disciplined cost structure said charles hayssen chief 
financial officer of minneapolisbased piper jaffray amp hopwood 
inc which on tuesday reported an almost 50 percent surge in 
commission revenue 
regional firms avoided many of the problems of wall streets 
giants because they have low overhead and their businesses often 
are limited to stockbrokering and other basic investment services 
socalled fullline firms engage in a wide range of 
activities and many houses have relied for profits on huge fees 
from investment banking services such as arranging mergers and 
takeovers which are on the decline 
industry analyst perrin long of lipper analytical services 
predicted brokerage firms 1989 fourthquarter profits would fall 
40 percent to 50 percent from the third quarter to about 240 
million from 471 million 
in 1990 he predicted earnings of the more than 350 new york 
stock exchange member firms doing public business would drop as 
much as 15 percent 
and thats if the environment doesnt get any better long 
said at the rate were going the environment is going to get 
worse 
merrill lynchs record fourthquarter charge gave the nations 
largest brokerage its first annual loss since 1971 merrill which 
analysts considered bloated by overexpansion plans to reduce its 
staff by about 3000 by yearend 
overall industry employment has shrunk by more than 35000 jobs 
since before the crash sia figures show 
i dont think its over said lawrence eckenfelder of 
prudential bache securities corp in san francisco who expects 
cuts to continue for 12 to 18 months 
analysts say costs remain too high for national firms such as 
merrill or shearson lehman hutton inc partly because of new york 
real estate prices high salaries and broad expansion during the 
boom years shearson on tuesday reported slender fourthquarter 
earnings of 38 million compared to a 13 million loss a year 
earlier 
wall street is the most expensive place in the world to do 
business except tokyo said donald f howard deputy chairman of 
the consulting firm gray judson amp howard of cambridge mass 
were no longer in a high margin business 
with the exception of merrill wall street firms generally are 
reporting higher profits and revenue for 1989 however financial 
statements indicate much of the gains are from interest and 
commissions also 1988 was a weak year for the industry

the us court of appeals has overturned a verdict 
that might have cost the polaroid corp 30 million in payments to 
shareholders in a case involving the failure of polavision an 
instant movie system 
the threejudge court cited errors by the trial judge including 
incorrect instructions to the jury in overturning the 1987 verdict 
in a suit by investor irving backman boston attorney thomas 
shapiro argued that polaroid founder edwin land and company 
executive julius silver sold stock in 1979 knowing that polaroid 
stock was high at the time because of the undisclosed failure of 
polavision technology 
polavision was a 68 million failure and was withdrawn from the 
market in 1979 
land and silver settled with backman out of court but in july 
1987 a jury found polaroid liable for damages to shareholders 
equal to 975 a share 
a polaroid spokesman said tuesday the company had not seen the 
ruling and could not comment the boston globe said shapiro was out 
of town and neither he nor land who is retired could be reached 
for comment

congress budget experts said today that 
lawmakers and president bush will need to find 74 billion in 
savings to meet next years deficit target 
the estimate by the congressional budget office made to the 
senate budget committee is more than double the amount the 
administration is expected to say it needs in savings 
it also continues a long tradition of disagreeing deficit 
forecasts between the two branches 
bush submits his fiscal 1991 budget to congress on monday he is 
expected to say 30 billion to 35 billion in new revenues and 
spending cuts are needed to meet the 64 billion deficit target 
mandated by the grammrudman balancedbudget law 
the report by cbo congress fiscal analysis arm projects a 
138 billion deficit for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 unless 
savings are found bush is expected to ask for 123 trillion in 
spending for next year 
the cbo report contains even more bad news for the future 
grammrudman requires declining deficits every year until 1993 
when the budget is required to be balanced 
but according to cbo deficits are projected to be 135 billion 
in 1992 and 141 billion in 1993 declining slowly over the next 
two years 
without spending cuts or tax increases the deficit in 1993 is 
likely to be no lower than in 1990 cbo director robert d 
reischauer told senators 
the huge difference between the cbo projections and the 
administrations numbers are due to differing expectations about 
economic performance 
the white house office of management and budget is expected to 
forecast that the economy will expand this year by about 26 
percent measured from the fourth quarter of last year through the 
third quarter of 1990 cbos projection is 18 percent 
as a rule of thumb every 1 percentage point in economic growth 
adds 25 billion to federal revenue collections because a 
healthier economy means more robust tax collections 
fiftyone private economists surveyed by blue chip economic 
indicators a private publication have projected that the economy 
will expand by an average of 17 percent this year that would be 
the slowest us economic growth since 1982 
by law the administrations shortfall forecast is binding 
leaving the cbo figures little more than advisory but the 
projections by the nonpartisan cbo are considered by many 
lawmakers and budget observers to be more reliable than those from 
the white house 
under grammrudman automatic spending cuts are triggered in 
most federal programs should congress and the president fail to 
agree to savings that meet the deficit target that happened last 
fall but a compromise between bush and congress was enacted that 
will lift the cuts early next month 
the deficit targets set by grammrudman however apply only to 
the coming fiscal year the law sets no penalties if the actual 
deficit ends up exceeding the legal target an eventuality that has 
occurred every year since grammrudman was enacted in 1985 
meanwhile the treasury department announced tuesday that the 
budget deficit grew by 1464 billion in december bringing the 
total shortfall for the first three months of the 1990 fiscal year 
to 6969 billion 
that is more than twothirds the 100 billion deficit that 
grammrudman permits for the entire year and compared with a 6758 
billion deficit for the first quarter of fiscal 1989

mazda motor co and ford motor co plan a joint 
venture to produce compact cars in europe based on existing mazda 
models a mazda official said 
japans fourthlargest automaker and its us partner expect to 
produce the cars in saarlouis in southwestern west germany said a 
mazda official who spoke on condition of anonymity he declined to 
say whether the venture would build a new factory or use an 
existing ford plant 
wed thought about belgium england spain and west germany 
and west germany seems to be the best he said 
mazda and ford will produce cars similar to two existing mazda 
models familia and capella the official said 
japanese automakers currently dont have any factories on the 
european continent although nissan began producing small cars in 
britain in 1986 and toyota and honda plan to begin producing cars 
in britain in 1992 
west germany is an important place in many ways it has a lot 
of knowhow in technology and designs that we can learn for 
instance the mazda official said 
mazda and ford have a long partnership in finance and 
technology and ford owns more than a 23 percent of mazdas stock 
local media reported mazda and ford are to produce 120000 cars 
beginning in 1992 with each company selling 60000 cars each 
mazda reportedly is to invest some 50 million yen in the project 
bert serre director of international public affairs at ford in 
michigan said he couldnt confirm the reports 
nothing has been agreed on we have had discussion with mazda 
they are partners of ours he said nothing has been 
finalized 
the mazda official said the two sides are negotiating details of 
the plan the amount of investment could be smaller than reported 
and production also may not come as early as 1992 he said 
since our exports to europe are still growing wed like to 
decide on the amount of local production in west germany so that it 
will not harm the exports the official said 
in 1989 mazda exported 288475 cars to europe including 
familia and capella according to mazda 
nihon keizai shimbun an economic newspaper said the american 
and japanese automakers chose west germany because it is the best 
place to obtain access to the eastern bloc which is seen as a big 
market in the future following the recent democratization movements 
there 
the venture would make mazda among the first japanese automakers 
to gain a manufacturing presence on the european continent ford 
already is one of the biggest automakers in the european market 
suzuki motor co japans largest minicar producer announced 
jan 9 that it has reached an agreement with hungary to set up a

santa fe pacific corp plans to reduce employment 
on its railroad by 2700 jobs over five years officials of the 
company say 
the reductions would take place through job buyouts attrition 
and possible layoffs and would affect both union and whitecollar 
workers said robert gerht spokesman for chicagobased santa fe 
the cuts would likely affect santa fe railway across its 
11500mile system officials said 
there is no specific timetable for the cuts which would reduce 
employment with the railroad from the current 18000 to about 
15300 according to the company 
some buyouts will be voluntary and some wont gerht said 
this is part of an overall plan to make the railroad more 
efficient and competitive 
in a statement issued tuesday santa fe pacific corp parent 
company of the railroad said it lost 2094 million or 133 a 
share in the fourth quarter because of a charge taken to establish 
reserves for covering costs of the workforce reduction and other 
railway restructurings the pretax charge totaled 3896 million 
the quarterly loss compared with net income of 1561 million 
or 99 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 1988 reflecting a 
136 million gain on the sale of a portion of the companys 
pipeline operations 
the railway actually had an excellent quarter to finish out 
1989 said robert krebs chairman and president of santa fe 
pacific if not for the charge he said the railway would have 
reported a 40 percent increase in operating income 
santa fe railway reported fourthquarter operating income of 67 
million before the restructuring costs up from 477 million a 
year earlier 
for the year santa fe pacific reported net income of 146 
million or 9 cents a share compared with a net loss of 465 
million or 30 cents a share in 1988 
the santa fe railway has been steadily reducing employment for 
several years about three years ago it took 85 crew members to 
run a santa fe train from chicago to los angeles the railroad 
currently uses 40 crew members on the same run and company 
officials expect to cut that number to about 30 gehrt said 
company officials said that the proposed union job cuts are 
provided for in recently negotiated labor contracts with some units 
of the united transportation union and the brotherhood of 
locomotive engineers the railroad is negotiating to reach similar 
agreements with other bargaining units officials said

a top regulator told congress today that 
president bushs 50 billion bailout of the savings and loan 
industry is probably too low 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp and chairman of the new bailout agency the resolution trust 
corp said the money provided in legislation last august would be 
adequate only if the government seized no more than an additional 
40 billion worth of sampls 
as of jan 16 the rtc had seized 333 institutions with assets 
totaling 136 billion the loss on those is about 42 billion he 
said 
however the treasury departments office of thrift supervision 
is predicting that another 225 to 295 institutions with assets of 
160 billion to 200 billion will fail 
we have found no reason to question the reasonableness of 
those estimates seidman told the house banking committee 
the likely size of the loss 50 billion as provided by the 
sampl bill is probably too low a figure he said 
however he added it is very difficult to provide a more 
definitive number and said under any scenario the 50 billion 
should as far as losses are concerned carry the rtc into 
1991 
seidman went a step beyond testimony on tuesday from deputy 
treasury secretary john e robson who said i cant tell you 
with certainty that the 50 billion is going to be enough 
on tuesday robson said the thrift office was compiling a new 
watch list of weak sampls which may indicate resolution costs 
beyond the original estimates 
robson was representing an administration oversight board which 
controls the purse strings and policy of the bailout also 
appearing were oversight board members alan greenspan chairman of 
the federal reserve board and jack kemp secretary of housing 
in other sampl developments tuesday 
the house committee subpoenaed financier michael milken to 
testify in its investigation of the role of junk bonds in the 
collapse of charles h keating jrs lincoln savings and loan 
association of irvine calif and other thrifts a spokesman for 
milken declined comment 
the former junk bond trading chief for drexel burnham lambert 
inc is expected to stand trial later this year on securities fraud 
charges in april 1988 he invoked his constitutional protection 
against selfincrimination to avoid testifying to congress 
also subpoenaed were ernest garcia and fernando acosta arizona 
businessmen involved in land deals with lincoln 
the government sold 5 billion in 40year bonds to finance its 
bailout of the savings and loan industry the first time in 35 
years it has sold paper of more than 30 years maturity the bonds 
issued by the resolution funding corp sold at an average yield of 
86 percent with tuesdays sale the government has now raised 
295 billion to finance the cleanup 
the office of thrift supervision penalized a fifth officer of 
the failed silverado banking savings and loan association denver 
but it postponed for up to 10 days a decision on neil bush the 
presidents son who had served as a director of the failed thrift 
russell m murray former executive vice president of silverado 
agreed to an order prohibiting him from working for a federally 
insured financial institution without advance permission from 
regulators 
the thrift office suspended trading of stock in centrust 
savings bank of miami floridas largest sampl regulators levied the 
oneweek suspension after accusing the thrift of filing misleading 
and inaccurate financial reports analysts say the thrift which 
invested deposits in an expensive art collection is close to being 
seized by regulators 
private analysts and some members of congress have been saying 
for months that the 50 billion will amount to little more than a 
down payment on the cost of resolving the nations worst financial 
problem since the depression

in its first purchase of western 
commercial aircraft the soviet airline aeroflot has ordered five 
airbus a310300 widebodied jets airbus industrie said wednesday 
officials of airbus a western european aircraft manufacturing 
consortium declined to disclose the value of the order aircraft 
industry sources said the contract is worth abut 310 million 
airbus managing director jean pierson said the aeroflot order 
represents the new kind of relations between eastern europe and 
western europe 
stateowned aeroflot also has taken an option to buy five 
additional airbus jets airbus officials said each plane can carry 
195 passengers 
the planes will be delivered between november 1991 and june 1992 
and will be used for aeroflots flights between the soviet union 
and the far east europe and north america 
alexander aksenov the soviet unions civil aviation vice 
minister told reporters in toulouse that aeroflot is holding talks 
with western european airlines on a maintenance contract for the 
new jets 
a full maintenance base in the soviet union would be 
uneconomical for such a small number of planes he said 
aeroflot must still choose between general electric or pratt and 
whitney engines to power the aircraft 
airbus already has sold jets to two eastern european airlines 
east germanys interflug has taken delivery of three a310300s and 
has another three on order while the czech airline ceskoslovenske

the owner of a denver printing company surrenders the keys of 
his twobedroom condominum to a lender because the units net value 
is far less than the balance of a second mortgage 
a government employee in florida worries he wont have enough 
money after lowering the selling price on his house to repay a 
homeequity loan plus put a down payment on new property 
the slumped housing market not only is erasing homeseller 
profits its beginning to put a damper on the 111 billion 
industry for homeequity loans and lines of credit which only a 
few years ago ballooned into one of the nations most popular forms 
of borrowing 
peddled by bankers eager to lend money these loans have been 
used by homeowners to finance everything from vacations to college 
for the kids backed by the properties themselves as collateral 
they are especially popular because the interest generally is 
deductible under the 1986 tax reform which is phasing out the 
deductibility of other consumer loans the rates also are much 
lower compared with personal loans 
borrowing against the house remains a convenient way to tap into 
one of the nations greatest pools of wealth an estimated 45 
trillion in homeowner equity but eroding housing prices in many 
parts of the country have reduced some of that equity limiting 
homeowners borrowing power and leaving some past borrowers with 
more loan than equity experts say 
as a result some banks thrifts and other lenders have 
tightened their credit policies and at least one expert predicts a 
significant number may start to flee the homeequity business this 
year 
i think more people will be looking at their homes as shelter 
than as an investment said a gary shilling head a new york 
economics firm that bears his name they thought they had this 
neverending appreciating asset that they could tap but its not 
ken k a denver printer who preferred not to reveal his last 
name for publication found that out the hard way 
he said he recently returned to a lender the twobedroom condo 
bought as an investment five years ago after the balance on a 
second loan came due since the condos market value had fallen to 
around 30000 from the 52500 purchase price he realized that 
even by selling the condo he couldnt come up with the 9000 
needed to repay the lender 
the situation isnt quite as grim for a florida government 
official who also wished to remain anonymous however he is 
concerned that by consistently lowering the 200000 asking price 
of his home therell be little left to put a deposit on another 
house and repay a 25000 homeequity credit line 
despite these types of problems many financial institutions 
remain optimistic about homeequity loans noting that defaults 
remain relatively rare and prudent credit policies should forestall 
serious defaults 
the american bankers association said that in 1988 the last 
year for which complete data was available losses from home equity 
loan defaults among all commercial banks totaled 220 million 
thats considered negligible compared with the billions in 
potentially bad third world loans for example 
some delinquency rates however have risen at the end of the 
third quarter of last year 093 percent of all openend credit 
lines were delinquent or at least 30 days past due up from 086 
percent the same time in 1988 aba figures show the delinquency 
rate on closedend loans was 169 percent in the third quarter 
down from 176 percent it said 
an open or revolving line of credit lets borrowers set aside 
an amount of money to be used when needed a closedend loan or 
second mortgage provides a fixed dollar amount 
a softer realestate market coupled with a rise in delinquency 
rates has prompted many lenders to emphasize borrowers ability to 
repay rather than a homes appraised value 
a home equity loan is more a personal loan than a real estate 
loan said paul fritts director of the division of supervision 
at the federal deposit insurance corp unless you have good solid 
equity together with a good work record i think it will be more 
difficult to get those loans 
fritts said some banks that may have taken a chance on 
homeowners who were considered riskier than average when housing 
values rose are rejecting their loan applications now 
a few bankers said privately that theyve started restricting 
home equity credit lines and loans mainly to homeowners on which 
they hold the primary mortgage or to longstanding customers with 
reputable credit histories 
banks also are less likely to lend beyond their standard credit 
limits which typically run to about 80 percent of the available 
equity in a home fritts said when housing values were firmer a 
few banks extended credit to as much as 90 percent he said 
at connecticut national bank in hartford the maximum credit 
limit was trimmed several weeks ago partly because we saw that 
the new england real estate market was starting to soften said 
donald grigley whos in charge of the banks installment finance 
businesses he said that although losses from defaults remain low 
the bank had noticed a slight increase in late payments 
frequent late payments will prompt lenders to review a loan 
contract and borrowers credit record and in some cases to order 
a reappraisal of the property used as collateral 
however as long as borrowers pay on time they have little to 
worry about even if the balance exceeds the equity in their home 
because of declining real estate prices experts say 
still paul havemann a vice president at butler njbased hsh 
associates which publishes mortgage market information predicts 
the housing slump will help prompt some lenders to stop offering 
homeequity credit altogether this year 
havemann said he already has seen some signs of a pullout its 
harder to find lenders in the home equity business for his monthly 
survey of rates

interior secretary manual lujan in a bid to 
end a decadeold battle with environmental groups agreed today to 
create a new computer system to make it easier for the government 
to suspend coal mining permits issued to past violators of the 1977 
strip mining law 
interior department officials said the agreement signals a new 
and more cooperative approach to the concerns of environmentalists 
on the part of president bush and his administration 
in the exchange for the dropping of a law suit lujan agreed to 
a detailed work plan to improve the computerized applicant 
violator system maintained by the departments office of surface 
mining 
the system has been widely regarded as a failure 
our aim is fair evenhanded enforcement of the surface mining 
law lujan said in a statement this new agreement underscores 
our willingness to cooperate with citizen groups and the congress 
in seeing that the law is enforced consistently and effectively 
at the same time lujan said this settlement does not go 
beyond the laws requirements or compromise coal mine operators 
entitlement to due process of the law 
the agreement worked out in intense negotiating sessions 
beginning last september is aimed at creating a computer system 
that will accurately match previous violators of the law with 
applicants for new coal mining permits 
brent rushforth an attorney for save our cumberland mountains 
a principal plaintiff in the case told reporters this agreement 
goes further than ever before to assure that the information is 
accurate and that permits issued to violators can be suspended 
it doesnt go beyond the law it implements the law 
rushforth said 
filed in 1980 the suit arose out of the conviction of many 
residents of the coal mining regions of appalachia that strip 
mining laws were going unenforced 
an initial settlement was reached in 1981 after a court order 
directed the interior department to install a computer system to 
match past violators with new coal mining applicants 
critics complained some strip mine operators found to have 
violated the law simply changed the name of their companies and 
applied for a new permit at another location 
many such operators were failing to comply with requirements 
that the land be restored after the mining was completed the 
critics said 
installation of the computer system did not end complaints 
environmentalists contended the system proved wholly ineffective 
in preventing the issuance of new permits to past violators 
early last year the save our cumberland mountains organization 
sought to have a judge hold the interior department in contempt of 
court for allegedly failing to comply with the earlier court order 
that it strictly enforce the surface mining law

u s west inc reported an increase in 
fourthquarter earnings wednesday but said profit for the regional 
phone company dropped slightly for all of 1989 
we ended the year on a very positive note financially and as 
a whole said jack macallister chairman and chief executive 
officer our business is more exciting than its ever been 
were truly becoming a global communications company 
in the fourth quarter which ended dec 31 u s west reported 
net income of 3444 million or 184 a share compared with the 
1988 fourthquarter net income of 2717 million or 149 per 
share 
fourthquarter revenue totaled 25 billion compared with 
revenue of 23 billion in 1988s fourth quarter 
the results for the 1989 quarter were due to increased revenue 
from local phone operations longdistance service cellular and 
paging operations and the companys directory publishing operation 
the company said it also said it benefitted from a property sale 
and a change in accounting for income taxes 
for the year the companys net income totaled 111 billion or 
602 a share compared with 113 billion or 617 per share in 
1988 
revenue for 1989 totaled 97 billion up from 92 billion in 
1988 
the 1988 results include a nonrecurring aftertax gain of 887 
million or 4tials unlimited inc of grand rapids which claims 
to be the biggest and midwest research inc of walled lake a 
detroit suburb 
the industrys premise is that we can recognize information 
presented below our threshold of awareness even though the 
listener hears only soothing music or the sound of ocean waves on 
an audio cassette or sees images of nature on a video the 
subconscious mind can detect the hundreds or thousands of 
speededup underlying subliminal suggestions manufacturers say 
mind communication offers about 300 titles by direct mail 
ranging from weight loss and improving sex two of the biggest 
sellers to controlling spending habits and becoming a better 
bowler there are tapes designed for children to build selfesteem 
or stop bedwetting 
subliminals have been raising eyebrows since the 1950s when it 
was reported that by flashing eat popcorn during a movie 
theatergoers rushed for the concession stand unaware they had been 
subliminally persuaded 
in recent years it appears millions of consumers have brushed 
aside the diabolic connotations associated with mind control and 
comparisons to big brother while they plunk down 10 to 40 for 
what manufacturers market as a shortcut for solving problems and 
breaking bad habits 
the 60minute tapes most of which provide a script of their 
messages are prominently displayed near selfhelp books in 
national bookstore chains such publishing companies as simon amp 
schuster random house and bantam books recently have devised their 
own versions 
many respected researchers accept the validity of subliminal 
perception but claim there is no proof that these selfhelp tapes 
work 
theyre a waste of time and money said howard shevrin a 
university of michigan psychologist whos been involved in 
subliminal research for more than 30 years shevrin said even if 
there was a behavioral change in some people it would be impossible 
to trace it to the tapes 
shevrin suggests the possibility of harmful side effects in some 
people a theory with which tuthill agrees 
theoretically they could be harmful with forced prolonged 
exposure tuthill said if the message is noxious or contrary 
to what you want people have actually developed some bizarre 
symptoms 
tuthill said he has seen a smoker develop headaches and heart 
palpitations when exposed to a stopsmoking tape the symptoms 
stopped when the person stopped listening to the music tuthill 
even puts warning labels on his weight loss tapes because of 
reports from pediatricians that children inadvertently exposed to 
the tapes were losing weight 
barrie konicov owner of the 14yearold potentials unlimited 
has among his 200 titles bust enlargement and birth control if 
you create a thought that you will not get pregnant you will not 
get pregnant is one message 
a 1981 raid by the us food and drug administration forced 
konicov to soften his medical claims he stands by his tapes 1 
million to 2 million copies of which sell each year worldwide in 
such bookstore chains as b dalton waldenbooks and barnes amp noble 
look its a 10 tape he said adding that the company 
offers a moneyback guarantee nobody questions what we do 
though the field is largely unregulated the texas attorney 
generals office confirmed it is investigating claims made by 
several such companies 
the use of such tapes by retailers to cut shoplifting or by 
employers to increase production of unsuspecting employees has 
raised ethical questions tuthills biggest customers are 
retailers but he said he has turned down requests from auto 
dealers and political candidates 
while many of the companies cite selfconducted studies little 
independent research has been done in the area of selfhelp 
subliminals most of the companies point to individual testimonials 
as proof of their effectiveness 
two canadian psychology professors who have done independent 
research call the tapes a health fraud 
timothy moore of york universitys glendon college in toronto 
said some of the tapes he has studied apparently contain no hidden 
message at all 
philip merikle of the university of waterloo in ontario said an 
analysis of tapes made by several companies found there is no 
identifiable signal on them that could penetrate the subconscious 
he likened the amazing success stories to placebos 
weve known for hundreds of years that effective treatments 
are ones that people believe are going to work he said but 
subliminal tapes he concluded are clearly health fraud 
its not inconceivable that 20 to 30 percent of these people 
could report real improvement but not for the reasons used by the 
manufacturers he said but if 25 percent of the people who 
listen to these tapes stop smoking thats great thats also the 
irony of it

phyllis pelts workday is consumed by the grim 
realities of the ghetto the evicted family the girl who goes 
hungry the boy whose mother was murdered its part of life as a 
school nurse 
only minutes and miles away chuck ruders day on the 51st floor 
of the sleek sears tower is devoted to the fast pace and steady 
pressures of retail and finance its part of life in the fortune 
500 
little children and big business rich and poor two worlds 
seemingly destined to remain apart instead theyve united in an 
experiment in which corporate americas money muscle and 
management are being used to develop a desperately needed product 
academic success in the inner city 
the corporatecommunity schools of america is a tuitionfree 
academy created guided and financed by united airlines baxter 
international sears quaker oats mcdonalds and other 
chicagoarea powerhouses that donate dollars and sense to matters 
ranging from purchasing to personnel 
we must manage our schools as we manage our major corporations 
with accountability responsibility skilled talented paid 
people said school founder joe kellman if there was a profit 
motive is there any doubt ibm general motors and sears roebuck 
would be in the school business 
if you try to run major city school systems with volunteers 
that have no skill get no money and have no time then you get 
what youve got bankrupt systems he said 
big city education is a billiondollar business kellman says 
so who better to oversee it than experienced executives such as 
ruder from sears hes among seven corporate board members eight 
others are area residents or educators 
such partnerships arent new americas corporations have poured 
millions into education programs ranging from adoptaschool 
systems to guaranteed jobs organizers say this is different 
theyre supporting and assisting were building said bud 
kraus assistant to the chairman and chief executive officer at 
baxter a medical and hospital supply company 
the 1yearold private academy in predominantly black 
lawndale one of chicagos poorest neighborhoods is designed to be 
a lab to find ways to teach innercity children then duplicate the 
process in urban areas nationwide 
were looking to influence change in the system not educate 
300 kids kraus said 
the schools small size and independence set it apart unlike 
urban systems there are no powerful unions no tangled 
bureaucracies no crumbling buildings teachers salaries are 10 
percent to 15 percent higher 
as far as duplicating this in chicago i cant see how you can 
do it with prevailing resources said robert saddler deputy 
school superintendent and a board member of the corporate school 
still he said i dont think you have to replicate it on a 
mass scale to gain from it 
chicagos schools are doing their own experimenting with a 
reform plan establishing local councils in each of some 600 
schools giving parents major decisionmaking powers 
kellman thinks success will be limited considering 68 percent 
of chicagos 409000 public school students live in poverty the 
underclass will never manage their schools he said theyre 
having trouble managing their lives 
kellman concedes hes no educator he quit school after eighth 
grade to join his fathers glass business and now runs the 100 
million corporation 
but the 70yearold philanthropist knows business and hes 
devoted to lawndale his childhood home today its in trouble 
more than half lawndales residents get public aid more than a 
third of the housing is substandard recent studies found a murder 
rate six times the national average infant mortality almost three 
times as great 
if you walk into a typical class and ask a group of children 
how many know someone whos been shot hit by a car in jail 
or been killed virtually all the hands go up said primus 
mootry the schools project director who grew up in the area 
despite such brutal surroundings educators hope to prove these 
children can learn as well as those raised in affluence 
we do not accept any of the stereotypes that might travel 
with the neighborhood the school is situated in said teacher 
kathy irwin we do not put numbers on their heads in terms of iq 
some say there are social or biological limits we reject that 
the example were setting is that educating children in the 
inner city is not only possible but the children deserve it 
said principal elaine mosley 
to smooth the way the school has taken special steps 
classes for example are held yearround to minimize exposure 
to street life the building is open from 7 am to 7 pm to 
accommodate working parents preschool takes children as young as 
2 and high school equivalency degree programs are offered 
each room has a teacher and an aide there are no grades and 
children up to age 9 are grouped in twoyear clusters an idea that 
appeals to elaine finley whose two sons and daughter are pupils 
theyre learning at their own speed public school would 
have pushed them aside she said theyre active participants 
in learning in public school they would sit back behind a desk all 
day 
mrs pelt cuts red tape working with dozens of social service 
agencies she weighs children helps them get eyeglasses makes 
dental appointments supplies gloves accompanies parents to doctor 
visits and even allows them to do their laundry at the school 
the role of the school is everything that needs to be done to 
enhance learning she said 
money helps more than 28 million has been invested mostly by 
55 corporations providing annual contributions ranging up to 
150000 
the 5200 annual perpupil cost compared with 4624 in 
chicago will drop as enrollment increases from the current 200 to 
the 300 maximum kraus said all pupils are chosen by lottery 
businesses also provide resources sears for example donated 
carpeting air conditioners and cabinets but just as vital is 
whitecollar wisdom 
there are parts of the school that are much like a business 
personnel practice and policies for instance said ruder sears 
vice president of corporate public affairs 
still there are skeptics 
business leaders dont have the magic answer to education 
problems said don moore director of designs for change a group 
involved in chicagos school reform im just as content to see 
the manager of a store or a bus driver or a policeman on one of 
these councils he said 
moore also wonders how long are these corporations willing to 
put up this much money the history of these kinds of efforts 
is they fall on hard times after awhile 
school officials say its too early to gauge success but 
kellman predicts that at the end of three years pupils test 
scores will be better than their public school counterparts 
mootry said the school already has helped by bringing movers and 
shakers to lawndale 
they see the families he said they realize its not just 
a bunch of poor drugcrazed underclass folks but people struggling 
to make their lives better its drawing attention to the plight of 
the community its bringing some hope

a defense contractor reimbursed executives 
who attended a 500aplate fundraiser for alexander haigs 
presidential campaign in 1987 the companys founder said in court 
documents 
corporations cannot legally contribute directly or indirectly to 
presidential campaigns 
james guerin founder of international signal amp control corp 
made the allegation in a deposition filed tuesday in an employment 
dispute with his former chief attorney the dinner raised some 
26000 for haig 
the deposition said the former chief attorney william a clark 
had told guerin and other top isc officials he felt the 
contributions were illegal the deposition said 
guerin in his sworn testimony gave no further details about 
the alleged reimbursements 
there was no indication in the documents that haig secretary of 
state under president reagan white house chief of staff under 
presidents nixon and ford and former nato supreme commander was 
aware of the alleged arrangement between isc and its executives 
i can certainly say that we are shocked and surprised and know 
absolutely nothing about what was alleged woody goldberg a 
spokesman for haig said from washington today we wouldnt know 
and certainly have no knowledge about this whatsoever 
goldberg said haig was out of town and could not be reached 
news reports at the time of the dinner quoted an isc spokesman 
as saying the company had a keen interest in haig and felt his 
presidency would benefit the company 
a year earlier haig had worked as a consultant to isc and 
helped negotiate a deal to sell missiles to the pakistani 
government of the late gen mohammed zia ulhaq guerin said 
guerin later sold isc to the londonbased ferranti international 
plc for 670 million in ferranti stock 
in the employment dispute clark claimed guerin paid him only 1 
million of a promised 275 million settlement ending clarks 
fiveyear association with guerin guerin countered that clark used 
coercion and extortion to secure the agreement

competitive in the international marketplace 
a sale by the government tuesday of 40year bonds to finance a 
rescue plan for troubled thrift institutions drew a very chilly 
reception from investors 
as the outlook for interest rates has worsened investors have 
begun to face the possibility that the recent slowdown of the 
economy might deepen in the months ahead 
brokers also said a weak attempt by stocks to rally on tuesday 
left many traders unimpressed and disheartened 
todays drop opened up some room for bargain hunters who helped 
bring prices off their early lows but blue chip issues were the 
main beneficiaries of the buying spurt 
comeback stocks included merck up at 72rsqb general electric 
up rsqb at 63lsqb and atampt up to 41

ford motor co ltd workers voted by nearly 32 to 
accept a 102 percent pay increase averting a nationwide strike 
union leaders said wednesday 
final returns showed that 59 percent of those voting went 
against their union leaders recommendation and accepted the 
improved offer they will get a 102 percent raise in the first 
year and a minimum of 8 percent or a choice of 25 percent above 
inflation in the second year 
the vote took place tuesday and wednesday 
most of the 32000 workers at the us companys 22 british 
plants earn an average of 374 a week 
union leaders rejected the offer last week and sought agreement 
from the workers to start striking with the last shift on friday 
the ford pay negotiations are considered a bellwether for 
britains manufacturing industry 
a higher settlement there would have encouraged other pay 
demands further undermining prime minister margaret thatchers 
battle to cut britains high inflation rate of nearly 8 percent 
as it is the ford deal is likely to mean more doubledigit pay 
demands the engineering union the biggest in the country 
immediately announced it considered 102 percent a benchmark 
for raises throughout industry 
a spokesman for the ford unions who wasnt identified in 
accordance with british practice said members accepted the 
proposal because it was quite a good offer 
it was always our aim to get our members a pay settlement in 
double figures and that we did he added 
a ford spokesman said the acceptance vote has saved us the 
prospect of a potentially damaging strike here and at fords 
continental european plants 
workers at ford plants near london and liverpool among the 
largest sites voted only narrowly to accept the offer it was 
rejected at two major engine plants in south wales 
unofficial strikes at some plants are possible including at 
halewood near liverpool in northwestern england where 550 workers 
in their second week of an unofficial strike may stay out to 
protest the settlement

the new york mercantile exchange and commodity 
exchange inc said wednesday they were exploring a merger of the 
two markets a combination that analysts said could give the comex 
the most immediate rewards 
the two commodities markets announced they were pursuing merger 
negotiations and would form a joint board that would govern any 
consolidated company resulting from a merger 
the exchanges which trade a variety of precious metals and 
energy futures said they agreed to form a joint governing board 
after their executive committees met tuesday 
the marketse respective boards instructed their executive 
committees to continue negotiations over the most efficient way to 
consolidate the administration and operations of the exchanges 
analysts said nymex and comex which have been housed in the 
same lower manhattan building since 1933 have discussed merging at 
various times over the last decade 
sharing resources would mean greater efficiency and cost savings 
for both exchanges but particularly for the smaller commodities 
exchange they said 
i see more advantages for comex said evan baron senior 
account executive for elders futures inc its entire trading 
system needs to be overhauled nymex is already more computerized 
and up to the minute 
comex still operates under an antiquated trading system that is 
more vulnerable to fraud he said 
in addition sharing the merc fee revenue appeals to them 
said john azarow vice president and senior energy trader for smith 
barney harris upham amp co 
a marriage of varied products and markets as the much larger 
chicago commodity exchanges have had for years also makes sense 
financially and strategically 
the concept of having diversified products is attractive 
because if one market is quiet another one might be cooking said 
azarow 
while nymex now is the larger more active market that wasnt 
always true at various times in the 1970s and 1980s comex was the 
bigger more active exchange 
comex traded 19 million futures and options contracts last year 
compared with 385 million for nymex 
now is the mercs time in the sun but who knows we could 
have a change in the economic environment and oils could slump 
while the metals markets boom said azarow 
but while current comex volume is down the merc is slowly 
reaching maturation said one analyst who did not want to be 
named except for a proposed new natural gas contract it has 
traded the same products for years he said 
the joint governing body will include a chairman who is a nymex 
member a vice chairman who is a comex member 16 nymex member 
directors eight comex member directors and six public directors 
the exchanges said many of the terms of any consolidation had 
not yet been determined including the extent that either 
exchanges liquid capital reserves woudl be made available to the 
consolidated market 
the two exchanges also said any agreement reached by the 
executive committees and board is subject to membership and 
regulatory approval 
nymex the nations largest energy exchange trades crude oil 
heating oil unleaded gasoline residual fuel oil propane 
platinum and palladium futures 
comex trades gold silver copper and aluminum futures 
a futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a fixed amount 
of a commodity or instrument at a set price on a future date 
both exchanges also trade options in many products options are 
contracts that permit the owner to buy or sell at a fixed price 
until a specific date

slack export demand for the commodities 
the markets had opened slightly lower amid worries about the 
stock markets steep early decline then turned higher as stocks

started said dale gustafson an analyst with drexel burnham 
lambert inc in chicago 
he said export demand for us wheat corn and soybeans had been 
very slow although traders are expecting the agriculture 
department to announce new wheat subsidies for china and the soviet 
union 
at the close of trading wheat futures were 1 cents lower to

lower interest rates and production schedules 
could help make half of the nations financially troubled auto 
dealers profitable by years end according to the incoming 
president of the nations largest dealer group 
the national automobile dealers association which represents 
about 20000 us car and truck dealers has said for the past year 
that about half of its members either were losing money or just 
breaking even 
dealers have slashed vehicle orders from manufacturers trimmed 
advertising spending and shrunk their inventories to cut costs now 
its time for the government and manufacturers to do their part 
nada presidentelect ray green said tuesday 
i think it is a possibility this year we could look for an 
upturn if interest rates would drop to 9 percent and if the 
automakers would cut production to the rate of sales green said 
in a telephone interview from nada headquarters in suburban 
washington dc 
some economists have urged the federal reserve to lower the 
discount rate the interest it charges on loans to banks that in 
turn could encourage declines in openmarket interest rates 
possibly leading to a cut in the prime lending rate charged by 
banks now 10 percent 
banks use the prime for setting lending rates on some car loans 
and on a range of other consumer and business lending 
if the things happen that im talking about it could move 
easily to 75 percent profitable dealers by the end of the year 
said green it doesnt take much per car in expense or profit to 
change that considerably 
outgoing nada president ron tonkin and other organization 
officials blame the tough times for dealers on high interest rates 
and ambitious production schedules which forced manufacturers to 
stick incentives on their new cars to help clear jammed dealer lots 
that limited dealers ability to get a fair return on their 
investment tonkin has said and has shriveled their profits 
green said that on average dealers nationwide are losing money 
on new car sales and trying to make it up with profits from used 
cars service and parts operations 
green who begins his oneyear term as nada president next month 
at the organizations convention in las vegas hsa been a member of 
the nadas board of directors for eight years 
he got into the automotive industry in 1952 when he joined 
general motors acceptance corp as a field representative in des 
moines iowa two years later he became a salesman at a 
chevroletbuickcadillac dealership in iowa city 
green later became a general manager of a dealership in 
monmouth ill a business he bought in 1958 green now runs green 
holding co inc of jacksonville ill which owns four dealerships 
in central illinois holding seven franchises 
if the automobile manufacturers in north america are not 
making money and if the auto dealers are not making money selling 
new cars theres something not working out there green said 
its going to have to be a different arrangement

the stock market suffered another broad setback

about rising interest rates and pressure on the japanese market 
the dow jones industrial average tumbled more than 60 points at

ibm and siemens ag the german electronics 
giant said wednesday they would jointly develop a new generation 
of computer memory chips 
under the agreement the two companies will work on developing a 
64millionbit dynamic random access memory chip or dram 
the largestcapacity chip now on the market holds 4 million bits 
of information that chip was first introduced commercially by 
international business machines corp last year 
ibm and siemens also have independent efforts under way to 
develop 16millionbit chips which would be the next generation 
after the 4millionbit chip 
a bit is the smallest unit of information used by a computer 
because of the way chips are constructed advances in capacity 
usually take place in intervals of four times greater capacity than 
the previous generation 
development of the 64millionbit or 64 megabit chip will take 
place at ibms east fishkill ny semiconductor center and will 
use the resources of ibms essex junction vt facility and 
siemens munich research center the companies said in a statement 
each company will share equally in development costs the 
companies said manufacturing would be done individually by siemens 
and ibm said ibm spokesman paul bergevin 
ibm the worlds largest chip producer uses all the chips it 
makes in its own products it said it has no plans to sell the 
64millionbit chips on the open market 
the goal of the joint venture is to have a worldstandard 
64millionbit dram ready for commercial introduction in the 
mid1990s the companies said 
the strengths of the two firms complement one another and 
increase the probability that world leadership in memory chip 
technology will be maintained the companies said 
the companies did not disclose what they expect to invest in the 
venture bergevin said 
he said the joint venture was proposed to reduce the overall 
costs each firm would have had to bear individually 
he said it will be the first time ibm has jointly developed a 
computer chip although it has joint ventures in other areas for 
example ibm and siemens jointly operate the rolm telephone 
business 
one industry analyst said the announcement is not surprising 
the cost of development runs into the many millions of 
dollars each generation gets to be that much more expensive 
said millard h phelps of the san francisco investment firm 
hambrecht amp quist 
he said siemens which is known for its basic research is not a 
direct competitor of ibm 
as computer chips become more complex and more circuits are 
packed onto the silicon wafers the traditional method of making 
them using photolithography techniques with visible light to etch 
the electronic circuits is no longer practical phelps said 
probably at the 64 megabit level you cant do it that way 
he said and instead may require the use of xrays or electron 
beams for the etching 
theyre really having to break a lot of physics barriers 
getting to that level he said thats why they had to get 
somebody with basic research involved 
phelps said other companies known to be working on 64 megabit 
chips include texas instruments inc and a number of japanese 
companies including hitachi nec and matsushita

saatchi and saatchi first over the wall boasts 
a large poster recently hung on the eastern side of the berlin wall 
it typifies the bravura that helped saatchi amp saatchi co plc 
burst onto the scene in the 1980s and gobble rivals to become the 
worlds largest advertising company 
but that audacity has backfired a foray into consulting 
businesses has been disastrous and costs spiraled out of control 
if the londonbased agency is to recover analysts say it should 
stick to advertising 
after nearly two decades of uninterrupted annual profit growth 
since brothers maurice and charles saatchi founded the company it 
recently reported the first loss about 97 million for the fiscal 
year ended sept 30 
saatchis stock has fallen sharply on londons exchange and the 
company cut its annual dividend 38 percent 
five of the 12 directors have left in the past year and saatchi 
recruited a new chief executive frenchman robert louisdreyfus 
who turned around ims international inc the new yorkbased 
pharmaceutical market research firm 
saatchi already has cut 800 jobs and is trying with apparent 
difficulty to sell its troublesome consulting businesses 
company executives declined to be interviewed but deputy 
chairman jeremy sinclair said in a statement that although ad 
revenue growth has been slowing industrywide saatchi has a 
solid base from which it can develop 
saatchis strategy is to refocus on its communications business 
exploiting advertising operations and strength in public relations 
sales promotions and corporate identity and design the statement 
said 
hopefully they are going to get their house in order said 
richard dale a securities analyst with the london investment firm 
james capel and co 
the saatchi brothers who own less than 5 percent of the stock 
already had been drifting away from the daytoday running of the 
company british press reports suggested 
maurice saatchi 43 relinquished the chief executives role but 
remains chairman charles saatchi 46 remains as executive 
director 
charles has been selling works from his private modern art 
collection considered one of the finest and reportedly is 
depressed over the breakup of his marriage his brother is said to 
have lost some interest in the business since he married in 1984 
the saatchis aversion to publicity has given them a garbolike 
mystique which critics claim is carefully calculated glossy 
british magazines occasionally publish teasing photos of the 
darkhaired intenselooking saatchis trapped by paparazzi 
photographers 
charles reportedly has never attended a saatchi shareholders 
meeting 
but their impact on advertising has been enormous 
they pioneered a global company offering onestop service to 
multinational clients they convinced investors that ad agencies 
were sound cashgenerating investments despite a volatile image 
they incited mergermania in a creative egocentric industry once 
thought invulnerable to corporate empirebuilding 
but saatchis own dash for growth became its weakness although 
megaagency status meant discounts on advertising space the 
company inevitably ended up handling rival accounts 
it lost hundreds of millions of dollars in business from the 
consumer products giants procter amp gamble co and colgatepalmolive 
co and others because clients were concerned about 
confidentiality and conflicts of interest 
born in baghdad to a prosperous textile merchant the saatchis 
grew up in hampstead north london maurice was an academic success 
with a sharp business mind charles proved a brilliant copywriter 
they set up their business in 1970 in soho londons ad agency 
heartland and quickly developed a reputation for simple 
provocative ads their 1971 print ad promoting contraception for 
example showed a pregnant man and asked would you be more 
careful if it was you who got pregnant 
the agency became publicly owned within five years and the 
saatchis chose to relinquish ultimate control in exchange for the 
investors money they needed to expand 
the agency came to prominence in 1979 with the advertising 
campaign that helped the conservatives oust the labor party and put 
margaret thatcher in office labor isnt working said one 
poster depicting a long line of unemployed people 
ambitious and selfmade the saatchis embody the thatcherite 
ideals of entrepreneurship and meritocracy the sunday times list 
of britains richest people estimates the saatchis personal 
fortune at 35 million pounds or 58 million and ranks them tied 
for 178th 
but the saatchis remain foreigners to britains upper crust 
which bristles at their flashy selfcongratulatory style putting 
a billboard on the berlin wall was another example of their 
instinct for the welltimed publicity coup 
to create their megaagency the saatchis embarked on a takeover 
binge that shocked madison avenue and generated much hostility 
against what detractors called creeping saatchiism 
their biggest purchases were ted bates for 450 million dancer 
fitzgerald sample for 75 million and backer and spielvogel for 
56 million all in 1986 that year saatchi became the worlds 
largest ad holding company 
as a result revenues climbed to nearly 700 million in 1986 and 
15 billion in saatchis latest fiscal year from 62 million in 
1982 
it now employs 16600 people in 58 countries and had client 
billings of 135 billion in 1988 giving it control of 5 percent 
of the worldwide advertising market the trade journal advertising 
age said 
saatchi has championed the global translatable campaign like 
its new tv ad for british airways appearing on three continents 
in which 4000 people form a smiling winking face on a vast 
landscape 
to overcome the reluctance of clients to be lumped together with 
their competitors saatchi divided itself into two competing 
international groups saatchi amp saatchi advertising and backer 
spielvogel bates worldwide 
but critics say saatchi overspent on its buying spree took too 
long to combine acquisitions effectively and suffers a lack of 
financial controls 
the turning point analysts say was the 1986 departure of 
martin sorrell saatchis longtime finance director sorrell heads 
the ad agency group wpp group plc which took over madison avenues 
venerable j walter thomspon agency in 1987 and ogilvy amp mather 
last year 
another saatchi blunder analysts say was to diversify into 
consulting maybe if they just stayed to what they knew best they 
would not have gotten themselves into this situation said mark 
shepperd an analyst with ubsphillips and drew 
starting in 1984 saatchi bought eight main consulting 
businesses for 360 million but valuable managers at the 
consulting businesses whose expertise ranged from executive 
recruitment to jury selection began to quit and saatchi wasnt 
winning many crossreferrals 
then in a 1987 move that smacked to some critics of 
megalomania saatchi made unsuccessful takeover overtures at one of 
britains biggest banks midland bank plc and the investment firm 
hill samuel group plc this undermined confidence in saatchi and 
left shareholders confused 
last spring saatchi first warned that profits would suffer and 
announced plans to sell most of the consulting firms so far its 
only sold four small ones for 38 million

the upward spiral that carried the stock markets 
of the world to new highs through much of the 1980s now seems to be 
threatening to transform itself into a vicious cycle in the other 
direction 
and the catchphrase global investing suddenly no longer 
conjures up the heady images it once evoked in the minds of wall 
street brokers and their customers 
the new sequence that has unsettled so many investors and 
business planners played out in typical fashion wednesday 
share prices in the tokyo stock market which has been under 
intermittent pressure because of rising interest rates in japan 
posted a sharp loss driving the bellwether nikkei index of 225 
issues down 59904 points to 3677898 
as the business day shifted to europe stocks also dropped in 
london in selling attributed both to the decline in japan and fears 
of a shaky session in new york 
then trading began on wall street with a burst of selling that 
seemed preordained by what happened earlier in foreign financial 
centers 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell about 60 points in 
early trading on top of a loss of nearly 195 points over the past 
three weeks before staging a partial recovery to finish at 
260450 down 1082 on the day 
at the same time interest rates on us government securities 
continued their recent rise which was touched off by tightening 
monetary conditions abroad 
no matter what the federal reserves intentions for the domestic 
economy many analysts fear us interest rates will be forced 
higher just to stay competitive with higher yields on securities 
available to investors in the far east and europe 
that worry was reinforced tuesday when a government sale of 
40year bonds to finance a rescue plan for troubled thrift 
institutions drew a very chilly reception from investors 
at the extreme some observers worry the next noteworthy 
export to the united states from japan could be not a car or a 
stereo system but a recession aggravated by high borrowing costs 
however a sizeable optimistic contingent in the financial world 
maintains that events arent likely to reach that stage 
world markets toppled in domino fashion during the crash of 
1987 these observers recall but they started coming back strong 
within a matter of months paced by an especially brisk recovery in 
japan 
this time some suggest the us bond market could take a 
leading role in stabilizing the situation 
the more anemic the us economy gets analysts say the greater 
the appeal of treasury bonds might become if only because they 
represent a haven from default risk 
only a few weeks ago interest in us bonds was widespread 
based on an exclusive focus on the weak us economy observed 
robert barbera economist at shearson lehman hutton inc we do 
not expect further bond market deterioration 
should american bonds need a boost furthermore some analysts 
still believe they could get it from the federal reserve which 
might feel compelled to ease credit simply to calm the markets 
said rao chalasani an analyst at the clevelandbased investment 
firm of prescott ball amp turben inc pronounced weakness in us 
markets will ultimately cause the fed to react since the cost of 
preservation is lower before things get out of hand

john lyden pops a certs amid the constant din of 
ringing bells ripping paper and shouting traders on the floor of 
the new york stock exchange 
as a specialist at the big board the nations largest stock 
exchange lydens job often requires close contact and rapidfire 
discourse breath mints are mandatory 
but some securities professionals are questioning whether the 
job of specialist the middleman who ensures fair and fluid buying 
and selling of stocks will be necessary in a future dominated by 
computerized trading 
theyre a horseandbuggy institution in a jetpropelled 
world said robert sobel a business history professor at hofstra 
university technology has made them obsolete 
bunk say lyden and other proponents of the specialist system 
which has been in place since after the civil war 
under the system specialists receive what amount to lucrative 
franchises in handling particular stocks in exchange for setting 
opening prices and keeping trading orderly specialists sell from 
their own inventory when other sellers are scarce and buy when 
buyers cant be found 
last week a draft report by an independent congressional agency 
described the specialist system as faltering and said the human 
operation was outmoded by the capabilities of new technology to 
match buyers and sellers 
academics and wall street officials advising the office of 
technology assessment slammed the report which questioned 
fundamental practices in the stock and futures markets including 
the role of specialists 
lyden who has worked on the exchange floor for 30 years 
following his fathers 42 years undertook his own defense from the 
nyse floor 
the exchange is the only place in the world where common 
stocks are traded in the sunlight totally in the sunlight 
lyden 55 a senior partner in the specialist firm nick lyden amp 
co said in an interview 
we feel if you put all the supply and demand together at one 
particular time in one particular place you get a fair price he 
said and by a fair price i mean integrity 
no one will make a trade in a phone booth no one will make a 
trade in a closet no one will make a trade under the brooklyn 
bridge said lyden whose firm holds franchises in 28 stocks 
including humana inc and shawmut national bank 
with the looks and sincere speech of a bmovie leading man 
lyden is a commanding presence on the floor and a historical one 
too his father ken worked on the exchange floor from age 16 
until his death at age 58 in 1965 moving up from gopher to 
telephone clerk to specialist he even played on the nyses 
baseball team 
after graduating brown university and new york universitys 
business school john lyden joined irving trust bank on wall 
street at his fathers funeral he was asked by one of kens 
younger partners a pallbearer to come to the exchange 
my dad died of a heart attack lyden said standing in the 
middle of the exchanges soaring main room near an idle clerk 
flicking order cards i never had an inclination to be herei 
came into the business at the age of 30 not knowing a buy order 
from a sell order 
lyden said specialists have three roles to make markets for 
individual stocks by pairing buyers and sellers to generate action 
in less heavily traded stocks and to trade for their own accounts 
more than 400 nyse specialists at 49 firms make money through 
commissions for handling trades and by trading stocks for 
themselves with soaring volume the last decade specialists now 
generate about 75 percent of their income from commissions 
but specialists are involved in about 12 percent of nyse trades 
brokers who take orders at banks of yellow telephones on the floor 
often trade with other brokers at a stocks post in those cases 
specialists serve as traffic cops making sure the trade is 
properly recorded 
if there is no buyer or seller the specialist records the order 
in his limit order book and awaits a corresponding transaction 
or the specialist will step in and complete the trade to keep the 
market active 
in a purely electronic system such as the the national 
association of securities dealers automated quotation system 
traders set prices and computer programs match up and execute 
trades 
we feel that everybody in the marketplace whether theyre a 
retail customer or an institutional customer gets a fair price 
lyden said you dont necessarily do that if youre dealing with 
a black box 
the current fuss over the specialist system stems in part from 
the october 1987 stock market crash when an avalanche of sell 
orders threatened to put the specialists under that day 
specialists made 485 million in net purchases and the market 
stayed open 
still some specialists were reluctant to buy stocks because of 
uncertainty others who spent enormous amounts of borrowed money to 
buy stocks faced credit crises with their banks a few went out of 
business 
a securities and exchange commission report on the crash praised 
the system for helping prevent an even worse disaster the report 
said traders of overthecounter stocks simply didnt pick up the 
phone that day some automated execution systems didnt function 
market professionals have long agreed that a market cannot 
work without negotiation nyse president richard a grasso said 
in a cover letter to his sharp critique of the congressional agency 
draft report which was sent back to the drawing board because of 
complaints of shoddy research and unfounded conclusions full 
automated trading systems have been doomed to failure 
said lyden you might not like what happaned that the market 
was down 508 points but at least you had a place to liquidate if 
you wanted out 
to better ensure that specialists can meet extraordinary volume 
orders the nyse increased capital requirements to the equivalent 
of 15000 shares of each stock a firm handles overnight from 5000 
before the crash 
he provides a number of really sophisticated functions and 
the specialist system works said eric k clemons an associate 
professor at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school 
stopping a market correction is not one of them he said 
if the market is overvalued there is no power on earth that can 
stop that

dun amp bradstreet corp which offers an array of 
information services for businesses said wednesday its 
fourthquarter profit climbed 117 percent on a 26 percent rise in 
revenue 
for the year the company that provides the nielsen television 
audience ratings moodys investors service debt ratings and 
mccormack amp dodge construction reports said earnings rose 175 
percent on a 13 percent revenue increase 
the company said its revenue growth was limited by the absence 
of revenue from its official airlines guide which was sold in 1988 
and a decline in sales at its us credit services division stung 
by complaints from some customers that they had been overcharged 
the company said it has taken steps in recent months to address 
problems within the credit services unit 
also limiting revenue growth the company said were the strong 
dollar competition for marketing research products and adverse 
market conditions in the debt and construction markets limiting 
demand for services in those areas 
dun amp bradstreet said it earned 1374 million or 74 cents a 
share in the three months ended dec 31 up from 1231 million 
or 66 cents a share a year earlier 
fourthquarter revenue rose to 116 billion from 113 billion 
a year earlier 
for the year the company earned 5864 million or 314 a 
share up from 499 million or 267 a share a year earlier 
fullyear revenue rose to 432 billion from 427 billion a 
year earlier 
company officials announced in november that they expected 
earnings per share would decline to the range of 280 in 1990 
citing the impact of lower sales at its us credit services and 
the costs of repositioning actions in that area those actions 
included increasing the size of the sales force changing pricing 
and usage policies and steps to improve the depth and timeliness of 
information in its database

19515 a pound

record high settlement of 20535 scored by the same contract only 
four days earlier 
wednesdays action marked the sharpest downturn in orange juice

orange crop and triggered a 64 percent rise in futures prices 
we had really not had a good retracement since the 80 cent 
runup began said analyst celeste georkakis of cargill investor 
services inc the market appears to be coming back in line with 
support levels 
the slide began at the opening bell which was delayed one hour 
by computer problems 
ms georkakis said wednesdays stock market decline probably led 
to profittaking in the orange juice market as players sought money 
to meet margin calls elsewhere 
the dow jones industrial average fell more than 60 points at the 
opening of trading but recovered to finish with only a 10point 
loss 
most livestock and meat futures fell on the chicago mercantile 
exchange ahead of the agriculture departments quarterly 
cattleonfeed report and monthly coldstorage report both of 
which were released after the close and interpreted by analysts as 
bearish for the markets 
the cattle report showed a 3 percent increase in the number of 
cattle on feedlots jan 1 compared with the same date a year ago in 
the 13 largest cattle producing states 
the number was within expectations as was a 10 percent increase 
in feedlot placements during the last quarter of 1989 
but a reported 2 percent drop in marketings was below 
expectations and is likely to result in a weaker opening thursday 
in the april live cattle contract said charles levitt senior 
livestock analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc 
this report certainly tells us were going to get some supply 
relief as we get into the second quarter he said 
the coldstorage report showed 852 million pounds of pork 
bellies in the nations commercial freezers as of dec 31 compared 
with expectations for about 90 million pounds 
live cattle futures settled 25 cent lower to 05 cent higher 
with february at 7870 cents a pound feeder cattle were 43 cent 
lower to 08 cent higher with january at 8450 cents a pound live 
hogs were 62 cent lower to 30 cent higher with february at 4915 
cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 130 cent to 195 cent 
lower with february at 5487 cents a pound 
stockmarket jitters sent gold futures up sharply for the second 
straight day on new yorks commodity exchange but silver succumbed 
to profittaking after a recent rally 
gold finished 4 to 5 higher with february at 41770 a troy 
ounce silver was 82 cents lower across the board with march at 
5258 a troy ounce 
petroleum futures ended mixed on the new york mercantile 
exchange with prices pressured by tuesdays weekly american 
petroleum institute report of increased us inventories of 
gasoline and petroleum distillates 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 10 cents 
lower with february at 1889 a barrel heating oil was 17 cent to 
29 cent higher with february at 5957 cents gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 30 cent lower to 40 cent higher with february at 
5938 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures settled mostly lower on the chicago 
board of trade reflecting slack export demand 
wheat futures finished 1 cent lower to cent higher with march 
at 391 a bushel corn was cent to 1 cent lower with march at 
240 a bushel oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with march at 
139 a bushel soybeans were unchanged to 2 cents lower with

would have to climb further in this country to stay competitive in 
the international marketplace the analysts said

government tuesday of 40year bonds to finance a rescue plan for 
troubled thrift institutions the auction sent market interest 
rates higher and made investors uneasy about the treasurys 
quarterly refunding sale scheduled for next month 
the shortterm direction of interest rates is high and no one 
knows how high theyll go said michael metz an analyst with 
oppenheimer amp co 
meanwhile as the outlook for interest rates worsened investors

chevron corp said wednesday it took a 12 billion charge 
against fourthquarter earnings primarily because of an inactive 
oil field and environmental cleanup costs that led to an 883 
million quarterly loss 
houstonbased shell oil co attributed a 25 percent 
fourthquarter rise in profits to higher crude oil prices 
the charge by san franciscobased chevron depressed 1989 profits 
to 251 million or 73 cents a share from 177 billion or 517 
a share in 1988 the quarterly loss amounted to 258 a share 
compared with profits of 175 million or 51 cents a share in the 
1988 period 
chevron said the largest charge for the quarter was a 598 
million writedown in the value of several producing and 
nonproducing oil and natural gas properties including 445 
million for the idle point arguello field off the southern 
california coast 
in a sharply worded statement chevron chairman kenneth t derr 
criticized a series of regulatory obstacles he said have blocked 
the fields operation for more than two years 
after enduring a series of adverse rulings from what appears 
to be an irrational public policy process i think it is prudent to 
assign a more realistic value to this project he said 
it is irresponsible to prohibit production from already 
developed domestic eneergy reserves at a time when our nation is 
importing by tankers nearly half the oil it needs derr said 
chevron also said it was charging 325 million against 
fourthquarter earnings for future environmental cleanup costs at 
us refining marketing and chemicals locations 
other charges were 164 million for adjustments to prior years 
income taxes 63 million for a property writeoff and other items 
associated with a previously announced restructuring and 53 
million for reserves for regulatory and other issues 
chevrons fourthquarter revenue was 89 billion up from 69 
billion in 1988 for the full year revenue rose to 328 billion 
from 289 billion the previous year 
chevron cited annual losses of 428 million in us exploration 
production refining and marketing which were offset by 708 
million in profits from nonus operations 
for the three months ended dec 31 shell reported earnings of 
264 million on 55 billion in revenue compared with 212 million 
in profits on the same revenue in the same 1988 quarter 
for all of 1989 shell had earnings of 14 billion up from 
12 billion the previous year on revenue of 219 billion 
compared with 214 billion in 1988 
shell does not report pershare figures because it is wholly 
owned by the royal dutchshell group which is based in london and 
the hague netherlands 
shell attributed the increases to higher crude prices which 
benefited oil and gas exploration and production earnings shells 
chemical products performed well but its oil products slumped 
because prices did not recover the increased cost of oil 
oil and gas exploration and production showed profits of 144 
million for the quarter up from 51 million in the same 1988 
period fullyear earnings were 546 million up from 326 million

the san francisco examiner said the 66yearold clausens 
retirement and his successor would be announced before the banks 
annual meeting on may 24 bankamerica spokesman peter magnani 
declined comment wednesday about the report which was attributed 
to unidentified bank sources 
under clausen bankamerica rebounded from three years of huge 
financial losses with a restructuring that saw thousands of 
employees laid off its headquarters building and other major 
assets sold and its business refocused 
it also thwarted unwanted takeover overtures from rival first 
interstate bancorp in an oftenbitter struggle to remain 
independent 
the bank has made a tremendous recovery of health said 
dan williams a bank analyst with sutro and co of san francisco 
it may be that he clausen figures the time to go out is 
when youre on top 
clausen son of a small newspaper publisher from hamilton ill 
joined bankamerica as a 185aweek clerk counting cash in a vault 
in 1949 after he was graduated from the university of minnesota law 
school 
clausen worked his way up to chief executive by 1970 and during 
his tenure bankamerica quadrupled in size he left in 1981 to 
become president of the world bank in washington 
san franciscobased bankamerica the holding company for bank of 
america suffered three years of huge losses starting in 1985 much 
of its problems were blamed on losses from bad loans to developing 
nations and on real estate and farm loans in the united states 
in 1986 it eliminated its common stock dividend for the first 
time since the depression bankamerica once the largest banking 
concern in the country fell behind other giants such as citicorp 
and chase manhattan corp on the basis of assets 
some banking experts blamed much of bankamericas problems on 
clausen contending he contributed to many of its difficulties 
before leaving in 1981 with such moves as decentralization of its 
lending operations 
but clausen claimed the bank had lost the confidence of 
customers its board staff and shareholders because of 
overpromising and underperforming management of which he was 
not a part 
clausen returned as chairman in 1986 replacing ousted boy 
wonder samuel armacost who had earned the nickname clausens 
clone under armacost bankamerica was rocked by almost 6 
billion in loan losses and the battle with first interstate 
if we are given the time we will return our bank to its 
position of preeminence clausen pledged on his return the 
restructuring program will work i am absolutely confident 
about our strategy 
bankamerica sold assets including its world headquarters in san 
francisco for 660 million and its charles schwab discount 
brokerage subsidiary it cut expenses laid off 9000 employees and 
expanded hours while experiencing strong growth in domestic 
consumer and residential mortgage loans 
last february bank of america restored its common stock 
dividend last week the company reported 1989 earnings were up 52 
percent from a year earlier to 11 billion the biggest annual 
profit in its 86yearhistory it currently ranks fourth among bank 
holding companies with 829 billion in assets 
candidates seen as likely to succeed clausen include richard 
rosenberg 59 vice chairman of the board of bankamerica corp or 
frank newman 47 vice chairman and chief financial officer for 
bankamerica both worked previously for wells fargo amp co 
rosenberg was with wells for 22 years leaving a job there as 
vice chairman he also worked as vice chairman for crocker bank and 
was chief operating officer of seafirst corp newman spent 13 years 
with wells fargo working as executive vice president and chief 
financial officer before coming to bankamerica

sometimes you have to take a second look at some 
deeply embedded impressions 
in the 1980s the economy grew for seven straight years longest 
peacetime advance ever but 
during the 1980s us real gross national product has grown 
at an annual rate of 26 percent the slowest rate of growth for 
any decade since the 1930s according to john winthrop wright of 
wright investors service 
even the oftmaligned 1970s the decade that gave rise to the 
term stagflation managed a better annual real gnp growth rate of 
28 percent wright said in his 19th annual review and forecast to 
the new york society of security analysts in december 
you have to go back to the depressionera 1930s to find a lower 
growth rate a meager 01 percent a year he said 
many people in the 1980s held strongly to another impression 
that taxes really had been cut in part because president reagan 
stood for lower taxes and in fact helped engineer a big tax cut 
early in his first term but 
we are no better off than in 1981 despite strong economic 
growth and much ballyhooed cuts in income tax rates according to 
the tax foundation 
the foundation hasnt yet determined when tax freedom day will 
occur this year but because of higher social security taxes it 
probably will be later than in 1989 when it occurred on may 4 and 
1988 when it fell on may 3 
tax freedom day it says is the theoretical date on which 
americans finish working to support federal state and local 
entities and begin earning money for themselves conceivably it 
might even be later this year than in 1980 
it attributes the standoff to three main factors 
1 the basebroadening provisions in the tax reform act of 1986 
and other legislation that subjected a greater percentage of income 
to taxation 
2 social security taxes that increased faster than the overall 
economy 
3 state and local taxes that continued to rise partly in 
reaction to reductions in federal aid programs 
another major misimpression concerns the amounts of money 
available for spending by choice rather than necessity 
during the 1980s discretionary income the amount of income 
left after paying for taxes and normal household expenditures 
rose sharply such income totaled nearly 320 billion in a census 
bureau survey in march 1987 or 22 percent more than in the 
previous report four years earlier 
moreover an analysis issued by the commerce department and the 
conference board in 1989 showed that 30 percent of us households 
now have income beyond that needed for a comfortable living 
but according to that report it took a major effort by two 
breadwinners rather than just one 
in their analysis they observed that households with two or 
more people earning a paycheck account for 65 percent of all us 
discretionary dollars most of this income is in families where 
both husband and wife are working 
in addition the discretionary income was shown to be 
geographically skewed in announcing its findings the board a 
nonprofit research organization stated 
a wellaboveaverage 34 percent of all homes in the new 
england states have discretionary income the incidence also runs 
relatively high in the pacific and south atlantic regions 
in the mountain middle atlantic and east south central 
states the prevalence of discretionary income homes tends to be 
below the national average

the nations top securities regulator wednesday 
called on congress to remove legal and regulatory barriers so the 
united states could meet increasing competition in world financial 
markets 
securities and exchange commission chairman richard c breeden 
said the strength of japan as a financial center and the removal of 
european trade barriers in 1992 would give us capital markets 
their first real challenge 
breeden just back from three days of meetings in japan said 
securities professionals there told him the united states is 
regarded as the source of innovation and creativity in financial 
products 
we have to recognize that here at home and get rid of some of 
the legal and regulatory barriers breeden said at a meeting of 
the securities regulation institute 
breeden said the european economic communitys single market 
would mean standardized disclosure and takeover rules for companies 
and no barriers to banks engaging in the securities business as in 
the united states 
among other steps breeden called on congress to remove barriers 
to stock market trading of hybrid securities that have elements 
of futures 
a federal court recently banned trading of a stockindex future 
on the philadelphia and american stock exchange because of 
restrictions limiting such products to commodities exchanges 
if you can find one smidgen of futurity then that product 
becomes unlawful on stock exchanges breeden said that sets up 
the prospect that all products will have to go to the courthouse 
before going to investors 
similar securities are available to investors on the london and 
toronto stock exchanges he said 
breeden also said the united states should eliminate barriers 
under the glasssteagall act to allow banks to enter the securities 
business make takeover laws parallel in all states and remove 
barriers to interstate banking 
breeden also supported lowering barriers to foreign investment 
to make it harder for other countries to keep out us investors 
and companies 
along those lines he said japanese officials indicated they 
would allow foreign mutual funds into their countrys 500 billion 
investment trust business now limited to 14 japanese companies 
we believe the us mutual funds are the finest in the 
world breeden told reporters we would like to see them in 
japanese markets particularly the retail markets 
at a separate session former sec chairman david s ruder 
challenged the commission to become more active and farsighted in 
pushing for laws reforming the securities industry 
ruder who presided over the sec during two tumultuous years 
that included the october 1987 stock market crash and wall streets 
insider trading scandals called for a major study of securities 
industry reforms such as one undertaken in 1962 
there should be a study not only of volatility but of 
littleknown problems in the industry and we need to assess 
whether the crazyquilt regulation we have in the us over the 
banking and securities industries is the right one ruder said 
but breeden said there is too little time to undertake such a 
study which he said would take years 
id like to see congress and the administration get on with 
the task of reforming the securities market he said 
congress this session is considering a series of bills on market 
reform including the possibility of placing responsibility for 
regulating the nations stock and futures markets under one body 
ruder said he believes congress would be forced to reevaluate 
scrapping the glasssteagall act to allow banks to underwrite 
securities 
our financial institutions are going to be at a severe 
competitive disadvantage in the world if they cannot engage in 
banking and securities transactions at the same time he said

ge aerospace plans to cut nearly 14 percent 
of its work force eliminating more than 5700 jobs over the next 
two years as expectations of reduced pentagon spending continue to 
grip the defense industry 
about 5600 of the job cuts will be in the eastern part of the 
country a spokesman said wednesday 
the reductions are part of a program begun early last year aimed 
at trimming a total of 10000 from the payrolls in 1989 ge 
aerospace a division of general electric co trimmed 4775 from 
its work force about 4000 positions will be eliminated this year 
with the remaining 1600 jobs to be cut in 1991 spokesman don 
norton said 
the company said no specific decisions have been made on where 
or when the remaining reductions will be made the decisions will 
be made as business conditions develop it said 
ge aerospace the nations thirdlargest defense contractor is 
based in king of prussia pa 
norton said the cutbacks will come through layoffs and attrition 
throughout the division which has more than a dozen plants mostly 
in the northeast 
by january 1992 the aerospace unit will be left with 35500 
employees down from 47000 in january 1988 at latest count the 
division employed 41108 
on tuesday general electric reported a 16 percent increase in 
profits in the fourth quarter of 1989 the parent earned 117 
billion or 130 a share up from 101 billion or 112 a share 
the nations defense spending has been stagnant in real terms 
for the last few years amid public concern over the federal budget 
deficit misconduct by defense contractors and the changing 
political climate in eastern europe 
in addition to declining us expenditures for defense the 
cutbacks are a matter of staying competitive in a much tougher 
business climate norton said 
earlier this month seattlebased boeing co said it expects to 
cut 5000 workers this year the aerospace giant said the move was 
made partly because of warmer eastwest relations that have dimmed 
the outlook for its defense business company officials said 
further layoffs were possible 
also in january the martinmarietta astronautics group 
announced plans to cut about 200 jobs by the end of next month the 
company said some of the jobs would be transferred to other 
businesses 
last year ge aerospaces aircraftelectronics unit based in 
utica ny was hit heavily with cutbacks employment held fairly 
steady at the astrospace operation in east windsor nj and at 
the king of prussia plant which makes satellites 
jobs at moorestown nj where the aegis radar system for the 
navy is made increased slightly 
about half of the 4775 jobs cut by ge aerospace last year were 
in units sold by the company including the 1000employee 
instrumentproducts operation in wilmington mass which was sold 
to ametek inc of paoli pa 
ge aerospace has no plans to sell any other units norton said 
the aerospace unit also includes plants in king of prussia and 
philadelphia in pennsylvania camden moorestown and east windsor 
nj binghamton and syracuse ny pittsfield and burlington

a group that includes four big california 
utilities unveiled an energy conservation plan wednesday aimed at 
saving hundreds of millions of dollars a year by paying people to 
buy more efficient homes and appliances and allowing stockholders 
to benefit from energy savings 
the plan by a coalition of businesses consumer advocates and 
environmentalists is intended to save fuel clean the air and 
ultimately lower costs for consumers 
by offering customers more incentives to use energy more 
efficiently we can help them reduce their energy costs and we can 
avoid or postpone having to build new power plants said virgil 
rose a vice president of pacific gas amp electric co one of four 
major utilities taking part in the plan 
utilities would be paying people to use less of their 
product observed ralph cavanagh of the natural resources defense 
council 
the plan calls for giving money to builders to encourage 
construction of homes and offices with better insulation and 
energysaving heating and cooling systems giving rebates to 
customers for buying energysaving appliances and financing free 
or lowcost home improvements for lowincome and elderly residents 
there was little incentive for utilities to make those 
investments in the late 1980s with fuel supplies abundant and oil 
and gas prices dropping utility conservation programs dropped 
sharply spending at pgampe dropped from 138 million in 1985 to 81 
million in 1988 and at san diego gas amp electric co from 178 
million in 1983 to 29 million in 1989 
the result has been increased home energy use more pollution 
and a greater depletion of resources 
the new plan set in motion by the state public utilities 
commission last july will be defined more fully in march when the 
four utilities pgampe sdgampe southern california edison and 
southern california gas submit formal proposals to the commission 
although elements of the plan have been used elsewhere in the 
country the size of the four utilities give their effort added 
importance 
pgampe and southern california edison are the nations two largest 
utilities in terms of sales the four utilities together serve at 
least three quarters of californias population cavanagh said 
others joining in the conservation plan included groups of 
developers small power producers water agencies the pucs 
consumer staff and the consumer group toward utility rate 
normalization 
the 82page proposal calls for 2638 million in conservation 
spending by the four utilities this year and 300 million in 1991 
those are no higher than mid1980s spending levels taking 
inflation into account but they are substantial increases over the 
totals of 153 million in 1988 and 1713 million in 1989 
the report said utilities should have fuel savings worth at 
least twice the added investment cost the utilities primarily burn 
domestically produced oil and gas in addition the report said 
similar programs in other states have estimated the benefits from 
environmental improvement as being worth 15 percent to 25 percent 
of the value of fuel savings 
customers though initially paying higher rates to subsidize the 
programs should get most of the savings through lower utility 
bills in the long run the report said 
the major incentive for utilities however is that some of the 
savings would go to stockholders under pgampes proposal for 
example 30 percent of the estimated fuel savings from most of 
programs and 5 percent of the costs of lowincome assistance would 
be given to stockholders 
the possibility of increased earnings can encourage utility 
management to search actively for new energyefficiency 
opportunities and to implement the programs effectively the 
report said summarizing the views of those who favor incentives 
the report also quoted opponents as saying the incentives were 
unnecessary would increase rates and were no substitute for puc 
regulation 
half or more of all spending would be on incentives for 
energyefficient new buildings 
utilities also are proposing a variety of individual programs 
pgampe wants to offer customers rebates of 50 and 100 for buying 
refrigerators that exceed federal efficiency standards by 10 or 15 
percent edison is proposing a design competition with 2500 
prizes for energyefficient buildings 
publicly owned utilities like the sacramento municipal utility 
district are not covered by the plan but the state energy 
commission said it would pursue conservation policies with them as 
well

great northern nekoosa corp the target 
of a hostile takeover offer reported a 39 percent drop in net 
income in the fourth quarter partly because of the cost of fending 
off the bid 
net income was 52 million or 92 cents a share compared to 
858 million or 156 a share in the last quarter of 1988 great 
northern said tuesday 
the norwalkbased paper company said its earnings per share were 
reduced by 33 cents because of the 38 billion offer made late 
last year by georgiapacific corp a forest products company in 
atlanta 
great northern is fighting georgiapacific using antitakeover 
provisions in its bylaws and an antitrust suit in connecticut 
chairman william r laidig also attributed the decline to a 
general downturn in the paper industry due to overcapacity 
business conditions changed around midyear when increasing 
paper capacity began to affect the supplydemand balance in many of 
our markets he said generally prices for most of our 
products had been relatively stable the first half of the year but 
weakened modestly in the third quarter and continued to weaken in 
the fourth 
great northern said fourthquarter sales fell 1 percent to 934 
million from 9441 million a year earlier shipments of pulp 
paper and containerboard from the companys mills fell 277 percent 
in the fourth quarter because of harsh weather at the companys 
southern mills 
net income for the year fell 6 percent to 321 million or 578 
a share from 3417 million or 621 a share in 1988 sales rose 
8 percent to 39 billion from 36 billion in 1988 
the outlook is a tough call because most of our markets are 
becoming more competitive laidig said our performance in 1990 
will depend on the strength of the us economy and the growth in 
demand for our products

ual corps three employee unions on wednesday 
proposed the acquisition of 75 percent of the airline companys 
stock by all employees leaving the remaining 25 percent in the 
publics hands 
in a letter to the companys board of directors united 
airlines pilots flight attendants and machinists said they were 
prepared to negotiate as a group for the acquisition of stock 
through one or more employee stock ownership plans or esops 
the employees offered wage concessions and longterm contracts 
in return 
we are unified as never before in our view that majority 
ownership of the company is the only acceptable means to resolve 
the issues that plague united the letter concluded 
uals board of directors is scheduled to meet thursday and had 
been planning to consider a recapitalization urged on the 
chicagobased company by one of its largest shareholders the 
coniston partners investment group holder of an 118 percent stake 
but keith gollust one of conistons principals said late 
wednesday that he and his partners were really pleased at the 
new development and were backing away from their insistence on a 
recapitalization to boost the value of ual shares 
we have always favored an employee buyout as an alternative 
gollust said in a telephone interview from his new york office 
we think this is a great step forward 
gollust said a recapitalization which likely would involve new 
borrowing by ual to make a payout to shareholders ought to 
remain as a backup alternative 
joe hopkins spokesman for ual the parent company of united 
declined comment on the esop proposal 
an esop typically buys stock with borrowed money and pays it 
back over a number of years with dividends on the shares 
the ual employees letter offered no specifics on how they plan 
to finance their proposed purchase of 17 million of uals 226 
million shares which would cost about 27 billion at wednesdays 
closing stock price of 16150 
officials of the three unions did not return phone calls 
airlines analyst samuel buttrick of kidder peabody amp co said 
the apparent harmony among uals unions and their willingness to 
take paycuts were a positive sign but the notable lack of 
specifics on structure and financing indicates that only minimal 
progess has been made on an ultimate resolution 
in return for a majority stake in the company the employees 
said they were prepared to make significant investments 
including an acceptance of lower wages under 5year contracts 
the investments including the contributions of nonunion 
employees would total about 300 million in the first year and 2 
billion over the life of the contracts the union group said 
the letter did not describe the proposed investments or specify 
how the unions proposed to divide the stock among uals four 
employee groups 
our objective is to form a unique partnership among the 
company and all employees that will permit the company to 
immediately return to the position of the worlds best airline 
and to grow and prosper into the future read the letter 
the letter was signed by john peterpaul vice president of the 
machinists union frederick c dubinsky chairman of the united 
chapter of the air line pilots association and diana robertson 
president of the united chapter of the association of flight 
attendants 
uals stock climbed 6 to close at 16150 wednesday in new york 
stock exchange trading 
ual directors are under pressure from coniston partners a new 
yorkbased investment group with 118 percent of uals stock to 
quickly approve a transaction that will boost shareholder value 
coniston urged uals directors to explore a recapitalization 
after management and the pilots failed to pull together a buyout 
offer by jan 8 the date of the last board meeting 
at that meeting the board directed its financial adviser first 
boston corp to explore the merits of a recapitalization and come 
up with a proposal for thursdays meeting 
but the board also said it reamined open to buyout proposals 
both the pilots and the united chapter of the association of 
flight attendants have expressed strong opposition to any 
recapitalization that would increase the indebtedness of the 
nations secondlargest airline and allow for anything less than
