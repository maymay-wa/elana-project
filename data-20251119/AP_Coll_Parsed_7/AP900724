supreme court nominee david h souter worked 
with white house officials tuesday in preparation for tough senate 
confirmation questions declaring his blood was circulating a 
little bit better as the astonishment of his selection began to 
wear off 
he brushed aside questions about his views on abortion one of 
the issues senators are sure to emphasize during the confirmation 
hearings that are expected to begin in september 
president bush cautioned the senate not to accept or reject 
souter on the basis of any single issue and predicted he will be 
a great justice 
congressional leaders comments were mostly muted as were 
remarks from interest groups on the left and right souter was 
still an unknown quantity 
elliot mincberg of the liberal people for the american way 
said he doesnt have much of a track record pat mcguigan of 
the conservative heritage foundation said nobody knows anything 
about him in terms of senate confirmation this is very helpful 
a report of souters unfavorable comments about affirmative 
action emerged in wednesday editions of the union leader in 
manchester nh 
in a 1976 speech at commencement exercises of new england 
aeronautical institute and daniel webster college souter 
criticized federal guidelines which require an employer to give 
preference to a particular ethnic or racial group saying the 
government should not be involved in this 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration 
had enlisted kenneth m duberstein a private lobbyist who was a 
white house chief of staff in the reagan administration to serve 
as a private adviser to steer souter through the confirmation 
process 
souter spent several hours at the white house where he was 
interviewed by the fbi to update his judicial clearance and told by 
presidential aides that his life would be picked apart and 
everything he had ever written or said closely scrutinized 
one participant who spoke only on the condition of anonymity 
said souter calmly listened to the advice and indicated there was 
nothing in his past that he felt uncomfortable with 
one senior administration official said white house counsel c 
boyden gray questioned souter monday morning about whether there 
was anything in his background that might prove embarrassing such 
as the marijuana use that forced douglas ginsburg to withdraw as a 
reagan administration nominee in 1987 souters answers were all 
satisfactory the official said 
administration sources said bush interviewed one other possible 
nominee monday edith h jones of the 5th us circuit court of 
appeals in houston before choosing souter two other judges 
laurence h silberman of the us circuit court of appeals in 
washington and solicitor general kenneth w starr were on the 
final list but were not interviewed the sources said 
souter met with the presidents congressional liaison fred 
mcclure and other aides while the president himself touted his 
choice while out campaigning for gop candidates in the northeast 
bush called souter whom he met for the first time monday a 
great man of enormous intelligence strength a tough trial court 
judge with a great legal mind and an impartial quality that will 
serve the court well 
there was no immediate argument to that glowing portrayal from 
capitol hill in souter 50 a longtime new hampshire state judge 
and since april a member of the 1st us court of appeals in 
boston bush found a candidate without a record on abortion or 
other controversial topics 
at this point its no hits no runs no errors it may not be 
a good thing in a justice but its a good thing in sending up a 
nominee to be confirmed said sen howard metzenbaum dohio a 
liberal member of the senate judiciary committee 
sen orrin hatch rutah a senior conservative on the 
committee said he hadnt heard a single senator express misgivings 
about souter 
not any he said its amazing to me to have a 
conservative who is accepted by both sides of the fence as he is 
he said 
hatch in a morning radio interview raised some eyebrows when 
he mentioned as a possible concern the fact that souter had never 
been married 
i didnt mean that the way it came off he said later 
having a wife and family just helps expose a man to the wide 
range of human emotions a good thing for a judge he said 
bush on monday announced his choice of souter to fill the 
vacancy created by the retirement last friday of justice william 
brennan the president was to formally submit the nomination to the 
senate on wednesday after which souter was to pay courtesy calls 
on republican and democratic leaders 
it is just the normal practice associated with new nominees 
said mcclure who along with sen warren rudman rnh was to 
shepherd souter around capitol hill rudman is a longtime 
acquaintance and the judge was using his office as a base of 
operations during his visit to washington 
rudman and souter invited news organizations in for a photo 
session during which souter said he was just getting used to the 
idea that he was the nominee 
the blood is circulating a little bit better than it was 
yesterday afternoon at five oclock he said i didnt think it 
was going to happen i was astonished 
souter who seemed nervous at bushs side the day before 
appeared relaxed on wednesday smiling and bantering with reporters 
he brushed aside all substantive questions such as his views on 
abortion saying he would withhold comment until his confirmation 
hearings 
judiciary committee chairman joseph biden ddel has not set a 
date for the hearings although several gop lawmakers said they 
hoped they would take place early in september bush called on 
congress to approve his nomination before the court begins its fall 
term on the first monday in october

rocky flats nuclear weapons plant 
executives on tuesday unveiled a fiveyear 150 million plan to 
correct environmental and management problems at the plant 
in announcing the plan bob nelson the department of energys 
rocky flats manager said the plant shut since last november 
because of safety concerns wouldnt resume plutonium production 
for several months 
there are still a lot of things that need to be fixed its a 
restart months away rather than weeks away other than that i 
cant say nelson told reporters 
the governmentfinanced cleanup plan addresses 92 findings by 
energy secretary james d watkins socalled tiger team that 
inspected the plant outside denver last summer 
the problems ranged from lack of a single onsite environmental 
executive to paving of a parking lot apparently to reduce 
windblown dust from the plant that manufactures plutonium triggers 
for nuclear weapons 
dave simonson does deputy plant manager said 55 of the 
findings by the tiger team will be corrected by the end of the year 
among the complaints are that soil and groundwater are 
contaminated and that sewage treatment plant is contaminated with 
hazardous though not radioactive waste residents fear that 
contaminated water from the sewage treatment plant has seeped into 
their groundwater supplies 
the plan also calls for hiring or training certified operators 
for the sewage treatment plant 
the plan doesnt cover the ongoing removal of 62 pounds of 
plutonium from the ventilation ducts of several plant buildings 
nelson noted that the present plant contractor egampg inc took 
over from rockwell international on jan 1 months after the tiger 
team inspection 
rockwell wont have to pay for the cleanup nelson said

the parents of an infant girl who starved to 
death on an herbal diet were sentenced to nearly two years in 
prison on tuesday for failing to provide the necessities of life 
for their daughter 
khachadour atikian 54 and his wife sonia 38 showed little 
emotion as they were led handcuffed from ontario supreme court 
after justice john odriscoll imposed the maximum sentence two 
years less one day in jail 
their 16monthold daughter lorie died in september 1987 her 
emaciated jaundiced body had wasted away to 11 pounds 
the judge said the maximum term is reserved for the worst 
scenarios adding quite frankly i cant think of a worse 
possible situation than this 
how could anyone in their right mind and in their right senses 
not see this helpless child id call not one but a dozen 
ambulances odriscoll said 
the couple came to canada from lebanon in the mid1970s and have 
two healthy teenage children 
a jury convicted them this month after witnesses at the sixweek 
trial testified about the atikians involvement with an herbalist 
evidence suggested the herbalist persuaded the parents that 
doctors would kill their baby 
one witness said the herbalist told the mother taking the infant 
to a doctor would be like holding a loaded gun to the babys head 
and pulling the trigger 
testimony said the herbalist insisted the atikians should follow 
his health and diet regimen if they wanted to have the 
superbaby they planned 
a picture of lorie on her first birthday presented as evidence 
showed a normal healthy child a police photograph taken hours 
after lories death showed her birdlike frame covered with rashes 
and open sores 
the jury was told lorie had not been seen by a doctor for more 
than eight months and had never been immunized against disease her 
diet consisted of brown rice raw vegetables pureed fruits and 
fruit juices but no milk 
the day before the baby died the herbalist told mrs atikian to 
wrap lorie in cabbage leaves to draw out the poisons the jury was 
told 
the herbalist is being investigated by the ontario college of 
physicians and surgeons to see if he has been practicing medicine 
without a license such a finding could lead to criminal charges

dense smoke on monday obscured the more 
than 100 fires that had charred one million acres of forest and 
tundra and the weather remained warm and dry 
one fire burned within two miles of an underground section of 
the transalaska oil pipeline but didnt threaten the line 
smokejumpers and firefighting crews who had been released 
after showers helped dampen many of alaskas fires were being 
recalled said john quinley a spokesman at denali national park 
in the lower 48 two dozen new fires were started by lightning 
in washington state crews made progress against other fires in 
that state and in utah oregon california and montana while 
lightning ignited new blazes in idaho 
crews in alaska concentrated on just a few of the 129 fires 
reported burning across the central part of the state said trish 
hogervorstrukke a spokeswoman with the alaska fire information 
center in fairbanks 
theyre concentrating on the fires threatening structures 
hogervorstrukke said 
the smoke is so dense that its reducing temperatures and 
raising the relative humidity in some areas she said the sun 
simply cant penetrate it 
the flip side is that we cant see the fires were using a 
specially modified plane with an infrared camera to look through 
the smoke and locate the hot spots 
ninety fire crews or more than 2600 people were fighting the 
fires which had charred 1006080 acres of alaska timber and 
tundra by monday officials said most of the fires were caused by 
lightning 
an airquality alert was declared in fairbanks during the 
weekend because of smoke visibility at a visitors center at denali 
national park dropped to a quartermile during the weekend 
the interruption of lightaircraft flights had repercussions in 
some communities not served by roads 
the smoke grounded some light planes a lifeline to much of 
nearroadless interior

of an airtaxi service in the kuskokwim river community of mcgrath 
225 miles northwest of anchorage where visibility early monday was

the states most laborintensive fire occupying 789 firefighters 
the beaver fire north of the yukon river was alaskas largest 
as of sunday it had burned across a section of spruce forest 10 
miles wide by 48 miles long hogervorstrukke said the fire had 
approached to within four miles of the chandalar river and 
authorities expected the blaze to diminish once it hit the river 
she said 
the kanuti flats fire about 140 miles north of fairbanks had 
burned through 100000 acres of tundra and was within two miles of 
a buried section of the transalaska pipeline authorities were 
monitoring the fire but it was not being fought 
in northcentral washington firefighters contained a 
humancaused wildfire in 634 acres of grass brush and trees and 
reported progress monday on a 300acre blaze in eastern skagit 
county 
sheela mclean of the okanogan national forest in northcentral 
washington said 24 fires none more than an acre were noted monday 
after a series of thundershowers 
firefighters near richfield utah in the southcentral part of 
the state were close monday to declaring full control over a fire 
that had charred about 250 acres on rugged terrain in the fishlake 
national forest 
about 500 firefighters worked in central oregon to control a 
blaze in the deschutes national forest the topso butte fire about 
15 miles east of la pine or south of bend had spread through 680

the law enforcement officers of cop rock 
burst into song in twin peaks they guzzle coffee speak in 
hyperbole and covet cherry pie 
is abc being weird simply for the sake of being weird has tv 
gotten so predictable that the only way to stand out is to be 
completely off the wall 
not if you ask cop rock creator steven bochco or twin 
peaks executive producer mark frost 
i think theres a real trap in trying to create programming 
that is simply going to be scarier or more out there than the next 
guys program bochco told tv columnists during a weekend session 
of abcs summer press tour 
and no frost said twin peaks was not trying to pull a fast 
one on its audience by being confusing 
i think thats ascribing some pretty terrible character traits 
to us frost said i dont think wed give up two years of our 
lives to play a joke on the american public 
but the questions asked of bochco and frost during separate 
sessions at the century plaza hotel centered on whether these two 
shows werent just a little too out there for the american public 
cop rock is abcs newest venture into the realm of weird tv 
and makes its debut in the fall the pilot with music by randy 
newman has been screened for tv critics and affiliated stations of 
abc 
the affiliates didnt quite know what to make of the first 
installment which contained a jury belting out a guilty verdict in 
choir robes a junkie selling her baby for a fix and a police 
officer who resolves a botched attempt to arrest a copkiller by 
simply murdering him 
during last months affiliate convention in los angeles a large 
portion of the audience walked out during the cop rock 
screening 
several complained to bochco the mastermind of hits such as 
hill street blues and la law that cop rock wouldnt 
play in peoria 
twin peaks by frost and film director david lynch 
premiered as a spring replacement series in april and almost 
immediately became one of the most talkedabout and writtenabout 
shows in television history 
the goingson of a fictional northwest lumber town included the 
murder of homecoming queen laura palmer a dwarf who spoke 
backwards in a dream sequence lots of talk about coffee and junk 
food and enough plot twists to induce motion sickness 
when the series ended this season without solving the murder of 
beauty queen palmer audiences were incensed 
twin peaks will repeat all eight original episodes beginning 
aug 5 its fall season begins sunday sept 30 with a twohour 
special after which the series moves to a new time slot 10 pm 
saturday 
frost in keeping with the shows tone was humorously vague 
about what will happen next season 
he hedged about when or how palmers murderer will be 
identified 
coffeeloving fbi agent dale cooper played by kyle maclachlan 
will remain in twin peaks investigating other crimes besides 
palmers killing frost said 
obviously cooper survives the seasonending shooting by a 
mysterious gunperson frost said 
i thought we were poking a little fun at the who shot jr 
episode of cbs dallas frost said 
of course hes wearing a bulletproof vest hes an fbi agent 
who just came off an undercover assignment 
bochco gave away a few plot tidbits for cop rock the 
murdering police officer will be indicted and actress barbara 
bosson also bochcos wife will undergo cosmetic surgery as the 
fictional and corrupt mayor of los angeles 
miss bosson who starred in hill street blues and 
hooperman is covered with disfiguring latex makeup in the 
cop rock pilot 
newmans musical input was limited to the pilot bochco said an 
inhouse team of music writers supplies five songs for each 
subsequent episode 
the idea for cop rock came from someone who suggested hill 
street blues should be a broadway musical bochco said

catching a genetically engineered cold 
might one day be a way to alleviate some of the worst symptoms of 
cystic fibrosis researchers say 
researchers are trying to insert a lifesaving gene into viruses 
that cause the common cold such genetically engineered viruses 
might be able to carry the gene into the lung tissue of cystic 
fibrosis patients whose lungs are clogged with mucus and prone to 
sometimes fatal infections 
these are already being tested said robert beall vice 
president for medical affairs at the cystic fibrosis foundation in 
bethesda md 
the genetically altered cold viruses are among cystic fibrosis 
research studies made possible by last years discovery of the 
cystic fibrosis gene 
on monday lap chee tsui one of the discoverers of the gene 
said that a single rare kind of defect in the gene has been found 
in about 70 percent of cystic fibrosis carriers he spoke at the 
jackson laboratory in bar harbor 
cystic fibrosis is the most common genetic disease in 
caucasians it affects about one in 2000 caucasian babies but it 
is relatively uncommon in other populations 
the rare defect found in many carriers occurs almost exclusively 
in caucasians explaining why the disease is more common in 
caucasians than in others said tsui professor of molecular and 
medical genetics at the university of toronto 
it is marked by digestive and respiratory problems especially 
the buildup of thick mucus in the lungs that can lead to recurrent 
infections that often prove fatal 
the cause of the disease is not known but the discovery of the 
faulty gene should allow researchers to sort out exactly what is 
going wrong in the lungs pancreas and other affected organs 
for example researchers have now identified an antibody to 
track the protein made by the cystic fibrosis gene beall said 
studies suggest that the protein is getting where it is supposed to 
go but it is not doing the job it is supposed to do 
such clues are essential in figuring out precisely what is going 
wrong in cystic fibrosis patients then devising ways to fix it 
one unfortunate development has been the discovery that in 
addition to the one defect identified in caucasians more than 40 
other kinds of mutations in the cystic fibrosis gene can also cause 
cystic fibrosis 
that complicates the job of prenatal diagnosis of cystic 
fibrosis at present researchers cannot tell parents whether their 
children will be born with the disease 
in families in which one child has the disease however doctors 
can do prenatal tests to determine whether subsequent fetuses are 
affected with the disease

portauprince haiti ap the return from exile of two key 
figures in past dictatorial regimes is threatening the survival of 
haitis caretaker government fueling doubts about whether credible 
elections can be held 
lawlessness plagues this impoverished caribbean nation of 6 
million people violence is on the rise with unpunished political 
killings heightening the sense of fear and distrust 
political leaders say they are under constant death threats and 
never sleep at home fearing assassination 
you drive with your hand on your gun you avoid taking the 
same roads you sleep at friends homes never your own house 
said jeanclaude roy leader of the haitian constitutional union a 
centerleft party 
we will not go into elections with this type of terror in the 
streets said presidential candidate louis dejois jr 
general elections are tentatively planned for nov 4 
critics say president ertha pascaltrouillot is weak breaks 
promises cant control the army and doesnt consult with the 
18member council of state with which she is supposed to govern 
jointly 
many political leaders blame her 4monthold government for 
creating an atmosphere that allowed the return of roger lafontant 
reputed head of the tonton macoutes the brutal militia that 
enforced the 29year duvalier dictatorship 
lafontant was the chief of everybody here it is like the 
return of himmler the head of the gestapo said serge voltaire 
a member of the council of state everybody is afraid of him and 
shes not doing anything 
the duvalier family dictatorship which began in 1957 when 
francois duvalier gained the presidency ended in 1986 when his son 
jeanclaude baby doc duvalier fled the country after months of 
civil disorder 
also back from exile is retired army maj gen williams regala 
who went to the united states following the march ouster of lt 
gen prosper avril one of a succession of military men who ruled 
after jeanclaude duvalier doc fled 
as minister of interior and defense regala was responsible for 
security during the thwarted november 1987 attempt at elections 
balloting was canceled after 34 voters were shot and hacked to 
death by thugs linked to the army 
lafontant who is in hiding has hired three lawyers to aid his 
effort to remain in haiti he said last week before going into 
hiding that he intends to become president 
the pressure has been building for mrs pascaltrouillot to 
arrest lafontant but the army isnt carrying out her orders 
the problem is not madame trouillot the problem is the 
army said social affairs minister claudette werleigh i dont 
know if she has power or even if the general himself has power 
the general is armed forces chief herard abraham who commands a 
corrupt and often violent force of 6000 
its not clear to the army that this democracy is in their 
best interest and because of this they are ambivalent said marc 
bazin former world bank economist and presidential candidate 
but they are not interested in returning to the past 
some haitians speculate that duvalier is to return from his 
french exile 
the duvalierists just want a chance to come back to power 
said ms werleigh and the level of misery is so low in this 
country the people would accept money from duvalierists 
when mrs pascaltrouillot was appointed provisional president 
on march 13 expectations ran high perhaps too high that the 
rampant lawlessness and corruption that was the stamp of 
duvalierism might be stemmed 
how can you expect a transitional government to be expedient 
in bringing justice said bazin you need a government that has 
legitimacy nationally and internationally this will only happen 
with elections 
it is a sentiment shared by the united states which has tied 
renewal of 70 million in aid cut after the election day massacre 
to the holding of legitimate elections 
unfortunately you cant get to democracy without elections 
said us embassy spokeswoman susan clyde only a credibly 
elected government will be able to reform the military and deal 
with financial and lending institutions 
a supreme court judge mrs pascaltrouillot was chosen by a 
coalition of political leaders who organized that mass protests 
that led to avrils ouster 
everyone thought she would be different because she was a 
woman and because the army gave up power to her said ms 
werleigh 
but many political organizations are now clamoring for mrs 
pascaltrouillots resignation and vow to boycott elections if she 
is still in the national palace come november 
the lack of an investigation following the assassination of 
council member serge villard and labor leader jeanmarie montes by 
gunmen wearing army uniforms on june 21 was interpreted by some as 
a clear sign that free and fair elections would be impossible 
we want elections but with security we know danger from the 
past said dr louis roy the main author of the 1987 
constitution and president of the council of state we cant 
continue going backward

this just in us army of imperialist aggression 
continues to support the traitor roh taewoo and his puppet south 
korean government of satanic hooligans 
flashback to the cold war 
no just the world according to communist north koreas official 
news agency where strident near hysterical namecalling of 
longtime enemies remains daily fare and helps keep tension high on 
the korean peninsula 
in the era of glasnost in the soviet union and a crumbling 
socialist world reports from north koreas central news agency 
seem an anachronism final dispatches from the cold war front 
some examples of recent articles from the news agency often 
quoting other north korean media monitored in tokyo 
the official korean roman catholics association was quoted as 
calling seouls arrest of south koreans who traveled to the north a 
human strangulation which can be committed only by satanic 
hooligans without an iota of human reason and national conscience 
the united states which fought with the south against the 
north 40 years ago is the midwife and wirepuller of the dlp the 
governing party in seoul 
gis stationed in south korea are soldiers of the us 
imperialist aggression army 
president roh taewoo of south korea is usually referred to as 
a traitor he is forever up to something sinister 
among the names given his followers are group of heinous 
stranglers of democracy or simply gangsters they pass 
legislation further fascistizing the south korean sociopolitical 
life or they try with bloodshot eyes to obliterate democratic 
forces in the south 
the north korean media were a bit more gracious after roh 
announced last week a proposal to open the border between the rival 
nations he was called the south korean chief executive in 
reports on his proposal but a few days later he was a traitor 
again 
in comparison with the north korean media the few other 
remaining hardline communist nations tend to use language not 
quite so vitriolic 
vietnams media for example are using the once standard us 
imperialists less frequently as hanoi seeks to improve relations 
with washington 
neutral terms such as the government in washington appear as 
frequently as yankee aggression in the official cuban news 
agency prensa latina 
and in communist china staterun media forgo the use of nasty 
adjectives on reports about the rival nationalist chinese 
government on taiwan 
hajime izumi an associate professor at the university of 
shizuoka said he doubts glasnost will reach north korea known 
as one of the most isolated countries in the world any time soon 
a specialist in north korean affairs izumi says the tightly 
controlled pyongyang media prevent the average citizen from knowing 
much about the outside world particularly the more affluent south 
if such information were to become widely available izumi said 
criticism toward the leadership in north korea would increase 
izumi who visited pyongyang twice last year said the strident 
news reports were primarily for domestic consumption 
he said north korean officials told him not to pay much 
attention to the cold war terminology because its main purpose is 
to indoctrinate the countrys own citizens 
but not all is antiamerican antiroh venom on the north korean 
wire 
to show that pyongyang has friends throughout the world there 
are frequent news items on the activities of somewhat obscure 
groups who support the government of president kim ilsung 
among the groups whose study of kims works were mentioned last 
week the conakry embroidery study center of guinea and the group 
of central african youth for the study of kimilsungism

the gap between the rich and poor widened 
during the 1980s while middleincome americans share of all 
income was the lowest in more than 40 years a liberal research 
group says 
the changes were spurred in part by the tax law changes of the 
reagan years according to a report by the center on budget and 
policy priorities a nonprofit research group specializing in 
policy issues affecting the poor 
the report released monday was based on an analysis of recently 
released congressional budget office tax and income statistics 
as a result of shifts in tax burdens and capital gains income 
the center said the richest 1 percent receive nearly as much of 
americans total income after taxes as the bottom 40 percent 
the bottom 40 percent will receive 142 percent of total 
aftertax income received by all groups in 1990 while the top 1 
percent will receive 126 percent 
this marks a sharp change from 1980 when the top 1 percent 
received half as much aftertax income as the bottom 40 percent 
it said 
the center also said census bureau statistics show that the 
share of family income going to the middle 20 percent of americans 
reached a low of 167 percent in 1988 the last year for which 
figures were available the figure was 17 percent in 1947 reached 
a high of 181 percent in 1957 and remained between 17 and 18 
percent through 1984 
robert greenstein executive director of the center said the 
changes were due in part to increased income from capital gains 
received by the wealthy 
the findings he said were an argument against president bushs 
call for a cut in the tax on capital gains 
since the vast bulk of capital gains income goes to the very 
wealthy they would receive most of the benefits from a reduction 
in taxes on capital gains greenstein said 
bush and other advocates of cutting the capital gains tax say it 
would provide an added incentive for people to invest capital in 
jobcreating new and expanded businesses 
the report said the most affluent americans received large 
income gains during the 1980s while middle income people gained 
little and the poor fell behind 
the top 1 percent of the population will receive an expected 
average of more than 175000 in capital gains income in 1990 up 
92000 from what they received in 1980 after adjusting for 
inflation the report said 
by contrast those in the bottom 90 percent are projected to 
receive an average capital gains income of 299 in 1990 up just 
12 over the period it said 
as a result of tax law changes the report said wealthy 
households pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes in 
1990 than they did in 1980 and lower income households pay a 
larger proportion 
the report cited these other congressional statistics comparing 
1980 and 1990 incomes 
average aftertax income of the poorest fifth of households is 
projected to fall 5 percent from 1980 to 1990 after adjustment for 
inflation 
the middle fifth of households will experience a gain in 
aftertax income of less than 3 percent or just 600 
households in the top fifth will realize an average gain of 33 
percent or 19000 
the richest 1 percent will realize income gains after taxes of 
186000 after adjusting for inflation from 214000 to 400000

president bush is moving to stimulate trade 
with the four andean countries of ecuador colombia bolivia and 
peru as part of his proposal for a free trade zone for the western 
hemisphere 
these measures will be steps en route to achieving our 
ultimate objectives of trade and investment liberalization and 
economic reform in the region bush told ecuadorian president 
rodrigo borja in a departure ceremony following their meeting at 
the white house on monday 
the president proposed 
legislation providing dutyfree entry for selected imports from 
the andean region for a transitional period much as was done in 
the caribbean basin initiative approved by congress six years ago 
and now up for extension 
a longterm program of expanded cooperation and technical 
assistance to help latin american countries particularly those in 
the andean region develop their agriculture 
expanding the favorable tariff treatment already given to the 
countries under the generalized system of preferences to include 67 
products ranging from frozen pineapple to wood screws valued at 
266 million a year 
in addition us trade representative carla hills signed a 
framework agreement with ecuador for negotiations of a longterm 
undertaking on liberalized trade and investment similar agreements 
were signed earlier with bolivia and colombia 
the president described the measures as a followup to the 
proposal he made june 27 in which he said he wants to eliminate 
barriers to trade between the united states and the latin and 
caribbean nations 
the ecuadorian president responding to bushs farewell remarks 
expressed thanks for the important statements that mr bush has 
just issued 
we wish to hold the president and the government of these 
people responsible in the future to assist us in their commitment 
to achieve the progress and the wellbeing of latin america and of 
the caribbean nations borja said 
the ecuadoran president spoke in spanish his remarks were 
translated into english by an interpreter 
bernard aronson assistant secretary of state for interamerican 
affairs said bush also told borja that about 3 million in defense 
department equipment and services would be made available to assist 
ecuador in drugsuppression efforts aronson said such equipment 
might include boats aircraft and radios 
aronson said that in selecting additional items for the 
generalized system of preferences the administration is required by 
law to take into account the effect of the action on us 
agricultural and other products 
he said the same principle is expected to be followed in 
drafting the legislation extending the precedent of the caribbean 
basin initiative to the andean countries

just as the bush administration and congress 
are gearing up to fight savings and loan crooks a new study 
indicates that fraud caused only a small percentage of thrift 
losses 
bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria va 
maintains that fraud cost 5 billion or only 3 percent of what he 
figures is the bailouts 147 billion total cost 
most of the losses come from falling real estate values and from 
excessive interest rates paid by ailing institutions to attract 
depositors he figures bad bailout deals made in 1988 and losses 
on junk bonds also contributed 
fraud nevertheless has become the focus of political debate on 
sampls attorney general dick thornburgh making his first 
congressional appearance on the subject and topbanking regulators 
were scheduled to testify on the subject today before the senate 
judiciary committee 
in other thrift news 
the treasury department said monday that the busiest month ever 
for the sampl cleanup helped swell the budget deficit to 112 
billion in june a month when corporate tax payments normally 
produce a surplus 
an attorney representing a gop lobbyist involved in a 
muchcriticized sampl bailout asked the senate ethics committee to 
investigate whether the staff of sen howard m metzenbaum dohio 
struck a sordid deal to share investigative information with 
the new york times 
the judiciary committees hearing came two weeks after the 
senate overwhelmingly adopted a crime bill including gettough 
provisions aimed at bank and thrift fraud 
the bill provides 1625 million in each of the next three years 
to increase the number of prosecutors and fbi agents pursuing sampl 
cases it also increased the maximum prison sentence for bank fraud 
from 20 years to 30 years and provides a special life sentence to 
sampl kingpins they are defined as those who act in concert with 
three others to steal 5 million or more 
similar legislation is moving through the house 
on the witness list today in addition to thornburgh were l 
william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp 
timothy ryan director of the office of thrift supervision and 
john e robson deputy secretary of the treasury 
the 112 billion june federal budget shortfall compared with a 
78 billion surplus in june 1989 brought red ink for the first 
nine months of fiscal 1990 to 1631 billion more than half again 
as much as the 1054 billion deficit at this time last year 
if the deficit continues to accumulate at this pace it could 
top the record deficit of 2211 billion set in 1986 analysts 
attribute the ballooning budget gap to sampl bailout spending and to 
sluggish economic growth which is producing lowerthanexpected 
tax revenues 
bailout spending by the governments resolution trust corp 
totaled 158 billion in june a third of its total spending 
through june of 45 billion eightythree of the rtcs 207 bailouts 
and closings came in june 
attorney stanley m brand representing lobbyist robert j 
thompson a former aide to thenvice president bush asked for a 
probe of what can only be described as a sordid deal to provide 
the senates investigative information to a single newspaper in 
return for favorable coverage on the eve of the senates hearing 
metzenbaum chairs the judiciary subcommittee on antitrust 
monopolies and business rights which is looking into thompsons 
involvement in negotiating the bailout of 15 thrift institutions 
now combined under the name of bluebonnet savings bank of dallas 
the times story on questions surrounding the bailout appeared 
july 8 the day before metzenbaum held a hearing on the subject 
howell raines the times washington bureau chief said as a 
matter of policy we dont discuss sources or the editorial 
process he said the story was meticulously researched from a 
number of sources and was industriously and honorably 
reported 
nancy coffey a spokeswoman for metzenbaum said the senator 
considered brands complaint too ridiculous to comment on 
since when is it against the law for a senator to talk to one 
reporter she asked adding that no prearrangements were 
attached to metzenbaums comments 
meanwhile the times reported in todays editions that thompson 
invested 100000 with a federal regulator paul g heafy who also 
was involved in thompsons negotiations to buy an insolvent bank in 
oklahoma 
the newspaper reported that the investment which was to buy 
distressed loans from federal regulators did not violate conflict 
of interest laws but senate investigators wanted to look into the 
financing of the deal 
heafy is chief liquidator for the federal deposit insurance 
corp in oklahoma city the times said he and thompson refused the 
times requests for interviews

watermelons are getting better easier to 
handle and are making a comeback with consumers the agriculture 
department says 
but thats hard to pin down because the usda which readily 
publishes estimates of many other crops hasnt taken a national 
reading of annual watermelon production for almost a decade 
for many years says the departments economic research service 
the us watermelon industry showed a gradual but persistent 
decline as production slipped from 311 million hundredweight in 
1960 to 261 million in 1981 
that was the last year the department officially estimated 
watermelon production 
although production declined rising prices boosted the farm 
value of watermelons to 1593 million in 1981 several times what 
is was in 1960 
the report in the august issue of farmline magazine said us 
watermelon consumption on a per capita basis dropped to a record 
low of 106 pounds by the 1980s from 172 pounds in 1960 
private researchers meanwhile found that consumers thought 
large watermelons were inconvenient and that quality was not 
consistent some of those perceptions are changing 
the watermelon industry estimates the current farm value of the 
crop at about 225 million with commercial output in about 30 
states production is estimated at more than 3 billion pounds a 
year the equivalent of 150 million 20pound watermelons 
the report said the rebound has been helped by healthconscious 
consumers greater availability of outofseason imports and the 
convenience of smaller ice box melons that can easily fit into 
a refrigerator 
seedless melons and the marketing of small portions in retail 
stores also have been factors the report said 
gary lucier one of the reports authors said monday in a 
telephone interview that 10 states continue to gather and report 
watermelon statistics on their own these produce an estimated 70 
percent of the us total 
florida is the leading producer others include texas 
california georgia south carolina arizona maryland north 
carolina delaware and hawaii 
lucier said usda would like to begin collecting national 
watermelon figures again but that no money is available 
a lot of people would like us to do it but there just isnt 
the budget to do it he said 
a recent study by the center for science in the public interest 
puts nutritional benefits from watermelon ahead of cantaloupe 
papaya orange grapefruit banana or apple 
lucier said the study was based on usda nutritional information 
and noted that a 1inchby10inch slice weighing 482 grams 
supplies 152 calories 77 percent of the recommended daily 
allowance rda of vitamin c and significant percentages of many 
other vitamins and minerals

the agriculture department says it has 
completed another line of defense in texas against africanized 
honeybees moving north out of mexico 
james w glosser head of the departments animal and plant 
health inspection service said monday the bees have not yet 
entered the united states but are expected to do so between late 
summer and next spring 
glosser said four interconnected trap lines have been completed 
in south texas to capture and track swarms as they move north out 
of mexico 
the bees are hybrid offspring of african bees brought to brazil 
in 1956 some escaped and mated with native bees 
africanized bees can be aggressive when threatened and swarm 
quickly against an intruder this characteristic has contributed to 
their notoriety as killer bees which usda officials blame on 
horror movies and exaggerated news reports 
in reality the chances of being injured by an africanized or 
any honeybee are far less than the chances of being hit by 
lightning said a recent background paper on the bees 
glosser said the four trap lines are located north of 
brownsville texas near the gulf coast the northernmost line has 
more than 40 traps and runs about 50 miles from sarita to 
raymondville texas 
an intersecting line has about 60 traps and extends 80 miles 
from la gloria to port mansfield texas on the coast another with 
about 30 traps extends about 30 miles south of la gloria to rio 
grande city the fourth with about 60 traps runs parallel to the 
coast for about 60 miles from san perlita to port isabel texas

gasoline is the dirtiest in seattle and the 
cleanest in miami as far as levels of cancercausing benzene are 
concerned according to a survey by a consumer group 
the survey released monday by citizens action revealed widely 
different levels of toxic aromatics especially benzene in 
gasoline depending on regions of the country 
benzene and other aromatic additives are used to boost gasoline 
octane but they are highly toxic and are of concern to health 
specialists because of motorists exposure to vapors during 
refueling 
the study found that premium gasoline sold in the west generally 
contained higher levels of aromatics including benzene an 
exception appeared to be atlanta where the level of benzene in 
premium gasoline 29 percent was second only to seattle 3 
percent both los angeles and san francisco had benzene levels of 
27 percent on average 
the american petroleum institute representing major oil 
companies said benzene content in gasoline nationwide averaged 16 
percent for regular and 17 percent for premium grades nationwide 
clean air legislation in the final stages of being approved by 
congress calls for refiners to limit their benzene levels to less 
than 1 percent 
shell premium gasoline sold in atlanta had the highest content 
of benzene of any gasoline tested 54 percent exxons premium in 
los angeles and chevrons premium in san francisco all contained 
more than 36 percent benzene 
this is gasoline at its dirtiest said edwin rothschild 
energy policy director for citizen action 
taking into account all 18 cities surveyed chevron had the 
highest average level of benzene 28 percent for premium and 2 
percent for regular 
the api responding to the survey accused citizen action of 
misusing data to present an unduly alarmist picture of the 
health risks to motorists the trade group said exposure levels 
to consumers are too low to pose a danger 
the environmental protection agency has estimated that the 
cancer risk from routine refueling over a lifetime may be eight 
additional cancers per 100000 people exposed the risk is higher 
for those working at service stations or living near them or near 
gasoline refineries the agency said 
api spokesman earl ross called the regional variations not 
unusual gasolines are blended differently for different parts of 
the country he said because of differences in driving 
conditions climate altitude and seasonal changes 
the survey by citizen action a washingtonbased consumer and 
environmental group was based on gasoline samples tested in 18 
cities by the motor vehicle manufacturers association 
the survey found that some gasoline brands already meet the 
anticipated clean air requirement being considered by congress 
in miami where average benzene levels in premium gasoline were 
only 1 percent mobils premium had a benzene level of onehalf of 
1 percent and three other brands union amoco and exxon all 
contained well below 1 percent benzene premium brands by exxon 
amoco and texaco had similar levels in dallas washington dc and 
denver 
but benzene levels varied widely even within single 
manufacturers 
for example texaco sold premium gasoline with 067 percent 
benzene in denver but its regular gasoline sold in boston had 
nearly 5 percent benzene content according to the survey

david souter president bushs candidate for 
the supreme court may prove difficult to challenge because his 
credentials are largely unquestioned and his views on abortion and 
other key litmus test issues are largely unknown 
those may be among his biggest attributes for president bush 
who said in advance that he wasnt looking for a senate 
confirmation fight his choice avoided openly antagonizing either 
side in the raging abortion debate 
liberals are suspicious of the 50yearold souter although they 
have no evidence of what his views are on abortion 
conservatives are hopeful but wary supreme court justices often 
defy predictions about their judicial leanings and the liberal 
whom souter would replace justice william j brennan was 
nominated by a republican president 
souter who was sworn in as a us appeals court judge on april 
30 is so new to the federal bench that he has yet to publish an 
opinion as a new hampshire state supreme court justice before 
that he wasnt called on to rule directly on abortion or many 
other issues that will confront the nations highest court 
bush said he hadnt discussed abortion or other similar issues 
with souter in announcing his intention to nominate him monday he 
praised his keen intellect and legal ability 
thus by nominating the 50yearold new hampshire judge bush 
an opponent of abortion avoided directly confronting either 
advocates or opponents of abortion 
it is not a nomination that immediately will cause a storm of 
opposition said sen paul simon dill like everyone else 
im at this point plowing through some of his decisions 
he cannot be characterized as an ideologue in any way shape 
or form said a friend sen warren rudman rnh 
the senate judiciary committees aim in considering whether to 
recommend confirmation will be to shed some light on souters 
judicial record and views not only on abortion but perhaps on 
affirmative action criminal justice and other issues that divide 
the court 
but like any good political candidate this former state 
attorney general may know that the more he says on controversial 
issues the more votes he stands to lose 
assuming no personal or financial embarrassments are found how 
souter handles questions on those issues will be the key to his 
fate 
members of the judiciary committee will be under pressure to 
find out as much as they can about the man bush nominated on 
abortion and other issues 
abortion rights advocates are demanding that the committee 
confront souter on whether abortion is a constitutionally protected 
right and whether he would overturn roe vs wade 
souters nomination to replace brennan could tip the supreme 
courts balance on abortion and lead to a reversal of the 
17yearold decision that legalized abortion 
a year ago the court allowed greater state restraints on 
abortion a decision with unpredictable political results 
prochoice democrats won several key elections last year in which 
abortion played a role to the consternation of many republicans 
running this year 
bush has made clear he is opposed to abortion and roe vs wade 
but he may not be eager for that political battle before his 1992 
reelection campaign 
even souters friends such as rudman and rep chuck douglas 
rnh who served on the state supreme court with him say they 
dont know what souter thinks about abortion 
we never talked about it douglas said it never came up 
i cant think of a single case that had anything to do with 
abortion while he and i were there 
souters name was not unknown to courtwatchers he was on 
president reagans short list in 1987 when the nomination of 
robert bork brought a monumental senate fight and eventual 
rejection 
national right to life committee strategist doug johnson said 
members of his group have no evidence of souters views on abortion 
but like what they do know 
by the same token abortion rights advocates were uneasy no 
small reason is souters new hampshire connection with white house 
chief of staff john sununu fiercely antiabortion and the right 
wings point man in the administration and the states 
conservative republican senator gordon humphrey 
abortion rights advocates are suspicious about the rapid way 
bush acted too rumors that wellknown rigid conservatives might 
be chosen even the suggestion bush might try bork again may 
have made a lessknown nominee such as souter seem a relief to 
opponents

children would see fewer pitches to buy gi 
joes barbie dolls and sugarcoated breakfast cereals on their 
favorite saturday morning television programs under legislation 
nearing final action in congress 
by voice vote the house on monday approved a bill that would 
limit such ads aimed at children to 12 minutes per hour on weekdays 
and 10 minutes an hour on saturdays and sundays 
the legislation would effectively reverse the reagan 
administrations deregulation of commercial content in childrens 
tv programming in 1984 
a similar bill that would also create a 10 million national 
endowment for childrens education television in the commerce 
department was approved by the senate last week 
the lack of a provision for the endowment in the house version 
is the major difference that must be resolved before the bill can 
go to the white house 
both bills would require regulators to weigh how much 
broadcasters are serving the education needs of children when 
renewing tv stations licenses 
childrens television could and should be the video equivalent 
of textbooks on the classics than the video equivalent of a toys r 
us catalog said rep edward j markey dmass the principal 
author of the house bill 
proponents claim the restrictions are necessary because most 
children are unable to discriminate between ads and programs until 
they reach the age of 4 or 5 and are unable to recognize a sales 
pitch as such until they are 7 or 8 
the house energy and commerce committee estimates the average 
child spends 10000 to 15000 hours in front of a television set 
more time than in school and has been exposed to more than 
200000 tv commercials by the time he or she reaches 18 
nearly identical legislation was approved by congress in 1988 
but was pocketvetoed by president reagan after congress had 
adjourned for the year and had no chance to override it 
the justice department opposed the bill during hearings this 
year and last and said it would urge president bush to veto it 
bush however has made no commitment on the legislation 
i think the president will sign it and i think most of the 
parents will stand behind him when he does said peggy charren 
president of action of childrens television an advocacy group 
behind the legislation 
before the fccs deregulation in 1984 broadcasters had followed 
industry guidelines limiting ads in childrens programming to 9 
minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays 
since then according to the house committee advertising on 
many saturday morning childrens shows has crept up to 11 minutes 
an hour compared with an average of 8 minutes of advertising in 
every hour of adult programming

a key democratic backer of the b2 bomber is 
warning president bush that unless the administration steps up the 
campaign for the stealth aircraft congress will kill it 
the dire prediction by senate armed services chairman sam nunn 
came monday as his house armed services counterpart rep les 
aspin dwis announced he will join an effort to cancel the 
radarevading plane 
the deficit is growing and the defense budget is shrinking 
aspin told reporters prior to his speech on the house floor much 
has happened in the last year and none of it has been good for the 
b2 
congressional support for the costliest weapon in the militarys 
arsenal at more than 800 million a copy has been eroding as 
the soviet threat to the west diminishes and the federal deficit 
and price of a single stealth bomber increases 
the weakening support was the subject of a message sent to bush 
last week by nunn dga and the panels ranking republican john 
warner of virginia 
nunn said late monday that he indicated to the president that 
unless the administration starts lobbying harder for the bomber it 
may fail in the senate 
i thought that before aspin made his statement nunn 
stressed in a telephone interview 
in a statement nunn said he did not believe the b2 can be 
preserved unless the president the secretary of defense the joint 
chiefs of staff and our arms control negotiators all argue 
forcefully for the program 
without this support the senate armed services committee 
position is unlikely to prevail the senator said 
in approving a 289 billion defense bill the armed services 
committee agreed to bushs request for two planes in fiscal 1991 
the full senate is scheduled to consider the legislation later this 
month 
aspin who last year supported limited production of the b2 
cited the cost the planes capabilities and its mission as the 
rationale for his decision aspin said he found no unique and 
compelling mission for the b2 
in april defense secretary dick cheney revised the pentagons 
b2 program trimming the budget request for the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 from five planes to two and cutting the overall 
total from 132 aircraft to 75 
scaling back the plan however increased the cost of a single 
plane from 530 million to 815 million the congressional budget 
office estimated that the cost likely will jump to 865 million 
each with the total programs price tag at 65 billion 
aspin vowed to work for legislation sponsored by his armed 
services colleagues reps ron dellums dcalif john rowland 
rconn and john kasich rohio to stop production at the 15 
planes currently in development by the northrop corp 
proponents of the bill said they have more than the 218 votes 
needed to kill the b2 in the house and dellums proclaimed that 
the full congress will terminate the program 
the more american people see and learn about this weapon 
system the less support there is dellums said so im going to 
stick my neck out and say this is the year that we stop the b2 
bomber 
the white house had no reaction to aspins announcement but air 
force chief of staff gen michael j dugan told reporters at the 
pentagon that aspins voice carries some extra weight and wed 
hoped that we wouldnt have to fight that extra weight 
dugan vowed that the service would step up its lobbying in the 
house for the batwinged aircraft and warned that killing the 
program would send a message to friend and foe alike that the 
united states has lost its stomach for defense 
another proponent of the b2 rep ike skelton dmo urged 
that the bush administration argue a better case for the bomber 
skeltons district includes whiteman air force base where a b2 
wing will be based 
i understand they will be inviting people down to the white 
house soon he said it may be a day late and a dollar short

the flawed mirrors that have crippled the 15 
billion hubble space telescope were a worry for nasa officials even 
as the agency was selecting a contractor for the telescope optics 
according to a 1977 report 
the report released by nasa on monday after a request by the 
associated press said officials selected perkinelmer corp of 
danbury conn to make the hubble optical assembly even though 
the company planned to use an unproven computerdriven system in 
the critical mirror polishing 
engineers for the national aeronautics and space administration 
now believe that a flaw manufactured into one of the mirrors by 
perkinelmer blurred the vision of the hubble telescope reducing 
its effectiveness by at least 50 percent the error is now under 
investigation 
the report signed on aug 26 1977 by thennasa administrator 
robert a frosch said the bid by perkinelmer now hughes danbury 
optical systems inc was preferred over a bid by eastman kodak co 
for several reasons including cost 
officials evaluating the two contract bids rated perkinelmer as 
very good and kodak as good 
our only concern about the perkinelmer approach centers 
around their plan to utilize an asyet unverified 
computercontrolled mirror polishing technique the report said 
it noted however that the concern was alleviated because 
the selection board knew that perkinelmer had other proven and 
reliable techniques that could be used in the event that their 
computer technique is not perfected and verified in time for use on 
the ota optical telescope assembly program 
based upon this information we believe perkinelmer has the 
ability to successfully polish the primary mirror the report 
added 
the report was cosigned by am lovelace deputy nasa 
administrator and john e naugle nasa associate administrator 
one weakness in the perkinelmer proposal the report said was 
the firms unsubstantiated accuracy of focus sensor test 
equipment 
this equipment is among the items impounded by a nasa committee 
that is investigating the manufacture of the hubble mirrors that 
panel led by lew allen director of the jet propulsion laboratory 
is to meet at the manufacturers offices in danbury on wednesday 
perkinelmer sold its optical division to hughes aircraft co 
and the company is now known as hughes danbury optical systems inc 
officials at hughes danbury either declined to be interviewed about 
the nasa report or could not be reached by telephone 
in their 1977 report the nasa officials said the single most 
significant technical discriminator that tilted the selection to 
perkinelmer was the approach used by the connecticut company in 
making a fine guidance sensor the device that is used to aim the 
telescope it said the perkinelmer approach was a cost 
effective design 
the officials also noted that they were quite surprised at the 
large difference in cost favoring perkinelmer in the bids they 
said the kodak proposal on the fine guidance system was three times 
more costly than that of perkinelmer 
perkinelmer was given the hubble contract at about 62 million 
but overruns drove the actual cost up to 451 million by the time 
the telescope was launched from a space shuttle on april 25 
nasa officials concluded in the report that perkinelmer 
clearly won the competition based on mission suitability 
and because the connecticut firm would be the lowest cost 
producer

the man chosen by president bush to be the 
next supreme court justice is being described as a cautious 
conservative an agile thinker and a judge hardly known outside his 
home state of new hampshire 
david h souter who would be the nations 105th justice if 
confirmed by the senate has an extensive record as a state judge 
that reveals little inclination toward sweeping pronouncements or 
rulings 
it would be very surprising if he turned out to be anything 
but a conservative likely to be allied on the high court with 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices antonin scalia and 
anthony m kennedy said university of virginia law professor ae 
dick howard 
preliminary assessments of souters judicial philosophy were 
based less on his writings and rulings than on who his friends and 
political allies are 
souter was a state trial judge for five years before he was 
appointed to the new hampshire supreme court in 1983 by thengov 
john sununu sununu now is bushs chief of staff and considered by 
many to be the leading white house advocate for conservative causes 
souter also has the enthusiastic support of sen warren rudman 
a moderate new hampshire republican 
rudman who as state attorney general years ago hired souter 
once said his protege possesses the most brilliant legal mind 
he had ever encountered 
bush repeatedly said monday he picked souter without examining 
the nominees position on abortion and there is barely a clue as 
to how souter might rule on the issue 
in a 1986 case before the new hampshire supreme court souter 
joined the majority in ruling that doctors have a responsibility to 
test for birth defects and inform pregnant women of the option of 
abortion 
we recognize that the termination of pregnancy involves 
controversial and divisive social issues said the opinion 
nonetheless the supreme court of the united states has held that 
a woman has a constitutionally secured right to terminate a 
pregnancy 
in a concurring opinion souter questioned the impact the 
decision would have on doctors who oppose abortion on moral 
grounds he said such physicians should not have to choose 
between rendering services that they morally condemn and leaving 
their profession in order to escape malpractice exposures 
conservatives and republicans say they are reluctant to jump to 
conclusions without further examination of souters record 
nan aron of the liberal alliance for justice said that based on 
her preliminary soundings souter can be characterized as a 
moderate conservative 
john scully of the conservative washington legal foundation said 
were not celebrating but are optimistic that conservatives 
will be able to rally behind souter 
souter went through senate confirmation hearings when bush named 
him to the 1st us circuit court of appeals earlier this year but 
his experience on the federal bench is so limited that his 
biography is not included in the official directory of federal 
judges 
he is more familiar to legal observers back home 
he does not pay any attention to the emotional political 
aspects of cases before him said stanley m brown a 
manchester nh lawyer and a former american bar association 
officer he doesnt go out blazing new pathways thats not his 
forte 
in an interview published in may in massachusetts lawyers 
weekly souter said he doesnt like being described as a strict 
constructionist 
on constitutional matters i am of the interpretivist 
school he said were not looking for the original 
application were looking for meaning here thats a very 
different thing 
souter was the lone dissenter in a 1985 state supreme court 
decision that struck down the use of police sobriety checkpoints 
the nations highest court upheld such police tactics earlier this 
year 
he also was part of a 32 majority when the state supreme court 
in 1986 allowed the main owner of the seabrook nuclear plant to 
sell bonds needed to complete the longentangled project the court 
rejected appeals by state consumer advocates and environmentalists 
in one of the rare civil rights cases in which souter 
participated he joined the state supreme courts ruling in 1987 
that said homosexuals may be barred from becoming adoptive or 
foster parents but the state court said in that decision that 
homosexuals may not be barred from running day care centers 
people for the american way a liberal group said its review of 
souters state supreme court record indicates he interprets 
constitutional guarantees narrowly especially in criminal cases 
the organization criticized souter for an opinion that 
overturned a sexual assault conviction souter held that the 
defendant should have been allowed to present testimony that the 
victim behaved in a sexually provocative manner toward several men 
in a tavern the group said

david h souter shook hands with president 
bush on monday afternoon for the first time then sat down in the 
white house family quarters for a 45minute chat 
a few hours later bush was introducing souter as his nominee to 
be the next us supreme court justice less than 72 hours after 
william j brennan stepped down from the court 
although his nomination unfolded with surprising speed 
administration officials said that theyve had an eye on souter for 
some time 
shortly after he took office bush asked the justice department 
and white house staff to put together a list of potential supreme 
court nominees souters name was placed on that list early last 
year 
he was bought to the attention of justice department judicial 
candidate screeners by white house chief of staff john sununu said 
a senior administration official as governor of new hampshire 
sununu had appointed souter to that states highest court 
souters name came up again last fall when officials were 
searching for someone to fill a vacancy on the 1st circuit court of 
appeals in boston he underwent a series of interviews last year 
and bush nominated him to that court on jan 24 
after the american bar association gave him its highest rating 
well qualified the senate confirmed souter on april 27 he 
joined the 1st circuit only in may and hasnt had the opportunity 
to publish any rulings 
souters name came up again saturday morning when bush attorney 
general dick thornburgh sununu and white house counsel boyden gray 
met to launch their weekend search for new justice said another 
senior official 
we know this man because we had this man through our judicial 
process last fall said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
at saturdays meeting bush was given background materials on a 
dozen or so potential candidates to study over the weekend 
officials said the president added several names for 
consideration which were given a cursory check by those 
assigned to review the candidates the official said 
white house and justice department officials met throughout the 
weekend 
no short list was drawn up but on monday bush arranged to 
conduct two interviews one with souter and another with a 
candidate whom administration officials declined to identify 
the president talked with souter in the family quarters of the 
white house and later filled three legalsized pages with his 
handwritten feelings or conclusions about the candidate said 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
while souter waited elsewhere in the white house bush weighed 
the strengths and weaknesses of souter and two other 
candidates then wrote out three more pages before making up his 
mind fitzwater said 
after a twohour wait souter was called to the oval office 
where bush offered him the nomination

under the us system of separation of powers 
it is the presidents job to choose supreme court nominees and the 
senates role to confirm or reject them 
twentyseven high court nominees in the nations history have 
failed to win senate confirmation only seven in this century 
most recently the senate in 1987 blocked president reagans 
appointment of robert bork to fill a vacancy created by the 
retirement of justice lewis f powell 
the senate vote was 5842 with six republicans joining 52 
democrats in opposing bork

here is the text of president bushs 
announcement of his intention to nominate david h souter to the 
supreme court 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
my oath to the constitution charges me to faithfully execute the 
office of president and to the best of my ability preserve 
protect and defend the constitution of the united states few 
duties are more important in discharging that obligation than my 
responsibility under article 2 section 2 of our constitution to 
select from among all possible choices one nominee to fill a 
vacancy on the supreme court of the united states 
the task of narrowing the selection to one highly qualified 
jurist committed to the rule of law and faithful to the 
constitution could never be easy but i have found it enormous 
enormously satisfying my choice will serve the court and the 
constitution well 
i am most pleased to announce that i will nominate as associate 
justice of the united states supreme court a remarkable judge of 
keen intellect and the highest ability one whose scholarly 
commitment to the law and whose wealth of experience mark him of 
first rank judge david souter of the united states court of 
appeals for the first circuit 
judge souter i believe with all my heart will prove a most 
worthy member of the court his tenure as an associate justice of 
the supreme court of the state of new hampshire as attorney 
general of that state and more recently as a federal appeals 
judge unquestionably demonstrates his ability his integrity and 
his dedication to public service and he has a keen appreciation of 
the proper judicial role rooted in fundamental belief and 
separation of powers and the democratic principles underlying our 
great system of government 
let me pay tribute too to the justice whose retirement from 
the court created the vacancy justice william brennan his 
powerful intellect his winning personality and importantly his 
commitment to civil discourse on emotional issues that at times 
tempt uncivil voices have made him one of the greatest figures of 
our age 
no one can question his dedication to the nation and the energy 
that he has brought to his high office his retirement is marked by 
the dignity and honor that characterized his 34 years of service on 
the bench and i told him the other day when i talked to him of the 
respect that mrs bush and i have for him for his wonderful service 
in choosing to nominate judge souter who like justice brennan 
is largely a product of the state court system i have looked for 
the same dedication to public service and strength of intellect 
exemplified by justice brennan 
my selection process was not geared simply to any legal issue 
it is not appropriate in choosing a supreme court justice to use 
any litmus test and i want a justice who will ably and fairly 
interpret the law across the range of issues the court faces our 
country serves as a model for the world at a time of special 
significance and i stressed within the white house to the attorney 
general that our process could not be dominated by politics or 
special interests and i believe that weve set a good example of 
selecting a fair arbiter of the law 
judge souter will bring to the court a wealth of judicial 
experience on the supreme court of his state and before that as a 
state trial court judge prior to his appointment to the state 
bench he was attorney general of the state of new hampshire 
judge souter is a graduate of the harvard law school phi beta 
kappa graduate of harvard college he was also a rhodes scholar 
my respect for his outstanding record led me earlier this year 
to nominate him to his present position on the court of appeals 
the senate unanimously confirmed him to that position because of 
his exceptional qualities and his experience 
his opinions reflect a clean intellect keen intellect as well 
as wise balance between the theoretical and practical aspects of 
the law judge souter committed to interpreting not making the 
law he recognizes the proper role of judges in upholding the 
democratic choices of the people through their elected 
representatives with constitutional constraints 
judge brennans retirement took effect last friday the court is 
now reduced to eight members it is important to restore the bench 
to full strength by the first monday in october when the court 
begins its 1990 term i look forward to presenting judge souters 
nomination to the senate as quickly as possible and i look forward 
as well to a fair and expeditious confirmation process

q did you ask judge souter his views on abortion do you know 
what his views are and affirmative action all of these things 
that have become so controversial the major issues of the day 
bush no and i had one meeting with judge souter i was very 
impressed but in my view it would have been inappropriate to ask 
him his views on specific issues this process has been going on 
this selection process not with any specific seat in mind but 
just being prepared for a long long time judge souter was 
considered for the high court back when mr justice kennedy was 
selected and so theres a lot and then of course his name was 
very much in the forefront when he was nominated and subsequently 
confirmed for the appeals court 
so i am familiar with him with his his general views but i 
did not and would not as i think ive said before when i talked 
about not just here but other times the litmus test approach 
i wouldnt go into that with him 
q does that mean you do not care what he thinks on the 
bush it means that i have selected a person who will interpret 
the constitution and in my view not legislate from the federal 
bench 
q mr president barely three days have passed since you 
learned of justice brennans resignation why did you move so 
quickly on this appointment and you also called the leaders of 
congress and others over the weekend for their advice when did 
you come to the choice of justice souter 
bush i came to the choice this afternoon and wanted to i 
think i told the leaders that i talked to over the weekend that i 
wanted to move very fast as i said this isnt precipitous in the 
sense that we just started looking for names last saturday i 
remember meeting with the attorney general and boyden gray perhaps 
within the first month i was president at least the first two 
months and ive had a couple of meetings with them and theyve 
been in discussion with each other for a long time on this and so 
just the prudence would dictate that one be prepared lest there be 
a vacancy so weve been talking about who i might want to appoint 
for a long time 
q sir if i could follow up youre not certain in your own 
mind how justice souter will vote if roe v wade comes before the 
court next term 
bush what im certain of is that he will interpret the 
constitution and not legislate from the federal bench 
yes 
q but mr president i believe judge souter is about 50 years 
old and many of the candidates you considered were younger than 
the current justices what kind of lasting legacy do you want to 
leave on the supreme court do you expect this to be a longterm 
shifting of the center of balance for the court 
bush im not looking hes in good health i was looking over 
there to see how hes looking at 50 but he seems to be in very 
vigorous health and i would expect hed serve a long term on the 
bench and im not viewing this as some personal bush imprint 
on the court i have pledged to get to seek out excellence and 
ive pledged to look for somebody who would interpret the 
constitution and im satisfied ive found the very best in that 
regard 
q do you expect the court would shift to the right 
philosophically 
bush i havent put it in terms of shifting left or right i 
read a great deal of speculation about all that but all im saying 
is that weve got a nominee here who is extraordinarily 
intelligent has a record has been confirmed by the senate and 
who has satisfied inquiry at the state and federal level as to his 
objectivity and as to his judicial philosophy and i am satisfied 
as to all those counts 
q mr president as you know the whole issue of abortion has 
over this choice is major do you know if this judge has written 
on this issue has is he does he have a record on this issue 
that either side can point to to make it an even bigger issue or 
is he is it unknown and therefore more difficult to get at 
bush in the first place i think it would be inappropriate 
although ill let him make up his own mind for justice souter to 
make any comments on any specific issue out of the respect for the 
senate i would urge that he not do that any specific questions on 
specific issues should be addressed in an orderly confirmation 
process by the senate but beyond that lesley i you know i 
think what i said earlier responds to your question 
q no i you said you hadnt asked him but i wonder if he has 
a record if 
bush well i dont know about that i didnt consider that as 
i thought i made clear yeah jerry and then 
q mr president since you concluded that its inappropriate to 
ask about a specific case like roe versus wade do you also 
therefore consider it to be inappropriate for the senate committee 
thatll do the confirmation to ask about a specific case like that 
bush i would let the senate do whatever they want theyre a 
separate and independent body of the of our government and there 
are certain precedents for how they approach these issues but im 
listen ive got enough problems down here without trying to tell 
the senate how to conduct its confirmation hearing ive been 
handed a protocol note marlin fitzwater whos not known for his 
protocol but i he says it would be most appropriate to let judge 
souter respond at this juncture so with your permission well 
proceed 
judge souter thank you mr president im really not sure how 
to do that if it were possible for me to express to you the 
realization that i have of the honor which the president has just 
done me i would try and i would keep you here as long tonight as i 
had to do to get it out but i could not express that realization 
and im not going to try to do the impossible beyond that i hope 
you will understand that i think i must defer any further comments 
of mine until i am before the senate in the confirmation process

q conservatives recently have expressed some disappointment 
with your what they call the flipflop on no new tax pledge 
your position on china lithuania and the like and governor 
sununu is recognized as the champion of the conservatives in the 
white house is his connection is the judges connection to 
governor sununu is this meant as an appeasement to the 
conservative right do you think it will appease them 
bush sununus got problems with his own credentials i mean 
hes not going to help on that and thats not what this is all 
about this matter as ive indicated was there was almost a 
certain recusal on the part of governor sununu on this clearly he 
knows judge souter he has great respect for judge souter but this 
process as im sure boyden gray and dick thornburgh will tell you 
came up through a system excellence came to the top and so 
there is no politics of this nature in this kind of a this kind 
of an appointment if i was looking to shore up one factor or 
another thered be plenty of more visible ways to do it here we 
are talking about excellence judicial excellence and the highest 
degree of qualification based on excellence to be on the court 
q mr president earlier today marlin fitzwater said that 
whomever you chose as your candidate your nominee would reflect 
your general philosophy of government is it still your philosophy 
that roe vs wade the abortion law should be overturned 
bush look you all can keep trying all day long to get me to 
comment on abortion in relation to this nomination and please keep 
stop trying because im not going to respond in that vein it 
would be unfair to judge souter it would be untrue because i 
havent looked at the nomination in that manner and so i simply 
cannot and you get another question though instead 
q well my other question would simply be just not respond in 
the connection with judge souter how about just your own personal 
philosophy 
bush i havent changed my views if that helps any 
q mr president im still not totally certain by why you feel 
it was inappropriate to ask the judges views on the issues 
bush because thats i understand thats the customary way of 
doing it and that more important are the broad concepts of 
excellence is the man qualified does he share a broad view that 
what he ought to do on the bench is interpret the constitution and 
not legislate and so thats all i need and when you see the 
background of this man im confident the senate will share my 
views youre looking for fairness youre looking for equity 
i wrote down a bunch of words to help me make the determination 
and i wish i had them because theyre all along that those lines 
experience and i did say that id like somebody that will 
interpret the constitution not legislate 
q but can you even be sure of that sir does that mean that 
youve at least studied some of his rulings 
bush there has been a great deal of work done in the justice 
department at several levels in our general counsels shop on all 
that kind of thing but again it would be inappropriate to go into 
those cases that he may have ruled on when he was on the state 
court or on the federal bench and i would simply leave that to the 
senate but yes there has been a thorough study of judge souters 
tremendously impressive record 
q mr president given the reality of getting a person 
confirmed to the supreme court these days are you braced for a big 
battle 
bush well i dont im not going into this nomination or 
thrusting judge souter into the nomination expecting a highly 
contentious battle the man was confirmed by the senate 
unanimously and after testimony so im not suggesting theres 
going to have to be or should be i remember calmer days when there 
werent so i would not anticipate a contentious battle i would 
anticipate thorough questioning i would anticipate each senator 
having enough information to make up his or her mind based on the 
record or responses to questions but no im not were not 
bracing for some horrendous fight with the united states senate 
and given his record i would expect that the chances of that are 
minimal

q do you think a president these days has to do more of a 
selling job than in the past 
bush i dont know maureen i dont think so if the record 
speaks for itself if id have selected somebody out of the 
political arena that had never been on the bench and never had any 
experience but was in my view well qualified there might well have 
been more intervention on my part im prepared to do whatever is 
appropriate in not only defending but advocating this confirmation 
but i dont believe theres going to be a lot of personal 
involvement necessary because i think his record and his standing 
will speak for itself 
yes 
q mr president ive got to make one more try you say its 
inappropriate to ask but you also admit there is a lot of 
background paperwork on someone judge souter was appointed to the 
new hampshire court by governor sununu whose feelings on abortion 
are well known your feelings on abortion are well known why 
should we not believe that that is a factor in your selection 
bush because ive told you its not and because you ought to 
listen to the testimony in the hill and then you can make up your 
mind better when youve seen the evidence and that i expect 
people will be raising this question ive seen a lot of 
speculation on it over the last 48 hours or whatever it was since 
justice brennan retired but im telling you you asked me what my 
view was and ive told you how i approach this matter and thats 
all i can do 
yes 
q mr president you said a moment ago that there are senate 
precedents on how questioning happens in the judiciary committee 
in fact there are two very contrasting precedents there was the 
bork precedent where the nominee answered all sorts of questions 
and there was the justice oconnorjustice kennedy precedent in 
which the nominee declined to an lot of specific questions about 
how the nominee felt do you have any preference about how your 
nominee handles these questions 
bush no but i have confidence my nominee will handle it 
properly and hes look the man is a judge on an appeals court 
he knows how to treat with this and the senate is a free senate 
and they know how to treat with it so that im not going to get 
into that i think its inappropriate for a president to do that 
kind of thing 
q do you tts appropriate for a nominee to answer specific 
questions about how he might rule on 
bush i would leave and let the senate make the final 
determination 
yes were there one or two aspects of the judges background 
that alifications that particularly brought him to th bush being 
bright extraordinarily bright and then a record foess 
extraordinarily fair well ive made my judgment based youve 
asked me what i decided ifications that i think are essential plus 
i gave you the underpinning which i want somebody that is not 
going to be a legislator sitting on the supreme court 
yeah and then ann 
q did you meet judge souter before you made this decision other 
than the last couple of days 
bush yes just within the last couple of days 
q the first time youve ever seen him 
bush first time id met him and who knows the amouni spent in 
new hampshire i might well have seen him but i laughter weve 
been as i have indicated been talking to our attorney general and 
boyden gray on resumes or on records for a long long time and 
the man is very highly regarded so but i no i just had a 
short visit with judge souter today and obviously was quite 
impressed 
yes ann 
q you had already decided at that point sir 
bush no i had not decided and thats the truth as is 
everything else i said here laughter yeah q in in speaking 
to your advisors about resumes and records as you say did you ask 
your advisors to produce only nominees who had no extensive written 
record on the abortion issue 
bush no 
q that inaudible more candidates who would not provoke 
a large debate over 
bush no 
yeah owen 
q i wonder if you can you tell me how is it possible to make 
the selection without reviewing the judges record or a summary of 
his record that dealt with sic cases if not abortion affirmative 
action civil rights issues free speech a lot of the emotional 
issues that the country is very concerned about 
bush most of hve been at the state level and the the i made 
the decision based on the criteria that i gave you 
q so youre telling us that you have no idea what his judicial 
opinions are on abortion affirmative action and civil rights flag 
burning 
bush im telling you that you should stay tuned and let the 
testimony before the united states senate determine whether hes 
confirmed or not and that that ll bring out all the questions that 
youre aski and the answers thats up to the judge to see how he 
should hhat as one who is going to have to deal with a lot of 
issues in future 
yeah 
q mr president has gnor sununu who is well acquainted with 
the nominee given you reading on the judges views on 
controversial issues 
bush no theres no no 
way in the back 
q inaudible 
q am i

bush one two three and then im leaving 
q i wonder if you could tell me sir you extolled the judges 
virtues and pointed out more than once that he was unanimously 
confirmed by the senate for his present position can you think of 
any reason any possibility the senate would not confirm the judge 
for this post 
bush no 
q other than ideological grounds 
bush i can think of none why they would not confirm him none 
period 
q and would you object strenuously to a confirmation battle 
over ideological grounds 
bush look ive nothing to say about that this is a separate 
body i dont control the senate i would hope they would accept 
the when theyve had a chance to ask questions and theyve had a 
chance to review his record would conclude as i have that he is 
outstandingly wellqualified for the federal bench a judgment that 
was given to him not too long ago by the aba itself 
wellqualified which i gather is the highest rating a judge can 
have 
q you had said youre not interested in making a bush imprint 
on the court you may also be 
bush i have to i guess but im not interested in having this 
known as a bush court or something of that nature 
q well you may be called upon throughout your term to actually 
name one or two others do you have those in mind and also if 
bush yes 
q by having those names in mind of who you would appoint are 
you doing the same thing like in foreign policy saying that you 
want to choose a prudent man or that the imprint would be something 
peculiar to you in other words a 
bush look ill tell you how i look at this not in terms of 
some specific imprint but i want it said when im about lets 
see 66 about 90 24 years from now that i made a superb choice 
and i think it will be so writ 
q mr president id like to ask you about the phrase youre 
using on youre opposed to somebody who would legislate from the 
bench youre on record as wanting roe vs wade overturned youre 
on record as favoring a flagburning amendment to the constitution 
arent those sorts of issues tantamount to legislating from the 
bench as well 
bush well what youd have to tell me the case and advise me 
as to how i dont think so i dont think when called upon to 
answer a constitutional question that that has to be legislating 
from the bench 
q but you would not be upset if the court overturned roe vs 
wade 
bush no 
q or if the court upheld the flagburning amendment 
bush no and a lot of other things too i believe in the 
separation of powers i happen to think that theres been a many 
many things have troubled me encroachment of micromanagement by 
the united states congress on the presidency but i havent asked 
this able judge about those things but i could cite you cite 
two you cite one thats been on everybodys lips ever since i 
since justice brennan retired listen i never heard such coverage 
on the television you might just think the whole nomination had 
something to do with abortion and its far broader than that i 
have too much respect for the supreme court than to look at one 
specific issue and one alone ive got time for one yeah kathy 
q mr president theres been some speculation you might name 
an hispanic this time and make history in doing so you went a 
different route what do you say to those who might be disappointed 
that didnt happen and what is the likelihood you might name an 
hispanic should another vacancy develop 
bush first i say to whoever it is that inquires ive made the 
best choice i possibly could make in terms of qualifications 
ability background and temperament to serve on this court and 
then i say look the great thing about this country is you can 
achieve anything and theres a lot of time down the road in which 
im sure youll see a different makeup on the court but i dont 
im not going to deal in any one specific group visavis another 
one and thats what i would say but i just would ask the american 
people to understand i looked at a wide array of names prior to my 
getting into it in as much depth as i have very recently the 
attorney general his staff boyden gray and his staff went 
through this process its a continuance its a process thats 
been going on for some time and this the excellence was just 
there at the top and so i would not cite this as something 
discouraging for anybody that aspires to the supreme court or any 
group that would aspire to have representation on the supreme 
court listen i really do have to go 
q what did you ask him when you interviewed him 
q did you interview the other finalists mr president did he 
win in the interview 
bush he did very very well 
q two or three 
bush yeah let me get one ive been i failed to 
q two or three of the candidates that were mentioned were from 
your home state and there was talk that you perhaps would choose 
somebody from the south because you felt the south was in 
underrepresentation since justice powell resigned wasnt anybody 
qualified in the south or why did you 
bush no theres plenty of people qualified and you raise a 
good point because there arent there is nobody from the what i 
would call the southeast conference south but the south excluding 
texas that that is on the bench now and theres about a quarter 
of the people from there so this is a consideration and was a 
consideration it was forcefully brought home to me by key members 
of congress and yet i determined that judge souter given the 
qualifications ive tried to extoll here the virtues is the 
choice for the federal for the supreme court at this time 
but no these calls are not easy and kathy asked about 
different ethnic groups you asked about regional distribution and 
i think one considers all these all these criteria i think its 
fair to say that new england which is not represented on the bench 
now that justice brennan is retired might look at it if i had 
gone with another nominee as why were they excluded so i can 
understand regionalism but please believe me as a proud texan i 
tried to look at it on a in a national sense and i think ive 
come up with the best nominee jesse im sorry to disappoint you 
q a very quick followup if i could senator simpson suggested 
that you follow the counsel of mrs bush did you in any way on 
this particular issue 
bush how did he know he doesnt even know who i nominated how 
could he have said that 
q he said that he hoped that that would be what you would do 
bush oh i see wonderful fellow al

minnesota which last voted for a republican 
presidential candidate in 1972 has a new conservative think tank 
aimed at challenging liberals on their own turf 
the center of the american experiment may seem out of place in 
the land of prairie liberalism its founder says thats the point 
we are purposely going after the most difficult the nastiest 
issues we face as a state and as a nation said mitchell 
pearlstein the centers founder and president 
the center opened in march and held its first conference on 
poverty in april a conference titled what do we do when school 
reform fails is scheduled for nov 16 the center plans to 
publish papers hold more forums and deliver recommendations on 
such issues as drugs welfare and taxes 
minnesota is where hubert h humphrey and his protege walter f 
mondale got their start in politics 
it is the only state to vote for democratic candidates in all 
three presidential races in the 1980s richard nixon was the last 
republican to carry minnesota when he defeated george mcgovern in 
1972 
conservative ideas are not terribly well attended to in this 
state in part because theyre not terribly well articulated 
pearlstein said you can say that the niche is that much larger 
pearlstein 42 had another reason for establishing the center 
in minnesota he wanted to come home 
a former speechwriter for gov al quie in 198182 then 
editorial page writer for what is now the saint paul pioneer press 
he left for washington in 1987 to work for the education 
department but pearlstein who grew up in far rockaway ny and 
later moved to binghamton ny longed for minnesota 
i tell people about 20 minutes after getting to washington i 
started to conspire to return home he said this is literally 
where i want to die 
the center is nonpartisan but most of its 12 directors and 16 
advisers are republicans two democrats have joined the board of 
advisers and more democrats will be added pearlstein said 
republican sens dave durenberger and rudy boschwitz are on the 
board of advisers 
five members of the boards of directors and advisers are black 
or hispanic and five are women 
we have very much an interest in changing the imagery of 
conservatives as a very white male idea pearlstein said 
rep vin weber a republican on the board of advisers believes 
the time is right for a conservative think tank in minnesota 
i think activist states will find their successes copied 
around the country weber said so if the center is successful 
in formulating some new responses to old problems in minnesota 
theyre in a significant moment in history to have a significant 
national impact 
former st paul mayor george latimer a liberal said he 
welcomes any fresh approach to social problems but was disappointed 
after the centers conference on poverty 
i saw them trotting in a lot of people who have published 
their ideological tracts they brought out their conservative 
hispanic their conservative black their conservative 
intellectual latimer said 
they were not listening they were being ideologues 
pearlstein is the only fulltime staff member at the center 
which has a firstyear budget of 250000 funding comes from 
individuals corporations and foundations he said adding there 
are no plans to take government money

supreme court nominee david h souter is a 
quiet hardworking judge who lives an almost monastic life but 
can skewer stuffed shirts with his sharp sense of humor friends 
say 
friends colleagues and lawyers who know souter 50 described 
him as an intellectual and a man with a deep respect for the 
constitution president bush nominated him monday to replace 
retired justice william j brennan 
i dont think the president could have nominated a person with 
better qualities background a keener intellect than david 
souter sen warren rudman rnh a close friend said monday 
souter moved to weare nh from the boston suburb of melrose 
at age 11 he has never married and still lives alone on the family 
farm where he grew up 
he has a small circle of very good friends and lives an almost 
monastic life said rudman who first recommended souter for the 
high court when president reagan was unable to get robert bork 
confirmed in 1987 
if he has any fault i believe its that hes worked too hard 
all his life but thats the way he is rudman said 
tom rath who replaced souter as state attorney general and also 
is a close friend said souter enjoys hiking and reading 
his voracious appetite for books shows in his farmhouse which 
he said once in an interview looks as though someone is moving a 
bookstore and has stopped 
despite souters quiet conservative appearance he has a 
wicked sense of humor that can skewer the most stuffed shirt 
rath says 
souter has left rural weare only to attend harvard college and 
oxford where he was a rhodes scholar and harvard law school from 
which he was graduated in 1966 
as a law student souter was a resident adviser in a freshman 
dorm at the college where his charges included chase g 
untermeyer now white house personnel director 
souter could give the impression with the movement of an eye 
and the slightest inclination of his head that he was catching 
everything that goes on which is exactly the type of person you 
want watching over a freshman dorm untermeyer said monday 
after graduating from law school souter went into private 
practice for two years named an assistant state attorney general 
in 1968 he became deputy and then attorney general in 1976 
archconservative gov meldrim thomson made him a superior court 
judge in 1978 and thengov john sununu now white house chief of 
staff elevated him to the state supreme court in 1983 
in april souter won confirmation to the 1st us circuit court 
of appeals in boston where he began work in june 
if confirmed souter would be the supreme courts 105th justice 
he would be its sixth bachelor the first new englander since felix 
frankfurter retired in 1962 and the second rhodes scholar joining 
justice byron r white 
though friends recall him driving rusting aging cars and 
living a less than extravagant lifestyle souter had a net worth of 
621000 at the end of 1989 including 191000 in personal 
property 190000 in securities and 150000 in real estate 
according to financial records released monday he listed no 
liabilities 
some immediately challenged the selection elliott berry a new 
hampshire legal assistance lawyer voiced reservations about how 
souter would treat the disenfranchised 
his overall philosophy tends to result in support for the 
status quo berry said 
but he was praised by ellen musinsky who teaches family law at 
franklin pierce law center in concord and who appeared before 
souter often when he was a trial judge though she frequently 
disagrees with souter she said she respects him 
a lot of the male judges were not real pleasant to practice in 
front of but he was great she said he was nice he respected 
me he made me feel like if i had done my work which i did id 
get a very fair shot he was delightful

a rotary club chapter has made its own aids 
documentary for distribution to 24000 chapters worldwide that 
chronicles the lives of three rotarians affected by the deadly 
disease 
our idea is to change the attitude in wichita kansas said 
dick hasenpflug chairman of the rotary aids project of the los 
altos rotary club 
dushan angius challenged the rotary club to get involved in aids 
education last summer when he told the group his son steve had 
aids 
when a son tells you he has aids all you hear is gee dad 
im going to die theres no way i could let it go that way 
angius said 
the documentary scheduled to be shown to the media today 
eventually will be distributed to 24000 rotary clubs worldwide 
hasenpflug said 
rotarians around the world tend to be leaders in their 
communities and we think the rotarian network gives a unique 
opportunity to make an impact on community thinking he said 
the film initially was going to feature steve angiuss story 
alone but as word of the project spread two rotary club members 
publicly acknowledged that they tested positive for the aids virus 
greg betts president of the bayshore rotary club in neighboring 
palo alto volunteered to appear in the film 
walter singer a 67yearold retired businessman went one step 
further he allowed crews to film the meeting in december when he 
told the los altos rotary club how he contracted the aids virus in 
a blood transfusion during heart bypass surgery 
it was an individual reaction sort of a gasp hasenpflug 
said it was dead silent a lot of hugging and holding all of 
these things you dont expect a lot of 60yearold men to be 
doing 
singer said the courage of the angius family and the public 
support they received persuaded him to go public 
the rotarians are not exempt which they thought they were 
singer said 
the local rotary clubs involvement with aids is a departure for 
the conservative organization that usually avoids politically 
controversial subjects hasenpflug said 
we believe strongly that the aids project transcends 
politics hasenpflug said the political part of it is how 
people catch it and in my opinion how people catch it is 
irrelevant once they catch it people need our support 
hasenpflug describes the film as a very powerful piece that 
avoids presenting facts about the disease and instead focuses on 
the impact aids has on individuals 
on the first day of shooting crews filmed steve angius asking 
his family to take him to the hospital he died the next day nov 
25 
grown men cry when they watch this thing hasenpflug said

us military experts arrived in 
cambodia today to examine what may be the remains of americas 
wartime missing the first such mission since the 1975 communist 
takeover 
the sixman team including two forensic scientists flew from 
bangkok thailand in a us air force c141 jet transport 
the us delegation shook hands awkwardly with a group of 
midlevel cambodian officials then drove into phnom penh where 
they spent an hour touring the city before meetings with cambodian 
officials 
on wednesday they are to examine remains collected by the 
cambodians if it appears the remains may be those of american 
servicemen they are to be removed to the united states for further 
examination and identification 
the united states still does not recognize the 
vietnameseinstalled phnom penh government on wednesday however 
it announced it was withdrawing recognition of the guerrilla 
coalition battling the government in order to open talks with 
vietnam on ending the countrys civil war 
us state department spokesman richard boucher said on july 13 
that todays mission would be strictly humanitarian and have no 
political intent american officials have complained that the 
cambodians postponed repatriation of remains in order to exact 
political concessions from the united states 
the visiting team is from the joint casualty resolution center 
and the army central identification laboratory hawaiibased 
agencies that try to account for us military personnel listed as 
missing in action in the indochina conflict 
it is led by lt col joe harvey head of the resolution center 
harvey said on arrival in phnom penh that he came only to view 
the remains and the issue of normalized relations between cambodia 
and the united states definitely is not on the agenda 
in bangkok team spokesman lt col thomas boyd said that if the 
remains are identified as those of americans a 17member team will 
fly to phnom penh thursday for a military honors ceremony the 
remains would be flown to hawaii 
boyd said he did not know how many sets of remains the team will 
examine 
a total of 2299 americans are officially listed as missing in 
action in indochina of those 1678 are missing in vietnam 533 in 
laos and six in chinas coastal waters 
of the 82 missing in cambodia most are airmen whose planes were 
downed during strikes on the ho chi minh trail in eastern areas 
that north vietnam used to infiltrate men and supplies into south 
vietnam 
us airplanes heavily bombed the country from 1969 until 1973 
us officials have said there also are at least eight civilians 
missing in cambodia including four journalists two contractors a 
merchant seaman and a missionary 
the khmer rouge toppled the usbacked lon nol government in 
april 1975 sending the american ambassador fleeing over the next 
four years the khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of 
cambodians as it tried to turn the country into an agrarian commune 
the vietnamese invasion of late 1978 ousted the khmer rouge and 
installed a new communist government in phnom penh the khmer rouge 
then joined two noncommunist groups in a guerrilla coalition 
backed by china and many other countries 
earlier this month john gunther dean the last us ambassador 
to cambodia made a sixday visit to phnom penh his first since 
carrying out the us flag during the 1975 evacuation 
phnom penh said in 1984 that it was willing to cooperate on the 
issue of missing americans and declared in 1988 it was willing to 
hand over remains but the repatriations had been delayed by the 
diplomatic stalemate 
prime minister hun sen was quoted as saying in february 1989 
that his government had eight sets of american remains and was 
searching for more 
last month the cambodian government said it had set up a 
fiveman commission chaired by a deputy minister to help search for 
the remains of us servicemen

a soldier the army charged with murder 
in the slaying of a man in civilian clothes during the us 
invasion of panama says he is worried that politics will prevent 
him from getting a fair trial 
if im found innocent the department of army will look bad 
said 1st sgt roberto e bryan an 82nd airborne division 
paratrooper and 19year army veteran 
bryan is charged with unpremeditated murder and faces a maximum 
life prison sentence if convicted he says he was merely performing 
his duty in the heat of battle and that he has enough evidence to 
be acquitted 
where im concerned is the political issue i have to keep my 
eyes open so they dont use command influence in the trial he 
said 
an army spokeswoman said bryans fears were unfounded 
as far as getting a fair trial thats the purpose of a trial 
by courtmartial staff sgt cindy darst a spokeswoman for the 
18th airborne corps the umbrella command of the 82nd airborne 
said monday 
the army alleges bryan shot a panamanian man without provocation 
on dec 23 1989 three days after the united states began the 
invasion that toppled dictator manuel noriega from power 
the shooting occurred during a barrage of gunfire that erupted 
when a panamanian tossed a hand grenade that wounded 10 soldiers at 
a roadblock 
bryans battalion and brigade commanders recommended dismissal 
of the murder charge an officer who conducted an article 32 
investigation similar those conducted by civilian grand juries 
reduced the original premeditated murder charge to voluntary 
manslaughter 
that charge was upgraded to unpremeditated murder the military 
equivalent of seconddegree murder by lt gen gary e luck 18th 
airborne commander i was basically convicted before the 
article 32 investigation said bryan referring to a march report 
in the army times newspaper that quoted unnamed army sources as 
saying bryan killed a wounded panamanian prisoner attempting to 
surrender 
publicity is the reason it has gone this far said mark l 
waple bryans attorney the army does not want to face criticism 
from the media or congress 
bryan and other soldiers at the roadblock said the wounded man 
did not attempt to surrender and prompted gunfire at him by moving 
suddenly like he was reaching for a weapon bryan said the body 
was not searched and it is not known if the man was armed no 
autopsy was performed army officials said 
five panamanians wearing civilian clothes were ordered out of 
a vehicle so it could be searched 
members of noriegas panamanian defense force and his dignity 
battalions were known to wear civilian clothes 
a search of the vehicle produced a tear gas grenade a machete 
and an unfired rifle cartridge the panamanians were ordered to lie 
on the ground and soon afterward a hand grenade exploded 
witnesses said many soldiers fired at the panamanians 
bryan said he was about 70 yards from the roadblock when he 
heard the grenade explode 
he said he ran to the highway and told the men to cease firing 
four of the five panamanians were killed bryan said 
it was chaos he said i saw the man make an arm movement 
like he was reaching for something but how do they know the 
bullets i fired killed him when i opened up everybody else opened 
fire in that direction again 
at least three other us soldiers have been prosecuted for 
their actions during the panama invasion 
one was convicted of unpremeditated murder and two others were 
found guilty of lesser charges after a firefight investigators said 
was staged to cover up a soldiers loss of his handgun at a bar

after a little prodding from a wellheeled health 
crusader the nations top four hamburger chains agree french fry 
lovers need an oil change 
mcdonalds corp and wendys international announced monday they 
are switching to cholesterolfree allvegetable oil to cook their 
fries 
hardees made the change two years ago and burger king said last 
week it will no longer use beef tallow the industrys previous 
standard oil for french fry vats 
everything thats deep fried is now done in 100 percent 
cholesterolfree oil said mcdonalds spokesman chuck rubner the 
company started cooking its chicken items pies and fish in 
vegetable oil four years ago he said 
mcdonalds has been a target of newspaper and tv ads placed by 
anticholesterol crusader phil sokolof who accused the worlds 
largest restaurant chain of poisoning americans with fatty foods 
sokolof said a recent advertising agegallup organization poll 
indicated a significant number of people responded to his ads by 
shying away from fastfood outlets 
consumers have the power to move mountains and thats what 
they did he said in a telephone interview after the mcdonalds 
announcement we obviously speeded up the process 
thats really ridiculous countered mcdonalds spokeswoman 
terri capatosto weve been in the nutrition business a lot 
longer than mr sokolof has been in the ad business 
rubner said mcdonalds has been experimenting with using 
vegetable oil for eight years and that test marketing in 500 
restaurants began in october 
clearly the challenge that we were looking at was to maintain 
the same taste the worldwide favorite while at the same time 
improving the nutritional value said rubner 
sokolof a 66yearold millionaire from omaha neb blames a 
highcholesterol diet for a nearfatal heart attack 22 years ago 
in april sokolof placed ads headlined the poisoning of 
america in several major us newspapers the ads criticized 
mcdonalds and other restaurants for cooking foods in beef tallow 
rather than using hearthealthy oils 
mcdonalds warned newspapers against printing sokolofs ads 
contending they were inaccurate 
on july 3 sokolof placed ads aimed specifically at mcdonalds 
mcdonalds new french fry oil expected to be in use nationwide 
by the end of the year is a combination of corn and cottonseed oil 
the company said the new cooking oil will be cholesterolfree 
and result in a 45 percent reduction in saturated fat content for 
a regularsize order of fries rubner said saturated fat will go 
from 505 grams to 27 grams 
wendys vice president charlie rath said the companys change 
drops the cholesterol in a 32ounce french fry serving from 15 
milligrams to a trace and reduces saturated fat by 20 percent from 
15 grams to 12 grams 
vegetable oils dont contain cholesterol but certain kinds of 
vegetable oils contain saturated fats which the body converts to 
cholesterol thus eating cholesterolfree food doesnt 
necessarily protect a person from cholesterol 
doctors advocate food cooked in polyunsaturated fat or 
monounsaturated fat found in corn sunflower and other oils 
vegetable oils to avoid are palm and coconut 
rubner said mcdonalds has a market share that exceeds that of 
hardees burger king and wendys combined sales by mcdonalds 
franchisees and companyowned stores totaled 46 billion for the 
second quarter of this year 
two other fastfood rivals arbys and kentucky fried chicken 
already fry their food in vegetable oils

by the narrowest of margins parliament 
today ratified a defense treaty with the united states that will 
allow two american bases to remain on crete for at least eight more 
years 
the treaty which guarantees us help if greece is attacked 
has been a divisive issue in greek politics and hundreds of 
antibase demonstrators clashed with police on monday near the city 
of khania on crete three policemen were reported slightly injured 
after being shot by demonstrators 
the parliamentary approval early today ended more than 18 months 
of uncertainty about the future of the bases 
the previous defense treaty expired in december 1988 but was 
extended as negotiations continued through several changes of 
government in greece 
a simple majority of the 300member parliament was required for 
ratification which came after three days of debate 
conservative politicians support a continued us military 
presence but leftists demand the removal of the bases 
the pact takes effect in september and runs through 1998 
a state department official requesting anonymity said late 
monday that the united states considers the pact an executive 
agreement which would not require ratification by congress 
the treaty allows the united states to continue operating two 
major military bases on the island of crete a naval support 
facility at souda bay and iraklion air station near the village of 
gournes 
two bases near athens a navy communications station at nea 
makri and the hellenikon air base have been slated for closing by 
the defense department as a costcutting measure 
numerous relay stations throughout greece also will close 
the treaty continues a defense relationship between the nato 
allies that began in 1953 
the us administration has also agreed to seek congressional 
approval for an aid package that would provide greece with about 
345 million in assistance to buy us military equipment supply 
surplus planes and destroyers worth about 1 billion and write off 
about 50 million in past debts for military purchases 
all 151 deputies from the governing conservative new democratic 
party voted in favor of the treaty it was opposed by 144 
communist socialist and environmentalist deputies four deputies 
were absent and one abstained 
uunder the socialist government of premier andreas papandreou 
17 rounds of talks on a new bases treaty proved fruitless 
the talks were put on hold last year when coalition governments 
held power on april 8 the conservative government was elected 
the united states reached agreement in principle on may 30 after 
two rounds of talks 
on crete a coalition of leftist groups opposed to the us 
bases staged demonstrations in khania on monday night as many as 
2500 people took part in the protests according to witnesses and 
journalists 
police fired tear gas to prevent demonstrators from entering a 
municipal building to deliver a petition the public order ministry 
said 
clashes then broke out and three police officers suffered 
gunshot wounds the ministry said another five officers were 
injured by gasoline bombs and stones hurled by demonstrators it 
said 
a hospital source said 10 civilians were treated for respiratory 
problems caused by the tear bas and another 40 people received 
treatment for minor injuries a police official in khania said 
eight people were arrested during the disturbances

communist party candidates fighting 
to extend 70 years of rule defeated most of the opposition slate in 
the initial round of mongolias first multiparty elections the 
government said today 
preliminary results from sundays primary indicated that just 96 
of 300 candidates from the five opposition parties survived prime 
minister sharavyn gunjaadorg said 
the balloting was to reduce the field of 2400 candidates to 
860 two for each seat in the national legislature or great 
peoples hural the final round of voting is sunday 
gunjaadorg maintained that a communist victory would not hinder 
mongolias dramatic transformation which began in december from 
an authoritarian oneparty state obedient to moscow to a 
multiparty nation eager for western contact and investment 
he said the noncommunist parties would still have some 
possibility to get into power 
the oppositions only hope for gaining a significant voice in 
government lies in the 53seat small hural which will handle 
legislation between annual sessions of the great hural 
its seats will be assigned to the various parties according to 
the percentage of the vote each receives 
even a communistcontrolled great hural would be very different 
from its predecessor however because most of the partys 
candidates this time are intellectuals and bureacrats rather than 
herders and workers as in the past 
the election process so far is a comparatively free and fair 
one gunjaadorg told a news conference 
of course since we are exercising this kind of election for 
the first time there are some shortcomings and some bumps he 
said 
nineteen foreign observers are in town from the soviet union 
united states poland and britain a source in the capital who 
spoke on condition of anonymity visited 10 polling stations in the 
city and described the voting as very well organized 
mongolia is especially eager that the election be perceived as 
fair because secretary of state james a baker iii is scheduled to 
visit next week and discuss extending mostfavored nation trade 
status to mongolia 
mongolias ambassador to the united states nyamdoo said the 
state department did not confirm bakers trip until the opposition 
parties dropped a threat to boycott the election 
opposition nominees had been far outnumbered at the start with 
the communists fielding nearly 2100 candidates the opposition 
acknowledged early on that it had no hope of controlling the great 
hural 
formed only over the past few months the five noncommunist 
parties claim a combined membership of about 12000 to the ruling 
partys 98000 they have only a fraction of its financial assets 
and no daily media outlet 
although they appear to have substantial support in cities 
where half of mongolias 2 million people live the oppositionists 
have had to scramble to spread word of their programs to the rural 
people 
many of those people are seminomadic herders only dimly aware 
of the large demonstrations in ulan bator that began in december 
and forced the communists to agree to elections they know even 
less of the anticommunist revolutions in eastern europe that 
inspired mongolias opposition 
in the great hural one seat has been allocated for every 2000 
rural residents and every 10000 urban residents hurting the 
citybased opposition 
in recent months the communists have embraced many of the goals 
of the opposition including its demand for marketstyle economic 
reforms decreased reliance on the soviet union and a revival of 
traditional culture 
gunjaadorg said the government is drafting legislation to define 
the role of private and cooperative ownership in the economy in 
which now almost all enterprises are stateowned 
however he indicated private ownership would be restricted to 
agriculture the service sector and smallscale industries 
other parties including the national progressive party have 
called for bolder privatization 
the largest opposition party the mongolian democratic party 
says the communists are incapable of reform and seek only to stay 
in power 
mongolia has been ruled by the communists since 1921 when a 
small band of revolutionaries aided by soviet troops drove out the 
chinese who had controlled mongolia since 1691 
china retained southern mongolia called inner mongolia where 
mongolian tribal princes had formed alliances with the chinese

the condemned man had a metal strainer 
for a head a vat of salty water for a body and piece of pipe for a 
leg engineers testing the states electric chair said he died 
quickly 
but attorneys trying to win reprieves for florida death row 
inmates after flames jumped from electrodes strapped to a 
prisoners head in a recent execution say they were unimpressed 
with the unusual test monday 
a series of tests were ordered by gov bob martinez after the 
botched may 4 electrocution of jesse tafero 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals has blocked several 
scheduled executions because of questions raised by defense 
attorneys about the effectiveness of the chair 
the makeshift inmate was jolted with current during the 
15minute demonstration which caused a noisy buzzing the test 
showed the chair was putting out 2000 volts and 10 to 11 amps 
the electric chair works as it is supposed to said mike 
morse an associate professor of electrical engineering at auburn 
university we see no indication of smoke arcing or burning 
the test carried out in the death chamber at florida state 
prison was viewed by news reporters state officials 
representatives of the general electric co and officials from 
virginia and south carolina 
martinez said he is satisfied that this objective test by 
independent experts conclusively shows what we have been saying all 
along that floridas electric chair is in working order the 
source of problems during this states last execution was 
accurately identified and has been corrected 
it is my sincere hope that defense attorneys will cease using 
this false argument as a basis for unsubstantiated appeals 
martinez said 
but jay nickerson with the office of capital collateral 
representative a statefunded agency that represents poor death 
row inmates was unimpressed by the test 
it proves it works real good on a colander it works real good 
when you take a sponge and put it in a toaster but i certainly 
dont want it used on my client he said adding that his group 
was denied permission to bring in its own experts 
morse said almost 50 tests of the chair had been conducted over 
the weekend he said he is convinced that it was a synthetic sponge 
that caused sparks and flames to shoot from taferos head 
tests using a synthetic sponge under the head electrode produced 
similiar results with flames and sparks spewing out 
corrections secretary richard dugger immediately notified the 
governors office of the test results but said he didnt know when 
they would be forwarded to the appeals court 
the execution of anthony bertolotti which had been scheduled 
for 7 am today was stayed by the florida supreme court until 7 
am thursday but attorneys have predicted that it is unlikely any 
executions will take place until the faultychair issue is settled 
in court

national health insurance is needed to avert a 
financial collapse of the healthcare system say some physicians 
and hospital officials the bush administration is unconvinced 
abandonment of the uninsured is becoming a societal disgrace 
and a financial disaster for many hospitals said edward thomas 
president of detroit receiving hospital and chairman of the 
michigan hospital association 
michigan hospitals lost 350 million last year treating patients 
who could not or would not pay thomas told a senate subcommittee 
monday 
nearly 25 percent of the people treated at his innercity 
hospital are not covered by insurance he said 
there is mounting evidence that the system is on the verge of 
fiscal collapse said norton j greenberger chairman of the 
department of medicine at the university of kansas medical center 
as many as 37 million americans have no health insurance 
greenberger told the senate finance subcommittee on health for 
families and the uninsured nearly as many have inadequate or 
interrupted overage he said 
sen donald riegle dmich the subcommittee chairman said the 
situation underscores the need to develop a national strategy for 
providing health care for all americans it ought to be clear to us 
that the system is breaking down 
however health and human services secretary louis sullivan told 
business leaders in atlanta on monday that the solution will be 
found in a free market where businesses are not burdened with 
requirements 
those who call for a radical revamping of our healthcare 
system suggesting nationalized medicine are mistaken 
sullivan said in his prepared remarks which were made available in 
washington

two of the 17 workers killed by an explosion 
at a texas chemical plant had told relatives they were worried 
about the plants safety according to family members 
the workers also had worries about training at atlantic 
richfield cos plant in channelview where vapors caught fire and 
exploded near an electric compressor july 5 witnesses told a house 
panel on monday 
safety has to come before profit said sandy davis widow of 
greg davis an electrician killed in the blast ms davis wept 
while testifying that her husband told her several times he was 
unsure of the skills of some of his fellow contractors 
the chief of the occupational safety and health administration 
gerald scannell said the agency has proposed new safety rules for 
the chemical industry but the rules arent being put into place 
fast enough said two houston congressmen democrat mike andrews 
and republican jack fields 
theres not a chance in hell id work for a chemical plant 
unless i had a 1yearold child and was out of work aid rep 
christopher shays rconn referring to davis whose widow said he 
took the arco job in suburban houston after being unemployed for 
six months and becoming a new father 
but fields cautioned it is doubtful that the government or 
any particular company can ever completely guarantee that 
something isnt going to go wrong 
the congressmen said they were frustrated that 40 workers had 
been killed at chemical companies in the nine months since the 
house employment and housing subcommittee examined the october 
explosion that killed 23 at a phillips plastics plant in pasadena

public schools in 13 states are permitted to 
teach about religion and the bible may be taught as literature in 
10 states a new survey finds 
it also shows that 23 states allow excused absences for 
religious holidays and 22 mention observance of a moment of silence 
in their laws or regulations

issues involving religions and public education 
the survey which drew responses from all states except hawaii 
was to determine how many laws regulations or guidelines were on 
the books of states in matters of religion or moral education a 
law or regulation was counted whether it permitted or forbade a 
practice 
teaching about religion in public schools is different from 
teaching religion said charles c haynes of americans united

a psychiatrist testifying in behalf of the 
rock band judas priest said two men who allegedly shot themselves 
because of subliminal messages by the group had a number of risk 
factors that could lead to suicide 
donald lunde who teaches at stanford university testified 
monday the two men exhibited personality disorders and suffered 
from drug and alcohol abuse dysfunctional family lives and 
emotional problems 
a combination of these factors can tip the balance toward 
suicide lunde said 
each of these young men were supportive of the notion of 
suicide he said the more of these things you have the 
greater predisposition you have toward suicide 
lunde said his review of extensive medical histories and files 
on both fans of the heavy metal group convinced him the two 
exhibited a combination of risk factors that could potentially lead 
to suicide 
the families of raymond belknap 18 and james vance then 20 
filed suit against the band and cbs records claiming subliminal 
messages on judas priests 1978 stained class album drove the 
young men to a suicide pact 
belknap died from a single blast from a shotgun held to his chin 
on dec 23 1985 vance blew away the lower half of his face but 
survived the shooting he lived three more years and fathered a 
child before dying of complications from his injuries and a 
reaction to medications 
the defense denies subliminal messages exist on the album and 
counters that the young mens troubled lives including family 
violence drug and alcohol abuse poor academics and brushes with 
the law determined their fates not some subconscious command 
lunde who has testified as an expert witness in such 
highprofile cases as the jonestown massacre hillside strangler 
and patty hearst trials said the brain cannot decipher messages 
recorded backward and cannot perceive words masked by music or 
other sound 
you either hear it or you dont we dont have more than one 
mind up there it either hears it it perceives it and it registers 
it or it doesnt he said suicide is not a decision that can 
be made by the subconscious mind 
vivian lynch representing vances family disparaged lundes 
testimony 
i dont think its relevant she said hes not 
knowledgeable in the field of subliminal messages 
the plaintiffs have not finished presenting their case but 
lunde was allowed to testify for the defense monday because it was 
uncertain he would be available when the band and cbs records begin 
to present their cases

in some areas of cuba oxen are replacing 
gasguzzling tractors in havana office workers are being asked 
now and then to do without airconditioning fuel at most state 
enterprises has been cut back 10 percent 
and this could be only the beginning 
cubans are bracing for tough times the result in part of last 
years democratic upheaval in eastern europe and the prospect that 
cuba may no longer be able to count on soviet generosity to 
buttress its economy 
for years cuba has suffered from a us trade and financial 
embargo 
but now all over the island cubans are being warned at town 
meetings that additional belt tightening may be around the corner 
if bargainrate soviet oil supplies averaging about 90 million 
barrels annually are cut off and there is no money to tap 
alternate sources 
soviet deliveries already have slowed and president fidel 
castro alluded to the problem in a speech last month 
stubborn realities are there we constantly have to think in 
terms of less and less fuel we have to tell the truth 
an added concern is that soviet officials have spoken publicly 
about the possibility of a phased reduction of overall soviet 
economic assistance to cuba a windfall estimated by some at 4 
billion to 5 billion a year 
us sources have said there has been a marked decline in 
purchases of cuban sugar by the soviet union at prices 
substantially higher than world market levels a form of subsidy 
for the cuban economy 
president bush has been appealing to the soviets to cut castro 
off the united states has expressed reluctance to provide direct 
aid to the troubled soviet economy as long as moscow sends billions 
of rubles to cuba 
special period in peacetime is the somewhat benign sounding 
name for the draconian measures castro has in mind in the event 
cuba has to go it alone 
to show that he means business dress rehearsals are being held 
around the island to give cubans a taste of what may lie ahead 
oxen are being tried out on farms in western cuba 
military recruits are being asked to extend their tours of duty 
by two months to help the armed services become selfsufficient in 
food 
under the most extreme austerity measures thousands could be 
thrown out of work in havana partly because a suspension of most 
bus service would make it impossible for many to commute 
already some offices are experimenting with allowing employees 
to try working at home to see whether their labors would still be 
useful 
under the worst case scenario castro has said that all housing 
construction would be halted immediately and the manufacture of 
adult clothing would be suspended 
not all enterprises would be affected cubas ambitious tourism 
program slated to bring an almost fivefold increase in the number 
of foreign visitors to 15 million by 1995 would be spared 
castro is discovering somewhat belatedly what his noncommunist 
predecessors here knew all along as earners of foreign exchange 
cubas biggest assets are its tropical climate and its miles of 
sandy beaches 
some cuban officials believe that a shift in trading partners 
from the former socialist bloc to western industrialized nations 
will brighten cubas economic prospects over the long run 
castro has complained bitterly about the low quality products 
sent by eastern european countries to cuba in exchange for prized 
cuban exports such as sugar citrus fruit and nickel 
cuba may now be able to use these exports to buy high quality 
goods from the capitalist west the officials said but reshaping 
foreign trade relationships takes time and for now the future is 
extraordinarily bleak 
some cubans have lost hope 
more than two dozen presumed asylum seekers are holed up at 
three european embassies these days they decided to abandon the 
revolution even though castro has said none of them will be given 
permission to leave the country 
according to the us coast guard the number of cubans who fled 
to florida during the first six months of this year totals 196 
compared with 57 for the same period last year 
but castro seems determined to maintain his orthodox brand of 
marxism even at the cost of the most farreaching austerity 
measures he has criticized gorbachevs reforms and condemned the 
changes in eastern europe 
if in five years we dont build housing if thats the price 
for saving the revolution then we will spend five years without 
building them he says

five months after it was suspended because of an 
explosion europes ariane program is back in business with todays 
launch of a rocket carrying a double payload of french and german 
television satellites 
the 37th ariane rocket was to blast off tonight from the ariane 
facility in french guiana south america with a 49minute launch 
window beginning at 625 pm est 
it is the first attempt at an ariane launch since a similar 
rocket carrying two japanese communications satellites blew up less 
than two minutes after takeoff on feb 22 both satellites were 
destroyed 
investigators said the explosion was caused by a tiny piece of 
cloth that clogged a line carrying water coolant to one of the 
engines 
the respected french weekly lexpress reported in a cover story 
that the explosion and at least two previous ariane failures may 
have been caused by sabotage 
officials of arianespace the commercial branch of the european 
space agency have said there was no evidence to indicate sabotage 
but that technical and security checks would be intensified 
the ariane project has been dogged by embarrassing and costly 
setbacks including rockets that have exploded or crashed and 
expensive delays 
but ariane rockets dominate the private aerospace industry 
carrying about half of the worlds commercial payloads into space 
excluding todays flight arianespace has contracts worth 28 
billion to launch 37 more satellites 
ariane rockets have sent into space 45 commercial satellites 
from canada france west germany great britain india italy 
spain and the united states as well as international organizations 
such as intelsat and eutelsat 
ariane is facing increased competition however from american 
privatesector rockets including the titan4 made by martin 
marietta corp general dynamics atlascentaur and the delta built 
by mcdonnell douglas 
until now us rockets have mainly launched military and 
scientific satellites under the supervision of the us air force 
and the national aeronautics and space administration 
china also is a contender in commercial launches with its long 
march rocket as well as the soviet union with its proton and japan 
with the h2 rocket now under development 
flight 37 was to put two satellites into geostationary orbit 
tdf 2 a fivechannel french television satellite and the 
11channel dfs kopernikus 2 for west germanys deutsche bundespost 
telekom 
the french satellite weighs 4621 pounds and will join a twin 
already in orbit to form a powerful relay system that can serve 400 
million television viewers according to arianespace the 
kopernikus weighs 3126 pounds 
the two satellites are being lifted into space by an ariane 4 
rocket the most recent version introduced in 1988 two years 
behind schedule it features four strapon boosters powered by 
liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen and stands 190 feet high on the 
launch pad 
different configurations of the strapon boosters using liquid 
or solid fuel can be used according to the needs of individual 
clients 
a newer version of the rocket the heavylift launcher ariane 5 
is being developed for planned introduction in 1995 
arianespace is a consortium made up of aerospace electronics 
and banking companies from 11 western european countries belgium 
britain denmark france ireland italy netherlands spain 
switzerland sweden and west germany

mountain park they came from across the united states and canada 
from as far away as australia either for the sheer thrill of 
victory or for a piece of the 95000 in prizes 
most people think that horseshoes is something that farmers do 
out behind the barn or maybe in the backyard competitor noel 
guy said 
very few people know how very well organized the sport is 
because we dont get much exposure said guy a retired 
electronics technician from san jose calif we dont make it on 
tv like bowling or golf 
bushs attachment to the sport did a big shot in the arm for 
horseshoe pitching but hes not the first man to practice the game 
at the white house guy said 
harry truman pitched horseshoes he said i didnt know 
that either until just about a year ago horseshoes was not that 
far developed at that time now president bush is getting all the 
attention 
horseshoe pitching originated with soldiers in ancient greece 
who used discarded horseshoes for sport imitating discus throwing 
at the olympian games more than 30 million people now pitch 
horseshoes in tournaments or in city parks and backyards the 
organization says 
a ringer when the points of a horseshoe encircle a steel stake 
in a clay or sand pit counts as 3 points one point is awarded 
when a horseshoe lands within 6 inches of the stake 
two people compete in a game by throwing two horseshoes to the 
opposite end of the court they tally points before repeating 
throws to the opposite pit the first to get 40 points is the 
winner

rule despite claims that black nationalists are preparing to seize 
power if negotiations fail 
de klerk says he will meet aug 6 with nelson mandela and other 
top anc leaders to try and clear the way for negotiations on 
sharing political power with the black majority 
but he has warned all political groups against trying to seize 
power 
he said after a meeting with senior government officials late 
monday that there was no room for any political organization to 
stockpile arms in order to force its will at the negotiation table 
or in any other way to prevent the political process taking its 
normal course

south africa but denies police and media reports of an anc plot to 
seize power if political negotiations fail 
police have arrested dozens of anc militants in connection with 
the reported plot 
de klerk said he viewed the arrests in an extremely serious 
light 
he rejected calls from the proapartheid main opposition 
conservative party and other rightwing groups to call off talks 
with the anc but he said the government was determined to maintain 
law and order 
it is imperative that good government be maintained at all 
times therefore disorder anarchy and terrorism will not be 
tolerated he said 
the government and the anc are trying to clear the way for 
constitutional negotiations on sharing power with the black 
majority the anc is demanding release of imprisoned militants and 
other preliminary conditions 
in other developments the independent south african press 
association said today that the death toll from black faction 
fighting sunday in sebokeng outside johannesburg had risen to 24

an electronic grid laid down by a navy tug will 
guide a hightech probe in the pacific ocean search for a cargo 
door that blew off a united airlines jetliner killing nine people 
the national transportation safety board completed its 
investigation without the cargo door but asked the navy to find it 
because the door could provide evidence to help improve aircraft 
safety 
the 226foot tug narragansett today was to lay down the last of 
eight transponders which transmit electrical signals to chart 
movements of the video cameraequipped submersible the centerpiece 
of the navys orion search system 
the transponders will hang about 150 feet above the ocean floor 
around the perimeter of the 24squaremile search area some 100 
miles southwest of honolulu said lt cmdr bob anderson spokesman 
for the pacific fleet 
the door is believed to be lying in about 15000 feet of water 
the submersible called a towfish is expected to be lowered 
into the ocean on wednesday anderson said 
if the door is spotted another device will be used to recover 
it later 
once the tug reached the search area monday they anticipated a 
day and onehalf setting up and getting ready we expect theyll be 
ready to put it in the water by wednesday said lt cmdr sandy 
stairs another pacific fleet spokesman 
flight 811 carried 355 passengers when it left honolulu 
international airport for new zealand on feb 24 1989 
shortly after takeoff a cargo door opened at 22000 feet 
tearing away a section of fuselage and causing the boeing 747 to 
decompress nine people were swept to their deaths and five others 
were seriously injured the crew managed to return the jet to 
honolulu 
the safety board decided faulty design of the doors locking 
mechanism probably caused a cockpit panel light to falsely indicate 
the door was locked 
the federal agency blamed united the boeing co and the federal 
aviation administration for failure to correct problems with the 
locking mechanism

couples who have violent relationships 
common interests or several children tend to have sex more often 
than other couples a sociologist says 
next to youth shared interests were the greatest indicator of 
sexual frequency in a marriage said the university of florida 
researcher who based the study on a nationwide survey of 5292 
married couples 
whether its something as simple as taking walks together or 
enjoying the same hobbies sharing activities outside the bedroom 
is a big predictor of how often married couples have sex 
sociologist denise donnelly said monday 
ms donnelly said she found that partners in violent marriages 
had sexual relations more often than other couples 
people in these marriages may have intercourse more because of 
a honeymoon period that follows each outbreak of violence she 
said these couples may not only fight with a passion but make 
up with a passion as well 
another explanation might be that people who are physically 
expressive in showing their anger might be physically expressive in 
other areas of their lives including their sexual relationships 
she said 
ms donnelly also found that people who lived together before 
marriage had more active sex lives than couples who didnt 
since these people are more individualistic and less prone to 
follow societys expectations they may also be less likely to have 
normal levels of coital frequency she said 
income education race and place of residence had no bearing on 
how often a couple had sex she said 
but contrary to other studies she found that couples with more 
children led the most active love lives 
other researchers have thought that the more children present 
the fewer the uninterrupted opportunities for intercourse ms 
donnelly said in reality the more one has intercourse the 
greater the odds of conceiving a child and the more children one 
ultimately has 
not surprisingly she said couples with schoolaged children 
said they had sex more often than did those with younger children 
that is because preschoolers need more care and tend to 
intrude more she said your 13yearold probably wouldnt pop 
his head in the bedroom door and say what are you guys doing 
but your 5yearold very well might

a police tape made after a fatal shooting at 
the mansion of actor marlon brandocannot be used in court against 
his son christian who faces a murder charge in the death of his 
pregnant sisters lover 
municipal court judge larry fidler ruled monday that detectives 
failed to properly advise the younger brando of his rights 
following the may 16 shooting of dag drollet 26 
prosecutors wanted to play a lengthy recording of brandos 
statements to detectives but his lawyers objected 
detective steve osti said he informed brando of his right to 
remain silent but neglected to say that if he could not afford a 
lawyer one would be appointed 
fidler ruled the omission was serious enough to invalidate the 
tape as evidence 
the dispute came at a pretrial hearing that will determine 
whether there is sufficient evidence for brando to stand trial for 
murder and a weapons violation charge 
the elder brando star of such films at on the waterfront 
and the the godfather sat solemnly in the courtrooms front 
row occasionally taking notes 
his 32yearold son appeared nervous as he was led into the 
jammed courtroom outside reporters camera crews and movie fans 
crowded hallways 
officer steve cunningham the first witness to testify said 
brando told him he killed the boyfriend of his pregnant sister 
cheyenne during a scuffle 
brando said the fight broke out when the deceased went nuts 
cunningham testified 
i didnt mean to shoot him christian brando was quoted as 
telling cunningham the first police officer on the scene 
ms brando was then seven months pregnant with drollets child 
she recently gave birth to a boy in tahiti where the brandos 
maintain a home 
she is said to be suffering from nervous exhaustion and a doctor 
told authorities she could not return to california to testify 
the officers testimony appeared to support the defense 
contention that the 45caliber handgun went off accidentally 
during a scuffle between the 6foot brando and the 6foot3 drollet 
but prosecutors have said they found no evidence of a struggle 
and that drollet was shot while sitting on a sofa holding a 
cigarette lighter in one hand and a television remote control in 
the other

a leukemia victims search for a perfect bone 
marrow donor helped triple the number of potential donors in a 
national registry but none of the 50000 people who volunteered 
for blood tests were compatible 
instead 20yearold allison atlas will get an imperfectly 
matched transplant from her mother before time runs out 
thanks to the atlas familys search 10 other patients have 
found compatible donors since november said simon atlas a cousin 
of allisons father 
he said monday that miss atlas from bethesda md will be 
admitted to the hutchinson cancer research center in seattle 
probably at the end of this week to begin weeklong preparations 
for the transplant 
her mother arline has been a fallback all along shes not a 
perfect match obviously or we would have used her at the 
outset simon atlas said 
miss atlas is one of about 10000 americans a year who search 
for a potentially lifesaving marrow match from an unrelated donor 
largely because of patients like miss atlas public awareness 
about transplants has grown over the past eight months 
dozens of grassroots groups around the nation have emulated the 
campaign of her supporters friends of allison they implore 
neighbors coworkers schoolmates and worshipers to take blood 
tests and give money if the particular patient doesnt find a 
match they reason maybe someone else will 
friends of allison has given blood tests to 49400 volunteers in 
the united states and 600 in israel since november the group has 
also taken in 3 million in donations to pay for laboratory work 
the test results were listed with the national marrow donor 
program and a related international registry 
when the atlases began their search the national registry had 
gathered 57000 donors in three years now because of the atlases 
and other families efforts it has more than 150000 names 
the odds for finding a marrow match are at least 20000to1

city officials who allowed about 3000 pap tests 
to languish for a year betrayed the public trust health 
commissioner woodrow myers said before firing a top aide in the 
scandal 
after the delay 11 tests revealed cancerous cells 93 showed 
precancer conditions and 600 contained other abnormalities 
no women have died as a result of the mishandling but some 
could be at risk myers said 
mismanagement and poor supervision caused critical delays 
myers told reporters monday 
the scandal involved pap tests administered to about 3000 women 
at cityrun clinics the tests were allowed to accumulate for a 
year without laboratory analysis 
pap smears test women for cervical and uterine cancer 
myers announced a departmental shakeup that included the firing 
of dr kenneth dressler former assistant commissioner in the 
departments bureau of laboratories 
the health commissioner also announced norman scherzer former 
assistant commissioner for epidemiology and prevention services 
and john miles former director of the sexually transmitted disease 
department were being reassigned within the department 
dr stephen schultz former deputy commissioner for epidemiology 
and prevention services already has been reassigned from 
administrative to clinical duties 
myers said investigators found that department policies since 
1988 have resulted in an outrageous insensitivity to women who 
rely on this department 
he said all but two of 104 women whose test results were most 
ominous have been located myers conceded there was a very low 
prospect for finding the other two one of whom he said had used a 
false name the other was wanted by the fbi myers said 
he said all of the tests that went unread have since been 
analyzed and department laboratories will return results within a 
week

the united states will begin removing 
its chemical weapons from west germany this week and will ship them 
a us atoll in the pacific where they will be destroyed in an 
incinerator officials said 
the west german defense ministry said monday in a statement that 
the operation to remove the 100000 artillery rounds will begin 
thursday 
a us army spokesman in west germany said he was awaiting 
confirmation from washington and could not confirm that date 
chancellor helmut kohl and former president reagan agreed in 
1986 to remove the weapons by 1992 president bush advanced the 
timetable to 1990 said james boyle a spokesman for headquarters 
us army europe 
boyle said the artillery shells in 6inchdiameter and 8inch 
sizes are loaded with liquid nerve agents 
he said they have been stored since 1968 at a us military site 
in clausen a small town near the us military complex at 
kaiserslautern in southwestern west germany 
this is the most wellplanned operation weve had here as far 
as the transport of munitions there is safety measure upon safety 
measure redundant throughout the operation boyle said 
each convoy will include 20 flatbed trucks loaded with the 
chemical weapons stored in two airtight steel containers and 60 
other escort trucks including german and us security forces 
emergency crews and decontamination teams he said 
boyle said there would be about 30 convoys running one a day 
the trucks will travel a variety of routes for safety and 
security reasons from clausen to a us depot at miesau about 30 
miles away he said 
the containers will be loaded onto special trains at miesau for 
the trip north to nordenham on the north sea where they will be 
reloaded onto us navy ships for transport to johnston atoll in 
the pacific 
boyle said the chemical weapons will be destroyed later in a 
specially built incinerator on the us atoll about 800 miles 
southwest of hawaii 
joe badilla an army spokesman in washington said the 
administration first had to certify to congress on tuesday at the 
latest that the incinerator was working once that was done 
shipment from west germany could begin he said 
officials said the removal operation was expected to be 
completed before october

a moscow man went on trial today in a packed and 
raucous courtroom on charges of inciting intolerance of jews in a 
case that highlights fears of growing antisemitism among russians 
but judge ai muratov postponed the trial of konstantin 
smirnovostashvili after only a few minutes of procedural work and 
two breaks because of the crush of reporters hemming the docket and 
noisy viewers who shouted shame at him 
smirnovostashvili 64 was arrested for allegedly organizing 
protesters who broke up a meeting jan 18 at the central house of 
literature in moscow and insulted jewish writers 
if convicted he could be sentenced to up to five years in 
prison 
the case has received wide publicity in the soviet press at a 
time when soviet jews are emigrating by the thousands many because 
they fear a wave of antisemitic attacks by extreme russian 
nationalists groups like pamyat 
speaking to reporters from the docket during a break in the 
case smirnovostashvili denied being antisemitic but charged that 
the soviet unions 14 milion jews hold a disproportionate number 
of high places in government and society 
a russian person is brought to trial in the center of russia 
for insulting injuring the dignity and for instigating 
intolerance against those who enjoy massive privileges and who 
hold the leading posts in our society he said 
even if i am accused and punished in no instance will i agree 
with the punishment because no one can show me that i somehow 
somewhere broke the law said the defendant a short emphatic 
man with a fringe of gray hair around his bald head 
smirnovostashvili said his was the first such case brought to 
trial under a law passed as the soviet union grapples with 
widespread ethnic unrest 
he said he was not certain whether the judge and two civilian 
assistants would consider the case as a purely legal matter or 
consider its political implications convicting him would further 
polarize soviet society he said 
a 36yearold jewish psychiatrist in the crowd who identified 
himself only as eduard said the case would test whether soviet 
courts traditionally considered arms of the ruling communists had 
become fairer 
among those in the front row of the crowd were two wellknown 
progressives writer ales adamovich and historian yuri afanasiev 
more than 71000 jews emigrated from the soviet union after 
travel laws were eased last year and thousands more have left so 
far this year jewish leaders have cited an unprecedented panic 
among the jewish population 
judge muratov adjourned the case for a day after rejecting 
smirnovostashvilis bid to dismiss his courtappointed attorney 
and before the defendant could enter a plea 
members of the crowd packed into wooden benches in the stuffy 
courtroom of the moscow city court building shouted shame at 
the judge when he denied smirnovostashvilis bid 
smirnovostashvili had told the court he wanted to dismiss 
defense lawyer svetlana birulina because he did not trust the 
moscow lawyers association to which she belongs he also told the 
court that the majority of soviet lawyers are jewish 
in a report on the january confrontation at the central house of 
literature the popular weekly ogonyok quoted one of the protesters 
as saying through a megaphone 
your time is over neither the police nor the kgb nor the 
party will help you now we will be the masters of the country and 
you newcomers clear out and go to israel how long can we 
tolerate your russophobia 
in an editorial on sunday the communist party daily pravda 
called for the country to recognize that antisemitism exists and 
to find a solution

associated press writerequals 
washington ap senators are reacting cautiously to david h 
souters nomination to the supreme court most conceding they know 
little about him even though they confirmed him as a federal 
appeals judge three months ago 
i want to get to know him get to know his record so i can 
make a considered decision and im sure hell be fine sen 
orrin hatch rutah said monday after president bush chose souter 
to succeed retired justice william brennan 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said senators must determine 
whether he possesses a strong commitment to the fundamental values 
of the constitution and the bill of rights while sen paul simon 
dill said he wanted to know more about souters record as new 
hampshire attorney general 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio called souter pretty much of a 
blank slate 
all four are members of the senate judiciary committee which 
will hold confirmation hearings on souter there questions are 
bound to be raised about his views on abortion and other matters 
most senators said however they would not break tradition and 
ask souter pointblank how he would decide the abortion issue if 
confirmed but they said the topic was guaranteed to come up 
people are very much focused on the abortion issue and 
frankly i think thats a mistake sen arlen specter rpa 
said today on the cbs this morning television show i do not 
think there ought to be a single litmus test for a nominee for the 
supreme court 
that judgment was seconded by sen patrick leahy dvt who 
said on cbs the president avoided making this a litmus test 
candidate i would hope the senate would avoid making it a litmus 
test candidate 
however leahy acknowledged earlier that it would be naive to 
think that roe vs wade in one form or another is not going to be 
part of a lot of the questions he was referring to the 1973 
supreme court ruling that legalized abortion 
meanwhile conservative groups reacted favorably to souters 
appointment while prochoice and civil rights organizations urged 
caution 
souter aroused no controversy when the senate approved him as a 
judge of the 1st us court of appeals in april as a result his 
confirmation proceedings apparently blurred into those of numerous 
other judicial candidates at least for some senators 
judicial candidates are screened by the fbi the american bar 
association the judiciary committee staff and various court 
watchdog groups but their hearings are often love fests with a 
friendly senator presiding and confirmation frequently comes 
without a formal vote with only a skeleton crew of senators on the 
floor 
one lawmaker who has known souter for years sen warren rudman 
rnh described him as the classic conservative intellectual 
but added that the nominee cannot be described as an ideologue in 
any way shape or form 
sen slade gorton rwash said he had known souter since they 
both were attorneys general of their states he was an excellent 
attorney general so my initial reaction is positive gorton said 
the top republican on the judiciary committee sen strom 
thurmond of south carolina said souters brief time on the federal 
bench and lack of a controversial record should keep him safe from 
initial opposition 
simon said the same but added that he was concerned about a pair 
of cases handled by souter when he was new hampshire attorney 
general one involved the issue of separation of church and state 
while the other concerned voting rights simon said 
it would be a terrible injustice to confirm a nominee without 
knowing that he is committed to protecting americans fundamental 
constitutional rights including privacy and the right to choose 
said kate michelman head of the national abortion rights action 
league 
we are pleased that president bush says he is nominating a 
justice who will interpret the constitution according to its text 
and who will not legislate from the bench said a statement from 
the national right to life committee 
but eleanor smeal president of the feminist majority said 
the senate judiciary committee members must demand to know his 
position on abortion rights our lives are on the line and for once 
in political decisionmaking womens lives must come first 
republican national committee spokesman charlie black called 
souter an excellent choice 
judge souter is an intelligent person who will be a fair 
arbiter of the law black said 
hes a pig in a poke a sununu special said harvard law 
professor alan dershowitz how can we be expected to confirm a 
nominee that no one knows anything about white house chief of 
staff john sununu as governor of new hampshire appointed souter 
to that states supreme court 
richard a viguerie chairman of the united conservatives of 
america said in a statement that the souter nomination represented 
a first step for bush in repairing the split between himself 
and the conservatives his most important constituency

a detective testified that he lied about 
nonexistent fingerprints to get a teenager to confess to taking 
part in the central park jogger attack 
defendant yusef salaam 16 repeatedly told detective thomas 
mckenna he was not in the park the night of the attack the law 
officer said on the witness stand monday 
convinced the boy had been there during the socalled 
wilding attack mckenna said we have fingerprints from the 
joggers pants theyre satin and very smooth well compare those 
prints with yours and if they match you dont have to say 
anything youre going for rape 
mckenna said salaam then told him i was there but i didnt 
rape her 
the detective admitted under crossexamination that he knew of 
no such fingerprints and that his reference to them was a lie 
police found no fingerprints at the crime scene where the 
investment banker was beaten unconscious gangraped and left for 
dead 
courts have upheld the use of deceit by police to extract 
confessions as long as the accused were not threatened coerced or 
improperly advised of their rights 
after salaams alleged confession mckenna said he then asked 
how could you possibly do something like this 
it was just something to do it was fun mckenna quoted 
salaam as saying referring to handwritten notes 
the april 19 1989 attack was allegedly carried out by a gang 
of youths roving the park looking for random victims a practice 
known by the slang term wilding 
salaam admitted hitting the woman with a pipe and fondling her 
and gave the names of other youths who allegedly assaulted her 
mckenna testified unlike other defendants salaam gave police no 
videotaped or signed written statement 
salaams lawyer robert burns denied his client made the 
statements that mckenna recounted he tried unsuccessfully to get 
the testimony barred from the trial 
salaam antron mccray and raymond santana all 16 are being 
tried on charges of rape attempted murder sexual abuse assault 
robbery and riot in connection with the attack on the woman and 
less serious attacks on two male joggers 
the woman now 30 is back at work at salomon brothers inc 
investment banking firm but suffers from impaired vision and 
balance and has lost her sense of smell as a result of the assault 
three other youths charged in the attack are to stand trial 
later this year

severe flooding caused by heavy rainfall in the 
lake baikal region of siberia has killed a number of people and 
left thousands homeless the newspaper sovietskaya rossia said 
today 
more than 400 bridges were swept away as rivers flowing into 
lake baikal overflowed their banks during the rainfall in early 
july the newspaper said power and water supplies in the region 
have been disrupted 
the newspaper said a number of people died in the flooding but 
did not give a death toll 
in the city of chita 2500 miles east of moscow residents 
ignored warnings by officials to take precautions against the 
predicted rainstorms 
several days before the flood we had arranged for a special 
car with a loudspeaker to mve along the streets of the city warning 
people about the danger said chita mayor yuri timofeev but 
people only laughed at us 
according to sovietskaya rossia the flooding caused 635 
million in damages including 270 million in farm damage more 
than 600 cattle and 10000 sheep drowned in the flooding the 
report said 
the newspaper said a regional task force has been set up to deal 
with the emergency 
sovietskaya rossia said meteorologists were predicting more rain 
in august 
the newspaper blamed much of the damage on the intentional 
destruction of forests in the region the situation is aggravated 
by the fact that thoughtless largescale woodfelling renders the 
region particularly vulnerable to any summer rains it said

government troops have captured a key 
northern village in fierce fighting that left 30 tamil rebels dead 
military officials said today 
the village controls access to the jaffna peninsula where the 
rebels are based 
four soldiers were killed in the monday attack in which 
helicopters dropped troops and commandos behind rebel defenses to 
take the village of paranthan officials said they spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
paranthan is seven miles south of elephant pass a causeway that 
links the jaffna peninsula with the mainland 
the capture of paranthan could provide a launching pad for 
attacks on jaffna which the tamil tiger rebels have held since 
they repudiated a ceasefire with government forces on june 11 
the rebels control all of jaffna except for four government 
bases that have been under siege for more than a month almost one 
million civilians mostly ethnic tamils live on the peninsula 
tamil militants took up arms in 1983 claiming their community 
was being discriminated against in jobs education and language by 
the sinhalese majority 
tamils who are mostly hindus make up 18 percent of sri lankas 
16 million people sinhalese who are mostly buddhists comprise 75 
percent of the population and control the army and the government 
at least 13800 people have died in the tamil insurrection 
last week the rebels blew up the elephant pass causeway the 
only viable route for a largescale crossing into the peninsula 
military officials said the causeway has since been repaired 
at least 2890 combatants have been killed in fighting since the 
rebels violated the june ceasefire 
the latest casualties included eight soldiers killed monday near 
the east coast port of trincomalee in a rebel ambush military 
officials said 
another soldier was killed near batticaloa south of 
trincomalee they said 
when the fighting began last month the rebels held the 
tamildominated areas on the north and east of the island the army 
has dislodged the rebels from most towns in the east and the 
guerrillas have retreated into the jungles to fight what could be a 
protracted war 
in the north the army has been unable to make significant 
headway because of the difficult access to jaffna

the quebec government has offered to resume 
talks with mohawks over a land dispute but indian representatives 
rejected the offer and some said they would close more roads across 
canada today in protest 
the canadian provinces native affairs minister john ciaccia 
said monday the government was ready to resume the talks and would 
agree to have human rights representatives as observers 
but he said the talks should be held away from the barricades 
where the mohawks and police have faced each other for nearly two 
weeks in an armed standoff involving the land claim dispute 
last week the mohawks asked observers from the united nations 
or amnesty international to monitor the talks 
the red cross one of the few groups that has been allowed 
beyond the barricades by quebec provincial police would be 
permitted to continue providing food and supplies ciaccia said 
meeting another mohawk demand for free movement of food and 
medicine 
but ellen gabriel speaking for the mohawks at a news conference 
monday night rejected the main condition that the negotiations 
take place outside the oka barricades and exclude representatives 
from the akwesasne reserve which straddles the ontario quebec and 
new york state borders 
she said the mohawks fear the provincial police 
how can we feel safe outside these barricades when they wont 
even let food and water through she said 
the conflict began july 11 when quebec provincial police stormed 
a 4monthold roadblock set up by kanesatake mohawks to stop the 
expansion of an oka golf course on land they claim an officer was 
killed in a gunbattle but it was unclear whether it was from 
mohawk or police fire 
ciaccia who had held negotiations near the barricades until 
talks broke down about a week ago did not say where hed like new 
talks to be held 
in an interview ciaccia said the proposal to have talks outside 
the barricades is not for security reasons but to create an 
atmosphere of calm 
while the barricades remain at oka 30 miles west of montreal a 
blockade by the kahnawake mohawks of the mercier bridge continues 
forcing thousands of people to find other ways to get into the city 
from the south shore of montreal island 
a new commuter train service went into effect monday but only 
550 people took advantage of the service 
indians in british columbia and saskatchewan vowed to close more 
roads today in support of quebecs mohawks 
chiefs definitely are prepared to shut the country down 
said lawrence courtoreille alberta spokesman for the assembly of 
first nations 
natives have been talking about that possibility for years 
he said noting that major highways main railway lines and hydro 
lines run through reserves making them vulnerable to attack 
there were 12 road blockades in place in british columbia and 
saul terry president of the union of british columbia indian 
chiefs said more could go up

the strike was called to mourn the destruction of baghdad the 
capital of the abbasid islamic empire by mongol warriors in 1258

the first senior british official to visit china 
since beijing crushed its prodemocracy movement arrived today 
extending a pattern by other western nations of gradually restoring 
political ties 
francis maude the foreign office minister responsible for hong 
kong is the highestranking european official to visit china since 
the european community banned highlevel government exchanges to 
protest beijings june 1989 crackdown on the student protests 
as permanent members of the un security council we have 
many shared interests and common responsibilities in the world 
its essential that we work together on these maude told 
reporters at the airport 
his visit coincided with that of former australian prime 
minister gough whitlam who met monday with chinese premier li peng 
the official xinhua news agency said li told whitlam the 
clouds of attempting to isolate china are dispersing as more and 
more countries are responding to chinas sincere desire for 
friendly coexistence with other countries 
most western nations banned highlevel governmental exchanges 
after the military crushed the prodemocracy movement leaving 
hundreds dead but the european community granted exceptions to 
britain because of its links with hong kong and to portugal 
because of macao 
the british colony of hong kong reverts to chinese rule in 1997 
and the portuguese colony of macao is to be returned two years 
later 
observers said maudes threeday visit could pave the way for 
other western countries to resume diplomatic contacts 
in recent weeks highlevel officials from japan and canada have 
also visited china 
maudes main mission is to advance discussions on hong kong that 
stalled after the chinese crackdown 
the chinese and british governments have a common 
responsibility for promoting stability and prosperity of hong 
kong maude said 
during my visit here i shall be emphasizing to my hosts the 
british governments wish to work constructively and positively 
with the chinese to ensure the future of hong kong based on the 
joint declaration and the basic law he said 
maude was referring to the 1984 chinesebritish agreement to 
return hong kong to chinese rule in 1997 and to the 
miniconstitution that will govern the island after the turnover

contracts settled so far this year through 
collective bargaining gave workers average annual wage increases of 
38 percent over the life of the pacts the government said today 
the last time parties covered by those settlements negotiated 
usually in 1987 or 1988 average wage gains averaged 25 percent 
over the contract term the labor department said 
part of the gains reflected wage increases that were larger than 
those in previous contracts such as those for workers in 
transportation equipment manufacturing petroleum refining food 
stores and health services 
in addition there were wage increases for some workers such as 
those in the steel industry where there previously had been wage 
cuts or freezes the labor department said 
for the 12month period ending in june settlements that were 
reached provided wage adjustments averaging 36 percent a year over 
the contract life compared with 24 percent when the same parties 
bargained previously 
the average annual wage gain over the contract life has been 
increasing since the low of 17 percent for a 12month period 
which occurred for the year ending in september 1986 
the collective bargaining report like the labor departments 
broader employment cost index also released today showed workers 
in the fastgrowing service sector winning larger wage gains than 
manufacturing workers 
service workers received an average annual gain of 38 percent 
over the contract life while manufacturing workers received an 
average boost of 33 percent 
the average construction worker received gains of 42 percent a 
year over the life of the contract the report said 
the labor department said the 216 collective bargaining 
agreements it analyzed in the first six months of 1990 covered 
about 810000 workers the government tracks agreements covering 
bargaining units with at least 1000 workers 
the government said 88 such agreements covering about 983000 
workers are scheduled to expire or reopen for wage negotiations 
during the julyseptember period with many of those jobs in the 
automobile parcel delivery and construction industries 
in addition there are about 726000 workers under 130 contracts 
that had expired or been reopened but not negotiated or ratified 
prior to the end of june nearly half those workers are railroad 
employees the government said

two bank of england researchers today searched 
dustcovered leatherbound account books for records of a barrel 
of gold ukrainian officials said was stored there 270 years ago a 
spokesman said 
the archive search was prompted by british newspaper reports 
that the soviet republic of ukraine was claiming compensation for a 
barrel of gold left with the bank by the 18th century ukrainian 
military leader col pavel polubotok 
ukrainian officials reportedly have said the gold plus accrued 
interest would be worth 29 trillion that figure is roughly five 
times the us gross national product 
a spokesman for the bank of england said a check of the banks 
live accounts and safety deposit accounts made monday did not turn 
up a record of the barrel of gold he added that gold deposits do 
not accrue interest 
polubotok was reportedly put in jail by czar peter the great 
where he died in 1723 
two researchers are now looking back through 300 years of 
defunct accounts preserved on microfilm and in leatherbound 
ledgers for a record of any account with polubotok the spokesman 
said 
if there were a barrel in the vaults wed know about it 
said the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
we have quite a lot of gold as well as valuables and documents 
in the vaults which extend over three underground floors he said 
the bank of england was a private bank until 1946 when it was 
acquired by the government it is now the governments central 
bank but it continues to provide services for foreign governments 
and some private customers

president bushs nominee for the supreme 
court david h souter returned to the white house today for 
briefings on the confirmation process in the senate where he is 
certain to be grilled about his views on abortion and other 
divisive social issues 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said that the 
president would formally submit souters nomination on wednesday 
and that the nominee would then begin making the rounds of members 
of the senate judiciary committee 
souter was meeting today with frederick d mcclure bushs 
congressional liaison to help prepare him with the meetings with 
senators 
it is just the normal practice associated with new nominees 
mcclure said in an interview were going to have a chit chat 
about what lies ahead over the next few weeks 
mcclure said souter will meet first with members of the senate 
leadership then with committee members and with any other 
senators who want to meet him 
hes a wellqualified guy we hope the senate will agree 
mcclure said 
souter spent monday night at the home of sen warren rudman 
rnh who actively promoted the 50yearold federal appeals court 
judge from his home state 
calling souter a remarkable judge of keen intellect and the 
highest ability bush said monday that he and his advisers had 
deemed it inappropriate to ask souter his views on specific 
issues 
that will be the task of the senate judiciary committee 
expected to hold hearings in september 
one liberal committee member sen patrick leahy dvt 
pledged there will be a lot more known about him i guarantee 
you that 
i dont think itll be a hard sell at all when you look at 
the mans record experience and integrity and ability to deal with 
tough questions of law attorney general dick thornburgh said 
today on abcs good morning america 
souter 50 spent a dozen years as a state judge before joining 
the bostonbased 1st us circuit court of appeals on april 30 
if confirmed he would become the courts 105th justice its 
sixth bachelor never married he lives alone on the family farm 
near weare nh where he moved from the boston suburb of melrose 
mass when he was 11 
souter has a reputation back home for brilliance and diligence 
outside new hampshire hes barely known 
the president moved quickly in announcing his intention to 
nominate souter to replace justice william j brennan 84 who 
retired friday because of ill health 
bush on monday praised brennan the courts longtime leading 
liberal as one of the greatest figures of our age brennans 
departure gave bush his first chance to name someone to the 
nations highest court 
if he is confirmed souters vote may prove decisive for the 
future of legalized abortion as four of the remaining eight 
justices appear ready to overturn the 1973 roe vs wade decision 
that made abortion a constitutional right souter has not yet had 
to rule directly on abortion 
abortion rights groups already have demanded that the senate 
hearings focus on souters abortion views 
the increasingly conservative court also has been closely split 
on such issues as civil rights and criminal justice 
the reaction from key senators was restrained sen edward 
kennedy dmass a judiciary committee member and early opponent 
of president reagans failed nomination of robert bork to the 
court said he would wait to hear from souter before making up his 
mind 
kennedy said the senate must determine whether he possesses a 
strong commitment to the fundamental values of the constitution and 
the bill of rights that are obviously at stake in this important 
nomination 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said souters 
experience as a judge and as new hampshires attorney general are 
pluses but did not commit himself 
sen strom thurmond of south carolina the judiciary committees 
ranking republican said he expected few if any fireworks noting 
that souter was confirmed unanimously for his 1st circuit court job 
but another committee member sen howard metzenbaum dohio 
said there is a difference between being confirmed for the 
appeals court and for the supreme court 
as a member of the new hampshire supreme court for seven years 
souter established himself as a closetothevest judicial 
conservative 
in one of the rare civil rights cases in which he participated 
souter joined the state courts ruling in 1987 that said 
homosexuals may be barred from becoming adoptive or foster parents 
but the state court ruling also said that homosexuals may not be 
barred from running day care centers 
in a 1986 case souter joined the majority in ruling that 
doctors have a responsibility to test for birth defects and inform 
pregnant women of the option of abortion 
in a concurring opinion souter questioned the impact the 
decision would have on doctors who oppose abortion on moral 
grounds he said such physicians should not have to choose 
between rendering services that they morally condemn and leaving 
their profession in order to escape malpractice exposures 
souter was the lone dissenter in a 1985 state supreme court 
decision that struck down the use of police sobriety checkpoints 
the nations highest court upheld such police tactics earlier this 
year 
alan dershowitz a liberal attorney and professor at harvard law 
school called the nomination a sununu special 
john sununu bushs conservative white house chief of staff was 
the new hampshire governor who promoted souter to the state supreme 
court but sen warren rudman a moderate new hampshire republican 
also has been a political patron

us supreme court nominee david souter 
issued a ruling on the new hampshire supreme court that could be 
seen as arguing that doctors should be free to decide whether to 
counsel women about abortions 
souter agreed with and issued a concurring opinion in a 1986 
case in which the court said it would not recognize a right not to 
be born 
the ruling dealt with a womans lawsuit against her doctor 
charging that he did not advise her of the possibility that the 
german measles she contracted during pregnancy would result in 
birth defects 
her daughter was born with multiple birth defects and she 
argued that she should have known of the possibility and been 
counseled about the possibility of abortion 
in a unanimous decision the court ruled that it had no business 
deciding whether such a child would be better off having been 
aborted but it did rule that the parents of children with birth 
defects have a right to sue 
it also held that doctors have a responsibility to test for 
birth defects and inform pregnant women of the possibility of 
defects to give them the option of abortion 
we recognize that the termination of pregnancy involves 
controversial and divisive social issues said the opinion with 
which souter agreed nonetheless the supreme court of the united 
states has held that a woman has a constitutionally secured right 
to terminate a pregnancy 
the mother linda smith also made her daughter heather a 
plaintiff but the court rejected the childs suit saying the 
right to life and the principle that all are equal under the law 
are basic to our constitutional order to presume to decide that 
heathers life is not worth living would be to forsake these 
ideals 
souter agreed with the ruling and raised an additional question 
in a concurring opinion he wondered what impact the ruling might 
have on doctors who dont support abortion but who were bound to 
advise patients of it as an alternative the court did not address 
the question 
the court does not hold that some or all physicians must make 
a choice between rendering services that they morally condemn and 
leaving their profession in order to escape malpractice 
exposures he wrote 
he suggested that such doctors might tell patients of their 
religious or moral scruples and refer them to other doctors in time 
for such testing

vapors of a cleaning solvent leaking from 
equipment used to mix chemicals led to the deadly explosions and 
fire that rocked a chemical plant last week a fire investigator 
said 
capt jim mara said monday that a reactor in the resin building 
of the basf corp plant was being cleaned with a chemical solvent 
known as px when a valve apparently ruptured and released the vapor 
cloud into the building 
investigators still do not know what then ignited the vapor and 
triggered the explosion mara said 
but we know the reactor or kettle as its known was 
overpressurized either through mechanical error or human error 
he said 
a series of blasts at the plant thursday killed one worker and 
injured at least 68 others many of them residents of the 
surrounding neighborhood who were cut by flying glass three people 
remained in critical condition today 
a maintenance foreman at the plant who set off a fire alarm 
seconds before the first blast said he was alerted by a cloud of 
vapor escaping from the building where the company handled resins 
used in paints and coatings for aluminum food cans 
we know it was the reactor in the resin building and we know 
there was a vapor cloud mara said the ignition source could 
be a hard call because there are several possibilities 
he refused to speculate on the cause 
assistant fire chief james ross said damage from the fire has 
been set at 50 million 
mara said the fact that the first blast struck at about 215 
pm was in part responsible for the low death toll 
most of the people who work in that area went on break at 2 
pm he said the call came in at 219 pm there could have 
been at least nine people maybe more in the immediate area if 
they hadnt been on break 
occupational safety and health administration officials have 
begun interviewing survivors

batteredwoman syndrome and posttraumatic stress disorder 
ive heard a lot about him that he was not a good person

a congressional panel asked a special 
prosecutor today to broaden his probe of former housing secretary 
samuel pierce saying it has evidence pierce steered money to 
clients of his former law firm and may have committed perjury 
in urging independent counsel arlin adams to expand his 
investigation the house government operations housing subcommittee 
said its 14monthlong probe uncovered widespread abuses 
influence peddling blatant favoritism monumental waste and gross 
mismanagement at hud 
the subcommittee specifically asked adams to widen his 
investigation into three areas of possible wrongdoing 
whether pierce committed perjury during the only appearance 
before the subcommittee on may 25 1989 in which the former 
cabinet officer gave detailed testimony the congressional panel 
said many of pierces statements were contradicted by subsequent 
testimony pierce essentially maintained that he did not play a 
direct role in the awarding of housing projects 
whether pierce conspired with others to steer hud business to 
clients of battle fowler jaffin and kheel the wall street law 
firm where pierce formerly had been a partner it also questions 
whether pierce conspired with his former top aide lance wilson in 
connection with contract awards 
whether pierce and other hud officials conspired to defraud 
the government in the handling of the department of housing and 
urban developments coinsurance program which provided backing for 
housing development projects during the reagan administration from 
198189 
the letter came as the eightmember panel neared an end to its 
investigation of the hud scandal a subcommittee source discussing 
the panels role on grounds of anonymity said no more hearings are 
scheduled the aide said the subcommittee hopes to complete a final 
report with recommendations for reforms at hud sometime in late 
august 
the letter said documents found in hud files show that pierces 
former law firm frequently sought pierces assistance in 
hudrelated matters it said they included having pierce meet with 
a client to discuss a development grant application and helping 
securing lucrative housing subsidies 
it cited a letter from a partner in the firm to pierces 
assistant deborah gore dean in 1985 seeking her help in obtaining 
a subsidy for an amherst ny project and recounting past 
assistance in another project there allenhurst apartments 
in light of secretary pierces long and close relationship 
with his former law firm battle fowler it defies logic and 
reason that ms dean would have assisted battle fowler in 
obtaining these scarce and muchindemand subsidy units for the 
allenhurst project on her own without the direct and intimate 
involvement of secretary pierce the letter said 
pierce was expected to return to the firm but has instead spent 
much of the past year working with a team of lawyers defending 
himself against allegations of favoritism raised by the 
subcommittee and now adams 
thousands of pages of hud documents released through the freedom 
of information act last year included dozens of letters from 
battle fowler lawyers to top pierce aides but the law firm and 
pierce through his attorneys have denied any favoritism 
several members of the subcommittee including chairman tom 
lantos dcalif have repeatedly said pierce may have committed 
perjury during a may 1989 appearance before the panel 
at that appearance the former secretary portrayed himself as a 
handsoff manager and said he took no direct role in funding 
decisions subsequent witnesses and documents released after pierce 
testified indicated that pierce had indeed played major roles in 
numerous funding decisions including several for projects 
involving associates or prominent republicans 
pierces lawyers have said their review of the testimony and 
documents indicated no wrongdoing by pierce 
pierce again appeared before the subcommittee and vehemently 
denied any wrongdoing while accusing the panel of targeting him for 
criticism and investigation but pierce refused to answer 
questions invoking his fifth amendment protection against possible 
selfincrimination 
the silence of pierce and several former top aides who also 
refused to testify has left many questions unanswered 15 months 
after huds inspector general set of a firestorm by releasing a 
report that concluded the departments costly moderate 
rehabilitation program was riddled with mismanagement and political 
favoritism 
acting on a request from congress attorney general dick 
thornburgh in march sought and won the court appointment of adams 
at that time adams a former federal judge was charged with 
investigating the role of pierce and top aides in the moderate 
rehabilitation program 
since then adams jurisdiction has been broadened to include 
pierces administration of urban development action grants and the 
secretarys discretionary fund for technical assistance and other 
special projects

death by soldiers during the first four weeks of the 1968 
sovietled military invasion according to a declassified 
government report published today

which said only five top communist party officials had been privy 
to it immediately after the invasion the invasion crushed attempts 
at democratic reforms in czechoslovakia 
the first shootings occurred near the city of liberec about 65 
miles north of prague the paper reported 
during the occupation of czechoslovakia by the armies of the

wall street may have mended many of its ways 
since the excessive 1980s but it still hasnt found an antidote 
for the blue monday syndrome 
the tendency for volatile selloffs to occur right after weekends 
repeated itself monday when the dow jones industrial average fresh 
from a series of runs at record highs above 3000 points took its 
worst plunge in six months 
the average an index of stocks in 30 of the countrys 
bestknown industrial corporations dropped more than 100 points in 
the first 90 minutes of trading then fluctuated through much of 
the day in heavy trading at the close it was down 5644 points 
or 19 percent at 290470 
the selloff wiped out a big chunk of the earlysummer gains 
posted by some of the nations most prominent bluechip stocks and 
analysts placed much of the blame on a rash of disappointing 
corporate earnings 
other catalysts for the fall they said ranged from revived 
fears of higher interest rates to continued anxiety over the 
federal deficit 
this morning the dow industrial average traded within a narrow 
range it was up 050 at 290520 at 11 am on wall street an 
hour earlier the average sported a gain of 570 points 
although worrisome analysts said mondays drop did not seem to 
presage a crisis on the magnitude of the crash of october 1987 or 
minicrash of october 1989 
companies as diverse as american telephone amp telegraph dow 
chemical and us shoe posted earnings below expectations for the 
quarter ended june 30 late last week texas instruments and a slew 
of computer and technology companies also announced disappointing 
profits 
investors initially treated the profit reports as individual 
cases dumping shares of the companies involved while leaving other 
stocks unscathed the dow kept making new highs benefiting from 
enthusiasm for a few of its component issues 
but on monday morning investors urge to sell broadened 
causing what analyst michael metz at oppenheimer amp co called a 
minipanic 
newton zinder at shearson lehman hutton inc said people who 
concentrated on the dow jones industrial average at 3000 got a 
misleading picture there had been an underlying erosion over the 
last few weeks with a lot of stocks falling into black holes after 
their earnings were released 
in midjuly the federal reserve took a step toward easier 
credit when chairman alan greenspan declared his intention to keep 
the financial system supplied with ample money while the banking 
industry retrenched and regrouped 
but after an initial burst of enthusiasm over that news both 
the bond and stock markets turned wary 
on monday many observers saw evidence of continued worries over 
what jolts the economy still might suffer in the unwinding of the 
debt boom of the 80s 
a rising tide of debt even if unsound immoral or fattening 
is bullish observes james grant in the current issue of his 
newsletter grants interest rate observer having borrowed money

the government concerned that the one skill the 
industrious japanese have yet to master is how to relax is 
offering advice on how hard workers can become happy campers 
the health and welfare ministry this week released a 38page 
report titled a study on how to take proper rest and 
recuperation it suggests japanese forget about their jobve the office 
and take leisurely and lengthy vacations 
concepts wellrooted in the west but yet to take hold here 
to help the nation relax the government report offers a wide 
range os when 
they leaf general guidelines 
for example it argues that constant overtime work cuts down on 
sleep adversely affects the quality of work and results in 
chronic fatigue physically and mentally eventually leading to 
bad health and illness 
the report advises workers to go to bed early and get up 
early take breakfast without fail forget about the job after 
hours and eat dinner with their families 
whitecollar japanese workers often eat and drink with 
colleagues after leaving the office and do not get home until late 
at night 
according to government statistics japanese workers are on the 
job an average of 2150 hours a year compared with 1924 hours in 
the united states and 1655 hours in wuter train 
route from montreals southern suburbs 
on saturday night two men carried the same sign that led 
fridays procession showing indians on horseback chasing a train 
the men toted the sign away from the barricade hoping to whip 
up another mass march only a dozen people follow this time and 
the feeble procession trailed off into a gas station parking lot 
two other men carried a cloth banner showing a mohawk in 
feathers with a slash through his face 
one man in a tweed jacket and maroon tie stood out in the crowd 
of people in shorts and tshirts he marched through the mob 
carrying a sign in french that reads give them what they want 
the war 
the indians steal the show saturday night 
they set fire to a pile of tires creating a wall of flame in 
front of their barricade that spits a monstrous black cloud over 
the town a smoke signal to let police and townsfolk know theyre 
still there 
the crowd in chateauguay responds with an indian war cry 
occasionally they can see the silhouette of a mohawk dancing 
behind the flames 
the mob surges forward and the line of police in riot gear 
stiffens bracing for another rush on the barricade but a few 
sprinkles of rain begin falling and the crowd begins scurrying for 
their cars by 1 am just a handful of people are left 
they will return again sunday night for more junk food and 
another march that winds up back where it began

mayor marion barrys chauffeur testified today 
that he drove barry straight from a ribboncutting ceremony to a 
city meeting without stopping at a building where prosecutors say 
he picked up drugs 
walter bracey who has served as the mayors driver for 12 
years testified in barrys drug and perjury trial that he 
transported the mayor directly from the opening of a grocery store 
to a meeting with fire officials on the morning of sept 7 1988 
prosecution witness lydia reid pearson an acknowledged drug 
dealer has testified she handed barry crack cocaine and a city job 
application at a city municipal building shortly after 10 am that 
day 
but bracey testified that barry arrived at the ribboncutting 
ceremony at about 940 am spent about 45 minutes there and then 
was driven straight to the fire department meeting 
were there any stops made at any other location barry 
attorney r kenneth mundy asked 
no bracey replied 
earlier a grocery store employee and a member of a community 
group who attended the grand opening testified that barry spent 
about 45 minutes there before leaving 
braceys testimony came on the second day of an assault by mundy 
on pearsons credibility 
pearson originally testified that she has not used cocaine since 
june 8 but with the jury out of the courtroom monday mundy called 
her back to the stand and asked whether she had visited an 
apartment building known as a crack house on july 7 
pearson acknowledged that the building is recognized as a place 
where drugs are sold but she denied visiting there 
minutes earlier with the jury also out of the courtroom a city 
police officer otha batts testified that he had seen pearson 
visit the building 
pearson testified earlier in barrys drug and perjury trial that 
she went to city offices on sept 7 1988 where she met the mayor 
and handed him crack cocaine he gave me the money for 
it and i gave him a job application 
mundy said he intended to repeat his questions to both the 
police officer and pearson before the jury but us district judge 
thomas penfield jackson said he will not allow the defense to 
pursue that course unless he is first shown a legal precedent for 
such a move 
mundy promised to research the matter and present an answer 
the questioning of pearson followed testimony by a city 
employee clifton roberson that he and not barry accepted a 
job application from the woman on sept 7 1988 
roberson said he saw no evidence of drugs when pearson visited 
his office he also said he recalled that pearson was upset because 
she was forced to wait for almost 20 minutes before being informed 
that neither barry nor mayoral aide anita bonds was present 
roberson said pearson gave him the job application and then left 
pearsons testimony for sept 7 1988 forms the basis for one 
of 10 cocaine possession charges with which barry is charged he 
also is accused of one misdemeanor conspiracy count and three 
felony counts of lying to a grand jury

doubling the tax on wine as a 
deficitreduction measure would cost state and local governments 32 
cents for every 1 collected by the federal government an industry 
group said tuesday 
lower business profits and lost wages would reduce tax 
collections of state and local governments by an estimated 81 
million the wine coalition said 
doubling taxes on wine and beer is said to be under 
consideration by congressional leaders and the bush administration 
as part of a longrange plan to reduce the budget deficit 
a study commissioned by the industry group concluded that the 
higher tax would reduce us wine consumption by about 4 percent to 
500 million gallons a year reduce business activity by 11 
billion and cost workers in wine and related industries 293 
million a year in lost wages 
wines are subject to federal taxes ranging from 17 cents a 
gallon for table wine to 340 a gallon for naturally sparkling 
the levy brought in 270 million last year

youve heard of pennies from heaven would 
you believe enough to buy a new car 
thats roughly how much money robert and mildred eichstadt got 
recently for selling a 160pound meteorite found on their land nine 
years ago 
the couple wont say exactly how much they were paid by marlin 
cilz a collector from malta mont but mrs eichstadt says it was 
a large amount and agrees that comparing it to the price of a 
new small car is fair 
its probably the best crop we ever took off of our farm 
she said 
the meteorite about the size of two basketballs was found on 
their farm in eastern south dakota near huron by their oldest 
son bruce when the disc harrow he was using to prepare a field 
caught the object and rolled it over 
bruce knew right away what it was said mrs eichstadt he 
said it was a meteorite that it couldnt be a rock its so hard 
it just made a shiny spot on it where the disc hit it 
the eichstadts had no idea it had any value so they let it sit 
in their yard 
but they began looking to sell it a few months ago after they 
saw information about cilz in a farm publication 
when cilz made the eichstadts an offer their reaction was 
this cant be happening to us said mrs eichstadt as soon 
as we found out it had some value we didnt have it setting out 
in the yard any longer 
cilz estimated that the meteorite fell on the land that is now 
the eichstadts farm about 2200 years ago 
mrs eichstadt says cilz indicated the meteorite likely will be 
cut into pieces to be sold to collectors

as many as 300 lightning strikes were 
recorded in alaskas interior since midnight complicating efforts 
to battle wildfires that have charred 125 million acres of timber 
and tundra so far this month 
the weather service says the thunderstorms wont bring much 
rain trish hogervorstrukke of the fire information center in 
fairbanks said today 
nearly all of the 129 fires raging in alaska on monday were 
caused by lightning the same conditions that create thunderstorms 
bring erratic winds that cause problems to firefighting crews 
hogervorstrukke said 
it can send the fires back toward them she said 
the cost of fighting fires this season in alaska has topped 
215 million said rj hayes a spokesman for the alaska 
interagency fire information center in fairbanks 
thats up from about 15 million two weeks ago and dwarfs the 
states initial firefighting budget of about 3 million for the 
season and not all the fires are being fought 
dense smoke has hampered fire crews and cut visibility to less 
than a mile interrupting air and ground travel in parts of 
alaskas interior 
i havent turned a prop yet today said walt walton owner 
of an airtaxi service in the kuskokwim river community of mcgrath 
225 miles northwest of anchorage visibility there monday was 
onehalf mile he said 
motorists on the taylor highway near the alaskacanada border 
encountered periodic delays because of poor visibility 
state highway officials advised motorists not to drive the 
twolane dalton highway north of fairbanks the 24000acre hess 
creek fire was burning within two miles of the road that parallels 
the transalaska pipeline between prudhoe bay and the town of 
livengood 
officials said the pipeline buried in the vicinity of the fire 
wasnt threatened 
health centers in some interior communities reported treating 
more people with scratchy throats and watery eyes caused by the 
smoke 
however concentrations do not exceed ambient air quality 
standards and probably wont said jack coutts of the state 
department of environmental conservation in fairbanks 
the interruption of lightaircraft flights had repercussions in 
some communities not served by roads mail delivery was interrupted 
out of mcgrath and walton was two days overdue picking up clients 
he had flown to a remote hunting camp in the alaska range 
no one has been injured in the fires and few dwellings have been 
lost officials said

a huge bomb exploded today on 
the outskirts of the border city of armagh killing a roman 
catholic nun and three policeman police said 
the murder of the nun was thought to be the first time a nun has 
been killed in 21 years of sectarian violence in britishrun 
northern ireland 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility but suspicion 
immediately fell on the irish republican army the killing of a nun 
would be seen widely as a grave embarrassment to the mainly 
catholic ira 
the bomb blew apart an unmarked police car instantly killing 
the three officers traveling in it police sources said 
the nun who died later in hospital from severe injuries was 
traveling with a woman social worker in a separate car caught in 
the blast jim cantwell of the catholic press and information 
office said 
he said he could not identify the nun until her family had been 
notified 
police and troops rushed reinforcements to the area near the 
border with the republic of ireland the area is considered prime 
territory for operations by the outlawed ira 
the blast was the deadliest terrorist attack in the province 
since an ira bomb april 9 killed four soldiers of the locally 
recruited ulster defense regiment 
paul corr who owns a gas station near the killylea road where 
the bomb exploded said the ground shook beneath us and it was 
accompanied by a very large explosion 
we were first on the scene and saw a white mini metro with two 
young lassies in their 20s in the car unconscious corr told 
reporters 
the ambulance then arrived and they managed to get them out 
it wasnt until then that we saw the police car on the opposite 
side of the hedge buried in there 
the bomb which blasted a crater in the twolane road was 
apparently detonated by a timer device or by guerrillas lying in 
wait police sources said 
politicians and church leaders expressed outrage 
this is one more example that when terrorists want to do 
something they do it in an indiscriminate manner and it doesnt 
matter what happens to others said the most rev robin eames 
the anglican primate of ireland 
the blast occurred two miles outside armagh the ancient 
religious capital of ireland and seats of the heads of the catholic 
and anglican churches throughout ireland north and south 
seamus mallon deputy leader of northern irelands main catholic 
political party the social democratic and labor party described 
the attack as wanton and brutal savagery 
that is four more murders to add to the spiral of murders we 
have had over this past 20 years said mallon but it is not 
just that it is four more families bereaved four more families 
having this type of suffering heaped upon them 
nearly 3000 people have been killed since protestantcatholic 
violence erupted in northern ireland in 1969 and the british 
government sent in troops 
the ira is fighting a guerrilla campaign to end british rule and 
unite protestantdominated northern ireland with the republic of 
ireland under a leftist administration

ten leatherback turtles will be 
fitted with transmitters and tracked in international waters with 
the help of nasa satellites an official said 
fisheries department director general shahrom abdul majid said 
monday the project would provide accurate information on the 
movements of the giant leatherback turtles between their annual 
nestings in malaysia 
scientists say the species which has been around for an 
estimated 150 million years is facing extinction due to pollution 
and pilfering of their eggs which are a delicacy in malaysia 
the turtles measure up to 5 feet in diameter can weigh 900 lbs 
and live for about 100 years 
majid said malaysia will be the third country after french 
guiana and the united states to use this system the national news 
agency bernama reported 
he was speaking after launching the project at rantau abang the 
site of the turtles annual nesting migration 
the program involves using nasa satellites to relay signals 
emitted by a platform transmitter terminal on the back of each 
turtle to ground stations the project cost 27000 
the turtles roam the seas around japan the philippines and 
australia but return annually to rantau abang 180 miles northeast 
of the capital of kuala lumpur between june to august to lay their 
eggs 
in the 1950s between 1700 and 2000 of the turtles came ashore 
annually but their numbers dwindled to about 500 per year during 
the past few years and to only about 60 last year government 
officials said

the iraqi government accused kuwait today 
of conspiring against it with the united states diplomats said the 
neighbors tense confrontation has been aggravated by iraqs 
massing of troops on kuwaits border 
the border buildup began last week and coincided with a verbal 
assault on kuwait by iraqs president and threats of military 
action 
the pentagon today announced that us navy ships are holding a 
shortnotice exercise with forces of the united arab emirates 
in the persian gulf area 
pete williams a pentagon spokesman told reporters in 
washington said he could provide no details on the exercise beyond 
saying that it began monday and that two navy vessels left early 
from their port at bahrain in order to participate 
williams declined to comment on the purpose of the maneuvers or 
say whether they were scheduled before iraqi president saddam 
hussein accused kuwait of stealing 24 billion worth of oil from 
wells iraqi territory and of trying to wreck the iraqi economy by 
conspiring by push down world oil prices 
the oil in question comes from the rumaila field on land near 
an unmarked part of the border that is claimed by both kuwait and 
iraq 
diplomatic sources in bahrain said the us navy was on alert 
they also said a washington post report of 30000 iraqi troops 
massed at its southern border with kuwait appeared to be correct 
williams would not comment on the washington post report which 
said the us navy had canceled shore leaves for its forces in the 
persian gulf the report quoted western military attaches 
white house spokesman mrlin fitzwater said of the situation 
today were concerned about the troop buildup by iraq and we ask 
that all parties strive to avoid violence 
diplomats in iraq and persian gulf states said that soon after 
iraqkuwait dispute erupted travelers saw battlefield missiles 
armored personel carriers and tanks prominently displayed along the 
road from iraq to kuwait 
kuwait put its forces on alert for several days but the 
diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity said the alert was 
canceled to defuse tension kuwaits entire armed forces has just 
20300 men 
the united states has at least seven warships in the persian 
gulf at any given moment the state department announced at the 
beginning of the crisis that it backs kuwaits territorial 
integrity 
during the iraniraq war some kuwaiti tankers flew the american 
flag as protection from attacks in the gulf 
baghdad kept up the verbal assaults on kuwait today 
the government newspaper aljoumhouriya accused kuwait of 
coordinating its moves with the united states in order to clear 
the way for foreign powers to intervene in the area 
it also accused kuwait of ignoring arab solidarity by demanding 
repayment of loans made to support iraq during the iraniraq war 
the kuwaiti government should have written off all the debts 
at the moment iraq asked it to do so the paper said 
kuwait lent iraq an estimated 15 billion during the war out of 
a total 70 billion iraq is believed to have borrowed 
the attempts to repay the debt and rebuild the economy are 
putting massive financial pressure on iraq which is trying to 
rebuild following its 198088 war with iran 
diplomats called the iraqi moves brinksmanship and did not 
expect iraq to invade kuwait but the reports sent jitters through 
world financial markets 
in tokyo the dollar strengthened against the japanese yen today 
over news of the increasing unrest prompting traders to buy the 
currency regarded as a safe haven 
the dispute will overshadow a strategy meeting of ministers from 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries which begins 
wednesday in geneva 
the iraqi president last week threatened to use force if 
necessary against countries pumping more oil than they opec quotas 
although saddam did not mention names he clearly was angry at 
kuwait and the united arab emirates the two nations have 
persistently ignored their opec prooduction limits sending a flood 
of crude onto the market and lowering oil prices 
saddam claimed iraq had lost 14 billion in revenues in the past 
year because of falling crude prices due to the oil glut

pacific island leaders and environmental groups 
are raising concerns about the armys plan to store and destroy 
chemical weapons at johnston atoll 800 miles southwest of here 
i think its a very bad decision based on undue haste skip 
spaulding an attorney for the sierra club legal defense fund in 
hawaii said monday the army seems more concerned with carrying 
out its mission for its commander in chief than thoroughly 
assessing the consequences 
the pacific must not become the dumping ground for the worlds 
chemical agents and munitions hawaii gov john waihee said last 
week 
the us weapons from west germany would add 100000 rounds to 
the 300000 rounds of nerve and mustard gas stored at the remote 
island since 1971 
the transport of the munitions from west germany will begin 
thursday and would continue through september pentagon spokesman 
pete williams said tuesday containers holding the weapons will be 
loaded onto navy ships for transport to the pacific 
the containers will be put in storage on johnston atoll until 
the army finishes testing an incinerator for the munitions the 
tests are to be completed late next year and fullscale 
destruction is not expected to begin until 1992 
the army said moving the weapons and destroying them at johnston 
atoll would have minimal public health safety and environmental 
effects 
safety of people and nations and protection of the environment 
is foremost in our minds said john fairbank a spokesman for the 
army western command in honolulu 
the good part is we are in fact destroying a very unpopular 
weapon fairbank said the end result when we get through is 
all of the weapons will be destroyed we think the 
environmentalists should cheer that goal 
theres been little cheering 
transporting the european stockpile halfway around the world 
inescapably increases the risks said a statement issued by the 
federated states of micronesia a former us territory 
leaders of the marshall islands cook islands new zealand and 
the us territory of american samoa also have expressed 
reservations about the plan 
while most of the leaders have said they support destruction of 
the weapons they said they worry about the environmental dangers 
of transporting the weapons across the pacific and destroying them 
at johnston atoll 
the pacific council of churches representing 26 protestant and 
roman catholic churches in the south pacific asked the army to 
cancel the move the hawaii legislature and honolulu city council 
also have objected 
spaulding said the sierra club legal defense club was planning 
legal action to halt the shipment of the weapons until officials 
have fully assessed the dangers 
the problem with johnston atoll is this is an unproven 
technology spaulding said it hasnt been tested enough to 
prove its safe 
fairbanks responded that the army has tested the incineration 
technology this isnt something that were just jumping off and 
doing all of a sudden he said 
he agreed that the safest way to get rid of the weapons is to 
destroy them in place however he said we could not do that in 
germany because they are our munitions on foreign soil and weve 
agreed to remove them 
fairbank emphasized that the weapons at johnston atoll combined 
with the weapons from west germany represent about 6 percent of the 
united states chemical weapons he said the army has no plans to 
use johnston atoll to destroy munitions from mainland storage sites 
the 240 million disposal system was built to meet a 1985 
congressional requirement to destroy all us chemical weapons by 
1997 
the army began testing the incinerator on june 30

president bush said today the supreme 
court must be guided by independent minds and there there should 
be no litmus test in the senate confirmation of nominee david 
h souter 
bush addressing a pennsylvania state republican fundraising 
luncheon said my sole priority was to appoint a justice true to 
the life and the spirit of the constitution a priority that im 
confident will also guide the congress in the confirmation 
process 
without mentioning abortion or other divisive matters bush 
said there was no single issue no litmus test on standards 
dominating my decision to nominate 
i would add there should be no litmus test in the process of 
confirmation bush said 
the speech was bushs first since his surprisingly quick 
decision monday to tap the little known federal appeals judge from 
new hampshire for the vacancy left by the retirement of 84yearold 
justice william j brennan 
bush was also journeying to new york later for another gop rally 
the supreme court must be guided by independent minds and its 
members are appointed for life largely to keep them above the 
flames of political passion bush told 400 people at the gop 
luncheon 
he called souter a great man of enormous intelligence 
strength a tough trial court judge with a great legal mind and an 
impartial quality that will serve the court well 
before leaving washington bush huddled with the five top 
republican and democratic leaders of congress on the budget summit 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said they agreed to cool 
partisan rhetoric in an effort to forge an agreement to hold down 
next years estimated 169 billion deficit 
but bush still took a few swipes at what he called the democrats

cambodias khmer rouge guerrillas 
stung by a us move to isolate the group on tuesday appealed for 
world support to help end cambodias civil war 
khmer rouge leader khieu samphan in a statement over khmer 
rouge army radio said the guerrillas must have a role in any peace 
settlement 
it was the groups first reaction to the us decision to 
withdraw its recognition of the un seat held by the guerrilla 
coalition the united states citing its opposition to the khmer 
rouge said last wednesday it will instead open talks with vietnam 
on ending the cambodian war 
vietnam ousted the communist khmer rouge from power in late 
1978 the khmer rouge is now joined in a resistance coalition with 
the noncommunist forces of prince norodom sihanouk and with son 
sanns khmer peoples national liberation front 
together they are fighting the government installed by vietnam 
the us move was prompted by reports of strong military gains by 
the khmer rouge who killed hundreds of thousands of people during 
their 197578 rule of cambodia 
khieu samphan noted the support given to the resistance by other 
countries including the sixmember association of southeast asian 
nations 
the cambodian people also ask them to continue providing 
steadfast assistance and support until the vietnamese war of 
aggression against cambodia is comprehensively settled in 
conformity with the spirit and principle of the un charter he 
said 
asean comprises thailand malaysia indonesia singapore the 
philippines and brunei asean foreign ministers in indonesia for 
an annual consultations said monday that attempts to change 
cambodias un seat at this time would set back the search for a 
comprehensive political solution 
china the main arms supplier for the resistance and 
particularly the khmer rouge has said it will continue its backing 
despite the us policy shift 
but china agrees with other members of the un security council 
that there should be a unmonitored halt to all outside arms 
supplies once a political solution is reached the us assistant 
secretary of state for asian affairs richard solomon said in 
washington late monday 
in the radio broadcast khieu samphan said that only with the 
participation of all four parties can there be genuine national 
reconciliation and can we correctly implement international law and 
the un charter which says that the people of each country have 
the right to decide their own destiny 
he noted the vast majority of the un members supported the 
guerrilla coalitions seat the position is to ensure that the 
un charter and international law prevail over the law of the 
jungle and the use of force he said 
vietnam said it withdrew the last of its soldiers from cambodia 
in late september before elections for a new government are held 
the khmer rouge wants an interim coalition representing each of the 
warring parties installed 
the cambodian government wants the interim power and says any 
settlement must include measures to prevent a khmer rouge return to 
power 
many cambodians hate and fear the khmer rouge but many citizens 
give the guerrillas food and other aid during operations deep in 
the country 
khieu samphan said the guerrillas battlefield victories have 
proved they have been supported by the people

a ruling that a countys voting districts 
should be redrawn to increase black voting strength was overturned 
by a federal appeals court panel tuesday because the lawsuit was 
filed too late 
the ruling was a setback for the american civil liberties union 
which has sought redistricting to increase black voter strength in 
about 18 virginia localities 
the plaintiffs black voters in brunswick county in southern 
virginia probably will appeal their lawyer said were 
incredibly disappointed and we think the decision was very 
inappropriate said the attorney gerald t zerkin 
the ruling by a threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court 
of appeals overturned an order by us district judge james r 
spencer that the countys voting districts be redrawn 
the plaintiffs delay in challenging a 1971 redistricting was 
inexcusable and unreasonable said the opinion by judge robert f 
chapman 
the appellate panel also said it would make no sense to change 
the countys voting districts just before 1990 census figures 
become available 
a courtordered reapportionment at this date would be 
completely gratuitous because there are no elections scheduled 
before november 1991 and the 1990 census figures may require 
reapportionment chapman said in the ruling joined by judges 
james m sprouse and william w wilkins jr 
if the plaintiffs believe the 1991 redistricting violates the 
us voting rights act they can file another lawsuit the judges 
said 
until tuesdays ruling the aclu has won outofcourt 
settlements or court rulings that were not appealed in nearly all 
the redistricting cases it pursued in virginia said kent willis 
director of the state aclu chapter a case against henrico county 
is pending before the 4th circuit 
brunswick county which is 57 percent black has a fivemember 
board of supervisors elected from singlemember districts four of 
the districts have populations that are more than half black but 
only two have elected black supervisors 
the board created the districts after the 1970 census and left 
them intact after the 1980 census 
the plaintiffs voiced no objection either to the 1971 
redistricting or to the 1981 decision not to redistrict and waited 
until september 1988 to file this action the appeals panel said 
the judges rejected the plaintiffs contention that the delay 
gave them information from several elections on which to base their 
claim that blacks are discriminated against in the county 
the plaintiffs in the exercise of reasonable diligence could 
have discovered at a much earlier time the facts upon which they 
now base their claim the opinion said 
zerkin protested we relied on the analysis of voting records 
that included elections in 1987 if we had brought it earlier the 
first thing they would have said is you have insufficent data 
zerkin also said the rural county has gained so few people that 
the 1990 redistricting is unlikely to produce major changes 
the net effect of this decision is that we have to start all 
over again he said 
raymond s daniel vice chairman of the brunswick county board 
of supervisors said he was pleased the ruling was in favor of 
brunswick county daniel said he had not seen the ruling and did 
not want to comment further

creating jobs in mexico and other countries is 
the only longterm way to cut illegal immigration into the united 
states a special commission told congress on tuesday 
diego c asencio a former us assistant secretary of state 
headed the 12member commission for the study of international 
migration and cooperative economic development established by 
congress in 1986 
asencio told the house foreign affairs committee that 
initially economic development encourages people to leave a 
country but he added 
promoting economic development is the proper way to proceed if 
we are serious about stemming unauthorized migration in this 
hemisphere over the long term and i must emphasize that we are 
talking about a process that will probably take decades 
the commission recommended creating an agency for migration 
affairs to take charge of refugees and immigrants 
as a young viceconsul i could never understand why one 
agency should allow immigrants to come in and another decide if 
that was all right asencio said 
consuls who work for the state department issue visas in other 
countries for entry into the united states the immigration and 
naturalization service of the justice department has authority over 
immigrants after they arrive including the authority to issue 
green cards which give the immigrants the right to work 
asencio said the first reaction he had from the state department 
was unfavorable to his proposed new agency 
some people would lose their jobs and they dont like that 
he explained 
the commission said any major decision on aid and trade for 
other countries should have with it an impact statement to show 
the effect of the decision on immigration 
the commission also recommended 
speeding creation of a free trade area with mexico and bringing 
it into the free trade area with canada 
supporting freer trade with other western hemisphere countries 
but leaving the initiative to them 
gradually letting mexico and caribbean countries make and ship 
here the cloth clothes and steel now coming from asia 
increasing sugar imports from the caribbean 
linking trade benefits to rights of workers in the exporting 
country particularly rights in the maquiladora plants along 
mexicos border that process goods for this country 
working with mexico to improve the quality of life in border 
areas

house gop whip newt gingrich said today he 
supports the censure of rep barney frank rather than the less 
severe reprimand recommended by the ethics committtee to punish the 
massachusetts democrat for using his office to help a male 
prostitute 
gingrich made clear he was not speaking for the house gop 
leadership but his position as the secondranking house republican 
could influence lawmakers wavering between a censure and the ethics 
committees recommendation of a lesser punishment a reprimand 
the georgia republican said one consequence of a censure would 
be franks automatic loss of his chairmanship of the house 
judiciary subcommittee on administrative law and governmental 
relations 
gingrich told a news conference his support for a censure had 
nothing to do with franks admittedly gay lifestyle rather he 
said censure is appropriate because frank wrote a misleading 
letter to a probation officer that was favorable to the prostitute 
who was convicted on drug and sex charges 
censure is the minimum appropriate action he said because 
lying to or misleading a court official is clearly a standard 
congress cannot accept 
gingrich said however he would not back a move to expel frank 
the case is to reach the house floor thursday 
on the other hand rep john t myers of indiana ranking 
republican on the ethics panel said he will urge house members to 
uphold the committee position for reprimanding frank an 
acknowledged homosexual 
the republican leadership planned to discuss the partys 
strategy at its regular meeting this afternoon house speaker 
thomas s foley dwash said the frank case would be considered 
on the floor thursday 
republicans could only hope to override the committee decision 
with the support of conservative democrats who will be urged by 
their own leadership to back the 120 recommendation last thursday 
by the ethics committee 
a key to the seriousness of the conservative gop effort will be 
house republican whip newt gingrich of georgia who is the leader 
of the right wing ranks he has yet to announce his position 
a reprimand would involve the house voting to approve the report 
of the ethics panel 
a censure would involve a similar vote along with the 
requirement that the member face his colleagues while the action is 
approved 
rep william e dannemeyer rcalif already has announced he 
would introduce a resolution to expel frank the expulsion 
resolution must pass by a twothirds majority and even conservative 
republicans gave dannemeyer no chance of success 
myers would not predict whether a censure resolution would pass 
but said it sure would get more voters than expulsion 
he said the reprimand proposal wasnt an easy decision to come 
to this is the compromise we worked out 
frank a liberal serving his fifth term is expected to be on 
the floor regardless of the punishment because he has promised to 
apologize to the house 
i believe the committee position will be sustained on the 
floor foley told reporters monday majority whip william h gray 
iii dpa concurred saying attempts at censure or expulsion 
will fail 
the ethics committee concluded in a report released friday that 
frank brought discredit upon the ouse in two areas of his conduct 
with male prostitute stephen l gobie 
the panel found he used his congressional status for dismissal 
of 33 parking tickets incurred by gobie while not on official 
business frank said he had employed gobie as a personal aide from 
198587 and paid him with personal funds 
the panel recommended that frank make restitution of an 
unspecified amount to the district of columbia for the tickets 
the committee also said frank also wrote a memo that wound up in 
the files of a virginia prosecutor which made misleading 
statements favorable to gobie during his probation gobie had been 
convicted on drug and sex charges 
rep robert s walker rpa said hes aware that some gop 
members are considering a censure of frank and added he would vote 
for such a proposal 
walker said a key factor for those favoring censure would be 
franks initial failure to pay social security taxes on gobies 
salary he called the issue a serious question that merits a 
penalty greater than the ethics committees recommendation

laid off defense workers would be guaranteed 
health benefits and part of their income for a year under a 7 
billion bill proposed tuesday by connecticuts two senators 
sen joseph lieberman dconn called his proposal the most 
comprehensive of several measures already under consideration in 
congress this year the legislation cosponsored by sen 
christopher dodd dconn would guarantee laid off workers a basic 
level of income help companies shift to nonmilitary production 
and provide aid to affected communities 
the changing nature of foreign threats will dictate some 
reduction in defense spending lieberman said during a news 
conference but we must not embark on wholesale cuts in defense 
programs that destroy important parts of our economy and jeopardize 
our national security 
he said defense workers are veterans of the cold war whose 
efforts helped lead to peace between the superpowers 
the lawmakers said the bill could affect millions nationwide who 
hold defense industry jobs 
this thing reaches from the bath iron works in maine to san 
diego and very few places in between are left untouched dodd 
said 
the proposal would use up to 10 percent of the socalled peace 
dividend money saved through defense spending reductions in 
each of the next seven years met with widespread publicity seemingly out 
of proportion to their impact on the traveling public and american 
spokesman tim smith said i think because of that coverage the 
impact on competition of these surcharges would have gone beyond 
the dollar amount of these costs 
american had estimated the higher fees at the airports would add 
4 million a year to expenses 
although the carrier earned 730 million last year smith said 
4 million is still a lot of money when you feel that it is 
unfair 
the bottom line was not an impact on this he said it was 
an attempt to take action against something that was unfair in our 
mind 
however no other carrier had moved to match the surcharges and 
smith said we cannot ignore competition you cant sacrifice 
competitive advantage for an idea thats not working or might not 
work 
the reversal was the second time this year american has failed 
in an attempt to influence fares 
in march american announced plans to implement a mileagebased 
fare system but ditched the plans after no other carriers followed 
suit

the senate intelligence committee has voted to 
slash aid for the afghan rebels reflecting growing congressional 
disenchantment with proxy wars around the world officials said 
tuesday 
sen frank murkowski ralaska a member of the panel said the 
main rationale for the move was that the united states had achieved 
its purpose in afghanistan when soviet troops withdrew in february 
1989 
some senators also were concerned about reports that the rebels 
known as the mujahedeen were overlooking narcotics trafficking 
in the region murkowski said 
several conservatives along with a state department official 
said they hoped money would be restored to higher levels before 
work is finished on the bill that includes 1991 money for covert 
actions around the world 
the level of appropriation is not yet decided said sen 
gordon humphrey rnh a staunch supporter of the rebels there 
are many steps in the process and those that are concerned have 
high hopes for full funding he said 
murkowski said he wasnt present at the intelligence committee 
meeting when members voted to cut secret aid for the afghan rebels 
in fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 but he said the vote on the 
democratcontrolled panel was not close 
murkowski along with several other senators refused to 
discuss dollar amounts but a congressional source speaking on 
condition of anonymity said he understood the panel reduced 
funding for the rebels by about 100 million last fall congress 
reportedly appropriated roughly 300 million for the rebels for 
fiscal 1990 
despite the withdrawal of soviet troops fighting has continued 
between the moscowbacked government of afghan president najibullah 
and the usbacked rebels for control of the mountainous country 
ussoviet negotiations are underway in an effort to set up 
internationally supervised elections meantime a state department 
official said moscow spends roughly 300 million a month to 
maintain the najibullah government sending in food fuel and 
advanced weapons such as scud missiles 
what congress appropriates has been less than 10 percent as to 
what the soviets do one official said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the senate panels action comes at a time many members of 
congress are questioning continued funding for usfinanced 
guerrilla wars in afghanistan cambodia and angola those questions 
have been prompted by the easing of eastwest tensions as well as a 
shrinking defense budget 
the senate intelligence panel also voted on june 28 to eliminate 
a 13 million covert military aid program for the rebels opposing 
the sovietbacked government of cambodia 
some lawmakers also have criticized aid to guerrilla fighters in 
angola where efforts are under way to reach a peace between the 
marxistbacked government and rebels headed by jonas savimbi 
meanwhile rep anthony beilenson dcalif chairman of the 
house intelligence committee said the panel has postponed 
consideration of the 1991 covert action budget until after 
congress august recess 
the panel was under no time pressure to finish the budget he 
said adding that in the next six or seven weeks maybe 
negotiations will work in hot spots around the world 
beilenson said there was some sentiment on the panel to close 
down usfinanced wars in some cases 
on a more general note beilenson said he generally favors more 
open discussion of us military aid programs

the average us restaurant tip is just under 
12 percent and foodservers are dodging taxes on as much as 
twothirds of it the internal revenue service said tuesday 
employees of restaurants with 10 or fewer workers are reporting 
only 1 of every 3 received in tips marshall washburn deputy 
assistant irs commissioner told the house ways and means social 
security subcommittee waiters in larger restaurants are reporting 
half their tips he said 
those figures are up significantly from 1982 when the 
disclosure that only 16 percent of tips were reported to tax 
collectors prompted congress to toughen the law on tips 
under the new law washburn said voluntarily reported tips rose 
by 16 billion in 1984 alone federal tax collections on tip 
income rose by more than 1 billion in the three years ending in 
1986 
the 1982 law requires tipped employees of larger restaurants to 
prove it if they claim to have received tips averaging less than 8 
percent employees are also required to report tip income to their 
employers and the employers to pass that information on to the irs 
the subject of tuesdays hearing was an effort by the restaurant 
industry to repeal a newer law which requires employers to pay 
social security taxes on all an employees tips up to 51300 a 
year the employee pays a matching amount 
before the law was changed in 1987 the employer paid social 
security taxes only on an amount equal to the minimum wage which 
today would be 7904 
rob haimson a greeley colo restaurateur speaking for the 
national restaurant association said the 1987 law should be 
changed because it penalizes businesses as well as employees is 
difficult to enforce and is not needed by the social security 
system 
the social security tax is a payroll tax which is intended to 
be based upon wages paid by an employer said roger branigan who 
operates a restaurant in indianapolis tips are not wages 
changing the 1987 law would require that either workers or the 
social security system pay most of an employers share of social 
security tax those options were opposed respectively by the 
hotel employees and restaurant employees union and by the american 
association of retired persons

soldiers loyal to the president fought 
off rebels and appeared in control of the city tuesday after an 
ambush on the capital insurgents launched another attack from the 
sea 
a spokesman for president samuel doe said the seaborne attack 
appeared to have been launched by a us submarine the state 
department denied the allegation 
a presidential spokesman selly thompson also told the british 
broadcasting corp in london that government troops were advancing 
against rebels in monrovia 
followers of rebel leader prince johnson penetrated the city 
center monday after wading through swampland and evading troops 
guarding bridges into town followers of charles taylor a rival 
rebel commander were blocked by government troops in the citys 
eastern suburbs taylor said he had infiltrated some men into the 
capital but only in small numbers 
taylor and johnson split sometime in the past three months and 
some foreign diplomats have said johnsons group is now stronger 
than taylors 
witnesses said an unidentified vessel approached the coastline 
in the darkness and fired at least six rounds at does mansion doe 
was believed to be inside the compound 
troops inside returned fire and the booming of cannon shots 
echoed through the city after the boat sped away one shot from 
the mansion was seen to fall harmlessly into the sea a few hundred 
yards offshore 
the damage to the heavily fortified mansion could not be 
immediately determined reporters who tried to go there or to the 
nearby ministry of information were turned back by soldiers 
later thompson read a statement to the bbc saying the mansion 
had been the target of a missile attack from the sea by what seemed 
to be a united states submarine 
the african nation founded by freed american slaves 150 years 
ago has traditionally had close ties with washington but 
washington has refused to send in a peacekeeping force and on 
saturday doe ordered the american military attache expelled 
accusing him of helping the rebels 
the united states denied the accusations it has offered to 
provide safe conduct out of the country for doe 
in washington the state department flatly denied it had fired 
on does compound 
it was not known how many soldiers were still fighting on the 
government side other than the 500 members of does presidential 
guard some government forces remained in pockets outside the 
capital but were unable to offer much help against the rebels who 
have advanced steadily since launching their siege in december 
government forces between taylors men and the capital included 
the 72nd infantry battalion and units based at schiefflin army 
base the infantry battalion was said to be putting up stiff 
resistance units at the army base had ventured out on several 
occasions to retake ground held by rebels according to reports 
from the rebel side 
troops loyal to doe patrolled monrovias streets shops were 
closed civilians searching in vain for food were harassed by 
soldiers nervous after the surprise attack monday by followers of 
prince johnson 
little is known about johnson he apparently served in the 
liberian armed forces and was a supporter of brig gen thomas 
quiwonkpa who launched a 1985 coup attempt against doe johnson 
joined up with taylor last year and was a lieutenant in the rebel 
national patriotic liberation front 
hes posing a much more formidable challenge than we 
thought one us official said of johnson 
there have been conflicting reports on whether johnson and 
taylor have reconciled 
the rebels have accused doe who took power of the nation of 24 
million people in a 1980 coup of corruption mismanagement and 
human rights abuses at least nine male bodies most of them 
stripped were found on a beach not far from the citys embassy 
district tuesday other bodies were scattered nearby witnesses 
told a photographer that soldiers had brought the people there 
during the night and summarily executed them 
does troops fearful the rebels will kill former soldiers if 
they take the capital have frequently been seen shooting 
civilians the civilians usually belong to the gio or mano tribes 
which provide the main support for taylor 
taylors soldiers have similarly executed troops belonging to 
does krahn tribe 
doe has been deserted by nearly all senior members of his 
government but had not asked the united states for help a us 
official in washington said monday 
doe has said he will not leave the besieged capital until the 
civil war has been decided sources said his presidential guard 
would not let him leave unless they were provided safe passage to 
their home territory in grand gedeh county

a senior cuban official on tuesday blamed exile 
radio stations in miami for stirring up the cubans who have sought 
asylum in foreign embassies over the past two weeks 
the vice foreign minister jose r viera demanded the 
unconditional and voluntary departure of the 25 cubans now 
being sheltered at three european embassies 
on sunday three cubans entered the swiss embassy earlier 18 
had sought refuge at the spanish embassy and four at the italian 
embassy 
viera said it is not admissible for a cuban desiring to 
emigrate to circumvent normal procedures by forcing his way into a 
foreign embassy 
if cuba acquiesced in this practice the embassies in cuba 
would not be able to function and embassies throughout the third 
world might be overrun by people wishing to emigrate viera said 
at several points during his hourlong talk viera blamed exile 
radio stations in miami for inciting the incidents at the 
embassies the first incident occurred at the czechoslovak embassy 
on july 9 
cuban reports said at least three of the exile radio stations 
can often be heard clearly in havana but the cuban reports were 
unable to substantiate vieras claims that they have been been 
encouraging cubans to seek refuge 
the reporters said one of the stations is operated by the 
cubanamerican national foundation another is run by a group 
called cuba independent and democratic they said 
viera sought to portray the incidents at the embassies as 
unrepresentative of the overall situation here 
he said the annual carnival celebration this week has been 
proceeding normally the events at the embassies have led to a 
substantial increase in security around many diplomatic missions of 
nato countries 
the highlight of the carnival celebration is a speech thursday 
by president fidel castro commemorating the 37th anniversary of his 
debut as a rebel fighter castro took power in cuba in 1959 
the incident at the spanish embassy has led to a deterioration 
in cubas relations with madrid 
while cuba has called the asylumseekers scum and habitual 
vagrants and said it will never allow them to leave the island 
spain has said it will not expel the cubans and will try instead to 
negotiate their departure 
last week reflecting escalating tensions between the two 
countries spain suspended a 25 million aid program to cuba 
recalled its ambassador and sent four guards to bolster security at 
its embassy in havana 
spains foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez had said 
castro is afraid his hardline communist government will fall like 
those in eastern europe if he allows cubans to leave fernandez 
ordonez also urged a transition to democracy in cuba 
the wave of embassy breakins began two weeks ago not long 
after similar incidents were occurring at foreign embassies in 
albania albania like cuba is a hardline communist state

the extensive paper trail of david h souters 
new hampshire supreme court tenure shows he is a clear 
dispassionate writer of legal opinions but it offers scant insight 
into his views on the vexing social issues hed face as a member of 
the nations highest court 
president bushs choice for the supreme court spent seven years 
as a member of the new hampshire high court a period in which he 
wrote nearly 200 opinions and cast votes in hundreds of other cases 
but his views on such issues as abortion civil rights and 
churchstate relations are largely or completely unknown 
a review of many of his decisions reveals souter is most 
assuredly a judicial conservative a judge who believes in 
sticking to the case at hand and shies away from making sweeping 
statements about the law 
he often sides with positions advanced by state government 
officials especially in criminal cases but there have been 
notable exceptions 
in a 1988 decision souter led the state court in declaring 
unconstitutional a state law that barred a nonprofit group from 
providing legal services to some disabled people 
the new hampshire disabilities rights center drc authorized 
by state law to provide such services to the poor sought 
permission to represent some disabled clients who were not poor 
the drcs request runs counter to the applicable state 
statutes souter said despite this conflict we hold that 
enforcement of state law to prohibit the drc as a nonprofit 
corporation from representing nonindigent clients in its advocacy 
in behalf of disabled people would violate the first and 14th 
amendments of the national constitution 
he added organizations their members and their staff lawyers 
may assert a protected first amendment right of association for 
noncommercial purposes to advocate the enforcement of legal and 
constitutional rights of those members or of others within a 
definite class whom the organization exists to serve 
in upholding the dismissal of a somersworth nh police chief 
souter said in a 1989 decision the trial court really had little 
choice but to find that the chiefs infidelity in finance and 
ineptitude in administration had rendered him incapable of holding 
a position demanding honor and integrity of its incumbent 
in a ruling earlier that year souter said a bank could not be 
held contractually liable for failing to discover poor workmanship 
on a construction project for which it had tendered loans to ross 
and virginia seymour 
the seymours responsibility for workmanship could not escape 
any reasonable reader of these documents he said the seymours 
make a further try at salvaging the contract claim by pointing 
to a loan officers alleged remark that the banks inspections 
would be a safeguard and well worth it they conveniently forget 
however that they never asked the trial court for a specific 
finding that the remark was made 
in a 1988 decision criticized by womens rights groups souter 
ordered a new trial for a man who had been convicted of sexual 
assault because his lawyers had been prevented from offering 
evidence of the complaining womans public behavior with other men 
souter said such evidence was essential to the mans defense 
that the woman had consented to having sex with him 
in a 1987 sexual assault case souter upheld a prosecutors 
closing argument comment that the defendants lawyer had failed to 
prove the victim was promiscuous 
the comment can reasonably be interpreted as nothing more than 
a response to defense counsels attempts in crossexamination and 
closing argument to present the victim as a woman of small virtue 
seeking a stranger for sexual amusement souter wrote 
in one of the rare civil rights cases in which he participated 
souter joined the state courts ruling in 1987 that said 
homosexuals may be barred from becoming adoptive or foster parents 
but the state court ruling also said that homosexuals may not be 
barred from running day care centers 
in a 1986 case souter joined the majority in ruling that 
doctors have a responsibility to test for birth defects and inform 
pregnant women of the option of abortion 
in a concurring opinion souter questioned the impact the 
decision would have on doctors who oppose abortion on moral 
grounds he said such physicians should not have to choose 
between rendering services that they morally condemn and leaving 
their profession in order to escape malpractice exposures 
souter was the lone dissenter in a 1985 state supreme court 
decision that struck down the use of police sobriety checkpoints 
the nations highest court upheld such police tactics earlier this 
year 
as new hampshires attorney general in 1978 souter defended 
gov meldrim thomsons plan to fly flags at halfstaff from all 
public buildings on good friday to commemorate the death of jesus 
christ 
souter said the governors proclamation sought to recognize 
jesus as a historical figure without endorsing christianity but as 
the states chief lawyer souter was obligated to represent the 
governor in court and he never was confronted with a similar 
churchstate issue while on the bench

in an attempt to end yearly budgettime rows over 
the royal allowance prime minister margaret thatcher said tuesday 
the royal family will receive a fixed annual increase for the next 
decade 
such an arrangement was used for about 200 years before 1975 
then the government began granting the royal allotment on an 
annual basis as part of the national budget 
the civil list as the payment is known will rise at about 75 
percent per year for the next decade mrs thatcher said 
she said the royal family is a focus of patriotism loyalty 
affection and esteem it is a rare combination and we should value 
it 
behind her move was the wish to avoid the annual budgetday 
pay rise announcement which both politicians and the royal 
family found unseemly antimonarchists used the budget 
announcement as a chance to attack the expense of maintaining the 
royals 
under the 1990 budget the royal allowance totalled about 121 
million queen elizabeth ii received the lions share at 926 
million 
the civil list officially repays the monarch and 10 other 
members of her family for official duties about 70 percent of the 
money goes to salaries and employment costs for royal staff 
the queen has 250 permanent fulltime employees including those 
in her private office the buckingham palace press office staff and 
those responsible for ceremonial duties 
prince charles the heir to the throne is not on the civil 
list he receives undisclosed income from royal estates 
opposition labor party leader neil kinnock applauded the new 
arrangement and said it would provide for greater continuity and 
more effective planning in the financing of the royal household 
meanwhile the queen has recruited a leading london accountant 
to help run her households more efficiently 
michael peat 40 a partner in the accounting firm of peat 
marwick mclintock was named the royal households director of 
finance and property services he will oversee the management of 
buckingham palace windsor castle st james palace and kensington 
palace

the house judiciary committee approved on 
tuesday a sevenday waiting period for handgun purchases brushing 
aside opposition from the national rifle association 
rep edward f feighan dohio the bills sponsor hailed the 
committee approval on a 279 vote as a great victory in the war 
against crime 
the measures sponsors say it is designed to give police time to 
check the backgrounds of wouldbe purchasers it is known as the 
brady bill in honor of former white house press secretary jim 
brady who was shot in the 1981 attack on thenpresident reagan and 
has lobbied in favor of it 
in the senate a similar bill has been introduced by sen howard 
m metzenbaum dohio 
the house judiciary committee on monday approved an omnibus 
crime bill that would increase from five to 10 years in prison the 
maximum penalty for use of a sawedoff shotgun or rifle in a drug 
crime and establish a 30year sentence for using a bomb or hand 
grenade 
earlier the committee approved legislation to curb 
semiautomatic assault weapons it would ban an estimated 12 guns 
made in the united states 
the senatepassed version of omnibus crime legislation would ban 
the import or domestic manufacture of nine semiautomatic assault 
weapons 
it was unclear when the house would have a floor vote on the 
waitingperiod bill although supporters were hoping for one before 
lawmakers leave washington on their august recess 
before approving its handgun bill the house committee defeated 
on a 2412 vote a substitute proposed by rep bill mccollum rfla 
it would have required states to upgrade their law enforcement 
computer systems to allow for pointofpurchase telephone 
identification of felons attempting to buy guns 
it also would have required states to put fingerprints on 
drivers licenses within five years or risk losing federal funds 
mccollum argues that the measure would work too much of a 
hardship on honest gun purchasers and that his plan would strike 
more directly at criminals

fax machines were whirring and researchers 
were combing legal opinions tuesday as interest groups in the 
nations capital began mobilizing to uncover information about 
david h souter president bushs choice for a supreme court seat 
conservative and liberal activists alike were taking a 
waitandsee attitude 
they acknowledged the president caught them a little off guard 
by moving so swiftly to choose a successor to william j brennan 
who announced his surprise retirement from the court just three 
days before souter was named monday to succeed him 
activists on both sides agreed the senate confirmation process 
for souter would be searching but nothing like the battle royal 
that engulfed and ultimately defeated robert bork when former 
president ronald reagan picked him for a 1987 court vacancy 
souter is clearly not like bork said elliot mincberg of 
people for the american way he doesnt have much of a track 
record 
mincbergs liberal organization took a leading role three years 
ago in lobbying against bork who had written extensive attacks on 
liberal high court rulings and activist judges 
but mincberg said so far there are no similar plans this time 
we just dont know enough about him souter to make a 
judgment he said but we hope the senators will provide a 
searching inquiry 
benjamin hooks executive director of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people said his organization is 
withholding judgment but he expressed concern that brennans 
departure comes at a time when the court is turning more and more 
to a narrow and restrictive view of the constitution to the 
detriment of minorities women the poor and the powerless 
souter a 50yearold bachelor served seven years on the new 
hampshire supreme court before bush appointed him to the 
bostonbased 1st us circuit court of appeals this year 
his record reveals little about his views on abortion and other 
divisive social issues he is sure to confront if confirmed by the 
senate 
conservative activist pat mcguigan said his fax machine was 
overheating as it spews out reams of material on souters 
opinions as a state judge 
it looks on first impression like hes a good nominee 
mcguigan said adding nobody knows anything about him 
he said in terms of senate confirmation this is very 
helpful 
the united conservatives of america gave the nomination a 
cautious thumbsup with richard a viguerie chairman of the 
group saying most conservatives today have nervous smiles 
we think we can be happy but were a little apprehensive we 
dont know a lot about judge souter he said 
but there was no approval cautious or otherwise from peter 
flaherty chairman of the conservative campaign fund and former 
chairman of citizens for reagan 
there remain too many unanswered questions about who he is and 
how this nomination came about flaherty said i do know one 
thing president bush needlessly passed over a number of highly 
qualified candidates for the court whose philosophy is wellknown 
in doing so he has taken an unacceptable risk 
souters nomination was compared by some to those of sandra day 
oconnor and anthony m kennedy two of reagans appointees to the 
high court both underwent a fair amount of scrutiny in the senate 
and both were confirmed rather easily to become conservative 
justices 
brennan is the first liberal justice to leave the court since 
william o douglas retired in 1975 
kennedy replaced justice lewis f powell a swing vote on the 
closely divided court bork was reagans first choice for the seat 
douglas ginsburg reagans second choice withdrew after admitting 
he had smoked marijuana 
some activists said that by picking souter bush achieved at 
least two shortterm political gains he shortcircuited efforts by 
opposing sides lobbying for someone with a clear stand on abortion 
they said and he selected someone noncontroversial with excellent 
prospects of winning senate approval 
phil gutis of the american civil liberties union said his 
organization normally does not take a position on supreme court 
nominees as it did in the case of bork 
we opposed bork because it was such an extreme case he said

the apollo astronauts and soyuz 
cosmonauts who met in space 15 years ago this month said tuesday 
greater space cooperation could save both of their countries time 
and money 
we have now very good orbital complex cosmonaut alexei 
leonov said referring to the soviet space station mir but we 
dont have good transport system we use only soyuz spacecraft it 
is not enough 
leonov suggested that the soviets use us shuttles and 
americans in turn have access to mir which was launched in 1986 
im sure we could use mir right now said astronaut vance 
brand commander of the shuttle columbias delayed astronomy 
mission 
both columbia and atlantis have been disabled by hydrogen leaks 
leonov brand and the other three men who made history on july 
17 1975 when apollo and soyuz docked 140 miles above earth said 
during a news conference at johnson space center in houston that 
their mission set the stage for ussoviet space relations 
to us it was a symbol that here were countries with two 
absolutely different languages two different units of measurement 
and two political philosophies yet we set forth a common goal 
said thomas stafford who commanded the apollo mission 
leonov and cosmonaut valery kubasov have been on an apollosoyuz 
reunion tour of the united states the past two weeks with stafford 
and former astronaut donald deke slayton the four plan to 
visit marshall space flight center in huntsville ala on 
wednesday and floridas kennedy space center on thursday 
brand has been unable to take part in the reunion activities 
except for tuesdays program because of his preparations for the 
columbia mission 
stafford a retired air force lieutenant general said he would 
like to see a repeat of the apollosoyuz mission as well as a 
cosmonaut on a shuttle and an astronaut on mir during the next 
decade 
he stressed the importance of soviet input in americas plans 
for missions to the moon and mars 
sometimes it is very healthy to compete and some other times 
it is important and necessary to work together said kubasov 
an important and complicated technological mission such as a 
flight to mars is certainly one of those which would necessitate 
cooperation

the romanian senate voted tuesday to 
restore dec 1 as romanias national day as it was before 
communist rule 
the previous national day was aug 23 commemorating the date in 
1944 when romania broke its alliance with the axis and sided with 
the allies in world war ii the alliance with the soviet union 
paved the way for 45 years of communist domination of this country 
dec 1 marks the 1918 union of transylvania with the other 
provinces comprising presentday romania wallachia and moldavia 
the proposal must also pass a vote in the house of deputies 
which is scheduled to debate the issue wednesday the senate vote 
was seen however as ensuring its final passage 
the choice of a date not directly related to last decembers 
revolution that toppled the communist dictatorship reflects popular 
disagreement over which date is most important dec 1617 when 
riots in the western city of timisoara began the uprising or the 
overthrow of nicolae ceausescu on dec 22 
neither possible date can give people the right to cancel 
dec 1 said sen dan iosif of the ruling national salvation 
front communists alone dared to cancel it lets hope no one is 
ever so bold as to do it again 
but laura anton 23 reflected the opinion of some more 
concerned with recent events than the countrys history i do not 
think it is fair that the national day be dec 1 since it means 
nothing to us she insisted it should be either dec 22 or at 
least dec 17

animal rights activists are gathering 
on chincoteague island this week to protest what they call the 
mistreatment of the islands famed wild ponies during the annual 
pony swim 
every year for 65 years the volunteer firemen of chincoteague 
have rounded up the wild ponies on the neighboring coastal barrier 
island of assateague and auctioned off some of the foals to control 
the size of the herd 
on wednesday the ponies will be driven across the narrow inlet 
that separates the islands and herded through the towns streets to 
a penning area this years auction will be thursday with the 
proceeds going to the volunteer fire department 
last year the department sold 77 foals for 40000 some of the 
foals purchased are returned to the island at the request of the 
buyers 
the weeklong celebration brings about 30000 people to the tiny 
community 
the animals are thought to be the descendants of ponies that 
washed ashore from shipwrecks during colonial times they gained 
fame from marguerite henrys childrens classic misty of 
chincoteague first published in 1947 
animal rights groups such as the charlottesvillebased voices 
for animals and people for the ethical treatment of animals in 
washington dc say the round up penning and auction are cruel 
especially to the young animals 
the ponies must swim unfamiliar waters after which they are 
stampeded through town separated from their mothers and sold at 
auction said susan weidman of voices for animals 
its obvious that the fire company does not have the best 
interest of the horses at heart she said 
peta is upset that unweaned foals are auctioned off such 
animals need special care if they are to survive away from their 
mother said peta spokeswoman siriol evans 
none of the groups said they planned to actively protest the 
pony swim or auction this year but will observe the events and 
help the animals if necessary 
the humane society of the united states has been monitoring the 
event for 20 years 
gail eisnitz a field investigator for the humane society in 
washington said conditions for the animals have improved although 
six animals have died in the last two years 
one year horses ate toxic chokecherry leaves off bushes 
overhanging the pen became sick and died 
as a result of those deaths the chincoteague national wildlife 
refuge on assateague threatened to revoke the fire departments 
permit to graze the animals on the refuge if the department did not 
provide a veterinarian for the swim penning and auction 
last year the department had veterinarians on call but two 
horses still died 
this year terry said the fire department has hired a 
veterinarian to stay on the site full time 
ms eisnitz said the national fish and wildlife service has 
demanded other improvements in exchange for the grazing rights 
the fire department has enlarged the corral provided a shaded 
area and more water for the animals they have also cut back the 
chokecherry bushes she said 
the fire department works year round to help the herd which 
numbers around 200 the animals are regularly checked by a 
veterinarian

the family of a young woman killed by her 
romantic rival has filed a lawsuit to keep the convicted murderer 
from profiting from the crime by selling her story to authors or 
movie producers 
the parents of lisa cihaski filed a wrongful death lawsuit 
against lori esker 21 seeking an undisclosed amount of money 
including compensation for their daughters funeral and burial 
there is no way that she should be able to profit from this 
she wont if we have anything to say about it said richard 
weber the lawyer for vilas and shirley cihaski 
ms esker a former county dairy princess has had offers from 
movie producers to sell her story but wont pursue them her lawyer 
said monday 
she was convicted june 14 of firstdegree intentional homicide 
in the sept 20 strangulation of ms cihaski 21 she faces a 
mandatory life prison term when she is sentenced july 31 
testimony during the trial portrayed ms esker as an obsessively 
jealous woman who believed ms cihaski had stolen her boyfriend and 
intentionally killed her to eliminate the competition in a love 
triangle 
ms esker was the reigning marathon county dairy princess an 
award based on talent and leadership in agriculture when she 
killed ms cihaski 
weber likened the case to the highly publicized son of sam 
killings in new york in the late 1970s in which the killer david 
berkowitz made money from his story the state of new york 
subsequently passed a law banning such profiteering weber said 
maybe something like this will cause the legislature to think 
about it and pass some sort of legislation to protect victims of 
crimes and their families weber said 
one of ms eskers lawyers dean strang of milwaukee said 
producers for bigscreen movies and madefortelevision movies have 
sent feelers to her asking about buying the rights to her story 
both lori and her family from the very start have made it 
crystal clear that they do not intend to profit from this tragedy 
in any way strang said 
the civil suit against ms esker was filed last week in marathon 
county circuit court

david souter drives cars until they rust he 
was an altar boy in his hometown clapboard episcopal church he has 
a sharp yankee sense of humor capable of piercing stuffed shirts 
he climbs mountains 
he lives alone on the family farm a monastic life says 
sen warren rudman a friend he is sober cautious solidly 
conservative erudite when the white house telephoned sunday 
night souter was home researching the law books 
dissecting the life and thoughts of this 50yearold new england 
bachelor became an overnight industry in washington after president 
bush picked him to take the supreme court seat of liberal justice 
william j brennan a dominant figure even in dissent 
at law firms on capitol hill at the pro and antiabortion 
lobbies over a thousand lunch tables on the longdistance phone 
to anyone in new hampshire who might know him souter was topic a 
on tuesday 
the nominee offered a thin paper trail his resume lists only 
one article a tribute to a new hampshire judge he has written no 
opinions in the scant time since bush put him on the bostonbased 
1st circuit court of appeals 
still a verdict was taking shape 
central to the right rather than central to the left 
offered stanley w brown a prominent manchester nh lawyer 
but you arent going to pick it up in any of his writings 
added brown you probably wont in the future he will follow the 
case where the case takes him 
retired new hampshire lawyer gordon tiffany said souter is 
capable of shedding political biases when deciding a case 
i believe whether its liberal or conservative its not the 
issue in his mind tiffany said the issue in his mind is what 
was intended in the constitution that this democracy should live up 
to and those are the ideas he believes in 
lawyers call that principle stare decisis respect for 
judicial precedent one government official who is familiar with 
souters background but is unwilling to be quoted by name said 
souter goes by the values and philosophy of the great 
dissenter conservative court giant oliver wendell holmes 
another stickler for precedent 
the official said he took that to mean that souter would be 
reluctant to overturn a previous decision such as roe vs wade 
which legalized abortion in 1973 
souter it rhymes with scooter steeped himself in classical 
law and literature he continues a program of reading books that 
holmes read 
acquaintances remark on souters humorous side one calls him a 
raconteur 
he has a wicked sense of humor that can skewer the most 
stuffed shirt said close friend tom rath who succeeded souter 
as state attorney general another friend lawyer john barto says 
he has a twinkle in his eye 
his is the kind of humor that helps to make a person 
balanced said tiffany 
souter served as president of the board of concord hospital at 
a retirement party recalled hospital president dr richard warner 
he displayed the most fantastic dry sense of humor that you can 
imagine 
for all that souter was a notorious hard worker said warner 
i never worked so hard in my life than when he was here the 
doctor said his method of leadership is to kind of be behind the 
scenes and make things happen 
added another friend and sponsor sen rudman rnh if 
he has any faults i believe its that hes worked too hard all his 
life but thats the way he is 
even in his 1957 yearbook at concord high school soutie was 
described as studious and hardworking but also witty and in 
constant demand classmates called him most literary most 
sophisticated and most likely to succeed 
a yearbook sketch shows the young souters face imposed on a 
drawing of a caveman dragging a classmate marjorie macleod by 
the hair 
his yearbook photograph shows a grinning young man with a crew 
cut and bushy eyebrows he is wearing a conservative brown suit he 
was an altar boy at the centuryold holy cross episcopal church in 
weare nh 
now he worships at the st andrews episcopal church in 
hopkinton nh a member of the congregation kathy pepin said he 
always helps a woman in a wheelchair 
every single sunday he wheels her out of the church and brings 
her to her car always joking and laughing with her at the same 
time she said 
friends say souter has a parsimonious nature despite a net 
worth of over 600000 he drove cars until they were rusty with 
age 
when he goes mountain climbing with his law clerks said lawyer 
jack middleton they come back dragging their tongues 
he lives alone at the souter family farmhouse in weare nh he 
shared the house with his widowed mother helen until she moved 
into a retirement home 
mrs souter 82 said she shed a tear when he called from 
washington monday with the news she said shell miss his weekly 
visits 
isnt that silly but being a mother id miss him if he went 
to boston said mrs souter

the senate will vote wednesday on a resolution 
denouncing sen dave durenberger for financial misconduct only 
durenberger and perhaps fellow minnesota republican rudy 
boschwitz are expected not to vote for the resolution 
durenbergers press secretary lois west said the senator would 
vote present boschwitzs press secretary tim droogsma said 
his boss may vote the same way 
west said durenberger had ruled out a challenge to the 
resolution which she said the rest of durenbergers colleagues are 
expected to approve 
there have been senators who said they would support him in 
whatever he wanted them to do west said durenberger if 
asked has been saying that he would just as soon they accept it 
as he has done 
the senate ethics committee recommended last week that the full 
chamber denounce durenberger for unequivocally unethical 
conduct in connection with a bookpromotion scheme and senate 
payments on his minneapolis condominium 
durenberger will be required to make up to 123000 in 
restitution to the senate 
he had appealed to the committee for a lighter penalty saying 
denouncement was much too onerous 
once the decision was made he said he wasnt going to 
challenge it it was appropriate to argue the penalty in 
advance west said 
boschwitz was considering voting against the resolution until he 
talked to durenberger and learned he would not challenge the 
sanction droogsma said 
boschwitz believes durenberger has already been punished by the 
length of the 22monthold ethics investigation and the 500000 in 
legal fees he has incurred droogsma said

about 1400 viewers of cable news networks 
newsnight dialed a 900 number to select two stories to be aired 
on the earlymorning news show tuesday 
the winners of the viewer poll stories on the controversial 
antidepression drug prozac and an alabama marijuana eradication 
program 
this was the shakedown cruise executive producer joshua 
loory said after the show which was the networks first attempt at 
interactive television i think there were some minor production 
problems but all in all it went pretty well im tickled right 
now 
near the beginning of the hourlong show which starts at 
midnight viewers were presented with a menu of six stories and the 
900 number which costs 75 cents to call the calls were tabulated 
by computer and the two most popular stories were fit into the 
regular newscast one in the top halfhour the other in the second 
halfhour 
besides the two winners viewers had a choice of stories on the 
latest testimony in washington mayor marion barrys drug trial a 
sailing program designed to keep native american teens off drugs 
summer jobs and efforts to save the spotted owl 
the story on prozac received 35 percent of the vote while the 
drug eradication program received 26 percent the stories on the 
sailing program summer jobs and the spotted owl got few votes he 
said 
loory said the shows producers are content to leave viewer 
selection at two stories 
were still very much in control of whats going into the 
show he said 
although the network has no current plans to use the poll as a 
longterm guide itll probably be pretty interesting to look at 
the choices down the road and see what the viewers are selecting 
loory said

here are excerpts from some of the new 
hampshire supreme court opinions by david h souter president 
bushs choice for the supreme court 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in a 1988 ruling souter said a state law was unconstitutional 
when applied to bar the new hampshire disabilities rights center 
authorized by state law to provide legal services to the poor from 
representing some disabled clients who were not poor 
the drcs request runs counter to the applicable state 
statutes souter said despite this conflict we hold that 
enforcement of state law to prohibit the drc as a nonprofit 
corporation from representing nonindigent clients in its advocacy 
in behalf of disabled people would violate the first and 14th 
amendments of the national constitution 
organizations their members and their staff lawyers may 
assert a protected first amendment right of association for 
noncommercial purposes to advocate the enforcement of legal and 
constitutional rights of those members or of others within a 
definite class whom the organization exists to serve 
when such advocacy may reasonably include the provision of 
legal advice or take the form of litigation the organization may 
itself provide legal representation to its members or beneficiaries 
despite state regulations restricting legal practice and the 
solicitation of clients 
in a 1988 decision souter ordered a new trial for a man who 
had been convicted of sexual assault he said the mans lawyer 
wrongly was blocked from offering evidence of the alleged victims 
public behavior with other men a vital aspect of the defendants 
claim that she had consented 
during the noon hour of june 28 1985 the defendant richard 
colbath went with some companions to the smokey lantern tavern in 
farmington where he became acquainted with the female complainant 
there was evidence that she directed sexually provocative attention 
toward several men in the bar with whom she associated during the 
ensuing afternoon the defendant among them 
the two of them eventually left the tavern and went to the 
defenants trailer it is undisputed that sexual intercourse 
followed forcibly according to the complainant consensual 
according to the defendant in any case before they left the 
trailer the two of them were joined unexpectedly by a young woman 
who lived with the defendant who came home at an unusual hour 
suspecting that the defendant was indulging in faithless behavior 
with her suspicion confirmed she became enraged kicked the 
trailer door open and went for the complainant whom she assaulted 
violently and dragged outside by the hair it took the intervention 
of the defendant and a third woman to bring the melee to an end 
in another sexual assault case souter wrote for the court in 
1987 
during final argument in the defendants trial on two counts 
of aggravated felonious assault and one of kidnapping the 
prosecutor commented on defense counsels failure to elicit any 
testimony indicating the victim was promiscuous the defense 
objected on the ground that the state rape shield law would have 
precluded admission of any such evidence and objected further to 
the trial judges refusal to give any curative instruction 
the comment can reasonably be interpreted as nothing more than 
a response to defense counsels attempts in crossexamination and 
closing arguments to present the victim as a woman of small virtue 
seeking a stranger for sexual amusement 
this intimation was the whole point of defense counsels 
fishing for testimony that the victim and her friends went to the 
club to drink mingle with the crowd and dance with men they did 
not know even though the fishing did not net much defense counsel 
stuck to the point in a closing argument that held the victim up as 
someone who drank at the club walked through the crowd maybe 
danced and invited male pursuit by her solitary departure 
in a word the defense tried to paint the victim as 
promiscuous and there was nothing wrong with the prosecutions 
plain contention that the try had failed 
in a 1988 decision souter upheld a robbery conviction over 
arguments that the defendant had been arrested unlawfully 
on otherwise deserted streets and within minutes of a late 
evening robbery in a small town the police officer saw an 
individual who matched the victims description of the perpetrator 
as a male with bushy hair while the rain might have induced his 
rapid gait it did nothing to explain away his highly suspicious 
behavior in taking no ostensible notice of a bright spotlight 
suddenly shining upon him 
reasonable caution and prudence were satisfied in deciding 
that the man on the street had probably committed the robbery 
in 1989 souter said a bank could not be held contractually 
liable for failing to discover poor workmanship on a construction 
project for which it had given loans to ross and virginia seymour 
the seymours make a further try at salvaging the contract 
claim by asserting that bank officers orally agreed to shift the 
seymours responsibility to the bank pointing to a loan officers 
alleged remark that the banks inspections would be a safeguard 
and well worth it they conveniently forget however that they 
never asked the trial court for a specific finding that the remark 
was made 
a 1986 decision went against a childabuse defendant who had 
sought to question the alleged victim at a pretrial proceeding the 
defendant had wanted to secure a sworn statement called a 
deposition 
at the most basic level these state and federal cases reflect 
the fact that courtordered discovery does not exhaust the 
practical possibilities for investigating and preparing a criminal 
case this defendant had access for example to a statement by the 
victim that not only anticipates the victims trial testimony but 
provides a basis to attack the reliability of the testimony if the 
victim offers it 
given such sources of information and evidence we simply 
cannot say that discovery depositions are necessarily essential to 
adequate trial preparation 
the state court in 1986 ruled that doctors have a 
responsibility to test for birth defects and inform pregnant women 
of possible defects to given them the option of abortion in a 
concurring opinion souter addressed an additional issue 
the questions transferred to us fail to raise a 
significant issue in the area of malpractice litigation that we 
address today the trial court did not ask whether or how a 
physician with conscientious scruples against abortion and the 
testing and counseling that may inform an abortion decision can 
discharge his professional obligation without engaging in 
procedures that his religious or moral principles condemn 
i do not understand the court to hold that a physician can 
discharge the obligation of due care in such circumstances only by 
personally ordering such tests and rendering such advice the court 
does not hold that some or all physicians must make a choice 
between rendering services that they morally condemn and leaving 
their profession in order to escape malpractice exposure

us officials charged tuesday that rebels in 
ethiopia have intentionally blocked shipments of desperately needed 
food from reaching thousands of hungry people in the country 
they have basically betrayed their people they have lied 
they are using food as a weapon rep tony hall dohio said 
of the eritrean peoples liberation front a rebel organization 
that controls portions of northern ethiopia hall is chairman of 
the house select committee on hunger 
the anger of hall and andrew natsios of the us office of 
foreign disaster assistance was triggered by the rebel groups 
refusal to allow a danish freighter flying the united nations flag 
to enter the red sea port of massawa the rebels captured massawa 
earlier this year 
for 10 days the ship the nordland saga waited in vain for 
permission to enter massawa natsios said finally the ship left 
the region tuesday because the rebels continued to stall 
natsios said excuses offered by the rebels for failure to admit 
the ship were ludicrous 
natsios and hall spokes in interviews after meeting to discuss 
the food situation in northern ethiopia 
the ship contained a fourman technical team who intended to 
survey the channels and docks at massawa to make sure they could 
accommodate vessels carrying 25000 tons of food those ships have 
been diverted elsewhere 
hall said the rebels have reneged on an earlier promise to let 
the ship land in an interview on abctvs nightline show on 
april 4 tesfai ghermazien a spokesman for the liberation front 
said the rebels would open up the port 
if food cannot get into ethiopia through massawa famine could 
worsen rapidly in the next few weeks natsios said 
until now food has gone into the country by land from the 
south but the rainy season which began this week will soon make 
roads impassable to trucks he said 
in april the ethiopian government estimated that 44 million 
people were threatened with starvation and said its total emergency 
food needs would total more than 900000 tons this year

president bush interviewed edith h jones a 
federal appellate judge from houston as well as appeals court 
judge david h souter before choosing souter for the supreme court

41 and souter 50 were interviewed by bush said the sources who

a member of the us circuit court of appeals in washington and 
solicitor general kenneth w starr 44 the sources said 
silberman voted in the 21 majority last friday as the

marla maples still hoping for a fairytale 
ending with donald trump is fighting a subpoena to testify about 
his prenuptial agreement with ivana trump a publicist for the 
actress said tuesday 
chuck jones commented on a daily news report that mrs trumps 
lawyer michael kennedy had obtained testimony from bodyguards and 
other trump organization employees for an aug 20 hearing on the 
prenuptial agreement 
the testimony proves not only that trump was having an affair 
with marla but that he funneled money through chuck jones to pay 
for her credit cards and that he comped didnt bill her for 
anything and everything she wanted at his hotels kennedy was 
quoted as saying 
in the hotel business everybody comps trump told the news 
so what i took a gift tax on everything and now that marlas 
earning money shes paying me back 
jones said he could not comment directly on kennedys assertions 
because he and maples have been subpoenaed to give depositions for 
the prenuptial agreement hearing 
but he said he would fight the subpoena because his opinion is 
irrelevant to the premarital agreement he said maples also is 
fighting the deposition subpoena 
kennedy said he was misquoted in the news although he wouldnt 
specify how he had no response to joness comments said his 
assistant gregory lenihan 
the news meanwhile said maples still dreams of a future with 
the mogul 
of course i would think about it of course she said when 
asked if shed consider marrying the donald this could be a 
story with a very beautiful ending 
didnt king edward once fall in love with a married woman and 
leave his throne jones said tuesday edward abdicated to marry 
wallis simpson a divorced american commoner 
its life jones said she maples cant be faulted for 
any of that 
she had nothing to do with the marital problems of donald and 
ivana trump and doesnt want the public to think that she did 
said jones she just feels the timing is right to take a stand 
maples who has been romantically linked to the new york 
developer for eight months described ivana trump as a cold 
woman who is neglecting her children 
she said mrs trump is out every night in london and new york 
going on dates to her society parties while donald is home raising 
the children 
i see my children every single day mrs trump told the news 
through her spokeswoman lisa calandra donald sees them once a 
week at most and has gone weeks on end without seeing them at all 
beyond that i wont dignify anything marla maples has to say 
she sounds just like donald mrs trump was quoted as saying

the millionaire campaigning to lower 
americans cholesterol levels to reduce the risk of heart attacks 
said tuesday his fight against fastfood fat isnt finished despite 
a victory on the frenchfry front 
phil sokolof president and chief financial backer of the 
national heart savers association said he was pleased that 
mcdonalds corp and wendys joined burger king and several other 
fastfood chains in switching to allvegetable oils for cooking 
french fries 
mcdonalds officials said the companys announcement monday to 
switch to cottonseed and corn oil had nothing to do with sokolofs 
antifat campaign against the fastfood restaurants 
but sokolof said his ads criticizing mcdonalds and other 
restaurants for cooking foods in beef tallow or a vegetablebeef 
combination oil rather than using what he called hearthealthy oils 
speeded up the process 
sokolof who claims to have spent more than 25 million in the 
ad campaigns said the fat issue has been forced in front of food 
company executives by the public not by him 
the american public as consumers have the power to move 
mountains he said mcdonalds is a mountain 
wendys international spokesman denny lynch said from columbus 
ohio tuesday that converting to corn oil will cost more but he 
wouldnt say how much 
it would be safe to say that each chain will spend millions 
more each year he said 
he said equipment will not need to be changed but there will be 
changes in training employees such as how often the oil should be 
changed and cooking time 
mcdonalds spokeswoman terry capatosto said the company will use 
the same supplier to buy the new french fry oil 
cost wasnt a factor at all she said of the switch the 
biggest consideration was making sure the company didnt change the 
taste she said 
both companies said they worked for months to develop an oil 
that would fry potatoes with the same taste as before 
sokolof 67 formed the private foundation national heart savers 
association after he suffered a heart attack 
the foundations targets have been snacks made with tropical 
oils and fastfood restaurants though he acknowledges americans 
would have to lower the amount of meat and dairy products they 
consume to lower cholesterol levels 
americans will continue to eat meat and dairy products and 
continue to go to fastfood restaurants he said 
fastfood restaurants are not diet emporiums people are still 
going to eat there he said now they can make healthier 
choices 
the beef tallow industry will be hurt by the allvegetable oil 
decision said rich parker of the american meat institute but he 
said he did not know how much of an effect there would be 
us department of commerce figures showed that 12 billion 
pounds of beef tallow was produced in the united states last year 
but parker said he did not know how much of that went into cooking 
oil or shortening 
beef tallow also is used in paint as a lubricant in some 
plastics and some cosmetics said roger mandigo an animal science 
professor at the university of nebraskalincoln 
sokolof said he would continue to run ads for as long as it 
takes to improve the public perception of cholesterol levels 
though he said he is pleased with the tremendous results from 
the ads so far 
he took out a fullpage ad in tuesdays washington post urging 
congress to pass a foodlabeling bill requiring nutritional 
information on food labels and establishing definitions for terms 
such as lite and high in fiber

corporate americas interest in national 
health care reform improves the odds such legislation will ever go 
anywhere according to union leaders who announced a new health 
care campaign on tuesday 
the business communitys support for changing the nations 
health care system should help persuade the bush administration 
that federal legislation is needed said four union presidents who 
announced a fall campaign to build public support for a health care 
law 
if the administration view is going to be changed its going 
to be changed by corporate america and not the aflcio said 
morton bahr president of the communications workers of america 
the new jobs for justice health care campaign will attempt 
to rally the aflcios 142 million members into action on the 
issue bahr and other union leaders said 
on oct 3 the unions hope to have millions of american workers 
sporting lapel pins calling for health care reform 
also that day they will man information booths at work sites 
around the country and picket nonunion businesses that dont 
provide their workers with health insurance benefits 
through our public demonstrations and displays of workplace 
solidarity well be asking other workers and our communities to 
join the aflcios grassroots health care campaign said john 
sweeney president of the service employees international union and 
chairman of an aflcios panel studying health care issues 
union leaders said the health care problem is too large to be 
solved through labormanagment negotiations there are 37 million 
americans who have no insurance at all and another 50 million who 
have inadequate health care they said 
in addition the problem has increasingly become the no 1 
dispute between workers and management as costs increase and 
employers try to make workers pick up a larger share of the expense 
we cant accomplish this over the bargaining table it has 
to be through legislation said william bywater president of the 
international union of electronic electrical salaried machine 
and furniture workers 
karen brigham the us chamber of commerces health care 
expert said the business community no longer wants to maintain 
the status quo because health care costs have been speeding 
upward by 20 percent a year for employers 
neither the business community nor labor leaders have agreed on 
a specific proposal or how to pay for it 
workers have also been forced to take the matter more seriously 
bahr said 
weve seen a rash of strikes at the collective bargaining 
table where workers have put their jobs on the line and said 
clearly this is an issue we will fight over bahr said

a house panel urged a special prosecutor 
tuesday to widen the investigation of former hud secretary samuel 
pierce saying it had evidence pierce steered lucrative federal 
grants to his former law firm 
in its most detailed finding congressional investigators 
questioned whether pierces former law firm a former top aide and 
pierce himself may have violated federal bribery conspiracy and 
conflictofinterest laws during his tenure as secretary of housing 
and urban development 
the panel said evidence also suggested pierce who served 
throughout the eightyear reagan administration may have committed 
perjury at a panel hearing when he denied involvement in the 
awarding of key grants 
it is obvious that secretary pierce did not give us the full 
story the panel wrote however some of his statements stand 
out in that they are inconsistent and at odds with the sworn 
testimony of other witnesses 
pierce testified in the early stages of the probe then invoked 
his 5th amendment right against selfincrimination in refusing 
later questioning 
urging independent counsel arlin adams to substantially expand 
his investigation the house government operations subcommittee 
said its 14month investigation uncovered widespread abuses 
influence peddling blatant favoritism monumental waste and gross 
mismanagement at hud during pierces tenure 
its findings were offered in a letter signed by all eight 
subcommittee members three republicans and five democrats 
including chairman tom lantos dcalif 
pierces lawyer paul perito said there was nothing new 
different or worthy of attention in the letter he also said it 
was improper and inappropriate for the committee to direct a 
letter to the prosecutor rather than the justice department 
it appears primarily to be a rehash of stale allegations or 
the stacking of faulty conclusions based upon surmise innuendo or 
conjecture and not on hard evidence or testimony perito said 
hopefully this is the last spasm of life from this subcommittee 
trying in vain to justify their continuing existence 
the letter asked adams to expand his probe to perjury pierces 
dealings with the law firm and aide lance wilson and his role in 
huds coinsurance program in which the federal government shared 
responsibility for backing large housing development projects 
congressional investigators said there was previously 
undisclosed evidence gathered by the panels staff involving 
pierces dealings while secretary with the new york law firm 
battle fowler jaffin and kheel 
pierce was a partner before joining the reagan administration 
and had intended to return to legal practice there the letter said 
documents found in hud files the panel said show that the firm 
frequently sought pierces assistance in hudrelated matters it 
said they included having pierce meet with their client to discuss 
a development grant application and helping secure lucrative 
housing subsidies 
it cited a 1985 letter from partner martin l edelman to pierce 
assistant deborah gore dean seeking her help in obtaining a subsidy 
for an amherst ny project under the section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program 
it also recounted er assistance in another project there 
allenhurst apartments the year before 
it defies logic and reason that ms dean would have assisted 
battle fowler in obtaining these scarce and muchindemand 
subsidy units for the allenhurst project on her own without the 
direct and intimate involvement of secretary pierce the letter 
said adding that it appears ms dean helped the firm at the behest 
of pierce 
the law firm denied any wrongdoing 
we are confident that no member or employeeof the firm has 
engaged in any inappropriate conduct said thomas glynn a 
partner and spokesman for battle fowler 
the panel also said it had evidence that wilson who later 
became a housing specialist with the investment company paine 
webber and pierce engaged in activities aimed at benefiting each 
other 
it cited 1988 telephone messages in which wilson while working 
for paine webber called pierce to tell him of the status of 
pending financial deals and of the role his former law firm had 
played in the deals 
this suggests that lance wilson with the secretarys 
knowledge and approval acted to steer hudrelated legal work to 
the law firm in which secretary pierce had been a partner in the 
past and was likely to become a partner again in the future the 
letter said 
in suggesting pierce may have committed perjury the panel cited 
pierces denial that he directed ms dean or anyone else to approve 
particular grants 
that was contrasted with public testimony by former hud 
officials who said pierce did direct funding on specific projects 
former assistant dubois gilliam testified that hud dealt strictly 
in politics 
ms dean refused to testify citing constitutional rights 
against selfincrimination

david h souter in a hearing on his 
nomination to a federal appellate judgeship earlier this year 
defended overturning a sexual assault conviction on grounds that 
the defendants right to interrogate his accuser overrode the 
womans right of privacy 
but souter also assured sen edward m kennedy that he respected 
the need for shield laws discouraging defense attorneys from 
prying into the sexual lives of sexual assault victims yes 
souter replied when asked if he would be sensitive to this problem 
nevertheless he said the new hampshire case in question was 
one in which the rape shield law had to yield he said the 
victims right to privacy was effectively overridden by trial 
testimony that she had made sexually provocative statements to 
several men in a bar in the hours before the alleged assault 
sensitivity to that particular privacy dilemma is something 
which is enormously important in terms of the balance of 
interests kennedy told souter during the senate judiciary 
committee hearing april 5 the committee released a transcript of 
the hearing tuesday 
the 50yearold souter selected by president bush to succeed 
william j brennan on the supreme court was explaining his 
thinking as a member of the new hampshire supreme court his 
opinion on behalf of a unanimous court was subsequently 
criticized by people for the american way a washingtonbased 
liberaloriented lobbying organization 
the decision reversed the trial court conviction of a man 
accused of aggravated rape on the ground that the lower court had 
refused to admit evidence about the victims public behavior with 
men in the hours before the alleged assault 
the lower court had instructed the jury that the victims 
conduct with other individuals was not relevant to the question of 
whether she consented to sex with the defendant 
souter told the hearing that the question before the court was 
whether the womans privacy right under the states rape shield law 
must give way to the defendants constitutional right to 
crossexamine his accuser 
the complaining witness behavior immediately prior to their 
departure from the public bar in question had a very high degree of 
significance souter said so that was an example of a case 
which is not unfamiliar to us in which the rape shield law had to 
yield 
kennedy also questioned souter about a ruling in which he upheld 
the conviction of a man who under questioning by police before his 
arrest said if you think i am going to confess to you you are 
crazy 
the massachusetts democrat noted that the 1st us circuit court 
of appeals on which souter ultimately was seated threw out the 
conviction in a rather critical ruling that reversed souters 
the higher court said that souters ruling placed too much stock 
in the mans seemingly selfincriminating remark and gave 
shortshrift to the general theme of the remark in which the man 
was saying he wouldnt answer police questions at the time 
souters ruling the appellate court said ignores the 
teaching that the protection of the fifth amendment against 
selfincrimination is not limited to those in custody or charged 
with a crime 
the judge told the committee the nub of the disagreement is 
that the language which you kennedy quoted is language which we 
read to be essentially inculpatory and not a fifth amendment 
invocation 
kennedy asked what assurance can you give us that you will 
not take a crabbed view of the scope of that fundamental 
constitutional protection 
the judge replied 
well i think the assurance that the principle that you have 
just enunciated goes without saying or should go without saying 
in the mind of any judge including mine 
he was approved by voice vote in the committee and 
subsequently in the same fashion on the senate floor for the 
federal appellate judgeship

the bush administration opposes forgiving any 
of polands 41 billion debt but is reviewing the issue assistant 
secretary of state raymond g h seitz told congress tuesday 
seitz who is in charge of european affairs appeared before the 
subcommittee on europe of the house foreign affairs committee the 
subcommittee chairman rep lee h hamilton dind said in an 
interview afterwards that polands debt will have to be reduced 
sooner or later 
polands government has been asking repeatedly for some 
reduction foreign business is wary of investing in polish efforts 
to move away from a communist system because of the debt overhang 
at the hearing hamilton pressed seitz on the question rep jan 
meyers rkan another member of the panel also told him that 
poland needs debt relief 
seitz said the administration is aware of polands problems and 
pointed out that debt repayments have been put off according to 
the world bank poland owed an additional 71 billion in back 
interest in 1988 
youre opposed to forgiveness hamilton asked 
yes at the moment seitz replied 
treasury nicholas f brady devised a reduction plan last year 
for countries with big debts to banks but polands debts are owed 
largely to other governments and only about 9 billion is owed to 
banks 
west germany and france are major creditors about 3 billion is 
owed to the united states 
david e mulford bradys undersecretary for international 
affairs had warned that forgiving polands debt would set a 
precedent for others with big debts to governments 
president bush set a precedent himself last month by offering to 
forgive some debt of latin american countries which owe to 
governments as well as to banks earlier he had followed some 
european creditor countries and canada in offering to forgive a 
billion dollars worth of debts that the poorest countries in africa 
owe to the united states

forest service chief f dale robertson 
acknowledged before congress on tuesday that only about 10 percent 
of the northwests old trees remain standing and half of those 
are scheduled to be cut over the next 50 years 
however robertson disagreed with environmentalists who say the 
regions oldgrowth forests are being destroyed new trees are 
being replanted in their place he said 
the house interior national parks and public lands subcommittee 
is considering legislation to protect the regions forests without 
crippling its timber industry 
environmentalists have maintained for some time that only 10 
percent of the northwests original forests which they call 
ancient forests have survived harvests and natural disasters 
over the past 150 years 
however the timber industry has disputed those figures and in 
the past the forest service has declined to offer an estimate 
under questioning from lawmakers robertson acknowledged that 
approximately 10 percent of what he called old trees remain in 
the region 
i dont know if it is 10 or 9 or 12 percent but it is 
around that robertson said 
forest service spokesman jerry mason said later tuesday that 
old trees are those which are 200 years or older 
in other testimony assistant fish and wildlife service director 
ralph morgenweck said his agency opposes a proposal by oregon rep 
bob smith that would for the next five years exempt northwest 
timber sales from the protections granted the northern spotted owl 
under the endangered species act 
smith a republican attacked a recommendation by forest service 
biologist jack ward thomas and other government scientists that 
would protect the owl by banning logging across 3 million acres of 
northwest forests currently open to harvests 
meanwhile tuesday the house appropriations interior 
subcommittee approved a 20 percent reduction in pacific northwest 
timber harvests 
an area lawmaker said the deal which would set harvests on 
forest service lands in the northwest at 3 billion board feet is 
the least economically disruptive his region can expect this year

the navy should slow down its 44 billion 
seawolf attack submarine program because 15 of the costly vessels 
will be under contract before critical testing on the lead ship has 
been completed congressional investigators said tuesday 
the ssn21 program is using a concurrent scheduling approach 
which has construction ongoing while design is continuing martin 
ferber of the general accounting office told a house armed services 
subcommittee 
the subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical 
materials heard testimony from the gao and the navy on the 
submarine program the full committee begins crafting its version 
of the defense bill this week 
to meet the houseapproved military budget of 283 billion the 
seapower subcommittee must cut 3 billion from president bushs 
proposed request of 161 billion and the seawolf program may be 
a victim of the budget ax 
the navy plans to buy 29 of the ssn21 nuclear attack submarines 
by the year 2000 at a cost of 44 billion the first submarine 
designed by the newport news shipbuilding co of virginia and 
electric boat division of general dynamics in connecticut is 
estimated at 19 billion 
the navy expects the cost of subsequent submarines to decline 
averaging around 1 billion 
the submarines will be equipped with a sophisticated computer 
system that will allow the vessels to locate targets faster than 
existing submarines and cut the time between detecting the enemy 
and launching weapons 
the ssn21 will be quieter larger and deeper diving that the 
los angeles class of nuclear submarines the ssn688 
but the gao the investigative arm of congress said the 
submarine program and the onboard computer system are being 
developed separately with varying target dates for delivery to the 
navy 
under current plans the navy will have as many as 15 of the 29 
ships under contract before the lead ship undergoes operational 
tests the gao said in addition the computer system is a 
developmental risk ferber told the subcommittee 
the more mature you make the system the better off youre 
going to be ferber said in recommending a delay in the program 
but navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii argued that 
concurrency is something that cant be avoided 
in this declining business environment shipyards cannot build 
one ship wait for the navy to complete operational testing and 
still be in existence when we have proven the risk is behind us 
garrett said 
the senate armed services committee in approving a 289 billion 
defense bill earlier this month deferred purchasing two seawolf 
submarines at a cost of 23 billion because of excessive 
concurrency 
the panel instead substituted two of the ssn688 los 
angelesclass submarines at a cost of 18 billion

the number of serious disciplinary actions 
against physicians was the same in 1988 as during the previous 
year breaking a pattern of increasing rates a consumer group said 
tuesday 
the public citizen health research group said state medical 
boards took serious actions against 1489 physicians in 1988 the 
same number disciplined in 1987 
the actions included license revocation or suspension and 
physician probation the group said the group analyzed the most 
recent data compiled by the federation of state medical boards 
in 1984 serious actions were taken against 745 physicians 
public citizen said that increased to 1089 in 1985 and 1277 in 
1986 
however public said the 1988 disciplinary rates werent high 
enough 
a physician could still operate drunk commit a gross act of 
negligence or sexually assault a patient and receive a mere slap 
on the wrist from his or her states medical board in most 
states the group said 
the group however said it was encouraged that 44 state 
legislatures had passed legislation to strengthen state oversight 
of physicians 
public citizen released a report last month listing the names of 
6892 physicians who have been disciplined by state medical boards 
and the federal government the 1988 actions were not included in 
that report

the independent counsels office that 
prosecuted oliver north and john poindexter should be closed a 
republican member of the former house irancontra investigating 
panel said tuesday 
i believe we are well past the point where further pursuit of 
this matter by an independent counsel serves any public good 
rep william broomfield of michigan said in a letter to attorney 
general dick thornburgh 
but justice department sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said such a move would be politically difficult for 
thornburgh because it is believed walsh is looking into the conduct 
of donald gregg the us ambassador to south korea in connection 
with the irancontra affair 
gregg was george bushs national security adviser when bush was 
vice president and the sources said that closing down the office of 
independent counsel lawrence walsh would look like a coverup 
walsh has spent nearly four years and tens of millions of tax 
dollars investigating and prosecuting irancontra cases said 
broomfield who was a member of the house investigating panel 
broomfields request comes just days after a divided federal 
appeals court panel set aside norths irancontra convictions 
reversing one of three guilty verdicts and ordering hearings to 
determine whether the other two were tainted by immunized testimony 
north gave congress 
broomfield asked thornburgh to exercise his authority under the 
1987 independent counsel act to seek the termination of walshs 
office and turn over any loose ends in his irancontra 
investigations to the justice department to be tied up 
nobody wants to complete this work more than we do walsh 
said through a spokeswoman we simply dont feel that we can fail 
to develop the testimony of significant witnesses as they become 
available 
north and poindexter were the two highestranking reagan 
administration officials prosecuted in the operation that sent arms 
to iran and covert profits from their sale to nicaraguas contra 
rebels 
walshs investigation which had cost 21 million through may 
has led to the conviction of seven people involved in the 
irancontra affair the justice department says the investigations 
have cost law enforcement agencies an additional 77 million for 
a total of 287 million 
broomfield said the action on norths case focused new attention 
on what he termed walshs perpetual investigation 
the irancontra affair has been thoroughly investigated weve 
paid for two congressional committees a presidential commission 
and an independent counsel broomfield said 
still walsh seems intent on ensconcing himself as part of the 
permanent bureaucracy he said i believe the time has come to 
say enough is enough

a tearful mother used a lifelike rubber 
doll and a porcelain toilet to show jurors tuesday how her husband 
fatally plunged her 2yearold son headfirst into the commode as 
punishment for soiling his pants 
he held him way up here 21yearold sheryl coe testified 
grabbing the doll by the ankles and dunking its head into the 
toilet he flushed the toilet water so the water would flush on 
his head 
thomas coe 23 stared straight down as mrs coe testified that 
bradley mcgees death came after weeks of her husbands torturing 
coe is charged with firstdegree murder and aggravated child abuse 
the state rested its case after mrs coes testimony 
bradley died of head injuries july 28 1989 only two months 
after he was returned from state foster care to his mother and 
stepfather 
mrs coe agreed to testify against her husband after pleading no 
contest to seconddegree murder and aggravated child abuse charges 
she is serving 30 years in prison 
dressed in darkblue prison garb mrs coe said her husbands 
disciplinary methods included forcing bradley to stand in the 
corner with his hands on his head making him eat feces off the 
ground and grinding his fist and cayenne pepper into the childs 
genitals 
she testified that her husband had previously dunked bradley in 
the toilet but the last time came july 27 1989 after coe had 
returned from a job interview 
mrs coe said her husband became furious when she told him the 
child has made a mess in his pants 
tom took him back to the bathroom and dunked his head into the 
toilet several times she said 
she then described how coe threw the boy under a cold shower 
with a clunk and a boom and forced him to walk into the living 
room where they beat him with cushions until he collapsed and 
went into like an epileptic fit 
bradley was taken to lakeland regional medical center after a 
neighbor called for help he was pronounced dead the next day 
in a taped statement played for the jury tuesday coe said he 
meant to scare the child 
i turned him upside down and dunked him into the toilet i 
dont know how many times i did it it happened so fast i flushed 
it just to scare him coe said im sorry i did it i didnt 
mean to do it i lost control it was a bad day all the way 
around 
prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for coe 
defense attorneys concede coe dunked the child into the toilet 
but say he should be convicted of a lesser crime because it was 
merely a onetime form of punishment and there was never any intent 
to harm the child 
they have portrayed mrs coe as an unstable selfserving liar 
arguing that she has changed her account of events at least four 
times 
i was scared i didnt know what to do she said 
bradleys death came after a state department of health and 
rehabilitative services caseworker recommended that a judge return 
the child to his mother despite a psychological report that 
questioned the couples abilities as parents and detailed their 
explosive personalities mrs coe had abandoned bradley at a 
shopping mall when he was 3 months old 
public outrage over bradleys death led legislators to change 
the law placing child welfare above attempts to reunite families 
bradleys main caseworker margaret barber was convicted june 
15 of felony child abuse and sentenced to three months probation 
three other caseworkers were cleared of criminal charges

marion barrys lawyers recalled convicted drug 
dealer charles lewis to the stand tuesday suggesting he was at the 
center of a cocaine and prostitution ring whose members testified 
against the mayor 
defense attorney r kenneth mundy attacked lewis credibility 
and that of five of lewis friends who testified at barrys cocaine 
and perjury trial 
one of the governments chief witnesses lewis testified last 
month that barry used cocaine and crack repeatedly on two trips to 
the virgin islands 
the two smoked crack in a washington dc hotel room after the 
mayor dumped crack rocks out of a matchbox and pulled them out of 
one of his pants cuffs lewis testified earlier 
in recalling lewis mundy sought to undermine other witnesses 
saying that city attorney james mcwilliams and two other men 
discussed a plan to distribute drugs 
there was such a discussion lewis said 
mcwilliams has denied that he was involved in distributing 
drugs but lewis said he supplied mcwilliams with drugs about a 
dozen times 
mcwilliams gave devastating testimony against barry testifying 
he found the mayor slumped on a bathroom toilet seat surrounded by 
narcotics paraphernalia 
mundy asked lewis if four women who testified against barry were 
working with or for him 
no said lewis who has acknowledged that he introduced all 
four to barry when the mayor visited the virgin islands 
mundy asked if lewis made the four women available to 
dignitaries visiting the virgin islands 
lewis said he did not 
did lewis provide drugs to these ladies mundy asked 
we shared lewis said we would put money together 
one of the four women testified that barry forced her to have 
sex with him 
under questioning from mundy lewis said the woman linda crique 
maynard didnt appear to have been distraught after her time alone 
with barry mundy also suggested that maynard was related to one of 
the men who allegedly discussed drug distribution with mcwilliams 
lewis said he didnt know if the two were related 
lewis said he had not heard from the four women since he began 
cooperating with the government last year 
mundy said lewis gave different statements to the fbi a year ago 
than he did at barrys trial 
lewis said law enforcement officers who interviewed him last 
year misunderstood what he said about who saw barry allegedly smoke 
marijuana on a boat trip in the virgin islands 
earlier in the day barrys chauffeur testified that he never 
took the mayor to a municipal building the morning prosecutors say 
barry picked up crack cocaine there 
but on crossexamination by the prosecution walter w bracey 
said he had no memory of barrys specific activities on any day 
other than sept 7 1988 bracey has been the mayors driver for 12 
years 
bracey said he drove to barrys home sept 7 1988 and took him 
directly to the grand opening of a supermarket 
bracey said he then drove barry to fire department headquarters 
for a meeting with city officials barry stayed at the meeting 
until noon 
were there any stops made at any other location mundy asked 
no replied bracey 
former crack dealer lydia reid pearson has testified that she 
went to city offices the morning of sept 7 1988 met with the 
mayor and handed him crack cocaine he gave me the money 
for it and i gave him a job application seeking city 
employment she eventually got a city job 
barry has pleaded innocent to 10 cocaine possession counts one 
count of conspiracy and three counts of lying to a grand jury

a 1000pound bomb detonated by 
terrorists hiding near a rural road in this border city exploded 
tuesday killing a roman catholic nun and three policemen 
authorities said 
an anonymous caller claimed responsibility for the attack on 
behalf of the irish republican army in north armagh in a telephone 
call late tuesday to a news organization in belfast 
the caller said the ira had killed the four people in a 
military action but expressed no regret over the nuns death 
the slaying of a nun would be seen widely as a major 
embarrassment for the mainly catholic ira which in recent months 
has escalated its terror campaign aimed at driving the british out 
of northern ireland 
it was believed to be the first time a catholic nun has been 
killed in 21 years of sectarian violence in britishrun northern 
ireland according to jim cantwell of the catholic press and 
information office 
the terrorist attack one of the deadliest in northern ireland 
this year aroused outrage among political and religious leaders on 
both sides of the irish border 
i know all the people of ireland join me in my condemnation of 
this atrocity prime minister charles haughey of the irish 
republic said in dublin 
the bomb set in a culvert under the road was detonated as an 
unmarked police car passed a hay field two miles outside armagh 
police said the nun and a female social worker were approaching in 
a small car police said 
the blast hurled the police car into the air it smashed into a 
hedge and landed on its roof apparently killing the three 
policemen instantly 
the ground shook beneath us and it was accompanied by a very 
large explosion said paul corr the owner of a nearby gas 
station 
at first we did not see the police car he said the whole 
place was a terrible mess then we saw two young girls in the mini 
metro car they were unconscious and looked in a pretty bad 
way 
corr helped emergency workers from a passing ambulance pull the 
injured women from their car 
the nun sister catherine dunne died later in a hospital her 
companion whose name was not released was listed in satisfactory 
condition police said no ages were available for the two women 
there was nothing we could do for the policemen added corr 
nobody could have come out of that car alive it was dreadful 
the royal ulster constabulary officers who died in the attack 
were identified by police as william hanson 37 david sterritt 
34 and 35yearold joshua willis two of the officers were 
married one with four children and the other with two 
the powerful explosion tore a crater 6feet in diameter in the 
twolane killylea road near the border with the republic of 
ireland the type of explosive used was not known police said 
police and troops rushed reinforcements to the border area to 
search for the attackers the area is considered prime territory 
for operations by the ira 
in belfast a police spokesman said an unknown number of gunmen 
took over a house about 400 yards from the road early tuesday and 
held a married couple and their children at gunpoint until shortly 
before the 2 pm attack 
police said a detonating wire ran from the bomb through a 
freshly cut hayfield to near the house 
the bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack in northern 
ireland since an ira bomb killed four soldiers of the locally 
recruited ulster defense regiment on april 9 
it follows a spate of recent attacks by the ira on british 
targets in england and continental europe 
on friday a bomb caused extensive damage to londons stock 
exchange but no injuries were reported a telephone caller had 
warned of an ira bombing 
in armagh the ancient religious capital of ireland church 
leaders condemned the latest attack the town is the seat of both 
the catholic and anglican churches throughout ireland north and 
south 
i am disgusted declared the most rev robin eames the 
anglican primate of ireland 
my reaction is one of absolute horror that somebody 
fulfilling their own calling as a nun has been murdered in what is 
one more indiscriminate attack on the royal ulster constabulary 
in belfast britains minister for security in northern ireland 
john cope said i have no doubt that we shall hear talk about 
mistakes and about legitimate targets and so on nobody 
deserves to be attacked in this way 
earlier this year the ira expressed regret after gunmen shot 
dead two australian tourists who had been mistaken for british 
soldiers outside a restaurant in holland on may 27 
the slain nun was a member of the sisters of st louis an order 
of about 300 nuns throughout ireland 
nearly 3000 people have been killed since sectarian violence 
erupted in northern ireland in 1969 and the british government sent 
in troops 
the ira outlawed on both sides of the border is fighting to 
unite protestantdominated northern ireland with the overwhelmingly 
catholic republic of ireland under a socialist government

the white house lacks accessible restrooms and 
other facilities for disabled visitors and employees a congressman 
said tuesday 
rep mel levine dcalif said in a letter to president bush 
that a bewildering contradiction exists between the presidents 
plans to sign major disabilities rights legislation and the 
existence of barriers to the disabled at the white house 
a white house spokeswoman alixe glen said there would be no 
comment until the letter is received 
according to levines office 
a former park ranger at the white house routinely crossed 
pennsylvania avenue and lafayette park to find a restroom she could 
enter with her wheelchair when she complained she was told to 
drink fewer liquids 
some of the 30 children in wheelchairs who attended the easter 
egg hunt on the white house lawn this year had to leave early 
because they couldnt use the portable toilets provided for 
visitors 
unlike the capitol the white house provides no special tours 
for visitors with impaired hearing or vision 
bush plans to sign the americans with disabilities act this 
week the bill guarantees disabled employees and customers access 
to the workplace and to public accommodations 
federal buildings already are covered by a 1973 law and levine 
aide jon cowan said he could find nothing in that law to exempt the 
white house 
president franklin d roosevelt used a wheelchair as a result of 
polio but cowan said that none of the physical adjustments in the 
white house made for roosevelt make life easier for visitors or 
employees

house gop whip newt gingrich opening what 
could become a bitter partisan fight said tuesday he favors a 
censure rather than a milder reprimand of rep barney frank for 
using his office to help a male prostitute 
gingrich said he was not speaking for the house leadership but 
his role as the chambers secondranking republican could influence 
conservatives wavering between a censure and the lesser reprimand 
proposed by the ethics committee 
the georgia republicans action leaves gop members divided over 
how to punish frank a massachusetts democrat while the committee 
resolution is scheduled for floor action thursday a move to expel 
frank could be introduced and debated wednesday by conservative gop 
rep william e dannemeyer of california the resolution which 
would need a twothirds vote faces certain defeat 
republican floor leader bob michel of illinois has not announced 
his position but one influential member rep john t myers of 
indiana said he will defend the reprimand in his role as ranking 
gop member of the ethics committee 
gingrich also must contend with democratic leaders who are 
strongly backing the reprimand speaker thomas s foley of 
washington emphasized monday and again tuesday that he expected the 
unanimous ethics committee vote for a reprimand to be upheld the 
panel has six republicans and six democrats 
while gingrich went public at a news conference a group of 
franks liberal colleagues were quietly lobbying house members to 
uphold the committee 
a reprimand is the lowest form of punishment voted on by the 
full house and would involve approval of the ethics report 
franks presence would not be required 
a censure would require frank to stand before his colleagues 
during the procedure also democratic caucus rules would require 
frank after a censure to be stripped of his chairmanship of the 
house judiciary subcommittee on administrative law and governmental 
relations 
the most extreme punishment is expulsion but even gingrich said 
the action would be too extreme 
but gingrichs support of censure was enough to raise the 
political temperature as frank released an angry statement in 
response to the announcement 
i am disappointed that there are efforts to politicize the 
ethics committee report in sharp contrast to practice in the house 
in virtually every case frank wrote as i said last week i 
believe the ethics committees 10month long study has resulted in 
an accurate report and an appropriate recommendation 
gingrich said he based his conclusion on one of two official 
actions by frank that according to the committee brought 
discredit upon the house 
he referred to a 1986 frank memo that contained misleading 
information favorable to the male prostitute stephen l gobie who 
was convicted of sex and drug charges and was on probation at the 
time 
the memo was written on franks official letterhead to an 
individual whose name was deleted by the ethics committee but it 
wound up in the hands of a virginia prosecutor 
should a united states congressman be allowed to misinform an 
officer of the court which is the kinder way of saying to lie to 
an officer of the court on behalf of a convicted felon who was a 
cocaine dealer and a child pornographer gingrich said at a news 
conference 
censure seems to me the minimum appropriate action gingrich 
said 
the ethics committee also said frank broke the rules when he 
used his office to have 33 parking tickets incurred by gobie 
dismissed and recommended that the house order him to make 
restitution to the district of columbia 
gingrich insisted he was not engaging in gaybashing and 
commented franks private behavior is private his sexual 
preferences are personal and i dont think they have any business 
in this dialogue

the deeply divided parliament failed to 
elect a state president on tuesday to replace socialist petar 
mladenov who resigned on july 6 in a row over asking for tanks to 
be used against demonstrators 
two rounds of voting failed to produce the twothirds majority 
needed in the 400seat parliament to elect one of the three 
candidates 
contending were chavdar kyuranov of the governing socialist 
party formerly the communist party petar dertliev leader of the 
social democrats and the candidate of the opposition union of 
democratic forces or udf and viktor valkov of the mainstream 
agrarian party which formerly was a communist ally 
in the first round kyuranov got 217 of the 383 valid ballots 
cast dertliev got 130 and valkov 36 
a journalist for bulgarias official news agency bta said that 
in the second round with fewer valid ballots cast kyuranov got 
211 votes dertliev 131 and valkov 37 
to win 267 votes are needed the socialists hold 211 seats the 
udf 144 and the agrarians 16 also holding seats are six 
independents and 23 members of the movement for rights and 
freedoms which is mainly supported by members of bulgarias 1 
million ethnic turkish minority 
the deep political rifts and the distribution of the seats made 
it unlikely any of the three candidates would secure the twothirds 
majority 
political analysts and some deputies suggested that new 
candidates may be suggested following tuesdays inconclusive votes 
balloting opened after four days of procedural wrangling between 
the socialists and udf opposition leader zhelyu zhelev threatened 
a walkout of his deputies tuesday if there was no halt in what he 
called the obstructive tactics of the socialists 
bulgaria has been without a president since mladenov resigned 18 
days ago after experts confirmed a recording on which he called for 
tanks to move against antigovernment demonstrators last december 
no tanks were used but mladenov previously had denied making the 
comment 
at tuesdays nationally televised parliament session each 
candidate outlined his program for dealing with spreading social 
and political unrest and bulgarias growing economic crisis 
kyuranov a 69yearold philosopher once expelled from the 
communist party for his dissident views appealed for a coalition 
government but said the socialists should face up to the 
responsibility of their communist precursors for bulgarias woes 
dertliev 73 recalled the repression of noncommunist forces 
after world war ii when he himself was imprisoned for his 
political views 
he pleaded for tolerance now and alone of the three candidates 
expressed support for peaceful political protests that have spread 
since last months elections won by the socialists

supreme court nominee david souter was 
affiliated with two new hampshire hospitals that perform abortions 
but officials at both facilities said tuesday that souter never 
discussed the divisive issue 
as with his judicial record little about souters feelings 
about abortion can be gleaned from his performance as a board 
member of concord hospital or as an overseer to the dartmouth 
hitchcock medical school which has an affiliated hospital that 
performs abortions 
both hospitals have abortion guidelines new hampshire still has 
a law making some abortions tantamount to a felony 
but those laws which have not been enforced since the 1973 roe 
vs wade decision that legalized abortion never became an issue 
while souter was serving either on the state superior or supreme 
courts 
as a judge souter participated in just one known case dealing 
with abortion siding with the majority in a 1986 ruling that said 
physicians have a responsibility to test unborn children for birth 
defects and in the event defects are detected to counsel the 
pregnant woman about options including abortion 
officials at the two hospitals said they had no recollection of 
souter discussing abortion at meetings or in personal conversations 
over the course of time that ive been here that issue never 
came before the board said richard warner president of concord 
hospital he and i never talked about it 
warner came to the hospital in may 1975 when souter was a 
member of its board souter was president of the board from 197885 
warner and others couldnt provide a specific number but said 
relatively few abortions are performed at the hospital the 
procedure usually is done at area clinics or doctors offices the 
hospital officials said 
at concord hospital and several area clinics its customary not 
to perform abortions after 17 weeks seven weeks short of the end 
of the second trimester said hospital spokeswoman beth fensterwald 
one exception is dartmouth hitchcock where officials said there 
had been rare occasions when abortions have been performed up to 
the end of the second trimester those cases almost exclusively 
involve potential harm to the pregnant women officials said 
written abortion guidelines at dartmouth hitchcock acknowledge a 
split among physicians and other staff over whether abortions 
should be performed 
we feel very strongly that our patients have all alternatives 
discussed with them the guidelines say 
dr george a little chairman of dartmouth hitchcocks child 
and maternal health department said it was possible that the 
facility would refuse to perform an abortion for a woman past 17 
weeks who didnt have a medical reason 
souter served on the overseers for the dartmouth medical school 
which is affiliated with the hospital 
dr robert mccollum who retired as dean of the medical school 
three weeks ago but remains on staff said the overseers had no 
role in hospital affairs 
he said that during the twiceayear overseers meetings souter 
never mentioned the word abortion nor was the question raised 
during any meetings

engineers and photographers from the united 
states japan west germany and britain have begun a 
hightechnology investigation into what causes the mysterious 
circles that appear suddenly among crops in england and elsewhere 
in europe 
equipped with 18 million worth of heatseeking cameras and 
other sophisticated gear they will be watching fields in the 
southwest county of wiltshire for the next three weeks 
they will try to capture on film whatever it is that flattens 
crops in decorative patters of perfectly formed circles some with 
concentric rings and other shapes 
the circles have been variously attributed to whirlwinds 
witches magnetic forces animals hoaxers and spaceships 
team members are using light and sound equipment to try to 
locate the source in the vale of pewsey a hilly district dividing 
wiltshire between salisbury plain and the marlborough downs 75 
miles southwest of london 
the circles were recorded in england as far back as 1678 but 
circles which appeared in a vale of pewsey wheat field last week 
were more elaborate than usual the circles were linked and some 
had flattened straight areas like arms projecting from them 
in other countries circles have been reported in sand snow and 
rice paddies 
colin andrews coordinator of the watch which began on monday 
said this is a determined effort to secure on highquality film 
the full event whatever that event will ultimately turn out to 
be 
amateur photographers who spent a night in the area last year

president bush and congressional democrats 
agreed during a twohour budget session tuesday to tone down 
political attacks but failed to narrow crucial differences on 
curing the federal deficit 
at a later meeting administration officials and congressional 
leaders of both parties failed again to agree to the overall size 
and components of the cuts they would make in next years budget 
but house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said the two 
sides could agree to the overall outline of a package by wednesday 
its not as easy as it looks gephardt said 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn 
confirmed that the general consensus of the negotiators remained a 
package of about 50 billion in savings for next year divided 
about evenly between tax increases and spending cuts the 
bargainers have informally been using those numbers for several 
weeks 
the sides agreed to a political ceasefire after bush blistered 
democrats last week at fundraising events around the country and 
democrats responded in kind 
hell be very gentle from now on white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said of bush 
we need to concentrate on reducing partisan comments said 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash adding that the peace pact 
applied to political campaign committees as well as individuals 
at a midday speech to a gop audience in philadelphia bush said 
he saluted those democrats in the leadership who are now working 
with me in reaching a budget agreement 
however he renewed his appeal for a constitutional amendment to 
balance the budget saying it would end what he called an budget 
charade and fiscal follies in congress 
he also said that spending was out of control in 
democratcontrolled house appropriations bills 
asked about bushs remarks gephardt said the president has 
to decide all of us have to decide if we want to bring this 
budget summit to a conclusion 
a participant in tuesdays budget bargaining speaking on 
condition of anonymity said no substantial progress was made 
all the white house wants to talk about are entitlement cuts 
and domestic discretionary spending the negotiator said 
entitlements are federal benefit programs such as social 
security and medicare the administration wants to cut those 
programs by about 14 billion while democrats would like to limit 
the reductions to 10 billion or less 
domestic discretionary programs cover general government 
initiatives such as environmental cleanups and air traffic 
control republicans are more interested in cutting such programs 
than are democrats 
one of the things discussed today was to stop the political 
debate and start the substantive debate and to try to cut down on 
the political comment thats gone on on all sides gephardt said 
i think youre going to see that that will happen he added 
i think a lot of thats out of everybodys system 
in political speeches last week bush ridiculed the budget 
process and suggested that it was the democrats turn to make 
concessions on taxes and spending 
fitzwater told reporters on air force one en route to 
philadelphia that bush and the democrats were working in a spirit 
of harmony and compromise 
they agreed this morning at the meeting that they would try to 
keep the rhetoric under control and really try to make this a 
productive week of work fitzwater said 
another white house session with the five top congressional 
leaders gephardt senate majority leader george mitchell senate 
minority leader bob dole foley and house minority leader bob 
michel was scheduled for wednesday morning 
at the same time a larger group of budget negotiators was 
meeting on capitol hill tuesday in an effort to narrow differences 
despite the political truce bush and congress seemed no closer 
to agreeing on a way to close the deficit gap than they were before 
the president revoked his 1988 no new taxes pledge in early 
july 
the administration estimates that the deficit for fiscal 1991 
which begins oct 1 will be nearly 169 billion more than 100 
billion over the 64 billion target set by the grammrudman 
budgetbalancing law 
foley dwash said decisions remain on the precise amount of 
deficit reduction that would be sought and how much of it would 
come from new taxes and spending cuts 
i dont think there is at this point a clear definition of 
what each side wants foley told reporters 
noting mondays 56point plunge in the dow jones industrial 
average gephardt said all through this i think people have been 
worried that the market is very touchy and the whole economy is 
very shaky

a cialinked airline would remain a target of a 
135 million lawsuit filed by an american mercenary embroiled in 
the irancontra scandal a judge ruled tuesday 
jury selection in the lawsuit filed by eugene hasenfus against 
retired gen richard secord and miamibased southern air transport 
was scheduled to begin wednesday 
hasenfus a cargo handler or kicker aboard a c123 
secretly supplying the nicaraguan rebels was captured after 
nicaraguan troops shot down the plane in october 1986 
he was the only survivor of the crash which revealed details 
about us government involvement in the flights the reagan 
administration later admitted that profits from arms sales to iran 
were diverted to the contras despite a congressional ban on us 
military aid to the rebels who sought to overthrow the leftist 
nicaraguan government 
the sandinista government held hasenfus of marinette wis for 
about three months 
in 1988 hasenfus sued secord and southern air an airline once 
owned by the cia and which continued to work under contract with 
the us government 
the family of a crewman who died aboard the plane wallace 
sawyer jr has joined hasenfus in a parallel suit that will be 
tried at the same time 
southern air denies participating in the contra supply operation 
however senior us district judge c clyde atkins ruled to 
keep the airline as a defendant 
that was a good ruling for us and it was a fair ruling 
said hasenfus attorney marc sarnoff 
southern air attorney david kirstein said the ruling would limit 
the scope of the case to a contract dispute rather than a review of 
the irancontra affair 
now it wont be a freeforall kirstein said 
atkins also dropped a wrongful death claim from the sawyer 
family suit but allowed negligence claims to stand 
both hasenfus and wallace sawyer sr father of the dead 
copilot refused to comment tuesday 
the lawsuit claims hasenfus was recruited in 1986 through the 
pennsylvania airline corporate air services and william cooper a 
southern air pilot 
cooper who also died in the crash led hasenfus to believe 
the contra resupply operation was being run right out of the 
back door of the white house by former reagan administration 
aide oliver north secord and southern air according to the 
lawsuit 
secord a retired air force major general pleaded guilty to 
lying to congressional investigators and was sentenced in january 
to two years probation 
the lawsuit claims secord misrepresented the nature of the 
flights and failed to take routine safety precautions 
hasenfus said he was led to believe he was working for southern 
air through its subsidiary corporate air on behalf of the us 
government in reality the lawsuit claims secord was engaged in a 
profitmaking scheme 
the lawsuit also describes the plane as wholly inadequate and 
dilapidated lacking such basic safety equipment as parachutes 
secords attorneys describe hasenfus as a mercenary earning 
about 3000 a month who knew the risks associated with the 
flight 
north and elliot abrams former assistant secretary of state for 
latin american affairs gave depositions for the trial expected to 
testify is felix rodriguez the cia official who ran the contra 
supply operation out of el salvador

at 330 pm monday president bush summoned 
aides to the oval office and asked how quickly they could call a 
news conference he wanted to announce his supreme court nominee 
that afternoon 
told they could be ready by 430 pm bush said id like 
another halfhour because he needed more time to make up his 
mind a senior administration official said tuesday 
this official who accompanied bush on a campaign trip tuesday 
recalled events this way he spoke with reporters on condition that 
his name not be used 
bush had spent much of monday afternoon interviewing the two 
finalists for the high court vacancy both federal appellate 
judges edith jones 41 of houston and david souter 50 of 
concord nh 
a third circuit court judge lawrence silberman of washington 
had been ruled out of the running sunday night according to the 
source who asked not to be identified 
souter had been summoned to washington sunday night spending 
the night in the home of j michael luttig a justice department 
lawyer whom he had never met before luttig is an acting assistant 
attorney general in charge of the office of legal counsel 
bush headed into his living quarters at the white house after 
saying goodbye to the president of ecuador monday afternoon there 
bush spent 45 minutes interviewing souter whom he placed on the 
1st us circuit court of appeals in boston just three months ago 
white house counsel c boyden gray had already grilled souter 
that morning about whether there was anything in his background 
that might prove embarrassing such as the marijuana use that 
forced douglas ginsburg to withdraw as a reagan administration 
nominee to the supreme court in 1987 
souters answers were all satisfactory the source said 
bush filled three yellow legalsized pages with notes on souter 
under the heading plusses and minuses 
he then returned to the west wing or business side of the white 
house to interview jones 
afterwards both candidates cooled their heels elsewhere in the 
white house while bush made up his mind souter was in the office 
of andrew card the deputy white house chief of staff 
at 415 pm bush summoned his press secretary marlin 
fitzwater to the oval office 
i have selected judge souter heres the bio wheres the 
judge the president asked they agreed to proceed with a 5 pm 
announcement in the white house briefing room and fitzwater told 
reporters clustered outside his office that the president would be 
having a news conference with his nominee 
bush had filled out 2 more pages of his thoughts about the 
selection concluding that souter was the right person for the job 
the president was impressed by the fact that hes a humble 
man quiet studious the official said you get a sense of 
confidence that heres a serious person thats truly a student of 
the law 
bush called souter into his private study next to the oval 
office to offer him the job souter said he would be honored 
theres also a feeling this is a guy who wants to be a supreme 
court justice and is willing to devote his life to it the 
official said 
souter with an evident five oclock shadow was really kind 
of dazed when the walked into the briefing room with bush 
he doesnt know beans about a press conference the official 
said 
souter had been told to expect to say a few words but not to 
take questions bush didnt give the judge a chance until fitzwater 
slipped the president a note several questions into the news 
conference 
when justice william j brennan jr announced his surprise 
resignation friday bush was prepared 
the president had been advised there would be an opportunity 
to name someone to the court in all likelihood in his first term 
the official said 
also it became clear that some of the special interests 
particularly abortion and a few others were going to try to build 
a public stew for this nominee to be dumped into if bush failed 
to move quickly the official said 
after the announcement the president souter attorney general 
dick thornburgh gray and white house chief of staff john sununu 
walked back to the oval office to watch television coverage 
souter called his mother at a nursing home in concord and 
eventually spent the night at the home of john schmidtz a deputy 
white house counsel

boy scout and girl scout movements are making a 
strong comeback in eastern europe after decades of communist 
repression the world organization of the scout movement said 
tuesday after readmitting hungary and czechoslovakia 
scouting officials attending the 32nd world conference of 
scouting also received encouraging news about the prospects for the 
movements revival in the soviet union where communistcontrolled 
youth leagues replaced the prerevolutionary scouting groups 
in a letter read at the conference tuesday soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev praised the noble objectives of the 
scouting movement 
he also thanked the world organization for helping 1235 youths 
from the region around the stricken chernobyl nuclear power plant 
spend summer vacations in western europe 
gorbachevs letter was read by albert lichanov president of the 
soviet childrens fund he said the soviet union no longer sought 
to prevent the formation of independent youth organizations 
more and more scouting movements exist he said 
jacques moreillon secretary general of the world organization 
said the soviets had given a green light for the rebirth of 
scouting in the ussr 
scoutings status in eastern europe was a major topic during the 
first full day of the weeklong conference which has brought 
together about 1000 officials of national scouting organizations 
in more than 100 countries 
in the past two years there has been a spectacular renewal of 
scouting in eastern europe a spontaneous intense movement 
the world organization said in a memorandum distributed at the 
conference 
the conference opened monday night with a welcoming message from 
president francois mitterrand 
mitterrand saluted the scouting movements universality and 
said its renaissance in eastern europe shows that scouting 
doesnt exist without democracy 
hungary and czechoslovakia were among several countries accepted 
this week as members of the world organization others include 
guinea comoros and newly independent namibia 
hungary and czechoslovakia had scouting programs until the 
1950s when they were suppressed by communist authorities the 
programs survived clandestinely with occasional brief periods of 
legalization until restrictions were lifted in 1988 
hungary now has about 10000 scouts and czechoslovakia more 
than 70000 according to the world scout bureau it also 
summarized the past and present status of scouting elsewhere in 
eastern europe 
the soviet union there were nearly 100000 scouts prior to 
1917 but the movement was suppressed after the bolshevik 
revolution now scouting has revived in the baltic republics and 
the formation of scouting groups elsewhere is considered likely 
poland an active scouting program existed before world war ii 
in postwar years the movement dropped out of the world 
organization but an initiative began in march to qualify for 
readmission through policy reforms 
east germany romania and bulgaria scouting movements in these 
countries were persecuted systematically by the nazis and their 
allies in the 1930s and never were reestablished fully east 
germanys program is expected to merge with west germanys after 
unification but in bulgaria and romania the world scout bureau 
said there are still great difficulties to overcome 
the bureau is the central office for the world organization of 
the scout movement which represents about 16 million scouts in 150 
countries and territories 
the largest scouting movements are in the united states with 39 
million scouts the philippines and indonesia with about 2 million 
india with 12 million and britain with 681000

a lawyer who had been threatened with 
arrest for his links to the campaign for multiparty democracy 
emerged from hiding tuesday to hold what he termed a positive 
meeting with president daniel arap moi 
the lawyer paul muite said moi criticized some of his views 
during their wideranging 40minute discussion at the presidents 
official residence but added that overall the meeting was cordial 
muite said moi told him he was free to return to work 
the talks come one day after muite issued a statement calling 
for the release of political detainees he also denied involvement 
in recent politically inspired riots in which at least 28 people 
died 
moi on sunday accused muite of fomenting the violence and urged 
him to come out of hiding and apologize in person 
muite went underground july 5 one day after two of his clients 
former cabinet ministers charles rubia and kenneth matiba were 
detained under security statutes that allow them to be held 
indefinitely without charge 
the politicians had been at the forefront of the campaign to 
legalize opposition parties 
following the arrest of rubia and matiba 15 other people linked 
to the democracy campaign were arrested 
muite said mois only mention of the political detainees was to 
say that he does not take any pleasure in detaining people 
i thought that was very positive muite told the associated 
press in a telephone interview 
moi has come under criticism at home and abroad for the 
detentions of the prodemocracy activists and his governments

a federal judge stopped the justice 
departments antipornography unit from prosecuting a mailorder 
distributor of sexuallyoriented magazines and videos in more than 
one jurisdiction 
us district judge joyce hens green issued the preliminary 
injunction on monday after finding evidence to suggest that federal 
prosecutors had investigated phe inc with the intention of 
forcing the north carolina company also known as adam and eve 
out of business 
the allegations by the company and its owner philip d harvey 
suggest a concerted effort through harassment and threats of 
multiple prosecution to suppress plaintiffs constitutionally 
protected activities the judge said 
she issued a preliminary injunction barring the justice 
department from bringing charges in more than one federal 
jurisdiction at one time 
bruce ennis who represented the company said the justice 
departments national obscenity enforcement unit has pursued a 
strategy of trying to wear down the financial resources of sexually 
oriented businesses by threatening to bring a series of indictments 
in numerous jurisdictions 
he said greens ruling casts a real cloud over the national 
obscenity enforcement units new tactic of threatening multiple 
indictments as a way of coercing adult materials distributors to go 
out of business 
ennis presented evidence that the justice department used 
similar tactics to force pak ventures another distributor of adult 
magazines and videos to go out of business 
in her ruling green noted that it is not without significance 
that defendants have not contested disputed or refuted any of the 
factual assertions contained in the declarations presented by 
plaintiffs 
taken as a whole these allegations suggest a concerted effort 
by the defendants through harassment and threats of multiple 
prosecutions to suppress plaintiffs constitutionally protected 
activities 
intrusive and intimidating searches of the companys 
carrboro nc offices and the admitted desire to get harvey 
out of business substantiate plaintiffs allegations of bad 
faith green ruled 
federal prosecutors in utah and the western district of kentucky 
had threatened to bring charges against adam and eve 
earlier threats were made in the eastern district of north 
carolina even though the fbi had advised prosecutors that the 
materials distributed by phe were not obscene by bureau standards 
according to the ruling 
in 1988 another federal judge issued a similar injunction to 
bar multiple prosecutions of avram freedberg and his stamford 
conn company freedberg ultimately entered a guilty plea agreed 
to get out of the mailorder business and dropped his lawsuit

a red cross relief team crossed police 
barricades and distributed relief supplies tuesday to the mohawks 
at oka the second such convoy since an armed standoff began july 
11 between indians and quebec police 
efforts to end the confrontation have stalled the dispute arose 
over attempts to expand a golf course onto what natives say is 
ancestral land one policeman has been killed but responsibility 
in the death has not been fixed 
the mohawks of kanasetake refused conditions set monday by the 
quebec government for resuming negotiations 
red cross official linda gauthier said the agency distributed 
milk bread bananas oranges laundry soap sanitary napkins and 
toilet paper on tuesday and hopes to be able to check on the 
situation every two or three days 
she had made a spot check in indian territory monday night and 
other food or medical supplies did not appear to be needed ms 
gauthier said no one was starving but there are vulnerable 
people who need regular medical monitoring 
she said the red cross now needs written agreement by all 
parties in the dispute before each visit and is trying to 
negotiate a blanket agreement that will allow regular trips into 
kanasetake every three or four days 
the kanasetake mohawks have drawn support from other indians 
across canada including roadblocks in british columbia and a 
blockade by other mohawks of the mercier bridge into montreal 18 
miles from oka 
the federal government of prime minister brian mulroney so far 
has left it up to quebec provincial authorities to resolve the 
dispute 
the mohawks demanded that mulroneys government become involved 
and also appealed to president bush and the united nations among 
others 
a representative of the mohawks atsenhaienton also known as 
kenneth deer was in europe to gain international attention for the 
confrontation he planned to visit embassies in geneva to ask for 
economic sanctions on canada 
he will argue that canadas treatment of aboriginal people is on

a story of sexual abuse prostitution and 
judicial bribery told to a legislative committee investigating an 
omaha credit union failure was a carefully crafted hoax a 
grand jury said tuesday 
in a 42page report the douglas county grand jury debunked many 
of the rumors that have surrounded the 1988 failure of the franklin 
community federal credit union 
besides its report the grand jury also issued three 
indictments two of them charging perjury against witnesses who 
claimed to the legislature that they were victims 
a federal grand jury also is investigating franklinrelated 
matters the county grand jury said it decided that financial 
matters including a fund shortage of about 39 million were best 
left to the federal grand jury 
perhaps never in the history of douglas county has the 
discordant multitude played so feverishly upon the rumor pipe as in 
the allegations of sexual misconduct surrounding franklin the 
grand jury report said 
in the wake of the franklin collapse allegations and rumors 
arose of sexual abuse of children of an adult male homosexual 
prostitution ring of drug use and cult activities some involving 
prominent citizens 
the grand jury cited many prominent residents by name and 
cleared them of wrongdoing its report indicated that the names may 
have been raised in rumors because of their prominence 
the grand jury said it found no credible evidence of child 
sexual abuse interstate transportation of minors drug trafficking 
or participation in a pornography ring by former franklin manager 
lawrence e king jr or other franklin officials and employees 
king a prominent businessman who sang the national anthem at 
the 1984 republican national convention still faces 40 counts in 
federal court of conspiracy fraud and federal income tax evasion 
he is accused of diverting money for personal use he was ruled 
incompetent to stand trial and is receiving psychiatric treatment 
those indicted by the grand jury included alisha j owen and 
paul a bonacci who had claimed they were victims and gave 
videotaped statements to the special legislative committee 
investigating franklinrelated matters 
there is no doubt after reviewing all relevant evidence that 
the story of sexual abuse drugs prostitution and judicial 
bribery presented in the legislative videotapes is a carefully 
crafted hoax scripted by a person or persons with considerable 
knowledge of the people and institutions of omaha the grand jury 
report said 
ms owen 21 of omaha was charged with eight counts of perjury 
and bonacci 22 also of omaha was indicted on three counts of 
perjury 
the grand jury also handed up an indictment charging two counts 
of pandering against alan a baer 67 an omaha businessman who 
once owned an omahabased department store chain 
the indictment accused baer of giving something of value to two 
males to become a prostitute or commit an act of prostitution but 
the grand jury reported it didnt find any connection between baer 
and the credit union 
its report said many of the allegations made against baer were 
false and it appears baer was written into the script because of 
his wealth 
baers office referred calls to his attorney steve seline who 
stressed that baer was cleared of any sexual exploitation of 
minors seline said the pandering charges against baer which 
involved adults were incorrect and inappropriate 
ms owen is serving time in the nebraska center for women in 
york for writing bad checks she was declining all interviews said 
lawrence wayne superintendent of the womens prison 
her attorney henry c rosenthal jr was out of town and 
unavailable for comment tuesday his omaha office said 
bonacci is serving time in the lincoln correctional center for 
sexually assaulting a boy and could not be reached for comment 
tuesday 
the grand jury reported it hadnt found any evidence to support 
allegations against former omaha worldherald publisher harold 
andersen in march andersen acknowledged he had been named in the 
rumors and said he had done nothing improper 
the grand jury found no evidence to support allegations that 
harold andersen was involved in sexual misconduct of other illegal 
activity said the grand jury report 
andersens only connection with franklin was as cochair of the 
fundraising committee for a new credit union building the motive 
for naming him was probably politically generated due to his 
position as publisher of the omaha worldherald at that time it 
said 
the grand jury said michael casey a former omaha resident who 
has described himself as an investigative freelance reporter 
helped spread the rumors 
casey 45 was arrested monday on a south dakota warrant for 
allegedly writing an insufficientfund check 23 months ago the 
arrest came less than an hour after he finished testifying before 
the federal grand jury in omaha 
the county grand jury report said casey became fascinated with 
the franklin case and endeavored to cover the real franklin 
story listening to street rumors spending time with members of 
omahas gay community and seeking out potential victimwitnesses

the national endowment for the arts has asked an 
outpost of avantgarde art to provide a detailed description of its 
upcoming season within 30 days or face a loss of funding both 
parties said tuesday 
the endowment called it a routine request but the franklin 
furnace archives a manhattan museum that presents experimental 
performance and visual art described it as harassment aimed at 
performances some consider obscene 
the nea is making this request because the furnaces whole 
purpose on this earth is to show avantgarde art said barbara 
pollack the museums spokeswoman such art doesnt fit in with 
sen jesse helms definition of what should receive funding 
she added 
the four performance artists whom the nea turned down for grants 
in june have performed at franklin furnace or received funding from 
it pollack said and an installation by karen finley one of the 
four is currently on display at the organizations gallery 
in one of her performance pieces finley dances nude and smears 
her body with chocolate to show the degradation of women 
martha wilson founder and director of franklin furnace was 
traveling and unavailable for comment on the endowments request 
the request came after franklin furnace was notified in early 
june that the nea had approved a 20000 grant for its visual and 
performing arts programs and a 7500 grant for audience 
development 
the museum accepted the grant signing the antiobscenity pledge 
the nea requires of grantees congress last year put strings on 
government aid to the arts by adding language to a 1990 spending 
bill that forbids the endowment from funding works that might be 
deemed obscene 
in a letter dated july 13 but received monday the nea asked 
franklin furnace for identification of the artists involved and 
the nature of the work to be performed or installed in order to 
make a final determination on its grant application 
failure to respond to the request within 30 days will result 
in the rejection of this application julianne r davis the 
endowments general counsel wrote to franklin furnace 
the neas request was first reported in the philadelphia 
inquirer on tuesday 
in a statement tuesday davis said a number of endowment 
programs have for many years routinely required the submission of 
additional information at appropriate times 
many arts organizations have not fully booked their upcoming 
season when they apply for grants and it is not unusual for the 
nea to later request a description of what is planned said kathy 
christie an endowment spokeswoman 
pollack is suspicious however she cited a june 21 call from 
the general accounting office asking for information on four 
performance artists including finley she said the gao had been 
asked by helms the republican senator from north carolina in 
march to look into possible violations of law by the nea 
now she said what they want to do is get a broader list of 
who to investigate we do not want to assist them in developing a 
blacklist

sandinista police recovered 10 
surfacetoair red eye missiles from former rebels interior 
minister carlos hurtado said tuesday a sign that the contra 
guerrillas kept some weapons when they demobilized 
hurtado in charge of police and security forces also said two 
armed men captured saturday admit being members of the farabundo 
marti national liberation front the salvadoran guerrilla alliance 
he told a news conference at the foreign correspondents club 
that the two would be turned over to a third country but did not 
elaborate 
police on monday recovered three of the heatseeking missiles in 
ciudad rama and the other seven in el almendro 
both towns are in southeastern nicaragua and el almendro is the 
heart of one of the development centers the former rebels have been 
promised 
hurtado did not say whether arrests were made or give details on 
how the missiles were recovered except to say they had been held by 
former contras 
by the time the contras disarmed in midjune they had turned in 
more than 100 red eyes among thousands of other weapons 
but it has been estimated that before the united states stopped 
military aid to the guerrillas in february 1989 it gave the 
contras about 400 red eyes 
hurtado said the 10 missiles would be turned over to a united 
nations mission supervising regional peace accords including 
contra demobilization and would be destroyed 
despite contra demobilization after president violeta barrios de 
chamorro took office april 25 thousands of weapons remain in 
private hands 
the outgoing sandinistas turned over huge quantities to their 
supporters before leaving office the new government asked that the 
weapons be turned in but made no move to force the issue 
sandinistas still dominate the army and police force 
hurtado said police have intercepted 1100 pounds of cocaine 
since mrs chamorro became president he said drug traffickers seem 
to be taking advantage of peacetime conditions in nicaragua to use 
the country as a transfer point

secretary of state james a baker iii will 
take up with his soviet counterpart hints from moscow of a 
readiness to make a deal aimed at ending the 12yearold civil war 
in afghanistan an administration official said tuesday 
but the official disputed a report from moscow by abc news that 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and baker already 
had cut a deal 
baker leaves wednesday on a fournation trip to asia he is 
scheduled to meet shevardnadze in the soviet siberian city of 
irkutsk on aug 1 
the soviets have not yet conveyed to the united states how 
afghan president najibullah might be removed from power in kabul 
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
for weeks the bush administration has hoped for a breakthrough 
to end to war between afghan government forces armed by the soviet 
union and a guerrilla coalition fighting with americansupplied 
weapons funnelled through pakistan 
but the soviets failed this month to send a delegation to 
washington for talks on the major obstacle to a settlement based on 
a ceasefire and elections that is when najibullah should yield 
power both sides already have reached a tacit agreement that 
najibullah would play no role in the new government and would step 
down at some point before his successor take over 
the soviets hinted at a deal they havent fleshed it out 
the official said the thread of the deal is going to be pursued 
in irkutsk by baker 
administration officials did not find fault with moscow for not 
sending the delegation to washington they said they thought the 
kremlin was simply preoccupied with the 28th communist party 
congress at the time 
but when baker saw shevardnadze in paris last wednesday again 
there was no major development on the afghan front the official 
said 
the soviet union installed the najibullah government in 1979 
but the government in kabul has been unable to impose its will on 
the countryside the soviets withdrew their troops last year but 
continued arms supply 
both superpowers have grown weary of the effort to defeat the 
other sides client in afghanistan the senate intelligence 
committee according to congressional sources reflected this 
disenchantment tuesday in voting for a cut about 100 million in 
the current 300 million annual aid for afghan rebels 
in a report attributed to unspecified western diplomatic 
sources abc said the bakershevardnadze agreement called for an 
end to arms supplies for both sides the united states had 
abandoned its position that najibullah must go 
the official who spoke with the associated press called the 
network report premature 
the 2hour paris meeting was dominated by cambodia afterward 
baker announced that the united states had withdrawn its 
diplomatic support from a rebel coalition that included the khmer 
rouge and would hold talks with vietnam supporter of the 
government in phnom penh and an ally of the soviet union 
the state department announced tuesday that kenneth quinn a 
deputy assistant secretary will meet with vietnams ambassador to 
the united nations in new york on aug 6 
on his asia trip baker will also attend a meeting of the 
association of southeast asian nations in indonesia hold talks in 
singapore and visit to outer mongolia after seeing shevardnadze

iran asked the world court on 
tuesday for punitive damages and compensation from the us 
government for the july 3 1988 downing of an iranian commercial 
jetliner by a us navy missile 
the 300page brief termed a memorial in world court parlance 
apparently set no monetary figures all 290 people aboard the 
airbus were killed 
iran also asked the court to order the united states to refrain 
from violating international law and rebuked the us government 
for its continued naval presence in the persian gulf 
the airbus was hit by a missile from the uss vincennes part 
of a task force in the gulf during the iraniraq war the jet 
bound from bandar abbas to dubai was mistaken as an attacking 
warplane in the closing days of the war 
investigations showed the plane was in a normal climbing pattern 
when hit 
iran also submitted three volumes of exhibits 
it sought compensation for families of the victims of the airbus 
downing for the tehran government and for the airline iran air 
it asked punitive damages for what it called the criminal 
nature of the act 
iran demanded a reparations declaration but did not specify 
in the memorials introduction what that declaration would involve 
elements of the introduction were obtained by the associated 
press 
iran filed the case in may 1989 and the bush administration 
said it would take part in the proceedings washington has until 
march 4 to file its corresponding memorial 
the court the judicial arm of the un has no enforcement 
powers and depends on the voluntary adherence of states coming 
before it 
irans memorial was intended to prove that the court has 
jurisdiction over the case and to state the facts of its claim 
the memorial said america refused to accept responsibility for 
the airbus downing and continued to provoke iran by its naval 
presence in the gulf 
it also wants the council of the international civil aviation 
organization to reverse a november 1988 refusal to condemn 
washington for the incident 
iran said the united states violated iranian sovereignty as well 
as un charter provisions barring the use of force and assuring 
freedom of navigation 
besides iranians the plane carried passengers from india 
italy kuwait pakistan yugoslavia and united arab emirates 
thenpresident reagan announced an offer of compensation to 
victims families eight days after the incident 
the compensation process for noniranian victims began in 1989 
250000 to the families of wageearners 100000 to the families 
of other victims 
iran insisted on being compensated directly for the downing and 
refused to provide a list of eligible next of kin 
irans compensation demands include for life lost mental 
suffering the loss of the plane itself and the cost of search and 
rescue operations 
the world court case is likely to be handled by the us and 
iranian officials representing their governments at the iranunited 
states claims tribunal in the hague

a major television network claimed new allies 
tuesday in the networks fight to change tv syndication rules while 
a motion picture industry leader accused nbc cbs and nbc of trying 
to stifle competition 
nbc told the federal communications commission that the 
millionmember national education association and the advocacy 
group action for childrens television no longer support the 
existing syndication rules and that several other groups support 
the network position 
at issue is whether the three major networks should be given the 
right to invest in shows they air and then reap the benefits of 
both foreign and domestic syndication or redistribution as movies 
or videotapes 
an fcc rule in effect since 1970 bars the networks from having a 
financial interest in shows they dont wholly own and bars them 
from syndicating even their own shows in the united states 
opponents say the financial interest and syndication rule 
discourages the major networks from taking risks to develop 
innovative programs proponents of the rule say it prevents the 
networks from dominating primetime television 
the movie industry and the major networks failed to resolve the 
issue after several years of negotiations and the fcc has said it 
will decide whether to rescind the rules after taking final 
comments aug 1 
nbc in a statement filed with the commission said groups with 
a combined membership of about 20 million people support a repeal 
of the rule they include hundreds of local television stations 
labor unions teachers organizations and senior citizen and other 
consumer groups the network said 
most do not have any economic stake in the outcome of this 
rulemaking proceeding but recognize the value of maintaining a 
free and diverse television program service nbc said in its 
statement signed by general counsel richard cotton 
in an interview cotton said the industry has changed 
considerably since the 1970s when the three major networks 
commanded 90 percent of the primetime audience a recent survey 
showed audiences for nbc abc and cbs totalling 52 percent he said 
he said 60 percent of us homes now have cable television with 
an average of 30 stations per household compared to seven in 1970s 
he said networks purchase only 21 percent of programs compared with 
75 percent in 1970 
the network was responding to an assertion by jack valenti 
president of the motion picture association of america that only 
the networks support repeal of the rule 
valenti said in a speech tuesday the public would be illserved 
when a few people accumulate lifeanddeath authority over what 
americans see on primetime television 
he said the rules serves as a check on network abuse of power 
the rule valenti said has restored competition to a program 
arena previously barren to competition and it has allowed 
independent television stations to grow and prosper

marlon brandos son was ordered tuesday to 
stand trial for murder in the shooting of his sisters lover after 
a prosecutor quoted christian brando as saying of the victim 
death is too good for the guy 
municipal judge larry fidler set bail at 10 million saying 
that was the only way to ensure he wouldnt flee 
a spokeswoman for the district attorney said the amount may be 
the highest ever set by a los angeles county judge 
marlon brando had offered to put up his house worth more than 
5 million to guarantee his sons return the prosecution had 
sought no bail 
defense attorney robert shapiro indicated the brando family 
would post bail but declined to say when or how it would be posted 
ive talked to christians father brother and family theyre 
anxiously awaiting his return home 
marlon brando was hurriedly led out of a back door of the 
courtroom after making some notes on the judges decision 
the judge who listened to two days of testimony about the 
killing of dag drollet said he had to decide whether christian 
brando committed murder rather than manslaughter the charge the 
defense had sought 
it would appear to me from the evidence presented that the 
district attorney has certainly met the burden of proof fidler 
said there has been a killing and the defendant pulled the 
trigger 
a superior court arraignment was set for aug 7 
deputy district attorney steven barshop read the judge a 
statement the younger brando made to the first police officer who 
arrived at his fathers mulholland drive estate after the shooting 
may 16 
i shot him man but not on purpose he quoted brando as 
saying it was an accident the gun was under the couch i kept 
it there 
barshop quoted him as saying i did it because he hurt my 
sister my sister is pregnanthe was fighting with my sister 
later in the statement brando conceded that he disliked drollet 
and declared man death is too good for the guy 
christian brando told police the gun went off during a fight 
but prosecutors contend there wasnt any evidence of a struggle 
they said paramedics found drollet on a couch with a cigarette 
lighter in one hand and a television remote control in the other 
moments before the hearing ended laurene landon coughlin a 
former girlfriend of christian brando testified that the 
32yearold defendant came to her apartment shortly before the 
shooting and appeared to be intoxicated 
defense attorney shapiro told the court earlier that marlon 
brando planned to make a shrine to drollet in the room where he was 
killed that could explain why the elder brando resisted police 
efforts to return to the scene weeks later to reconstruct the 
crime shapiro said 
the whitehaired portly actor who sat in a front row of the 
courtroom for a second day closed his eyes and extended his hands 
at one point as if meditating 
across the courtroom drollets mother wept as a firearms expert 
described the face wound that killed her son 
the expert david butler of the los angeles police department 
said that drollet was shot under his left eye at such close range 
that minute particles of tissue were left on the muzzle of the 
45caliber semiautomatic pistol 
also at tuesdays hearing fidler refused to admit into evidence 
a statement from christian brandos sister cheyenne brando that 
was taken before she left for tahiti she reportedly told police 
she considered the killing of her boyfriend murder not an accident 
barshop said he hopes to coax miss brando into returning from 
tahiti to testify at christians trial

iraq accused neighboring kuwait on tuesday of 
conspiring to harm its economy and massed tens of thousands of 
troops and hundreds of tanks on the border 
informed sources in kuwait said the iraqi troop buildup had 
increased over the last 48 hours to at least 30000 and that more 
than 200 sovietmade tanks were posted along iraqs 100milelong 
southern border with kuwait 
the area of the troop buildup is rich in oil reserves and has 
been a source of contention since kuwait gained its independence 
from britain in 1961 the border demarcation has never been agreed 
on by iraq and a portion of it crosses the rumaila oil field 
the same sources said kuwait on tuesday reinstated its state of 
alert declared july 16 and canceled after three days of tension 
between the two oilproducing countries iraq has 17 million 
residents including 1 million troops kuwait was 18 million 
residents and 20300 members of the armed forces 
the us defense department meanwhile announced that us navy 
warships and aircraft were holding a shortnotice exercise in 
the persian gulf with the united arab emirates about 600 miles 
south of the kuwaitiraq dispute 
the united states has at least seven warships in the gulf at any 
given moment the state department announced at the beginning of 
the crisis that it backs kuwaits territorial integrity 
iraq has accused kuwait of being an american puppet and of 
conspiring with the united states to throttle the economy of iraq 
which has the worlds secondlargest oil reserves but endured a 
costly war from 198088 with iran 
in washington us state department spokeswoman margaret d 
tutwiler said both iraq and kuwait had strengthened their armed 
forces 
iraq and others know there is no place for coercion in a 
civilized world she said all disputes should be handled 
through peaceful means 
egyptian president hosni mubarak flew to baghdad and kuwait on 
tuesday to meet with mediate the crises with leaders of those 
countries mubarak said his mission was successful but iraq 
downplayed his efforts 
iraqi president saddam hussein claims his country lost 14 
billion during the past year because of a world oil glut that has 
sent crude prices tumbling he has accused kuwait and the united 
arab emirates of overproduction 
in a long letter tuesday to the arab league iraqi foreign 
minister tareq aziz charged kuwait with stealing iraqi oil from the 
rumaila field which he said was entirely owned by iraq the field 
extends two miles into kuwait 
many observers said they believe saddam who has spent an 
estimated 50 billion on sophisticated arms since coming to power 
in 1979 is engaging in saberrattling to back his demands for 
lower oil production and higher prices 
iraq has said it will push for a 7 increase in oil prices at 
the wednesday meeting of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries in geneva 
the 13member group is to set production and prices for the rest 
of the year 
tuesday iraqs government newspaper aljoumhouriya accused 
kuwait of coordinating its moves with the united states in order to 
clear the way for foreign powers to intervene in the area 
it also accused kuwait of ignoring arab solidarity by demanding 
the repayment of loans made to support iraq during the iraniraq 
war 
kuwait loaned iraq an estimated 15 billion during the war iraq 
owes foreign creditors about 70 billion 
reports of the troop buildup sent jitters through world 
financial markets 
in tokyo the dollar strengthened against the japanese yen over 
news of increasing unrest in the gulf 
missiles armored personel carriers and tanks were prominently 
displayed along the road from iraq to kuwait as travelers poured 
back to the gulf state when the dispute erupted iraq was a popular 
vacation destination for kuwaitis 
diplomats said the buildup has escalated since monday when the 
washington post quoted sources in washington as saying two 
divisions of the elite republican guards corps were moved to the 
border 
the diplomats and informed sources in the gulf on tuesday put 
the number of iraq troops at 30000 on the southern border nearly 
50 percent more than the number of armed forces in kuwait 
in washington pete williams a defense department spokesman 
told reporters that the joint usemirates exercise codenamed 
ivory justice began monday and that two us navy vessels left 
from their port at bahrain to participate 
he declined to comment on the purpose of the maneuvers 
the official kuwait news agency quoted mubarak as describing his 
talks with iraqi and kuwaiti leaders as successful 
but aziz told the official iraqi news agency with due respect 
to our arab brothers it has never happened in the past that such 
disputes were solved by arab mediation committees 
shortly after kuwait gained its independendence iraq claimed 
sovereignty and the kuwaitis called on britain for assistance 
britain sent in paratroopers and they were replaced by an arab 
force led by egypt which acted as a buffer between the two 
countries until tensions eased in 1963 
kuwait suffered itself during the gulf war when iran attacked 
kuwaiti shipping lanes fired missiles on the coast and was held 
responsible for acts of terrorism that included an attempt on the 
life of the emir of kuwait in 1985

oileating bacteria are breaking down 
the mess left by the exxon valdez spill in prince william sound and 
should be used on other spills the nations top environmental 
official said 
william k reilly chief of the environmental protection agency 
said monday that such bioremediation efforts should continue on 
shores fouled by the exxon valdez spill even if that means a third 
summer of cleanup 
state and coast guard officials disagree over how long manual 
and mechanical methods like flushing and tilling should accompany 
bioremediation in the bioremediation method used here chemical 
fertilizers that promote the growth of oileating bacteria were 
spread on sullied beaches 
theres no question that we have made progress toward cleanup 
that is notable significant and very encouraging reilly told 
reporters after his shoreline tour with alaska environmental 
commissioner dennis kelso 
it was reillys first visit to prince william sound since late 
last summer and his third since the tanker exxon valdez ran 
aground in march 1989 spewing nearly 11 million gallons of crude 
oil in the nations biggest oil spill 
the success of bioremediation here bodes well for other oil 
spills and for sites nationwide that have been polluted by leaking 
underground storage tanks reilly said 
i would very much hope that bioremediation comes on in a big 
way throughout the united states reilly said we are 
developing an intimate familiarity with oil spills and we 
desperately need new technologies 
some environmentalists opposed spreading the phosphorous and 
nitrogenbased fertilizers on the shoreline fearing they might 
wreak havoc on an environment already battered by the massive spill 
however no major adverse effects have been reported since the 
fertilizers were spread earlier this summer officials said 
in june natural oileating microbes were used to clean up a 
light crude oil spill off galveston texas the successful effort 
marked the first time bioremediation was used in open waters 
meanwhile state and coast guard officials are arguing about how 
long the cleanup should continue in alaska and who is authorized to 
end it 
kelso has said work should continue anywhere there are more than 
5 grams of oil per kilogram of beach material thats than 
onetenth of an ounce of oil per pound of rocks or sand the shores 
should be clean enough not only for wildlife habitation but also 
for recreational use he said 
but coast guard rear admiral david ciancaglini the federal 
onscene coordinator said the cleanup should stop before it 
intrudes on the natural recovering habitat 
reilly said another summer cleanup would be warranted if a 
subsurface problem of any size remains next spring 
officials from exxon corp which is funding the cleanup have 
said they believe the effort can be completed this summer

when david souter was attorney general new 
hampshire lost in the us supreme court one of its most widely 
followed court cases brought against a couple for covering the 
live free or die motto on their license plates 
george and maxine maynard taped over the motto in 1975 citing 
religious objections they were jehovahs witnesses and said they 
didnt believe that freedom is more important than life 
their plates were taken away and after refusing to pay a fine 
george maynard spent 15 days in jail 
sen warren rudman rnh was attorney general at the time 
a threejudge federal panel upheld the maynards right to 
obliterate the motto but flamboyant gov meldrim thomson vowed to 
fight them all the way to the us supreme court and ordered 
souter who succeeded rudman to proceed with the appeal 
souter said he did not see the states action as infringing on 
the maynards right to free speech 
this was not an articulated statement of words it was an 
act he said 
the high court didnt see it that way and ruled in 1977 that 
states may not force their residents to display mottoes or other 
ideological messages on license plates or other personal property 
the first amendment protects the right of individuals to hold 
points of view different from the majority and to refuse to foster 
in the way new hampshire commands an idea they find morally 
objectionable the court wrote 
souter said he was not surprised 
we realized this was a difficult case since the law clearly 
didnt favor us he said 
eight months after the high court ruled the maynards still were 
trying to collect 21000 in legal fees from the state so a us 
marshal armed with a warrant went to a busy stateowned liquor 
store and ordered the manager to hand over the money the manager 
called the governor who promised payment and the money came 
through two weeks later

salvadoran government and guerrilla 
negotiators skipped ahead to a discussion of human rights on 
tuesday in an effort to salvage some accord from a crucial round of 
peace talks in san jose 
the talks had bogged down on the subject of overhaul of the 
armed forces 
the costa rican session began last friday it is seen as vital 
to maintaining momentum toward a negotiated end to el salvadors 
10yearold civil war which has killed an estimated 72000 people 
the salvadoran military meanwhile announced that a judiciary 
official was assassinated by rebels and five guerrillas were killed 
and four soldiers wounded in renewed fighting tuesday in el 
salvador 
senior guerrilla commander schafik handal told journalists in 
this costa rican capital that rebel delegates agreed to move on to 
discuss human rights second item on the agenda in an effort to 
save the negotiations 
there is still time to reach accords he said 
the farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln has said 
lack of progress at this round would make a major insurgent 
offensive likely high authorities of the government of president 
alfredo cristiani have said a big rebel push could scrap the talks 
justice minister oscar santamaria the chief government 
delegate termed surrealist on tuesday rebel demands for 
demilitarization of el salvador 
handal characterized the government response to rebel proposals 
for military overhaul as irresponsible not serious he said 
the government position amounted to provocation 
the session here due to end wednesday follows negotiations in 
venezuela in may and mexico in june the first round of 
unmediated talks produced an agenda with the future role of the 
armed forces as lead item 
five days of talks in mexico on the military and four days here 
produced no accord the rebels said the government position 
presented since friday in some aspects represented a step 
backward from mexico 
the fmln demands a purge of the officer corps to rid it of 
those it sees as flagrant abusers of human rights an end to 
military impunity creation of a civiliancontrolled police force 
to replace the current militarized police eradication of 
militarylinked death squads dissolution of paramilitary forces 
and an end to forced conscription 
the government proposed strengthening of existing mechanisms 
designed to permit the military to police itself and creation of 
new ones it said it would dissolve paramilitary civil defense 
forces once the fmln was demobilized 
handal said the armed forces issue is still the crucial 
subject and remains to be resolved 
some type of accord on human rights appeared possible 
international human rights groups have blamed the salvadoran 
armed forces and militarylinked death squads in the deaths of 
about 30000 suspected leftists in the past decade no officer has 
been convicted or even tried in connection with a rights abuse 
crime 
guerrilla sources said the rebels will propose establishing a 
human rights office under a special prosecutor the office would be 
subject to international supervision negotiators would work out 
the particulars 
santamaria told journalists tuesday the government is willing 
to accept international vigilance over the human rights process 
an armed forces news release in san salvador said troops killed 
five guerrillas in a fire fight near zafra 112 miles east of the 
capital and four soldiers were wounded in a clash near cinquera 
42 miles east of san salvador 
guerrillas on monday night killed jose heriberto rubio a 
justice of the peace in nueva esparta 124 miles east of san

the federal racketeering and gambling trial 
of new orleans district attorney a former federal attorney a 
television actor and others went to a jury tuesday 
jurors will begin deliberations wednesday 
at the heart of the sixweek trial was the allegation that 
district attorney harry connick illegally returned seized gambling 
records to known bookmaker walton aucoin so aucoin could pay off 
and collect gambling debts 
on trial with connick are actor paul burke and former assistant 
us attorney patrick fanning aucoin also is a codefendant along 
with two of his alleged employees steve bertolino and william g 
condon of metairie and new orleans businessman wilson abraham 
connick 63 is the father of grammywinning jazz musician harry 
connick jr he has been district attorney in new orleans since 1973 
burke once starred in televisions the naked city and played 
a congressman on dynasty and had guest roles on numerous other 
series 
prosecutors led by james cole of the justice department in 
washington made much of the fact that connick ordered the return 
of aucoins records just five days after aucoin was arrested on 
dec 4 1988 the records were returned before connicks office 
accepted the case for prosecution prosecutors said 
defense lawyers who delivered their final arguments earlier 
tuesday have maintained connick simply gave aucoin something he 
was entitled to as a suspect in a crime and as a man who planned to 
pay federal taxes on his gambling income 
the crime in this case exists solely in the minds of the 
prosecutors defense attorney william wessell said in his closing 
argument 
the trial began june 11 the indictment was returned last 
december after a yearlong investigation begun by us attorney 
john volz 
connick and volz had been at odds for years over various issues 
and volz later turned the case over to the justice department 
saying he wanted to avoid any appearance of bias or conflict 
nevertheless connick blamed volz when the indictment was handed 
down and accused him of carrying out a political vendetta 
aucoin bertolino and condon were accused of running an illegal 
gambling operation fanning burke and abraham were accused of 
helping cook up phony reasons for connick to return records to the 
bookie that is that aucoin had to have them to pay taxes on his 
bookmaking income 
fanning once an assistant to volz was aucoins lawyer at the 
time burke was an acquaintance of connick and aucoin as was 
abraham a contributor to connicks political campaigns 
the specific charges against the defendants were listed in the 
indictment as conducting the affairs of an enterprise through the 
collection of unlawful debt and conducting an illegal gambling 
business burke also was charged with lying to the grand jury 
connick faced a possible maximum sentence of 25 years in prison 
and a 500000 fine burke with the added perjury charge faced up 
to 30 years and 750000 in fines 
the investigation also involved former louisiana gov edwin 
edwards and a suburban sheriff harry lee of jefferson parish 
although neither man was indicted lee testified that he once 
returned gambling records to aucoin after an arrest and edwards was 
widely reported to have called lee on aucoins behalf to urge 
return of those records

a study casts new doubt on federal reports that 
list hospital death rates and fuels concern that the reports are a 
poor measure of hospital quality a researcher said tuesday 
researchers for the rand corp found that varying death rates 
among two types of heart patients could be attributed to random 
statistical variations rather than the treatment the patients 
received 
their report is published in wednesdays journal of the american 
medical association it follows by six months a study published in 
the same journal that criticized the government for inadequately 
examining how the severity of illness may affect hospital death 
rates 
the new study didnt test the most recent method used by the 
health care financing administration to compare mortality rates 
among medicare patients at the nations nearly 6000 hospitals 
but the rand study still urges caution in analyzing the yearly 
reports by the health care administration which adminsters the 
medicare program said rolla edward park principal author 
i think what it points toward is the need to continue to try 
to improve the hcfa methods to figure out what kind of information 
can be put into consumers hands that is the most useful park 
said 
officials at the hcfa which funded part of the rand study said 
they would consider the study in a continuing effort to improve 
their reporting but they said the rand approach to death rates is 
not comparable to theirs 
reports titled medicare hospital mortality information have 
been issued publicly for the past three years by the hcfa an arm 
of the department of health and human services the reports use 
statistical techniques to compare predicted hospital mortality 
rates with the actual number of deaths 
federal officials each year have warned against using the 
reports as the sole measure of a hospitals quality 
rands fourstate study looked at a sample of 2276 deaths among 
medicare patients at 734 hospitals congestive heart failure in 
which the hearts gradual loss of strength causes the lungs to fill 
with fluid accounted for 1126 deaths and heart attacks accounted 
for 1150 
when analyzing the quality of care researchers found some 
hospitals with higherthanexpected death rates called 
targeted hospitals actually provided better care than 
nontargeted hospitals 
researchers found that targeted hospitals treated more serious 
heart attack cases and therefore could reasonably expect higher 
death rates 
no statistical difference was found in the severity of illness 
among patients with congestive heart failure the researchers said 
the researchers used a computer model to measure how much of the 
difference in death rates could be attributed to random variations 
the figures from the simulation roughly matched the actual 
difference in death rates between the targeted and nontargeted 
hospitals the researchers said 
the rand corp is a private nonprofit organization researches 
and analyzes us security and domestic policy

gov mario cuomo signed legislation tuesday 
banning dwarf tossing and dwarf bowling in new york bars calling 
the activities a strange diversion 
any activity which dehumanizes and humiliates these people is 
degrading to us all cuomo said this bill recognizes that and 
in effect declares these bizarre games to be debased 
the bill similar to one that became law in florida last year 
amounts to a ban because the events have not been popular outside 
bars it passed the legislature with only one dissenting vote 
the law targets taverns but has no penalties for participants 
bars could loose their liquor licenses 
dwarf tossing is a competition in which people pick up dwarfs 
who are wearing harnesses and heave them as far as possible at a 
padded target it produced an offshoot dwarf bowling in which a 
helmeted dwarf is strapped to a skateboard and rolled into bowling 
pins both have been held as competitions for cash prizes cuomo 
said 
a new york city area promoter said the law amounts to censorship 
baird jones said his dwarf events are performance art designed 
to satirize the values of mainstream america 
because were doing this where alcohol is being served were 
being lumped with bar sports jones said this is not someone 
promoting wrestling in jello between naked women 
the games originated in australia and made their way to the 
united states about five years ago 
dwarf tossing belongs in the middle ages not the modern 
age said state sen nicholas spano who sponsored the bill 
the legislation had been pushed by the little people of america 
an organization founded in 1957 by actor billy barty 
in his approval message tuesday cuomo said he was swayed by 
arguments from dwarf advocates that the games only perpetuate the 
outdated images of dwarfs as court jesters or circus freaks and 
posed medical dangers supporters of the bill had maintained that 
dwarfs have brittle bones 
cuomo said he was also sensitive to arguments voiced recently 
by syndicated columnist mike royko that government has no 
business meddling in the rights of a consenting adult dwarf to be 
tossed or bowled 
this state does not lightly impose limits on the activities of 
consenting participants cuomo said but balancing all the 
interests affected i am persuaded that approval of this bill 
respects human dignity and protects the safety and self respect of 
the special people who are the subject of this strange diversion 
the legislation may be largely symbolic officials at little 
people of america say dwarf tossing has virtually stopped killed 
at least in part by negative publicity 
heidi heinrich of tallahassee fla who has been a national 
leader in the fight against dwarf tossing has said she was aware 
of only one exhibition of the game in recent months that was in 
south carolina and took place while that states legislature was 
considering a bill to outlaw the practice the bill was defeated

a proposed 180 million budget for the 
embattled national endowment for the arts including a 900000 
increase in federal funds for state arts agencies was approved 
tuesday by a house appropriations subcommittee 
the bill was sent to the full house appropriations committee by 
voice vote without action on any antiobscenity amendments that 
would restrict the kinds of art eligible for taxpaid endowment 
grants 
a major house floor fight had been expected to begin friday on 
separate legislation that would extend the neas life for another 
five years but late in the day tuesday jeff biggs press aide to 
speaker thomas s foley dwash said that debate had been 
postponed until after the august recess because more than 20 
amendments needed to be considered 
republicans are drafting proposals for a drastic overhaul of the 
endowment as a result of past financial support for art that 
conservatives have denounced as obscene or sacrilegious 
the appropriations bill approved by the subcommittee tuesday 
would provide a 5 percent increase in the nea budget from 1713 
million to 180 million in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
at the urging of rep sidney yates dill the subcommittee 
chairman and a staunch arts advocate the panel approved boosting 
endowment funds for states arts councils from 261 million to 27 
million 
increases for dance music opera and musical theater the media 
arts and design arts also were approved 
a major proposal of the house republican plan to restructure the 
arts endowment would funnel 60 percent of nea grant money to the 
states compared with the current level of 20 percent 
the gop measure drafted chiefly by reps tom coleman of 
missouri and steve gunderson of wisconsin also would require the 
nea chairman to assure congress that federally supported art is 
sensitive to the nature of public sponsorship and to the cultural 
heritage of the united states its religious traditions or racial 
or ethnic groups and does not violate prevailing standards of 
obscenity 
the obscenity provision is the most controversial feature of the 
colemangunderson plan which will be submitted when the house 
begins debate on the neas reauthorization bill later this week 
the endowment is an independent federal agency that underwrites 
a wide variety of artists and arts institutions with taxpaid 
grants requiring matching funds from private sources 
for more than a year the nea has been the focus of a growing 
political controversy over its previous support for exhibitions of 
sexually explicit works by the late photographer robert 
mapplethorpe and artist andres serrano 
under pressure from sen jesse helms rnc and other 
conservative legislators and from religious fundamentalists 
congress voted last fall to prohibit the nea from supporting 
artwork that may be considered obscene including depictions of 
sex acts sadomasochism homoeroticism or sexual exploitation of 
children 
the colemangunderson antiobscenity provision is based on the 
supreme courts 1973 definition of obscenity which covers works 
that appeal to prurient interest portray patently offensive sexual 
conduct and lack serious artistic scientific political or 
literary value based on community standards 
the republican bill would allow the endowment to recover grant 
funds if the nea chairman concluded that a recipients work 
violated the supreme court standards on obscenity the recipient 
could appeal in federal court

a man went on trial tuesday for allegedly inciting 
antisemitism in a violent protest that galvanized fears of pogroms 
among soviet jews and prompted some to flee 
konstantin smirnovostashvili denied being antisemitic but in 
a conversation with reporters from the dock charged that jews 
wielded a disproportionate share of power 
a russian person is brought to trial in the center of russia 
for insulting injuring the dignity and for instigating 
intolerance against those who enjoy massive privileges and who 
hold the leading posts in our society he said 
he said he faced charges that could bring him up to five years 
in prison because of a campaign by the soviet press that belongs 
to the left the democrats the zionists i think its all the 
same 
smirnovostashvili was apparently the first person charged under 
a strengthened law prohibiting ethnic insults or appeals for 
ethnic intolerance 
he was arrested for allegedly being one of the organizers of a 
jan 18 protest the protesters broke up a meeting of writers at 
moscows central house of literature and roughed up some of the 
participants 
judge ai muratov postponed the trial in the moscow city court 
for a day before smirnovostashvili could enter a plea because of a 
crush of reporters surrounding the dock and a raucous crowd of 
several hundred people some of those present applauded the 
defendants statements and shouted shame when muratov denied 
his motion to dismiss his attorney 
more than 71000 jews emigrated from the soviet union as travel 
laws were eased last year and thousands more have left this year 
jewish leaders have cited an unprecedented panic among the 
jewish population in the face of threats from extreme russian 
nationalist groups such as the pamyat society such groups accuse 
the countrys 14 million jews of dragging russia down into a 
morass of soviet socialism 
one jew who attended the trial said it would test the soviet 
court system which historically has been viewed as little more 
than an arm of the communist authorities 
i am going to find out how just soviet justice is how much we 
are going to be protected said the 36yearold psychiatrist who 
identified himself only as eduard 
he said he also would learn how strong smirnovostashvilis 
supporters are 
the case has received wide publicity in the soviet press and 
served to highten jews fears of antisemitic attacks 
the popular weekly ogonyok quoted demonstrators as saying 
through a megaphone at the jan 18 meeting 
your time is over neither the police nor the kgb nor the 
party will help you now we will be the masters of the country and 
you newcomers clear out and go to israel how long can we 
tolerate your russophobia 
in a rare preview the government newspaper izvestia published a 
short report announcing the trial last week on sunday the 
communist party daily pravda printed an editorial urging the 
country to come to grips with its history of antisemitism 
s rogov a historian wrote in pravda that it would be at 
minimum stupid to pretend there is no problem many jews do not 
want to emigrate he said but their fear of the specter of 
pogroms is beginning to grow into a panic 
in another development a jewish parliamentarian demanded monday 
that russian writer valentin rasputin resign from mikhail s 
gorbachevs presidential council for alleged antisemitic 
statements 
smirnovostashvili 64 was brought to trial after a fivemonth 
investigation in which more than 400 people were questioned 
he said that if muratov and two civilian assistants tried him on 
a strictly legal basis he likely would be given a heavy sentence 
but if they consider the polarization in the country they should 
not punish him severely because that would worsen the political 
tension he said 
smirnovostashvili said he could not be considered antisemitic 
nowhere in any of my declarations was there an insult to jews 
as a nation he said i have spoken all the time about 
zionists 
he also showed reporters an award from the soviet government for 
giving blood and said that also proved he was not a racist 
how can you be an honored donor of the soviet union having 
given 30 liters of blood to our medicine not knowing where it is 
going to georgian children to jewish children to russian 
children how can an honored donor be an antisemite he asked

sixteen people were charged tuesday with 
participating in a scheme to rob homes and businesses of jewelry 
rare coins and precious gems and then resell the merchandise in 
manhattans diamond district 
two men who owned several businesses in the district were 
identified as the leaders of the fencing ring which authorities 
said was in operation since 1982 
james m fox assistant director of the fbis new york office 
said the participants would use every opportunity to commit a 
robbery 
some were blatant armed robberies in broad daylight on the 
streets of manhattan other times they cased out residences or 
businesses and would go in covertly fox said at a news 
conference with us attorney otto obermaier 
fox said it was not uncommon for jewelry to be reset and 
displayed in one of the ringleaders stores as quickly as two hours 
after it was stolen 
although court papers said the defendants netted 12 million 
fox said the amount could be much higher because the scheme had 
been going on for so long 
court papers listed a series of robberies of homes and 
businesses in new jersey from 1983 to 1985 the theft of 221000 
worth of jewelry from a greek exporting company in 1987 and 10 
rolex watches from a foreign shipment in 1986 and the armed 
robbery of a north palm beach fla home in 1983 that netted 
60000 worth of jewelry and merchandise 
fox and obermaier released three separate indictments arising 
from the fencing scheme one charged the two store owners felix 
friedman and lawrence tinnirello and seven others with 
racketeering and various fraud counts 
friedman and tinnirello operated as many as 13 stores some of 
which are still in business in the diamond district located on 
47th street between fifth and sixth avenues authorities said 
the racketeering indictment also outlined a scheme in which the 
defendants allegedly obtained jewelry from other merchants on 
consignment and then kept the items without paying the owner 
friedman who was described by a prosecutor as the business 
brains behind the fence people was ordered held without bail by 
us magistrate naomi buchwald she found he was likely to threaten 
witnesses if released 
tinnirello was held overnight pending a further bail hearing 
wednesday assistant us attorney james comey said both had been 
involved in acts of violence 
four other men were charged with robbery conspiracy in 
connection with the robbery of a brooklyn jewelry store last year 
and a fifth was accused of fraud in the consignment scheme 
a third indictment charged the wives of the store owners irina 
zaritskaya and mindy tinnirello with making false statements to 
banks in order to hide the profits of the fencing scheme they each 
face up to five years in prison on one count of making false 
statements to banks they were released on their own recognizance

keystone camera products corp claiming to be 
the last american maker of conventional fixedfocus cameras lost 
its bid tuesday for trade relief from imports 
the four us international trade commission members voted 
unanimously against granting the import quotas and higher tariffs 
the clifton nj firm sought 
imports of cameras were not a substantial cause of injury to 
the domestic camera industry the commission members found 
keystone which made 25 million cameras last year claims it is 
the sole remaining american manufacturer of conventional 35mm fixed 
focus and pointandshoot cameras and pocket cameras in the popular 
110 film size 
its petition excluded imported disc singlelens reflex instant 
print and 110 cameras with variable focus 
keystone contended that imports from japan china taiwan hong 
kong mexico south korea thailand and brazil have hurt the 
domestic camera industry and could jeopardize the future of 500 
manufacturing and distribution jobs 
the company said that imports of the types of cameras it 
produces increased from 11 million in 1985 to 275 million in 1987 
earlier chairman myron j berman had said that without import 
restrictions keystone would be forced to move production overseas 
as other camera makers have done he said keystone already had cut 
costs to the bone 
keystone could pursue alternate appeals for help such as 
charging that foreign cameras have been dumped in the american 
marketplace at less than fairmarket value said betsy godley a 
spokesman for the trade panel 
photography giant eastman kodak co of rochester ny which 
said it was not being hurt by imports had asked the trade 
commission to deny relief to keystone 
kodak which operates around the world argued that keystone was 
responsible for its own market troubles because of poor management 
decisions 
kodak also had disputed keystones claim to be the last bona 
fide american camera maker

joseph hazelwood who was acquitted 
four months ago of most criminal charges in the nations worst oil 
spill faces a coast guard hearing that could strip him of his 
license as a ships master 
in a hearing scheduled to start wednesday an administrative law 
judge will decide whether the former exxon valdez skipper was 
guilty of negligence and should forfeit his license 
the judge harry j gardner has a number of options in deciding 
the case according to the coast guard and hazelwoods lawyers he 
could choose to dismiss all charges revoke hazelwoods license or 
place him on probation 
he cannot impose a fine or prison term 
hazelwood is accused of breaking a coast guard rule by drinking 
within four hours of assuming command of his ship and leaving the 
ships bridge while the tanker was traveling through icy waters he 
also is accused of leaving a crewman who lacked a required license 
in control of the bridge 
hazelwoods attorney michael chalos said the defense would 
argue that hazelwood wasnt responsible for the ships running into 
a reef 
the exxon valdez was en route from the alaskan port of valdez to 
long beach on march 24 1989 when it struck a charted reef gashed 
by jagged rocks the 987foot tanker spilled 11 million gallons of 
alaska crude oil into prince william sound 
capt hazelwood looks forward to putting on his case and being 
vindicated much as he has been in alaska chalos said hes 
been spending most of his time helping us prepare for this 
hearing 
the defense will argue that any drinking within four hours of 
sailing was unintentional because the ship left port an hour 
earlier than it was supposed to 
the defense also plans to argue that the coast guard itself had 
waived its requirement that the person in control of the bridge 
have a pilots license for prince william sound and that the coast 
guard failed to adequately monitor the exxon valdez via radar 
hazelwood was acquitted at his twomonth trial of being drunk 
and reckless but was convicted of one misdemeanor charge of 
negligent discharge of oil he was ordered to pay 50000 
restitution and spend 1000 hours cleaning beaches at prince 
william sound he is appealing the verdict 
an administrative hearing resembles a trial but is held without 
a jury before an administrative law judge the hearing could last 
anywhere from a day to weeks 
the hearing is being held in long beach because it is the 
headquarters for the 11th coast guard district which includes 
alaska

president bush launched the public campaign for 
his supreme court nomination of judge david h souter tuesday as he 
urged the senate to avoid any ideological litmus test in the 
confirmation process 
in speeches to republican fundraising events in philadelphia 
and new york bush lavished praise on the man he picked monday to 
serve on the supreme court 
i look forward to the senate hearings of david souter i am 
sure they will find him to be tough but fair the president said 
in a speech on behalf of new york gop candidates at the 
waldorfastoria hotel 
hes a firstrate appellate judge an outstanding jurist and a 
great legal mind 
before his speech in new york bush met for 25 minutes with 
former president ford deputy white house press secretary stephen 
hart said hart said the president invited ford to his room after 
learning that the former president was at the hotel he did not say 
what they talked about 
the supreme court must be guided by independent minds and its 
members are appointed for life largely to keep them above the 
flames of political passion bush said in philadelphia 
so in my nomination of judge david souter for senate 
confirmation there was no single issue no litmus test or 
standard dominating my decision 
and i will add there should be no litmus test in the process 
of confirmation bush said 
his statements drew applause from a crowd of about 500 at a 
fundraising luncheon for pennsylvania republicans 
later bush visited a neighborhood drug prevention center and 
declared no crack in philadelphia except for the one in the 
liberty bell 
he pushed for swift action on an administrationbacked crime 
bill that he said would provide strong new tools to fight this 
war on drugs 
bush said on monday he would nominate souter a former new 
hampshire supreme court justice recently named to the 1st us 
circuit court of appeals to succeed retiring justice william j 
brennan 
souter is widely expected to be questioned in confirmation 
hearings before the democraticdominated senate judiciary 
committee about his views on the issue of abortion 
both abortion rights supporters and opponents were among a 
variety of demonstrators carrying placards and chanting outside the 
hotel where bush spoke 
some members of the radical act up aids coalition to unleash 
power hurled fake dollar bills from a window and nine others 
managed to evade security and stage a sitdown in the hall outside 
the ballroom where the dinner was held still others staged die 
ins in the lobby dousing themselves with fake blood 
police said they arrested 37 people 
my sole priority was to appoint a justice true to the life and 
spirit of the constitution the president said a priority that 
i am confident will also guide the congress in the confirmation 
process 
i believe i am recommending an individual with a strong 
incisive independent devotion to interpreting the constitution a 
quiet man of enormous intellectual strength a tough trial court 
judge with a great legal mind and an impartial quality that will 
serve the court well said bush 
i firmly believe that he will be a great justice he said 
in washington souter met at the white house with frederick d 
mcclure the presidents chief of congressional liaison for a 
briefing on the confirmation process 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the nomination would 
be officially sent to the senate on wednesday and souter would then 
begin visiting with senate leaders and members of the judiciary 
committee 
in philadelphia while bush was making his introductory remarks 
a protester arose and accused him of being a liar 
the crowd booed and bush quipped i havent even said anything 
yet and im lying 
these people feel strongly he said let them have their 
say and then a little politeness should prevail and the guy thats 
up here speaking ought to be given his day in court 
the protester apparently was upset about us policy in el 
salvador 
bush also discussed deficitreduction talks saying the 
congress and i are working hard to put americas fiscal house in 
order to put the spending policies that brought us to this point 
behind us 
in washington democrats involved in the negotiations appealed 
to the president to tone down criticism of democratic policies in 
the interest of seeking an agreement fitzwater said bush would be 
very gentle 
still in new york bush complained of democratic dominance 
which he said has caused government by gridlock with spending 
skyrocketing out of control good legislation thrown aside for pork 
and a budget deficit looming over our childrens children 
he ended on a slightly kinder note taking note of his daily 
meetings with the leaders of congress saying i think they are 
trying to reach an agreement

the government said tuesday that 
communist party candidates routed most of the opposition in the 
primary round of mongolias first multiparty election ever 
mongolia has been ruled by the communists since 1921 when it 
gained independence from china with soviet help it has remained in 
the soviet bloc since 
nearfinal results from sundays primary showed only 101 of the 
five opposition parties 338 candidates survived the first round 
said the vice president of the national election commission 
khurmitbek 
for the first attempt its good said zorig leader of the 
opposition mongolian democratic association he said the opposition 
hoped to win 40 to 50 seats in the national legislature in next 
sundays runoff 
the communist partys chairman gombojavyn ochirbat said a 
communist victory would not end mongolias dramatic transformation 
since december from an authoritarian oneparty state obedient to 
moscow to a multiparty nation eager for western contact and 
investment 
we are confident to say that mongolian society is standing 
firmly on the path of restructuring he told a news conference 
he president punsalmagiin ochirbat and other top communist 
officials survived the primary government officials said the two 
ochirbats are not related 
most leaders of the opposition groups also won zorig said 
about 2400 candidates from all parties ran in the primary for 
430 seats in the national legislature the great peoples hural 
primaries were held in districts with more than two candidates a 
total of 799 survive for the second round 
the new legislature will elect a president 
prime minister sharavyn gunjaadorg told a news conference the 
elections so far had been comparatively free and fair 
of course since we are exercising this kind of election for 
the first time there are some shortcomings and some bumps he 
said 
party chairman ochirbat said he was willing for some 
noncommunists to sit on the new cabinet 
zorig said he had seen isolated cases of irregularities in 
sundays primary partly because of confusion over how to fill out 
the ballots 
i know a few cases where people at polling centers were trying 
to suggest what person voters should vote for he said 
one of 19 foreign observers maciej jankowski of polands 
solidarity reported similar incidents but called these mistakes 
rather than deliberate attempts to cheat 
the us observer team said it would make its comments to 
election officials 
mongolia is especially eager that the election be perceived as 
fair because secretary of state james a baker iii is to visit next 
week and discuss extending mostfavored nation trade status to 
mongolia 
formed only over the past few months the five noncommunist 
parties claim a combined membership of about 12000 to the ruling 
partys 98000 
although the opposition appears to have substantial support in 
cities where half of mongolias 2 million people live it has had 
to scramble to reach the rural people 
many herders are only dimly aware of the mass demonstrations in 
ulan bator beginning in december that forced the communists to 
agree to elections they know even less of the anticommunist 
revolutions in eastern europe that inspired mongolias opposition 
the opposition hopes however to win a significant presence in 
the 53seat small hural which will govern between the great 
hurals annual sessions 
in the great hural one seat is allocated for every 2000 rural 
residents but only every 10000 urban residents hurting the 
citybased opposition 
the communists recently have embraced many of the goals of the 
opposition including its demand for marketstyle economic reforms

an ariane rocket successfully 
lifted a double payload of french and german tv satellites into 
orbit tuesday night five months after a similar rocket exploded 
minutes after takeoff 
the rocket blasted off at 725 pm 625 pm edt from the 
ariane space center in french guiana on the northeast coast of 
south america and deployed the two satellites into orbit in less 
than 25 minutes officials reported 
ariane flight 37 was the first launch of a european rocket since 
an ariane carrying two japanese communications satellites blew up 
less than two minutes after takeoff feb 22 launches were 
suspended after the accident 
tuesdays flight put the fivechannel french television 
satellite tdf 2 and the 11channel dfs kopernikus 2 for west 
germanys deutsche bundespost telekom into geostationary orbit 
always staying above the same spot on the earths surface 
all preparations proceeded smoothly mission chief yvan cherica 
reported he said the weather was good despite worries of a storm 
before the launch 
the ariane project has been dogged by embarrassing and costly 
setbacks including rockets that have exploded or crashed and 
expensive delays 
but ariane rockets dominate the private aerospace industry 
carrying about half the worlds commercial payloads into space 
arianespace the commercial branch of the european space agency 
has contracts worth 28 billion to launch 37 more satellites 
the french satellite launched tuesday weighs 4621 pounds and 
will join a twin already in orbit to form a powerful relay system 
that can serve 400 million television viewers arianespace said 
kopernikus weighs 3126 pounds 
tuesdays flight is important in two ways said arianespace 
directorgeneral charles bigot 
it is putting into orbit two satellites of the countries who 
have given the most support to ariane politically technologically 
and industrially it is also the flight in which we pick up after 
the failure of flight 36 
ariane officials say that failure was caused by a small piece of 
cloth that clogged a line carrying water coolant to one engine 
the french weekly lexpress said sabotage may have caused that 
explosion and at least two previous ariane failures 
arianespace officials have said no evidence of sabotage emerged 
but technical and security checks would be intensified 
februarys failure was the fifth in the ariane series and was 
particularly costly because arianespace had lobbied hard for the 
japanese contracts 
tuesdays satellites were lifted into space by an ariane 4 
rocket the latest version introduced in 1988 it features four 
strapon boosters powered by liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen and 
stands 190 feet high on the launch pad 
a newer version the heavylift launcher ariane 5 is being 
developed for planned introduction in 1995 
arianespace is a consortium made up of aerospace electronics 
and banking companies from 11 western european countries belgium 
britain denmark france ireland italy netherlands spain 
switzerland sweden and west germany 
its rockets have sent into space 45 commercial satellites from 
canada france west germany britain india italy spain and the 
united states as well as international organizations such as 
intelsat and eutelsat 
ariane is facing increased competition however from american 
privatesector rockets including the titan4 made by martin 
marietta corp general dynamics atlascentaur and the delta built 
by mcdonnell douglas 
other rivals include chinas long march rocket the soviet 
unions proton and japans h2 rocket now under development 
until now us rockets have mainly launched military and 
scientific satellites under the supervision of the us air force 
and the national aeronautics and space administration

for the advancement of colored people called on the public to 
denounce those responsible for the fires 
we ask in the wake of this latest vicious attack against the 
naacp when will this madness cease he said 
hooks accused law enforcement agencies of inadequately guarding 
the office in this atlanta suburb after the first attack july 16 
when a gasoline bomb was thrown through a window the office of the 
naacps clayton county chapter was vacant then and damage was 
described as minor 
police lt douglas jewett said two molotov cocktails were found 
inside the building and two outside early tuesday 
the firebombing was under investigation by the fbi the georgia 
bureau of investigation and local police and fire departments 
the fbi took the case because the incidents could be racially 
motivated and the violation of civil rights statutes could be 
involved said joseph l coleman a special agent in atlanta 
jewett said police have not established a motive for the attacks 
the fire burned holes in walls and destroyed furniture and 
documents 
james jackson president of the naacp chapter said he has no 
plans to relocate the office 
this is really ridiculous but were going to stay here in 
the county he said

gov mario cuomo signed legislation tuesday 
to give new yorkers the power to designate someone to make 
lifeanddeath medical decisions for them when they are no longer 
able to 
cuomos action makes new york the first state to change its laws 
regarding living wills since the us supreme court last month 
ruled that the constitution guarantees a person the right to refuse 
medical treatment 
new york was one of just nine states that lacked such a law 
the choices posed by medical advances will still be difficult 
but the added anguish of legal uncertainty and confusion will 
be removed for patients who have created a health care proxy 
cuomo said 
the bill effective in six months allows new yorkers to 
designate a friend or relative to make health care decisions for 
them such as when lifesupport systems should be unplugged the 
proxy must be signed in front of two witnesses and two doctors must 
certify a patient is no longer able to make such decisions before 
the proxy can be used 
proxy forms will be distributed in such places as hospitals 
nursing homes and doctors offices said tracy miller executive 
director of the state task force on life and the law the health 
department is also printing a brochure that will explain the new 
rights to people she said 
the legislation was passed a week after the supreme court in a 
decision involving a missouri woman named nancy cruzan gave a 
boost to living will legislation new york states highest 
court has said a competent adult has the right to refuse medical 
treatment even if it is lifesustaining

attorney general dick thornburgh complained 
tuesday of the unwillingness of federal courts to punish 
savings and loan fraud with long jail terms but said punishment 
was becoming tougher 
we have been troubled throughout the course of this effort by 
the seeming unwillingness of judges to impose stiff sentences 
thornburgh told the senate judiciary committee 
he was responding to criticism from the panels chairman sen 
joseph biden ddel who cited fbi statistics showing the average 
sampl offender in 1989 received a sentence of 19 years while the 
average bank robber was sentenced to 94 years 
whether bank robbers steal their loot with a pistol or with a 
pencil either way they should serve hard time biden said 
thornburgh making his first congressional appearance devoted to 
sampls since financial institution fraud has become a hot political 
topic said the sentences have been more to his liking since the 
supreme court upheld federal sentencing guidelines in january 1989 
of late we have had considerable improvement in particular 
cases where major executives of failed savings and loans have been 
convicted of fraud he said citing several cases 
on friday a federal judge in california sentenced janet faye 
mckinzie to 20 years in prison and restitution of 134 million 
she had been found guilty of stealing millions of dollars from 
north america savings and loan association santa ana calif 
last month woody lemons former chairman of vernon savings and 
loan association vernon texas was sentenced to 30 years 
in written testimony the nations top sampl regulator timothy 
ryan said that stiff sentences unfortunately are the 
exception 
ryan director of the office of thrift supervision cited a 
number of examples for instance an alabama sampl vice president 
found responsible for 2 million in losses was given one year of 
unsupervised probation he said 
thornburgh endorsed gettough legislation passed 991 by the 
senate two weeks ago it increases the maximum jail sentence for a 
single count of sampl fraud from 20 years to 30 years and establishes 
a life sentence for socalled sampl kingpins they are defined as 
people who acted in concert with others to steal 5 million or more 
however the attorney general said similar legislation moving 
through the house has provisions that would interfere with the 
administrations pursuit of thrift fraud 
in a separate development the judiciary subcommittee on 
antitrust monopolies and business rights authorized four subpoenas 
in the panels investigation of bluebonnet savings bank dallas an 
institution created in a december 1988 federal bailout 
the panel chaired by sen howard m metzenbaum dohio is 
looking into whether the nowdefunct federal savings and loan 
insurance corp should have awarded bluebonnet to james fail a 
phoenix ariz insurance company owner 
fail put up only 1000 of his own money to acquire the sampl and 
was selected even though a company he controlled in alabama had 
pleaded guilty to fraud in 1976 
the subcommittee authorized subpoenas for thomas lykos former 
assistant director of the fslic and robert pennington former 
president of an insurance company controlled by fail 
it also authorized subpoenas for fail and robert thompson a gop 
lobbyist who represented fail in the deal but said the two should 
first be given a chance to cooperate voluntarily the two have been 
challenging whether metzenbaums subcommittee has jurisdiction over 
sampls 
metzenbaum told the subcommittee that documents in his 
possession show that thompson a former aide to then vice president 
george bush claimed a 2 percent interest in bluebonnet worth 
millions of dollars 
nancy coffey the senators spokeswoman said she could not 
release the documents or describe them lance morgan a spokesman 
for thompson declined to comment

just as the bush administration and congress 
are gearing up to fight savings and loan crooks a new study 
indicates that fraud caused only a small percentage of thrift 
losses 
bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria va 
maintains that fraud cost 5 billion or only 3 percent of what he 
figures is the bailouts 147 billion total cost 
most of the losses come from falling real estate values and from 
excessive interest rates paid by ailing institutions to attract 
depositors he figures bad bailout deals made in 1988 and losses 
on junk bonds also contributed 
fraud nevertheless has become the focus of political debate on 
sampls attorney general dick thornburgh making his first

in its most detailed finding congressional investigators 
questioned whether pierces former law firm a former top aide and 
pierce himself may have violated federal bribery conspiracy and 
conflictofinterest laws during his tenure as secretary of housing 
and urban development 
the panel said evidence also suggested pierce who served 
throughout the eightyear reagan administration may have committed 
perjury at a panel hearing when he denied involvement in the 
awarding of key grants 
it is obvious that secretary pierce did not give us the full 
story the panel wrote however some of his statements stand

offering advice on how hard workers can become happy campers 
the health and welfare ministry this week released a 38page 
report titled a study on how to take proper rest and 
recuperation it suggests japanese forget about their jobs when 
they leave the office and take leisurely and lengthy vacations 
concepts wellrooted in the west but yet to take hold here 
to help the nation relax the government report offers a wide 
range of general guidelines 
for example it argues that constant overtime work cuts down on 
sleep adversely affects the quality of work and results in 
chronic fatigue physically and mentally eventually leading to 
bad health and illness

for 80yearold hilda berikoff the 
reparations she received this year for her world war ii evacuation 
and internment meant the end of one bureaucratic battle and the 
beginning of another 
legally reparations should have no effect on public assistance 
but bureaucratic and communication snags are costing berikoff and 
some other elderly aleuts their medicaid coupons and oldage 
benefits 
berikoff said she hasnt gotten that aid for a couple of months 
i was getting it all the time before she said but then when 
they found out i had money in the bank i think i stopped getting 
it 
at least three people in this aleutian island village have had 
their assistance suspended or canceled by the state division of 
public assistance said marti norton a fee agent who helps people 
correspond with the agency 
a lot of these elderly people arent familiar with paperwork 
and theyre being required to provide more and more information 
said norton one person even had his case closed 
the number of aleuts denied aid in smaller villages without fee 
agents may be much higher 
aleuts on the aleutian and pribilof islands were evacuated on 24 
hours notice after the japanese bombed unalaska in 1942 berikoff 
said she still can close her eyes and hear bombs dropping and feel 
the fear and panic 
the aleuts were taken to camps in southeast alaska for 2 
years the berikoffs lived in a defunct cannery and bunkhouse on 
burnett island four families shared a room with one large table 
many slept on the table others on the floor berikoff stuffed 
blankets under the doors to keep out the cold 
they said theyd have everything for us ready in southeast and 
when we got there there was nothing she said i had two little 
kids so it was pretty hard on me 
many aleuts returned after the war to find their homes and 
belongings missing or destroyed and the russian orthodox church 
vandalized for years they sought reparations berikoff was among 
those who lobbied congress 
in 1988 congress approved reparations of 12000 per person to 
be distributed by the bureau of indian affairs 
berikoff has arthritis doing without medicaid coupons and 136 
in oldage benefits each month means she has little money left 
after paying bills she said she has spent most of her reparations 
money to fix her house 
i wouldnt be able to go to the clinic unless they pay she 
said 
in berikoffs case the division sent a letter saying it would 
close her file unless she provided a copy of her bank statement 
proof she received reparations and an account of what she did with 
the money norton said 
im really offended that they would burden an 80yearold lady 
with all of this said norton this payment was supposed to 
make up for wrongs it was supposed to make their lives a little 
easier 
of some 550 aleuts eligible for reparations all but about 130 
received checks by may said dimitri philemonof executive director 
of the nonprofit native corporation aleutianpribilof islands 
association the rest he said will be paid by next year 
the money should not affect individuals government aid 
reparations are not considered income and are not taxable 
state welfare workers were told this but some were confused and 
in at least one case benefits to an aleut were cut off without 
proper notice said curtis lomas a program officer in juneau 
workers will receive new materials to reiterate the rules he 
said 
the state must make sure that the 12000 its publicaid clients 
received were reparations lomas said if the division doesnt get 
the right documents it sends letters giving clients 10 to 15 days 
to respond 
if its not provided after a reasonable period of time we 
have no choice but to close the case he said there are people 
who just dont respond 
norton said some older aleuts who receive packets in the mail 
dont open them immediately 
many of them are intimidated when you get a big fat envelope 
in the mail she said a lot of them would put it on a dresser 
for awhile and look at it because they were sure it was bad news 
then theyd bring it to me and a lot of times it was too late 
state aid forms are dense and hard to read even for people whose 
first language is english norton said many elderly aleuts speak 
little or no english 
lomas says welfare officials do the best we can we dont have 
the capability of issuing notices in aleut 
reparations have created other problems i think there are 
some carpetbaggers out there ready to pounce on people with new 
wealth philemonof said all of a sudden youve got friends 
norton tells of one man who bought a goldnugget watch and ring 
and drank away the rest of his settlement in a month then he had 
to sell the jewelry 
one of the biggest problems people have run into philemonof 
said is cashing checks in smaller villages theres not enough 
revenue there and they were more or less forced to come into 
anchorage he said

a tragedy vast in scope is unfolding on the arid

beyond bukharas irrigated deserts the 
noble amu darya river dwindles down to a pathetic poisonous 
trickle a victim in one of the worlds worst ecological disasters 
deprived of the amu darya and its sister stream the syr darya 
the aral sea is dying within 30 years what was the worlds fourth 
largest inland sea is expected to be only a dry bed of deadly salt 
scientists say the seas condition reflects a far greater crisis 
across much of central asia caused by years of soviet insistence 
on defying nature to plant cotton in the desert 
near the aral the effects are devastating authorities refused 
entry to a western reporter seeking to verify reports of the 
highest infant mortality rates in the world 
but videotape made in june by a soviet filmmaker showed 
ecological refugees in squalid camps a hospital full of children 
poisoned by their mothers milk and whole communities disappearing 
in some places doctors said on film 63 percent of the children 
are sick with lung or kidney disorders damaged livers rickets 
pneumonia anemia or other diseases sickness comes from pesticides 
and defoliants inhaled with blowing salt or swallowed with tainted 
water mothers pass on chemicals to nursing infants 
the physical setting has suffered as dramatically 
rusting hulks sit stranded on a vast desert once a seabed the 
remains of one of the soviet unions richest inland fishing fleets 
no fish has been caught in the aral since 1977 
the filmmaker andrei yatsenia was among specialists who met in 
tashkent late in may to focus attention on what they agreed was 
the ecological plunder of central asia 
this is catastrophic said permat shermuhamedov a regional 
legislator who heads the committee to save the aral sea at this 
rate the sea is finished 
the experts blamed two problems widespread irrigation by raw 
gashes in the porous earth which wastes as much water as it 
carries and the excessive use of pesticides defoliants and 
corrosive chemicals that pollute the remaining seawater 
since 1960 the aral sea has lost half its surface area the 
equivalent of almost two lake eries each year winds carry 
millions of tons of salt from dried lakebeds tainting fields up to 
a thousand miles away 
close to its former shores the lake is already regarded as a 
mass murderer 
in parts of karakalpakia an autonomous region of uzbekistan 
the official infant mortality rate is 112 per 1000 four times the 
soviet average and higher than in most poor african nations 
but doctors say even that figure is understated 
pediatricians in some pockets say the rate is 500 every 
second child dies in his first year said gulchehra nurullaeva a 
poet and official of birlik an uzbek grassroots opposition party 
doctors link the high rate directly to health problems from the 
dying aral sea 
karakalpak authorities invited a correspondent to investigate 
conditions but the uzbekistan foreign ministry would not grant a 
visa 
what can we do with the land salted and no water asked one 
desperate father on yatsenias tape in a squatter camp of 650 mud 
hovels if the aral dies hundreds and thousands will die with 
it 
in the moribund town of muynak water once lapped at the back 
door of a large cannery now the sea is at least 14 miles away the 
plant still operates frozen fish are brought thousands of miles 
from the ocean 
even here in bukhara 400 miles to the south the crisis is 
evident 
every fall at the edge of this ancient caravan hub the 
madaniyat collective farm picks its cotton crop and bundles it off 
toward moscow and every year the cost is higher 
long ago bukharas zeravshan river exhausted itself before 
reaching the amu darya bled by too many irrigation canals to 
replace it a new canal was cut to drain yet more of the amu darya 
before fields can be planted they must be washed clean of salt 
and excess chemicals which are carried down toward the aral 
a decade ago a grand dream envisioned a 1400mile 
multibilliondollar canal from siberia to the amu darya but that 
would devastate siberian marshes environmentalists showed 
with no alternate sources central asia water users merely 
fought harder for their allotments 
the tragedy is that most of this water is just wasted into 
the desert and into the air said vladimir kovaleyev a geologist 
who has studied the problem for decades 
i shouted in literaturnaya gazeta in 1975 but people were 
deaf he said brandishing clippings from other papers as well 
today they still are not listening

the first time special prosecutor edward j 
kuriansky uncovered a major case of foot fraud an 800000 scam 
in 1985 he was convinced it was an aberration 
he was wrong 
dr jeffry simon proved him wrong to the tune of 18 million 
the seigal brothers did the same with 12 million and dr michael 
s greenburgh made kuriansky 965000 wrong 
these four along with dozens of other podiatric specialists 
made fortunes handoverfeet through medicaid ripoffs uncovered in 
a state crackdown on crooked podiatrists 
i heard someone refer to it as whitecollar wilding and 
thats not too far off the mark said kuriansky who was dubbed 
medicaid frauds top gun in a podiatric staff magazine article 
focusing on his efforts against corrupt foot doctors 
but those efforts particularly in the past year have drawn an 
angry outcry from podiatrists who contend kuriansky has overstepped 
his role of prosecutor and assumed the role of zealot the new 
york state podiatric medicine association has promised to fight a 
recent round of indictments brought by kurianskys office 
kuriansky and the podiatrists agree that ripoffs are not 
confined to any branch of medicine but podiatry due to 
sinceclosed loopholes in state medicaid policies became the most 
fertile fastbuck field kuriansky said 
podiatrists looked at feet and saw golden arches during the 
mid1980s he said 
doctors who were not required to get prior medicaid approval 
would order expensive orthopedic devices and deliver inferior 
products the most popular scam had the doctors funneling patients 
to shoe stores in return for kickbacks with everybody making a 
quick illegal buck 
they knew the system they knew they werent being watched 
and they exploited it mercilessly said kuriansky there was a 
feeding frenzy by podiatrists and orthopedic shoe vendors from 1983 
through 1986 
statistics bear him out in 1982 medicaid billings in new york 
state for orthopedic footwear totaled 2 million by 1985 they 
skyrocketed to 30 million that same year podiatrists billings 
for office visits and services hit an alltime high of 35 million 
since the state crackdown the figures are down to 2 million 
for footwear and 175 million for office billings but the 
cheating goes on as the steady flow of kuriansky press releases 
announcing new indictments attests 
medicaid policy changes deserve some credit for the drop but 
aggressive prosecution didnt hurt since 1985 kurianskys office 
has indicted and prosecuted 137 cases involving podiatrists 
orthotic labs and orthopedic shoe vendors the results are 
astounding 135 convictions and more than 23 million in fines and 
restitution 
medical fraud is not a solely a new york problem dick ekfelt 
spokesman for the national health care antifraud association in 
washington estimates it costs more than 10 billion a year 
nationally insurance industry estimates run as high as 80 
billion or 25 percent of the countrys annual healthcare bill 
new york state which has the nations largest medicaid system 
also has the highest number of medicaid frauds said kevin ryan a 
kuriansky spokesman 
but steve adler bureau chief for medical fraud in the 
california attorney generals office said foot fraud might be 
kind of a new york thing 
such cases are rare in california theres not enough so you 
would notice said adler who cited major ripoffs in the adult 
diaper industry as californias biggest scam 
kuriansky estimated 5 percent of new yorks 2555 licensed 
podiatrists are involved in fraud between 5 percent and 10 percent 
of all medicaid claims in the state are bogus he speculated 
in new york city evidence of the problems deep roots came when 
five doctors on the faculty at the new york college of podiatric 
medicine were indicted in a 56000 fraud case 
when you see professors engaging in the very schemes their 
students are convicted of you see a very depressing pattern 
kuriansky said 
but it was that indictment that convinced the new york state 
podiatric medicine association that kuriansky had gone too far 
said the groups executive director stanley matek 
until this year the cases he brought were legitimate but 
hes become the inspector javert of new york medicaid chasing 
after jean valjean said matek a reference to the obsessive 
manhunt that is the plot of victor hugos les miserables 
matek concedes there was a problem when kuriansky first started 
his crusade foot fraud was spreading faster than fungus five years 
ago with doctors being recruited right out of medical school 
kuriansky said 
it was an interesting phenomenon most of them were sort of 
yuppies young fresh out of podiatry schools they bankrolled 
their early careers at the expense of medicaid he said 
among them was dr michael s greenburgh indicted in october 
1988 for stealing 965000 in medicaid funds beginning in 1984 
greenburgh in an oftrepeated scenario worked in a 
povertystricken city neighborhood where medicaid recipients were 
plentiful he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one year in 
prison while agreeing to make full restitution 
one scam run by another podiatrist was advertised on fliers at 
a city high school students were offered free sneakers at certain 
shoe stores the doctor would instead file for orthopedic shoes and 
split the profit with the store 
the seigal brothers sheldon and otto were accused of making 
12 million in seven months through a sneaker scam they pleaded 
guilty and were sentenced to one to three years in prison they 
also were ordered to repay some of the money they stole 
but kuriansky described dr jeffry simon as the archetypal 
profiteer simon was charged with ripping off medicaid for 18 
million and went to great lengths to cover up his efforts 
when investigators closed in on simon the podiatrist created an 
entirely bogus lab to cover up his phony medicaid claims filling 
the room with molds made from the feet of any employee he could get 
his hands on it didnt work he was sentenced to one to three 
years 
his indictment came two years after his first bust the 800000 
scam that broke in 1985 and was then the largest medicaid fraud in 
history at the time kuriansky felt sure it couldnt be 
replicated 
he knows better now and that knowledge is not limited to 
podiatry i have not found greed limited to any part of the 
medical field its big business thats really whats going on

the local mcdonalds was under siege beset 
by a convergence of squad cars police motorcycles and 
plainclothesmen customer lynn king who just came in to get a 
shake thought there must have been a shootout 
instead she found dan quayle and his traveling road show the 
vice president was buying iced tea shaking hands and introducing 
youths in tank tops to the republican who wants to be texas 
attorney general 
do you know buster brown quayle asked pulling the 
candidate along as he distributed vice presidential pens and signed 
autographs for excited onlookers 
soon quayle whisked his entourage on to more lucrative pastures 
at a nearby hotel he sat for press interviews and then helped 
brown a state senator collect more than 100000 for his campaign 
from wellheeled gop faithful 
about 250 people paid 100 each to eat hors doeuvres and hear 
quayle speak at a standup reception sixty others forked over 
1000 each for a more exclusive reception where they were 
photographed with quayle an elite 20 2500 contributors got to 
sit on stage while he spoke 
it was a typical morning on the campaign trail with quayle the 
vice president who has battled for credibility ever since george 
bush selected him is on the road with increasing frequency as he 
devotes himself to electing other republicans 
since early this year quayle has averaged a couple of days a 
week stumping for gubernatorial state and congressional candidates 
across the country 
he is credited with raising some 12 million for party groups 
and candidates over the past 1 years he has been in 42 states and 
made return trips to places with high priority races 
he has bolstered his savvy staff by hiring an operative with 
respected political credentials michigan state party chairman 
spencer abraham to coordinate his travels 
while quayle conducts some official business on most trips 
the political trips drive the whole schedule said his press 
secretary david beckwith 
by combining vice presidential events with politicking the vice 
president can charge part of his travel to the taxpayers the 
political part is charged to the republican party organizations 
quayles principle mission is raising money he also generates 
considerable local media coverage like the pageone austin 
americanstatesman photo of him holding a child in mcdonalds 
the republican national committee touts him as immensely 
successful on the money front 
he really is extremely popular among the party types the 
state chairmen said bj cooper a spokesman for the committee 
hes very effective wherever he goes 
he has been a very very effective fundraising tool said 
ed rogers who oversees political operations at the white house 
quayles assignment is not to swing votes or lead rallies 
rather he focuses on filling gop coffers in a year when both 
parties are jockeying for the upper hand in preparation for the 
redrawing of legislative district lines 
even democrats who insist quayle is a policy lightweight give 
him backhanded credit for political skill 
our sense is they are using him almost solely to stoke the 
fires in their own political base camp said mike mccurry 
spokesman for the democratic national committee hes very 
successful 
while quayle says that to a large extent the novelty factor 
has worn off following relentless negative press early in his 
tenure it seems the curiosity factor still draws people to see him 
many people dont know whether what theyve read about him is 
true said lee yaekel gop chairman in travis county texas 
a lot of people want to meet him know a little bit about 
him 
as for raising money yaekel said the vice president of the 
united states is the vice president of the united states and 
wealthy republicans are going to shell out top dollars to see him 
in raleigh nc republicans had only two weeks notice that 
quayle was coming to town just a few weeks after president bush 
had campaigned there for sen jesse helms 
despite the close timing of the two visits the party managed to 
get 18 people to put up 2000 each for a private reception and 
photo with quayle and 270 people to pay 125 each for a luncheon 
said andy wright state gop political director 
although he carefully avoids discussing the topic quayle also 
reaps personal benefits through his nationwide travel 
aides privately acknowledge that the politicking gives quayle a 
chance to establish a network of supporters for his own future as 
bush did in making himself the heir apparent to ronald reagan 
beckwith refused to comment on whether quayle is laying that 
kind of base but he allowed loyal partybuilding work served 
george bush well 
quayle too sidesteps questions about his aspirations 
i would acknowledge that its building up friendships its 
building up contacts i know people all over the country now that 
are quite supportive of me and supportive of george bush and it 
doesnt hurt the president to have the vice president out there 
making friends all the time he said 
in the meantime a more polished practiced quayle is emerging 
his stump speech a call to arms for the bush agenda and for making 
gop headway in the democraticcontrolled congress is paced for 
applause lines he delivers it in a more natural style than the 
stiff quayle of months past 
at every stop he meets with local reporters and sits for tv 
interviews smoothly giving the administration line on the issues 
of the day 
he appeared momentarily stumped when a tv reporter asked how if 
he did not know buster brown very well he could give him such a 
laudatory recommendation 
quayle recovered quickly saying that bush knows brown and 
the presidents word to me is golden 
local reporters while sometimes complaining that he glosses 
over issues often express surprise at his smoothness and 
unflappability 
he was a little bit sharper than i thought he would be said

it is high noon and 108 degrees in the shade at 
the ritzy residential compound called spanish trail a vista green 
and wet almost as far as the eye can see past the golf course the 
artificial pond the bubbling fountains and the pristine pools 
right up to the edge of the desert 
there is water water everywhere in las vegas 
it runs off neat lawns from sprinklers going fullblast at the 
hottest time of a scorching day it rolls down sidewalks and 
gutters and streets and evaporates like a gamblers stake never to 
be seen again 
while the west coast suffers through the fourth year of a 
drought that has people feeling guilty for taking showers and 
flushing toilets from san diego to san francisco las vegas a 
city dry and dusty as a neon bone save for its share of colorado 
river water has been busy doubling the number of golf courses and 
building 4000room hotels 
but now its unstoppable growth and unquenchable thirst have 
thrust americas desert playground into a bitter power struggle 
with the rest of nevada a showdown being played out in states all 
over the west urban takes on rural in a water war some say 
threatens to tear nevada apart 
if you work on the premise lets not do anything about 
future water supply and lets just let it run its course and when 
we run out then well have to stop thats economic homicide 
said pat mulroy general manager of the las vegas valley water 
district which regulates water in much of clark county 
the regions explosive growth caught the water district with its 
hydrological pants down 
its allocation from the colorado river the seemingly endless 
bounty that has kept the area afloat and awash for years suddenly 
appears to be insufficient in the wake of a twoyear growth spurt 
that has brought 6000 new residents each month 
why didnt we see this sooner it just fell on us absolutely 
fell on us mulroy said the first year we thought thats got 
to be construction water because of all the massive construction 
going on so in the second year 1989 we finally said wait a 
minute somethings got to be done 
what the district did was ask the state water engineer to grant 
it the rights to an ocean of unappropriated groundwater in 20000 
square miles most of it in nye lincoln and white pine counties 
three huge rural areas to the north the plan involves constructing 
1200 miles of pipeline over the next 30 years to transport that 
water out of the desert and to the people 
the multibilliondollar project its cost is placed at between 
15 billion and 7 billion depending on whos estimating is 
described as three times the size of the huge central arizona 
project which carries colorado river water over the mountains to 
phoenix and tucson 
and it is at least five times the size of the disastrous owens 
county water grab by los angeles 77 years ago the legendary 
scandal that inspired roman polanskis movie chinatown 
you can put taxes on us you can do anything to us said nye 
county commissioner dick carver a lifelong rancher but you 
take my water im done i cant exist 
in nevada where water is lifeblood and ultimate power water 
law is a century old applications for water rights must be 
approved by the state water engineer who decides whether the 
applications meet three criteria is the water unappropriated 
would rights affect any existing rights and are the appropriations 
in the public interest 
so far his meetings with the counties have ended in shouting 
matches 
theyre more than upset theyre outraged said state water 
engineer mike turnipseed who could start making decisions on the 
applications as early as this fall they fear more than just the 
basic idea of youre stealing my water they feel its a threat 
to their economic existence 
the counties believe their future already is in clark countys 
hands any business that wants to move in needs water if the water 
rights are approved the rural counties will have to ask clark 
county for it if the dispute ends up in court as both sides 
believe the water might be tied up for years 
basically you end up with somewhat of an annexation of the 
counties said george benesch an attorney for the rural areas 
it scares the counties to death 
scares them so much in fact that they have turned to their 
sworn enemies for help ranchers and miners whose battles over 
water date back 100 years have joined forces and theyve enlisted 
the aid of others who they have often considered adversaries 
environmentalists and the federal government 
weve had the sierra club come in with the wilderness issue 
and we fought wilderness carver said but now were saying 
wont you please come and help us because without water what 
goods a wilderness area 
their greatest allies in fact may turn out to be the inchlong 
pupfish the last 400 or so of which live in devils hole national 
monument near death valley and other endangered species on 
federal land clark county has said it plans to temporarily remove 
more groundwater than is replenished over time a process park 
officials say can upset delicate ecological balances 
the water source at devils hole is so sensitive the drop of 
the water table there a matter of inches could expose the rock 
shelf on which the algae grows that is the pupfishes only source 
of survival said ed rothfuss superintendent of death valley 
the federal bureau of land management which controls most of 
the land in nevada plans to protest most if not all the 
applications as do the national park service and the fish and 
wildlife service when clark county asks to use federal land the 
bureau of land management has the power to order an environmental 
impact statement which the counties hope could stop the project 
for good 
where the battle is going to be fought probably in court is 
the decision of what is in the public interest said steve 
bradhurst a planning consultant hired by the rural counties to 
coordinate their attack 
more than anything else perhaps it is the spectre of the owens 
valley that most frightens the rural counties agents for los 
angeles secretly bought up water rights in 1913 now los angeles 
ships almost all the valleys water 250 miles south via two giant 
aqueducts 
the valleys thriving agricultural landscape was reduced to a 
noxious dustbowl by the depletion of its water decimated and 
nearly dead it remains one of the oldest surviving symbols of 
urban greed and contempt for the rural areas in the west despite 
the water districts assurances that it would never happen 
nevadas counties fear they might become the newest one 
las vegas has to be crazy if they think were going to lay 
down and watch them do this to us said carver who raises 
alfalfa and cattle on his 860 acres in nye county

in a state with few people the city with the 
most wins the power game in nevada that makes las vegas the 
undisputed champ 
las vegas which welcomes as many as 6000 new residents a 
month is the reason nevada is the nations fastestgrowing state 
the citys population is expected to reach 1 million by 1995 four 
times what it was in 1980 
an estimated 800000 people live there now out of 13 million 
in the state as a whole the three rural counties fighting clark 
countys water plan have a combined population of less than 35000 
that means clark county controls the nevada legislature 36 of 
63 state lawmakers are from the las vegas area and the contingent 
is sure to grow with next years reapportionment so what clark 
county wants clark county has the numbers to get 
if theres something in state water law we can hang our hat on 
to deter this plan the power is in las vegas and clark county and 
theyll just go ahead and change the law said steve bradhurst a 
consultant to the rural counties 
las vegas also is the states financial anchor last year clark 
county casinos accounted for 70 percent of the states 46 billion 
in gaming revenues clark county needs to keep growing for the 
states economic health officials say 
there is one large metropolitan area from which the bulk of 
all revenues in this state come and thats clark county said

it goes downhill the whole state goes downhill

nye is the third largest county in the nation with a population 
that averages one person for each of its 18000 square miles las 
vegas population of 800000 is expected to reach 1 million by 
1995 supplemented by some 18 million tourists a year 
at that rate clark countys colorado allocation of about 
300000 acre feet an acre foot is about 326000 gallons the 
amount of water it takes to cover an acre to the depth of one foot 
enough to supply a family of four for a year will last just into 
the 21st century with some conservation the water district 
estimated 
changing the colorado river compact would take an agreement by 
other states that share the water an unlikely scenario california 
drains the basins south of las vegas leaving barely enough water 
for two hotels mulroy said the only option she said was 
unappropriated groundwater in nevada 
if you say the valley needs an additional supply where does 
it go it has nowhere else to go mulroy said this really is 
the extremes where youve got one community that has no 
alternative and where the entire state is dependent on the 
economic livelihood of that community clark countys economic base 
is the states economic base 
opponents of the plan believe that clark countys colorado 
water plus properly conserved water from basins within its own 
borders would last well into the next century 
they scoff at the districts firstever conservation plan which 
introduces tiered water rates that hit big users landscaping and 
building requirements and public education campaigns artificial 
lakes have been banned and officials are allowed to turn off 
sprinklers if water is running into the streets a conservative 
first time out mulroy calls the plan 
the constant flow of tourists helps make the citys water 
consumption among the nations highest 380 gallons per person each 
day more than twice as high as tucson and 50 percent higher than 
phoenix 
but tourists arent the only reason for that figure las vegans 
have always had more water than they needed and they have used it 
with gusto ponds fountains and pools abound there are at least 
21 golf courses in and around las vegas twice as many as six years 
ago hotels and housing are popping up as fast as the desert can be 
graded 
all the contracts on the colorado river are built around 
developing your water resource the useitorloseit theory 
mulroy said adding that 80 percent of the areas water comes from 
the colorado so nevadas water contracts are structured 
around a race to use and develop that water to stake your claim to 
it 
rural nevadans care little about why clark county wastes water 
or about efforts to scale back they are just galled by the 
injustice of it 
it makes us sick carver said you go to las vegas they 
water 24 hours a day seven days a week and it runs down the 
streets 
the bottom line however is that clark county has the people 
and the power even state engineer turnipseed acknowledges that any 
decision he makes could be overturned by the countys powerful 
legislative contingent the rural counties know that but they have 
no intention of giving in 
there have been lives lost in the west over water and we can 
see that kind of feeling here carver said what its going to 
be now is a civil war

an attorney representing a gop lobbyist 
involved in a controversial savings and loan bailout asked the 
senate ethics committee on monday to investigate whether sen 
howard m metzenbaum dohio or his aides struck a sordid deal 
to share investigative material with the new york times 
attorney stanley m brand representing lobbyist robert j 
thompson a former aide to thenvice president george bush asked 
the panel to initiate an ethics inquiry into improper conduct 
which reflects upon the senate and which may include violations of 
federal and state law by metzenbaum or senate staff 
members 
metzenbaum chairs the judiciary subcommittee on antitrust 
monopolies and business rights which is looking into thompsons 
involvement in negotiating the bailout of 15 thrift institutions 
now combined under the name of bluebonnet savings bank dallas 
meanwhile the times reported in tuesday editions that thompson 
invested 100000 with a federal regulator paul g heafy who also 
was involved in thompsons negotiations to buy an insolvent bank in 
oklahoma the newspaper reported that the investment which was to 
buy distressed loans from federal regulators did not violate 
conflict of interest laws but senate investigators wanted to look 
into the financing of the deal 
heafy is chief liquidator for the federal deposit insurance 
corp in oklahoma city he and thompson refused the times requests 
for interviews 
brand said there is substantial probability that new york 
times reporter jeff gerth obtained access to confidential 
investigative information from brian mctigue an aide to 
metzenbaum the information including private financial records 
was obtained under the cloak of senate authority and was 
released inappropriately to the times brand said 
in december 1988 thompson represented james m fail a phoenix 
ariz insurance executive who acquired the thrifts fail paid the 
government 1000 of his own money and 70 million in borrowed 
funds to obtain bluebonnet which was bailed out with a government 
subsidy estimated at 18 billion 
the nowdefunct federal home loan bank board selected fail as 
the acquirer over a competing group even though an insurance 
company he controlled had pleaded guilty to fraud in 1976 in 
alabama 
the new york times ran a frontpage story on questions 
surrounding the bluebonnet deal july 8 the day before metzenbaums 
subcommittee held its hearing 
it now appears indisputable that sensitive investigative 
information gathered in the name of the us senate was 
deliberately intentionally and inappropriately given to a major 
national newspaper brand wrote 
if this type of investigative information is released 
maliciously to reporters it can cause incalculable harm to private 
persons this is exactly what appears to have happened in this case 
in what can only be described as a sordid deal to provide the 
senates investigative information to a single newspaper in return 
for favorable coverage on the eve of the senates hearing he 
wrote 
brand based his complaint in part on a statement from cable 
news network reporter brooks jackson who said he was told by 
metzenbaums staff that they had made an exclusive arrangement to 
share information with gerth in exchange for an agreement that the 
times would hold the story until the day before the hearing 
jackson who was quoted in saturday editions of the washington 
post said he was quoted accurately but declined to reveal which 
metzenbaum aide had told him about the arrangement with the times 
mctigue declined to comment referring questions to metzenbaums 
press spokeswoman nancy coffey gerth also declined to comment and 
referred inquires to howell raines the newspapers washington 
bureau chief 
raines said as a matter of policy we dont discuss sources 
or the editorial process 
he said the story was meticulously researched from a number of 
sources and was industriously and honorably reported 
coffey said metzenbaum considered brands complaint too 
ridiculous to comment on 
since when is it against the law for a senator to talk to one 
reporter she asked adding that no prearrangements were 
attached to metzenbaums comments 
nobodys rights were harmed here she said mr thompson 
is complaining because he is in trouble right now there are a lot 
of people with a lot of questions about how mr fail was able to 
get such favorable deals with his background those are legitimate 
questions 
wilson abney staff director of the ethics committee said he 
could not reveal what action the panel was taking on the complaint 
or even if it had been received he said typically complaints are 
referred to staff attorneys who can then recommend whether or not 
the complaint should be investigated 
meanwhile metzenbaums panel is continuing its investigation 
and has scheduled a second hearing for tuesday afternoon so far 
thompson and fail have declined to appear before the subcommittee 
and are disputing its jurisdiction over the matter

genius grant recipient richard 
stallman is noted as much for his eccentricities as he is for his 
prodigious talent as a computer programmer 
he can be found in his cluttered office his hair long and 
matted his bare feet cradling an open box of crackers on the cot 
where he sleeps 
stallman 37 last week was among 36 recipients of macarthur 
foundation grants 
stallman who will receive 240000 during the next five years 
is more than a gifted nerd 
in an era when his genius could earn him millions stallman 
eschews material possessions and leads a crusade for free 
computer software 
clearly i could have gone to some company and made a lot of 
money said stallman sitting crosslegged on a couch outside his 
office 
but im more interested in a certain quality of life when a 
program is free a community of enthusiasts develops he said 
the term free software does not refer to cost but to the 
idea of being able to openly share information about computer 
techniques and applications in contrast to commercial software 
applications which are restricted and sometimes patented with 
free software people can trade programs and information freely 
not unlike the idea of one person buying a cassette tape or a cd 
and allowing others to copy them 
without free software stallman argues computer enthusiasts are 
unable to improve existing programs because their knowledge is 
restricted the brave new world pioneered by freewheeling computer 
hackers in the 1970s led to a static commercial ethic that 
threatens future progress he said 
its not in the public interest everything has turned into a 
commercial trade secret he said 
stallman is one of the founders of the league for programming 
freedom which has 135 members 
the group is planning a protest march aug 2 at the cambridge 
headquarters of lotus development corp a federal judge recently 
sided with the company ruling it illegal to develop a program that 
uses the same commands and menus as an existing program 
stallman sees himself as a true hacker 
a harvard graduate he began working on the computer system at 
the massachusetts institute of technology in 1971 in the highly 
charged atmosphere of mits artificial intelligence community he 
was a legendary hacker usually at his keyboard 10 hours a day 
seven days a week for years 
eighteen months ago he developed tendinitis in his hands and 
now must employ a typist to carry out his commands 
im determined not to let it stop me he said in an 
interview 
he earns what can be considered little more than stipend money 
by working occasionally as a consultant but only on what he 
considers free software he has no grand plans for the 
nostringsattached grant apart from a trip to the soviet union 
where he was invited to meet with programmers 
he recalls the early days in the mid1970s as nearutopia in the 
hacker community but around 1980 when many hackers cashed in on 
their talents and went corporate stallman found himself a maverick 
all software was originally free said stallman there was 
a real communal feeling then in the 80s it all changed 
but stallman stuck to his ideals he left mit in 1983 to begin 
working on the development of his own system of free software his 
products are priced far less than comparable systems he said he 
has a staff of 15 people 
what i set out to do was to make a complete free system 
stallman said i want to use nothing but free software 
in the rare hours when he leaves the computer pulsing in his 
tiny cubicle stallman socializes with other hackers he has had a 
girlfriend for the past year unusual for him he said 
his farewell is always the same happy hacking

the call by the head of the house armed 
services committee to build only the 15 b2 bombers now in the 
production pipeline is the latest cloud to darken the skies over 
californias aerospace industry 
northrop officials said mondays speech by rep les aspin 
dwis is just the latest word in a long debate over the bombers 
importance as the cold war ends 
defense secretary dick cheney has proposed building 75 b2s 
down from the 132 originally envisioned 
so far only one b2 has been completed and it would take 
several years for the program to be phased out even if aspin and 
other opponents cap production at 15 operational planes 
northrop already had announced plans to decrease the 12700 
people working on the b2 program as it moves from its development 
phase to production 
by yearend northrop plans to lay off 1400 of the 10500 
workers at the los angeles suburb of pico rivera where the plane 
was developed but it will add 800 employees to the 2200 now at 
palmdale in the immense desert factory where final assembly takes 
place on the manta raylike radarevading bombers 
those layoffs announced this month are part of a 
longestablished decline in aerospace employment here 
mcdonnell douglas corp is slicing about 10000 jobs in the area 
and lockheed corp as many as 7000 over the coming years hughes 
aircraft trw and rockwell international had made big job cuts in 
southern california before this year 
at northrop itself peak employment of 48200 came at the end of 
1987 after cutting 2500 employees during the past year northrop 
announced in may it would eliminate another 3000 jobs many of 
them related to the b2 
chamber of commerce economist jack kyser said los angeles and 
orange counties have 10000 fewer aerospace jobs now than at this 
time in 1989 by the end of the year the loss is expected to be 
17000 jobs he said 
i am surprised that the cuts are coming so fast said kyser 
whose forecasts generally are at the positive end of the spectrum 
of economists predictions 
its almost like the aerospace firms see the storm warnings 
coming and theyre cutting back and getting into shape 
kyser said that its generally believed that each job lost at 
prime contractors leads to another two or three layoffs at smaller 
aerospace companies were seeing a real scramble in the 
subcontracting area he said 
northrop spokesman tony cantafio said northrop subcontracts 
about 70 percent of the work on the b2 nationwide between 30000 
and 40000 people are employed in connection with the plane most 
in california but others at boeing in washington ltv in texas 
general electric in ohio and elsewhere 
cantafio repeated arguments by b2 proponents that the 830 
millionplus cost figures routinely given for each plane are 
misleading much of that money was absorbed by the costs of 
devising new technology to make the plane nearly invisible to 
soviet radar costs that are the same whether 132 planes or none 
are built he said 
the 15 b2s now in the pipeline would cost 358 billion total 
but for 271 billion more you get 60 more airplanes cantafio 
said 
northrop gets about half of its more than 5 billion in yearly 
revenue from the b2 that heavy reliance on one program is cited 
as one of the companys biggest weaknesses along with its 800 
million debt load 
lawrence harris an aerospace analyst at bateman eichler hill 
richards in los angeles said capping the b2 program would 
generate enough cash to erase that debt as northrop reduced 
inventories collected receivable accounts and sold equipment back 
to the government 
cantafio agreed without the b2 program northrop would be a 
much smaller company with a much stronger balance sheet he said 
but if that were to happen and northrop also lost the 
competition against a team led by lockheed corp to build the 
nextgeneration advanced tactical fighter the company would 
plummet from the ranks of major aerospace contractors 
then northrop returns to where they were in the late 1970s 
major subcontractor harris said

a senate leader called on the securities and 
exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission to 
work out their differences after a report faulted both agencies for 
their conflicting analyses of last octobers stock market slide 
a general accounting office report found that differences in the 
sec and cftc studies stemmed from subjective interpretation and 
judgment 
the two rival agencies which have been embroiled in a 
jurisdictional dispute each issued reports last month analyzing 
the oct 13 190point drop in the dow jones industrial average 
both studies differed in their conclusions and both agencies 
later lambasted the others methodology prompting a senate panel 
to request a study of the issue by the gao the investigative arm 
of congress 
sec and cftc emphasize different factors and take different 
points of view to reach their conclusions this sometimes results 
in different conclusions each of which is supported by basically 
the same trading data said the gao report which was released by 
the securities subcommittee of the senate banking committee 
the sec reported that index arbitrage and other program selling 
strategies significantly worsened the market decline while the cftc 
reported that neither program trading nor futures sales explained 
the sharp price movements on the day of and first trading day after 
the drop 
index arbitrage is a computerized program trading strategy that 
seeks to take advantage of small differences between the stock and 
futures markets by simultaneously buying large orders in one market 
while selling in the other 
stock index futures often used in program trading strategies 
allow investors to trade on the movement of a basket of stocks 
without having to buy the underlying stocks 
the gao report finds the seccftc jurisdictional dispute 
continues to detract from their working relationship said sen 
christopher j dodd dconn chairman of the subcommittee 
the agencies major differences threatens their ability to 
work together to minimize risks to the capital markets this 
untenable situation must be resolved he added 
spokesmen for the sec and cftc denied that their feud was 
hurting their ability to work together on other issues 
we dont feel that the ongoing debate has compromised the 
commissions ability to work with its sister agency the sec 
said cftc spokesman david gary that fact has most recently been 
shown by todays market activity he said referring to a more 
than 100point drop in the dow during the early hours of trading 
monday 
our staff people have talked to the exchanges cftc chairman 
wendy gramm has spoken with sec chairman richard breeden and 
when appropriate we have passed along information that was 
necessary for the sec to do its job said gary 
sec officials declined to comment because they had not seen the 
final report but they noted that except for the dispute over stock 
index futures the agencies get along wonderfully 
the bush administration wants to strip the cftc of its authority 
over stock index futures and give it to the sec 
the sec said it stood by written comments on an earlier draft of 
the gao report 
in a letter to the gao richard ketchum the director of the 
secs market regulation division maintained that the secs 
findings are amply supported both by detailed analyses of 
specific trade data and extensive interviews with relevant market 
participants 
ketchums letter then went on to criticize a letter by cftc 
chairman gramm last month that faulted the sec study as 
misleading and contradictory 
in its study the sec concluded that index arbitrage and other 
program trading strategies accelerated the 69 percent market drop 
and accounted for an unusually high percentage of share volume 
during the 90minute slide

a securities and exchange commission probe into 
alleged insider trading preceding gte corps announcement of a 
deal to buy contel corp has prompted an investigation into another 
major takeover bid 
sec attorney james a kidney said monday that the commission is 
looking into trading activity surrounding the july 2 offer by 
ratners group plc britains largest jewelry chain to buy kay 
jewelers inc a retailer based in alexandria va for 328 
million 
some of the foreign accounts that are the subject of the 
contelgte probe also seem to have been doing a lot of trading in 
kay jewelers kidney said 
the lawyer made his comments while seeking a preliminary 
injunction to continue freezing accounts the sec has identified as 
holding the illegally obtained profits in the contelgte case us 
district judge charles haight jr granted the injunction 
kidney said nine swiss bank employees bought contel securities 
in the days that preceded disclosure of a 6 billion merger of the 
company and gte they were the latest to be mentioned in the probe 
the sec alleged in court papers filed july 13 the day after the 
contelgte merger was announced that individuals or entities 
whose identities are yet unknown used inside information about 
the deal to make profits of at least 1 million 
on friday the sec named four west germans and three european 
entities that allegedly traded contel securities based on inside 
information about the thenundisclosed buyout 
one of the germans has told investigators he overheard a 
conversation about the pending merger at a restaurant kidney said 
kidney said other individuals or companies that ordered the 
purchase of large blocks of contel securities through european bank 
accounts have not yet come forward 
he said it could take months before they were identified because 
the us government would have to use international treaties to 
force the banks in switzerland west germany and luxembourg to 
identify their customers 
he said union bank of switzerland was cooperating in the 
investigation and had interviewed six of its nine employees who 
bought contel call options on july 10 and 11 for their own accounts 
a call option is the right to buy 100 shares of a stock or stock 
index at a set price before a certain date because contel stock 
jumped in price after the buyout proposal was revealed a buyer of 
its call options at the preannouncement price could reap big 
profits after disclosure of the deal 
the six union bank employees were identified as frederic 
galliard alfred keller rolf koechli phillip colliard thierry 
racine and oliver roth 
bank attorney john dickey said the employees most of whom 
worked in the banks trading department in geneva bought the 
securities because they noticed an increase in contel call option 
trading and because a substantial customer had placed a large 
order for contel securities 
the customer was not identified 
the three other union bank employees had not been interviewed 
because two were on vacation and one was recovering from injuries 
from an automobile accident dickey said 
the west germans named friday by the sec are ortwin heider of 
hofheim hansjurgen klisch and hannelore mirbachkrahn both of 
meerbusch and bodo pawlik of ratingen 
the sec complaint also identified three entities accused of 
violating insider trading laws union investment a dusseldorf 
mutual fund and two companies with offices in switzerland nalasag 
corp in geneva and sigesse sa in lausanne

nearly 50 pennsylvania corporations have 
decided to exempt themselves in whole or part from the states 
tough antitakeover law and the list is growing as thursdays 
deadline for acting approaches 
by monday 47 companies had said no to embracing the full law 
and more companies were expected to join the ranks according to 
william a k titelman an attorney who lobbied against the law and 
is now tabulating the companies who are opting out 
among those taking the action are roughly half of the 
pennsylvania companies on the fortune 500 and standard and poors 
500 lists 
the more the pennsylvania business community has gotten to 
know the bill the more they dislike it at least for themselves 
titelman said in a telephone interview 
but bill baer vice president for government affairs for the 
pennsylvania chamber of business and industry which championed the 
law said it was agreed that this was not going to be one size 
fits all and companies were going to decide what was in their 
best interest 
enacted in april the law gave publicly traded companies until 
july 26 to decide privately held companies have a year to make up 
their minds 
the law regarded as the nations toughest against hostile 
takeovers for the first time requires unsuccessful raiders to 
surrender their profits if they sell the stock within 18 months of 
the attempted takeover the clause is aimed at socalled 
greenmailers who target a company they hope will buy back its 
shares at a premium to make the raiders go away 
raiders who gain 20 percent or more of a company will not get 
voting rights until other stockholders approve and company 
directors can balance the interests of stockholders employees and 
others in weighing a takeover bid 
investor groups bitterly fought the bill arguing it would 
depress stock values but proponents said it was vital to stopping 
profithungry financiers from gobbling up pennsylvania companies 
breaking them up and destroying jobs and communities 
impetus for the law came from lawmakers intent on saving 
armstrong world industries of lancaster from a takeover bid by the 
belzberg family of canada the belzbergs have since abandoned their 
plans titelman a partner in the klett lieber rooney amp schorling 
law firm of pittsburgh represented the belzbergs 
state sen noah wenger rlancaster who sponsored the law said 
he hoped companies werent being lulled by the slowdown in hostile 
takeovers and would remember that takeovers could start anew if 
financing again became available some may feel the protections 
are not as needed as they were a few years ago wenger said 
that may be deceptive 
william george president of the aflcio which succeeded in 
adding job protection sections to the law said investors have 
pressured some companies into exempting themselves he also noted 
that some companies that were presented as needing protection have 
since exempted themselves 
when lawmakers were considering the bill proponents said 
conrail was an example of a pennsylvania company that needed 
protection and the argument swayed votes to the bill 
but july 18 conrails board announced it was exempting itself 
from the sections stripping raiders profits also known as 
disgorgement and blocking immediate voting rights for a raider 
known as control shares 
company spokesman david neurohr said conrail felt initially that 
the bill moving through the legislature was a mixed bag 
although the company supported it but once optional features were 
added and remained in the law the conrail board felt compelled to 
choose those that are in the best interest of the company 
employees and community neurohr said 
among the top companies opting out of all sections of the new 
law are hj heinz co pnc financial corp westinghouse electric 
corp and the reading co 
companies opting out of disgorgement and control shares include 
allegheny ludlum corp dravo corp duquesne light co kennametal 
inc and mellon bank 
the sun co has opted out of disgorgement 
despite the decision of its board to push for the law the 
chamber of business and industry was by no means unanimous on 
accepting all its provisions 
richard ross jr the chambers chairman announced monday that 
his company first eastern corp had opted out of the disgorgement 
and control shares sections of the laws

the house has passed legislation giving the 
securities and exchange commission new powers to impose fines for 
illegal activities beyond insider trading less than a week earlier 
a similar bill cleared the senate 
the house also passed legislation that would crack down on penny 
stock fraud 
the penny stock bill which combined two earlier bills cleared 
through committee last month was passed on a voice vote by the 
house monday 
the securities enforcement and penny stock reform act of 1990 
also would give the sec authority to order alleged wrongdoers to 
cease and desist illegal activities without first having to go 
to court and obtain a restraining order 
the legislation would widen sec authority to seek court orders 
barring convicted securities law violators from serving as officers 
or directors of companies with publicly traded stock 
the senate passed a bill last week giving the sec similar 
authority to fine issue cease and desist orders and ask courts to 
bar crooks from serving as corporate officers 
a separate penny stock bill also is pending in the senate 
the penny stock provisions of the house bill would give the sec 
the power to bar crooked promoters and consultants from selling the 
highly speculative stocks which usually sell for 1 or less 
penny stocks are not traded on most stock exchanges the bulk of 
the information obtainable about them comes from the brokers sho 
sell them while not illegal penny stocks which typically are 
used to finance new or small companies are considered to be very 
risky at best 
the house bill would allow the sec 
to close a loophole that now allows unscrupulous penny stock 
brokers to evade sec removal from the securities business by 
calling themselves promoters or consultants which the sec has no 
power to regulate 
to tighten disclosure requirements for highly speculative 
investments known as blind pools and blank checks 
in their combined form these two bills represent a powerful 
expansion of the enforcement weapons available to combat the 
problems of securities fraud in general and the penny stock market 
in particular said rep edward j markey dmass who sponsored 
the initial penny stock legislation along with reps matthew 
rinaldo rnj and ron wyden dore 
the other half of the bill originally was introduced by rep 
john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and commerce 
committee which oversees the sec

resorts international incs 
bondholders have approved a reorganization plan that will give them 
78 percent of hotel and casino company leaving entertainer merv 
griffin with the rest 
the reorganization is part of the casino companys plan to 
emerge from chapter 11 bankruptcy 
the plan approved by bondholders monday must still be 
confirmed at a hearing scheduled today at us bankruptcy court in 
camden and approved by the new jersey casino control commission as 
well as the government of the bahamas 
the plan would give bondholders 78 percent of the company 
dropping griffin to 22 percent ownership resorts in turn will 
exchange the 911 million in debt held by those bondholders for a 
reduced debt service of 4303 million 
the plan filed in december and amended in april to include the 
proposed sale of resorts paradise island operations in the 
bahamas resorts officials estimated paridise island could fetch 
between 250 million and 300 million for the struggling company 
now that our bondholders have approved our plan we are 
looking forward to obtaining the courts approval resorts 
president david hanlon said in a news release our reorganization 
should be complete by the end of the summer and we will focus all 
of our energy on making resorts the finest resort and the best 
investment it can be 
bondholders have said the plan is the best way to get some 
return on their investments 
the plan gives senior secured bondholders 2928 million in new 
notes and 25 percent of griffins shares those bondholders 
approved the plan with 984 percent of the vote representing 999 
percent of the principal they owned resorts said 
holders of resorts highest paying bonds 16 percent would 
receive 324 percent of the shares and 589 million in new bonds 
those bondholders approved the plan with 90 percent of the vote 
representing 985 percent of their principal amount 
the remaining bondholders would get 431 percent of the company 
stock and 786 million in new notes they approved the plan with 
898 percent of the vote representing 936 percent of the principal 
amount 
the plan also sets aside a legal kitty of 5 million to pursue a 
possible fraudulent conveyance action against donald trump who 
swapped resorts to griffin for the newly opened taj mahal casino 
resort next door on the boardwalk 
resorts had expected that the april 2 opening of the taj mahal 
would bring more customers to that end of the boardwalk but that 
has failed to occur the casino continues its slide of declining 
gross gaming revenue or win when compared to the same time 
period the year before 
the casino has posted lower win figures each month for more than 
a year with the latest month down 127 percent from june 1989 
according to the state casino control commission for the year 
through june 30 resorts has pulled in 977 million in gross 
gaming revenues an 119 percent drop from the first six months of 
1989 
the company recorded a 31 million loss for the first quarter 
of 1990 on overall operating revenues of 1076 million resorts 
had a loss of 187 million in the first quarter of 1989 on overall 
operating revenues of 1135 million

the 1990 farm bill sent to the senate by its 
agriculture committee is surviving major changes 
the senate was debating an amendment today that would reduce 
guarantees to sugar producers from 18 cents a pound to 16 cents 
the house meanwhile faced more than 100 amendments in taking 
up its version of the bill today 
on monday the senate defeated an amendment that would have made 
significant changes in the section on sustainable agriculture 
that system of farming the seeks reduction in chemical use 
the proposal offered by sen charles grassley riowa would 
have weakened a provision was meant to enhance government 
activities to encourage sustainable agriculture it was defeated 
6032 
the senate defeated 6229 an amendment by sen harry reid 
dnev to discontinue use of animals for acute toxicity testing in 
product safety experiments 
opponents said the measure said it was a commerce committee 
problem that should make its way to the floor through that panel 
not as an addition to the farm bill 
the senate approved amendments that would 
authorize 250000 to study the effects of timber harvesting 
and deforestation in the new york and new jersey highlands 
make wood products eligible for agricultural export programs 
require that the agriculture department phase in changes in 
research programs so that by 1993 the agricultural research 
service is spending 20 percent of its budget on alternative crops 
and products the bill authorizes 730 million annually for the 
service during the fiveyear life of the bill 
sen tom daschle dsd criticized the agriculture department 
as oriented too much toward increasing crop yields 
we produce so much we dont know what to do with it sen 
john glenn dohio said in support of the amendment this says 
we want to channel some of this research into nonfood uses 
products that are under development now include using corn as a 
substitute for road salt soybean oil as a pesticide carrier and 
corn and wheat starches to make products biodegradable

sales in all major markets particularly europe

pounds or 148 million in the same period a year ago 
sales gained 26 percent to 6883 million pounds or 12 billion

a scary drop in stock prices has resurrected 
memories of market instability and suddenly cast doubt on the 
ability of the dow jones average to decisively crack the 3000 
barrier 
but investment strategists say elements that caused the price 
tumble monday had been building for awhile many said they didnt 
presage any significant bailout from the stock market unless 
theres some unforeseen economic calamity 
were at or slightly below the levels where we closed at the 
end of june said david edington a portfolio manager at pacific 
investment management co in newport beach calif 
the dow average the most widely watched barometer of the 
markets direction dropped more than 100 points early monday and 
sent shock waves throughout the financial markets but the index 
regained half the loss by the end of the day and closed down 5644 
points at 290470 
still it was the biggest oneday point loss for the average in 
six months and a sharp turnaround in psychology from last week 
when the dow average neared closing above the 3000 mark for the 
first time 
trading was tentative when the market opened today amid 
expectations of continued volatility the dow was up 570 at 
291040 in the first half hour of dealing as investors searched 
for bargains in the wake of mondays selloff 
equities markets overseas appeared to have a mixed response to 
wall streets monday decline japans 225share nikkei stock 
average fell 19233 points today losing 060 percent to close at 
3170246 following a 52672point loss on monday 
but in london stocks were higher around midday as cashrich 
institutions took advantage of cheaper prices created by mondays 
drop in new york at about noon local time the financial 
timesstock exchange 100share index was up 116 points or 05 
percent at 23713 
lawrence helfand a senior strategist with the rodman amp renshaw 
investment firm in chicago said he had been expecting a 
correction i anticipate mondays drop is part of that 
correction theres lots of negative news around with no real 
reason to anticipate any positive news 
broader measurements of the stock market also dropped monday for 
reasons ranging from from a rash of disappointing corporate 
earnings to revived fears of higher interest rates to continued 
anxiety over the federal deficit 
many strategists also called the drop a classic wall street 
symptom known as blue monday the tendency for prices to fall 
right after weekends in this case the excuse to sell was 
aggravated by the markets sudden weakness late friday 
its the kind of shakeout weve had before said robert 
farrell chief market analyst for merrill lynch amp co in new york 
i dont think its the start of a really big decline 
many attributed the volatility in stocks to the use of 
highvolume computerized strategies known as program trading which 
critics say can severely exaggerate price movements 
the dow drop helped cause a similar decline in the stockindex 
futures market where traders bet on the direction of stock prices 
by buying and selling contracts based on market indexes the 
futures drop activated a circuit breaker that briefly halted 
trading in the standard amp poors stockindex contract 
the new york stock exchange also requested voluntary compliance 
with its proposed ban on computerized selling tactics in a falling 
market 
the circuit breakers were put in place to forestall a collapse 
like that of black monday oct 19 1987 the nyse proposal for 
voluntary program trading halts has been awaiting federal 
regulatory approval for several months 
it was unclear what effect the nyses request had monday but 
sharon gamsin spokeswoman for the nations largest stock market 
said by and large it appears there was compliance 
although the dow average is the most widely recognized yardstick 
of the stock market it had recently surged ahead of broader more 
important measurements of the stock markets health therefore 
many strategists werent surprised by the size of the averages 
drop 
the market is sick and its been camouflaged by the phobia for 
3000 said stan weinstein a widely followed strategist who 
publishes the investor newsletter professional tape reader he 
accurately forecasted the 1987 plunge 
im not telling you you have to have a crash weinstein 
said im just saying when you have this kind of stuff the 
caution flags are flying

wages salaries and other benefits paid to 
american workers shot up 52 percent in the 12 months ending in 
june the government reported today 
the labor department said its employment cost index considered 
one of the best gauges of inflationary wage pressures was pushed 
ahead both by rising wage costs and higher benefit costs 
the 52 percent jump was well above the 45 percent increase of 
a year ago for the 12month period ending june 1989 the department 
said 
todays report was sure to add to analysts worries that the 
nation is suffering from entrenched inflation last week the 
government reported that consumer inflation has risen 59 percent 
so far this year well above the 46 percent inflation rate for all 
of last year 
in another sign of higher wage pressures the labor department 
said today that major collective settlements reached so far this 
year provided average wage increases of 38 percent over the life 
of the pacts up from a 25 percent average increase the last time 
those contracts were negotiated 
allen sinai chief economist at the boston co called the 
governments data on rising labor costs more of the same story on 
inflation 
the message is that there is no relief in sight it is 
stable but stable at a high and entrenched rate sinai said 
following the bad news on inflation last week analysts said it 
was unlikely the federal reserve would be able to stray any time 
soon from its inflationfighting campaign and lower interest rates 
the 52 percent rise in the cost index for private industry 
workers covered total compensation which includes wages salaries 
and the employer costs of providing such benefits as health 
insurance 
the wage and salary component of the index climbed by 45 
percent in the 12 months ending in june while benefit costs rose a 
sharper 69 percent 
part of the jump in wages and salaries reflected the rise in the 
minimum wage that took effect april 1 when the minimum wage went 
from 335 an hour to 380 an hour the labor department said 
however the impact of that increase the first rise in the 
minimum wage in 10 years was probably minimal the agency said 
workers in the service sector of the economy fared better than 
the manufacturing sector in pay gains the government said 
service industries saw wages and salaries go up by 46 percent 
in the past 12 months compared to a 42 percent rise for the 
manufacturing sector 
in part that gain reflects the fact that service industries 
have been more affected by shortages of workers in the past year 
however there was a wide fluctuation in both the services and 
manufacturing categories wage increases ranged from 23 percent in 
transportation to 63 percent in health services in the service 
industry while pay gains ranged from 29 percent in construction 
to 48 percent in nondurables manufacturing 
nonunion workers received better wage gains than their union 
counterparts continuing a trend thats been ongoing since 198384 
the government said nonunion workers pay rose 48 percent while 
union workers saw gains of 33 percent 
the 52 percent increase in total compensation for private 
industry over the 12 months ending in june matched the 52 percent 
rise in the 12 months ending in march 
the 45 percent rise in wages and salaries was faster than the 
41 percent increase from a year ago and the 42 percent increase 
for the year ending in march 
the 69 percent jump in benefit costs was down slightly from the 
72 percent increase for the 12month period ending in march but 
well above the 56 percent increase of a year ago 
pressures of wage inflation have intensified every quarter since 
june of 1988 when the employment cost index rose above the 4 
percent level for the first time 
in part analysts blame rising wage and benefit costs on a tight 
labor market that is forcing employers to spend more to recruit and 
keep workers

reporter she asked adding that no prearrangements were 
attached to metzenbaums comments

invested 100000 with a federal regulator paul g heafy who also 
was involved in thompsons negotiations to buy an insolvent bank in

president bush and congressional leaders met 
for two hours today in hopes of spurring a deficitreduction 
compromise but a top house negotiator later said fundamental 
disagreements remain 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo also said that 
president bushs recent attacks on congressional democrats at 
republican fundraising events arent helping the process of 
finding a compromise 
one of the things discussed today was to stop the political 
debate and start the substantive debate and to try to cut down on 
the political comment thats gone on on all sides gephardt told 
reporters outside the white house 
bush himself seemed downbeat refusing to answer questions at a 
picturetaking session at the start of todays meeting dont 
even try im in a bad mood today bush told reporters he did 
not elaborate 
bush has been lashing out at democrats and the congressional 
budget process in a series of gop fundraising speeches in fact 
he was attending similar events today in philadelphia and new york 
gephardt said that bush had agreed to cool down his attacks and 
i think youre going to see that happen 
flying to philadelphia aboard air force one white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said bush would be very gentle 
toward the democrats in his campaign speeches 
theyre working in a spirit of harmony and compromise in 
fact they agreed this morning at the meeting that they would try 
to keep the rhetoric under control and really try to make this a 
productive week of work fitzwater said 
gephardt who is the leader of the budget summit 
negotiations when bush is not present said he still thought it 
possible that accord could be reached by early august when 
congress begins its summer recess 
but i dont know for absolute sure that we can do that he 
added it may be that we cant get all of it done but were 
going to give it the good old college try 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said decisions remain to 
be made on the precise amount of deficit reduction that would be 
sought and how much of the savings would come from new taxes and 
spending cuts bargainers have said they expect any compromise to 
contain about 50 billion in savings divided in half between 
revenues and spending reductions 
i dont think there is at this point a clear definition of 
what each side wants foley told reporters 
gephardt said budget negotiators would meet again on capitol 
hill later today he said a smaller group including top house and 
senate leaders and the president would meet again at the white 
house on wednesday morning 
well try to work both groups together as we try to work 
toward a solution of the problem he said there are still some 
very difficult areas of discussion that will be hard to close on 
this is not easy to do 
there are fundamental disagreements on taxes spending cuts 
in entitlement programs and on defense spending levels the 
democratic leader added 
gephardt said the president did not offer any specific proposals 
on new taxes at todays session 
the oval office session also included senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
and house minority leader bob michel rill 
after 11 weeks of bargaining there is still very little 
agreement on specifics gephardt conceded 
the two sides have made no decisions about where they will find 
50 billion in new taxes and spending cuts for fiscal 1991 which 
starts oct 1 
bush met with congressional leaders last wednesday in hopes of 
advancing the negotiations but since then the two sides have done 
little but argue 
the houses 176 minority republicans voted informally that same 
day to oppose any tax increases as part of a budgetcutting 
package democrats said that vote hurt the talks by casting doubt 
on whether gop lawmakers would eventually support a compromise 
negotiators met last thursday but spent the closeddoor meeting 
yelling at each other participants said and friday on a western 
campaign trip bush accused congressional democrats of causing the 
recent run of 150 billion a yearplus budget shortfalls prompting 
democrats to fire back 
the budget negotiators hope to produce a package within the next 
two or three weeks when congress august recess begins but 
bargainers concede it will be hard to accomplish that goal

aerospace manufacturer mcdonnell douglas

the case stems from a june 20 1989 accident at a cape 
canaveral launch pad in which a 65pound crane hook crashed into an 
80 million communications satellite on a delta rocket 
the satellite was insured by lloyds and the manufacturer 
repaired it at an estimated cost of 10 million the insurance 
group wants to recover part og the costs 
the suit alleges that mcdonnell and employees of its space 
operations unit negligently and carelessly planned simulated 
trained for and conducted the handling and removal procedure in a 
way that caused the crane cable to snap while loading the satellite 
it accuses mcdonnell employees of reckless wanton and gross 
negligence in violating statutes and industry standards for 
operation of an overhead crane 
the suit was filed last month in brevard county circuit court 
and mcdonnell has petitioned for its transfer to federal court 
because the accident occurred on us government property 
the case is the second in the commercial space launch industry 
in a month 
martin marietta corp and the international telecommunications 
satellite oraganization went to court earlier this month to decide 
who should pay for a satellite launch failure in march 
a martin mariettabuilt titan 4 rocket failed to boost the 157 
million intelsat satellite into the proper orbit

secondquarter declines of 26 percent in 
profits and 10 percent in sales were reported tuesday by the 
weyerhaeuser co with the pulp and paper markets blamed for most 
of the slump 
a statement issued by the forest products corporation said net

or 54 cents a share on 24 billion in net sales down from 1549 
million or 73 cents a share on 26 billion in sales for the

net earnings fell from 3029 million or 143 a share to 2443 
million or 115 a share a 19 percent decline 
company chairman george h weyerhaeuser said the biggest factor 
in the secondquarter drop was a 40 percent decline in earnings on 
pulp and paper products over the past year 
the pulp division was hit by maintenance work that cut 
production at a time of soft markets and prices were weak in the 
paper division until a recent upward turn weuerhaeuser said 
forest products results were flat as a decline in export volumes 
and lower prices for western products were offset by stronger sales 
of southern lumber and plywood and better results for engineered 
fiber panels 
real estate earnings slumped largely because of weak markets in 
baltimore southern california and florida while a reorganization 
of financial services brought gains in mortgage and insurance 
subsidiaries the statement said 
a corporate structural review will be completed in the third 
quarter with reorganization and improvement plans for lumber and 
plywood to begin taking effect in september weyerhaeuser said

insurance to defense gear to sheraton hotels said it earned 397 
million or 3 a share in the three months that ended june 30 vs 
244 million or 170 a share in the comparable period a year 
earlier 
revenue totaled 52 billion unchanged from a year earlier the 
company attributed the lack of growth to divestures in 1989 as well 
as flat revenues by its insurance and automotivecomponents 
businesses 
itt said the secondquarter earnings were enlarged from the sale 
of a 7 percent stake of alcatel nv of france to compagnie generale 
delectricite in june which resulted in an aftertax gain of 139 
million 
itt retains a 30 percent interest in alcatel one of the biggest 
telecommunications equipment concerns 
the 1989 secondquarter earnings figures included a 18 million 
gain on the sale of itts european headquarters as well as a 28 
million decline to reflect the cost of itts investment in thompson 
mckinnon inc a failed wall street investment firm 
excluding these extraordinary items and the alcatel gain 
secondquarter earnings were only marginally higher 
still the results were better than expected considering the 
weakness in some of itts most important businesses insurance 
defense and hotels the companys stock price rose 625 cents a 
share to 5737 tuesday on the new york stock exchange 
itt said earnings fell at its defense electronic components 
financial and hotel units but remained sound or strengthened in the 
automotive fluid technology and pulptimber businesses itts 
insurance business also improved from higher investment income and 
life insurance operations which offset weakness in casualty 
underwriting the company said 
for the first half of the year earnings totaled 650 million or 
488 a share a 46 percent increase over the 444 million or 310 
a share earned in the first half of 1989 revenues totaled 102 
billion vs 10 billion a 2 percent gain

soybean futures prices resumed their slide tuesday on the 
chicago board of trade as many traders who had cashed out of the 
market in the previous session became sellers again amid forecasts 
for good growing weather 
most corn futures also retreated while wheat futures advanced on 
expectations for new export sales of the grain 
on other commodity markets crude oil futures rose livestock 
and meat futures were mostly higher and precious metals fell 
soybean futures settled 8 cents lower to 2 cents higher in 
chicago with the contract for delivery in august at 584 a bushel 
wheat finished 1 cent to 1 cents higher with september at 
303 a bushel corn was 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher with 
september at 261 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents higher 
with september at 128 a bushel 
bullish chart signals in the soybean market were eclipsed by a 
national weather service forecast that predicted normal 
temperatures and abovenormal rainfall in the midwest during the 
first half of next week 
the outlook for a continuation of nearperfect growing 
conditions brought back into the market traders who had evened up 
their books monday said victor lespinasse an assistant vice 
president in the grain trading division of dean witter reynolds inc 
the weather remains the main bearish influence he said 
the bias was generally toward the downside and thats the way we 
ended 
selling interest was tempered though by concerns about the 
slow pace at which the soybean and corn crops are developing a 
function of heavy spring rains that delayed planting 
a weekly agriculture department report released late monday 
showed only 28 percent of the corn crop at the silking stage as of 
sunday compared with the average of 62 percent for that date 
the usda said 36 percent of the soybean crop was blooming 
compared with a 57 percent norm and 6 percent of soybeans were 
setting pods compared with the average of 20 percent 
lespinasse said fears are filtering into the market that an 
early frost could damage latematuring crops reducing the overall 
yields 
crude oil futures extended their gains on the new york 
mercantile exchange following reports that iraq was amassing troups 
on the kuwait border and threatening military action 
further support stemmed from a report that iraqi oil minister 
issam alchalabi will insist on a 25abarrel price for crude at 
the opec meeting thursday in geneva 
after the close the american petroleum institute released its 
weekly stocks report which showed us supply levels of crude and 
refined products to be in line with expectations 
crude oil stocks declined 16 million barrels gasoline stocks 
rose 672000 barrels and supplies of petroleum distillates rose 24 
million barrels the api reported 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents lower to 14 
cents higher with september at 2056 a barrel heating oil was 39 
cent to 82 cent higher with august at 5732 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 14 cent lower to 60 cent higher with august 
at 6328 cents a gallon 
pork belly futures staged a dramatic turnaround on the chicago 
mercantile exchange rising the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a 
pound after posting limit losses in three of the four previous 
sessions 
analysts attributed much of the buying to strength in the cash 
belly market which boosted prices of fresh pork bellies over 
frozen bellies for the first time in several days 
live cattle settled 23 cent to 73 cent higher with august at 
7685 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 107 cents

slack demand

opec ministers tuesday began gathering for a 
critical strategy session that has been overshadowed by iraqi 
threats to punish cartel members that exceed their oil production 
limits 
the meeting is taking place as oil prices continue a rebound 
from lows of earlier this year that served to aggravate the 
political tensions raised by iraq especially against neighboring 
cartel member kuwait 
a number of ministers expressed support for increasing the 
cartels benchmark price for its crude from the current 18 a 
barrel which would require agreement on new production limits 
but ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries sidestepped the confrontation between iraq and kuwait 
we are here to solve oil problems said saudi arabias 
influential oil minister hisham nazer as he arrived for the 
midyear meeting scheduled for thursday 
iraqs oil minister issam abdul raheem alchalabi was 
surrounded by dozens of reporters as he entered the lobby of a 
luxury hotel where the talks are held he only discussed his plans 
to press for an increase in the current 18 a barrel benchmark 
price for the cartels crude oil 
the cartels discussions have taken on added significance since 
iraqi president saddam hussein last week threatened to use force 
against countries that exceed their opecset production quotas 
his remarks were aimed at kuwait and the united arab emirates 
two gulf producers that have violated their output ceilings 
saddam claimed his debtridden country has lost 14 billion 
during the past year because of a world oil glut that sent crude 
prices tumbling iraq also has charged that kuwait stole 24 
billion worth of iraqi oil since 1980 from wells it dug on iraqi 
territory across their common border 
iraq reportedly has moved 30000 troops to its border with 
kuwait and battlefield missiles armored personnel carriers and 
tanks were displayed prominently along the road from iraq to kuwait 
the united states on tuesday expressed concern with the buildup 
and confirmed its naval forces were holding a joint exercise in the 
persian gulf with the united arab emirates 
the iraqi threats were made a week after saudi arabia and four 
other gulf producers proposed an accord designed to halt the 
runaway production of kuwait and the united arab emirates 
nazer told reporters he was confident opec would reach an 
agreement along the lines of the gulf proposal that plan would 
limit the cartels production to about 225 million barrels a day 
in the next few months 
the cartels cap for the first half of the year was 221 million 
barrels however a confidential report prepared by opecs 
secretariat in vienna put actual production at 235 million barrels 
a day in the apriljune quarter according to sources familiar with 
the document 
demand for the cartels oil was estimated at 218 million 
barrels a day in the third quarter of this year rising to 244 
million barrels in the last three months of the year said the 
sources who demanded anonymity 
the opec market report said an overall production ceiling of 22 
million barrels a day in the second half of the year would improve 
prices considerably 
opecs excess production sent prices tumbling in the spring 
the average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by the 
cartel plummeted to 1364 a barrel in june before climbing to 
1625 a barrel last week 
the september contract for the benchmark us crude finished at 
2056 a barrel late tuesday on the new york mercantile exchange 
up 6 cents from monday and up about 5 from its lows in june 
iran has proposed a reference price of 20 a barrel while iraq 
wants a 25 level nazer said saudi arabia supported a price hike 
but he did not mention a figure 
iraqs chalabi said his country was aiming for 25 and gabons 
jean ping said he would like to see the target raised above 18 
under the gulf proposal kuwait and the united arab emirates 
each would limit output to 15 million barrels a day the two 
separately have been pumping as much as 2 million barrels a day 
kuwaits current production cap is 15 million barrels a day 
and the uae quota is 11 million barrels 
while the cartels official summer meeting opens thursday its 
eightmember monitoring panel will hold talks wednesday 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

mcdonalds corp and wendys international announced monday they 
are switching to cholesterolfree allvegetable oil to cook their 
french fries 
in april anticholesterol crusader phil sokolof placed ads in 
newspapers criticizing mcdonalds and other restaurants for cooking 
fries in beef tallow rather than using hearthealthy oils 
here is a brief explanation of fats 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
all dietary fats are mixtures of three kinds of fatty acids 
saturated monosaturated and polyunsaturated 
according to some studies the relative health merits of 
different oils and fats are determined by the proportions of each 
of the three different kinds of fatty acids in the individual oil 
or fat 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
fats with a higher proportion of saturated fatty acids are 
generally solid at room temperature research indicates they 
increase blood cholesterol 
animal fats have a higher proportion of saturated fatty acids 
than most fats from plants animal fats also contain cholesterol 
tropical oils are derived from plants and therefore contain no 
cholesterol however they are high in saturated fatty acids some 
tropical oils such as palm oil coconut oil and palm kernel oil 
actually have more saturated fatty acids than the animal fats 
hydrogenated fats are other fats of plant origin that have been 
processed or hydrogenated and have become saturated fats the 
degree of saturation is dependent on the processing but generally 
the harder the product is at room temperature the more saturated 
it is examples of hydrogenated products are hard shortenings hard 
or stick margarines and some kinds of peanut butter 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
fats with a high proportion of monosaturated fatty acids do not 
increase blood cholesterol studies suggest the monosaturates 
particularly olive oil actually reduce blood cholesterol levels 
monosaturated fats include olive oil peanut oil and avocado oil 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
fats with a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids are 
found primarily in plants and in some kinds of fish 
polyunsaturates reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering 
cholesterol levels in the blood polyunsaturates include sunflower 
oil corn oil soybean oil cottonseed oil safflower oil and some 
fish oils

administration officials said tuesday they had 
scrapped the idea of turning over the troubled portfolio of the 
nations largest guarantor of college student loans to a much 
smaller nebraska program 
the officials said the department of education is exploring 
other options including the possibility of finding another agency 
to take over the strained higher education assistance foundation 
the foundation informed the government it is having serious 
problems meeting its obligations to insure nearly 300 million in 
defaulted student loans for fiscal year 1990 
the foundations troubles have raised doubts that it can ensure 
the availability of new loans service its outstanding debt and pay 
on default claims 
were looking at a range of alternatives whereby another 
entity or entities insure all of those functions either on a 
shortor longterm basis said education undersecretary ted 
stevens 
under the scenario that im talking about here heaf would not 
exist he added during a press briefing 
were trying to get to a point of a friendly takeover by a 
stronger guarantor said an official from the office of 
management and budget who requested anonymity 
in a written statement heaf said it was pursuing on its own 
additional options that would enable us to restore confidence to 
its loan guarantees as the peak activity season begins 
however the foundation said it is best that we not speculate 
on how these problems might be resolved or who might be involved 
the omb official identified the united students aids funds in 
indianapolis ind as one possible candidate to take over heaf 
but a proposed merger agreement that would have transferred many 
of heafs loan default obligations to the nebraska student loan 
program inc apparently has been abandoned 
the department determined that the nebraska program would have 
been unable to manage a portfolio the size of heafs it also said 
such a merger would offer only a shortterm remedy and might have 
circumvented the law 
heaf was the nations largest guarantor of student loans last 
year with 96 billion in loans outstanding the outstanding loan 
program of the nebraska program is just under 500 million 
under the merger agreement the federal government would have 
footed the bill for heafs fiscal year 1990 default obligations and 
the foundation would have been allowed to start anew on oct 1 the 
beginning of the 1991 fiscal year 
through the governments guaranteed student loan program 55 
guarantors including heaf insure 100 percent of student loans to 
banks or secondary lenders 
the education department reinsures the loans and reimburses the 
guarantor agency for payments to lenders the reimbursement rates 
begin at 100 percent but drop to 90 percent when reinsurance 
payments exceed five percent when the payments reach 9 percent the 
rate falls to 80 percent 
heaf is the only guarantor to reach the 9 percent level 
dropping the governments repayment rate to 80 percent in april 
heaf has guaranteed billions in trade school loans with high 
default rates such loans accounted for 59 percent of heafs 1988 
portfolio but only 35 percent in 1989 
officials also sought to assure students lenders and other 
agencies that heafs problems do not signal systemwide problems 
for the student loan program 
this situation will not affect the ability of students to 
obtain loans of lenders to make those loans or of guarantors to 
insure those loans education secretary lauro cavazos said 
officials said heafs problems are serious but are isolated to 
that organization 
however education officials said the government is not 
obligated to pay lenders in event of insurance defaults by heaf or 
other guarantors in the event of student loan defaults 
the omb official dismissed temptations to compare problems in 
the student loan program with the multibillion dollar savings and 
loan crisis 
this is not a big federal bailout this is not a federal 
bailout period he said the numbers are big but it is not an 
sampltype situation 
a ninemember education department review team and two 
highranking omb officials were sent monday to heaf offices in st
