firefighters declared a temporary victory friday in their battle 
to keep a forest fire out of a small montana town and forest 
officials warned that more lightning and dry hot weather were 
forecast this weekend 
its like sitting on a time bomb said scott phillips 
recreation officer for the sawtooth national recreation area in 
central idaho if we can get through this weekend without a 
conflagration it will be a miracle 
forests and rangeland burned friday in parts of wyoming 
especially in yellowstone national park and in idaho montana 
oregon washington utah and california 
the boise interagency fire center the logistics command for the 
national battle against forest fires reported more than 25000 
firefighters military and support personnel on the lines of more 
than three dozen major fires in the west 
fire center spokesman arnold hartigan called it the most 
severe fire season in almost 30 years more than 35 million 
acres have burned twothirds of that in alaska and suppression 
costs already exceed 250 million 
the fire season is anything but over the 30day weather 
forecast calls for continued unseasonably hot and dry weather for 
the pacific northwest and northern rockies hartigan said record 
highs were forecast during the weekend in oregon and washington 
with a threat of lightning 
forest service officials asked people to stay out of forests in 
central montana and restrictions on such things as open campfires 
were tightened in idaho and washington many forests in oregon were 
closed to recreational use 
logging activity was shut down statewide in washington on 
public and private land because of fire concern the weyerhaeuser 
co closed all its timberlands to public access until further 
notice 
the focus of attention friday in and around yellowstone where 
some 550000 acres have been charred was the small town of west 
yellowstone mont just outside the parks west entrance it was 
threatened by flames just over a mile away that were spreading from 
the 118000acre north fork fire inside the park that had grown by 
nearly 10000 acres since thursday morning 
bulldozers helicopters and back fires stalled the advance of 
the fire friday but gusty winds swept a swath of flame south of 
the town and a wind change predicted for monday raised concerns the 
blaze could move back toward the community 
in my judgment this community is very defensible denny 
bungartz the north fork fires incident commander told about 60 
townspeople 
he said firetrucks had pumped 5000 gallons of water into dry 
brush around a warehouse at the park boundary and 50 fire engines 
would be in town during the night to hose down buildings if 
necessary 
to the east and north of town the madison river formed a 
natural fire break firefighters improved on that barrier by 
bulldozing fire lines and lighting backfires exhausting the 
forests fuel before the main fire could reach the river as 
helicopters dropped water on the area 
residents of the small town with a yearround population of 
750 prepared to evacuate but most stayed put friday most of the 
people leaving town were tourists who decided to spend their labor 
day weekend somewhere less smoky 
curious onlookers filled the streets friday as afternoon winds 
blew away the smoky haze 
im packed up and ready to go said david powell owner of a 
hamburger stand downtown i left la because i couldnt stand the 
smog i dont like this stuff 
some people were driving in the other direction because west 
yellowstone will play host to hundreds of square dancers this 
weekend for the knothead jamboree resident dance caller orvile 
pittam says its been sponsored by square dance groups in utah 
idaho wyoming and montana every labor day weekend for 37 years and 
attracts up to 800 people 
ken takata west yellowstone chamber of commerce president said 
that while there have been some cancellations because of the fires 
its too early to tell what the overall effect will be 
we want people to know that right now conditions are pretty 
good he said friday weve had some bad press that west 
yellowstone is being evacuated and thats just not the case we 
hope it will be business as usual 
elsewhere in yellowstone the clover mist fire had covered 
232400 acres after growing 1000 acres in 24 hours the snake 
river complex of fires was stable at about 156500 acres and the 
wolf lake fire grew slightly to 40500 acres said fire information 
officer brian morris 
north of yellowstone in southcentral montana firefighters in 
the absarokabeartooth wilderness changed their tactics friday on a 
49800acre wilderness fire that jumped fire lines four days in a 
row 
fire information officer chris comstock said friday that 
officals changed their strategy from building fire lines to setting 
backfires because our method of approach right now hasnt been 
effective in catching this fire 
fire bosses in idaho used a second day of light wind to gain 
more ground against the worst of idahos 17 wildfires with more 
than 3000 firefighter and support personnel still battling fires 
that had burned more than 75000 acres 
only the 40300acre tepee butte fire remained out of control in 
oregon in the wallowawhitman national forest and the hells 
canyon national recreation area it was 25 percent contained 
friday officials said 
by friday fires that raged through tinderdry california 
forests were dying down with all reported contained or under 
control 
a new forest fire near salt lake city forced the evacuation of a 
few homes on friday the states largest fire was a 2000acre 
blaze fanned by ridgetop winds near northern utahs pineview 
reservoir 
the fire was initially declared under control late tuesday at 
525 acres but roared to life again late wednesday when gusts fanned 
hot spots and pushed flames over fire lines

year immediately 
clark said was berube was pleased with the settlement but would 
rather have had his job back in washington someone else has the 
job now and berube opted to settle rather than go through 
additional years of litigation for berube to regain the position 
clark said

to five the government accounting project which championed 
berubes case a check for 530000 to settle the dispute the

at the time of his firing berube oversaw 7000 employees in the 
washington area and a budget of 2 billion he was in charge of 
maintaining virtually every government building in washington 
berube was dismissed after he alleged that many federal 
buildings in washington posed serious fire and health hazards and 
that maintenance was deferred to save money

hurricane debby lashed this gulf of mexico 
port city friday with heavy rain and winds gusting up to 74 mph 
knocking out power flooding streets and forcing some people to 
flee their homes 
but the first hurricane of the 1988 atlantic season began 
weakening shortly after hitting the coast and was downgraded to a 
tropical storm 
the national weather service in mexico city said debby moved 
inland at tuxpan a city of 120000 about 165 miles northeast of 
mexico city at 4 pm 6 pm edt it said at that time the storm 
was carrying winds up to 74 mph the minimum strength to be 
classified as a hurricane 
the service downgraded debby to tropicalstorm status after its 
center stalled on reaching the eastern sierra madre mountain range 
50 miles inland about 730 pm with maximum winds of 49 mph 
heavy rains were falling in parts of veracruz and tamaulipas states 
we can say the storm is becoming disorganized a weather 
service spokesman said by morning maximum winds should be around 
30 mph and the storm should disappear by saturday night 
the storm caused power outages in tuxpan and poza rica about 20 
miles to the south and dozens of people were evacuated from 
lowlying areas in the two cities and near the tuxpan and tecolutla 
rivers 
the rains have calmed somewhat but the winds are strong 
said red cross worker francisco javier cruz balderas many 
streets are inundated and the rivers are rising fast 
hundreds of people sought refuge in schools and municipal 
offices in alamo a coffeeproducing town about 20 miles west of 
tuxpan said roberto martinez editor of the newspaper el mundo of 
tampico 
dozens of residents had to be rescued from cars and flooded 
homes in poza rica a city of 300000 authorities closed streets 
in some sections of the city because of flooding 
the situation is bad enough but not desperate said red 
cross spokesman alan garcia in poza rica 
a lot of trash in the streets and tree trunks are blocking 
runoff he said even we cant get out were trapped 
he said several dozen residents of lowlying areas in the city 
were evacuated to higher ground but he couldnt give a figure as to 
how many people were affected 
martinez said there were power outages throughout the northern 
veracruz coastline and that some local roads were cut off by 
flooding residents of tampico and other cities in southern 
tamaulipas state were bracing for heavy rains he said 
there was a lot of panic buying in supermarkets here but so 
far there havent been any problems martinez said 
guadalupe lopez a spokeswoman with the veracruz state 
government in jalapa said she could provide no figures on how many 
people were affected by the storm and that officials had no 
estimate of damages there were no reports of deaths or injuries 
she said 
although the national weather services in miami and mexico city 
said debby was carrying winds of 74 mph the mexican navy station 
and port authority in tuxpan said it did not have hurricane 
strength 
navy capt domingo rojas cadenas said his reports showed debby 
carrying winds of 50 mph and gusts of up to 62 mph when it reached 
tuxpan there is heavy rain now he said late friday but the 
storm had not caused any major problems 
debby grew from a depression into a tropical storm early friday 
and then quickly gathered strength becoming a hurricane by 
afternoon when it was just off the coast 
it was the first hurricane of the 1988 atlantic hurricane season 
and the fourth named storm

a sculpture garden where visitors touch 
climb on and lie down in statues worth millions of dollars attracts 
those who rarely visit museums 
the minneapolis sculpture garden being formally dedicated 
saturday is on 7 acres of downtown city parkland and is the 
largest urban sculpture garden in the country city and museum 
officials say 
it features a giant cherry in a spoon by claes oldenburg and 
sculptures by other such masters as isamu noguchi and henry moore 
i see children playing around and among the sculptures they 
become active participants like you probably couldnt have in a 
museum said david fisher superintendent of the minneapolis park 
and recreation board 
the 128 million joint project of walker art center the park 
board and the university of minnesotas landscape arboretum 
provides handson experience for adults too with its 40 
sculptures 
visitors who have been allowed in during the two years the 
project has been in development can swing on a platform suspended 
from the large steelbeamed sculpture arikidea by mark di 
suvero watching the beams overhead shift slowly from the motion of 
the swing 
they can lie on their backs in the aluminum human form that 
faces the sky and become part of peter sheltons 
blackvaultfalloffstone 
or they can step inside meg websters glen a plantfilled 
earthen crater and enjoy the scents and colors of perennial plants 
and wildflowers 
the interaction has been one of the bigger things that weve 
pulled off fisher said to watch the pure joy of some people 
in their interactions has been a real delight to me 
the sculptures date from early in the century to the present 
and range in style from classical realism to elemental abstractism 
they were created by artists working in a variety of media 
including bronze stone and wood 
permanent installations represent such acknowledged masters as 
henry moore reuben nakian and isamu noguchi as well as leading 
contemporaries such as deborah butterfield ellsworth kelly and 
george segal 
the garden designed by edward larrabee barnes in association 
with landscape architect peter rotschild is largely symmetrical 
four 100footsquare plazas are separated by walkways lined with 
linden trees the more traditional sculptures are placed among the 
trees along the walkways with the larger constructions inside the 
plazas 
the gardens focal point is the 500000 fountain sculpture 
spoonbridge and cherry by claes oldenburg and coosje van 
brugggen 
the giant gray aluminum spoon holding a deep red bing cherry 
with a black stem arches from the reed and irislined shore to an 
island in a freeform pond giving off a glistening mist and adding 
a touch of fantasy to the garden 
the sage and john cowles conservatory is a series of three 
connected glass houses that feature permanent and seasonal 
horticultural displays 
one exhibit contains a dozen palm trees that rise nearly 60 feet 
high looming over frank gehrys 22foothigh sculpture standing 
glass fish which rises from a pool of white water lilies 
a footbridge designed by artist siah armajani spans city traffic 
to link the garden to loring park and the downtown area 
one of the major goals of the sculpture garden said walker art 
center director martin friedman is to develop an appreciative 
audience by making as much good work available as possible 
the garden is meant to attract art lovers as well as people who 
dont normally frequent museums friedman said he hopes it will 
help dispell the perception that a museum is a somewhat remote 
presence even a fortress of art

the guards at the us embassy on alert for 
suicide car bombers and other terrorists were perplexed this week 
when a pickup truck approached the iron gate with a pinkribboned 
camel peering from the rear 
they stopped the driver and shouted at him in arabic its 
forbidden its forbidden 
after a few minutes of negotiations the heavy gate swung open 
and in came jimmy carters camel an example of southern egypt 
hospitality 
the saga began the weekend of aug 17 when egyptian officials 
telephoned wealthy camel trader abdelwahab waguih and told him the 
former us president and his wife rosalynn would be visiting 
suburban cairos sprawling camel market 
the carters and seven relatives arrived aug 18 for a twoday 
private visit to cap an african tour a us embassy spokesman said 
mrs carter specifically selected the camel market for sightseeing 
along with the giza pyramids and the sphinx 
at the market in the suburb of imbaba traders noisily bargain 
to sell camels earlier bought from sudanese owners who trek with 
the animals for about 40 days across sudans desert before bringing 
them by train from southern egypt to imbaba once sold the animals 
are used as a beasts of burden or are slaughtered for meat 
waguih was instructed to show the carters around and give them a 
flavor of egyptian business 
but he also gave the carters two silver daggers a bunch of 
genuine sudanese camel whips and the 6yearold camel a pink 
ribbon tied around his neck worth between 560 and 740 
he said his giftgiving was typical of saeedi the 
hospitality shown by people from southern egypt 
his generosity went so far as wanting to honor his guests by 
slaughtering a sheep at carters feet a traditional moslem act of 
welcome but the american embassy people told me not to he 
said carter wouldnt like it 
although he accepted the huge animal carter told the embassy he 
couldnt take it home to plains ga and instead wanted to give it 
to sister emmanuelle a french nun who works with cairos garbage 
collectors the zabaleen 
nobody came to pick up the beast for 10 days and waguih said he 
became impatient 
i took it to the embassy in a van there were guards at the 
door but i dont care im not afraid he said recounting the 
monday incident at the embassy as he sat outside his office at the 
market with 10 relatives 
an embassy official signed a receipt for the camel and 
dispatched an egyptian employee with wagih to deliver it to 
almuqattam mountain where thousands of zabaleen live and where 
sister emmanuelle has set up a school a health center and a 
veterinary clinic 
the camel is now out of our hands said the embassy 
spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity its up to sister 
emmanuelle to decide what to do with it to sell it or have it 
slaughtered for meat 
the roman catholic nun had no comment except i still dont 
know the camels fate 
for the zabaleen accustomed to donkeys pigs and sheep the 
camel provided a spectacle but not much enthusiasm or appetite 
we arent used to eating camel meat in this area said yanni 
rizk a worker at the nearby cairo slaughterhouse explaining it is 
an area without camel butchers 
its a joke said sister juliana an egyptian nun who helps 
sister emmanuelle at her health center theyll probably sell it 
and put the money into the vet center otherwise the camel 
requires money for food and care and we have no place to keep it 
the beast meanwhile stands waiting in the vet center 
courtyard the pink ribbon still around its neck

the expatriate daughter of a near 
legendary hero assassinated 40 years ago is helping to unify vast 
but potentially chaotic antigovernment forces in burma 
aung san leader of burmas independence struggle was gunned 
down at the age of 32 before as many have suggested the world 
of workaday politicking he was about to enter could mar his image 
some media reports have compared his daughter aung san suu kyi 
with philippine president corazon aquino and benazir bhutto of 
pakistan women from nationally prominent families who led or lead 
opposition forces 
the 43yearold daughter last week drew crowds of up to 400000 
to hear her call for democracy after 26 years of authoritarian 
rule some diplomats and burmese analysts believe she will be only 
a transitional figure but one who could help unify disparate 
groups and prevent a plunge into anarchy 
aung sans daughter was thrust unwittingly into the political 
arena after coming to rangoon from her home in england in april to 
care for her ailing mother 
she saw all the commotion and turmoil the rioting and 
demonstrators getting killed said burmese emigre spokesman max 
mcgrath in london she must have been affected emotionally 
especially when demonstrators carried pictures of her father at the 
head of the procession 
in an interview with a british television network last week she 
said she had no plans for a new political party or an immediate 
blueprint for a future burma beyond an interim peoples 
consultative committee leading to democracy 
if her program sounded vague her presence stirred strong 
emotions 
its like if george washingtons son had come along in 1830 
and said id like to be president of the united stats it would 
have a certain ring to it says british burma expert robert h 
taylor 
like washington whose name aung san used to invoke the burmese 
leader fought for independence from britain sealing their vow to 
liberate burma in blood he and the socalled thirty comrades 
marched into their homeland during world war ii attacking first 
the allies and then the japanese 
contemporaries recall aung san as a compelling personality a 
sincere highly principled and simpleliving man who could mix 
easily with colleagues and then lapse into periods of brooding 
silence 
after the war he negotiated successfully with the british 
government for independence but months before it was granted the 
youthful handsome aung san and half a dozen other leaders were 
killed when assassins of a political opponent burst into a cabinet 
meeting with automatic rifles blazing his death on july 19 1947 
is still commemorated as martyrs day 
aung san suu kyi was barely 2 years old when her father died 
she was educated in burma and india where he mother served as 
ambassador from 1960 to 1967 
she obtained a bachelor of arts degree from oxford university in 
1967 worked at the united nations headquarters in new york and in 
1972 married michael aris an oxford professor and expert on 
tibetan culture and the himalayan region 
although she accompanied her husband on long research stints to 
bhutan nepal japan and other asian countries acquaintances say 
she did not pursue a career after marriage 
the demonstrations against a quarter century of oppressive rule 
ended the calm of her private life some burmese also called for 
the return of her brother aung san oo a 45yearold american 
citizen living in the united states 
despite the rousing welcome for aung san suu kyi i think 
people are beginning to have some questions about her said a 
western diplomat in rangoon shes really an expatriate with no 
political experience 
but in a bbc interview she countered this by saying i have 
never been away in my thoughts i have never been away from my 
country and my people in my heart also i have never been 
seperated from them 
she and her husband who is with her in rangoon along with their 
two sons regularly visited burma during the ne win period rather 
than an emigre opposition figure she was allowed to return home at 
the price of keeping an apolitical silence about conditions in her 
country burmese emigres say 
some burmese believe her marriage to a foreigner would not be 
well accepted by many in the inwardlooking nation 
it also is unclear whether she has any formal political 
ambitions although last week she appeared to be thinking about a 
future in burma 
the burmese people love my father very much and i think they 
are ready to support me because im my fathers daughter she 
said

days before he was shot to 
death in january 16yearold rabeh mahmoud told his family he 
wanted to give his life for the palestinian cause his sister 
sabah recalls 
mahmoud is one of 53 youths under age 18 who have been kille 
during the 8monthold palestinian uprising in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip they comprise about a fourth of the deaths 
from israeli army gunfire thousands of other youths have been 
wounded 
tv viewers worldwide have seen the young palestinian boys in 
kafiyeh headdresses throwing rocks at troops then running as 
soldiers respond with tear gas and bullets 
israeli military officials allege the youths are placed in the 
front lines of protests to generate world sympathy and portray 
israeli occupation troops as ruthless soldiers who do not hesitate 
to shoot children 
children are weapons in this war it is very sinister said 
col renaan gissin the armys deputy spokesman 
with children up front they palestinian leaders win either 
way whether our soldiers refrain from shooting because of strict 
orders to avoid hurting children or if they open fire the 
palestinians win the war for the media gissin said they make 
sure the picture of the dead child makes it to the papers 
but the youngsters encountered in refugee camps throwing rocks 
at soldiers not much older than themselves say they are the 
leaders of the revolt 
they have become known as the children of the stones after a 
poem by syrian writer nizar qabani the palestine liberation 
organization has made posters of youngsters holding firebombs 
palestinians call children who are killed martyrs not 
victims 
sabah mahmoud the sister of slain 16yearold rabeh says her 
father now is worried about about his 13yearold son who is often 
out in the streets with friends the father cries whenever soldiers 
pass their house she said 
when rabeh told my father he wanted to die for palestine we 
thought he was joking sabah said sitting below a goldframed 
portrait of her dead brother the only picture on the walls of the 
beitin village farmhouse not far from ramallah 
united nations casualty lists updated as of aug 12 show 202 
palestinians killed by israeli army gunfire of these 53 are 18 or 
younger with 18 under 16 years old and six who were below 14 
the youngest casualty listed by the un was a 9yearold girl 
but the army said she was killed by a rock thrown by a palestinian 
the army whose death figures differ only slightly from un ones 
does not give breakdowns by age 
the un count shows three other arab youths under 18 including 
a 12yearold were shot to death by jewish settlers a 14 and 
17yearold were beaten to death by troops the un says 
an official of an international relief organization speaking on 
conditoin of anonymity estimated at least 8000 youngster have 
been wounded by bullets beatings tear gas or rubber bullets 
israeli youths arent directly involved in the protests but 
they are among civilians injured by rocks and firebombs hurled at 
cars the army lists 312 such casualties but has no breakdown by 
age 
a jewish girl 15yearold tirza porat was shot to death 
accidentally by an armed escort in the west bank in april when a 
group of jewish hikers clashed with arab villagers police are 
investigating whether an 8yearold boy slain august 27 near haifa 
was killed by palestinians 
one reason palestinian youngsters are so involved in protests is 
demographic almost 50 percent of the population of the occupied 
territories is 17 or younger according to the west bank data 
project research foundation 
these are youngsters raised under the military rule israel has 
maintained over the west bank and gaza strip since the territories 
were captured from jordan and egypt in 1967 
analysts say the young have become radicalized and are rebelling 
against israel and the traditional leadership of their elders 
which failed to secure an independent state 
its a schoolyard revolution said bernard mills a un 
relief works agency official in the occupied gaza strip even 
before the uprising by march of 1987 if you were over 14 years 
old and hadnt been arrested by the israelis you hadnt got your 
school letter to put it in american terms 
young people 18 to 25 are emerging as the new generation of 
leaders and their younger siblings are followers and wouldbe 
successors military sources said 
like the americans of the 1960s who said dont trust anyone 
over 30 they are saying dont trust anyone over 25 gissin 
said 
the israeli army recently introduced plastic bullets in a move 
it says is intended to cut casualties the army says its soldiers 
have orders not to open fire at children but occupation rules 
consider those over age 14 accountable for their actions 
chris george an official of save the children an american 
relief organization said the army should respect childrens status 
as minors 
even if a kid is involved in a confrontation throwing a rock 
for example there is no justification for a wellequipped army to 
use lethal force george said

a federal judge has dismissed two 
multibilliondollar lawsuits filed against morton thiokol by a 
former engineer who warned against the disastrous launch of the 
space shuttle challenger a lawyer said thursday 
robert levin attorney for former rocket engineer roger 
boisjoly told ksltv that he learned thursday afternoon that us 
district judge david k winder had dismissed the 3 billion suits 
with prejudice meaning they cannot be refiled 
court documents were expected to be made public friday morning 
the judge had taken the matter under advisement in february 
following a hearing on the companys motion to quash the suits 
one of boisjolys suits had sought 1 billion for the deaths of 
the seven challenger crew members on jan 28 1986 and 1 million 
in compensatory damages for his own health and career 
boisjoly who this year won the scientific freedom and 
responsibility award from the american association for the 
advancement of science contended morton thiokol impugned his 
professional reputation after he and other engineers testified 
before a presidential commission investigating the challenger 
explosion the engineers testified that they had warned against 
launching the shuttle in the unusually cool weather 
his other lawsuit filed under the false claims act on behalf of 
us taxpayers sought 2075 billion and alleged that morton 
thiokol knowingly provided the national aeronautics and space 
administration with defective solid rocket motors 
morton thiokol spokesman rocky raab said the company had 
received no official notification of the decision 
but if in fact it does prove to be true it does vindicate 
what weve said all along it repudiates what the claims were about 
challenger that he boisjoly made he said 
most of all were just glad to see that its over with 
raab said 
company attorneys had said boisjolys assertion that he was 
defamed was based on office chatter 
it is just workplacerelated talk that goes on all the time 
attorney robert jordan told the judge during februarys hearing 
however levin accused company officials of having launched a 
campaign to defame the engineer through pamphlets and interviews 
not coffeeshop stuff 
in a may interview boisjoly said only after two years of 
therapy and the positive catharsis of giving lectures on the 
disaster was he able to stop blaming himself for the destruction of 
the shuttle and deaths of the astronauts 
boisjoly and several other morton thiokol engineers had argued 
the night before the launch that temperatures of 53 degrees 
fahrenheit or less could result in a failure of a rocket joint seal 
but after a second caucus with nasa officials boisjoly said 
company managers perceived pressure from nasa there was no 
other justification for the launch i felt the pressure others 
felt the pressure 
he took disability leave july 21 1986 and left the company for 
good two months later 
the rogers commission investigating the explosion later blamed 
the disaster on a leaking joint seal that allowed superhot gases to 
escape and ignite the shuttles external fuel tank

the chiffons and the orlons were female 
quartets organized in 1960 to sing pop songs the taffetas are 
four women organized in 1988 to sing 1950s pop songs at the 
offbroadway cherry lane theater 
the taffetas who pretend to be sisters remind one most closely 
of the lennon sisters of lawrence welk reknown bubbles even 
stream up behind the taffetas during their encore 
its an evening for smiling in the theater in their 
pastelcolored gowns with matching microphone cords and shoes the 
taffetas look like theyre going to make fun of the 50s they 
dont they dont comment on the songs or update arrangements 
theyre going for nostalgia in which the audience can look back 
with gentle bemused affection 
those who dont remember the 50s can view it like their 
parents antiquated photo album those who do can try to recall who 
originally sang the songs 
the taffetas stress naivete talking a lot about mom and their 
home town of muncie ind they sing like crystalized sugar only 
once digging with gusto into a lyric where the boys are 
that song was sung originally by connie francis the taffetas 
also draw extensively from patti page and teresa brewer mr 
sandman that was by the chordettes dedicated to the one i 
love the shirelles they dont choose only from female soloists 
and quartets cry was a johnnie ray hit and the ames brothers 
first enlightened the world about rag mop which the taffetas 
take at a stately tempo 
the singers are jody abrahams karen curlee melanie mitchell 
and tia speros pianist rick lewis drummer mike osrowitz and 
bassist alan rubin accompany the show was conceived by lewis and 
staged and choreographed by tina paul 
like the mixed quartet in offbroadways oil city symphony 
the taffetas take time to talk about their hobbies they arent as 
clever as the oil city four and their music isnt nearly as 
varied still an evening with the taffetas is a pleasant way 
as they used to say on your hit parade to stroll down memory

of being army informants the peasants have said

a simulated shuttle mission 
designed to test the discovery astronauts troubleshooting skills 
was halted just before a mock landing because of a reallife 
computer crash nasa officials said 
the five astronauts were preparing to end their 56hour mission 
thursday afternoon by simulating a shuttle landing with a flat tire 
when the computer shutdown cut the rehearsal short 
im sure theyll be looking at it to see why it went down but 
nobody here considers it to be a big problem that the simulation 
ended early said nasa johnson space center spokesman james 
hartsfield 
national aeronautics and space administration officials stressed 
that there was no problem with any kind of computer used in actual 
flight control 
in huntsville ala meanwhile engineers at marshall space 
flight center said thursdays fifth and final test of seals and 
joints on the space shuttle booster rocket lifted their confidence 
in parts redesigned after the challenger disaster 
based on all appearances the test was a complete success 
said jim thomas technical assistant to the manager of the solid 
rocket motor project 
the twominute static test firing with the booster segment 
anchored in a 25 million test stand put launchstyle pressure on 
the redesigned joints 
the seals are designed to keep internal hot gases inside the 
twin rockets that help kick shuttles into earth orbit the failure 
of a joint in one of challengers two boosters was blamed for the 
january 1986 explosion that killed all seven crew members 
before the computer crash at johnson space center officials 
said the discovery crew handled all the simulated problems posed 
to them during a dress rehearsal for their flight which is slated 
for late september or early october 
the 56hour mock mission began about an hour late tuesday 
morning because of an earlier problem with the shuttle simulator 
but other glitches faced by the discovery crew were intentional 
as commander rick hauck pilot richard covey and mission 
specialists david hilmers mike lounge and george nelson were 
placed in situations designed to test their ability to solve a 
multitude of problems that could encounter on an actual mission 
shortly after launch tuesday the astronauts were forced to 
alter their course and enter a low orbit after nasa trainers staged 
a main engine failure 
on wednesday nelson and lounge had to go outside the orbiter to 
fix a stuck tilttable needed to deploy a 100 million 
communications satellite that simulation was done in a water tank 
spokeswoman barbara selby said

investigators thursday found the flap 
indicator handle on a shattered boeing 727 in the wrong position 
but a federal safety official said it could have been jarred that 
way in the fiery crash which killed 13 people 
the handle which is located on the console between the pilot 
and the first officer indicates the position of the aircrafts 
wing flaps 
at a news conference thursday night national transportation 
safety board member lee dickinson said the handle on the delta air 
lines jet that crashed wednesday was found to be in the up 
position opposite where it should have been for a proper takeoff 
but he went on to say the handle could have been pushed into the 
wrong position by the impact or by a crew member during the planes 
evacuation 
delta flight 1141 went down as it tried to take off from 
dallasfort worth international airport en route to salt lake city 
with more than 100 people aboard most were able to escape the 
burning plane by crawling out of emergency exits or tornopen areas 
all 13 deaths were attributed to smoke inhalation according to 
the tarrant county medical examiners office with burns also 
listed in two instances 
one of the survivors robert coester 39 of the dallas suburb 
of carrollton said he was most troubled by his unsuccessful 
efforts to rescue passengers trapped in the back of the burning 
plane 
i tried to get the rear door open said coester who was 
hospitalized for smoke inhalation and first second and 
thirddegree burns there was a handle on the outside i got the 
door ajar but not enough for them to get out 
investigators found at least five bodies near that door after 
the flames were extinguished 
the same flight thursday from dallasfort worth to salt lake 
city was aborted when the pilot detected a problem with his plane 
most of the 102 passengers including six survivors of the crash 
wednesday left about two hours later on another plane delta 
officials said 
federal investigators determined that the flaps and slats aboard 
a northwest airlines md80 had not been properly set for takeoff 
when that plane crashed aug 16 1987 at detroit metropolitan 
airport killing 156 people 
dickinson cautioned that the ntsb investigation team had just 
begun to study positions of the delta aircrafts wings and slats 
ntsb investigators said none of the witnesses they interviewed 
who were on nearby planes could tell them the position of the 
airplanes flaps 
dickinson said investigators have not talked to the crew but 
hoped to interview first officer wilson kirkland on friday 
the ntsb official also said control tower personnel indicated 
the boeing 727 took off at an angle that was higher than normal 
control tower workers who watched the plane leaving told 
investigators the plane had a nose high attitude of 15 to 20 
degrees 
investigators assume that they meant that was higher than 
normal dickinson said 
earlier thursday dickinson told reporters the planes crew had 
another indication of trouble during takeoff a cockpit tape 
recording recovered from the plane showed that pilots had talked 
about an engine problem seconds before the jetliner crashed 
shortly after takeoff there was a sound apparently a 
warning a stall condition may be approaching dickinson said he 
said the sound came from the shaking of the stick a device 
similar to the steering wheel that automatically makes a sound when 
a problem develops 
this indicates the plane may be approaching a point where it 
wont be able to fly he said shortly after that there was 
some conversation about an engine problem 
but he stressed that the warning sound could have stemmed from 
something besides an engine problem he would not elaborate except 
to say in this case were talking about hydraulics 
every accident in its own way is unique said ntsb spokesman 
michael benson you have to start from the beginning put 
together a mosaic and slowly discover what went wrong 
on wednesday the 15yearold boeing 727 failed to gain 
sufficient altitude bounced three times on the runway and burst 
into flames 
at least 95 people aboard miraculously survived by clambering or 
being pulled through emergency doors or through cracks in the 
burning fuselage into the hazy sunshine 
why why did it happen thats the question we have to answer 
now delta spokesman bill berry said in atlanta deltas 
headquarters 
witnesses said there appeared to have been a fire or explosion 
in an engine on takeoff federal aviation administration spokesman 
jack barker said 
but that was not confirmed he said this was merely what 
some witnesses were reporting 
thirty to 40 investigators from the ntsb delta boeing and 
pratt amp whitney which manufactured the planes three engines 
fanned out over an area about the size of two football fields 
examining pieces of the wrecked aircraft 
wearing gloves and carrying bags some crawled inside the 
charred hulk using the same cracks where passengers braved flaming 
jet fuel 24 hours earlier they also climbed on the lone remaining 
attached wing which had been turned redhot by the fire to peer 
into the cabin through blackened windows at one point about 20 of 
them gathered peering intently at the left rear engine they 
removed the engine shroud and looked inside 
the cockpit recording as well as the planes flight data 
recorder had already been recovered in good condition from the 
wreckage and taken to washington for analysis 
dickinson said safety board officials had listened to the 
cockpit tape recording just once and they and other investigators 
planned to listen to again 
the pilot capt larry davis 48 of greenville was pinned in 
the wreckage and had to be extricated by rescuers he was listed in 
fair condition thursday at parkland hospital in dallas suffering 
back injuries and burns 
davis has been a delta pilot since 1965 and a boeing 727 captain 
for nine years 
his copilot and engineer also survived the accident but two 
delta flight attendants were among the 13 fatalities all of the 
dead were from texas 
ninetyseven passengers and a crew of seven were listed aboard 
the aircraft but the exact count was uncertain because babies were 
not included on passenger lists 
three years ago a delta l1011 crashed at the same airport 
killing 137 in the worst aviation accident in texas history 
delta spokesman henry conley said none of the airlines other 
727s would be pulled from service because of wednesdays crash 
we dont see anything serious enough to pull any planes he 
said

rightwing president augusto pinochet 
announced that hundreds of his critics living in exile may return 
to chile but opponents said the move and others like it are 
aimed only at winning votes in a presidential referendum 
four hours after thursdays announcement isabel allende 44 
the daughter of former president salvador allende flew to 
santiago she has been living in mexico since her father a 
selfproclaimed marxist died during a bloody coup led by pinochet 
15 years ago 
asked why she returned she told reporters at the airport 
because its my legitimate right 
she said her mother hortensia bussi the exiled widow of 
allende also plans to return we are going to prepare a grand 
entrance through the front door as weve always said ms 
allende said 
jose oyarce a communist who was labor minister in the allende 
government returned to his homeland on the same flight as ms 
allende 
pinochet lifted a ban on the return of 430 chileans who had 
opposed him including some of the fiercest leftist opponents of 
his military government 
the prohibitions are lifted all of them the president told 
reporters i have spoken this morning with the interior minister 
and have given instructions with respect to exile that totally 
solves this problem 
opponents said the army general is only trying to lure voters in 
an oct 5 presidential referendum in which pinochet is the sole 
candidate 
his nomination for the referendum was made tuesday by pinochet 
himself and the commanders of the navy air force and national 
police it sparked nationwide antigovernment protests 
if the majority of chileans vote no in the ballot an open 
election is to be held if they vote yes pinochet would begin 
an eightyear term as president in march 
the regime is trying to change pinochets image on the eve 
of the referendum said patricio aylwin leader of a 16party 
opposition coalition 
aylwin challenged pinochet to a free and open debate on 
national television so he can have the opportunity to contrast 
his ideas with those of the opposition 
in another move opponents say was aimed at winning the 
referendum pinochet last week lifted the state of emergency that 
has suppressed civil liberties since the 1973 coup 
the president also ordered a 3 percent reduction in the price of 
gasoline 
on wednesday pinochet made a conciliatory gesture toward his 
critics appealing for their support in a nationally televised 
speech 
there is a new democracy ahead of us we must work together to 
make it efficient the 72yearold general said our democracy 
has a place for everybody 
the tone of the speech contrasted sharply with pinochets past 
references to opposition leaders whom he has called traitors 
and bandits who sell out their motherland 
pinochet told reporters at the government palace thursday that 
he is not shifting his style in an effort to change his 
authoritarian image 
what happens is that a person must act according to the 
circumstances he said 
supporters praised pinochets moves as proof of his intention to 
hold an honest referendum 
the decision of ending exile is part of the presidents appeal 
to peace and unity of all chileans said interior minister sergio 
fernandez 
carlos cabello leader of an independent organization supporting 
pinochet said the move shows the presidents deep democratic 
conviction 
but jose sanfuentes a spokesman for the outlawed communist 
party said pinochet will take other measures to try to buy out 
the consciences of chileans but these measures will not prevent 
the collapse of his dictatorship

the unprecedented chaos in congress while 
president miguel de la madrid delivered his last address to the 
nation drew a blizzard of criticism and praise with some calling 
it offensive and others saying it was just democracy in action 
opposition delegates interrupted de la madrid continuously 
thursday in a series of displays never before seen in congress 
which has been absolutely controlled by the institutional 
revolutionary party or pri for 59 years 
the outbursts included chants of fraud and mexico 
opposition delegates waved what they said were burned invalidated 
ballots and staged a walkout that almost degenerated into a brawl 
de la madrid maintained his composure throughout the 3hour 
speech as he sought to sum up a sixyear term that began in near 
bankruptcy and is ending with economic reform and political 
controversy 
let us be tolerant even in the face of the insults of our 
political adversaries he said departing from his prepared text 
after the walkout 
the noisy demonstrations showed the delegates courage in 
demanding explanations said democratic front presidential 
candidate cuauhtemoc cardenas who claims fraud cheated him of 
victory in the july 6 elections 
the general secretary of the pri manuel camacho solis praised 
de la madrids coolness and condemned the protesters for 
immaturity and antidemocratic practices 
fidel velazquez the crusty 87yearold labor leader who heads 
one of the strongest sections of the governing party said hed 
never seen anything like it but then we never had such silly 
opposition before he added 
later a democratic front delegate salvador miranda polanco 
announced he was changing his loyalty to the pri in part because he 
does not agree with fascist ideologies 
a presidential spokesman who in accord with standard practice 
could not be named was more sanguine the protests he said were 
normal in any parliamentary system 
the speech was interrupted regularly from the beginning but the 
climax came when leftist democratic front delegates led by sen 
porfirio munoz ledo walked out amid shouts of traitor get 
out judas and assorted obscenities 
munoz ledo who was once president of the pri was kicked in the 
rear and hit in the neck by two pri state governors a governing 
party legislator grabbed munoz ledo and asked what is happening 
to you this is not the time brother 
the galleries filled with pri supporters wives and military 
brass roared disapproval and governing party delegates chanted 
mexico to drown out the opposition 
we are walking out in protest because they refused to let the 
voice of the opposition be heard munoz ledo declared de la 
madrids speech he said was full of falsehoods and 
inaccuracies 
members of the rightist national action party demonstrated but 
did not walk out party leader abel vincenio tovar said he 
respected the gesture but preferred less hysterical means 
he criticized the pri for packing the house his party with 101 
delegates was allowed to invite a total of four spectators he 
said 
when the ruling party doesnt have the backing of the people 
they have to bring their own supporters he said 
the same fractious congress must in the next two months 
certify the election of de la madrids successor carlos salinas de 
gortari who did not attend salinas is scheduled to take over dec 
1 
the most strident objections came when de la madrid spoke of the 
controversial july 6 vote which he praised as historic but 
there were also interruptions as he spoke of his economic reforms 
the reforms reduced state control of the economy kept the 
nation out of bankruptcy and controlled inflation but also reduced 
the average mexicans buying power by about 50 percent 
de la madrids own election reforms broke the governing partys 
stranglehold and allowed opposition strength to grow before 
mirandas announced switch the pri held 260 seats in the chamber 
of deputies to 139 for the democratic front and national actions 
101 
the democratic front also holds four of 64 senate seats 
national action holds none 
statecontrolled mexican television showed some of the protests 
during a live broadcast of the speech 
although the cameras shied away during the walkout shouts and 
curses were audible mexicans later watched the entire incident on 
news shows

amnesty international says it hopes to raise the 
conscience of youth when bruce springsteen peter gabriel and 
other rock stars launch a worldwide concert tour dedicated to human 
rights 
the sixweek tour which opens tonight at londons wembley 
stadium will go to 20 cities in north america asia hungary 
africa and latin america 
the 23 million extravaganza is to mark the 40th anniversary of 
the united nations universal declaration on human rights 
organizers expect sellout crowds but stress that raising money is 
not the sole intention 
this tour is not about charity its about justice said 
jack healey head of the us division of the organization which 
monitors human rights abuses and won the nobel peace prize in 1977 
what were talking about is human rights and the seriousness 
of the issue theres too much torture too many people being 
killed he said 
the pop stars taking part are both realistic and romantic about 
playing for human rights 
when i was younger i thought maybe you could pick a guitar up 
and you could change the world springsteen 38 said at a news 
conference thursday 
i dont really believe that any more but i do believe you can 
save a life he added someone comes to the show they hear the 
message they hear what we are singing about they go home they 
write a letter and someone gets out of prison early thats pretty 
good 
springsteen is sharing a bill on the 35000mile tour with 
gabriel and sting american folk singer tracey chapman and sengals 
youssou ndour 
more than 1 million people are expected to see the concerts 
live with televison audiences of many more 
ticket prices vary from rich to poorer countries 3760 in 
london and 3 in budapest hungary the final concert is scheduled 
in the argentine capital buenos aires on oct 15 
the us sports goods manufacturer reebok has underwritten the 
cost of the tour and organizers say they hope it will break even 
this is definitely not for fundraising said healey who 
put together a twoweek american tour called conspiracy of hope 
in 1986 featuring gabriel sting and an irish group u2 
it convinced him that rock music works for human rights 
amnestys us membership rose by 100000 to 250000 in the year 
following the tour 
the organization has a worldwide membership of 750000 
every audience member will get a card with the text of the un 
declaration on human rights spectators will also be able to sign 
slips of paper saying they uphold the declaration at the end of 
tour amnesty plans to deliver these to the governments of the 
nations visited 
amnestys venture is the latest using rock music to raise 
consciences 
irish rock singer bob geldofs live aid concert in 1985 raised 
millions of dollars for the starving ethiopians and this year 
thousands turned out to mark south african black leader nelson 
mandelas 70th birthday with a london concert 
the reason we have an appeal for the young is i believe the 
fact that they are still able to say when they hear of an 
individuals plight but thats not fair said marie staunton 
director of amnestys british section 
gabriel a longtime campaigner for amnesty said he agreed with 
critics that a song wont change the behavior of a dictator 
but we hope it can affect the way his children and his 
grandchildren think these are our target said gabriel

the united states normally casts a benign eye 
on countries that welcome foreign investment engage in free trade 
repay their debts respect their neighbors and oppose communism 
there arent many countries with all these perceived virtues 
but one that does chile has had a virutally unbroken record of 
poor relations with the united states for 15 years 
this seemingly anomalous situation has occurred because of 
chiles military president augusto pinochet whose human rights 
abuses and distrust for democracy have more than offset aspects of 
his rule which generally get an approving nod from washington 
lately the reagan administration has adopted a friendlier view 
toward pinochet now that many civil liberties have been restored as 
the country gears up for a presidential plebiscite next month in 
which the 72yearold general will be the lone candidate 
top military commanders announced their selection of pinochet on 
tuesday touching off a wave of protests that led to the deaths of 
at least three people and the arrests of more than 1000 others 
while the united states has kept its distance diplomatically 
from the general for years pinochet himself has been scornful of 
washington telling american visitors that us leaders should be 
more appreciative of a government that deposed a marxistled 
regime an event virtually without precedent 
indeed some american officials citing pinochets economic and 
foreign policies believe long years of reagan administration 
hostility toward chile was misguided 
as an example with the exception of honduras chile sided with 
the united states on more un votes than any other latin american 
country during the last general assembly session among all third 
world nations only turkey and honduras were more supportive of 
washingtons positions 
beyond that while other hemispheric countries are mired in 
economic crisis chile boasted a healthy 54 percent growth rate 
last year using marketoriented policies the us advocates 
and unlike many other hemispheric countries chile pays its 
debts allows foreign investors to remit profits and has been 
selling off staterun enterprises 
also winning sympathy for pinochet among some officials is the 
presence of wellarmed guerrilla groups which have staged repeated 
terrorist attacks over the years 
but at a time when the united states has been emphasizing 
democractic development in the hemisphere the administration felt 
it could not make an exception by showing friendship toward 
pinochet 
the administrations attempts to promote democracy in nicaragua 
would lose credibility if chile were exempted from this policy 
officials contended overriding those who favored greater 
recognition of the positive side of pinochets rule 
beyond that the democratic majority in congress many of whom 
have bitter memories of the early years of the pinochet regime 
strongly oppose any accommodation with chile 
whatever gratitude pinochet generated in washington for ousting 
president salvador allende in 1973 was shortlived because of way 
he dealt with those who opposed him 
as outlined by aryeh neier director of americas watch a new 
yorkbased human rights group there were a huge number of 
killings in chile during those early years nobody knows the 
actual count he says 
some political activists disappeared without a trace and there 
were widespread allegations that political detainees were tortured 
american alienation from chile was aggravated when us 
investigators blamed chilean security agents for the 1976 
carbombing death in washington of a former top allende aide 
orlando letelier this was one of the most notorious incidents of 
international terrorism ever to occur on us soil 
a decade ago chile was a major target of the fresh emphasis on 
human rights introduced by president carter nowadays the us 
focus is on democracy in the hemisphere and at long last the 
prospect of the first genuine electoral test in chile since 1973 
has induced hopes in washington that representative democracy may 
return to chile 
still the long record of us hostility toward pinochet 
contrasts sharply with the friendship the united states 
demonstrated for years toward another third world military 
strongman president mohammed zia ulhaq of pakistan who was 
killed in a plane crash two weeks ago 
the records of both zia and pinochet on human rights are 
similar for washington the difference is that zia ruled a 
strategically important country and pinochet doesnt

at the close of a summer when americans baked 
under extreme heat and watched beaches fouled by medical wastes 
george bush and michael dukakis are both fighting hard to convince 
voters they are friends of the environment 
republican nominee bush who boasts i am an environmentalist 
always have been finds himself battling both dukakis and a 
reagan administration record that environmental groups contend was 
often inimical to the causes of clean air land and water 
bush took that battle to boston harbor on thursday where he 
accused the democratic nominee of dragging his heels while the 
pollutionclogged harbor got dirtier and dirtier 
dukakis ridiculed bushs electionyear conversion saying 
boston harbor has been polluted for hundreds of years and im 
very proud to be the governor whos cleaning it up no thanks to 
vice president bush and the administration he is part of 
boston harbor is not michael dukakis shining moment said 
jeff webb a friends of the earth lobbyist but thats one issue 
in one state what about eight years of neglect 
in a march assessment the league of conservation voters league 
gave dukakis a grade of b and bush a dplus 
arlene odonnell of the massachusetts audubon society said 
dukakis has exhibited a growing sensitivity to environmental 
issues although he still tends on bulldozerversustrees kind 
of things to take the business side 
bush said wednesday that 1988 in a sense is the year the 
earth spoke back he called for an international conference next 
year to discuss global warming and ozone depletion which may be 
behind the unusually hot summer 
republicans say one of their own teddy roosevelt was one of 
the first environmentalists and bush hopes to reclaim the 
environmental mantle for the gop 
but to do that he must overcome distrust left by president 
reagans problems with the superfund to clean up toxic waste the 
presidents goslow attitude toward new measures to curb acid rain 
measures bush endorsed in a speech wednesday and reagans 1987 
veto of a 20 billion authorization to clean up us waterways 
environmentalists also criticize bush for heading a deregulation 
task force that paved the way for a reagan executive order giving 
the white house office of management and budget veto power over 
environmental and other regulations dukakis has promised to revoke 
that executive order 
in reply to a questionnaire from the league of conservation 
voters bush said in the past few years we have not done enough 
to protect the environment i will do more 
bush has backed a goal of no net loss of wetlands 
dukakis has called for protecting existing wetlands and 
restoring part of the vast endowment of wetlands that america has 
lost but his administration approved filling a swamp for a 
shopping center near attleboro a development the reagan 
environmental protection agency went to court to block 
dukakis has won high marks among some environmentalists for his 
dogged battle to block licensing of the stillborn seabrook nuclear 
plant in new hampshire as well as court fights to block oil 
drilling in the georges bank off the new england coast 
bush himself a pioneer of the offshore drilling industry last 
spring endorsed a moratorium on drilling in sensitive offshore 
areas such as california he also has promised to seek an end to 
dumping of wastes in the ocean by 1991 
dukakis said bush recently supported offshore drilling in a 
texas appearance prompting the democrat to declare that the nation 
needed a president whose environmental policy doesnt change with 
the time zones 
on nuclear power dukakis opposes construction of new commercial 
reactors until a new safer design is developed and ways are found 
to treat and dispose of nuclear waste 
bush says i believe nuclear power must be a part of our 
energy mix and says he will insist on the highest safety 
standards 
on acid rain bush promised wednesday to ask congress to cut 
millions of tons of sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2000 and 
to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions 
dukakis has said he will use authority under existing law to 
force industrial states that are major contributors to the acid 
rain problem to find solutions within three years 
both favor clean coal research to tap the nations abundant 
supply of fossil fuel

investigators examining the pratt amp whitney 
jt8d engine as a possible cause of wednesdays delta air lines 
crash are scrutinizing a powerplant with which the aircraft 
industry has conducted a quartercentury love affair 
almost 12000 of the engines have been sold since the federal 
aviation administration approved them in 1964 today they are used 
by 350 airlines governments and corporations and are more widely 
utilized than all other commercial jet engines combined pratt amp 
whitney spokesman david long said thursday 
its one of the more reliable engines on the market today 
said james p mcfadden aerospace analyst for merrill lynch capital 
markets in new york 
even before delta flight 1141 plunged to the ground wednesday 
shortly after takeoff from dallasfort worth international airport 
the government had named the jt8d as contributing to two major 
accidents that occurred in 1985 
on thursday national transportation safety board member lee 
dickinson said recordings of cockpit conversations on flight 1141 
before the accident revealed discussions of engine problems and 
noises indicating a stall may have been imminent 
witnesses reported seeing flames streaming from an engine just 
before the crash thirteen people were killed but nearly 100 
survived the fiery wreck 
despite those blemishes the engine is so reliable the 
government uses the frequency rate with which they break down in 
flight as the benchmark against which new engines are measured 
so far this year the jt8ds have shut down in flight 0012 times 
per 1000 hours of flight long said from pratt amp whitney offices 
in east hartford conn 
according to jay pardee manager of the faas engine 
certification office in burlington mass some engines have been 
known to shut down one or two times per 1000 hours of flight 
its a goal we require all new technologies to meet pardee 
said of the jt8ds performance statistics 
all boeing 727s flight 1141 was a 727 use three of the 
engines mounted on the rear of the aircraft they are also used on 
many boeing 737s and mcdonnell douglas dc9s in addition 
mcdonnell douglas md80s use jt8d200s an advanced model of the 
engine 
pratt amp whitney estimates that in all the engines have flown 
more than 400 million hours in nearly a quartercentury of service 
for an engine to be around for 25 years says a lot about its 
acceptance said mcfadden of merrill lynch 
but problems with the jt8d have been blamed by government 
officials as contributing to two major air accidents in 1985 
in manchester england in august of that year the engines 
combustion chamber cracked and burned through on a british airtours 
jetliner during takeoff fiftyfive people died when the plane 
caught fire 
the accident sparked widespread inspections of combustion 
chambers of older highuse jt8d engines as well as a requirement 
for more frequent inspections to check for cracks 
the next month a midwest express dc9 crashed in milwaukee 
killing 31 people in an accident that was blamed on a fracture of 
the engine spacers which separate the turbine blades afterward 
the faa ordered owners of planes with the engines to conduct 
inspections looking for cracks and to replace the spacers 
periodically

the fbi expects to lose up to half its 
professional staff to retirement over the next decade and will need 
an aggressive recruitment campaign to find new agents the bureaus 
director says 
william sessions said at a luncheon meeting thursday that the 
recruitment demands make it even more challenging to find women and 
minorities for the fbi 
it is clear that we must develop effective measures to respond 
to our extraordinary hiring needs sessions said somehow it 
feels like bobbing for apples at halloween with your hands behind 
your back 
not only has the pool of college graduates begun a projected 
10year decline the fbi does not have the salaries and employee 
benefits to compete with private industry sessions said 
we have esprit we have an important and urgent mission we 
have the strong call of meaningful public service but we must 
still battle to gain the agents with the skills and education 
necessary to fulfill our mission 
within nine years sessions said more than half the fbis 
professionals about 4500 people will either be forced or 
eligible to retire 
sessions said that as part of the recruitment effort he has 
approved a fiveyear minority hiring program designed to increase 
the number of blacks and hispanics in the fbi 
out of 9597 agents 417 are black and 439 are hispanic in the 
us population blacks account for about 12 percent and hispanics 
make up about 8 percent 
sessions a former federal judge said that since he became fbi 
director 10 months ago he has moved to eliminate racism and 
discrimination 
from the beginning i have tried to make the fbis policy 
against racism and discrimination crystal clear to every member of 
the fbi both by policy statements and by personally addressing 
employees he said 
but he refused to talk about pending legal actions taken by a 
group of hispanic agents and by a black agent 
more than 300 of the bureaus hispanic agents have filed a 
classaction suit in el paso texas contending the fbi 
discriminates against them in promotions discipline and 
assignments a federal judge is expected to issue a decision in the 
case by oct 1 the hispanics seek unspecified damages and changes 
in fbi policies 
in the other case donald rochon a black agent in the 
philadelphia office has filed racial harassment charges against 
the government the equal employment opportunity commission has 
already upheld many of rochons complaints stemming from his 
tenure in the omaha neb office 
sessions acknowledged that the fbi must make improvements so its 
agent workforce will more nearly reflect our nations ethnic 
composition 
he said the fbi is seeking to hire women and minorities in 
specialties needed increasingly by the bureau linguists 
engineers computer scientists lawyers and accountants

consumers who are braced for higher food 
prices because of the summers drought should breathe a little 
easier says an agriculture department economist 
fears that the total at the checkout counter is going to shoot 
upward because of farmers problems are largely based on erroneous 
assumptions about the way food prices are set and on exaggerations 
of the droughts effects on food supplies says ralph parlett of 
the departments economic research service 
although grain and soybean stocks are not as large as they 
were in some prior drought years we are in no foreseeable danger 
of running out of food parlett says in an article in the 
departments farmline magazine 
supplies of grains are more than ample to meet demand 
parlett said winter wheat used for baking bread was harvested 
before the drought struck meat and poultry production is expected 
to hit record levels and most fruit and vegetable crops will be 
undamaged because they are grown under irrigation he said 
the bottom line overall food prices which had previously been 
forecast to rise 2 to 4 percent this year now are expected to go 
up 3 to 5 percent a onepoint boost because of the dry weather 
there is concern however that some middlemen in the food chain 
might seek to exploit the dry conditions as an excuse for higher 
prices at least two members of congress rep byron dorgan 
dnd and sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate 
agriculture committee have asked the general accounting office to 
monitor food prices for evidence of gouging 
we know that in previous times gouging has occurred dorgan 
said the gao congress investigative arm will track food prices 
at the farm the wholesale and retail levels for a marketbasket 
that includes white bread choice beef chicken bacon milk 
fruit vegetables ground beef chuck roast spaghetti and macaroni 
people vote with their food dollars said dorgan if we 
find price gouging the ability to spotlight that will persuade 
consumers to move their dollars toward other brands or other 
commodities 
parlett said most affected by price increases will be pasta 
products which are made from droughtdamaged durum wheat 
vegetable oils oatbased cereals and a few fruits and vegetables 
such as sweet corn peas dry beans and tart cherries 
fresh fruit and vegetable supplies and quality have been 
affected in some nonirrigated drought areas where food stores look 
to local farmers to fill their produce departments during the 
growing season but most produce effects were felt in areas where 
vegetables are grown for canning parlett said 
fears that drought translates into sharply higher food prices 
are founded on some false assumptions the economist said 
if shortages do result in higher commodity prices for farmers 
the effect is greatly diluted by the time the product reaches the 
consumer because the farm value of foods accounts for an average of 
only 30 percent of their retail price most of the cost of an item 
is in its processing packaging and marketing 
in addition said parlett food middlemen tend to absorb at 
least some of the shortterm fluctuations in farm prices and since 
food production is geographically diversified even widespread 
droughts affect only certain production sectors with commodities 
such as grains which are in surplus reserves are available to 
make up for droughtattenuated crops 
dry weather has a reverse effect on meat supplies usually 
forcing increases in slaughter and a supply glut which tends to 
hold down consumer prices in the short run the reduced cattle and 
hog numbers could have a delayed upward influence on prices 
however probably leading to price increases next year said 
parlett 
historically food prices tend to rise every year regardless of 
farm prices he said in the 1980 drought year food prices rose 86 
percent but that was down from 109 percent in 1979 when crops 
were good he pointed out another drought in 1983 was accompanied 
by a 21 percent food cost rise the lowest since 1967

the soviet union has bought an additional 
100000 metric tons for delivery this year under a longterm supply 
agreement between the two countries the agriculture department 
says 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 100000 tons of 
corn would be about 39 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 249 per bushel at the 
farm level meaning that the sale could have a farm value of around 
98 million 
the corn is part of the grain the soviet union is committed to 
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement which calls 
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of us grain 
the pact expires sept 30 and there have been negotiations for a 
new one 
according to the agreement the annual purchases are supposed to 
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn the 
soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as 
wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting as two 
tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
if the latest purchase is shipped before the current agreement 
expires the soviets will have bought 527 million tons of corn in 
addition to more than 9 million tons of wheat 830700 tons of 
soybeans and 13 million tons of soybean meal

the occupational safety and health 
administration has failed to enforce laws protecting the nations 
workers a failure contributing to thousands of workplace deaths a 
critic of the federal agency says 
a report being released today by the chicagobased national safe 
workplace institute concluded that oshas ineffectiveness and 
unwillingness to be tough with violators has resulted in more than 
9000 avoidable workplace fatalities since 1981 
however statisticians and the federal agency disputed the 
figure and said onthejob deaths have declined sharply during the 
1980s 
this report represents a selective use of statistics oshas 
chief spokesman terry mikelson said it creates the impression 
that more and more people are being killed at work that more and 
more people are being hurt when just the opposite is true 
the institute which is supported by foundation grants and 
private contributions said the united states has become a 
firstrate nation with a secondrate record of protecting its 
workers 
we have to agree with some of what they say said margaret 
seminario associate director of safety and health for the aflcio 
we really do have some serious problems with osha 
the report a copy of which was obtained thursday accused the 
agency of inconsistency and criticized sweetheart deals that 
reduced fines against large corporate violators 
for example it said osha proposed fines of 148 million 
against union carbide corp in 1986 but accepted a settlement of 
408500 
but mikelson the osha spokesman said historically the 
agency has reduced penalties in the interest of obtaining immediate 
abatement of hazards that is our mission to correct hazards to 
get them out of the workplace and weve done that 
the report said osha does not have a comprehensive program to 
target employers for inspections 
it said osha inspectors were three times more likely to issue 
their most serious sanction a willful citation in fiscal 1980 
before president reagan took office than in fiscal 1981 through 
1987 
oshas senior staff has failed to provide leadership to make 
its civil enforcement programs effective the institute said 
that failure has cost lives if we had continued improving job 
safety at the same rate which was in place in 1980 9115 workplace 
fatality victims would still be alive today 
the conclusion was based on a statistical analysis reflecting a 
change in the rate of deaths among workers in highrisk jobs 
agriculture construction transportation and manufacturing it 
said the rate of highrisk deaths declined by an annual rate of 22 
percent from 1975 through 1980 and by 07 percent from 1981 through 
1987 
the chicagobased national safety council whose data was used 
in the analysis said the death toll from onthejob accidents has 
fallen from 13000 in 1975 to 11100 last year 
it may be theyre hoping people wont look into how they 
arrived at their conclusions and just take them at face value 
said alan hoskin the councils director of statistics 
he said the sixyear period used to determine the death trend 
was too short and the assumption of a constant decline in 
fatalities very rarely exists in the real world 
we very carefully researched the methodology with the american 
statistical association said joseph a kinney executive 
director of the institute they checked everything out and think 
our approach was very fair 
the asas executive director barbara bailar disagreed 
i dont think anybody really looked at it very carefully 
she said i think thats an extremely dangerous thing to do 
projections are noted for having a lot of problems with them

the broadcast and electronics industries are 
praising the federal communications commissions endorsement of 
advanced television systems with enhanced sound and picture quality 
the fcc on thursday declared the new systems in the public 
interest and approved some preliminary rules for bringing them into 
american homes but the commission said many technical and 
procedural problems still must be ironed out 
the high definition tv systems will be designed to have the 
clarity of movie film and the sound of compact discs they probably 
will not be available from the us broadcast industry before 1993 
according to an official of the national association of 
broadcasters 
michael rau the nabs vice president for science and 
technology said the fcc made a strong commitment to bring 
advanced tv to the public they seemed to reaffirm support for 
free overtheair broadcasting 
but the commission must solve the difficulties of delivering 
the system over broadcast outlets 
in a series of preliminary rulings the fcc said 
existing broadcasters and stations are best equipped to bring 
the new system to viewers 
advanced television programs must be received on existing 
television sets so viewers wont have to replace their equipment 
if additional frequency space is needed it should be found 
within existing vhf and uhf television bands the fcc found that 
looking for frequencies outside those bands would delay the 
service and noted that bands now suitable for the systems are in 
use for other purposes 
mark rosenker spokesman for the electronics industry 
association said his group of electronics manufacturers is 
pleased that the fccs decision has begun to define the 
complex issues regarding high definition television so that the 
american public will be able to enjoy the benefits within a 
relatively short period 
the fcc sought public comment on three options for using the 
airwaves for high definition tv there would be a 60day comment 
period and 30 days for replies 
fcc chairman dennis r patrick and commissioner patricia diaz 
dennis supported all the commissions findings and proposed 
options commissioner james h quello dissented on grounds the 
commission acted prematurely 
quello said the fcc based its preliminary findings on computer 
projections and should have waited until the technology was tested 
and developed 
but patrick said the technology to improve picture resolution 
exists today and the fcc should spur further research and 
development 
his view was supported by ms dennis who said some urge us 
to move more slowly to wait for more evidence before acting that 
is tempting but delay creates significant costs 
although patrick said the preliminary rulings would put the 
us in the forefront of the international quest for new tv 
technology the japanese have been working on an advanced system 
for two decades 
they plan to offer a preview with broadcasts of the summer 
olympics to high definition tv sets in about 50 bigcity department 
stores throughout japan 
the picture on a standard television set in the united states is 
produced by a signal that scans more than 200000 dots on 525 
lines the japanese system has 1125 scanning lines 
us broadcasters are concerned that us research efforts to 
develop an industry transmission standard for high definition tv 
may not be moving fast enough to head off a probable japanese 
invasion of the new technology 
high definition tv is expected to be introduced by the japanese 
to homes in their country in 1990

cuba is undertaking a major buildup of its 
forces in angola raising the possibility of a joint cubanangolan 
offensive against usbacked rebels according to american 
officials 
with cuban troop strength possibly exceeding 60000 the 
officials said cuba may also be contemplating a crossborder strike 
into south africancontrolled namibia angolas southern neighbor 
the cuban buildup accompanied by an estimated two dozen mig23 
fighter jets helicopter gunships tanks and other equipment 
worries us officials who have been hoping for a negotiated 
withdrawal of the cuban forces 
some officials believe that the cubans may merely be attempting 
to improve their bargaining position at fourway talks aimed at 
achieving both a cuban withdrawal and namibian independence from 
south africa 
but one official speaking only on condition of anonymity said 
the sheer numbers of cubans and equipment involved in the buildup 
suggest that the cubans are thinking more of a military offensive 
than a withdrawal 
the numbers are frightening the official said 
the buildup began several weeks ago with about one ship a week 
loaded with troops and equipment undertaking the transatlantic 
crossing if the us estimates are correct cuba has increased its 
troop strength by about 25000 since last november 
the fourway talks involve officials from cuba angola and south 
africa with the united states serving as mediator the next round 
will take place next week in the congolese capital of brazzaville 
south africa concluded the withdrawal of its troops from angola 
earlier this week and has said it will begin a withdrawal later 
this year from namibia provided cuba agrees to an early pullout 
from angola 
a south african pullback would set in motion a united nations 
plan for the establishment of an independent government in the 
territory 
the officials said the south africans decided to withdraw from 
angola after recognizing that the cuban buildup had changed the 
power balance in the southern part of the country leaving south 
african troops vulnerable 
they said south africans may not even be a match for cuban 
forces in namibia where pretoria has been the colonial power for 
73 years one official said cuba has 50 percent more tanks in 
angola than south africa has in its entire inventory 
as one official described it cuban president fidel castro has 
his eye on the history books possibly hoping to free namibia 
from south african control and to help defeat the anticommunist 
insurgency that has been operating in angola for 13 years 
the unita insurgency has received us military support for the 
past three years and controls much of the southeastern part of the 
country 
the fourway talks were convened last may in london at the 
suggestion of us assistant secretary of state chester crocker at 
the time officials said the parties appeared eager for a 
negotiated settlement realizing that a military solution was 
impossible 
but some officials now believe that cuba has had in mind a 
military solution all along and they say that theory has been 
bolstered by the cuban buildup

the government imposed more than 1 million in 
fines on 32 airlines for faulty airport security procedures as part 
of a stepped up effort to improve passenger screening 
the fines announced thursday by the federal aviation 
administration range from 1000 against a number smaller mainly 
commuter airlines to 215000 against united airlines 156000 
against northwest airlines and 113000 against delta air lines 
while the passenger screening at airport checkpoints usually is 
conducted by private security companies the airlines hire the 
companies and are responsible for the program 
the fines stem from faa tests conducted at major airports 
nationwide in which agency inspectors carried phony weapons through 
airport security checkpoints without being detected the faa said 
faa administrator allan mcartor said a recent audit of the 
security tests conducted by the faa showed improved screening but 
nearly 15 percent of the phony weapons still passed through 
undetected 
the 856 percent detection rate during the first six months of 
the year compares with a 789 percent rate during all of 1987 
mcartor said he added that some airport checkpoints detected more 
than 95 percent of the weapons in the faa tests he said 
but mcartor said that while the improvement in the detection 
rate is encouraging tough enforcement measures including civil 
penalties are needed to insure industrywide improvements and 
systemwide safety 
security lapses at airport checkpoints became a focus of 
attention last year when a congressional report chastized the faa 
for the screening systems shortcomings 
the subject gained additional attention after a disgruntled 
former usair employee smuggled a weapon aboard a pacific southwest 
airlines jet and began shooting causing the plane to crash all 43 
people aboard the plane which was flying from los angeles to san 
francisco were killed 
after the incident the faa announced it was using special teams 
of investigators to test security at 16 major airports last march 
transportation secretary jim burnley said the tests would improve 
the effectiveness of the screening programs 
we want to see a 100 percent success rate in detecting weapons 
and dummy weapons burnley said in a statement thursday he 
promised to continue the airport tests 
mcartor meanwhile indicated that the faa may seek additional 
fines in the future if lapses are uncovered we have no choice 
but to take tough enforcement action in those instances where 
security lapses are discovered he said 
here are the airlines that were fined in the action announced 
thursday 
united airlines 215000 northwest airlines 156000 delta 
air lines 113000 american airlines 96000 continental 
airlines 79000 eastern airlines 67000 trans world airlines

the united states normally casts a benign eye 
on countries that welcome foreign investment engage in free trade 
repay their debts respect their neighbors and oppose communism 
there arent many countries with all these perceived virtues 
but one that does chile has had a virutally unbroken record of 
poor relations with the united states for 15 years 
this seemingly anomalous situation has occurred because of 
chiles military president augusto pinochet whose human rights 
abuses and distrust for democracy have more than offset aspects of 
his rule which generally get an approving nod from washington 
lately the reagan administration has adopted a friendlier view 
toward pinochet now that many civil liberties have been restored as 
the country gears up for a presidential plebiscite next month in 
which the 72yearold general will be the lone candidate 
top military commanders announced their selection of pinochet on 
tuesday touching off a wave of protests that led to the deaths of 
at least three people and the arrests of more than 1000 others 
while the united states has kept its distance diplomatically 
from the general for years pinochet himself has been scornful of 
washington telling american visitors that us leaders should be 
more appreciative of a government that deposed a marxistled 
regime an event virtually without precedent 
indeed some american officials citing pinochets economic and 
foreign policies believe long years of reagan administration 
hostility toward chile was misguided 
as an example with the exception of honduras chile sided with 
the united states on more un votes than any other latin american 
country during the last general assembly session among all third 
world nations only turkey and honduras were more supportive of 
washingtons positions 
beyond that while other hemispheric countries are mired in 
economic crisis chile boasted a healthy 54 percent growth rate 
last year using marketoriented policies the us advocates 
and unlike many other hemispheric countries chile pays its 
debts allows foreign investors to remit profits and has been 
selling off staterun enterprises 
also winning sympathy for pinochet among some officials is the 
presence of wellarmed guerrilla groups which have staged repeated 
terrorist attacks over the years 
but at a time when the united states has been emphasizing 
democractic development in the hemisphere the administration felt 
it could not make an exception by showing friendship toward 
pinochet 
the administrations attempts to promote democracy in nicaragua 
would lose credibility if chile were exempted from this policy 
officials contended overriding those who favored greater 
recognition of the positive side of pinochets rule 
beyond that the democratic majority in congress many of whom 
have bitter memories of the early years of the pinochet regime 
strongly oppose any accommodation with chile 
whatever gratitude pinochet generated in washington for ousting 
president salvador allende in 1973 was shortlived because of way 
he dealt with those who opposed him 
as outlined by aryeh neier director of americas watch a new 
yorkbased human rights group there were a huge number of 
killings in chile during those early years nobody knows the 
actual count he says 
some political activists disappeared without a trace and there 
were widespread allegations that political detainees were tortured 
american alienation from chile was aggravated when us 
investigators blamed chilean security agents for the 1976 
carbombing death in washington of a former top allende aide 
orlando letelier this was one of the most notorious incidents of 
international terrorism ever to occur on us soil 
a decade ago chile was a major target of the fresh emphasis on 
human rights introduced by president carter nowadays the us 
focus is on democracy in the hemisphere and at long last the 
prospect of the first genuine electoral test in chile since 1973 
has induced hopes in washington that representative democracy may 
return to chile 
still the long record of us hostility toward pinochet 
contrasts sharply with the friendship the united states 
demonstrated for years toward another third world military 
strongman president mohammed zia ulhaq of pakistan who was 
killed in a plane crash two weeks ago 
the records of both zia and pinochet on human rights are 
similar for washington the difference is that zia ruled a 
strategically important country and pinochet doesnt

the supreme court on thursday night stayed a 
lower court ruling that had upheld contempt citations against four 
yonkers ny city councilmen for fighting a federally ordered 
desegregation plan a high court spokeswoman said 
but in a related decision the high court refused to stay a 
contempt ruling against the city 
the court granted stays to council members henry spallone 
nicholas longo edward fagan and peter chema court spokeswoman 
toni house said 
the court has granted the stay for the four council members 
until they have had time to ask the court formally to fully review 
their cases ms house said 
the application so far as the city of yonkers is concerned has 
been denied she added 
she said the entire court considered the applications and 
justices thurgood marshall and william brennan filed a 12page 
dissent 
on friday a federal appeals panel upheld a judges contempt 
finding but gave the councilmen and yonkers a week to seek an 
emergency stay from the supreme court before reinstating the 
penalties 
the council members had faced 500aday fines and jail and the 
city could be hit with 1 million a day in penalties 
in yonkers mayor nicholas wasicsko said early friday it 
seems at first curious that the fines would be stayed against the 
councilmen yet run against the city it troubles me the treasury 
of the city is going to be exposed and the taxpayers of the city 
are going to feel the burden 
one thing it denies is the political martyrdom of the 
councilmen they were slated to go to jail on sunday their 
personal fines have ceased but the city is going to plummet to 
bankruptcy so their onus is their duty to the city their personal 
political martyrdom has been denied them

nine million japanese climbed down ladders ran 
through smokefilled tunnels and wheeled bedridden patients to 
safety as the country rehearsed for a massive earthquake that 
experts say could strike at any time 
thursday was the 65th anniversary of the great kanto earthquake 
when a temblor estimated at 79 on the richter scale jolted the 
crowded plain surronding tokyo and killed 140000 people 
authorities hoping to hold down casualties in the event of 
another massive quake mobilized schoolchildren civic groups and 
office workers for the tenth disaster prevention drill 
fire departments and officials from the national land agency and 
local governments coordinated evacuation scenarios in the aftermath 
of two imaginary temblors a second great kanto earthquake of 
magnitude 79 and a jolt along the heavily populated 170mile 
tokai belt linking tokyo and nagoya that would measure 80 on the 
richter scale 
the number of participants doesnt change much but each year 
weve been getting better and better at holding the drill said 
takanori kobiki head of the national land agencys disaster 
prevention operations 
scientists say japan is likely to suffer a tremendous earthquake 
within the next 20 years 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage

the national highway traffic safety 
administration says it will conduct research aimed at coming up 
with rules to protect the drivers of light vehicles from 
unreasonable risk of rollover 
the nhtsa decision was announced thursday in a case centering on 
the suzuki samurai under attack from consumer groups for an 
alleged tendency to roll over in curves 
the safety board rejected a petition by the center for auto 
safety a consumers group that wanted a recall of the samurai 
saying the samurai is no more likely to roll than other comparable 
vehicles the agency however approved a petition from the 
consumers union to study the light vehicle rollover problem in 
general 
suzuki responded to the decision by saying it showed that the 
allegations against the samurai were unfounded 
the federal governments action supports suzukis claim that 
the samurai is safe and should put to rest the inaccurate and 
misleading attacks on the vehicle said a statement from the 
japanese companys us subsidiary american suzuki motor corp in 
brea calif 
about 169000 samurais have been sold in the united states 
suzuki said 
the center for auto safety which is often at odds with 
automakers and their regulators said the decision skirted the 
issue 
if this were the law then the justice department would refuse 
to prosecute one mass murderer because there are other mass 
murderers the center said citing reports of 113 rollovers 120 
injuries and 25 deaths involving the samurai 
the center said it would ask nhtsa to reconsider its decision 
nhtsa said it granted the consumers union petition because that 
request did not specify a single cause of samurai rollovers and 
acknowledged that factors other than the stability of the vehicles 
lay behind some of the accidents 
many of the instances of rollover involving the samurai happened 
when the driver had been drinking was unfamiliar with the vehicle 
or was attempting a risky maneuver nhtsa said 
nhtsa listed 10 research projects into vehicle stability it has 
completed or plans to complete but said the research does not 
guarantee that new regulations will be issued 
in rejecting the centers request for a samurai recall nhtsa 
said the samurais rollover rate based on a study of 1986 and 
1987model vehicles was six per 100000 vehicles it said the ford 
bronco ii by comparison had a rollover rate of about 19 per 
100000 vehicles the general motors s10 blazer and s15 jimmy had 
rollover rates identical to the samurais 
the consumers union in june urged a ban on the samurai and in 
its magazine consumer reports rated the vehicle not 
acceptable the first such rating given an automobile in 10 years 
the ensuing publicity cut into samurai sales and resulted in 
several lawsuits

meteorologist milo 
radulovich crawls out of his pup tent each morning at 4 to see if 
the weather will bring any relief to firefighters working in the 
scorched pines of yellowstone 
but the prognosis here and across much of the tinderdry west 
is bleak on the eve of labor day weekend after a droughtplagued 
summer that has produced the most devastating fires in the parks 
history 
were dead in the water through the 10th of september 
radulovich said thursday 
he picked up a national weather chart and pointed toward the 
pacific no major storms were in sight to bring moisture to the 
parched forests of wyoming and montana and temperatures were 
expected to be above normal perhaps in the 90s for at least the 
next five days 
the only bright spot calm winds were expected which could 
limit the spread of flames 
the weather outlook means more long days for firefighters 
battling six major blazes in yellowstone which have charred more 
than a halfmillion acres of the 22 millionacre park this summer 
yellowstone reopened its south gate thursday for the first time 
in almost two weeks meaning all five park gates were usable all 
park roads also were open though officials said worsening fire 
conditions could cause temporary closures 
elsewhere in the west fires continued to burn woodland and 
brush in montana utah washington oregon idaho and california 
weather determines if a fire will crackle quietly along the 
forest floor or rage explosively through the tree tops forecasters 
like radulovich try to keep firefighters a few steps ahead of 
mother nature 
he is one of about 20 national weather service forecasters who 
specialize in mesometeorology the art and science of making 
pinpoint predictions based on broadbrush weather charts 
we take those together with observations in the field and 
bring it down to the scale of 100000 acres he said 
based in sacramento calif radulovich 60 is assigned to 
western yellowstones north fork fire which has burned more than 
109000 acres since it entered the park july 23 
his early start each day gives him a chance to review the latest 
national weather map which comes in via a small satellite dish 
next to his tent 
his office a few steps away is the cab of a rental truck 
parked in the midst of a bustling firefighters camp at 
yellowstones madison campground 
radulovich makes his predictions after checking instruments that 
monitor temperature humidity wind speed and direction 
he and his assistant jeanne hoadley work closely with dave 
thomas a us forest service fire management officer who compares 
weather conditions with what he knows about the forests dryness 
they brief firefighting officials at 6 am then return to the 
van to prepare the next forecast 
there may be two to four briefings a day between which 
radulovich and thomas squeeze in field trips to check local wind 
patterns temperatures and other variables their day typically 
ends at about 1130 pm 
yellowstones fires are thriving on a steady diet of low 
humidity high temperatures and forests baked dry by the areas 
worst recorded drought 
ive worked on fires for 21 years and ive never seen things 
so dry said thomas who is based in western montanas lolo 
national forest 
fuel moisture a measure of how much water the wood contains 
has dropped at times to 3 percent in yellowstone about the same 
as kilndried furniture thomas said 
predicting the weathers effects in such a fireprone area is 
tricky business 
canyons can funnel winds accelerating them until they pump up a 
fire like a blacksmiths bellows radulovich said temperature 
inversions can make smoke hug the ground 
radulovich has been forecasting weather for forest fires since 
1962 and is among the best at interpreting the quirky little kinks 
that can throw off predictions thomas said 
you have to be accurate or you dont survive in this kind of 
forecasting radulovich said firefighters who work close to 
blazing timber take calculated risks based largely on what they 
think the wind may do 
their confidence in you is really important radulovich 
said they make decisions of life and death

chinese and soviet officials today said they 
found some common ground in justconcluded talks on cambodia but 
achieved no breakthroughs in resolving the 10year cambodian 
conflict 
im satisfied with the negotiations weve had soviet vice 
minister igor rogachev told reporters at the airport we have now 
more common points but that does not mean we have no points of 
difference 
the chinese deputy foreign minister tian zengpei said the 
talks which ended thursday were beneficial in deepening the 
mutual understanding between the two countries on their positions 
on cambodia 
rogachev and tian speaking to reporters at the airport before 
rogachevs departure for moscow both refused to go into detail 
about the differences 
the fiveday meeting in beijing was the first time the two sides 
have met solely to discuss vietnams 10year occupation of 
cambodia upon his arrival in beijing on sunday rogachev said he 
thought a breakthrough in resolving chinesesoviet differences on 
cambodia was at hand 
the cambodian problem is the major barrier to normalization of 
relations between the two communist giants and to their first 
summit in 29 years the nations severed relations in the early 
1960s over strategic and ideological differences 
china the chief backer of the antivietnamese resistance in 
cambodia has called on the soviet union which supports vietnam 
to pressure hanoi for an early and total withdrawal of its troops 
vietnam in may agreed to withdraw 50000 troops by the end of 
this year and its remaining forces by 1990 
china has repeatedly expressed doubt over the sincerity of the 
vietnamese promise and tian was skeptical about next years 
pullout 
we will wait and see what they do he said 
according to tian the soviets agreed in principle with 
chinas stand that a fourparty coalition government made up of 
the three resistance factions and the hanoiestablished government 
in phnom penh should be set up following vietnams withdrawal 
rogachev said only we will approve the decision that will be 
taken by the cambodians themselves they must decide 
rogachev said the cambodian issue will be taken up by the soviet 
and chinese foreign ministers at a meeting in new york later this 
month 
he added that another round of talks would be held next year 
but a date and place have not been decided

nobel prizewinner luis w alvarez a 
brilliant wideranging physicist who helped develop the atomic 
bomb and a controversial theory that asteroids or comets wiped out 
the dinosaurs has died at age 77 
alvarez died at his home in this san francisco bay college town 
late wednesday after a long battle with cancer it was announced 
thursday 
colleagues described alvarez as a scientific renaissance man 
whose colorful career took him from wartime radar systems to ufo 
sightings secrets of an egyptian pyramid and an analysis of the 
assassination of president kennedy 
luis alvarez was a stunningly creative individual david a 
shirley director of lawrence berkeley laboratory said thursday 
his discoveries and inventions spanned an amazing range of the 
frontiers of mans knowledge over more than half a century 
alvarez who worked at the laboratory and the university of 
california died of complications from operations for esophageal 
cancer laboratory spokeswoman mary barberia said quoting the 
physicists widow janet 
his health had declined since surgery for a benign brain tumor 
last fall the spokeswoman said 
alvarez won the nobel prize in physics in 1968 for developing 
the liquidhydrogen bubble chamber and for discovering numerous 
atomic particles with the device the chamber is filled with a 
transparent liquid so that charged particles and their collisions 
can be studied by photographing the bubbles and boiling that occur 
along their paths 
in the late 1970s alvarez made headlines with the theory that 
asteroids or comets striking the earth 65 million years ago killed 
the dinosaurs by kicking up huge dense clouds of dust and smoke 
alvarez and colleagues who developed the hypothesis including 
his geologist son walter argued that the clouds blocked sunlight 
lowering temperatures destroying food plants and resulting in the 
extinction of dinosaurs and many other species 
the theory which challenged the longheld view that dinosaurs 
were unsuited for survival in the darwinian evolutionary scheme 
triggered a bitter scientific debate that continues to this day 
others argue that volcanic eruptions killed the dinosaurs by 
darkening the sun 
alvarez labeled one critic a weak sister and accused others 
of publishing scientific nonsense 
his theory got a boost last week when new evidence from a study 
of ancient clay was reported in the british journal nature 
the hypothesis has a chilling modernday counterpart a theory 
that that an atomic war would produce enough smoke to plunge earth 
into a cold dark nuclear winter that would wipe out any 
survivors 
alvarez a san francisco native was the son of walter c 
alvarez a noted physician and medical columnist at the mayo clinic 
in rochester minn 
he wrote in his 1987 autobiography alvarez adventures of a 
physicist that he was indebted to his father who told him it was 
a good idea to take a night off now and then to do nothing but 
think 
as an undergraduate at the university of chicago alvarez built 
one of the first geiger counters in the united states as a 
graduate student he used it to study cosmic rays and proved 
radiation from space consists mostly of protons 
he began working at berkeley in 1936 his discoveries included 
the capture of electrons by atomic nuclei and the radioactivity of 
tritium an isotope of hydrogen used in thermonuclear weapons 
during world war ii alvarez invented an effective bomb sight 
and a number of radar systems his invention of a groundcontrolled 
approach landing system saved the lives of many allied pilots some 
of whom thanked him after the war according to californiaberkeley 
alvarez played an important role in developing the atomic bomb 
and invented several types of atom smashers 
in his autobiography he nostalgically recalled the early days 
of atomic research when he held a sphere of radioactive plutonium 
in his hands feeling its warmth 
alvarez made news by applying physics to popular subjects 
including the xray scan of an egyptian pyramid for hidden chambers 
there were none and analysis of evidence in the kennedy 
assassination his findings supported the warren commissions 
conclusion that lee harvey oswald was the lone assassin 
university of california president david p gardner said 
thursday that he and the entire university community were saddened 
by the death of alvarez whom he called a creative and energetic 
scientist 
gardner said alvarez showed concern for the student 
commitment to meaningful and distinctive research and devotion to 
the betterment of society he will be missed 
alvarez is survived by his wife janet two sons two daughters 
two sisters and a brother

premier karoly grosz said 300 miners 
who staged a rare strike in southern hungary had lawful demands 
but he warned against other work stoppages 
in a speech on miners day an annual fixture in the soviet 
bloc grosz on thursday shifted blame from his communist government 
to the management of the komlo mine for failing to meet miners 
grievances 
workers at the komlo mine about 100 miles south of budapest 
went on strike aug 23 
the miners complained that a personal income tax introduced in 
hungary on jan 1 sliced annual bonuses by 30 percent to 50 
percent the tax is part of groszs efforts to curb an 18 billion 
foreign debt and stimulate the economy 
workers returned to the job after the government promised to try 
to resolve the problem over the tax 
officials said the strike the first worker challenge to groszs 
stringent eoconomic policies was regrettable but 
understandable in view of economic hardships under a government 
austerity program 
for the nonpayment of the full sum of bonuses due the 
responsibility belongs not to the government but on the local 
management which took a wrongly interpreted economic and political 
decision grosz said 
we are looking into this question and will try to find a 
solution the official mti news agency quoted him as saying 
grosz who told the meeting he was in favor of radical reforms 
to heal the ailing economy criticized company managers of not 
economizing correctly on the funds available for dsitribution 
among the miners 
but in a clear warning and in a bid to curb other potential 
strikes grosz said he did not believe threats would produce any 
results 
i would contest that the stopping of work would provide 
the correct emphasis to express political demands as there are 
also those who believe that by using such methods they can acquire 
undue advantages grosz was quoted as saying 
the strike coincided with labor unrest in poland hundreds of 
polish miners work in hungarian shafts but the official media did 
not say if any poles were involved in the 20hour stoppage at the 
komlo mine 
the mining industry in hungary has been crippled for at least 10 
years due to producion lags financial problems and a growing labor 
shortage 
hungarys official trade unions have been critical of recent 
economic policy emphasizing that workers retirees and the 
unemployed must be protected against inflation already at 18 
percent this year

what are the issues so far pledge of allegiance furloughs 
death penalty are you kidding cuomo said on a flight from

with the flap of the french tricolor and the pop 
of champagne corks 27 french automobiles cruised around tiananmen 
square today to celebrate the completion of the first 
paristobeijing car rally 
the rally began july 12 in paris and covered more than 11000 
miles through 12 countries 
the participants 58 men and 10 women from france belgium and 
germany crossed deserts some rainy places rivers plateaus and 
many many mountains to reach our goal said alain lafeuillade 
the trips organizer 
they also bumped into combat troops in iraq and braved the roads 
of pakistan where the drivers are like a crazy frenchman whos 
late for dinner said christophe de scheemaecker a 23yearold 
from antwerp belgium 
the trip marks the first time that a car rally of this size has 
bridged europe and asia lafeuillade said the last time such a 
feat was attempted was the 1931 yellow crusade of citroen which 
was abandoned after many of the cars broke down in mountainous 
pakistan the drivers rode out on camels 
this time driving the renault 5 or the peugoet 205 the 
roadsters averaged 10 hours a day behind the wheel for a total of 
about 600 hours each 
a lot of the time we spent driving by ourselves stopping in 
places that interested us and then catching up with the rest of the 
pack de scheemaecker said 
once in yugoslavia after 17 hours straight behind the wheel de 
scheemaecker lost control of the vehicle and it smashed into a 
mountainside 
we thought we had to leave the race but a mechanic flew in 
from belgium and we were back on the road after a day he said 
in all four of the original 31 cars didnt make it to beijing 
two dying in the mountains of pakistan and two more falling victim 
to the chinese deserts the gobi and the taklamakan 
karine hervieu a 21yearold travel agent from brittany 
france remembers an encounter with iraqi troops 62 miles from the 
warfront with iran 
we gave them a message of peace she said for us it was 
a very important moment 
babette shily 28 from paris remembers leaving pakistan and 
finding out that two days later president mohammad zia ulhaq had 
been killed 
we always seemed just a day or two ahead of disaster she 
said it was the same in india too 
days after some of the cars left northern india an earthquake 
hit both india and nepal killing hundreds 
we saw everything on this trip floods droughts soldiers 
shily said 
hervieu said most of the trip the drivers were allowed to go 
wherever they wanted except in syria iraq and china 
we could understand iraq because they have a war and syria 
wasnt a problem because it was so brief she said but the 
chinese have gone too far with their control 
hervieu and others said the chinese forced them to drive in a 
single line once they crossed into china from kunjirap pakistan 
its like one big parade they wont let us break away she 
said 
the participants aged 18 to 30 were all responsible for 
raising their own money for the trip organizers said 
they worked in banks restaurants whatever lafeuillade 
said then theyd get a garage to sponsor them and poof 
theyd be on the road

a gungho navy lieutenant accused of 
dereliction of duty in the drowning of a rescueswimmer trainee was 
acquitted in the courtmartial he sought in an effort to exonerate 
himself 
all i can say is the military justice system worked a 
smiling lt thomas torchia said after the verdict thursday night 
the system that charged me found me innocent 
a fourofficer panel found the 32yearold princeton ill man 
innocent of two counts of dereliction of duty after deliberating 3 
hours in the weeklong trial 
torchia was in charge of the navy rescue swimmer school at the 
pensacola naval air station when airman recruit lee mirecki 19 of 
appleton wis died march 2 in a training pool 
instructors threw a panicstricken mirecki back into the pool 
after he climbed out and shouted that he wanted to quit the 
voluntary training witnesses said 
mirecki who had a phobia about being pulled under water 
suffered a fearinduced heart attack before drowning a navy 
pathologist testified in torchias trial 
a panel may be selected today for the courtmartial of a second 
defendant petty officer 2nd class michael combe 28 of tempe 
ariz who is accused of holding mireckis head under water he 
faces more serious charges of involuntary manslaughter battery and 
conspiracy to commit battery 
torchia had been offered unspecified nonjudicial punishment 
but turned it down and sought the courtmartial in an effort to 
clear his name 
if convicted he could have been fined two months pay been 
reprimanded and lost seniority for promotion the penalty would 
have put torchias career on the line said a defense lawyer 
retired navy capt ferdinand salomon 
torchia said he plans to stay in the navy and expects a new 
assignment soon as an aviation maintenance officer 
torchia whom a prosecutor described as a gungho rescue 
swimmer said he hoped the highly publicized mirecki case hadnt 
caused people to lose faith in navy training which he called the 
best in the world 
torchia was acquitted largely because of the testimony of a 
prosecution witness said one of his defense lawyers retired navy 
capt ferdinand salomon 
lt cmdr steve matthews a water survival and aerospace 
physiologist testified for the prosecution wednesday that brute 
force and highstress tactics used at the school were unnecessary 
and counterproductive 
in closing arguments salomon pointed out that matthews and 
other training officers had been working for months since the 
drowning to correct problems plaguing the school long before 
torchia took over 
yet lt tom torchia an ordinary flight officer who is not a 
training expert and who had been on the job only 83 days is being 
branded a criminal for not figuring it all out salomon said 
testimony indicated several of torchias superiors had visited 
the school but that no one raised objections to procedures or 
questioned safety until after the death 
in his closing argument the lead prosecutor lt cmdr larry 
wynne said torchia should not have been excused by following 
longestablished procedures 
the defenses position was if it had been that way before it 
was ok wynne told the panel 
each man is responsible for his own watch wynne said 
urging the panel to put aside any empathy they may have for a 
fellow officer and decide the case according to military law 
after the verdict prosecutors immediately left the courtroom 
and were unavailable for comment 
besides the two courtmartial cases the investigation also led 
to nonjudicial punishment for five other navy men including a 
letter of reprimand to torchias former boss nowretired capt 
cl lavinder who had headed the naval aviation schools command

after three years on the increase measles is on 
its way down again but health experts say its too early to tell 
if the disease might finally be on the decline for good 
the national centers for disease control said thursday that 
3652 cases of the oncecommon childhood disease were reported in 
1987 down 42 percent from the previous year its the first drop 
in measles reporting since the record low of 1497 cases in 1983 
measles has fallen 99 percent since the era before measles 
vaccine was licensed in 1963 and the disease was thought headed 
for eradication when the record low came in 1983 but the case 
count then surprised researchers by going back up in 1984 85 and 
86 
researchers cannot say just what the latest drop in measles 
really means said dr bradley hersh a cdc measles specialist the 
disease could continue to show little peaks and valleys for the 
next decade he noted 
we dont really know he said we feel now that the 
vaccine is very good and very effective but there are problems we 
are having in the people unvaccinated in the inner cities and 
the vaccine failures in the schoolage children 
the cdc said 1010 of the cases or 28 percent were 
theoretically preventable occurring in people who should have been 
vaccinated but werent mostly preschool children in urban areas 
nearly threefourths of the cases 2642 were classified as 
nonpreventable occurring in patients who had been vaccinated but 
got measles anyway most of those patients were older 
schoolchildren 
weve got two fronts hersh said the young kids in 
those preventable cases and the vaccine failure in older 
children 
the atlantabased agency said thursday its expert consultants 
still believe the elimination of measles in the united states 
should be pursued but the two lingering problems the 
nonvaccinated and the vaccine failures will require different 
solutions 
increased efforts are needed to vaccinate preschoolaged 
children particularly in innercity areas the cdc said in its 
weekly report innovative strategies are needed to increase 
immunization levels in these populations 
meanwhile the cdc said aggressive revaccination strategies 
may be needed during measles outbreaks to eliminate the socalled 
nonpreventable cases in alreadyvaccinated children 
such a revaccination would involve a rapid program of additional 
shots for most children vaccinated before 1980 when new 
vaccination recommendations and new vaccine techniques began to 
improve the protection somewhat hersh said 
twentynine percent of last years cases occurred among patients 
under 5 another 29 percent occurred in the 1519 age group 
researchers have reports on how twothirds of the patients got 
the measles 53 percent of them acquired the disease in primary and 
secondary schools while others picked it up in day care 
universities at home or in other settings 
threefourths of the cases 2759 were reported from eight 
locations new york city 469 cases california 809 texas 452 
new mexico 318 illinois 213 missouri 190 new hampshire 162 
and wisconsin 146 fewer than 9 percent of the nations counties 
reported measles cases

a 200pound gorilla made an 
impossible escape from its enclosure at the kansas city zoo by 
scaling a wall forcing the evacuation of about 200 people 
authorities said 
the 13yearold gorilla named molly climbed the wall 
clambered onto a roof and then jumped down to walk into the ape 
house entrance normally used by humans 
at the time there were no people nearby said zoo director 
ralph waterhouse the zoo was closed for about 1 hours and about 
200 people evacuated as workers dealt with the gorilla 
workers at the zoo locked the ape house doors and blocked them 
with trucks and closed other openings with plywood the gorilla was 
then tranquilized 
it still appears to be impossible waterhouse said about the 
escape she is extremely athletic 
earlier in the summer she propped a skinny tree branch in the 
corner of her outdoor exhibit and climbed to another brief spell of 
freedom

a veterans group criticized a new report by the 
federal centers for disease control that suggests most vietnam gis 
escaped heavy exposure to the poison dioxin unless they handled 
the herbicide agent orange 
this study seems to be pretty much the same data that was 
released a year ago only a year ago it was portrayed rather 
differently said barry kasinitz a spokesman for the 
35000member vietnam veterans of america 
the cdc last year concluded that exposure to dioxin could not be 
determined using military records of troop locations and spraying 
of agent orange which contained the deadly poison 
now they are jumping to the conclusion that very few 
people were exposed kasinitz said thursday in a telephone 
interview from washington that was a bit of a jump in logic that 
doesnt seem to be substantiated 
the cdcs new report in todays journal of the american medical 
association describes a comparison of blood tests between 646 
vietnam veterans and 97 nonvietnam veterans 
current tcdd dioxin levels were nearly identical in vietnam 
and nonvietnam veterans the researchers said 
the latest study deliberately drew vietnam veterans from 
battalions that had served in areas most heavily sprayed with agent 
orange around saigon in 1967 and 1968 the cdc said 
only two vietnam veterans or 03 percent of all 646 tested had 
blood dioxin levels greater than 20 parts per trillion considered 
clearly elevated the researchers said 
these two men each reported their health status as excellent 
and did not attribute any health problems to agent orange 
exposure the researchers added 
the two men were not among the 14 percent of the vietnam 
veterans in the study group who did link health problems to 
exposure 
this study is consistent with other studies and suggests that 
most us army ground troops who served in vietnam were not heavily 
exposed to tcdd dioxin except perhaps men whose job involved 
handling herbicides the researchers said 
but kasinitz said the new report gives the unfortunate 
impression that small exposures to dioxin were harmless which has 
not been proven and that there is no need for the government to 
act to assist those that have been harmed 
dioxin stays in the bloodstream for many years and high levels 
of the chemical can be measured with blood tests as long as two 
decades after someone has been exposed the researchers said 
agent orange was used as a defoliant in southeast asia during 
the 1960s by the us military some vietnam veterans contend it 
has caused them such health problems as cancer immune system 
disorders and birth defects in their children 
the us supreme court just two months ago cleared the last 
legal obstacle to a multimilliondollar settlement that could 
benefit up to 250000 vietnam veterans in a classaction lawsuit 
against the seven manufacturers of agent orange 
but scientists are still trying to settle a continuing 
controversy over exactly what health effects the dioxin in agent 
orange may have 
dioxin is known to be one of the most powerful causes of cancer 
in laboratory animals ever tested it has not been shown to cause 
cancer in humans but the environmental protection agency 
classifies it as a probable carcinogen

a swollen tributary of the ganges river 
in the capital today reached its highest level in 34 years 
officials said as soldiers and volunteers worked to build dams 
against the rising waters 
at least 64 people died nationwide since thursday bringing to 
748 the nationwide death toll from floods that began with the 
monsoon rains in june newspapers reported today 
the flood waters swept away children sank boats and leveled 
houses newspapers reported scores of people died after being 
bitten by snakes that had crawled to higher ground they said 
no deaths were reported in dhaka where flood waters ranged from 
several inches downtown to 6 feet on the outskirts 
hundreds of thousands of people left their waterlogged houses 
in dhaka many moving in with relatives or into government shelters 
highways and rail lines remained under water while drinking 
water supplies were cut off in 12 outlying districts of dhaka 
because the pumps were submerged according to city officials who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
by this morning the buriganga river was nearly 3 inches above 
flood stage its highest level in 34 years said the flood 
forecast and warning center it predicted the river would rise 
another 8 inches by nightfall 
some lowincome city residents have started hoarding food but 
there were few other signs of panic officials said 
there is no shortage of food right now but the water is 
making transportation virtually impossible president hussain 
muhammad ershad told reporters thursday 
as the river threatened to engulf the city the army and 
volunteers shored up a dam along the 10mile road leading from 
dhaka to the town of narayanganj students from dhaka university 
which shut down until sept 15 joined the relief effort 
at dhaka airport foreign airlines were advised to delay flights 
today because a part of the main runway was covered with 1 to 2 
inches of water said an airport official smaller domestic planes 
used a short dry part of the strip to take off and land said the 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
there has been little rain in dhaka in the past week but the 
buriganga rose quickly as flood waters from the north of the 
country surged south 
a ferry with about 700 people aboard sank wednesday night at the 
dock in chandpur about 40 miles southeast of dhaka and five 
people were missing and feared dead police in chandpur said 
salvage workers entered the ferry friday and found no bodies the 
police said

airboats fanned out over lake okeechobee 
for the first statewide alligator hunt in 26 years a 30day 
reprieve aimed at thinning out the once endangered species whose 
thick hides fetch 42 a foot 
we could have filled our 15gator limit tonight warren 
schafer boasted about four hours after the hunting season opened 
thursday night he displayed his prey three gators ranging from 
seven to 10 feet long 
it wasnt as hard as other animals ive hunted said 
schafer 45 of miami a veteran biggame hunter 
across florida starting at sundown more than 200 hunters 
selected by the state began to search for their redeyed prey with 
flashlights and head lamps 
harpoons snares and bows and arrows are about the only weapons 
permitted most alligators are taken alive their jaws secured with 
duct tape and are delivered to processing plants still kicking 
some are killed with a bangstick a device that shoots a 
cartridge on impact guns are prohibited because the gators often 
sink after being shot 
on lake okeechobee hunters reporters and a few sightseers 
departed under the din of airboats and through a mist churned up by 
their large propellers bugs fluttered about like snowflakes in the 
hunters lights 
thomas alpern 25 a freelance writer from new york city said 
to be the only northerner who received a permit was still 
searching for his first alligator at midnight with the aid of a 
professional trapper 
who knows he said maybe i wont even be able to kill it 
once we find one 
but alpern like many hunters couldnt ignore the profitable 
side of the hunt in addition to the lucrative hides gator meat 
sells for up to 6 a pound 
the money is the big factor said rodney crawford a 
19yearold cook from lake worth who will hunt on lake george in 
florida 
state game officers are closely monitoring the hunt for poachers 
and permitholders using illegal weapons or taking gators below the 
4foot minimum length 
since federal antipoaching methods were adopted in 1970 the 
alligator population in florida has about doubled to an estimated 1 
million nearly 1000 gators have been captured in experimental 
hunts since 1981 and the september season will be isolated to 28 
districts where the alligator population is extraordinarily high 
tom stice a biologist with the state game and fresh water fish 
commission said a cross section of the public was sought for the 
hunt to expand interest in alligators 
the 238 hunters selected from about 5000 applications 
attended a sixhour statesponsored training session and signed 
liability waivers 
stice estimated the hunters will capture 65 to 70 percent of the 
possible maximum of 3450 
for state wildlife officials the hunt follows a nearly 20year 
effort to preserve the florida alligator which averages about 10 
feet in length 
the last stateapproved hunt for sport was in 1962 when the 
american alligator was declared endangered and hunting alligators 
in florida was banned as its numbers increased however officials 
downgraded the alligator from endangered to threatened and the 
state gradually relaxed hunting restrictions 
people are getting gator phobia said lee kramer of delray 
beach who captures nuisance alligators for the state i got a 
call the other day in boca raton and it turned out to be an 
inflatable pool alligator that blew into a ditch 
allan woodward head of alligator research for the game 
commission theorized that the alligator population was not as 
decimated as previously thought during the height of poaching in 
the 1960s 
theyve really surprised us he said theyre a pretty 
hardy animal

a federal appeals court upheld the 
espionage convictions and 365year prison sentence of exnavy 
radioman jerry whitworth a member of the walker spy ring that 
passed military secrets to the soviets 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled 30 thursday that 
the punishment fit whitworths crime of selling ultrasensitive 
navy decoding and communications information to the soviet union 
the sentence imposed by us district judge john vukasin 
viewed in the abstract would appear harsh the court said 
this sentence however is not disproportionate to whitworths 
crimes 
whitworth 49 of davis calif a radioman with a topsecret 
clearance for much of his 18year navy career was convicted in 
1986 of seven counts of espionage for supplying ultrasensitive 
decoding and communications information to spymaster john walker 
for nearly a decade in exchange for 332000 
vukasin called whitworth one of the most spectacular spies of 
the century and imposed the nations harshest sentence for 
espionage since julius and ethel rosenberg convicted of conspiring 
to furnish atomic bomb secrets to the soviets were electrocuted in 
1953 
whitworths sentence forbids parole consideration for 60 years 
in the decision the court rejected defense arguments that a 
sentence longer than walkers amounted to cruel and unusual 
punishment 
military and intelligence officials testified at the trial that 
the spy ring had revealed the navys most precious secrets and 
caused damage that may be impossible to calculate 
walker also recruited his son and brother as members of the spy 
ring he pleaded guilty in a baltimore federal court to spying for 
the soviets for 17 years and was sentenced to life in prison with 
parole possible in 10 years 
the opinion by judge robert boochever said the us constitution 
does not require a judge in one court to compare a defendants 
relative guilt to that of a defendant in another court on separate 
charges before imposing sentence 
even if comparison of guilt was required boochever said the 
court notes that whitworth kept walkers espionage operation alive 
for nearly a decade and himself became a central figure because of 
his access to highly classified material 
whitworths chief prosecutor former assistant us attorney 
william farmer commented the sentence was not harsh at all if 
this had been a case where there was a death penalty available it 
clearly would have been prosecuted as a capital case 
assistant us attorney sanford svetcov who represented the 
prosecution on appeal agreed that whitworth deserved a death 
sentence which was abolished for espionage and other federal 
crimes by a 1972 supreme court ruling 
its a sickness in our society that we have people willing to 
do harm to their own country for money svetcov said these 
guys were not communists by any means they were strictly in it for 
profit 
whitworths lawyer on appeal alan caplan said he was 
disappointed by the ruling and would appeal he said he was 
astounded by the courts conclusion that the verdict was not 
influenced when walker was improperly allowed to speculate on the 
witness stand that whitworth must have known the secrets were being 
delivered to the soviet union 
walker also a former navy radioman with a topsecret clearance 
testified that he had started selling secrets to a soviet agent in 
1968 and recruited whitworth as his chief supplier of classified 
materials in 1974 after walker himself no longer had direct access 
to the material 
whitworth was convicted of furnishing to walker the secrets of 
navy decoding equipment code keys and communications systems that 
whitworth gathered and photographed for nearly a decade as a highly 
placed radio officer at ship and shore stations

the us supreme court has refused to halt 
mounting daily fines against the city for blocking a federal 
housing desegregation plan a decision the mayor says could cause 
yonkers to plummet to bankruptcy 
but in a ruling issued thursday night the court temporarily 
spared the four city councilmen who oppose the plan from going to 
jail until they have time to ask formally that their cases be fully 
reviewed us supreme court spokeswoman toni house said 
the justices stayed a lower court ruling that had upheld 
contempt citations against the four councilmen who had faced a 
resumption of 500aday fines and the start of jail terms this 
weekend 
the citys fines for failing to comply with the desegregation 
order were put on hold until today pending the supreme courts 
ruling the fines will now resume against the city yonkers mayor 
nicholas wasicsko said 
the fines started aug 2 at 100 and doubled daily the city had 
paid 12700 before receiving its first stay from an appeals court 
which upheld the contempt finding last friday but granted an 
additional oneweek stay it also capped the citys fines at 1 
million a day 
house said the entire court considered the applications from the 
councilmen and the city and the application so far as the city 
of yonkers is concerned has been denied 
justices thurgood marshall and william brennan filed a 12page 
dissent arguing that all stays be denied she said 
as the city repeatedly points out in its application yonkers 
is relatively unique in that most of the governmental power in the 
city is centralized in the legislative branch for this reason the 
city is the council marshall wrote 
the ruling surprised wasicsko who favors compliance with the 
desegregation order 
it troubles me he said early today the treasury of the 
city is going to be exposed and the taxpayers of the city are going 
to feel the burden 
one thing it denies is the political martyrdom of the 
councilmen they were slated to go to jail on sunday their 
personal fines have ceased but the city is going to plummet to 
bankruptcy 
so their onus is their duty to the city he added their 
personal political martyrdom has been denied them 
two of the four defiant councilmen nicholas longo and vice 
mayor henry spallone said early today that the decision for 
them was a major victory 
this country went through a revolution a couple hundred years 
ago to make sure that people could cast their votes independently 
and without coercion longo said 
councilman peter chema another one of the four called the 
decision a big personal victory but i have serious concerns 
about the city its kind of like being administered oxygen while 
someone strangles you 
the fourth councilman edward fagan called the decision 
unexpected and declined to comment further 
longo said the four would ask us district judge leonard sand 
who initially found them in contempt to suspend the citys fines 
pending their supreme court hearing which longo said would not be 
until 1989 
the relief becomes moot if he decides to bankrupt the city in 
the interim longo said 
longo and spallone refused to say if they would allow the city 
to go bankrupt rather than change their votes 
in 1985 sand found the city liable for 40 years of segregating 
housing and schools and ordered the city to build 800 units of 
moderateincome housing throughout the city 
sand found them in contempt aug 2 the day after the council 
first rejected the courtordered desegregation plan by a 43 vote 
theyve rejected the plan by the same vote three times since 
bertran f wallace president of the yonkers branch of the 
national association of colored people one of the plaintiffs in 
the original suit against the city said this morning he was not 
very familiar with the ruling 
our greatest concern is to see that the court order issued by 
judge sand is carried out and implemented and that we build the 
homes in a very peaceful and orderly manner he said 
the state emergency financial control board which has taken 
control of the citys spending had said it would seek criminal 
charges against the four councilmen today if the fines are 
reimposed 
spokespeople said this morning that gov mario cuomo and 
secretary of state gail shaffer who chairs the control board 
would not comment until they had seen the high courts ruling 
the criminal charges stem from violating the control board act 
a state law by jeopardizing the citys finances through spending 
money the city they were not authorized to spend 
kevin condon spokesman for a citizens group called comply 
which supports compliance with the desegregation order said the 
ruling is one final indication that the city needs to face reality 
and get on with putting its life back together 
the city and councilmen had a tentative court appearance with 
sand set for 2 pm today it was not known how the supreme court 
ruling would affect the schedule

defense secretary frank carlucci warned 
congress not to act hastily to change the way it reviews defense 
spending in the wake of a major fraud probe involving defense 
contractors and consultants 
lawmakers should not adopt reform proposals being circulated on 
capitol hill including creation of an independent acquisition 
agency removing the inspector general from the department of 
defense and locking the revolving door between the dod and 
defense contractors carlucci said on thursday 
certainly we want to see those found guilty of wrongdoing 
punished and punished severely for their actions but reform 
is really about prevention not punishment carlucci said 
the speech before the baltimore council on foreign affairs was 
the most comprehensive statement to date by the secretary since 
revelations of a widespread investigation of alleged fraud 
involving defense contractors and consultants 
in his prescription for procurement reform carlucci called 
on congress to simplify its budgetmaking process reduce the 
number of committees that oversee defense spending shift the 
pentagon budget to a twoyear cycle and provide multiyear funding 
for more weapon programs 
the goal should be to limit the number of intervention points 
where a skillful lobbyist can succeed in gaining an advantage he 
said 
right now the defense budget bill must complete a 17step 
process to final passage carlucci said each point along the 
way is an opportunity for those bent on exerting improper 
influence 
congress must seek ways to reduce the profusion of 
intervention points on capitol hill that invite improper if not 
always strictly illegal behavior he said 
however rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed 
services committee said the speech failed to address central 
issues of procurement 
since the procurement scandal erupted we have seen people 
selling old ideas that have nothing to do with the procurement 
problem aspin said they are pet rocks dressed up as solutions 
to the scandal but they are still pet rocks i am afraid secretary 
carlucci has fallen into the same trap in his speech billed 
prescription for procurement reform 
his proposal dealt with budget reform not procurement reform 
his suggestions say nothing about the use of consultants the abuse 
of insider information or restoration of the integrity of the 
bidding process the congressman said 
many of his suggestions for budget reform are valid and have 
been pushed by me and others over the years but they have nothing 
to do with procurement reform aspin said 
the justice department investigation which became public in 
june centers on allegations that defense contractors routinely 
used outside consultants to obtain proprietary information on the 
bids of competitors and that the consultants may have paid bribes 
to pentagon employees 
carlucci warned against a legislative rush to enact reforms 
without considering their effects 
at the very least dods critics owe us a hearing before they 
try to pass legislation that could impact our procurement process 
and the defense industrial base for years to come he said 
we need to ask how does the system as it exists today offer 
wrongdoers the opportunity to act and how can we close these 
windows of vulnerability in the procurement process 
carlucci said establishment of an independent acquisition agency 
by congress would erect barriers between the acquisition process 
and those in the pentagon who know best what weapons they need 
likewise the defense department relies on the revolving 
door that brings experts from the industry into government 
carlucci said 
we need to police the system for abuses not penalize 
procurement professionals for seeking to build on and benefit from 
their expertise he said 
as for the suggestion that the inspector general should be 
removed from the dod carlucci said it would deprive the 
secretary of defense of the eyes and ears that help him monitor the 
system he is charged with supervising 
the pentagon already has acted to prevent contractors from 
winning contracts unfairly by streamlining its own acquisitions 
chain of command carlucci said

vermont no longer will let convicted drug 
dealers take part in a house arrest program under which john 
zaccaro jr is spending his fourmonth cocaine trafficking term in 
a 1500amonth luxury apartment 
hallelujah said addison county states attorney john quinn 
upon learning of gov madeleine kunins announcement thursday 
i never considered that drug dealers were nonviolent 
offenders i never thought they should be in the house arrest 
program no matter who they are said quinn who prosecuted 
zaccaro and opposed his entry into the program 
the changes do not apply to those already in the house arrest 
program including zaccaro the 24yearold son of former vice 
presidential candidate geraldine ferraro 
kunins announcement followed public outcry over the disclosure 
that zaccaro was living in the maidservice apartment while in the 
program 
the house arrest program allows nonviolent criminals to find 
and pay for their own housing and spend their sentence outside of 
prison while under strict supervision 
zaccaro was convicted in april of selling 25 worth of cocaine 
to an undercover police officer he was sentenced to four months in 
prison but spent only 29 minutes in the chittenden community 
correctional center in july before moving to the montpelier 
apartment 
kunin defended the program overall saying it provided the 
necessary element of punishment and helped to reduce overcrowding 
in vermonts prisons however she said the program must exclude 
drug dealers 
we must have confidence public confidence in the system 
she said i also feel that we have to send a very strong message 
in terms of drug offenders 
under the changes program participants also must spend at least 
24 hours in traditional incarceration before moving to their 
housearrest residences 
kunin said many assumptions about drug offenses have changed 
since the original program guidelines were drafted in 1983 
instead of considering this to be a low to moderate offense as 
it had been in the past it should be moved up because i think 
anyone who sells drugs anywhere in the world in this country in 
the state of vermont is a serious offender kunin said 
corrections commissioner joseph patrissi however told kunin 
that a review of similar house arrest programs in eight other 
states found none barred drug offenders

louie an alaskan king crab is just 
getting a leg up in the racing game but hell be seasoned in a 
maryland crab derby saturday 
louie dubbed king louis the 49th by alaska officials is in the 
field of competitors from 31 states in the governors cup race at 
the 41st national hard crab derby and fair at crisfield md 
alaska won the governors cup in 1968 1972 and 1980 but crab 
handicappers have their doubts about louie they say he may be too 
big and ungainly to cover the 16foot course ahead of the smaller 
blue and dungeness crabs entered by other states 
youre talking about an animal that is large with a heavy 
body weight said bill nippes of the alaska department of fish 
and game take it out of the water and you change the buoyancy 
crabs are very slow on land dungeness crabs are a lot faster 
quicker 
so are chesapeake bay blue crabs nippes said maryland offers 
those to crabless states those entries include the cheese state 
streaker from wisconsin colorado super collider ethan allens 
revenge from vermont peanuts from georgia crabby curt from 
michigan and koa o ke kai from hawaii 
that means warrior of the sea said claude brooks of the 
maryland office of tourism development i hope thats what it 
means i hope it isnt something obscene 
maryland is famous for its crabs but none of its entries has 
won in the 41year history of the derby said race coordinator ruth 
custis 
maybe the maryland blues know something about the postrace 
festivities the other crabs dont 
we eat them custis said laughing we put our famous 
seasoning on them and have a feast

while many other 18yearolds are thinking about 
college courses alonzo j haney iii is thinking about windshield 
wipers and the idea of becoming a millionaire 
haney invented a windshield wiper that already has caught the 
eye of general motors corp he also has his own company hmi inc 
which he says is backed by more than 1 million in investments 
not bad for a teenager who earned cs in high school 
science 
haney who goes by the nickname chip puts himself in some 
respectable company with inventors like thomas edison 
theyre inspirational they defy odds and i guess thats what 
i am doing right now he said in an interview thursday at his 
companys spacious chicago office 
when i look out this window i think a lot about what space of 
the sky i want to go after next said the youth who lives in the 
suburb of north chicago 
his path to fortune began simply he was driving his car to pick 
up his mother from work one rainy day in october 1986 when he 
noticed the windshield wipers didnt work well 
i took out a pad of paper and a pen and i started to sketch 
out new ideas of a better wiper blade haney recalled 
that night the made the first prototype out of a garden hose at 
home 
haney says his wiper can scoop rain ice and snow off a 
windshield and toss the debris as far as four feet it is specially 
designed to hug the windshield more closely than traditional 
wipers he said 
when he found out he would have to pay about 10000 to hire an 
attorney to file a patent application haney decided to do the 
research and application himself 
his patent was approved and haney marched into gms executive 
offices in detroit the day after he graduated from high school last 
year to persuade the giant automaker to use his wiper on gm cars 
company officials have promised to test it 
haney is putting the final touches on a contract with alofs 
manufacturing co of grand rapids mich which will make and 
distribute his invention 
were hoping to have it the contract complete and signed 
next week said alofs owner eugene defouw 
defouw said haneys earnings would be based on the number of 
wipers sold in addition to gm he said a few japanese automakers 
have expressed interest meanwhile he has invented 28 other 
products five of which have patents pending he said 
i spend about 18 hours a day thinking about what i want to 
make haney said i dont date i dont have time for that 
right now 
in his office hang two paintings which haney said tell a lot 
about what motivates him 
one depicts a young black man shirtless and hunched over 
struggling to be taken seriously 
now i can be accepted as an equal but 40 years ago you 
wouldnt have found me in this office said haney who is black 
another painting is of a man playing polo 
i love polo because its very challenging and not everyone can 
do it just like not everyone can be 18 and own a company haney 
said 
joseph n stephenitch who taught haney in business classes at 
warren township high school in suburban gurnee said the youth 
has a scary grasp of business 
haneys mother patricia 43 also is proud of her son 
but it does worry me that hes not with his own age group 
she said he is missing out on a lot and i hope later on after 
he makes his fortune he doesnt regret it

about 300 students protested today to 
demand that the olympics be shared with communist north korea and 
they claimed the games were being used to increase dictatorial rule 
officials said that president roh taewoo plans to release 
dissidents from prison after the olympics 
students from several colleges in the seoul area took part in 
the rally at hongik university and said they would not sit idle 
during the olympics but they did not say if they would attempt to 
disrupt the games 
we oppose the olympics which only help dictator roh 
taewoo the students shouted 
government officials are concerned radicals may stage protests 
during the sept 17oct 2 event the radicals have little public 
support and have been strongly criticized by many koreans in recent 
weeks for staging violent demonstrations 
the onehour rally and short march today were peaceful dozens 
of students took up positions in front of the school for possible 
clashes with police but riot police stayed away 
the students shouted slogans supporting north koreas demand to 
be a cohost at the games 
lets advance national unification by cohosting the 
olympics the students chanted 
north korea has said it will boycott the olympics unless it is 
allowed to be a cohost the international olympic committee said 
the games cannot be shared because they are awarded to a single 
city 
radical students a small but powerful minority on campuses are 
seeking to topple the roh government they have become increasingly 
proleftist as they have lost support among most students and other 
koreans following broad democratic reforms by the government 
south korea and north korea have been bitter rivals since the 
peninsula was divided at the end of world war ii they fought the 
korean war of 195053 that left more than 1 million people dead 
government party officials said roh made the agreement to free 
political prisoners during political talks with party chairman yoon 
giljoong at the presidential residence the officials speaking on 
condition of anonymity did not specify how many prisoners would be 
freed 
in a series of recent meetings kim daejung and three other 
opposition leaders urged roh to speed democratic reforms and 
release all political prisoners 
hundreds of political prisoners have been freed since nationwide 
protests in 1987 forced the government to accept opposition demands 
for reforms 
opposition parties contend more than 500 dissidents still are 
imprisoned or facing trial for antigovernment activity or 
political beliefs the government claims fewer than 100 dissidents 
remain in prison

president virgilio barco in a national 
address offered to start peace talks with leftist guerrillas who 
have attacked two northern colombia towns within a week 
barco told a national television audience thursday night that 
the talks should conclude with the dissolution of guerrilla 
organizations 
guerrillas must stop their terrorist acts human rights 
violations kidnappings and extortions before talks begin barco 
said he said a peace agreement should be reached by march 1990 
when the next presidential and parliamentary elections are 
scheduled 
the offer came two days after guerrillas firing automatic 
assault rifles throwing hand grenades and setting fire to houses 
killed 12 peasants gov jose gabriel amin of cordoba state said 
an estimated 30 guerrillas of the peoples liberation army set 
fire to a ranch killed 10 peasants and wounded 15 tuesday near the 
town of canalete amin said thursday 
canalete is about 320 miles north of bogota 
the insurgents then attacked the nearby village of el tomate 
setting fire to 26 huts and killing two people the governor said 
in a broadcast interview with the colombian radio chain rcn 
in el tomate a village of 600 people the attackers left 
messages painted on walls declaring death to the toads and 
paramilitaries survivors said in interviews with rcn 
guerrillas call army informants toads 
peasants in colombia have long claimed that they are caught 
between the army and the guerrillas 
in dozens of interviews with the associated press peasants have 
told of being forced to sell food and other necessities to 
guerrillas 
often soldiers force the peasants to give information about 
guerrilla movements the peasants say the guerrillas then return 
and kill the peasants accusing them of being army informants the 
peasants have said 
the peoples liberation army and another guerrilla group known

company specializing in educational journeys to unconventional 
destinations including antarctica

sea ice 50 miles northeast of point barrow or about 400 miles 
inside the arctic circle the crew notified canadian maritime

police guarded a funeral 
service in this village today for two ira guerrillas killed by 
british soldiers and rioting occurred for a second night in 
catholic west belfast 
black flags were hung on telephone poles and proira slogans 
were scrawled on walls in loughmacrory 45 miles west of belfast 
brothers gerard harte 29 and martin harte 21 were to be 
buried after a service at st marys roman catholic church and 
26yearold brian mullins funeral was to be held saturday at the 
nearby village of dunmoyle 
police said they were shot and killed in a british army ambush 
tuesday and that the trio was plotting to kill an offduty soldier 
dozens of police with riot shields and batons deployed in the 
village and along the road to the harte family home apparently to 
prevent the ira turning the funeral into an antibritish show of 
strength 
the ira said it honored its dead comrades with a ceremonial 
volley in the loughmacrory area thursday night 
in belfast a police spokesman who demanded anonymity said 
police fired plastic bullets to disperse rioters during violence in 
roman catholic areas of the city that flared thursday night and 
continued early today 
police said that in rioting earlier thursday in a west belfast 
ira stronghold three people were slightly injured and taken to the 
hospital when troops fired plastic bullets at a hostile crowd 
police said the rioting in belfast late thursday and early today 
was not on the scale of riots that broke out wednesday 
in those riots gangs of young ira supporters set fire to a bus 
two vans and more than 35 cars and hurled gasoline bombs and rocks 
at security forces while a gunman fired on the citys new barnsley 
police station 
dozens of burned out vehicles still blocked some roads in the 
area thursday night as groups of youths gathered at street corners 
talking and drinking beer while police and army patrols cruised by 
police said the three slain ira men were armed masked and 
driving in a stolen car when they were ambushed they said gerard 
harte was the commander of the iras midtyrone unit and that 
martin harte was responsible for selecting ira targets from the 
ranks of the police and the ulster defense regiment 
martin harte was arrested during police raids following the aug 
20 bus bombing but was released without charge they said 
the ira in a statement wednesday said the harte brothers and 
mullin 26 were on active service a guerrilla euphemism for 
a bombing or shooting mission when they were slain 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
protestantdominated northern ireland and unite it with the mainly 
catholic republic of ireland under socialist rule 
organizers of sport aid a worldwide charity run scheduled for 
sept 11 announced that the army had withdrawn from participation 
in an event at londons hyde park citing the heightened ira threat 
to military personnel

its last call for stag beer 
terry galati pushed the last case of beer off the stag brewery 
production line at 1 pm thursday ending a brewing era in 
illinois 
as the final case came through a lot of memories flashed in 
my mind said galati a machine operator at stag for 11 years 
i felt bad it was a depressing moment for me 
stag was illinois last fullscale brewery and at 130 years was 
one of the oldest in the midwest the closing put about 200 people 
out of work 
g heileman brewing co which owns stag announced june 27 its 
was closing the brewery because of its age excess capacity at 
other heileman plants and the need to spend 29 million for a 
sewage plant for the brewery 
the lacrosse wisbased beer company and belleville officials 
continue to search for investors willing to reopen the brewery 
mayor richard brauer said last week an unidentified investor was 
considering making an offer to buy the brewery 
but gary perleberg director of planning and development for 
heileman said thursday we have received no offers and i have no 
comment further than that 
heileman bought the brewery from carling national breweries in 
1979 last fall australian brewing giant bond corp holdings ltd 
purchased heileman for 122 billion the company closed a brewery 
in evansville ind earlier this year 
workers who trickled out of the stag plant thursday said they 
were resigned to the closing 
it was very quiet at work today said galati 34 there 
was a lot of hugging and handshaking im going to miss the 
money and working with the guys ive been working with some of 
these guys for so long ill miss seeing them every day 
about 180 employees had been laid off by thursday the remaining 
50 will be kept on indefinitely to handle distribution of the 
remaining stock close the books and maintain equipment in hopes an 
investor will save the plant 
greg beaston 27 said his grandfather father and four brothers 
have worked at the brewery he said he hopes the brewery is 
reopened soon 
the shorter the time it is shut down the quicker it can be 
started back up beaston said

feuding black political 
organizations today signed an agreement aimed at ending the 
countrys bloodiest ongoing conflict in which more than 600 people 
have died in 20 months 
the fighting in natal province has pitted supporters of militant 
antiapartheid organizations against members of inkatha a more 
conservative group headed by prominent zulu leader mangosuthu 
buthelezi 
inkathas secretary general oscar dhlomo and jay naidoo 
secretary general of the militant congress of south african trade 
unions signed the agreement at a courthouse in the provincial 
capital pietermaritzburg 
the labor federation known as cosatu has been allied with the 
united democratic front a nowbanned antiapartheid coalition in 
the feud against inkatha 
the agreement condemns violence and calls for formation of a 
conciliation board which would review residents complaints of 
harassment or attacks the boards members would be selected 
jointly by the two sides and have disciplinary powers 
as part of the agreement each side will drop pending court 
cases accusing the other of violence 
each party recognizes the immediate necessity to make it 
abundantly clear to its members that coastu and inkatha 
categorically condemn acts of intimidation forced recruitment and 
violence the agreement says 
all political organizations have the right to exist and the 
democratic right to espouse their own particular viewpoint it 
says 
most of the fighting has been in the black townships around 
pietermaritzburg but has spread in recent months to townships near 
the larger port city of durban many of the killings have been to 
avenge earlier killings 
both inkatha which claims 15 million members and the united 
democratic frontcosatu alliance oppose the apartheid policies 
which enable south africas 5 million whites to dominate 26 million 
blacks but their strategies differ markedly 
the front a predominantly black coalition of about 600 groups 
advocates economic sanctions strikes and other confrontational 
measures to bring about sweeping political and economic change 
inkatha opposes sanctions avoids militant protest and advocates 
capitalism 
many militants view buthelezi as a government collaborator 
because he is chief minister of the kwazulu homeland however 
buthelezi has rejected invitations by the government to join in 
negotiating reforms that would expand blacks political role while 
leaving whites in ultimate control 
peter kerschoff a social worker in pietermaritzburg who has 
been involved in past reconciliation efforts said the agreement 
was an important but not final step toward ending the conflict 
because of government bans and restrictions it is extremely 
difficult for cosatu and the udf to communicate with grassroots 
people this will have to be addressed he said in a telephone 
interview 
the natal violence has distressed other antiapartheid 
campaigners and caused debate over whether black political groups 
could avoid factional fights and effectively oppose the whiteled 
government 
some commentators viewed the conflict as a harbinger of 
widespread black infighting that might develop as black groups with 
different ideologies struggled for supremacy

a titan rocket today propelled into 
space a secret military payload that a civilian expert identified 
as a satellite capable of eavesdropping on soviet military and 
diplomatic communications 
the powerful 16storytall titan 34d scoring its third 
straight success after being grounded for 18 months thundered from 
its launch pad at 805 am 
the air force did not announce the launch in advance which has 
been its practice on military space flights and afterward said 
only that the titan 34d carrying a classified military 
payload was successfully launched 
john e pike a space policy expert for the washingtonbased 
federation of american scientists said last month the payload 
would be a satellite to monitor soviet missile tests and radio 
telephone radar and other electronic military and diplomatic 
communications 
he said the payload carried an antenna built to unfold to the 
size of a baseball field 
pike said the satellite project originally was codenamed chalet 
but was changed to vortex when chalet became known vortex became 
compromised some time ago and yet another name may have been 
substituted he said 
the titan 34d will remain the nations most powerful unmanned 
rocket until an upgraded version the titan 4 makes its launch 
debut later this year also with a military satellite both are 
made by martin marietta in denver 
a titan 34d carrying a reconnaissance satellite was launched in 
october from vandenberg air force base calif another blasted away 
from cape canaveral a month later and placed in orbit a satellite 
to provide warning of a missile attack 
before the october launch the titan 34d had been grounded 
following two straight explosions of the rocket

hundreds of thousands of antigovernment 
protesters marched today through major cities and demonstrators 
took over dozens of towns across the country sources said 
students and buddhist monks led the protesters in moulmein 50 
miles east of the capital of rangoon a western diplomat said he 
said some protesters occupied local government buildings 
we estimate that up to 40 townships are under the control of 
the people he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
in monywa 400 miles northwest of rangoon an estimated 300000 
people including striking government workers and policemen 
rallied for democracy and rejected the presidents call to return 
to work a resident said 
thousands of people also rallied peacefully in rangoon but far 
fewer were in the streets than the estimated 100000 who rallied 
the day before the demonstrations today were concentrated near two 
major rallying points rangoon general hospital and the us 
embassy 
demonstrators have demanded formation of an interim government 
to lead the country back to democracy president maung maung said 
thursday that this would be unconstitutional but he said the 
ruling party planned a sept 12 congress to consider a referendum 
on ending 26 years of authoritarian singleparty rule 
a leading dissident former defense minister tin oo said today 
it is no longer necessary to hold a referendum the whole country 
has rejected oneparty rule only an interim government will be 
able to ease the situation 
a lawyer speaking for the new league for democracy and peace 
headed by former president win maung said 
it is no time to talk about constitutionality at this stage 
the situation calls for an immediate change of government 
a statement from the rangoon lawyers council said the 
government violated the constitution by shooting demonstrators and 
indefinitely detaining suspects 
it is ridiculous to talk about constitutionality by the 
government that has violated the constitution on various 
occasions it said 
in his speech maung maung also said his government would 
legalize student unions banned since 1962 and rebuild the rangoon 
university student union building which the army destroyed in 
suppressing dissent that year 
but about 3000 students rejected that and marched through the 
streets of the capital they and thousands of others including 
striking government workers shouted the students cause and the 
peoples cause are indivisible 
a 17yearold student leader called maung maungs speech a 
cunning trick to divide students from the people 
we are fighting not only for students rights but for the 
entire people we will continue to demonstrate until the oneparty 
regime is replaced by a democratic regime he said 
the diplomat said protesters have called for the biggest 
demonstrations ever in burma on sept 8 
on thursday night the newly formed committee for democracy 
which is composed of 21 elder statesmen and former military 
officiers called a news conference to air demands for an interim 
government the diplomat said they called on protesters to vacate 
government buildings to avoid confrontation 
the government wednesday warned it would take action against the 
illegal occupiers but the diplomat said there were no signs it was 
carrying out the threat 
traffic has become considerably lighter in rangoon with an 
ongoing strike at the nations oil refineries and a shortage of 
gasoline 
rangoons airport reopened today and union burma airways 
resumed international flights striking employees closed the 
airport thursday further isolating the southeast asian nation 
burmas national airline halted domestic flights on aug 26 
in bangkok thailand a western diplomat said it is only a 
matter of time before former leader ne win flees from burma and 
that the 77yearold exgeneral probably will go either to west 
germany or switzerland 
ne wins departure would lance the boil in burma the 
diplomat said also speaking anonymously 
ne win led the 1962 military coup that ended democracy in burma 
and ushered in authoritarian rule he resigned july 23 taking 
indirect responsibility for bloody studentled riots in march and 
june and he called for a referendum on singleparty rule 
but the ruling burma socialist program party rejected the 
referendum and picked hardliner sein lwin to succeed him 
nationwide antigovernment demonstrations followed and turned 
bloody aug 8 when troops fired on crowds by official count at 
least 112 people were killed in rangoon alone before sein lwin 
resigned aug 12 
one week later maung maung became burmas first civilian leader 
in 26 years but prodemocracy demonstrations continued

9yearold son are the only americans identified among 49 people 
killed in a fiery crash at an air show at a us base air force 
officials said today 
the officials also lowered their death toll from sundays 
disaster earlier they said 52 people died when three italian jet 
fighters collided during the air show and one plowed into a crowd 
at the air force base in ramstein 
west german officials said a badly burned male victim died 
thursday raising the death toll to 49 us and west german 
officials now have the same death toll said base spokeswoman 
monika stuppy 
there was so much confusion at the beginning now we are 
meeting twice a day to coordinate more closely on this ms 
stuppy told the associated press the air force identified the two 
dead americans as joshua frymyer 9 and his mother pfc genevieve 
riggs of the 110th military police co in pirmasens west germany 
the child is survived by his father michael d frymyer of 
lewistown penn an air force statement said 
no ages were available for the parents 
mrs riggs husband army sgt myron riggs 24 who was severely 
burned in the disaster served in the same military police unit as 
his wife he was flown tuesday to brooke army medical center in 
texas the unofficial us military newspaper stars and stripes 
reported 
west german officials said 40 of the dead have been identified 
in addition to the two americans they are 33 west germans a dutch 
citizen a french citizen and the three italian pilots according 
to juergen dietzen spokesman for rhinelandpalatinate state where 
ramstein is located 
dietzen said 172 people remained in hospitals including some 
who had been released and returned after their condition worsened 
at home 
he said the hospitalized victims were 144 west germans 16 
americans two britons and one each from france italy belgium 
portugal africa and the philippines he did not name the african 
country 
four more injured victims were not identified because they were 
unable to communicate due to the severity of their injuries he 
said 
meanwhile a west german medical expert charged today that 
rescue work after the air show disaster was seriously flawed and 
that many burn victims were sent to hospitals incapable of handling 
their injuries 
the organizational handling of the catastrophe was a 
scandal and an unbelievable failure of those responsible said 
leo koslowski an expert on burns and former director of the 
university surgical clinic in tuebingen 
wolfgang herbig director of the nearby kaiserslautern hospital 
where many of the injured were taken said there were not enough 
mobile medical teams available at the air base after the accident 
but officials of rhinelandpalatinate state strongly defended 
the rescue efforts and praised the cooperation between americans 
and germans

alexander solzhenitsyn who was expelled from the 
soviet union after he chronicled the horrors of josef stalins 
rule was asked to join an officially sanctioned committee building 
a monument to stalins victims 
an organizer said today the move did not necessarily indicate an 
easing in official attitudes toward the dissident writer whose 
works angered the kremlin but reflected the number of soviet 
citizens who think solzhenitsyn is one of the best qualified people 
to serve on the committee 
solzhenitsyn who won the 1970 nobel prize in literature wrote 
the gulag archipelago which traces the history of political 
repression in the soviet union especially the purges and 
repression during stalins 29year reign 
solzhenitsyn who himself spent eight years in labor camps under 
stalin was expelled from the soviet union in 1974 following the 
publication of the gulag trilogy in the west he now lives in 
vermont 
under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev stalin and his legacy 
have received increasingly severe criticism in july the ruling 
communist party politburo approved the building of a monument in 
moscow to stalins victims 
on aug 25 a public council to supervise the construction and 
maintenance of the monument was formed as well as an executive 
committee to submit a blueprint for the memorials design 
among those selected for the public council were solzhenitsyn 
fellow dissident and nobel peace laureate andrei d sakharov poet 
yevgeny yevtushenko and boris yeltsin the fiery former moscow 
party boss 
yuri samadunov a member of the executive committee said 
members of the public council had been chosen in street polls 
conducted at two central moscow locations as well as from names 
submitted by readers to literaturnaya gazeta ogonyok and other 
staterun publications 
we chose the first 17 people mentioned and solzhenitsyn was 
among them samadunov said in a telephone interview 
this weeks edition of moscow news listed solzhenitsyn as a 
member of the public council charged with building the memorial 
however samadunov said the committee had not yet been able to 
notify solzhenitsyn that he had been selected for the committee or 
to determine whether he would agree to take part in its work 
we sent him a telegram with news of his selection and that of 
the others and asked his agreement but the telegram was returned 
to us with a notice that it could not be delivered because the 
address was not precise enough said samadunov 
solzhenitsyns wife has previously denied that the writer 
intends to visit the soviet union 
in june the editor of the literary monthly novy mir said he was 
negotiating for the right to print solzhenitsyns novel cancer 
ward which would mark the first publication of the authors work 
in his native land since he was expelled in 1974

a billiondollar drug ring gunned down 
the mother of a potential witness hatched terroristlike plots to 
free their jailed kingpin and laundered profits through phony coal 
companies prosecutors allege 
us attorney jim wilson on thursday announced the indictment of 
25 alleged members of the ring on conspiracy racketeering and 
obstruction charges eighteen were in custody thursday the others 
remained at large 
the ring described as one of the biggest in the southeast 
smuggled 33 tons of cocaine worth 16 billion into the united 
states over five years wilson said 
jerry allen lequire the alleged ringleader has been in prison 
since before his conviction in a 1983 smuggling operation involving 
about 710 pounds of highgrade colombian cocaine 
bill warner a drug enforcement administration agent said that 
case launched the probe that resulted in the indictment unsealed 
this week 
cocaine was brought from colombia into small or remote airports 
in alabama georgia and tennessee and hauled to florida kentucky 
and tennessee for sale authorities said 
wilson said the ring set up several phony coal companies in 
kentucky and one in north carolina to launder its profits which 
helped finance a lavish life of yachts and jaguars for some members 
members of the ring committed crimes ranging from the 
machinegun slaying of a witness mother to witness tampering and 
attempting to record grand jury proceedings prosecutors said 
in one of the alleged escape plots hatched to free lequire from 
prison lequire in 1985 came up with a scheme to blow up power 
lines airports dams and naval vessels to convince authorities 
that terrorists were active in the united states according to the 
indictment which gave no further explanation 
the organization had profits totaling more than 280 million in 
the year beginning july 1982 alone and the same amount of cash was 
buried in vaults on a farm in greenback tenn wilson said 
this is probably one of the biggest importation operations 
in the southeastern united states said fbi agent gerald shockley 
the indictment unsealed tuesday in knoxville tenn and 
announced here thursday named lequire as the leader of a gang that 
wilson said smuggled 33 tons of cocaine one ton of marijuana and 
1200 methaqualone tablets into the southeast from 1981 to 1986 
ira dement an attorney who along with defense lawyer f lee 
bailey is representing lequire had no comment on the indictment

a woman who posed either as a sex 
surrogate or someone bored with sex on three tv talk shows says a 
sex therapist asked her to play the part but the therapist 
says he didnt intend to deceive anyone 
dean c dauw a chicago clinical psychologist licensed sex 
therapist and author defended himself during an appearance via 
satellite thursday on the sally jessy raphael show which is 
taped here 
i never intended to perpetrate a ruse i never said go 
pretend dauw said 
appearing in person was tani freiwald 37 a former office 
manager for dauw who earlier this year posed as either a sex 
surrogate or a woman bored with sex on talk shows hosted by 
raphael oprah winfrey and geraldo rivera 
wes bailey 33 also of chicago who pretended on one show to be 
a virgin and on another to be an impotent husband also was 
interviewed via satellite he and ms freiwald have worked together 
in community theater 
raphael said she decided to do the program with the three to be 
broadcast sept 8 to give the public a chance to question people 
who had blatantly lied 
dauw said he had given ms freiwald some training in sexual 
surrogacy and i thought her to be functioning as a surrogate 
i assumed perhaps falsely she was working with my other 
therapist he said 
ms freiwald said she had done some research into sex surrogacy 
but decided it was not for her and she charged that dauw has asked 
her do you think you can play the part 
you asked me to dress provocatively for these parts you asked 
me to look like i was a sexy girl she said 
dauw said he may also have falsely assumed that bailey a friend 
of ms freiwalds was working with his other therapist we were 
acting in good faith said dauw it is very easy to have 
unclear communications or miscommunications 
ms freiwald said she had decided to play the part of a sex 
surrogate on raphaels show because it was an improvisational 
challenge i didnt think i could pass up and an opportunity to 
see how one of her favorite talk shows is produced 
ms freiwald said the deception had an educational value in that 
it showed you have to be a critical analytical participatory 
watcher of television 
bailey said he agreed to take part in the trickery because i 
felt it was like going whitewater rafting or climbing a mountain

a burglar dubbed by authorities the human fly is 
apparently scaling highrise buildings and entering apartments 
through open balcony doors police said 
the burglar has made nearly 50 nighttime hits in southeast 
denver during the last six months 
hes got to be athletic either a mountain climber or someone 
skilled said sgt bill wiederspan we think hes got to have 
some climbing equipment 
earlier this week in one night six apartments in a 10story 
building were burglarized police said the apartments were on the 
third sixth eight ninth and 10th floors and were entered through 
balcony doors 
police said the fly may want thrills as much as money his 
highflying antics have cost his victims an average of only about 
50 and his takes have ranged from 20 to 500 police said 
the fly has left some clues an occasional shoe print on a 
balcony railing or a screen door removed from its track 
originally we hesitated to believe the victims wiederspan 
said we thought it might have been an internal theft you get a 
burglary on the eighth floor of a building you hesitate to believe 
someone is capable of doing it 
but as more reports came in police theorized he scales the 
sides of buildings and may occasionally exit through a hallway 
door police said

irans commander in chief today said 
iraqs claim to the disputed waterway at the southern end of their 
border was an attempt to rekindle the war the official islamic 
republic news agency reported 
in a prayer sermon at tehran university hashemi rafsanjani 
attacked iraqs demand that the waterway known as the 
shattalarab in iraq and as the arvand river in iran be dredged 
and cleared of wreckage 
rafsanjani also parliament speaker said iraq started the war 
with the prime goal of gaining control of the arvand river and 
was trying to rekindle it by repeating its aborted claim on the 
waterway the irna report said 
iran wants a 1975 treaty that split the waterway down the middle 
to remain in effect but iraq claims the agreement is void 
in baghdad the governmentrun daily aththawra said it expected 
peace negotiations to be difficult exactly like the difficulty 
of war 
the newspaper said the iranian government had nullified the 
treaty by declaring in 1980 that all agreements signed by shah 
mohammed reza pahlavi were invalid the shah was overthrown by an 
islamic revolution in 1979 
with regard to the negotiations the most important thing is 
to realize that this is our chance to get all our rights on land 
at sea and in the air the newspaper said 
in tehran rafsanjani said soldiers at the front must remain 
vigilant because there is a chance the war could start again 
even if the possibility of war becomes only 10 percent or 20 
percent we must remain attentive 
rafsanjanis remarks also were broadcast by tehran radio both 
reports were monitored in nicosia 
we want our armed forces to respect and obey the ceasefire 
but in case the enemy does not they irans forces have a right 
to respond said rafsanjani echoing remarks he made in a 
television interview thursday 
both sides have made repeated belligerent statements over the 
past few days as unsponsored peace talks in geneva sputtered 
over troop withdrawals and control of the waterway 
the foreign ministers of iran and iraq have not met for a week 
although talks have continued at a lower level negotiations 
started aug 25 
in geneva iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati charged 
today that iraq has violated the gulf war ceasefire more than 60 
times since it took effect two weeks ago and he said iraq was 
blocking progress in the peace talks by raising new 
preconditions every day 
un observers have not reported any serious ceasefire 
violations only minor problems that they said were resolved

iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati today 
charged that iraq has violated the ceasefire in the persian gulf 
war more than 60 times since it took effect two weeks ago 
velayati also said iraq was raising new conditions every day to 
block progress in peace talks aimed at ending the eightyear 
conflict 
in tehran irans commander in chief accused iraq of trying to 
rekindle the war by claiming the disputed shattalarab waterway 
the official islamic republic news agency reported the commander 
hashemi rafsanjani made the remarks during a prayer sermon today 
at tehran university 
velayati spoke to reporters as he left the un building after 
meeting with jan eliasson a swedish diplomat who is the new un 
special representative for the talks shortly afterward iraqi 
foreign minister tariq aziz also met eliasson to brief him on 
iraqs position at the talks 
iraq is prepared to continue working sincerely and seriously 
toward full agreement on implementing the un ceasefire 
resolution that forms the basis of the negotiations aziz told 
reporters 
he did not comment on velayatis allegations 
both sides have traded charges of ceasefire violations but 
un observers monitoring the truce did not report any serious 
violations by either side only minor problems that were 
resolved 
after the establishment of the ceasefire iraq has had more 
than 60 kinds of violations of the terms of the ceasefire 
velayati said we have some difficulties because daybyday they 
raise some new preconditions 
the two 90minute meetings were eliassons first talks with 
velayati and aziz on substantial issues eliasson was formally 
introduced to them by un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar after eliassons appointment thursday 
the two ministers have not met facetoface since aug 26 when 
the talks stalled negotiations have continued at a lower 
technical level since 
perez de cuellar who had mediated the talks since they began 
aug 25 left geneva on thursday because of other commitments he 
said he was frustrated by the slow pace of the talks but that he 
was trying to end the stalemate he said he would return to geneva 
if necessary 
the talks are stalled over followup procedures to the 
ceasefire that went into effect aug 20 
the major problem is the shattalarab waterway which forms the 
southern border between the two nations and is iraqs only outlet 
to the sea 
iraq wants full control of the waterway and has repudiated a 
1975 treaty that gave iran control of half of the shattalarab 
iran says any peace settlement must include strict adherence to 
that treaty 
a un compromise would guarantee free navigation for both 
nations in the persian gulf withdrawal to internationally 
recognized borders and an impartial study of conflicting positions 
on the shattalarab 
the ceasefire resolution also calls for prisoner exchange and 
the work of a commission to determine which side started the war 
on thursday iran accused iraq of taking more than 750 iranian 
troops prisoner in attacks since the ceasefire began the iraqi 
government said iran continued setting up observation posts and 
bunkers moving troops close to the border and launching gunboats 
into the shattalarab 
a un report thursday said iran brainwashed iraqi prisoners of 
war turning many into fanatical supporters of iran the report 
also said many pows from both nations are afraid to return home 
the report was compiled by maj gen rene bats of the belgian 
army and international law professors wolfram karl of the 
university of salzburg austria and torkel opsahl of the 
university of oslo norway 
pow camps in iran were dominated by iraqi prisoners who swore 
allegiance to irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and denounced 
iraqs president saddam hussein as an atheist the report said 
cultural committees in the camps provided religious and 
political instruction called spiritual guidance it said to 
us it is indistinguishable from mental pressure 
in iraq the report found no mental indoctrination of iranian 
pows but said the prisoners also were worried about going home 
the un investigators estimated that iran may be holding up to 
70000 pows and iraq may have about 35000 prisoners

an extremely cautious delta air 
lines pilot aborted takeoff when a panel indicator warned of 
possible engine trouble on flight 1141 on which a jet crashed and 
burned a day earlier 
six people aboard aborted flight 1141 thursday were among the 95 
survivors of wednesdays crash at dallasfort worth international 
airport which killed 13 the doomed plane also was a boeing 727 
he was only at a maximum of 20 knots 23 mph which is 
pretty slow for an airplane said glenda johnson a delta 
spokeswoman in atlanta then he gets an indicator on the panel 
that there is a momentary disruption of air flow in one of the 
engines 
the captain feels that he had what is called a compressor 
stall said another delta spokesman bill berry there was a 
crosswind blowing across the runway that can interrupt the 
smoothness of the airflow that goes into the engine creating a 
temporary loss of power 
under normal circumstances a pilot would simply increase 
thrust to see if everything continued to perform right but based 
on the incident that happened yesterday the captain was extremely 
cautious and elected simply to come back to the gate and let 
maintenance look at the engine berry said 
on any day berry said captains have got to go by their years 
of experience and can abort flights if they dont like what 
they feel if theyve just got a gut feeling 
delta declined to release the pilots name 
today delta flight 1141 departed dallasfort worth without 
incident the flight was airborne at 849 am a few minutes 
behind schedule 
delta officials at the terminal declined to talk to reporters 
but several passengers who regularly take flight 1141 said the 
plane carried only about half as many passengers as usual 
wednesdays flight 1141 bound for salt lake city crashed and 
burned shortly after takeoff federal investigators said the 
aircraft may have experienced an engine malfunction as it left the 
runway 
delta officials said no maintenance problems were found in the 
engine of the jetliner whose takeoff was aborted although 
officials said there never was any danger many passengers appeared 
jolted after the plane returned to the gate 
we figured this would be the safest flight we could ever take 
today said louise cox of baton rouge la as she waited to 
board another 727 for salt lake city evidently not 
it was a routine takeoff until we got almost to the end of the 
runway said assistant us attorney don burkhalter of jackson 
miss where the flight originated then we heard what sounded 
like bumps and the pilot decelerated he said there was a problem 
with the compressors burkhalter said 
the captain said and this is a quote its just one of those 
things we just laughed 
it was a nervous laughter said burkhalter who was on his way 
to fresno calif with his wife 
thursdays flight carried 102 passengers and a crew of seven 
said delta spokesman henry conley in dallas conley said that to 
his knowledge all the passengers got on a substitute plane 
a survivor from wednesdays crash said he had trouble working up 
the courage to board flight 1141 the flight that was aborted a 
day after the accident 
youve got to do it sometime said ronald black 30 of west 
monroe la cant live in dallas 
burkhalter said two of the crash survivors aboard thursdays 
flight whom he talked to appeared relatively calm although one 
said he was a little nervous 
passenger george snelling 30 of dallas said he missed 
wednesdays flight 1141 because of a faulty alarm clock 
waiting to board the same flight thursday snelling said im 
a little apprehensive but when the times up its up and i would 
have been on the plane yesterday

windhoek southwest africa ap the southwest africa 
peoples organization today denied it planted a bomb at a hotel 
patronized by blacks and blamed south africa the blast killed two 
people and injured 15 police said 
the threestory continental hotel was severely damaged by the 
explosion thursday evening witnesses said parked cars were hurled 
across the street 
about one mile away a mine exploded 90 minutes later on a 
railroad line but no one was injured police said hospital 
officials earlier had said two people were hurt in the blast 
the southwest africa peoples organization or swapo has 
fought since 1966 for independence for the south africaruled 
territory 
it issued the denial from its office in lusaka zambia and 
called the bombing one of south africas dirty tricks the 
statement said it is not swapos policy to attack soft targets 
this bomb attack was aimed at demoralizing white namibians and 
setting them against swapo 
the explosions occurred on the day swapo said it would begin a 
voluntary ceasefire the organization has fought a long guerrilla 
war against south african control of southwest africa also known 
as namibia 
the governmentrun broadcasting network said an anonymous 
telephone caller claimed responsibility on behalf of the 
guerrillas and south africas chief representative in the 
territory louis pienaar blamed the bombing on swapo 
the guerrilla group normally attacks military targets or white 
residential or shopping areas but the hotel was patronized by 
blacks pienaar did not explain why the guerrillas would bomb a 
hotel patronized by blacks 
firefighters needed more than 90 minutes to bring the blaze 
under control 
swapo and other black groups have warned of a possible white 
backlash in southwest africa because of preliminary south african 
proposals for independence elections that probably would result in 
government by the black majority 
swapo said its guerrillas would stop launching attacks in the 
territory thursday to contribute to a regional peace initiative 
involving south africa cuba and angola 
south africa has administered southwest africa for 73 years 
despite repeated un resolutions since 1966 calling for 
independence in the territory 
south africa says it will begin withdrawing from southwest 
africa on nov 1 and allow independence elections june 1 1989 if 
cuba pulls its 50000 troops out of angola by june 1 
on tuesday south africa said it has pulled all its troops out 
of angola where it was fighting alongside rebels in their battle 
against angolas marxist government and its cuban allies

investigators are pointing to possible 
problems with delta flight 1141s engine thrust and wing flaps 
before it crashed on takeoff and hope to get answers from the crew 
and the cockpit recordings 
national transportation safety board investigators said thursday 
a flap indicator handle in the wrecked cockpit was found in the 
wrong position for most takeoffs raising questions whether the 
planes wing flaps were set properly 
incorrectly set flaps led to the fatal crash of a northwest 
airlines flight last summer the delta air lines flights indicator 
handle however could have been accidently jarred during or after 
the crash investigators said 
the boeing 727 got no more than 30 feet off the runway at 
dallasfort worth international airport before it crashed 
wednesday witnesses told the ntsb thirteen people were killed 
pilots in planes waiting on adjacent taxiways told investigators 
a white flame or vapor came from the left engine said ntsb 
member lee dickinson 
a cockpit tape recording recovered from the burned wreckage 
revealed that the pilots talked about engine trouble seconds before 
the crash he said 
further review of the tape and the flight data recorder were 
planned today at the ntsbs washington laboratory 
the jetliner crashed as it tried to take off for salt lake city 
with 108 people aboard ninetyfive people survived the crash most 
by escaping through emergency exits or tornopen areas of the 
fuselage thirtythree remained hospitalized thursday 
medical examiners said the 13 died from smoke inhalation many 
were trapped when an emergency door wouldnt open 
the planes flight engineer steven m judd told investigators 
that right after the plane took off the crew began experiencing 
problems keeping the plane stable and in the air the new york 
times reported today 
just before the crash there was some talk of engine 
problems judd added according to the times which attributed 
judds statement wednesday to an anonymous source 
judd and the two other members of the cockpit crew remained 
hospitalized today investigators said they had not recovered 
sufficiently to undergo fullscale debriefings but that they hoped 
to interview first officer wilson kirkland today 
control tower personnel said the jet may have taken longer than 
usual to become airborne and that it may have lifted off at a 
sharper angle than is considered normal the investigators said 
obviously one of the questions that we will be trying to get 
an answer to is why the airplne did not lift off the runway until 
about 8500 to 9000 feet down the runway it was too long a 
distance for a runway takeoff said dickinson noting the plane 
should have begun to take off between 5500 feet and 6000 feet 
dickinson said investigators also received maintenance records 
on the plane thursday 
the flap handle on the console between the pilot and the first 
officer indicates whether the flaps are in the proper position to 
provide the lift needed for takeoff dickinson said the handle was 
found in the up position opposite where it should be for most 
takeoffs 
but he said the handle could have been pushed into the wrong 
position by the impact or during the evacuation of the crew 
it could have been kicked it could have been moved it could 
have been any number of things dickinson said 
flight crews of nearby planes told investigators they had no 
clear indication of the flap or slat positions he said 
federal investigators determined that the flaps and slats of a 
northwest airlines md80 were not properly set for takeoff when 
that plane crashed aug 16 1987 at detroit metropolitan airport 
killing 156 people 
earlier dickinson told reporters the crew was warned of trouble 
by the stick shaker which rattles the jets steering mechanism 
when a problem develops 
this indicates the plane may be approaching a point where it 
wont be able to fly he said shortly after that there was 
some conversation about an engine problem 
but he stressed that the warning could have stemmed from

announcement at news conference today in california where his is 
campaigning the sources said 
sasso will appear at a separate news conference at noon in 
boston along with his replacement as campaign manager susan 
estrich and campaign chairman paul brountas 
the move to rehire sasso comes at a time when dukakis has been 
criticied for allowing his once doubledigit lead in the polls to 
disappear in the wake of aggressive attacks from republican nominee

said sasso was among those urging dukakis to take a more aggressive 
stance hes the man the governor believes in most will listen 
to the most said one of the sources

then served as his statehouse chief of staff will take a leave 
from his job at hill amp holladay an advertising firm he joined last

by telephone reluctant to appear together with his former top 
aide the vice chairmans job will be a paid campaign position the 
sources said

responsible for leaking videotapes to the press showing that biden 
used words during a debate in iowa taken almost verbatim from a 
campaign speech by british labor party leader neil kinnock 
biden dropped out of the campaign after this and other instances 
of alleged plagiarism were publicized another dukakis campaign 
aide paul tully also resigned because of his role in the incident 
dukakis at first reluctant to accept sassos resignation said 
later that sasso had used very poor judgment 
dukakis also said sasso will have no role in this campaign 
but he refused to rule out a possible role for sasso in a dukakis 
administration should he win in november

legislators today completed a l9month 
process of drafting a new constitution to replace an authoritarian 
document handed down two decades ago by the military regime 
the document shortens presidential terms to five years 
abolishes cencorship guarantees the right of workers to strike and 
rejects land reform 
elated lawmakers in the constituent assembly sang the national 
anthem and threw confetti into the air when speaker ulysses 
guimaraes closed the final sesion at 149 am 
brazil is a new country guimaraes said this constitution 
will protect the weak and punish those who abuse power 
the final version appeared to be a mixture of radical even 
nationalistic laws on foreign and domestic business and mainly 
conservative laws on issues such as land reform 
since february 1987 legislators have been working on the new 
charter which replaces the 19yearold constitution handed down by 
military generals during a 19641985 military regime 
the new 245article charter is to go into effect sept 23 it 
will be brazils eighth constitution in 166 years of independence 
the 559 representatives and senators chosen in wideranging 1986 
elections have been voting for several weeks on the more than 1000 
amendments to the 245article final draft which was completed in 
july 
the draft itself was the result of more than a year of voting on 
an initial draft of more than 3000 articles derided by many 
because of its length 
over the past 19 months legislators engaged in heated and often 
even violent debate over such controversial issues as land reform 
the system of government brazil should adopt the presidential term 
and the right to strike 
some of the key decisions are 
president jose sarney and future presidents will serve for five 
years in contrast to the sixyear term of former military 
presidents 
censorship a remnant of military days was abolished in films 
books and television 
the right to strike was guaranteed for all workers before 
essential sectors of the labor force were not allowed to strike 
the assembly rejected wideranging land reform in a country 
where four percent of the people own 50 percent of the farmable 
land this countered a government promise to distribute land to 14 
million landless peasant farmers 
decree law a powerful tool used by the president to bypass 
congress and push through legislation was also abolished 
the voting age was lowered from 18 to 16 years of age the only 
other country where 16 year olds can vote is nicaragua 
maternity leave for new mothers was extended from 90 to 120 
days and the work week was cut from 48 to 44 hours 
a 12 percent ceiling was imposed on interest rates charged 
above inflation interest rates have been running as high 1000 
percent yearly while inflation this year is expected to reach 700 
percent 
mineral mining was nationalized and foreign companies now 
involved in mining will have to leave brazil in four years or 
transfer financial control to residents of the country

the soviets are expanding naval facilities in 
the syrian port of tartus and the neighboring island of arwad to 
counter the us presence in the mediterranean israeli analysts 
said today 
the soviet unions installations in tartus include submarine and 
surface ship maintenance facilities and constitute the largest 
soviet naval base in the mediterranean said dore gold of tel aviv 
universitys jaffee center for strategic studies 
according to aharon levran editor of the middle east military 
balance published this week by the center the facilities extend to 
arwad island and include recreation facilities for soviet crews 
gold said there was no declassified information available on the 
current or planned size of the soviet base but said the general 
trend has been one of expansion at least since 1987 
in addition the soviets use land installations in syria for 
naval and air intelligencegathering the two analysts said in 
separate interviews with the associated press 
gold said that the main objective of the tartus base expansion 
was to counter the presence of the us 6th fleet in the 
mediterranean 
the soviets had to find new arrangements in the region after 
albania shifted its alliance to china in 1961 and egypt abrogated 
its friendship treaty with moscow in 1976 he said 
he said the tartus facility was important for prolonged 
deployment of soviet attack submarines in the mediterranean 
in an article published today in the englishlanguage daily 
jerusalem post gold noted that the londonbased janes defense 
weekly in may referred to tartus as the primary maintenance 
facility for soviet submarines operating in the mediterranean 
levran said the soviets have been using tartus for at least five 
years and that the bases expansion apparently was a price syria 
had to pay for purchasing soviet weapons 
in spite of the kremlins recent reluctance to supply syria with 
advanced weapons systems he said syria is still the soviet 
unions strategic asset in the middle east 
he said the base replaced the soviet practice of using 
mediterranean squadrons motherships for maintenance but he said 
the base was less important than the recently developed soviet far 
eastern base in cam ranh bay vietnam 
syrias navy levran wrote in the 198788 middle east military 
balance underwent a radical facelift due to supplies training 
and maintenance cooperation from the soviet union 
the soviet base in tartus could create a problem for israel 
in wartime because israel may be reluctant to harm a sovietflagged 
facility he said

recommendation has not yet been made to air force secretary edward 
aldridge said academy spokesman will ketterson

funds they carried signs reading usaf academy discriminates 
disabled and ready to serve and be all you can except 
disabled 
sen william l armstrong rcolo also has asked the air force

iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati today 
said iran will do its best to help win the release of the british 
hostages in lebanon 
velayati also told the british broadcasting corp radio he had 
asked friendly groups in lebanon to help free the british 
hostages and received an affirmative reply he spoke to the bbc in 
geneva where he is participating in peace talks in the iraniraq 
war 
in beirut the weekly magazine ashshiraa reported that anglican 
church envoy terry waite one of the british hostages is suffering 
from a severe stomach ailment it said that could speed his release 
the weekly quoted unidentified highly informed sources as 
saying waites health had sharply deteriorated recently which 
forced his kidnappers to call in a stomach specialist to treat 
him 
the same sources said the sudden deterioration of waites 
health could result in speeding up his release ashshiraa said 
the magazine gained fame when it broke the story of the secret 
us arms sales to iran but since then its report about hostages 
held by proiranian extremists in lebanon have not all been 
accurate 
there was no way to verify the report on waite 
many of the 18 foreigners missing in beirut are believed to be 
held by proiranian extremist groups 
in addition to waite the british hostages are teacher brian 
keenan 36 who also holds irish citizenship and journalist john 
mccarthy 31 
the british foreign office says it also seeks word on alec 
collett a new yorkbased british journalist whose palestinian 
abductors claim they killed him his body was never found 
velayati said the matter is not in the hand of our 
government but when asked if iran would help to get the britons 
out of lebanon he said we will do our best he also said he 
had been informed unofficially and informally of good news but 
he did not elaborate 
the longestheld hostage is one of nine missing americans 
associated press chief middle east correspondent terry anderson 
who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
waite 48 disappeared jan 20 1987 after leaving a west beirut 
hotel for a rendezvous with islamic jihad an underground 
proiranian shiite moslem group that holds two american hostages

michael dukakis saying i want the 
strongest team i possibly can announced today that john sasso 
who resigned under fire a year ago was returning to the democratic 
presidential campaign as vice chairman 
almost a year ago john sasso made a very serious mistake 
dukakis told a news conference hes paid the price 
sasso resigned as campaign manager last sept 30 after it was 
disclosed he was responsible for putting together and leaking a 
videotape demonstrating that a rival democratic candidate sen 
joseph biden jr of delaware was using without attribution the 
campaign rhetoric of british labor party leader neil kinnock 
the questioned passage came from a kinnock speech in which he 
described his personal background biden incorporated kinnocks 
words to describe his own background 
sasso resigned the day after dukakis had told a news conference 
that no one in his campaign was involved in leaking the videotape 
dukakis said he told biden he wanted to bring sasso back into 
the campaign and the senator could not have been more gracious 
dukakis denied that sassos return was linked to his decline in 
public opinion polls in his race against republican nominee george 
bush 
i want the strongest team i possibly can he said noting 
that labor day next monday is the traditional start of the 
stretch drive of the presidential campaign 
dukakis described sasso as a uniquely talented individual who 
can provide real strength 
asked if he thought sassos return would blunt democratic 
charges of ethical violations by members of the reagan 
administration dukakis replied that there was nothing illegal 
about what john did 
as new vice chairman of the dukakis campaign sasso will 
undertake unspecified duties which the candidate said were 
undetermined 
he said susan estrich would remain as campaign manager and paul 
brountas would continue as campaign chairman 
dukakis announcement came as he wound up a west coast campaign 
swing stressing his interest in education and accusing the reagan 
administration of trying to scuttle school programs 
the massachusetts governors backers said the battle for 
californias crucial 47 electoral votes was dead even 
dukakis said thursday that bush had undergone an electionyar 
conversion on the subject of education 
dukakis was planning to continue that emphasis during 
appearances today in portland ore and spokane wash as schools 
open 
dukakis said the voters this fall would face a choice between 
two very different ideas of prosperity and two very different 
records of leadership 
he said it was a choice between those who see education as a 
lifetime commitment and those who see it as an election year 
strategy 
during the speech to teachers and school officials in oakland 
dukakis said the reagan administration had eliminated remedial math 
and reading programs for 500000 poor children had cut teacher 
retraining and led an assault on college loans and grants 
by contrast he said that in massachusetts he had quadrupled 
scholarship assistance to low and middleincome students and 
invested in professional development centers to help teachers 
update their skills 
the reagan administration unsuccessfully sought cuts in the 
remedial programs in 1981 in an april 1988 report the education 
department said the number of children in remedial programs had 
dropped from 5 million in 197980 to 45 million in the 198586 
school year 
while theyve invested billions in star wars weve developed 
a regional network of star schools dukakis said 
and where was george when all this was going on dukakis 
said echoing a theme from the democratic convention last july 
where was the man who now says he wants to be the education 
president 
he was playing hooky he was nowhere to be found 
meanwhile anthony podesta who is running the dukakis campaign 
in california said he now has 70 fulltime employees a number he 
said would grow to 500 by midoctober 
were going to run a field organization beyond the 
imagination podesta said well have a precinct captain in 
every precinct in the state 29000 of them 
podesta called the race between dukakis and bush dead even 
in california an assessment also given by state democratic 
assemblyman tom hayden 
hayden said california voters want change and that while 
dukakis promises change hes also not a wild man 
dukakis is the most acceptable democratic candidate weve had 
in a very long time statewide he said 
i dont think bush conveys an image of change hayden said 
hes been in office hes the vice president hes the 
establishment 
at the same time hayden said dukakis must reassure california 
voters hes for stable defense spending because of the large 
number of defenserelated companies in the state

pavarotti stayed off the stage movies 
stopped in midreel concert halls were hushed and radio programs 
fell silent 
cultural life in sweden came to a halt for three minutes at 815 
pm thursday when actors musicians dancers and even librarians 
protested what they called the low level of government support 
artists in most countries might be envious of the swedes 
stockholm capital of a country of 84 million people has as many 
theaters as london artists can get state grants but they say it 
isnt enough to live on 
statesupported theaters have launched the careers of director 
ingmar bergman and actors such as ingrid bergman max von sydow and 
ingrid tulin 
the nation which awards the nobel prize for literature sells 25 
million theater tickets a year nearly one for every third person 
in an article published friday actress bibi andersson protested 
that the cultural assistance were too low projects were too 
vulnerable to cuts and grants were too snagged in bureaucratic 
tangles 
why do actors have to get swallowed up in bureaucracy why do 
fiery spirits grow tired she wrote in the aftonbladet daily 
what we wanted was to make culture an election issue she 
said referring to the sept 18 national elections its a 
question of priorities 
the strike was a success for the artists they got a lot of 
attention and managed to get their message across said martin 
lindbloom spokesman of the ministry of education and culture 
in the west coast city of goteborg touring opera tenor luciano 
pavarotti delayed the start of his performance by three minutes in 
support of the strike his audience stood in silence during that 
time 
one channel of the staterun television broke into its regular 
program for live reports showing movie theaters with darkened 
screens silent stages and a candlelight vigil in goteborg by 400 
people two radio channels were quiet while the third played simon 
and garfunkels sounds of silence 
at stockholms national dramatic theater the staging of eugene 
oneills long days journey into night gave the protest a 
unique twist 
at precisely 815 pm the young artist edmund delivered his 
line im broke action froze on stage for three minutes then 
edmunds father resumed the play with the reply youre always 
broke and you always will be 
official figures cited by lindbloom say national support for the 
arts is nearly as high in sweden as in france and more than 
anywhere else in europe 
direct yearly support amounts to 400 million and municipal 
subsidies to local cutural establishment is about 937 million 
lindbloom said 
together with indirect help such as building new museums or 
libraries sweden spends about 15 percent of its gross national 
product on the arts he told the associated press 
although nothing has been trimmed from the national budget 
local authorities slash cultural projects first whenever they run 
into trouble complained ingmar bjorksten the cultural affairs 
correspondent for svenska dagbladet 
unemployment among artists is five times the national average of 
just under 2 percent bjorksten wrote 
the only way for culture to get more money is to make a 
fuss said svante weyner head of radio swedens cultural 
division last year the radio cut the budget for a popular program 
of radio plays the budget was restored only after ingmar bergman 
intervened

the nearly 9monthold 
rebellion against israel has inspired new parents among the 
palestinians to give their babies such names as uprising 
revolution victory struggle and sacrifice 
an official at al ittihad hospital in nablus one of the west 
banks largest hospitals said that of 247 births in the last two 
weeks in july 20 infants were given names connected with the 
uprising 
he cited freedom and liberation as other new names being given 
palestinian children noting liberation had been used for both boys 
and girls 
but the official who asked not to be identified said some 
parents were hestitant for fear the names would not be allowed when 
they went to register births with israeli authorities 
atef hajouj of bani naim in the occupied west bank said he ran 
into trouble when he named his daughter intifadeh the arabic 
word for uprising he said officials at the interior ministry told 
him the name was illegal 
they told me to change her name or i will be fined hajouj 
24 said in an interview one intifadeh is enough they said 
hajoujs wife yussrah insists the name is perfect for the 
child now 5 months old its very simple she was born in the 
victorious intifadeh and she deserves to be named intifadeh mrs 
hajouj said 
interior ministry spokeswoman tova elinson said israel has no 
policy of preventing palestinians from naming their children 
whatever they wish 
everyone is allowed to register newborns no matter what his 
name ms elinson said some names may not be recorded when

thousands of dead fish were found floating on 
the jordan river possibly poisoned by fishermen on the sea of 
galilee looking for an easy catch an official said friday 
we suspect largescale poisoning using agricultural 
pesticides said elad zohar an area supervisor 
zohar said the pesticides apparently were dumped in the sea of 
galilee and killed more fish than the fishermen could catch 
thousands of the poisoned fish then floated from the fresh water 
lake into the narrow winding jordan river he said 
the bible says the sea of galilee is where jesus performed his 
miracle of the fish and loaves feeding 5000 people from five 
barley loaves of bread and two fish it also is where he walked on 
water to dispel doubts among his disciples 
the damage caused by the poisoning is very great zohar told 
the associated press for every fish caught three others are 
rotting and washing ashore 
in addition those caught still carry the poison in their 
systems israel radio broadcast a warning saying fresh water fish 
should not be eaten 
zohar blamed the poisoning on marginal elements among the 
sea of galilees 180 commercial fishermen and said it wasnt the 
first time it had happened 
poisoning usually takes place during low periods when fish are 
hard to catch zohar said it also happens when fishermen dont 
feel like going out and working 
zohar said thousands of fish died primarily carp and st 
peters named after the fisherman who became an apostle of jesus 
alma avni a senior health ministry official said the mass 
poisoning may be related to the upcoming month of holy days 
including the jewish new year and yom kippur during which fish is 
a popular staple 
she said poisoned fish eaten in small quantities would not harm 
humans because it took much less poison to kill a fish than a human 
but she cautioned fisheaters to make certain the fish they 
buy comes with a certificate showing where the fish were caught and 
who caught them

a fiery george bush stepped up his 
attack on opponent michael dukakis environmental record today 
accusing him of trying to pollute the new jersey waters where 
sewage has washed up on the beach this summer 
the republican presidential nominee spoke on a sunny beach that 
in the past has been closed because of medical waste and sewage 
washing ashore 
bush referred to the 1985 request from dukakis as governor of 
massachusetts to dump his states sewage off the new jersey coast 
at a site used by new jersey and new york 
bush told a few hundred supporters in beach attire that the next 
time dukakis visits the state they should be sure to ask him why 
did you want to dump boston sludge off our coast in new jersey 
why did you pledge a clean ocean to the people of new jersey when 
your own state applied to pollute it 
speaking on thursday in norwalk conn of what he called the 
natural heritage that we all have to do something about bush 
called himself a teddy roosevelt republican on the environment 
roosevelt was an avid conservationist responsible for setting aside 
millions of acres of forests and launching irrigation and 
reclamation projects 
aware that republicans and the reagan administration in 
particular are a target of unrelenting criticism by environmental 
groups bush declared nonetheless were not going to give this 
constituency away to the democrats 
he recalled his acceptance speech at the republican convention 
last month when he said he wanted to make the united states a 
gentler nation 
this is part of what i mean a nation in which all of us treat 
the environment with greater reverence and greater respect he 
said 
today bush was continuing his effort to pull votes from the 
environmentallyminded with speeches to residents of belmar beach 
and later in new castle del 
bush sought to embarrass dukakis on a day when the boston herald 
headlined a new poll that put him neckandneck with the governor 
in massachusetts 
fantastic bush said when reporters showed him the newspaper 
i cant believe it he said in massachusetts 
the herald survey found dukakis and bush tied in the state at 42 
percent each the poll of 400 likely voters conducted wednesday had 
a 5point margin of error 
a poll for the herald in july found dukakis leading by 14 
percentage points 
in his boston harbor tour bush laid the fault on dukakis for 
failing to clean up the harbor which has become a major 
embarrassment to the state with half a billion gallons of raw 
sewage being dumped in daily construction of new wastewater 
treatment facilities is now beginning under federal court order 
he said dukakis had been intent on delay to do anything but 
clean up the sewage and sludge and twice sought federal waivers 
of the clean air act requirement for secondary treatment of sewage 
i dont call that leadership and i certainly dont call that 
competence he said in reference to dukakis statement that 
voters should look for competence in this presidential race 
in his first term as governor dukakis prepared a waiver request 
to the federal government but it actually was filed by his 
successor gov ed king in 1979 
dukakis filed the second waiver request in 1984 in 1985 the 
environmental protection agency sued the state to force a cleanup 
bush also criticized dukakis for promising to end the dumping 
that has left medical waste cluttering new jersey beaches when 
dukakis himself as governor asked for federal permission to dump 
waste off new jersey 
the stealth candidate is at it again making promises on one 
hand but hiding his secret record on the other bush said 
the 1985 massachusetts request to the epa was for temporary 
permission to dump 106 miles offshore where new york and new jersey 
were already dumping a compromise arrangement allowed 
massachusetts to dump further out beyond the continental shelf 
standing on a boston ferry boat off of deer island the future 
site of a new sewage treatment plant near the harbor mouth bush 
called for a ban on ocean dumping of sewage sludge after 1991 and 
for greater coast guard efforts and fbi participation in catching 
violators

an advertising executive who succeeded in getting 
his russian wife and 1yearold son out of the soviet union was 
convicted today of assaulting them nine days after they arrived in 
canada 
kirby inwood was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm on 
his wife and of common assault on the boy assault carries a 
maximum sentence of 10 years in canada but offenders are often 
sentenced to six months or less 
provincial court judge gordon hachborn rendered his verdict 
following a sensational trial that involved tales of sex greed and 
violence 
inwood 44 of toronto maintained throughout the trial that his 
wife tanya sidorova was a money hungry russian yuppie who 
lured him into marriage to get out of the soviet union he said she 
fabricated a story of the assault as a way to end their marriage 
ms sidorova 32 told of a vicious beating in which she was 
punched kicked choked and thrown barely conscious from her 
toronto home she said her son misha was also assaulted by a 
drunken inwood 
hachborn said he felt ms sidorova was exaggerating but he said 
he had concluded that inwood was fabricating his evidence i came 
to believe that the more i heard him testify 
hachborn said there was an aura of unreality about what the 
accused said occurred between him and his wife 
the trial attracted daily headlines and drew crowds to the 
courtroom 
at one point womens groups picketed the courthouse alleging 
battered women couldnt get a fair shake in the justice system 
inwood testified he and ms sidorova slept together the day they 
met in leningrad in 1986 but he questioned whether misha was his 
child testifying he was often impotent 
the couple married soon after christmas 1986 and misha was born 
in september 1987 but the soviet government refused to let ms 
sidorova emigrate to canada claiming she was a security risk 
that began a yearlong campaign by inwood during which he spent 
thousands of dollars lobbying government officials in both 
countries and pleaded in the press for her release 
when moscow relented inwood said he was deliriously happy 
i felt like the white knight rescuing the fairy princess he 
said at his trial but the fairy tale turned into a horror story 
inwood said ms sidorova changed as soon as she arrived in 
canada he said she criticized his home and an emerald ring he gave 
her and pressured him to buy her a corvette and a fur coat 
ms sidorova painted a picture of inwood as an abusive violent 
man who threatened to kill her and misha 
on the night inwood was arrested she testified he beat me 
like a wild animal like a beast 
sentencing arguments were being held following announcement of 
the verdict

the federal trade commission should order 
toyota to directly notify owners of secret warranties on cars made 
by the japanese company the center for auto safety said in a 
petition filed friday 
the toyota documents clearly show that the company has an 
internal policy that systematically reimburses consumers for 
failure of specific components beyond the written warranty said 
sam cole of the center a consumers group often critical of the 
automakers and their regulators 
certainly every toyota owner should be made aware of 
the policy he said 
an internal toyota document published last month by the detroit 
news listed 41 components for which toyota motor sales usa could 
be reimbursed by its japanese parent company 
the document said an attachment was a complete secret 
warranty listing 
after the document was published toyota said the listing 
referred to reimbusement beyond the normal warranties under the 
companys customer satisfaction policy rather than to secret 
warranties 
the center a year ago asked the ftc to require all manufacturers 
to disclose secret warranties

democrat michael dukakis trying to regain momentum for his 
presidential campaign said today he was rehiring former campaign 
aide john sasso because i want the strongest team i possibly 
can for the battle against republican nominee george bush 
bush meanwhile appeared before vacationers on the sands of 
belmar beach nj to press his attack on dukakis environmental 
record as massachusetts governor 
dukakis he said fought to allow boston sludge to be dumped 
off new jerseys shore the very shore on which he had the nerve 
to stand and promise clean water bush added sarcastically 
nice guy 
dukakis winding up a campaign swing through the west coast 
announced in san jose calif that he was bringing back the former 
campaign manager who had resigned last sept 30 after sasso 
admitted helping torpedo the campaign of party rival joseph biden 
of delaware 
dukakis said sasso who will be vice chairman of his campaign 
was a uniquely talented individual who can provide real 
strength 
the governor denied that sassos return was linked to dukakis 
recent decline in public opinion polls in his race against bush 
a dukakis campaign source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said dukakis plans to announce that former campaign manager john 
sasso will return to the campaign as vice chairman 
sasso had previously engineered dukakiss successful campaign to 
recapture the massachusetts governorship after a term out of 
office and directed dukakiss presidential campaign until he 
resigned in september 1987 
sasso left after admitting that he circulated a videotape 
demonstrating biden had borrowed without attribution some deeply 
personal remarks by british politician neil kinnock only two days 
earlier dukakis said he had been assured no one on his campaign 
staff was the source of the video tape 
dukakis and bush took advantage of the timely concerns the 
opening of school and a summer haunted by the specter of 
wastestrewn shorelines to go after voters before the official 
labor day opening of the campaign season 
while theyve invested billions in star wars weve developed 
a regional network of star schools dukakis said thursday in 
california while contrasting his achievements as massachusetts 
governor with the inaction of the reagan administration 
where was the man who now says he wants to be the education 
president dukakis said in oakland he was playing hooky he 
was nowhere to be found 
he charged the reagan administration has eliminated remedial 
math and reading programs for 500000 poor children cut teacher 
retraining and led an assault on college loans and grants 
he said that in massachusetts he had quadrupled scholarship 
assistance to low and middleincome students and invested in 
professional development centers to help teachers update their 
skills 
the reagan administration sought cuts in the remedial programs 
in 1981 but was unsuccessful in an april 1988 report the 
education department said the number of children in remedial 
programs had dropped from 5 million in 197980 to 45 million in 
the 198586 school year 
dukakis was planning to continue that emphasis during 
appearances today in portland ore and spokane wash as he 
courts the reagan democrats democrats who voted republican in the 
1980 and 1984 presidential elections 
bush after a rally thursday into dukakis backyard where he 
charged the governor failed to act swiftly against pollution in 
boston harbor continued his campaign as a lifelong 
environmentalist on the delaware and new jersey shores dukakis 
called bushs newfound commitment an electionyear conversion 
bush also criticized dukakis for promising to end the dumping 
that has left medical waste cluttering new jersey beaches when 
dukakis himself as governor asked for federal permission to dump 
waste off new jersey 
the stealth candidate is at it again making promises on one 
hand but hiding his secret record on the other bush said 
the 1985 massachusetts request to the epa was for temporary 
permission to dump 106 miles offshore where new york and new jersey 
were dumping already a compromise arrangement allowed

forests and launching irrigation and reclamation projects 
aware that republicans and the reagan administration in 
particular are a target of unrelenting criticism by environmental 
groups bush declared nonetheless were not going to give this 
constituency away to the democrats 
bushs incursion in massachusetts was more than physical a 
boston herald poll released published thursday showed he and 
dukakis to be neck and neck in massachusetts fantastic bush 
said when given the news 
dukakis meanwhile was reported today to be resurrecting his 
fallen campaign manager john sasso who resigned last year after 
it was revealed that he provided videotapes to the news media 
showing sen joseph biden ddel 
 
 
the herald survey found dukakis and bush tied in the state at 42 
percent each the poll of 400 likely voters conducted wednesday had 
a five percentage point margin of error a poll for the herald in 
july found dukakis leading by 14 percentage points 
dukakis spokesman dayton duncan countered were very 
confident michael dukakis will carry massachusetts were also 
confident he will carry george bushs other home states maine 
texas washington dc and any others he claims 
jesse jackson in atlanta for a meeting to plan voter 
registration strategy tried to put an end to reports that tension 
was rising between his supporters and the dukakis camp 
i would hate to wake up on the morning of nov 9 the day 
after the election and hate to think that we lost by the lack of 
my work he said promising to campaign for the ticket and the 
party in general 
republican vice presidential nominee sen dan quayle of 
indiana continued his southern swing today after touring a watch 
plant in little rock ark and watching a high school football 
practice in jackson miss 
quayle was asked at one point about a forthcoming article in the 
new republic which said a public relations firm run by quayles 
campaign manager stuart spencer was paid 350000 in 198485 to 
lobby for panamanian ruler gen manuel antonio noriega 
advance copies of the article say the firm lobbied against drug 
investigations of noriega and defended him against allegations of 
killing former president dr hugo spadafora in september 1985 
quayle said he did not know about the specifics of the story 
from my observation stuart spencer is a political pro

the soviets are expanding naval facilities in 
the syrian port of tartus and the neighboring island of arwad to 
counter the us presence in the mediterranean israeli analysts 
said friday 
soviet installations in tartus including submarine and surface 
ship maintenance facilities constitute the largest soviet naval 
base in the mediterranean said dore gold of tel aviv universitys 
jaffee center for strategic studies 
aharon levran editor of the middle east military balance 
published this week by the center said the facilities extend to 
arwad island and include recreation facilities for soviet crews 
gold said no declassified information was available on the 
current or planned size of the soviet base but that the general 
and continuing trend has been expansion since 1987 
he said the soviet navys mediterranean squadron is using 
tartus about 200 miles north of tel aviv because it is outside 
soviet territory and has good access to the mediterranean 
the soviets use other land installations in syria for 
intelligencegathering gold and levran said in separate interviews 
gold said the main objective of the tartus base expansion was to 
counter the us 6th fleet presence in the mediterranean 
the united states has bases in spain italy greece and france 
the soviet union had to find new arrangements after albania shifted 
its alliance to china in 1961 and egypt dropped its friendship 
treaty with moscow in 1976 he said 
gold said the tartus facility was important for prolonged 
deployment of soviet attack submarines in the mediterranean 
the londonbased janes defense weekly in may called tartus 
the primary maintenance facility for soviet submarines operating 
in the mediterranean 
levran said the soviets have been using tartus for at least five 
years and that the bases expansion apparently was a price syria 
had to pay for purchasing soviet weapons 
despite the kremlins recent reluctance to supply syria with 
advanced weapons systems he said syria is still the soviet 
unions strategic asset in the middle east 
he said the base replaced the soviet practice of using 
mediterranean squadron ships for maintenance but he said the base 
was less important than the recently developed soviet far eastern 
base in cam ranh bay vietnam

saturdays election in singapore will pass the 
torch of leadership to a younger generation but the man who has 
led this prosperous asian citystate since 1959 is not expected to 
retire 
the governing peoples action party is expected to win the 
parliamentary election by a big margin prime minister lee kuan 
yew who will be 65 on sept 16 is expected to step down in favor 
of first deputy prime minister goh chok tong 46 
lee who called the election truly a watershed has been 
prime minister since 1959 and more than half of the 26 million 
people have known no other leader 
he is to remain secretarygeneral of the pap and although he 
has expressed disinterest is still regarded as the most logical 
candidate to be the countrys first elected president 
those who believe that when i have left the government as 
prime minister that i have gone into permanent retirement really 
should have their heads examined lee said recently 
the proposed elected presidency remained the key issue as the 
nineday campaign wound down friday it would replace the current 
appointed ceremonial post with a president holding veto power over 
spending the nations ample financial reserves and nominations to 
senior civil service and judicial positions 
even the most optimistic of opposition leaders do not expect to 
be able to muster enough votes to form a government 
the singapore democratic party under chaim see tong the only 
opposition member when the last parliament was dissolved would 
settle for denying the pap the twothirds majority needed to amend 
the constitution save democracy now deny them twothirds is 
the slogan for the partys 18 candidates 
the biggest opposition challenge was posed by the workers 
party which fielded 32 candidates but secretarygeneral jb 
jeyaretnam who won election with chaim at the last polls in 1984 
was disqualified from parliament for five years from 1986 for 
falsifying party accounts 
the pap won 77 of the 79 seats in 1984 but was shocked by a 126 
percent drop in total popular vote to 629 percent the opposition 
gain was attributed to several issues including a proposal to bar 
the withdrawal of savings from the central provident fund a 
mandatory social securitylike program at age 55 
senior party officials now make regular walkabouts to press 
the flesh and sample public opinion controversial proposals such 
as the elected presidency are no longer rammed through parliament 
on the strength of a twothirds majority 
the party has tried to lure voters by promising welfare 
recipients more money and recommending wage increases after two 
years of official restraint caused by recession 
parents were told they may use central provident fund savings to 
finance college educations for their children the national day 
celebrations this month were made extra festive with a 
governmentsanctioned street party that attracted 250000 revelers 
more good years is the pap slogan the party takes credit 
for a booming economy that generated 112 percent growth in 
inflationadjusted terms in the first half of the year 
singaporeans enjoy one of the highest living standards in asia 
and 86 percent of them live in apartments built by a government 
that is is generally perceived to be efficient and relatively free 
of corruption 
the recently enlarged unicameral parliament now has 81 seats 
and the legislators serve fiveyear terms the pap already has 11 
seats where it was running unopposed 
the pap needs to win at least 30 more seats to get a simple 
majority of 41 to form a new government and run the country for the 
eighth consecutive term since 1959 
it faces 141 candidates from seven opposition parties and four 
independents opposition candidates numbered only 51 in the last 
election 
there are 42 traditional singlemember voting districts but for 
the first time each party competing in 13 constituencies had to 
nominate three candidates at least one of them from a minority 
group voters select a team of three and each gets a separate vote 
in parliament 
singapores 2 million people are 76 percent ethnic chinese 
about 15 percent malay and six percent indians 
voting is compulsory for the 15 million eligible voters in the 
70 contested districts voting hours saturday are from 8 am to 8

sen dan quayle attacked democratic 
nominee michael dukakis on friday as flat wrong on defense and 
foreign policy issues and promised that republican candidate 
george bush will be the american farmers friend 
quayle who is bushs vice presidential running mate told an 
alabama audience that farmers should not have to compete against 
illegal subsidies that lower the prices of goods produced 
overseas 
as long as we can get that level playing field the american 
farmer will outproduce and be more competitive than any farmers in 
the world quayle said 
if the bushquayle ticket is elected in november he said 
were going to put the state department on the side of the farmer 
instead being on the side of the trading partners 
in a blast at dukakis quayle said the republican and democratic 
candidates disagree most sharply in their approach to national 
defense 
we believe in a strong national defense to deter aggression 
against america and he does not quayle said 
on matters of national defense and foreign policy believe me 
our opponent is not even half right hes just flat wrong quayle

seattles worstever power outage will keep many 
downtown businesses and apartment houses in the dark into the labor 
day weekend officials said 
utility officials thursday said replacement of thousands of feet 
of firedamaged cable was taking more time than expected 
julia greenlee a city light spokeswoman said the expected time 
for restoring electricity to the 40block area had been pushed back 
from tonight or saturday morning to saturday afternoon or evening 
maybe we were being too optimistic in our original estimate 
ms greenlee said 
a smoky fire of undetermined origin wrecked an underground vault 
containing two transformers and switching equipment wednesday 
cutting electricity to much of the citys retail financial and 
hotel core and closing numerous businesses 
many restaurants that tried to stay open with limited service 
were closed by health inspectors concerned about food spoilage and 
potential sanitation problems 
i probably closed 15 to 20 places myself said janet 
anderberg senior environmental health specialist with the 
seattleking county health department we had places that were 
cooking with candles and washing their hands without hot water 
no serious injuries have been reported nor were there any 
reports of looting as police increased patrols in the area 
at stewart house residents pooled the contents of defrosting 
refrigerators and held a barbecue in the courtyard for lowincome 
elderly and disabled residents 
generators were provided by city light for five hotels with a 
large share of elderly residents 
about 70 city light workers labored through the night thursday 
ms greenlee said 
authorities have refused to estimate the number of affected 
businesses workers and residents dozens of whom have been 
relocated until power is restored 
isabel boldrin 87 said she walked down 23 flights from her 
place in a 26story condominium to wash at a department store just 
outside the outage area 
the power failure left her without elevator service and 
residents of the upper 22 floors also were without water she said 
the almost complete blackout of banks in the area could leave 
many residents who rely on government checks short of cash over the 
labor day weekend 
i talked to a lot of people today who were down to counting 
their dimes and quarters said the rev carol ludden and you 
cant go out to eat on dimes and quarters

hundreds of thousands of burmese 
demonstrated for immediate democracy friday and dissident leaders 
called for more protests rejecting president maung maungs pledge 
of a referendum on oneparty rule 
a western diplomat said he had reports that students buddhist 
monks and others had taken over about 40 town governments because 
of continued strikes demonstrations and defections of officials 
in moulmein the mon state capital 50 miles east of rangoon a 
resident said the government had been paralyzed since early august 
by strikes of city employees 
the report said an 11member committee formed by the states 
buddhist monk organization was running the city and citizen patrols 
handled security 
more than 10000 striking government employees in moulmein 
rallied friday against maung maungs referendum plan denouncing it 
as an attempt to prolong the 26year rule of the burma socialist 
program party 
about 300000 people including striking government workers and 
policemen held a rally for democracy in monywa and rejected the 
presidents plea for a return to work a resident said the city is 
400 miles northwest of rangoon 
maung maung expressed sympathy with the protesters in a speech 
thursday but said he must respect constitutional procedures and 
cannot bow to demands for an interim government 
he said the party leadership would meet sept 12 to consider 
holding a referendum on oneparty rule that could lead to a 
multiparty system 
protesters from all segments of society blame the party which a 
military coup brought to power in 1962 for brutal repression and 
for rigid socialist policies that have visited economic ruin on a 
nation rich in natural resources 
the western diplomat said of the reaction to maung maungs 
speech they think its not enough they cannot trust the 
government to carry out its promise 
he said protesters were calling for largescale demonstrations 
sept 8 but strikes and protests already are daily events and it 
was not clear what more could be done 
former defense minister tin oo a leading dissident said 
friday it is no longer necessary to hold a referendum the whole 
country has rejected oneparty rule only an interim government 
will be able to reactivate the stalled administration and ease the 
situation 
similar responses came from the new league for democracy and 
peace made up by elder statesmen and military officers led by 
former president win maung and the rangoon lawyers council a 
governmentsponsored group 
a statement by the lawyers said the shooting of demonstrators 
and indefinite detention of suspects last month violated the 
constitution 
it is ridiculous to talk about constitutionality by the 
government that has violated the constitution on various 
occasions the statement said the national sentiment against 
oneparty rule is evident by demonstrations throughout the nation 
maung maung said thursday the government would legalize student 
unions banned since 1962 and rebuild the rangoon university 
student union building which the army destroyed in suppressing 
dissent that year 
about 3000 students rejecting that marched through rangoons 
streets in the green dresslike school uniforms called longyis 
among them were children of kindergarten age 
with thousands of other marchers including government workers 
the young burmese shouted the students cause and the peoples 
cause are indivisible 
a 17yearold student leader called maung maungs speech a 
cunning trick to divide students from the people and declared 
we will continue to demonstrate until the oneparty regime is 
replaced by a democratic regime 
fridays rallies in rangoon were peaceful and far fewer people 
participated than the estimated 100000 who turned out the day 
before 
a western diplomat in thailand said he believes former ruler ne 
win will flee burma on thursday a senior officer of the foreign 
trade bank in rangoon said members of his entourage had tried to 
transfer 18 million kyats 3 million to london but the bank 
refused 
ne win led the 1962 military coup and after 26 years of rule 
resigned july 23 taking indirect responsibility for studentled 
riots in march and june 
sein lwin a hardline former general succeded him and protests 
followed at least 112 people were killed in rangoon alone by 
official count but unofficial reports put the toll much higher 
after 17 days sein lwin resigned and was replaced by maung 
maung the first civilian leader since 1962

scrawling your john hancock across the back of a 
paycheck may not be enough to get it cashed anymore no matter how 
large your bank account or how well you know your teller 
a new federal law guaranteeing customers faster access to their 
deposits includes littleknown uniform standards for endorsing 
checks 
under the regulations which took effect thursday all 
endorsements must be within a 1inch section along the edge of the 
back of the check so they dont interfere with endorsements from 
the bank at which the check is deposited 
only appropriate color ink such as blue and black may be 
used by banks for their endorsements according to the regulations 
administered by the federal reserve board 
financial institutions say they have been training employees and 
mailing out brochures with diagrams to educate customers on the new 
standards 
robert hutchinson a senior vice president from manufacturers 
hanover trust in new york said there have been few problems so far 
im unaware of any excessive long lines he said but 
lets be honest theres going to be an adjustment period its 
going to take time for everyone to understand and adjust to the 
rules 
some bank employees said privately they were bracing for a few 
initial headaches 
incorrect customer endorsements they said could delay check 
clearing and might affect subsequent transactions based on money 
derived from that check 
it wont be the banks problem its the customers problem 
but well be hearing about it said one branch manager of a large 
new yorkbased bank 
stores also have had to adjust to the new guidelines many 
businesses routinely stamp the backs of checks with a lengthy list 
of identification items store clerks must obtain from customers 
as a result stores have had to buy new rubber stamps or 
reprogram cash registers to print within the smaller endorsement 
area 
the fed has defended the new requirements as necessary to speed 
checkclearing so that bounced checks can be returned quickly to 
the institution where they were cashed 
the new rules require financial institutions to give customers 
access to deposited funds within one three or seven days 
depending on the type of check 
consumer groups had complained that too many banks were holding 
funds for periods as long as two or three weeks before making the 
money available to the depositor a practice that cost americans 
millions of dollars in interest

the ateam fought its last battle on 
television years ago but won another one in court in a copyright 
suit by the writer of an unsuccessful tv pilot about another crew 
of vietnam vets 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals on thursday upheld a 
judges ruling that nbc had not copied the actionadventure series 
from a screenplay called cargo by ernest olson 
olsons script involved three vietnam veterans who had conducted 
scams during the war and were looking to continue them in civilian 
life over the opposition of their former superior officers who had 
become corrupt drug agents 
the ateam involved the adventures of four vietnam vets 
three of whom were unjustly courtmartialed in vietnam escaped 
from prison and were on the run its stars included mr t and 
george peppard 
a federal jury in los angeles found that the series was 
substantially similar to cargo and that nbc had access to 
olsons work before putting on the ateam but the judge 
overruled the jury finding no substantial similarity 
in a 30 decision the appeals court said the two works were 
actionadventure series designed to show vietnam veterans in a 
favorable light and there was some resemblance between the leading 
characters but the court said the similarities fell far short of 
the evidence needed for copyright infringement 
the court noted also that olson had defined the characters in 
cargo with descriptions of only a few lines each

no group immediately claimed responsibility for any of the 
attacks 
more than 100 bombings have been reported in south africa under

of the attacks on the outlawed african national congress the main 
black group fighting to overthrow the whitedominated government

mine exploded later alongside a railroad track near the city in the 
south africanruled territory no injuries were reported in the 
railroad bombing officials earlier had said two people were 
injured 
south africas chief representative in the territory louis 
pienaar blamed the hotel bombing on proindependence guerrillas of 
the southwest african peoples organization but swapo which 
began observing a voluntary ceasefire thursday denied the 
allegation and blamed it on south africas dirty tactics

attacks signal an escalation of retaliatory attacks by

a leading antiapartheid member 
of parliament brought books chocolates and fruit on friday to 
jailed black leader nelson mandela at the clinic where he is 
recovering from tuberculosis 
the activist lawmaker helen suzman has met with the african 
national congress leader several times during his 26 years in 
prison after the visit she described mandela as very 
optimistic very moderate and easygoing 
we did not talk in depth on politics and we did not discuss 
his possible release she said 
she added however i remain as over many years convinced 
that mr mandela is a reasonable man and that he will play a 
valuable part in any negotiation proceedings 
mandela 70 was transferred wednesday from a state hospital to 
the constantiaberg clinic a new and relatively luxurious private 
hospital in a cape town suburb mandela was moved aug 12 from 
pollsmoor prison to tygerberg where doctors said he made a good 
recovery following drainage of fluid from his lungs 
mandela the countrys bestknown black leader is serving a 
life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the whiteled 
government 
mrs suzman met with mandela for about an hour she took him 
fruit chocolates and a book by the late south african writer alan 
paton during the visit she made a quick trip to a shop to buy 
candied fruit that mandela requested 
she said the visit was her first with mandela in more than two 
years and came about because of persistent requests to justice 
minister kobie coetsee following mandelas hospitalization 
coetsee met with mandela on thursday and said the prisoners 
health had improved considerably 
a progovernment newspaper the citizen friday quoted 
unidentified government sources as saying the move to the clinic 
was a goodwill gesture which officials hoped would prompt a 
conciliatory response from mandela and make his release possible 
mandelas lawyer ismail ayob has said he does not view the 
transfer as an indication the government has decided to free 
mandela 
government officials had suggested previously that mandela would 
be moved to a clinic and possibly allowed an increased flow of 
visitors before a final decision was made whether to release him 
outright thus far prison officials have not eased mandelas 
visiting priveliges 
mandelas full recuperation is likely to take a few months 
after that period the government could choose whether to send him 
back to prison or grant him freedom 
president pw botha said two weeks ago he was seriously 
considering releasing mandela but indicated he wanted mandela to 
renounce violence 
mrs suzman 71 entered parliament in 1953 and is its 
longestserving member between 1961 and 1974 she was the only 
parliament member for the antiapartheid progressive federal party

a blood center has been criticized by federal 
officials for distributing 22 units of blood before completely 
ensuring that they were not infected by the virus that causes aids 
the centers director says 
federal drug administration officials inspected the belle 
bonfils memorial blood center in july and said the center failed to 
follow standard procedures by releasing blood that initially tested 
positive for aids and hepatitis said center director dr robert 
chapman bonfils supplies blood to regional hospitals 
the blood which went to about 45 people later tested negative 
when new chemicals were used in followup tests said chapman 
blood center officials also retested all but two of the donors 
of the blood and all had negative test results for aids and 
hepatitis said chapman 
he said transfusion recipients were not contacted because 
officials are confident they were not infected 
chapman said the 22 blood units tested positive for the usually 
fatal aids virus and hepatitis during one week in june 
ordinarily we see maybe three to five test positive he said 
when any unit of blood tests positive the center performs two 
additional tests said chapman if both followup tests are 
negative the blood is released if one is positive additional 
tests are done and the blood may be discarded said chapman 
the 22 units of blood in question did not pass both tests the 
day after the initial tests read positive for aids and hepatitis 
but chapman said laboratory technicians believed the tests were 
defective and they released the blood 
this was a really unusual number and the lab felt something 
was wrong with the test chemicals the doctor said new 
chemicals were used the following week and on retesting all those 
units were negative for the diseases 
clearly this shows the tests were faulty said chapman 
but ordinarily we would not use a unit when there is any 
question its not the safest thing to do 
the center has instituted a policy requiring supervisors to 
approve all units of blood that test positive for aids said 
chapman he said lab technicians had made those decisions 
previously

two brothers in the irish 
republican army killed with a third man in a british army ambush 
were buried at their home village friday in a peaceful ceremony 
watched by 500 riot police 
before dawn police in belfast fired plastic bullets to disperse 
rioters during a third night of violence in roman catholic areas 
no injuries were reported 
the rev peter taggart the roman catholic priest who conducted 
the funeral mass spoke of disturbing questions about british 
tactics in killing gerard and martin harte aged 29 and 21 and 
brian mullin 26 
police with riot shields and clubs swamped the tiny village 45 
miles west of belfast and flanked the cortege route making the 
country lane so narrow some mourners could barely squeeze through 
police said the hartes and mullin were wellknown ira men who 
were armed and dressed for a violent mission when bullets riddled 
their car tuesday press reports said they were on their way to 
kill an offduty soldier 
mullin who was martin hartes brotherinlaw will be buried 
saturday in nearby dunmoyle 
ira supporters say the men could have been given a chance to 
surrender the government of the irish republic although it also 
has outlawed the ira expressed concern and the killings were 
discussed at a cabinet meeting friday 
taggart told the congregation in st marys church the sanctity 
of human life is binding on everyone not just an ordinary 
citizen but also on the government and those charged with the 
administration of the law 
some disturbing questions have been raised about the 
circumstances in which these young men died he said it is 
necessary to point out that the law of the land must obey the moral 
law 
authorities in the protestantdominated province appeared 
determined to prevent the ira from making the funeral a show of 
antibritish strength no incidents were reported and no guerrilla 
paraphernalia was evident apart from a beret and pair of gloves on 
each coffin 
an ira statement distributed to news media said it had honored 
the slain comrades thursday night by firing a volley in the 
loughmacrory area 
black flags flew from all the telephone poles in the village and 
ira the voice of an oppressed people was daubed on a wall 
a military helicopter hovered low as the coffins draped in 
irish flags reached the graveyard its clatter nearly drowned the 
eulogy delivered by gerry adams president of the iras legal 
political wing sinn fein 
police say gerard harte commanded the midtyrone ira unit and 
martin harte was responsible for choosing targets among police and 
members of the locally recruited ulster defense regiment 
the ira is fighting to drive the british from northern ireland 
and unite it with the irish republic which is 95 percent catholic 
it acknowledged the three men as members and said they died on 
active service by which it means during an operation but has 
given no details of the mission 
so far this year the ira has lost 11 members and has killed 27 
british soldiers including eight with a bomb that blew up their 
bus aug 20 not far from loughmacrory 
britain responded to the increased attacks by saying new 
measures would be taken and the ambush was seen as the beginning 
of a crackdown 
military officials also have adopted tighter security 
organizers of sport aid a worldwide charity run scheduled for 
sept 11 said the army withdrawn from an event in londons hyde 
park and the defense ministry explained in the current security 
climate regretfully the army cannot participate 
six british soldiers were killed june 15 by a bomb planted in 
their van while they participated in a charity run in northern

in the bombing and standoff she could have received up to 50 years

be filed tuesday

a west german freighter carrying 2100 tons of toxic 
wastes will unload its cargo in italy government officials said 
friday 
the ship the karin b was denied permission to dock in spain 
britain france west germany the netherlands and belgium the 
wastes originally were shipped from italy and dumped illegally in 
nigeria 
environment minister giorgio ruffolo and civil defense minister 
vito lattanzio said after a cabinet meeting that the wastes 
probably will be unloaded at an unspecified italian military port 
the ship is anchored in international waters off the coast of 
france 
the wastes may have come from as many as 10 european countries 
but they were shipped from italy nigerias military government 
seized an italian ship the piave last july to bolster its demand 
that italy remove the wastes 
the karin b was the first of two ships sent to pick up the 
wastes it sailed from nigeria on july 30 the second ship the 
deep sea carrier sailed from nigeria on aug 15 and reportedly is 
steaming off the coast of portugal 
the cabinet announcement did not mention the second ship 
officials have said they dont know the precise chemical content 
of the cargo but on wednesday robert smeraldi a spokesman for 
the environmental group friends of the earth said its lab 
technicians in nigeria found the drums contained pcbs and were 
highly flammable 
pcbs or polycholorinated biphenyls can cause cancer and burns 
on contact 
the plight of the karin b is similar to that of the zanoobia 
the syrian freighter that was italys first socalled ship of 
poison 
it wandered the mediterranean for four months with a cargo that 
had once been dumped illegally in venezuela that ship was finally 
given permission in june to unload its 12000 drums of industrial 
waste in genoa

the first big radio telescope array 
in the southern hemisphere began operating friday opening a new 
window on the littleexplored southern sky 
well be looking at the center of our galaxy because it passes 
right above our head in the southern hemisphere said dr ron 
ekers the director of the instrument named the australia 
telescope much of the galaxy and the nearest neighboring galaxy 
the magellanic cloud is not visible to observatories in the 
northern hemisphere 
ekers who for seven years was director of the 27dish very 
large array radio telescope in western new mexico said the 
telescope will study black holes and pulsars 
the new 40 million instrument located on the windswept plains 
of western new south wales consists of five new 726foot dishes 
mounted on 186 miles of railroad track 
an identical dish on a track 186 miles away will make the array 
equivalent to one dish with a diameter 372 miles 
when linked to the exisiting 211footdish at parkes 241 miles 
to the south and others spread across the continent the australia 
telescope can be extended like a zoom lens on a camera to the 
equivalent of a dish 2400 miles in diameter 
the commonwealth scientific and industrial organization the 
government funded research institution that designed the 
telescope said the compact array of seven telescopes had an 
equivalent resolution to being able to read a telephone directory 
at a distance of 660 feet 
when linked to telescopes in space it would be 10000 times 
greater 
the australia telescope is the state of the art in 
astronomical technology it is one of the best telescopes in the 
world prime minister bob hawke told an audience of astronomers 
and scientists at the inaugural ceremony 
harry van der laan head of the european southern observatory in 
chile said if australia hadnt built it the european southern 
observatory would have had to do it in chile 
we have the biggest optical telescopes in the southern 
hemisphere at la silla in chile but we had no major radio 
telescope array world astronomy cannot do without it he said 
this fills that gap and it puts australia back in the top 
league of astronomy its the equivalent of winning the americas 
cup in yachting van der laan said

unemployment climbed to 56 percent in august 
as the number of jobless americans grew by 226000 and a fourmonth 
hiring boom in the nations factories ended abruptly the 
government said friday 
stock and bond prices soared on the news and analysts said the 
softening job market was just the cold shower than an 
overheating economy needed they predicted it will keep a lid on 
inflation and interest rates through the november elections 
the 02 percentage point rise from julys unemployment rate of 
54 percent was characterized by 5000 layoffs in a manufacturing 
sector that had put 130000 more workers on their assembly lines in 
the previous three months in response to surging foreign demand for 
us exports 
last month when factories reported adding 70000 workers in 
july despite a slight increase in joblessness from a 14yearlow 
53 percent in june the federal reserve board applied the brakes 
to the economy raising interest rates onehalf percentage point 
this is a case where bad news is good news for an economy that 
was running hellbent toward overheating and creating a very 
worrisome inflationary environment allen sinai of the boston 
co a new york economic consulting firm said of the august jobs 
report a little cold shower here was exactly what was needed 
richard rahn the us chamber of commerces chief economist and 
a frequent critic of the federal reserves monetary policies said 
the unemployment figures show that the board has achieved its 
goal of slowing the economy 
they now should reduce interest rates to avoid killing the 
expansion he said 
most other analysts said they doubt that will happen but they 
agreed there is now little likelihood that interest rates will be 
raised again before the election 
a separate survey of business payrolls showed employers adding 
219000 new jobs in august compared with average monthly gains of 
more than 325000 the previous three months 
larry chimerine of the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa economic 
consulting firm said the smaller payroll growth is consistent with 
an economy that is still expanding but at a slower pace 
clearly this will delay further tightening by the fed he 
said they wont reverse what they did last month but they can 
now afford to take a waitandsee attitude clearly there is no 
evidence of a wageprice spiral the inflation we are getting is 
limited primarily to commodity prices imports and food and at 
this point does not threat to become much more widespread 
this is another stroke of president reagans luck a 
onemonth cooling down when inflation pressures were building 
rapidly in a too steamy economy sinai said there are two more 
unemployment reports between now and the election but if the rate 
stays between 54 percent and 58 percent it can only be described 
as a major accomplishment 
despite the increase in the unemployment rate the labor 
department said a record 623 percent of the workingage population 
16 and over held jobs in august 
campaigning in new jersey republican presidential nominee 
george bush called the rise in the jobless rate statistically 
almost irrelevant the total work force has been expanding its 
very encouraging he said 
susan estrich campaign manager for democratic nominee michael 
dukakis called the loss of 5000 manufacturing jobs and the 
failure of wages to rise above their 931 hourly average in july 
blows to hopes for prosperity in the nations heartland and 
easing the squeeze on working americans 
wages have risen an average of only 31 percent over the past 12 
months decreasing the buying power of workers by onehalf percent 
after taking inflation into account 
the labor department said most of the 226000 increase in 
joblessness to 6851000 people in august occurred among adult men 
whose unemployment rate rose 04 percentage points to 49 percent 
the unemployment rate also rose among teenagers from 152 
percent to 158 percent but fell from 51 percent to 48 percent 
for women and from 114 percent to 113 percent among blacks 
small employment gains in printing and publishing and 
exportrelated industries such as machinery and electrical 
equipment were more than offset by 9000 job losses in textile and 
apparel plants and smaller declines in several other manufacturing 
industries 
on the services side of the economy large monthly increases in 
retail trade hiring 80000 in july alone slowed to just 23000 
new jobs last month virtually all of them in grocery stores 
other recent highgrowth job areas also slackened business 
services such as temporary help firms added just 16000 new 
workers compared with average monthly increases of 30000 in june 
and july 
new employment in health services which the government predicts 
will be the largest area of job growth in the 1990s as the baby 
boom population ages slowed to 22000 in august from its 
30000amonth average in the past year 
janet l norwood commissioner of labor statistics said one 
encouraging sign was that the number of people working parttime 
because they could not find fulltime jobs returned to the bottom 
of the 52 millionto56 million range within which it has been 
fluctuating for more than a year 
other data in the report however suggested the economy might 
be slowing the average work week declined by 20 minutes to 346 
hours and manufacturing overtime fell by 01 hours to 38 hours a 
week on average 
a separate calculation that includes the 17 million activeduty 
military personnel stationed in the united states showed a jobless 
rate of 55 percent last month up from 54 percent in july

the 9th us circuit court of appeals on thursday upheld a 
judges ruling that nbc had not copied the actionadventure series 
from an olson screenplay called cargo

scams during the war and were looking to continue them in civilian 
life over the opposition of their former superior officers who had 
become corrupt drug agents 
the ateam involved the adventures of four vietnam vets 
three of whom were unjustly courtmartialed in vietnam escaped 
from prison and were on the run its stars included mr t and

olsons work before putting on the ateam but the judge 
overruled the jury finding no substantial similarity 
in a 30 decision the appeals court said the similarities fell 
far short of the evidence needed for copyright infringement

michael dukakis welcomed former top aide john 
sasso back to his presidential campaign friday nearly a year after 
dukakis declared that sasso will not be back because of his 
role in torpedoing sen joseph bidens bid for the democratic 
nomination 
the return of sasso as campaign vice chairman announced jointly 
by dukakis in california and his senior advisers in boston was 
widely seen as another signal that the democratic nominee has 
decided to mount a more aggressive campaign at a time when 
republican george bush has pulled even in most polls 
almost a year ago john sasso made a very serious mistake 
dukakis reporters hes paid the price 
dukakis said he was rehiring his longtime political alterego 
because he wanted to assemble the strongest team i possibly can 
for the final two months of the campaign 
dukakis said sassos return had nothing to do with his recent 
decline in the polls 
its simply the fact were looking at a little more than two 
months of what is going to be a very tough very competitive 
campaign dukakis said its going to be a battle royal for the 
presidency of the united states 
bush chief of staff craig fuller said the rehiring of sasso 
speaks for itself gop vice presidential nominee dan quayle 
campaigning in alabama said it was another sign that the dukakis 
campaign is in serious trouble 
dukakis said sassos involvement in the biden incident should 
not obscure a long and welldeserved reputation for character and 
for integrity 
in boston sasso received a thunderous ovation from dukakis 
campaign and state government loyalists when he walked into a news 
conference with campaign chairman paul brountas and sassos 
replacement as campaign manager susan estrich 
sasso directed dukakis gubernatorial comeback in 1982 served 
as statehouse chief of staff and was architect of the nominees 
presidential campaign he resigned in september 1987 admitting that 
he circulated a videotape showing biden using a british 
politicians rhetoric without attribution 
news accounts about that incident and charges of plagiarism 
forced biden to withdraw from the democratic presidential contest 
at first dukakis denied that his campaign staff was responsible 
for the videotapes but he later acknowledged that sasso was behind 
them sasso and political director paul tully who helped sasso 
prepare the tapes then resigned 
what i did back on september was an error in judgment and i am 
sorry that it hurt sen biden and his family sasso said friday 
sasso and dukakis both spoke to biden earlier friday before his 
return to the campaign was announced aides said dukakis said 
biden could not have been more gracious 
sasso dismissed suggestions that his return would give the bush 
campaign an excuse to accuse dukakis of planning a sleaze 
campaign that would be outrageous of the bush people he said 
they certainly have a problem along those lines 
although he apologized to biden sasso said there was nothing 
unethical or illegal about distributing accurate videotapes 
showing the similarity of speeches by biden and british labor party 
leader neil kinnock 
biden issued a statement saying he was glad sasso had agreed 
that the delaware senator never meant to mislead anyone biden 
said he still supports dukakis for president 
there are contrasts and weaknesses that are issues in this 
campaign said sasso who will take a leave of absence from his 
job with an advertising firm i will not shy away from pointing 
those contrasts out 
that promise drew applause from campaign workers who have 
complained that dukakis and his top aides had not counterattacked 
vigorously enough when bush misprepresented dukakis record 
if nothing else sassos return energized a campaign staff that 
has been sobered in recent weeks by bushs surge in the polls many 
believe that dukakis failure to respond to the republican 
nominees salvos has cost the massachusetts governor the momentum 
and the lead in the polls that he took from the democratic 
national convention 
sasso said spoke to dukakis on tuesday and was asked if he would 
return i said if he thought i could help of course id do it 
sasso said 
now weve got all of our best players on the field said 
dukakis issues adviser thomas herman 
brountas said he estrich and sasso would report directly to 
dukakis and that other campaign staff would continue to report to 
estrich 
campaign aides insisted that the decision to rehire sasso was 
not a sign of dissatisfaction with estrichs performance although 
several said her role in campaign strategy likely would be reduced 
somewhat 
she put the best light on the announcement 
today a family is reunited she said introducing sasso to 
reporters theres nothing more special nothing more satisfying 
than reaching out to family and to me john sasso is family 
brountas said sasso would bring additional strength important 
political insight and wisdom to a very strong campaign team

school officials in a small southwestern 
missouri town need more guidance before they can respond to a 
federal order striking down their ban on schoolsponsored dancing 
according to their attorney 
us district judge russell clark ruled last month that the ban 
on dancing at purdy high school was unconstitutional because it 
promoted the values of those who oppose dancing for religious 
reasons 
the judge said it was not his role to order the district to hold 
dances but he said the district could not enforce a nodance rule 
that some believe to be a century old 
defendants respectfully submit that they do not understand 
what the court is ordering them to do or refrain from doing 
wrote school district attorney ransom ellis iii in a brief filed 
thursday 
but lawyer william fleischaker representing the 21 young people 
and parents who challenged the ban said theres no question in 
my mind about the order 
any efforts by the school district to unreasonably prevent the 
students from having a dance would be in contempt of that order 
fleischaker said 
fleischaker said ellis request for a clarification was 
typical of whats gone on all along here the school district 
has abandoned responsibility they said we cant allow dancing 
because of the rule now theyre saying we dont know what we 
have to do judge you tell us what we have to do theyve run for 
school board let them use some responsibility 
the purdy school system centered in a town of about 900 people 
50 miles southwest of springfield has about 520 pupils 
clark did not address ellis arguments at a hearing friday 
during which the judge considered the amount of attorney fees to be 
awarded the prodance lawyers the judge said he would make his 
final ruling in the case by the end of next week

a former engineers 3 billion lawsuits 
against rocketmaker morton thiokol stemming from his warnings 
against launching the illfated challenger space shuttle mission 
were dismissed friday by a judge 
us district judge david k winders decision came after more 
than six months of deliberations on morton thiokols motions to 
dismiss the suits filed by roger boisjoly 
telephone calls to boisjolys willard residence were answered by 
a recording he did not return messages 
his attorney robert levin said from his office in washington 
dc that a decision had not been made on whether to appeal 
winders ruling to the 10th us circuit court of appeals in denver 
i obviously wish it was better news than we got levin said 
but i havent seen it yet and i obviously cant comment on a 
ruling i havent seen 
morton thiokol officials were elated said company spokesman ed 
snow 
the dismissal of these two suits completely vindicates morton 
thiokol we are very happy to have this situation behind us he 
said 
in one of his suits boisjoly sought 1 billion for the deaths 
of the seven astronauts killed when challenger exploded on jan 28 
1986 and 1 million in compensatory damages for boisjolys own 
health and career 
boisjoly who left morton thiokol in july 1986 citing physical 
ailments and alleged mental torment claimed the aerospace company 
impugned his professional reputation after he and other engineers 
told a presidential commission investigating the disaster that they 
had warned against the launch 
the rogers commission found that a faulty seal in a joint in a 
solid fuel booster rocket made by morton thiokol was to blame for 
the explosion 
boisjoly and several other morton thiokol engineers had argued 
the night before the launch that temperatures of 53 degrees below 
fahrenheit or less could result in failure of the seal 
his other lawsuit filed under the false claims act on behalf of 
us taxpayers sought 2075 billion and alleged that morton 
thiokol knowingly provided nasa with defective rocket motors 
but winder ruled that the conspiracy alleged in the 
complaint is not of a nature to support an action for damages on 
the part of boisjoly neither the conspiracy itself nor the 
overt acts allegedly done in furtherance of it were directed toward 
boisjoly 
boisjoly also alleged that morton thiokols setting aside of his 
recommendation against launching challenger and after the 
accident alleged attempts by the company to discredit him 
threaten his employment and its action removing him from the 
disaster investigation left him severely injured in his 
emotional and mental health 
company lawyers argued that boisjoly who this year won the 
scientific freedom and responsibility award from the american 
association for advancement of science had based his contention 
that he was defamed on office chatter 
but levin accused company officials of launching a deliberate 
campaign to defame boisjoly through pamphlets and interviews not 
coffeeshop stuff 
winder dismissed most counts in boisjolys suits with prejudice 
meaning they cannot be refiled however he said he dismissed two 
counts of boisjolys first civil suit which deal with allegations 
of defamation and conspiracy without prejudice by agreement of 
the parties

rival black political groups 
signed an accord friday to end what has been called the countrys 
worst factional fighting this century in which more than 600 people 
have been killed in 20 months 
an explosion rocked downtown durban just after the evening rush 
hour causing extensive damage to a clothing store and slightly 
injuring a black woman police said 
in other cities a hand grenade was tossed at the home of south 
africas leading mixedrace politician and a bomb exploded in a 
post office no injuries were reported in either attack 
the agreement signed friday sought to halt savage fighting in 
the natal province between supporters of militant antiapartheid 
organizations and members of inkatha a more conservative group 
headed by zulu leader mangosuthu buthelezi 
it was signed at a courthouse in the provincial capital 
pietermaritzburg by inkathas secretarygeneral oscar dhlomo and 
by jay naidoo secretary general of the militant congress of south 
african trade unions 
the labor federation has been allied with the united democratic 
front a nowbanned antiapartheid coalition in the feud against 
inkatha 
the agreement condemns violence and establishes an adjudication 
board to review complaints of harassment or attacks the boards 
members would be selected jointly by the two sides and would have 
disciplinary powers 
each party recognizes the immediate necessity to make it 
abundantly clear to its members that cosatu and inkatha 
categorically condemn acts of intimidation forced recruitment and 
violence the agreement says all political organizations have 
the right to exist and the democratic right to espouse their own 
particular viewpoint 
nicholas haysom a lawyer for the labor federation who helped 
draft the accord said both sides were cautious about their ability 
to convince rankandfile supporters to honor the pact 
the level of retribution and atrocious violence has made 
conditions almost impossible to exercise freedom of association 
he said 
haysom said the adjudication board will be able to judge cases 
far more quickly than the courts can and will seek to gain the 
confidence of witnesses who have been fearful of making statements 
to police 
supreme court justice ns page who had asked the two sides to 
pursue an accord said the courts were not abdicating their 
responsibilities but viewed the new board as a valuable additional 
tool to help stop the bloodshed 
most of the fighting has been in black townships around 
pietermaritzburg although it has spread in recent months to 
townships near the larger port city of durban many of the killings 
have been to avenge earlier killings 
both inkatha which claims 15 million members and the united 
democratic frontlabor federation alliance oppose the apartheid 
policies which enable 5 million whites to dominate 26 million 
blacks but their strategies differ markedly 
the united democratic front a predominantly black coalition of 
some 600 groups advocates economic sanctions strikes and other 
confrontational measures to bring about sweeping political and 
economic change 
inkatha opposes sanctions avoids militant protest and advocates 
capitalism 
many militants view buthelezi as a government collaborator 
because he is chief minister of the kwazulu homeland however 
buthelezi has rejected invitations by the government to join in 
negotiating reforms that would expand blacks political role while 
leaving whites in ultimate control 
peter kerschoff a social worker in pietermaritzburg who has 
been involved in past reconciliation efforts said the agreement 
was not the final step toward peace 
because of government bans and restrictions he said in a 
telephone interview it is extremely difficult for cosatu and the 
udf to communicate with grassroots people this will have to be 
addressed 
the natal violence has distressed antiapartheid campaigners 
elsewhere in south africa and sparked debate over whether black 
political groups could unite effectively to oppose the whiteled 
government 
some commentators viewed the conflict as a harbinger of 
widespread infighting that might develop as black groups with 
different ideologies struggled for supremacy

iran and iraq accused each other friday of 
violating a twoweek ceasefire more than 70 times and a new un 
mediator sought ways to break a deadlock in talks aimed at ending 
their eightyear war 
the foreign ministers of iran and iraq met separately friday 
with swedish diplomat jan eliasson un spokeswoman therese 
gastaut said the talks were intensive but declined to provide 
further details 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar appointed 
eliasson mediator on thursday 
the foreign ministers ali akbar velayati of iran and tariq aziz 
of iraq have not met since aug 26 the second day of the talks 
since then the talks have continued at a lower technical level 
they are to continue on saturday 
the talks have bogged down over followup procedures to the 
ceasefire which took effect aug 20 the problems involve the 
withdrawal of troops and freedom of navigation in the persian gulf 
after meeting with eliasson velayati told reporters that 
after the establishment of the ceasefire iraq has had more than 
60 kinds of violations of the terms of the ceasefire 
the iranian diplomatic mission later released a list of what it 
said were 74 violations of the ceasefire by iraq as of aug 31 
which it said were reported to the un secretary general 
the list included alleged violations on every day of the 
ceasefire except aug 28 and aug 31 it said there were nine 
violations on the first day 
the last entry said that on aug 30 iraqi forces fired an 
artillery shell in the mehran area about 100 miles east of 
baghdad in the central front killing four people 
the official iraqi news agency also said it counted 74 reports 
of ceasefire violations by iran since the ceasefire 
it said the iranians aimed through these violations to 
reorganize some of their military units establishing observation 
posts firing flares and moving personnelladen vehicles 
it repeated previous claims that iranian gunfire was aimed at 
iraqi positions and that an iraqi soldier was killed 
in addition iranian forces attempted to approach the border 
in various sectors and reinforced their units in forward 
positions and redeployed in new areas the agency said 
irans commander and chief and parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani said iraq is trying to rekindle the flames of war 
by claiming sovereignty over the disputed shattalarab waterway a 
major sticking point in the negotiations 
a 1975 treaty split the waterway down the middle but iraq 
claims the pact is void and has made ownership of the entire 
waterway along the southern border a key issue at the peace talks 
tehran radio and the official islamic republic news agency 
monitored in cyprus said rafsanjani spoke at a prayer sermon at 
tehran university 
we call on the armed forces to observe the ceasefire fully 
but if the enemy commits an offense then it is only just that we 
should answer him he said we should preserve our full 
preparedness at the fronts until we arrive at a lasting peace

forecasters said 
the mexican government posted hurricane warnings from punta 
jerez to vera cruz for debby which had winds of 75 mph making it

gaining strength as it approached the coast

strengthen rapidly in this area without much warning gerrish

mexico moving west at 7 mph the center was located at 208 
degrees north latitude and 970 degrees west longitude

more than 60 iowans returned home friday 
after 10 days in idaho harvesting surplus hay to replace forage the 
drought has cost them and they were greeted by friends relatives 
and gov terry branstad 
i just want you to know the people of iowa appreciate what 
youve done branstad told the workers as you know 1988 has 
been a rough year and we are proud of the way our farmers have 
handled it sometimes the worst of times bring out the best in 
people 
residents brought out coffee and donuts to greet the 64 workers 
when the buses rolled in at 720 am 
the workers all volunteers and including both farmers and 
nonfarmers said they were tired but enjoyed the experience 
there were long days and a lot of hard work but a lot of fun 
to go with it said lane schuldt a livestock farmer from near 
van wert 
the buses also made other stops friday morning in bevington 
osceola chariton and albia 
the iowans boarded buses in those communities aug 21 and joined 
volunteers from other midwest states in harvesting more than 10000 
bales of hay the hay came from setaside land that was opened for 
emergency harvesting by the us department of agriculture in 
response to the drought that stunted grass in midwest fields 
the hay will be distributed first to farmers who made the trip 
or sent workers on the trip said bill belden farm bureau regional 
manager in monroe county noting that some farmers could not leave 
but instead hired workers to go to idaho 
others high on the list for the hay are needy farmers who could 
not make the trip because of age or health 
many iowa livestock producers were faced with potential 
liquidation of their herds this hay will maybe held tide them 
over branstad said 
i need some hay said schuldt who isnt sure how much he 
will receive 
some of the workers are not farmers but took the trip anyway 
i just wanted to help out said dave pomeroy who lives in 
pomeroy and holds a nonfarm job in webster city 
its been a lot of fun he said it was very nice id 
never been out there 
the project was coordinated by farm bureau officials in iowa and 
idaho they arranged free transportation by greyhound buses and 
free rail shipment of the hay by burlington northern food lodging 
and haying equipment in idaho were donated by local businesses and 
farmers 
its beautiful country out there and i couldnt believe the 
way the people treated us said schuldt 
they were excellent people pomeroy said we ate well all 
the way 
the hay is not due to arrive for several days so arrangements 
must still be made to unload it from the train and haul it to 
farms and belden said more volunteers are being sought for that 
job 
the governor said he called idaho gov cecil andrus on thursday 
to express his thanks 
maybe the time will come when theyll need our help and we

alexander solzhenitsyn expelled in 1974 for 
writing about the horrors of josef stalins rule was invited to 
join an official committee building a monument to the dictators 
victims an organizer said friday 
the move does not necessarily mean an easing in official 
attitudes toward the dissident writer but it is due to the number 
of soviet citizens who think solzhenitsyn is one of the best 
qualified people to serve on the committee said organizer yuri 
samadunov 
the 1970 nobel laureates masterwork the gulag archipelago 
traces the history of political repression in the soviet union and 
dwells at length on the purges and widespread repression that 
marred the 29year reign of stalin 
solzhenitsyn who spent eight years in labor camps under stalin 
was expelled from the soviet union after the publication of the 
gulag trilogy in the west he now lives in cavendish vt 
under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev stalin and his legacy 
have come in for increasingly severe criticism in july the ruling 
communist party politburo approved the building of a monument in 
moscow to stalin victims 
on aug 25 a public council to supervise the construction and 
maintenance of the monument was formed as well as an executive 
committee to submit a blueprint for the memorials design 
among those selected for the public council were solzhenitsyn 
fellow dissident and nobel peace prize laureate andrei d sakharov 
poet yevgeny yevtushenko and boris yeltsin the fiery former moscow 
party boss 
samadunov a member of the executive committee said the members 
of the public council were chosen in street polls conducted at two 
central moscow locations as well as from names submitted by 
readers to literaturnaya gazeta ogonyok and other staterun 
publications 
we chose the first 17 people mentioned and solzhenitsyn was 
among them said samadunov in a telephone interview this weeks 
edition of moscow news listed solzhenitsyn as a member of the 
public council charged with building the memorial 
but samadunov said the committee had not yet been able to notify 
solzhenitsyn that he had been selected for the committee or to 
determine whether he would agree to take part in its work 
we sent him a telegram with news of his selection and that of 
the others and asked his agreement but the telegram was returned

republican george bush kept up his attack on 
democrat michael dukakis environmental record accusing the 
massachusetts governor of seeking to pollute the waters of new 
jersey where sewage has closed beaches 
in fiery remarks bush stood on a sunny new jersey beach and 
told supporters he has one question for his democratic opponent 
why did you pledge a clean ocean to the people of new jersey 
when your own state applied to pollute it 
displaying the feisty campaign style he has recently adopted 
bush shouted with disdain as he referred to a 1985 application from 
dukakis as governor of massachusetts to dump his states waste in 
an ocean dump site 106 miles off new jersey 
for almost two years he fought to allow bostons sludge to be 
dumped off new jerseys shore the very shore on which he had the 
nerve to stand and promise clean water nice guy yeah bush 
said sarcastically 
he told the beachclad crowd of supporters that if dukakis comes 
to their shores on another campaign trip be sure to ask him 
why did you want to dump boston sludge off our coast in new 
jersey 
a compromise allowed massachusetts to dump further out beyond 
the continental shelf 
bush was heckled by dukakis supporters who chanted where was 
george and carried signs ridiculing the reagan adminisrations 
environmental protection agency as being weak 
but the few hundred bush supporters who had tickets to enter the 
roped off beach section where he spoke drowned out the protesters 
with chants of we want george 
at one point a plane flew over pulling a banner with the words 
where was teddy kennedy it was the massachusetts senator one 
who made the where was george line a democratic rallying cry 
in his speech at the partys convention this summer 
bush laughed when he saw the plane saying where did that guy 
come from 
then he said so i was home with barbara whats wrong with 
that 
the remark appeared to be an oblique version to a quip making 
the rounds of republican circles that bush was home dry and in bed 
with his wife a pointed reference to the time kennedy drove his 
car off a bridge at chappaquidick after a party and a young woman 
passenger drowned 
bush told the crowd that nobody fools nature over the long 
run he said he would fight to ban ocean dumping forever and 
would make the enforcement of superfund the prosecution of 
polluters and the cleanup of toxic waste a top priority 
bush was introduced by new jersey gov thomas kean and later 
was met on a delaware stop by gov michael castle and former gov 
pete du pont who sought the gop presidential nomination earlier 
this year 
bush wen to historical new castle del for another 
environmental speech and a crabbling demonstration 
in an interview with a group of outdoor reporters and editors 
bush who has been saying i am an environmentalist at every 
campaign stop in recent days said he was also a sportsman who has 
fished and hunted for years 
anybody who loves these outdoor sports as much as i do has to 
be concerned with clean water he said 
bush avoided reporters questions about dukakis decision to 
rehire john sasso a former campaign manager who quit last year 
because he distributed a videotape that helped drive delaware sen 
joseph biden out of the democratic presidential race 
i havent thought about it bush said at one point 
but later while bobbing around in boats in the delaware river 
for a crabbing demonstration reporters shouted questions about 
sasso across the water 
the vice president at first shook his head and then held up one 
of the crabs in the boat saying speaking of crabs

cigarette manufacturers collectively bought 
3772 million pounds of fluecured tobacco last season about 6 
percent more than the companies had indicated they would purchase 
the agriculture department said friday 
vern neppl acting administrator of the departments 
agricultural stabilization and conservation service said the 
purchases covered the period from july 1 1987 through june 30 
1988 
neppl said the companies had stated they planned to buy 355 
million pounds during the marketing year by law companies are 
penalized if they fail to purchase at least 90 percent of the 
quantity they state as their intentions 
because crop marketings were below the 1987 effective quota for 
fluecured tobacco the manufacturers needed to purchase only 831 
percent of their intended quantity neppl said

kentucky wants signs welcoming travelers 
at all highway points of entry to be letter perfect 
so it is replacing some that dropped the middle initial g 
from gov wallace wilkinsons name 
transportation secretary milo d bryant said failing to use the 
g for glenn in the governors name amounts to misspelling 
the name 
obviously its not correct thats not his name that he was 
sworn in as governor bryant said 
the error occurred earlier this year bryant said he said an 
alert supervisor noticed that workers were leaving out the g 
the signs the department has made since the discovery bear the 
initial 
bryant estimated only 1012 signs are being changed at a cost 
of perhaps 44 for each he was unsure of labor costs and other 
expenses in the replacement project but said it might be in the 
200 to 300 range 
it was not a big deal bryant said 
richard jones who recently saw a crew of three men and two 
trucks working to remove one of the signs on the suspension bridge 
between covington and cincinnati said he thought the action was 
a waste of money 
i figure the money they used on that could have gone out here 
to help the poor people on the street said jones a 43yearold 
retiree from the navy who rarely uses his middle initial h 
for henry 
who ordered the change is unclear bryant said he wasnt sure 
he said he did not receive instructions from the governor or his 
staff to change them 
i doubt the governor even knows about it he said

mikhail s gorbachevs antidrinking campaign and 
the chernobyl nuclear plant accident have helped put the soviet 
union budget in the red by many billions of rubles an 
economist reported friday 
v bochkov writing in the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya said 
many specialists estimate the deficit as equal to 15 percent to 17 
percent of state revenues 
the economist did not give a specific figure but said the 
soviet deficit was many billions of rubles an amount he said 
was nearly half of what is being spent to meet the countrys social 
and cultural needs 
the communist partys policymaking central committee in a july 
plenary meeting said that when next years state budget and 
economic plan are drawn up it will be necessary to take decisive 
steps to cut the deficit 
the 1988 government budget as approved by the supreme soviet 
parliament in october totals 773 billion in his article bochkov 
specifically noted 66 billion in unforeseen expenses or revenue 
shortfalls 
lower world prices for oil and oil products a major soviet 
export item have led to a 23 billion drop in foreign income 
slashes in the production of vodka and other alcoholic drinks 
a key measure in gorbachevs 3yearold antidrinking campaign 
have resulted in a 30 billion drop in state revenue from alcohol 
sales 
finally an additional 126 billion have been spent to cope 
with the aftermath of the 1986 nuclear reactor explosion and fire 
at the chernobyl power plant which sparked the evacuation of more 
than 130000 residents of the northern ukraine and southern 
byelorussia 
bochkov said that more than 70 percent of soviet national income 
is redistributed through the state budget in line with gorbachevs 
drive to make each sector of the soviet economy selfsufficient 
bochkov called for a decisive move to selffinancing 
however many soviet factories and enterprises are still far 
from being able to stand on their own feet and meet expenses 
through their own revenues and depend on periodic injections of 
government funds 
bochkov said soviet warehouses and store shelves are now clogged 
with 746 billion in goods that no one wants to buy and since the 
products remain unsold the state earns no revenue from them 
in his article the economist also issued an indirect call for 
slimmeddown defense spending saying as in any sector of the 
expenditure of budgetary resources in the military sector there is 
also the possibility of economy 
the soviet unions 1988 budget officially allocates 32 billion 
for defense but western analysts contend actual soviet military 
spending is many times that figure

the israeli army said friday it was working for 
the speedy release of an air navigator captured in lebanon last 
year and that it holds the lebanese amal militia responsible for 
his health 
a statement from the military command read to reporters by 
telephone said israel questioned the credibility and source of 
recent reports from lebanon that the navigator ron arad 30 was in 
poor health 
but it said israel stresses and reiterates it considers the 
amal organization and its leader lebanese justice minister 
nabih berri responsible for the health and safety of the navigator 
and hopes all necessary steps will be taken in keeping with this 
responsibility 
israel will continue to work to return the navigator safe and 
sound as soon as possible said the statement which also was 
broadcast by israel radio 
lebanese miltiamen shot down arads phantom fighter with a 
shoulderlaunched sam7 missile during an oct 16 bombing mission 
in south lebanon the pilot was rescued by helicopter 
after his capture israel announced that arad was being held by 
amal a shiite moslem group and rival to the proiranian hezbollah 
movement 
the armys statement follows a radio appeal by arads wife 
tami who said she and their 3yearold daughter had not received 
any information about her husband in more than a year 
the hardest thing is the uncertainty and lack of contact 
mrs arad told israel army radio on july 21 if i could only know 
how he is and what he does and whether hes in good health it 
would be easier 
she also urged her husband to be strong we shall do 
everything so that we can be together soon she said we 
believe in you and cross our fingers for you 
five other israelis are missing in action in lebanon 
two captured in 1986 are believed held by hezbollah three 
others have been reported missing since a tank battle with syrian 
forces in eastern lebanon on june 11 1982

have been tested i cant say each one had safety defects 
the navy is informing its fleet and is organizing an effort to 
deal with the problems the spokesman said 
our inspector general has been seriously involved with 
concerns over the safety of the mk6 and definitely is soliciting 
inputs from all the involved agencies in the navy he said

the george bush campaign tried to hire an 
employee of the voice of america to translate statements by the 
republican nominee into greek for michael dukakis natural 
constituency of greekamerican voters according to agency 
documents and personnel 
the overture to an editor at the federally financed overseas 
radio network prompted the voas general counsel to issue a 
memorandum warning eployees against violating the 1939 hatch act 
which bars federal workers from taking part in partisan political 
activities 
voa spokeswoman judy jamison said the agencys chief lawyer 
was prepared to recommend against accepting the bush campaigns 
job offer but never did because the editor said he wasnt 
interested in taking it 
the employee george bistis said in a memo that he received a 
call aug 23 offering him an eightweek assignment translating 
several texts of news about bush or statements by him that were 
intended for greekamericans 
in the memo a copy of which was obtained by the associated 
press bistis said he told the caller eva neterowicz that 
believed such an assignment would violate the hatch act 
she answered that in her opinion there is no conflict because 
the job offered involved translating services rather than engaging 
in political activity bistis said 
after all she remarked other people at voa are working for 
us and they dont seem to think that there is any conflict with the 
hatch act bistis quoted her as saying 
ms neterowicz chief of the nationalities department of the 
bush campaign confirmed in an interview that she had tried to hire 
voa employees for parttime jobs providing translations for 26 
ethnic groups including greekamericans at 50 per text 
she said that we were told there was no problem with hiring 
voa personnel but she said all her translators currently are from 
private business and none is from the voa 
bistis supervisor andreas antypas deputy chief of voas 
european division wrote the congressional general accounting 
office giving details of the incident and mentioning the case of 
another employee from the voas hungarian service who had performed 
translations for the bush campaign 
i find it highly objectionable that any political organization 
should feel free to fish around in the voa for translators of 
partisan political material antypas wrote 
gao official paul atkins said he relayed the antypas memo to the 
general counsel of the congressional watchdog agency 
voa spokeswoman jamison said the agency receives dozens of 
requests for translators because many of its employees are 
multilingual in this case of course it was different because 
were talking about a political campaign she said 
she said she did not know of any other agency employees who were 
approached by the bush campaign but said a voa engineer had asked 
for a threemonth leave to work for the dukakis campaign 
the voa general counsels memo said there may be very limited 
and specific cases in which outside jobs associated with partisan 
politics are permissible but he said employees must receive his 
written approval in advance before accepting them

the american work force is in its best shape 
ever despite a drop in manufacturing jobs and a dramatic slowdown 
in service industry hiring labor secretary ann mclaughlin said 
friday 
employment is still at record levels and thats good ms 
mclaughlin said in the second state of the workforce address 
delivered before the chicago federation of labor her predecessor 
william brock gave the first such address in philadelphia last 
year 
the state of the work force in 1988 is good and getting better 
the best it has ever been but it isnt as good as it can be 
she said 
if workers managers government and unions can cooperate 
we can offer a job to everyone in this country who wants one 
provided theyre educated skilled and prepared for the 
workplace ms mclaughlin said 
the key labor issue is no longer unemployment its the 
unemployable she said in the future more than ever before the 
unemployed will be the underskilled she said 
ms mclaughlins speech followed the labor departments release 
friday of unemployment figures for august which showed the 
nations jobless rate rose to 56 percent last month 
it was the second straight monthly increase the july rate of 
54 percent was 01 higher than junes 53 percent a 14year low 
ms mclaughlin said the jobless rate had been fluctuating 
between 53 percent and 56 percent since march 
she praised the reagan administration for creating 17 million 
new jobs in the past five years and called for efforts to educate 
and train workers with and without jobs 
the day must never come when we have a worker deficit in this 
country because weve failed as a nation to provide opportunities 
for excellence and relevance in education training and 
retraining she said 
ms mclaughlin left out attacks on the democratic party in a 
departure from her prepared text which contained a reference to 
democrats in congress who in 1982 tried to pass what she called a 
costly public jobs program with a 35 million price tag 
she also did not mention democratic presidential candidate 
michael dukakis by name referring to him only as the other 
candidate in acknowledging his endorsement last week by the 
aflcio an endorsement supported by the chicago federation 
but ms mclaughlin criticized the massachusetts governor as 
not terribly economically astute and literate at a news 
conference after her speech 
in 1983 she said massachusetts lost 45000 manufacturing jobs 
while 1 million jobs were created nationwide 
the labor department reported the goodsproducing side of the 
economy lost jobs in august for the first time since last january 
employment in manufacturing was down by 5000 after a 70000 jump 
in july 
susan estrich dukakiss campaign manager said from boston that 
the loss of those jobs was a blow to hopes for prosperity in the 
nations heartland and to hopes of easing the squeeze on working 
americans

the national labor relations board has filed 
a complaint seeking to invalidate writers guild of america rules 
that limit members ability to quit the union during a strike 
its like an indictment we are a prosecutor alleging a 
violation of the law said sidney rosen a regional nlrb officer 
the unfair labor practices complaint filed thursday supports 
an action filed by 21 dissident members of the wga during the 
guilds 154day strike against movie and television producers the 
strike one of the longest in entertainment industry history ended 
last month 
the dissidents and the nlrb argue that the guilds constitution 
illegally allows the union to fine writers for working during a 
strike even if the writers resign from the union before going back 
to work 
the complaint called for a nov 3 hearing before an 
administrative law judge in los angeles and could eventually lead 
to a hearing before the labor board in washington 
wga officers said they hadnt been served with the complaint in 
a statement however the guild said it expects to prevail in the 
lawsuit before the nlrb or on appeal to the federal courts if 
necessary the guild also argued that the issue is moot now that 
the strike is over 
lionel chetwynd one of the 21 writers who signed the original 
complaint said a guild official recently urged the dissidents to 
drop their complaint but he disputed the notion that the complaint 
is hurting the guild 
clearly there are deep problems with the guild you could 
look at this as a first step in clearing away the debris and 
getting our constitution in line with the law of the land 
chetwynd said thursday

the soviet union has bought an additional 
800000 metric tons of us corn for delivery during the 198889 
marketing year that began thursday the agriculture department said 
friday 
sale of 100000 tons of corn was announced a day earlier also 
for delivery in 198889 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 900000 tons of 
corn would be about 355 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 249 per bushel at the 
farm level meaning that the two sales could have a farm value of 
around 884 million 
there was no indication whether the new sales of corn would 
count under the current longterm grain supply agreement between 
the two countries or be carried forward separately in case a new 
pact is forthcoming 
the current fiveyear pact is set to expire sept 30 and 
negotiators are currently trying to work out a new one or at least 
an extension of the current agreement to take effect oct 1 
arthur k homann of the departments foreign agricultural 
service said it would be determined later how to count the latest 
corn sales depending on the actual shipping dates and whether 
there is a new agreement 
regardless the soviet union has already lived up to terms of 
the final year of the agreement which calls for the annual 
purchase of at least 9 million tons of us grain 
according to the agreement the annual purchases are supposed to

the government said friday leftist 
guerrillas will be allowed to present their ideas on political 
economic and social change to congress if they accept a ceasefire 
president virgilio barco outlined the proposal in a televised 
address thursday night and government minister cesar gaviria gave 
details friday 
barco said guerrilla violence must end before direct contacts 
are made 
guerrilla violence has claimed more than 75000 lives in 20 
years and the estimated numerical strength of rebel groups has 
grown from 2500 to 10000 in a decade 
over the past year the guerrillas have blown up oil pipelines 45 
times attacked 14 towns set off car bombs attacked military 
bases ambushed army patrols and destroyed bridges electricity 
transmission towers and other government facilities 
they have kidnapped dozens of ranchers for ransom since the 
early 1980s and also have a us captive jake gambini of houston 
tex owner of general pipe co he was kidnapped two months ago 
from an oil company camp in colombias eastern plains but there 
have been no reports of ransom demands 
gaviria who is in charge of internal security said preliminary 
contacts with guerrillas can begin as soon as they end hostilities 
after the ceasefire and initial contacts the rebels would be 
allowed to give congress their proposals for change the minister 
said in an interview with the rcn radio network 
barco said thursday night the peace plans objective was 
disbanding the guerrilla groups and he repeated an amnesty offer 
made last month 
this is the second time a colombian government has tried to 
negotiate with the insurgents in 1982 president belisario 
betancur offered an amnesty and signed a truce with four of 
colombias six rebel armies 
only about 300 guerrillas accepted pardons and the ceasefire 
collapsed with rebels and the military accusing each other of 
violating it 
barcos plan differs in two important aspects provisions for 
direct negotiations with the government and submission of guerrilla 
proposals to congress 
betancur met with guerrilla representatives twice but his 
negotiators were not government officials which led the rebels to 
suspect he did not take the process seriously 
gaviria said the proporsed negotations would be handled by 
himself and barcos personal representative for guerrilla contacts 
rafael pardo rueda who was appointed last year and has met with 
guerrilla leaders several times 
no guerrilla reaction is expected for several days gaviria said 
the insurgents were not given details in advance

michael dukakis gearing up for a very tough very 
competitive general election campaign announced friday he was 
rehiring john sasso his longtime political strategist who resigned 
after anonymously triggering events that forced sen joseph biden 
out of the democratic primary campaign 
its going to be a battle royal for the presidency of the 
united states dukakis said announcing that his pugnacious 
former campaign manager was returning as vice chairman of his 
campaign 
sassos return came as republican opponent george bush kept 
pounding away at the massachusetts governor and amid polls that 
showed dukakis and bush were locked in a deadheat with the labor 
day campaign kickoff just days away 
standing on a new jersey beach friday the gop nominee accused 
dukakis of contributing to its occasional pollution by arranging to 
have sludge from massachusetts dumped in nearby ocean waters 
almost a year ago john sasso made a very serious mistake 
dukakis said in california hes paid the price 
sasso stepped down last year after admitting that he distributed 
a videotape showing that sen joseph biden of delaware then a 
candidate for the democratic presidential nomination had borrowed 
virtually verbatim excerpts from a speech once delivered by british 
labor party leader neil kinnock 
that videotape and subsequent charges of plagiarism forced biden 
to drop out of the race 
dukakis said biden could not have been more gracious when 
told that sasso was returning to his campaign 
biden in a statement issued by his senate office said i 
continue to support governor dukakis 
sasso speaking at a news conference in boston with campaign 
chairman paul brountas and manager susan estrich apologized for 
the incident and said he did not intend to raise questions about 
bidens character 
dukakis has seen his doubledigit lead over bush in the polls 
evaporate since the republican national convention last month when 
the gop launched a sustained attack on the democratic nominee 
nevertheless dukakis said sassos return was not a reflection 
of disarray in his campaign 
its simply the fact were looking at a little more than two 
months of what is going to be a very tough very competitive 
campaign dukakis said adding that he wanted to assemble the 
strongest team i possibly can 
craig fuller bushs chief of staff said the return of sasso 
speaks for itself but gop vice presidential nominee dan quayle 
was more blunt i would say that this is another sign that the 
dukakis campaign is in serious trouble 
bush stood friday before a group of supporters clad in beach 
attire to keep up his attack on dukakis environmental record 
for almost two years he fought to allow bostons sludge to be 
dumped off new jerseys shore the very shore on which he had the 
nerve to stand and promise clean water bush said nice guy 
yeah 
bush spoke on a beach at belmar nj which has been closed 
from time to time because of sludge that was dumped off the coast 
and then drifted ashore 
why did you pledge a clean ocean to the people of new jersey 
when your own state applied to pollute it bush asked 
while dukakis applied in 1985 to have his states sludge dumped 
106 miles off the new jersey coast a later agreement allowed 
massachusetts to unload it farther out to sea beyond the 
continental shelf 
earlier in the week bush sailed into heavily polluted boston 
harbor and accused dukakis of neglect and stalling and doing too 
little to clean up the waters of his own home port 
the vice president appears intent on wooing members of dukakis 
own greekamerican constituency a bush campaign official tried 
without success to recruit an employee of the federally financed 
voice of america to translate the gop candidates speeches and 
statements into greek 
the employee george bistis did not accept the offer and the 
voa general counsel warned in a memorandum that any voa staffer 
taking such an assignment would be violating the hatch act which 
bars federal workers from taking part in partisan political 
campaigns 
i find it highly objectionable that any political organization 
should feel free to fish around in the voa for translators of 
partisan political material andreas antypas deputy chief of 
voas european division wrote in a memo obtained by the associated 
press

the adolph coors co and its local 
distributor on friday sued a man who claimed to have found a mouse 
in a 16ounce can of coors beer 
the lawsuit filed in duval circuit court accuses james harvey of 
fraud and deceit product disparagement defamation and attempted 
theft by deception in connection with his claims 
the lawsuit which says tests have shown the mouse did not enter 
the can at the brewery also accuses the jacksonville man of 
intentional interference with advantageous business 
relationships 
no specific cash amount is demanded in the suit 
what has happened to coors should not happen to anyone said 
cary baird a coors spokeswoman at company headquarters in golden 
colo 
the public recognition of coors commitment to quality 
products and consumer satisfaction is the companys most valuable 
asset and coors and its jacksonville distributor neal tyler and 
sons have incurred severe damage as a result of this incident 
she said 
coors would have no further comment on the incident until the 
matter is settled in court she added 
harvey whose telephone number is unlisted could not be reached 
for comment and his attorney gary pajcic was out of town and 
unavailable 
harvey 30 a construction worker has said he purchased a can 
of coors july 27 at a jacksonville liquor store took a few sips 
and became ill 
on aug 3 harvey took the can to the jacksonville health 
department to have the lid removed and a sixinch mouse was 
discovered 
after harvey reported the find to coors the company offered him 
1500 for the can and its contents so they could be analyzed 
harvey refused demanding 30000 to 50000 coors said 
coors sued harvey for the right to analyze the can and its 
contents and a judge ordered an autopsy on the mouse and allowed 
coors to take the can to colorado for tests 
ms baird said aug 18 that an examination of the mouse by a 
university of florida veterinary pathologist found the animal had 
been dead for only a short time while the beer can had been sealed 
in colorado 77 days before the rodent was found 
she said that proved that the mouse did not get into the can at 
the brewery the uf examination also noted abrasions on the mouses 
sides 
a pathologist hired by pajcic said the assumptions made by coors 
on the basis of the autopsy were not necessary correct and that 
the alcohol in the beer could have preserved the mouse thus making 
it impossible to determine when it died

usbacked rebels have been 
defeated but the sandinista government will maintain its large army 
because of the threat of an invasion by american troops the 
defense minister said friday 
humberto ortega said the rebels are strategically defeated 
but the government will not reduce it 80000member armed forces 
the biggest in central america 
we cant have a lesser level he said citing the presence 
of rebel units across the border in honduras and what he called the 
threat of us military intervention 
ortega said the rebels known as contras were in an 
irreversible situation with no hope for victory 
the contras began fighting the leftist government in 1981 the 
sandinistas came to power in july 1979 in the civil war that ousted 
president anastasio somoza after 42 years of rule by the somoza 
family 
ortega spoke with reporters after addressing a crowd of soldiers 
at an army day ceremony with him at san jacinto 25 miles north of 
the capital of managua were his brother president daniel ortega 
vice president sergio ramirez and agrarian reform minister jaime 
wheelock 
the defense minister said the rebels still hoped to obtain 
renewed us military aid cut off at the end of february and that 
the reagan administration was attempting to provoke a conflict 
between honduran and nicaraguan troops to justify direct american 
military intervention 
the united states sent more than 3000 soldiers to honduras in 
march in response to a sandinistas border crossing into honduras 
but then withdrew the troops 
enrique bermudez a contra directors said friday that a loss of 
us support for the rebels could mean the blood of american 
soldiers 
a transcript of a rebel radio liberaction broadcast quoted 
bermudez as saying the contras are fighting for democracy in 
central america 
most of the rebels fled during the past four months across the 
northern border to base camps in honduras washington provides 
nonlethal aid to the contras at the camps 
the sandinistas and the contras signed a ceasefire pact march 
23 but highlevel talks to work out the mechanics of a permanent 
truce in the 7yearold war stalemated in june both sides accuse 
the other of violating the march agreement to suspend offensive 
military operations 
the defense minister said that the sandinistas were ready to 
renew the talks but that they had to be held in managua the 
capital the contras refuse to return to managua saying they were 
barred from circulating freely 
humbero ortega repeated the sandinista governments estimate 
that there are 6000 contras and he said 70 percent of them were in 
honduras rebel officials say more than 10000 combatants are in 
honduras and about 2000 remain in nicaragua

friday agreeing to continue the nicaraguan truce past its formal 
aug 31 expiration date 
the sandinistas had previously announced they would not initiate 
any action against the contra rebels although both sides have 
accused each other of violating the truce 
only four of the contras seven directors signed their letter 
dated thursday and addressed to victor tinoco deputy secretary of 
the sandinista foreign ministry 
contra spokesman jorge rosales said the other three directors 
including hardline military leader enrique bermudez were out of 
town 
the truce was originally declared earlier this year to permit 
peace talks between the two sides but the contras have refused 
further meetings inside nicaragua as the sandinistas wanted and 
the talks are at a standstill

sponsors of a calendar that featured 
photos of young single dakotas farmers squandered profits on 
parties rather than keeping a promise to funnel money to 
financially strapped farmers the state attorney general said 
friday 
a lawsuit filed in state district court accused the sponsors of 
the dakota men calendar of fraud it seeks to stop sales of the 
calendars 1989 edition freeze the assets of the sponsors 
corporation and stop the corporation from claiming nonprofit 
status said attorney general nicholas spaeth 
he said an audit of the sponsors organization turned up some 
very questionable transactions 
it is clear that a lot of this money went for elaborate 
parties at which dakota men were present and a lot of food 
and liquor spaeth said at a news conference 
it is clear that at best this organization and its 
principals never made any serious effort to fulfill any charitable 
purposes spaeth said 
one of the defendants roger jaeger denied wrongdoing in a 
telephone interview friday from the groups office in fargo jaeger 
is former head of the sponsors nonprofit corporation food inc 
or farmers of ongoing determination 
we have been operating a good business jaeger said 
food was started in 1986 to solicit charitable contributions to 
raise money to retrain displaced farmers help them deal with the 
stress of tough times and make grants for such things as food and 
clothing spaeth said 
a letter printed on the cover of the 1989 calendar which sells 
for 895 claims the corporation has returned money to farm 
relief organizations helping farmers cope with the stress of their 
business and providing scholarships job retraining and immediate 
food clothing and shelter 
but evidence indicates the calendars sponsors personally 
profited by the sales spaeth said he also alleged the sponsors 
used a california company to skim off some of the profits 
the lawsuit seeks restitution for all misappropriated money 
which spaeth said could total as much as 40000 
defendants in the lawsuit include food and lawrence jaeger 
roger jaeger perry miller ruth elbert and karen tyndall 
the jaegers and elbert are siblings said spaeth who called the 
defendants a very very tightknit group of people 
for the year ending in april food earned 175508 in total 
revenues but no money was contributed to charity spaeth said 
since april food has given 2000 to the north dakota mental 
health association spaeth said 
roger jaeger said friday his organization had made no other 
contributions that is getting at questions i cant answer at 
this time there is a reason 
the calendars feature a farmer from north or south dakota each 
month jaeger is mr february on the 1988 calendar the 
accompanying copy beneath his photo says in part look deep into 
his eyes and you see a man who appreciates women honesty 
dependability and a good reputation 
evidence indicates that tyndall set up her own company in 
california kmgl and arranged for food to buy the dakota men 
calendars from it spaeth said 
in reality kmgl did nothing other than subcontract the work 
out to a california printing company spaeth said 
tyndall billed food for 60226 while work done by the printing 
company cost 52306 he said

the american bishops have prepared a draft of a pastoral letter on

about their dignity and vocation the pope said 
john pauls document is expected to be released after he returns 
from a trip to africa later this month

the power with which divine truth is invested at the service of 
the cause of women in the modern world to help clarify their 
correlative rights and duties while defending their feminine 
dignity and vocation the pontiff said 
the importance of true christian feminism is so great that 
every effort must be made to present the principles on which this 
cause is based and according to which it can be effectively 
defended and promoted for the good of all humanity 
the draft of the us pastoral letter titled partners in the 
mystery of redemption a pastoral response to womens concerns for 
church and society was issued in april 
a final draft is expected to be presented to the full body of

visit to defend the family in particular from drug trafficking

a sobbing mother warned us marshals friday 
not to harm her son who remained a fugitive three days after a 
federal court ordered him returned to jail on hostagetaking 
charges 
eddie hatcher 30 an american indian is accused with timothy 
jacobs 20 of taking up to 20 people hostage feb 1 at the offices 
of the robesonian newspaper in lumberton in what they said was a 
protest of alleged corruption and discrimination against minorities 
by robeson county law enforcement officials 
the siege ended after 10 hours when gov jim martin agreed to 
form a state task force to investigate their allegations 
hatcher failed to surrender at the us marshals office in 
raleigh when his bond was revoked wednesday and a federal arrest 
warrant was issued thursday said chief deputy dwight rich jacobs 
surrendered wednesday 
if anything happens to my son i will hold the federal 
government responsible hatchers mother thelma clark said at a 
news conference outside a hospital where she underwent back surgery 
this week 
mrs clark said her son had followed the terms of his 100000 
bond before it was revoked he kept all the rules they gave 
him she said he is not a criminal 
hatcher and jacobs spent five months in jail before a 
threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court of appeals ruled in 
june they had not been given a bond hearing soon enough after their 
arrest 
hatcher and jacobs were denied bond twice by a us magistrate 
and once by a us district court judge they were ordered back 
into custody when the entire appeals court agreed to reconsider the 
case at the request of assistant us attorney john bruce who 
challenged the terms of their release 
a lawyer representing hatcher said friday he has asked to have 
the federal warrant revoked because it was issued without a hearing 
and prosecutors had not demonstrated that hatcher posed a danger to 
the community while free on bond 
he lived where he was supposed to honored his curfew and 
travel restrictions reported religiously to the probation office 
and submitted to urinalysis attorney barry nakell said at a 
news conference in carrboro near chapel hill

oral roberts university has reduced 
scholarship funds available to medical students and eliminated 
salaries for graduates who serve as medical missionaries for the 
university 
the move is the latest modification in the medical missionary 
program that was the object of evangelist oral roberts widely 
publicized 1987 fundraising effort in which he claimed he might 
die if donors didnt come forward 
under the revised scholarship program firstyear medical 
students are no longer eligible for scholarship aid offered to 
those who plan to become missionaries 
other medical students who sign contracts promising to work as 
missionaries are to receive up to 20000 in scholarship aid while 
they are in school university officials said thursday previously 
participants were eligible for up to 24000 
in addition the students will no longer be eligible for 22000 
salaries after graduation when they do the missionary work 
in january 1987 donations to the medical missionary scholarship 
program were falling when roberts issued a nationwide plea for 8 
million he said if he did not raise the money by april 1 1987 
god would call me home to heaven 
although oral roberts officials announced the goal was met 
roberts discontinued the scholarship program a year later amid much 
criticism three months after that he reinstated it 
students who withdraw from the program may continue to attend 
oral roberts said dr larry edwards dean of the medical school 
but they have to pay back whatever has been given them in 
scholarship money 
the medical student scholarship program was begun as a pilot 
project for a few students in 1985 at the end of last semester 
105 students were receiving scholarships 
the school now has 168 medical students enrolled including 46 
firstyear students 
the firstyear students are not being offered scholarships 
edwards said because officials want to get to know them during 
this school year to make sure they are truly called to be 
missionaries before offering aid

four hostages and heavily armed police 
swat teams spent several tense hours friday waiting out two holdup 
men until the hostages safely made a break for it and police 
discovered the pair had fled 
the hostages spent 3 hours inside a closet believing the holdup 
men were still in the bank then dashed from the building in a bid 
for freedom police said no one was hurt 
heavily armed officers had spent the morning assuming the four 
bank employees were being held hostage after the four ran out 
officers fired two rounds of tear gas into the bank searched it 
and found no one inside 
its ironic the way it worked out said officer douglas r 
anderson of the metro police department we were here to play it 
out until the end we dont feel silly 
an allpoints bulletin for two men was issued when police came 
out of the downtown bank branch around noon without the suspects 
the four hostages three women and a man were being debriefed 
friday afternoon at police headquarters 
police did not know how the two burglars were able to enter the 
third national bank through a broken rear window without triggering 
an alarm 
the bank employees told police one man carried a sawedoff 
shotgun and the other had a knife anderson said 
police said they did not know if any money was taken 
the fbi tried to communicate with those inside by using a 
bullhorn anderson said but received no response telephone calls 
to the bank during the four hours went unanswered 
the four employees ran from the onestory granite building and 
were hustled into a police mobile command unit and whisked away 
anderson said the burglars apparently were already in the bank 
when the workers arrived about 730 am the burglars forced them 
into the closet then apparently fled after another bank worker 
arrived saw something was going on and went to a nearby business 
and called police 
it was a burglary and they came in to wait for an armed 
robbery anderson said 
meantime the employees in the closet did not know the intruders 
had left and remained there until their break for freedom 
about 25 police officers and fbi agents surrounded the building 
and stood atop nearby businesses traffic on two streets was 
blocked off for three blocks 
the bank employees were identified as bank manager lattie brown 
45 assistant manager trina chance 40 loan officer brian 
williams 27 and teller dot oats 51

critics accused president augusto 
pinochet on friday of lifting the exile ban only to gain votes but 
whatever the motive many chilean artists and performers will be 
able to work in their own country 
gen pinochet who seeks to win eight more years in office as 
the sole candidate in a presidential referendum oct 5 announced 
thursday that all 430 remaining political exiles may come home 
one daughter of the late president salvador allende overthrown 
in the coup led by pinochet in september 1973 already has returned 
and allendes widow and other daughter have said they will come 
back 
among other people affected is miguel littin an acclaimed movie 
maker whose acts of marusia was nominated for an academy award 
as the best foreign film of 1985 littin and thousands of other 
chileans went into exile soon after the coup 
it will not be littins first return he spent several weeks 
here in 1986 shooting scenes for a documentary on chile but he was 
disguised used an assumed name and posed as a member of an italian 
television crew 
that film general act of chile is critical of the pinochet 
militry regime and has been shown at several european movie 
festivals 
an account of the secret visit was written later by colombian 
author gabriel garcia marquez a nobel laureate and close friend of 
littin 
garcia marquez wrote that littin visited several chilean cities 
and on one occasion stood only a few yards from pinochet while 
filming a ceremony 
on friday the santiago newspaper la epoca quoted littin as 
saying by telephone from his home in madrid that he would return to 
chile in the next few hours or in a week 
littin now is shooting sandino a film about the late 
nicaraguan revolutionary leader cesar augusto sandino with american 
actor dustin hoffman playing the role of sandino 
also expected to return is helvio soto a movie maker who has 
had been working in paris 
two folk groups noted for protest songs inti illimani and 
quilapallun have performed successfully in europe for years 
inti illimani now based in rome was on a us tour when 
pinochet made his announcement 
quilapallun is based in paris it was not known if either group 
planned to return 
patricio manns a folk musician who lives in switzerland also 
can come back in 1986 he became an international spokesman for 
the manuel rodriguez patriotic front chiles main leftist 
guerrilla group 
manns announced in europe that the guerrillas claimed 
responsability for the sept 6 1986 attempt to assasinate 
pinochet the army commander the president escaped harm in the 
ambush of his motorcade on a road in the andes foothills near 
santiago but six bodyguards were killed and 11 wounded 
la epoca quoted manns also a poet and author as saying he had 
not decided whether to return and wanted security guarantees 
from the government 
the chilean journalists association said 32 journalists are 
among the exiles affected they include jose miguel varas a 
communist who lives in moscow and broadcasts a daily radio program 
the voice of chile

relatives of americans who died in the soviet 
downing of a korean airliner on friday called for a full 
congressional investigation into unanswered questions still 
surrounding the 1983 tragedy 
it would be a dangerous precedent to let this matter fade into 
oblivion said nan oldham of bethesda md cochair of a family 
members organization at a news conference marking the fifth 
anniversary of the air disaster 
the sept 1 1983 downing of korean airlines flight 007 claimed 
the lives of all 269 people aboard including 63 americans 
the korean jet which had strayed more than 350 miles off 
course was shot down after passing over soviet territory while on 
a flight from anchorage alaska to seoul south korea 
mrs oldham who lost her 27yearold son john told reporters 
we feel betrayed by our government whose silence in this case 
rationalized by the questionable claim of national security 
concerns is beginning to resemble a deliberate coverup 
it is fitting indeed imperative for congress to conduct a 
fullscale investigation she said armed with its subpoena 
power and the right to examine more than 1200 stillclassified 
documents congress can uncover the truth 
mrs oldham cited a march 9 letter from sens edward m kennedy 
and john f kerry both dmass to sen wendell h ford dky 
requesting an investigation by fords commerce subcommittee on 
aviation the letter was subsequently referred to the senate 
intelligence committee 
the soviets officially have said they shot the plane down 
because they believed it was a us reconnaissance aircraft 
violating soviet airspace 
in their letter kennedy and kerry pointed to a number of 
unresolved matters involving the korean airliner affair 
it is our understanding that there is evidence showing that 
an hour and a half into the flight the faa federal aviation 
administration controller in anchorage alaska knew that kal 007 
was off course and heading for soviet airspace that he considered 
warning the aircraft but refrained from doing so 
there is also reason to believe that important evidence has 
been tampered with that us records were destroyed and that us 
and japanese tapes of communications with the airliner were 
falsified 
in addition it is our understanding that there are two 
contradictory sets of radar tracks both attributed to us radars 
showing kal 007s course one of them must be false kennedy 
and kerry wrote in the letter 
joan piermarini a staff member of the senate intelligence 
committee said she had no comment on prospects for an 
investigation by the panel 
earlier friday about 100 family members attended an interfaith 
memorial service at the washington cathedral which included a 
reading of the names of all 269 victims who came from 17 different 
countries 
among those giving brief eulogies at the service was lois bowden 
of augres mich who lost her mother eleanor bissell 
five years have passed and i have not come to terms with her 
death mrs bowden said 
she added that i will not be able to close the book of her 
life until the questions surrounding the tragedy have been 
resolved 
nancy draughn of lake charles la called the loss of her 
20yearold daughter sarah a tragedy so powerful that it would 
change the course of my life 
we cannot end grieving until we have used this tragedy to 
make a better and safer world she said 
julia lombard of hatboro pa a philadelphia suburb fought to 
hold back tears as she recalled the loss of her husband aiden and 
her brotherinlaw donald 
how can we explain to our kids what we dont even know 
ourselves said mrs lombard who has four children 
another family member canadian philippe robert de massy said 
it may be that we will never know everything that happened 
de massy who lost his younger brother francois said the 
tragedy had brought home to him the need for a new ethical order 
in the relationships between people

three countries and south africas withdrawal of its troops to 
neighboring southwest africa 
rebels fighting south african soldiers in southwest africa or 
namibia also had played no part in the peace talks but said they 
would begin a voluntary ceasefire thursday 
the eight guerrillas were killed that day in a skirmish at 
okankolo a settlement in the northcentral part of the territory 
the military said it gave no report on its own casualties 
military spokesmen said the guerrillas were in a group of 30 
that entered namibia from angola on aug 26 with the aim of 
continuing the organizations armed campaign and intimidation of 
the region 
the continued hostile activities by swapo indicate that 
the organization has no serious intentions of adhering to the 
ceasefire a statement said

president amin gemayel blocked a move 
friday to reinstate a moslemled cabinet in an action that could 
enable him to put a maronite christian in charge 
immediately after the announcement by the presidential office 
christian and moslem militiamen clashed with machine guns 
rocketpropelled grenades and 106mm recoilless cannons across 
beiruts dividing green line police said there was no immediate 
report of casualties 
gemayel rejected the move earlier in the day by acting prime 
minister salim hoss to withdrew his cabinets resignation hoss 
said he was withdrawing the resignation to avert a power vacuum if 
parliament fails to elect a new president in the next three weeks 
we inform you that we have withdrawn the cabinets 
resignation which had been announced by the late premier rashid 
karami hoss a sunni moslem said in a letter to the christian 
president 
karami also a sunni was killed in a helicopter bomb explosion 
june 1 1987 28 days after he announced the resignation of his 
halfmoslem halfchristian cabinet 
after karamis assassination gemayel named hoss acting prime 
minister of the caretaker cabinet 
the presidential palace issued a communique friday rejecting 
hoss move the move would leave gemayel free to name a new interim 
cabinet led by a christian if no new president is in place before 
his term ends later this month 
the developments came during a crisis between prosyrian 
leftists moslem factions and rightwing christians over the 
election of a new president when the cabinet initially announced 
its resignation it accused gemayel of leaning too much toward 
israel 
parliament failed aug 18 to muster the needed quorum of 51 
members to elect a president syrianbacked warlord suleiman 
franjieh 78 was the only serious contender 
franjiehs backers have accused the rightwing christian 
lebanese forces militia of forcefully preventing deputies from 
attending the parliamentary session 
the lebanese forces denied the charge and said the boycotters 
opposed franjiehs candidacy 
a lebanese forces spokesman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity has said there will be no quorum as long as franjieh 
remains a candidate 
parliament speaker hussein husseini a shiite moslem adjourned 
the aug 18 session without setting the date for a new meeting to 
elect a head of state 
the independent daily paper annahar said gemayel would form an 
interim cabinet headed by a maronite catholic if no president was 
elected by sept 23 when his sixyear term expires 
hoss move also appeared designed to block such an attempt by 
gemayel 
according to an unwritten national covenant dating to lebanons 
independence from france in 1943 the president should be a 
christian the prime minister a sunni and the house speaker a 
shiite moslem 
the formation of a new cabinet in the present critical 
political situation would lead to risky consequences hoss said 
in his letter to gemayel 
he said the formation of a cabinet headed by a maronite prime 
minister would derail the presidential elections 
lebanons syrianbacked moslem and leftist factions also have 
told gemayel not to form a christianheaded cabinet it said such a 
move would rekindle the 13yearold civil war which has claimed 
more than 130000 lives 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon it maintains 40000 
troops in eastern and northern provinces as well as west and south

lawmakers early friday finished work on 
a new constitution that replaces the authoritarian charter drawn up 
two decades ago by military generals 
the new constitution failed to make major social or economic 
changes such as land reform and curbing the role of the military 
but it legalizes strikes abolishes censorship strengthens 
indians rights and environmental laws and lowers the voting age 
brazil is a new country this constitution will protect the 
weak and punish those who abuse power the constituent assemblys 
speaker ulysses guimaraes said 
the lawmakers completed the document shortly before 2 am they 
had begun work in february 1987 two years after civilian rule 
returned to brazil after 23 years under the military 
no further action is required for adoption of the constitution 
the document has been sent to proofreaders and it will become 
effective sept 23 
the 245article constitution covers nearly every aspect of daily 
life interest rates education health divorce indians rights 
strikes and minimum wages 
a first draft had reduced the militarys role to basic keepers 
of the peace but rumblings from the stillpowerful 
behindthescenes generals promoted the armed forces to 
defenders against foreign or national threats the nationwide 
democratic ruralist union lobbied hard against land reform its 
leader powerful landowner and chiropractor ronaldo caiado 
convinced thousands of farmers and rural workers that the 
constitution would expropriate productive land 
bowing to pressure legislators excluded productive land from 
land reform unless it produces marijuana 
in a country where farms are the size of nations and 4 percent 
of the 143 million people own more than half the fertile land very 
little land is expected to go to brazils 12 million landless 
peasants under the constitution 
president jose sarney who came to power in 1985 in an indirect 
electoral college election ardently fought against a parliamentary 
system of government and won a fiveyear term in office instead of 
four brazilians havent voted for president since 1960 and most 
polls showed they wanted sarney a provincial politician closely 
linked to the military out of office this year 
brazilians will vote for a new leader in november 1989 
new envirnonmental laws are aimed at protecting brazils amazon 
rainforest randomly burned by the landless and speculators 
indians also gained new rights including exclusive use of 
their land and resources 
the constitution also 
lowers the voting age from 18 to 16 years of age the only 
other country where 16 year olds can vote is nicaragua 
legalizes strikes for all workers before essential 
sectors of the labor force were not allowed to strike 
nationalizes mineral mining and gives foreign companies four 
years to hand over control to a brazilian resident 
bans new oil risk contracts 
abolishes censorship of films books and television 
abolishes the decree law a powerful tool used by the 
president to bypass congress and push through legislation 
gives women 120day maternity leaves and men fiveday 
paternity leaves 
the question brazilians now must wrestle with is how to 
implement the constitution in a country with rampant corruption 
runaway inflation and vast economic and social inequality 
in 1993 brazilians will vote on whether they prefer a monarch 
prime minister or president to run the country

a judge friday sentenced four polygamist 
clan members to minimum prison terms enraging prosecutors who said 
the penalties for a church bombing and fatal police standoff were 
too lenient and possibly illegal 
chief us district judge bruce jenkins amid repeated 
criticisms of federal mandatory sentencing standards governing 
bombings and firearms said he had no choice but to order prison 
terms of 15 years for clan ringleader addam swapp and five years 
for his motherinlaw vickie singer 
the sentence imposed is not for what you say not for what you 
believe but for what you did jenkins told swapp who was 
seriously wounded in the jan 28 shootout with fbi agents that 
ended one of utahs most bizarre churchstate confrontations a 
state corrections officer was killed 
swapps brother jonathan swapp and mrs singers son john 
timothy singer both 21 each received mandatory 10year sentences 
for a pair of firearms charges and five years probation for two 
other counts prosecutors said the maximum penalty for the four 
counts was 45 years 
they said addam swapp could have been imprisoned for 75 years 
and mrs singer for 50 years for their parts in the jan 16 bombing 
of a mormon chapel in marion and a 13day siege of their rural 
stronghold by 100 officers 
i think once again that everyone involved in this whole 
process continues to wonder why it ever occurred jenkins told 
mrs singer 45 who tearfully implored the judge to free her 
jenkins said mandatory sentencing laws imposed by congress 
illustrate a crisis of the whole sentencing process whether 
we judge without knowing anything about the case as a matter of 
social policy 
the sentences and jenkins criticisms of congress infuriated 
us attorney brent ward he said prosecutors planned to appeal the 
sentences as illegal since jenkins simply declined to impose 
penalties on some counts and rendered lessthanminimum terms on 
others 
ive heard stronger sentencing comments in a drunkdriving 
case ward said adding he had never been involved in a case 
where the sentence was given with apologies to the defendant and 
criticism of the congress 
theres no case i know of that more clearly shows the wisdom 
of congress in imposing minimum sentences ward said 
state murder charges in the shooting death of state corrections 
lt fred house killed in the shootout were expected to be filed 
tuesday against an unspecified number of the 15member clan that 
included nine children under age 18 
swapp said the bombing was ordered by god as a sign of the 
impending collapse of the mormon church and all government and

wave of labor unrest began 18 days ago polands prime minister 
made a similar mission to a nearby mine 
in szczecin 1800 dockworkers and 600 bus depot workers offered 
to end their strike as soon as job security is guaranteed for the 
bus workers said interfactory strike committee member artur 
balasz he said strikers idled since aug 17 were awaiting 
managements response 
the end of the szczecin strikes would leave the july manifesto 
mine in jastrzebie in southwestern poland the only facility in the 
country still on strike workers there left their jobs on aug 16

in exchange for a government promise to begin national talks on 
legalizing the trade union solidarity 
walesas talks with strikers at the mine continued past 
midnight a polish journalist who asked not to be identified said 
there was progress in the negotiations and added everybody is 
waiting for a happy finale 
prime minister zbigniew messner turned up unannounced at the 
neighboring borynia coal mine to discuss workers concerns polish 
media said the mine within sight of july manifesto went on 
strike from aug 2024 and labor tensions have persisted there 
walesa began talking to strikers at the july manifesto mine 
immediately after arriving in the morning with an aide and his 
parish priest rev henryk jankowski said management spokesman 
antoni pilny he also spoke at a rally with workers in the 
afternoon 
pilny later said the strikers were resisting going back to work 
until local issues were settled he said outstanding issues 
included guaranteeing strikers job security raising pay 
improving working conditions and reinstating fired solidarity 
activists 
the two sides are still locked in debate over the guarantees 
of strikers personal safety pilny said he said he expected a 
guarantee to be issued by the police chief and prosecutor

dabrowski in warsaw promising that the church would defend the 
personal and job safety of miners who ended their strikes pilny 
said 
a man answering the phone in the mine management building who 
demanded anonymity said the miners initially refused walesas

management told about 400 involved in the strike action not to 
return to their jobs gdansk solidarity spokesman bogdan borusewicz 
said 
management told the workers to file applications for 
reinstatement but most of them went back to work the spokesman 
said 
strike committee leaders were negotiating with port authorities 
to secure formal reinstatement no agreement had been reached he 
said

years 
in the meeting walesas first with with ranking officials in 
six years the government agreed to discuss legalizing the 
outlawed solidarity trade union movement and other worker issues in

the communist authorities recognized solidarity in an agreement 
signed aug 31 1980 but declared martial law in december 1981 to 
suppress the first independent union in the soviet bloc solidarity 
was outlawed in 1982 
government spokesman jerzy urban praised walesas efforts to end 
the labor unrest we appreciate any positive and reasonable step 
the appeal to stop the strike is such a step it should be 
especially valued when it comes from a participant in the 
strikes urban said

an organization for fat people rallied friday 
for an end to job discrimination against the obese saying dieting 
is not the answer to the problems they face in the workplace 
members of the national association to aid fat americans say 
most workers who are overweight have been or will be refused jobs 
promotions or health insurance benefits because of their size 
should we follow the national institutes of healths obesity 
panel which says slim down no thats not the answer said 
member rosezella cantyletsome should we lobby to make weighty 
people a constitutionally protected category yes 
the group is holding a convention in baltimore through monday 
and sponsored the rally attended by about 100 people the 
organization founded in 1969 and based in herald calif says it 
is a human rights organization dedicated to improving the quality 
of life for fat people 
youre not at a fat peoples rally youre at a civil rights 
rally said russell williams cochairman of the groups activism 
committee 
harry gossett author of fat chance a book on 
discrimination against overweight people borrowed from the i 
have a dream speech delivered by the rev martin luther king jr 
in washington 25 years ago 
we have a similar dream for people to be judged by their 
ability and not by their attraction to gravity he said 
comparing prejudice against overweight americans to 
discrimination against blacks gossett said today fat people 
are assumed to be inherently ugly unsanitary stupid lazy and 
enslaved by creature comforts 
the groups president nancy summer said surveys show that 85 
percent of women weighing about 200 pounds or more reported 
employment discrimination because of their size a high percentage 
of fat women who have jobs told researchers they feel they are 
overqualified for the tasks they are assigned she said 
obese workers are frequently hidden in back offices and given 
work that keeps them away from the public and many are told they 
cannot be hired because fat people take too much sick leave and 
drive up insurance rates ms cantyletsome said

a federal judge friday reimposed potentially 
bankrupting fines against yonkers for defying a courtordered 
housing desegregation plan then unsuccessfully tried to reach a 
settlement in informal discussions 
us district judge leonard sand who found the city guilty of 
racially segregating housing for 40 years reinstated the fines 
which were upheld by the us supreme court on thursday night 
sand said the supreme court decision does not alleviate in any 
way indeed one might agree it intensifies the fiscal crisis that 
confronts the city of yonkers 
he added that although the nations highest court blocked fines 
and jail terms for four defiant city councilmen they the 
councilmen still have a responsibility to the citizens they 
represent who will bear the brunt of these fines 
because monday labor day is a court holiday sand ordered the 
city to pay 192000 on tuesday as previously promised by sand 
more than 85000 of the money due will be earmarked for yonkers 
public schools and to guarantee the payment of interest on city 
bonds the balance of the 192000 will go to the us treasury and 
is nonrefundable 
sand then called on lawyers for all parties to immediately meet 
with him privately to explore informally some ideas we have for a 
possible solution of this crisis the talks ended after about an 
hour 
it was not successful mayor nicholas wasicsko told 
reporters 
michael sussman attorney for the national association for the 
advancement of colored people said there was no progress and 
called it a hostile discussion 
i havent changed my position i will do what i have to do 
said henry spallone one of the councilman opposed to the 
desegregation plan 
on aug 1 the council voted 43 against incentives to build 800 
units of middleincome housing throughout the city as part of the 
desegregation plan ordered by sand 
the fine had started at 100 on aug 2 and doubled daily until 
it was stopped after a week pending appeals the city has paid 
12700 and was to resume paying at 12800 on friday until the 
fine reaches 1 million a day and stays there growing in 
milliondollar jumps 
gov mario cuomo said he would direct the citys emergency 
financial control board on tuesday to begin making the substantial 
reductions in city spending and services that will be required by 
sands order 
the control board which assumed management of yonkers finances 
aug 9 passed a resolution the same day saying it would seek the 
criminal charges against the four councilmen if the fines were 
reinstated the charges stem from violating the control board act 
a state law by jeopardizing the citys fiscal condition 
cuomo said last week he would initiate removal proceedings 
against the four councilmen if the fines were reimposed 
however cuomo spokesman gary fryer said friday that for the 
time being the governor would not attempt to oust the recalcitrant 
councilmen 
the high courts ruling was raising more questions about 
removal than already existed and there were already many 
questions fryer said 
the supreme court ruled late thursday night to stay a lower 
court ruling that upheld contempt citations against the four 
councilmen who had been paying 500aday fines and would have 
been subject to imprisonment this weekend 
the court has granted the stay for the four council members 
until they have had time to ask the court formally to fully review 
their cases us supreme court spokeswoman toni house said 
thursday night 
the application so far as the city of yonkers is concerned has 
been denied she said 
even with the 1 million daily fine cap yonkers the states 
fourthlargest city with a population of 200000 people just north 
of new york city would be bankrupt by november officials said 
house said the entire court considered the applications and 
justices thurgood marshall and william brennan filed a 12page 
dissent 
as the city repeatedly points out in its application yonkers 
is relatively unique in that most of the governmental power in the 
city is centralized in the legislative branch for this reason the 
city is the council marshall wrote in arguing that all the stays 
be denied 
wasicsko who favors complying with sands housing desegregation 
order said the decision troubled him 
the treasury of the city is going to be exposed and the 
taxpayers of the city are going to feel the burden he said 
one thing it denies is the political martyrdom of the councilmen 
they were slated to go to jail on sunday their personal fines have 
ceased but the city is going to plummet to bankruptcy so their 
onus is their duty to the city 
two of the four nicholas longo and vice mayor henry spallone 
called the decision a great victory 
but councilman peter chema another of the four called the 
decision a big personal victory but i have serious concerns 
about the city 
its kind of like being administered oxygen while someone 
strangles you said chema 
the relief becomes moot if he decides to bankrupt the city in 
the interim longo said 
the fourth councilman edward fagan called the decision 
unexpected and declined to comment further

us ambassador clyde taylor on friday 
finished his threeyear assignment here during which he was accused 
of meddling in paragays internal affairs and was once teargassed 
at a garden party 
before boarding the plane taylor acknowleged having contacts 
with people and organizations gen alfredo stroessners government 
considers subversive but added we never aligned ourselves with 
any group 
he said the goal of us policy is that paraguay continue 
being a stable country thinking of the future five or 20 
years after stroessner is to think of a transition with someone 
who knows how to promote development and democracy and justice 
without violence 
stroessner 75 seized power in 1954 and has ruled this 
landlocked south american nation since with the support of the army 
and the colorado party 
taylors replacement timothy towell is to arrive next week in 
asuncion 
the departing ambassador told foreign reporters when i got 
here it was taboo to talk of anyone replacing the president now 
everything has changed president stroessner like all of us is a 
little older and i see it as a good step that he himself talks 
about his succession 
relations between taylor and the generals authoritarian 
government became uneasy soon after the ambassador arrived in 
november 1985 the 50yearold career diplomat whose parents were 
calvinist missionaries traveled through the country advocating 
human rights and meeting with opposition groups 
he pressed for the reopening of abc color paraguays biggest 
newspaper which was closed in 1984 for printing articles the 
government considered subversive 
taylor also had asked the government to track down the source of 
a signal that jammed broadcasts by radio nanduti the countrys 
most popular station before it was forced off the air 
allegations about his conduct ranged from interfering in 
domestic politics to conspiracy and subversion interior minister 
sabino montanaro said last year taylor was close to being declared 
persona non grata 
police fired tear gas at a garden party given in his honor in 
february 1987 but taylor continued to press for human rights and 
speak his mind including a hint in february 1988 that government 
officials might be involved in drug trafficking

a judge friday reversed her order that a teenage 
mother who left her two sons alone in a sweltering apartment for 
three days practice birth control throughout her childbearing 
years saying it was unenforceable 
maricopa county superior court judge lindsay budzyn had 
sentenced debra ann forster on may 24 to lifetime probation with 
the birthcontrol stipulation 
at a hearing earlier in the week ms budzyn refused to revoke 
the probation even though she learned that mrs forster 18 is 
pregnant with her fourth child she said mrs forsters pregnancy 
didnt mean that the courts orders had been ignored since no 
method of birth control is foolproof 
mrs forster pleaded guilty in april to two counts of attempted 
child abuse stemming from a may 1987 incident in which she left her 
two sons william 1 and scott 6 months alone in a mesa 
apartment for three days authorities said the apartment had no air 
conditioning and both babies were dehydrated and near death when 
found 
the judge said at forsters sentencing that the birth control 
stipulation was the only way to make sure mrs forster did not have 
other children to abuse 
ms budzyns ruling friday came on motions filed by defense 
attorney garrett simpson mrs forsters public defender and 
attorney colin f campbell representing the arizona civil 
liberties union to modify the terms of probation by deleting the 
birthcontrol requirement 
campbell argued that the order was invasive amounted to cruel 
and unusual punishment and violated freedom of religion for mrs 
forster a roman catholic 
in her ruling friday ms budzyn wrote the birthcontrol 
requirement was being lifted because of its inability to be 
enforced 
instead the judge ordered that mrs forster undergo urinalysis 
testing for drugs every two weeks enroll in a comprehensive 
counseling program including individual counseling and classes in 
parenting skills prenatal care and birth control receive marriage 
counseling and have a complete assessment of her medical condition 
at the time of the delivery of her child 
while awaiting trial this year mrs forster gave up the rights 
to her sons and a daughter who was born in jail according to court 
records all three have been adopted

the bankruptcy trustee for the ptl 
religious complex said friday hes very very skeptical about 
whether founder jim bakker will come up with the cash to back up 
his 165 million offer for the ministry 
mc red benton told the associated press in a telephone 
interview from his winstonsalem nc home that he thinks the 
former television evangelist does have a financial commitment from 
28 greek businessmen who are supposed to be backing the deal 
bakker has not identified those businessmen even to benton 
but he said bakker seems to be having some trouble getting the 
cash into the united states benton had said thursday that he 
expected bakker who founded the television ministry and theme park 
but then left after admitting to extramarital sex to sign a 
contract to buy ptl on friday morning 
but the money was not available and legal details were not yet 
worked out so benton extended the deadline until tuesday morning 
bakker lawyer ryan hovis of rock hill who met with ptl 
bankruptcy lawyers friday at ptls heritage usa park said there 
were no serious snags in the negotiations and that a 3 million 
letter of credit to back up bakkers offer would be available by 
tuesday 
hovis said the reason the contract wasnt signed friday morning 
as previously announced is that a lot of legal details must be 
taken care of for such a large purchase 
ptl lawyers who met with hovis on friday declined comment on the 
negotiations 
benton said if the money isnt available by tuesday hell be 
forced to consider other bids for the ministrys assets he said 
offers of 120 million 125 million and one ranging from 150 
million to 200 million have been made as well as canadian real 
estate executive peter thomas standing offer of 113 million he 
declined to elaborate 
benton has a deadline of sept 10 to recommend a buyer to us 
bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds 
we cant present anything to the judge if we do not have full 
and complete assurance that he bakker can fulfill the 
commitment benton said i am very very skeptical about 
whether hell come up with the money 
reynolds has not indicated when he will choose a buyer for ptl 
but he has said during court hearings that hes anxious to pay 
creditors and to keep heritage usa operating 
any involved parties could appeal reynolds choice of a buyer to 
us district court 
benton said his job is to secure the deal that will pay the most 
money to creditors not to determine bakkers chances of success 
benton said if bakker does come up with the cash and secures the 
deal he thinks things will be different this time around 
i think he would have a financial watchdog to keep him out of 
trouble he said i really think hes learned his lesson 
bakker told the charlotte nc observer on thursday that hes 
confident his new ministry new covenant partners inc will 
succeed 
i see it as a chance to do some of the things better where 
ive made mistakes and wrong decisions bakker said there will 
strict financial controls to make sure ptl lives within its 
budget

most alligator hunters were disappointed 
after the first day of floridas monthlong gator season but by 
friday morning some lucky ones bagged animals as long as nine feet 
thursday at sunset marked the beginning of the first legal 
alligator hunt in 26 years for the lucky or notsolucky 230 
people granted permits to catch the reptiles with harpoons nooses 
crossbows and almost anything but a gun 
the first night of the 30day hunt netted about 130 alligators 
in 28 designated hunting areas across the state according to the 
florida game and fresh water fish commission thirtyeight were 
bagged in the everglades while 36 were taken in the lake 
okeechobee area a spokesman said 
two novice hunters david and jerry navin snaked through a dade 
county canal in the darkness looking for the redreflecting eyes 
that give away the swimming reptiles but the gators refused to 
cooperate 
theres a few here but theyre not really doing what theyre 
supposed to chuckled david navin theyre a little tougher 
than we thought 
his brother jerry called their experience onthejob 
training 
to the north on lake okeechobee one of the designated hunting 
areas some gator pursuers reported better luck 
thomas alpern 25 of brooklyn ny the only northerner 
receiving a permit bagged a ninefooter despite worrying 
beforehand that he might be unable to kill the animal even when he 
captured it 
with gator hides selling for 42 a foot and meat running up to 
6 a pound alpern and others persevered though few expected to 
bag their 15gator limit the first night 
hide and meat sales from a single alligator can total 300 to 
500 
were having fun said bud wolfe an alligator hunter from 
oakland park where else but in africa can you go after a 
500pound animal that can kill you 
early success came to carlos donate of miami and his guide jay 
medore of clewiston they snagged a 8foot3inch animal only 80 
minutes after they started hunting on lake okeechobee 
once they got the gator reeled up to the side of the boat they 
shot it with a bang stick a firearmlike gadget that is 
allowed under the game commission rules 
we blew one hell of a hole in his head donate said it 
was exciting 
he then taped the gators mouth shut 
its scary putting that tape on his mouth even with a hole in 
his head he said 
doug mackie and steve prater who work for the city of pembroke 
pines utilities department bagged a 6foot alligator and another 
that was 8 feet or longer 
prater showed how he hooked one just beside the alligators left 
rear leg with a large hook on a heavyduty saltwater fishing rod 
he said fighting the gator when it was hooked was very difficult 
and he snapped the heavy fiberglass rod 
it was a deepsea rod and it just plain snapped in two he 
marveled 
alligator hunting was outlawed in florida in 1962 because 
wildlife biologists feared overhunting of the ancient reptiles 
might threaten the survival of the alligator 
a small alligator industry has built up in recent years because 
alligators have increasingly become problems by turning up in urban 
areas and pestering and occasionally killing humans or their pets 
estimates place the current number of alligators living in 
florida at 1 million and game commission officials said they are 
now far from an endangered species

friday that iraq had used chemical weapons in a military campaign 
against kurdish villages that has left hundreds of civilians dead

deliberate policy of killing kurds 
the reports were among many recent accusations of iraqi 
atrocities against kurds who are fighting for an independent 
homeland in northern iraq 
the iraqi news agency quoted an official source as denying 
chemical weapons were used in northern iraq the source identified 
the kurds who are fleeing into turkey and iran as traitors who 
collaborated with the iranian invaders during the eightyear 
persian gulf war 
iraq launched a major offensive against the rebels after 
accepting a unsponsored ceasefire in the war last month 
both the turkish and iranian governments have reported the 
arrival of thousands of kurds in turkey premier turgut ozal said 
thursday that 60000 refugees had arrived since the country opened 
its borders two weeks ago

distinguishable by its garliclike smell

northern iraq said they walked north for three days to reach the 
turkish border after the iraqi army launched an offensive heavily 
bombing their settlements in the last week of august

500 people from our original group of 10000 died before reaching 
the turkish border said aziz taha 25 a university student who

democratic nominee michael dukakis jibed 
at both men on the republican ticket friday labeling george bush a 
dropout on education and ridiculing the idea of dan quayle leading 
the war against drugs 
speaking to an enthusiastic flagwaving crowd dukakis asked 
is there anybody here today is there any citizen in the united 
states of america who thinks that dan quayle is qualified to be 
the nations drug czar 
the crowd of 2000 to 3000 people in a public park erupted in 
hoots and cheers 
dressed in shirtsleeves on a bright sunny day in which the 
temperature headed toward 100 degrees the massachusetts governor 
noted that bush had said he was going to put his vice president in 
charge of the war against drugs 
ronald reagan tried that and it failed dukakis said 
he also stressed the schools issue a recurring theme of his 
speeches during a prelabor day campaign swing up the west coast 
the future will depend above all on the quality of education 
we provide dukakis said 
he accused the reagan administration of seeking to cut funds for 
remedial programs and teacher training while he had worked to 
bolster such programs in massachusetts 
then he asked what bush who says he wants to be known as the 
education president was doing at the time 
i guess he just dropped out dukakis said 
in spokane wash dukakis kept up his attack on quayle saying 
at a rally at a steelworkers union hall isnt it nice to have a 
democratic nominee for vice president whose qualifications have 
never been questioned by anybody 
the portland crowd which included some antiabortion 
demonstrators was one of the most enthusiastic to greet dukakis 
during the campaign and he had little trouble drawing partisan 
responses to his punch lines 
several times the crowd picked up the chant first heard at the 
democratic convention in atlanta of where was george a 
reference to democratic claims that bush tried to dissociate 
himself from such controversial reagan administration activities as 
arms sales to iran 
the crowd also loudly booed a reference to president reagans 
star wars plan for a spacebased missile defense system 
in another cut at quayle dukakis said that in a democratic 
administration were going to have a vice president whos been a 
leader in the united states senate 
in contrast to quayle a 41yearold senator from indiana 
dukakis running mate lloyd bentsen of texas is one of the 
senates senior members 
dukakis appeared in portland only hours after announcing that 
john sasso forced to resign a year ago as campaign manager would 
return with the title of vice chairman 
sasso left the campaign on sept 30 because of his involvement 
in distribution of a videotape demonstrating that sen joseph biden 
of delaware a dukakis rival for the democratic nomination had 
incorporated language by a british politician in his own speeches 
without giving credit 
dukakis was introduced at the rally by oregon gov neil 
goldschmidt who said dukakis has set the standard for every 
governor in the country 
as for the republican nominee goldschmidt said with george 
bush what you see is all that you get 
in spokane dukakis toured a kaiser aluminium co plant and gave 
his standard goodjobsatgoodwages stump speech at the union 
hall 
later at the airport asked again about sassos return dukakis 
replied he is a very talented person john didnt do 
anything that was illegal or dishonest it was a mistake in 
judgment

a navy officers courtmartial in the 
drowning of a rescueswimmer recruit proved that the recruits 
rights were violated regardless of the innocent verdict the 
victims family said friday 
a panel of four officers late thursday found lt thomas a 
torchia former officer in charge of the navy rescue swimmer 
school innocent on two derelictionofduty charges after a 
sevenday trial 
torchia was in charge of the school at pensacola naval air 
station on march 2 when airman recruit lee mirecki 19 of 
appleton wis died in a training pool after suffering a 
fearinduced heart attack 
witnesses testified that instructors threw mirecki into the pool 
and that one held his head under water after the panicstricken 
recruit climbed out and shouted that he wanted to dor or 
drop on request navy jargon for quitting the voluntary training 
my brothers rights to dor were totally violated without a 
doubt said his sister lynn johansen of appleton the law was 
broken according to the uniform code of military justice that 
comes out loud and clear 
mrs johansen and her husband larry sat through most of the 
trial mireckis mother elaine kitowski of manitowish waters 
wis and her husband mel kitowski also attended 
it is a very stressful thing for our family to be here mrs 
johansen said the verdict is not the most important thing for 
us 
most important she said is finding out how her brother died 
family members declined to express an opinion on the verdict but 
said they were satisfied with the prosecution of the case led by 
lt cmdr larry wynne 
mrs kitowski said she believed the courtmartial panel thought 
the defendants ignorance of what the instructors were doing to her 
son was insufficent reason to make him a criminal 
torchia testified he was on the telephone in his office 
overlooking the pool but neither heard nor saw anything to indicate 
something was wrong if present he said he would have stopped the 
instructors 
torchia 32 of princeton ill said he intended to continue 
his navy career as an aviation maintenance officer 
mireckis family is staying in pensacola for the courtmartial 
of a second defendant petty officer 2nd class michael w combe 
28 of tempe ariz 
combe an instructor is charged with involuntary manslaughter 
battery and conspiracy to commit battery charges he is accused of 
holding mireckis head under water 
a fivemember panel of officers was seated friday night to hear 
the case beginning tuesday also a motion to dismiss the charges 
was denied by the military judge who has handled both trials cmdr 
newell d krogmann made a similar ruling in the torchia case 
defense lawyer whf wiltshire of pensacola argued that vice 
adm nr thunman chief of naval education and training was 
unqualified to convene the courtmartial because there was an 
appearance he had a personal interest in the outcome of the case 
he contended thunmans interest stemmed from the adverse 
attention his command has received as a result of the death 
wynne argued against the motion saying that extending 
wiltshires theory up the chain of command would prohibit anyone 
including the chief of naval operations from convening a 
courtmartial in such a highvisibility case 
thunman testified wednesday that he had wanted to correct what 
he said were erroneous press reports that the navy failed to begin 
investigating the case until receiving outside pressure from the 
victims family their congressman and the media 
he also was concerned about initial reports released by navy 
spokesman who incorrectly said the death was from natural causes

whats in a name you ask at the 
edinburgh festival a lot 
with 913 shows on the unofficial festival fringe competing for 
theatergoers time and money participants found its the name of 
the event not necessarily the work itself that often is the thing 
if its an unknown play the name can make people look 
twice playwright eleanor zeal said of her show the tainted 
honey of homicidal bees just one of numerous fringe offerings 
whose title immediately catches the eye 
indeed visitors to the 42nd festival fringe which ended on 
sept 3 and which played alongside the scottish capitals 
higherprofile mainstream cultural binge are besieged by any 
number of suggestive punfilled or just plain odd titles chosen to 
make one event stand out from the next 
this years entries ranged from takeoffs on popular movies 
theres both a futile attraction and a fatal distraction 
based on the boxoffice hit fatal attraction as well as a 
jean de toilette based on the critically acclaimed jean de 
florette 
there also are shakespearean sendups such as not much of 
ado and jesus christ its julius caesar any title is 
permissible on the fringe as long as its not libelous 
trisha emblem the fringe assistant administrator defined a 
good title as one thats memorable even if its nothing witty 
she cited the life and times of hieronymus bosch as a title 
that was effective because of its distinctiveness 
sometimes people dont realize how distinctive their title is 
we didnt actually choose it to cause a stir said carolyn 
davies codirector of straight laced jo ortont jo shouldnt 
jo wouldnt jo couldnt jo didnt a satirical comedy that had 
this years longest name 
we all sat around and thought ok what are we going to call 
it and suddenly it arrived davies recalled aware that length 
has its disadvantages 
we couldnt fit the name on the tickets she said but 
its on all the posters and leaflets 
one playwright was worried his title was too distinctive 
i have a feeling a lot of people are going to say its 
strident simon harries said of the title to his show hold your 
horses mussolini a comedy with music and dancing about one king 
zog of albania 
but harries a 36 yearold marketing director who last wrote a 
fringe play 10 years ago stood by his choice its honest it 
really does say what you need to know about the play its 
immediately arresting and surprising 
and what if the titles good but the play itself isnt all 
agreed that theres the rub 
there has to be something behind a title an interesting 
concept in the play itself said trisha emblem 
speaking by telephone from his office in london simon harries 
said i shall be there in edinburgh every day talking to 
people to find out why they came to see my show

having made films about political 
violence on three continents greekborn filmmaker costagavras now 
turns his attention to racial terrorism in the united states 
the movie is betrayed in which debra winger portrays an 
undercover fbi agent who becomes the lover of tom berenger a 
midwest farmer who leads a paramilitary white supremacy sect the 
story begins with the murder of a controversial radio talkshow 
host and includes the robbing of banks to finance the movement 
once again a costagavras film has paralleled news events his 
most famous films portrayed us involvement in the overthrow of 
chiles military regime missing and military despotism in 
greece z he has also dealt with torture in latin america in 
state of siege eastern europe stalinism in the confession 
and the palestinian issue in israel with hanna k 
costagavras who has lived in france for many years is no 
stranger to controversy he recently talked with accustomed 
frankness about his work and politics during a visit to california 
for the hollywood opening of betrayed 
q is there something unique about racism in the united states 
a here its different the expression of racism is probably 
much more violent the ideology of racism is the same everywhere 
unfortunately 
q did you do a lot of research for betrayed 
a yes the moment i started to do the movie which means three 
years ago i started doing research in the different fields you 
find everything in television or in books or in newspaper 
interviews its extraordinary everything is there i saw hours of 
tapes 
a lot of things happened during and after my research howard 
beach happened while i was researching then the bernhard goetz 
story all those things are extraordinary i think the last 1015 
years is a kind of wave of racism 
costagavras was referring to a dec 20 1986 incident in the 
howard beach section of queens ny in which a group of young 
whites beat and chased some blacks resulting in the death of one 
black goetz who is white was convicted in june 1987 of a weapons 
violation in the new york subway shooting of four black youths he 
said he thought were going to rob him 
q do you think racism has become more prevalent than before 
a yes i think so i do not know the reasons i try to 
understand why i think it always was there somehow but people 
feel authorized to express themselves much more openly 
q the most shocking scene in betrayed is when the farmers 
armed with automatic guns stage a kind of nighttime foxhunt of a 
young black do you think that could happen in this country 
a no i dont have any direct evidence that it happened what 
im trying to do there is make the scene as strong as possible 
just to show how unbearable how frightening can be racist murder 
i dont see much difference between killing a man on the street 
because he is black or has a different religion or hunting him i 
tried to dramatize how unacceptable that can be 
q why did you choose debra winger 
a debra has the quality of being a strong person as a character 
and an excellent actress she also has a very personal involvement 
in what is going on in the world those three elements are 
essential for someone to play that kind of role 
q and tom berenger 
a i like toms cowboy style handsome and clean he has that 
kind of face and then its like the moon he has a dark side all 
of us have our dark side the important thing is how far we go with 
our dark side 
q as an outsider do you think you have a better view of 
america 
a maybe not better different surely because i have so much 
curiosity about your society everything that happens here has a 
direct effect on where we are coming from the smaller countries of 
europe socially and artistically 
we have a curiosity and also a tenderness about your country 
because you have given us some many things movies theater 
literature music these things we grew up on 
q your films always seem to have political overtones is this 
because of your particular psyche 
a i prefer to say ethical a more hopeful view but if we 
say political i think all movies contain political meaning 
every movie reflects the philosophy or the ethics of its 
authors mine are no exception 
q do you deplore that outpouring of mindless violence and silly 
comedies that pour forth from the studios especially in the 
summertime

the infant gingerly reaches for ed bellings 
mustache their eyes meet and a big baby grin spreads across the 
2montholds face 
the boys teenage parents homeless and drug addicted arent 
there to capture the moment but belling is 
he is one of a growing number of 60minute dads and moms they 
give their time and love to help cuddle and care for the citys 
small army of boarder babies infants forced to live in sterile 
hospital settings 
looking around the crowded nursery at st lukes hospital in 
manhattan belling an unmarried boxoffice clerk prefers to dwell 
on the positive what ive done is given a tiny baby some 
nourishment some comfort even if it is only for an hour 
the babies wind up in hospitals for various reasons some have 
been abandoned or have parents who cant afford to take care of 
them most have parents who arent fit to take care of them 
usually addicts says anne ormsby of the citys human resources 
administration which oversees the boarder baby program 
there are about 300 such infants in the city most of them black 
or hispanic children who at one point spent as much as three 
months lying in steelsided cribs and plastic bassinets waiting to 
be put in foster homes 
reforms in the system have since helped reduce that wait to an 
average of five days for healthy infants but those with special 
needs can stay as long as eight months says carolyn yordan of the 
greater new york hospital association which represents 70 
hospitals 
boarder babies are fed and changed at regular intervals by 
already overburdened staff nurses 
but what about love 
thats where people like belling come in theyre part of st 
lukesroosevelt medical centers volunteer program to give the 
infants the human touch they crave 
nine women and eight men donate an hour each week to care for 
the hospitals boarder babies 
before the volunteers came up to hold the babies in the 
nursery the babies were not reactive to anything said virginia 
crosby director of volunteers at the medical center they would 
just lie there 
the staff would go in and feed them when they could the 
babies didnt even react to sound after a while 
once the volunteers started it was totally different ms 
crosby said they began to react to the love and you could see a 
real difference 
it was there in the face of the monthold boy loretta donato 
gently rocked in a dilapidated rocking chair inside st lukes 
boarder baby nursery a small graywalled room that would be 
cheerless if not for the efforts of the staff nurses who used their 
own money to decorate it 
eight tiny cribs actually miniature hospital beds their 
iron sides disguised with white paint and brightened with colorful 
mobiles dominate the room the desolate hospital walls are masked 
with a wallpaper border of skating bunnies 
the alice in wonderland curtains remind ms donato of the 
story of alices tumble down the rabbit hole and she tells it to 
the baby content in her lap 
across the room ian mccart who like belling is single 
expertly changes a 2weekold girls diaper 
mccart a manhattan banker who lives in westchester county went 
to the hospital 18 months ago to volunteer to help aids patients 
and met ms crosby 
one day she coaxed him into going upstairs to look at the 
babies i was hooked he said 
now every thursday after work he takes care of aids patients 
for an hour and then goes up to the nursery 
i just love to sit quietly with the child and play 
taperecorded classical music mccart said its the first 
peace i have all day long 
for mel heiko a 65yearold lawyer with two grown daughters and 
a 9monthold grandson the volunteer program is a second chance to 
experience fatherhood 
when his own children were young he said i was too busy 
trying to carve out a career 
sometimes you sit there and wonder whats going to happen to 
them said the 41yearold ms donato a married advertising 
executive who would like to have children but says nature has not 
been so kind 
i often sit there and create whole futures for them she 
said i like to think positive things maybe in some small way it 
will rub off 
the volunteers never know where the babies go once they leave 
i dont think i want to know to tell the truth said 
belling a couple of times ive seen the babies parents up 
there its scary 
i just think its better for us and better for the babies if 
we just spend that time with them make that little bit of 
difference

the last survivor of what many historians 
regard as the last massacre of indians in us history thinks 
returning to the site after more than seven decades may finally 
bring the scope of the tragedy home to her 
it would be strange because i feel like i stand off from all 
of it said mary jo estepp who was an 18monthold child when 
taken from her dead mothers back after the ambush in nevada in 
1911 its in the distance you know 
though she is now making plans for the visit with friends she 
lived most of her 78 or so years with only an outline of her past 
many details were finally supplied a few years ago by the author of 
a book about her grandfather an indian named shoshone mike who 
refused to live on a reservation 
the ambush by a white posse left mike and seven other indians 
dead in the snow near winnemucca nev on feb 26 1911 21 years 
after the last major indian massacre at wounded knee sd 
according to researchers shoshone mike refused to settle on the 
fort hall indian reservation in idaho and instead roamed the 
mountains near twin falls with his sons daughters and 
grandchildren 
the indians lived off the land and worked for farmers living in 
peace 
but in 1910 one of mikes sons was killed by a white horse 
thief and the family retaliated by killing the killer not 
trusting white justice shoshone mike took his family and fled into 
nevada 
the 12 indians survived a brutal winter by stealing cattle for 
food when four ranchers discovered the loss the indians killed 
them and took their horses 
posses from nevada and california pursued the indians for 300 
miles until feb 26 when they caught the ragged band sleeping and 
slaughtered four men two women and two boys during a brief battle 
one posse member was killed 
the four surviving children were put in the reno nev jail 
because there was no place else to put them 
in his 1973 book about shoshone mike titled the last free 
man author dayton hyde noted the four surviving children but he 
was unable to find out what happened to them 
a friend of ms estep contacted hyde after reading his book and 
hyde traveled to her home in yakima 
there is still much ms estep doesnt know about the time before 
she was lifted from that bloodsoaked cradleboard after falling 
facedown in the snow the identity of her father is unclear as is 
her age and whether she was born a shoshone or a bannock indian 
still she said they know my mother was one of shoshone 
mikes daughters her name was snake 
the massacre in nevada appears to have been the last of its kind 
in the united states said frank bergon a professor of native 
american cultures at vassar college in poughkeepsie ny whose 
novel shoshone mike was recently published by viking hyde 
agrees 
many massacres of whites and indians occurred in the 19th 
century what makes this significant is it occurred in 1911 when 
there were automobiles airplanes and movies bergon said the 
fact that it did occur in the 20th century makes the whole thing 
surreal 
after the massacre the federal government ordered evan estep 
then the superintendent of the fort hall indian reservation to 
pick up the children 
ms esteps memories begin with the train trip north in november 
1911 
i remember when we went to the dining car i wouldnt eat the 
food she said the exception was raisins in the raisin bread 
which tided her over they may have reminded her of food her family 
ate but she isnt sure 
the other three children died of illnesses within a year the 
toddler survived tuberculosis and was adopted by estep and his 
wife rita who were childless they guessed she was about 18 
months old when she was found 
she moved with the family to reservations in montana and new 
mexico finally settling at toppenish on the yakima indian 
reservation in 1924 
although her adoptive parents told her about the massacre she 
never asked for details and they never talked much about shoshone 
mike she said she was treated as a white person and noted most 
of my friends are nonindians 
the family moved to yakima in 1930 after estep retired ms 
estep still lives in the house purchased by her adoptive parents 
who died in the 1950s 
she graduated from central washington university with a music 
degree and spent 40 years teaching school before retiring in 1974 
she never married 
her only tangible link with her indian past is a single 
blackandwhite photograph of the four surviving children taken in 
front of the reno jail 
it shows the children she had thought were siblings until hyde 
identified them an aunt hattie age about 4 an uncle cleveland 
about 7 and another aunt heney who appears to be about 18 
and of course the haunting photo shows herself wearing a 
white hat and crying

if youre a 6foottall 13yearold who cant 
dribble a basketball one of your options is to crack wise 
for brad garrett now 6foot9 and the star of cbs first 
impressions making jokes to make up for two left feet became a 
successful career as a standup comedian 
now hes joined a growing legion of comics garry shandling 
paul reiser roseanne barr bob saget and dave coulier for 
instance who have made the transition from standup comedy to 
situation comedy 
its funny garrett said the transition a comedian has to 
make it seems from the standup to the acting is trusting the 
silence not getting that immediate reaction and being comfortable 
with that because were trained to be on the defense and always 
have something to say 
what garrett has to say often comes out in other peoples 
voices first impressions revolves around its stars ability to 
mimic everybody from bill cosby to hulk hogan garrett plays a 
voiceover actor in a small omaha ad agency hes also a single 
parent trying to raise a teenage daughter brandy gold 
first impressions was to have been a summer replacement 
series but the writers strike pushed it into a more important role 
as a quasifall series it premiered aug 27 and runs until oct 22 
the show is garretts second attempt at a sitcom he made a 
pilot a couple of years ago called super tomato 
it was about a grocery store he said yeah wonderful 
and i was a clerk i could send you a tape of that really whip 
your weekend into a frenzy i think 
before that garrett honed his standup skills eventually 
landing on the las vegas casino circuit he chatted at a restaurant 
in manhattan on a break as the opening act with the julio iglesias 
tour 
iglesias he said watched his act but didnt always get it 
since the spanish singer doesnt speak much english 
unless you do an impression of tito puente hes totally 
lost garrett noted 
the tour included 11 nights at radio city music hall not bad 
for a 28yearold comic its a dream to be able to walk out 
there without a flashlight garrett said 
garrett is pretty darn noticeable even in manhattan just by 
virtue of his height but he was sporting a large scraggly scar 
down the middle of his nose that would draw a second look even in 
this tough town he had fallen off iglesias tour bus on a stop in 
new jersey 
clumsiness is what propelled garrett into comedy he said he 
moved around a lot as a kid imagine the reaction of basketball 
coaches when he would arrive on the scene 
i wasnt a jock i mean i cant walk and talk i never 
had the moves jews dont dribble anyway its the heritage 
everytime id go to a new school they the coaches would say 
this is it this is the guy weve been waiting for and when id 
get on the court it was embarrassing so i got into theater 
getting into television was a little harder a matter of getting 
through the door literally the producers of first 
impressions were so impressed by their 6foot9 find they 
constructed a special set to tone down the impact of his height on 
screen 
they had to make the set like 3 inches taller enlarge the 
doors and the countertops and the chairs garrett said the 
elephant man set i call it 
first impressions airs saturdays at 8 pm edt

the big whew from the stock market last 
friday came from evidence that inflationary pressures and 
therefore interest rate increases might possibly be easing 
as has happened a hundred times in the past wall street once 
again is mesmerized by inflation and interestrate possibilities 
and it reacts almost instantly to any news on the subject 
a high or rising level of interest rates is of special 
importance to the stock market for at least two reasons 
first it is generally agreed that the stock market collapse of 
last october was triggered at least in part by rates rising to 
levels that made debt securities more rewarding than stocks 
next high or rising interest rates become an important factor 
in the cost of doing business as well as a disincentive to market 
expansion at all levels from consumers to manufacturers 
another reason might be added the federal reserve board has 
been watching job figures for a clue to inflation strong job 
figures might convince it to raise rates a weaker job market would 
mean an easing of pressure 
after viewing the figures wall street concluded that the 
inflation threat might not be as bad as feared and that the fed 
would have less reason to push up interest rates 
but the the threat is not over and wall steet will continue to 
focus on borrowing costs and inflation wright investors service 
presents the case 
at current interestrate levels says wright which advises on 
billions of dollars of investment funds the possibility of new 
lows in stock prices lower than those of last october cannot be 
dismissed 
it points out that shortterm interest rates are now more than 1 
percentage point higher than they were one year ago at the stock 
market peak while longterm treasury yields are around onehalf 
percentage point higher 
in fact highquality corporate bonds offer a return nearly 2 
percentage points higher than that available on stocks a situation 
that is out of whack with recent history 
over the past 20 years stock earnings yields have averaged the 
same as longterm bond yields prior to 1984 says wright bond 
yields as high as todays would have precluded a stock 
priceearnings ratio of more than 10 
thus says wright the current stock market priceearnings 
multiple of 12 while only average for the postwar period may yet 
prove to be excessive in todays environment 
is the obsession with interest rates overdone does it ignore 
positive factors perhaps 
investor confidence could be supported by other aspects of the 
economy that show it to be stronger than a year ago despite its 
advanced age corporate earnings are setting records 
priceearnings ratios have shrunk corporate takeover activities 
continue to remove stock from the market thus creating a relative 
shortage of equities and investor psychology is much healthier 
a year ago you may recall investors floated on a cloud of 
euphoria and cared little for such fundamental considerations as 
real value now they fear the market they study fundamentals and 
they dont take chances 
wright agrees that these are indeed encouraging signs 
nevertheless wright and a host of other analysts wonder if those 
interest rates still might not knock prices down as they did last 
year 
so long as the threat exists says wright the bull market will 
have to wait when will it come you can be confident it 
concludes that a new bull market will get under way next year 
which means in effect that those interestrate worries will 
have abated

asians are keeping a close eye on an immigration 
debate in australia to see if it will mean a slow down in the flow 
of asian emigrants into the country 
some asians say they see signs of racism 
several asian newspapers have published editorials reminding 
australia of its growing economic links with asian countries 
the outcome of the intense immigration debate now under way in 
australia will either confirm or confound the view asians hold that 
a strong undercurrent of racism exists in the lucky country 
the conservative englishlanguage south china morning post of hong 
kong said 
while australia was founded on british values the facts today 
are that politically and economically the country cannot always 
look west 
in australia a growing influx of asian migrants is in the 
background of a debate over immigration rules and multiculturalism 
a policy that encourages migrants to keep cultural links with 
their homelands 
john howard leader of australias opposition liberal party 
says immigration from asia should be slowed in the interests of 
social harmony and that immigrants should embrace the 
englishspeaking majoritys anglosaxon cultural values 
i am not saying i would end asian immigration he said 
but what i am saying is that it is a legitimate concern of any 
community and any government to say that it is imposing social 
tensions and that it is imposing a lack of social cohesion 
the government has proposed legislation that would prohibit the 
use of race or ethnic origins as criteria for judging potential 
immigrants acceptability howard who heads a twoparty national 
opposition is against the bill but has lost support recently in 
parliament 
prime minister bob hawke of the labor party has vowed to fight 
any move to restrict asian immigration and says he would maintain a 
policy of nondiscrimination even if he thought it would mean 
losing an election 
australia a continent with only 16 million people near asias 
huge population of 3 billion is an attractive destination for 
emigrants it is called lucky because of its rich resources and 
comfortable climate 
the australian bureau of statistics says the number of asian 
immigrants climbed by onethird in the past year out of 116430 
immigrants between january and november 1987 47450 were asians 
compared with 36360 in the same period in 1986 australia has 
taken in 100000 vietnamese since 1975 when the indochina war 
ended and has a growing chinese community 
emigration counselors in several asian countries list australia 
as attractive for its climate proximity and educational 
opportunities for children increasing numbers of asians with 
capital and business experience are snowing interest in emigrating 
to australia 
in taiwan australia now surpassed canada and the united states 
as the top choice of emigrants 
people here barely knew anything about australia three years 
ago said david chang manager of taiwans queter international 
company which handles emigration applications to australia but 
emigrating to australia has become a fad now 
chang said he understood why australia had doubled the capital 
requirement for business emigrants to 500000 australian dollars 
410000 in the past year 
australia no longer needs foreign capital and personnel now as 
much as before it is only natural that it closes the door a bit 
in hong kong where emigration is on the upswing due to 
nervousness over chinas taking sovereignty of the british colony 
in 1997 australia is the second most popular destination after 
canada 
janet sekavs regional migration director in australias 
consulate in hong kong said 6431 filipinos emigrated to australia 
in 1986 compared with 5140 from hong kong and 5032 from malaysia 
chan kawai editor of the emigrant hong kongs magazine on 
emigration said he thought the number of emigration applications 
would remain high even if australia imposes new curbs 
australia is strange chan said it is in asia but it does 
not treat itself as an asian country it is a multiracial country 
and economically it should have the potential to accept more 
people 
susie tse migration service manager of price waterhouse 
emigration consultancy in hong kong said it would be racist if 
australia refuses asians but from my nine years experience in 
australia i have not felt any racism and am not sure if it is just 
overexaggeration by the press 
the fiercest reaction has come from a malaysian newspaper the 
star in kuala lumpur where editor vk chin wrote in a recent 
column that australians he described as racists make asian 
immigrants feel inadequate insecure and even subhuman 
based on the statements of some of these pillars of the 
australian political establishment it would appear that inside 
every liberal senator or member of parliament is a racist 
struggling to get out chin wrote 
australia may be a big wideopen country but it is in danger 
of being led by smallminded people with petty prejudices and 
attitudes more suited to the victorian age

only a few birds are chirping at 830 
am when the sounds of tchaikovskys piano concerto no 5 fill the 
woods of this northern michigan town 
the world youth symphony is rehearsing for an upcoming 
performance the music flows with deceiving precision one could be 
listening to a symphony orchestra not a collection of high school 
musicians at summer camp 
but this is anything but an ordinary summer camp 
this place is a paradox because the natural aspect is serene 
but serene is hardly the word to describe the activity here its 
crazy said ray wilkins chairman of the camps visual arts 
department 
the national music camp the 61st edition of which ended in 
august attracts 2100 campers from third grade through high 
school they come from all 50 states and 26 foreign countries to 
spend a summer of intensive study in music dance drama and the 
visual arts 
many campers already are accomplished in their chosen field 
they come to hone their skills at the camp which is spread over 
1200 acres and has about 450 buildings the camperstaff ratio is 
almost two to one and private lessons are available for those who 
want them 
these are bright kids and many of them are extremely 
wellequipped for a career in the arts said tom oosting 
director of the camps theater program 
with such a collection of talent competition among campers can 
get intense 
people come to the national music camp to see how they stack 
up said edward downing the camps director a lot of big 
decisions can be made during the summer as young people decide on a 
possible career in the arts 
perhaps the most intense competition occurs every friday when 
violinists in the world youth symphony challenge each other for the 
right to sit in the first chair the competition is known as 
bloody friday 
there are people who take it too seriously but competition 
has always been a part of being here downing said we like to 
think its friendly competition and we try to keep it that way 
its an opportunity for the camper to show how he or she has 
progressed not necessarily to beat the next person ahead of you 
despite the emphasis on the arts campers enjoy their free time 
like others their age many boys and girls like to find a secluded 
spot in the evening to talk quietly 
george wolff a high school student from warren mich said 
some campers like to play classical music but never would listen to 
it on their own its kind of humorous he said people will 
play mozart and beethoven then come back to their cabin and listen 
to a led zeppelin cassette 
the camps scenic location is a main reason youngsters get so 
much out of the program 
this place is absolutely conducive to clearing your mind and 
focusing on your work oosting said you need blue skies and 
varied visual stimuli 
the camp which was founded in 1927 also does its best to make 
sure the kids are kept busy campers in the theater department can 
be involved in up to three plays at one time 
however said oosting the theater program can be daunting 
rehearsal time is limited because the camps activities are 
structured in 50minute periods 
most gilbert and sullivan operettas are 2 hours long but are 
rehearsed and staged here in 50minute periods he said in 
most cases until the actual performance its probably never been 
run through from beginning to end 
campers belie their youth in terms of dedication to their 
specialty at night it is not unusual to hear the sounds of a 
violin or horn coming from cabins as campers practice on their own 
during the day the youth bustle from one class to the next 
walking quickly with a clear sense of purpose 
wolff said he would like to become an opera singer a career 
goal shared by few of his peers 
when i was 14 and listening to opera it was hard for some 
people to handle he said but i dont limit myself to 
listening to just opera i listen to all kinds of music 
the rules at the camp can be interpreted as strict all campers 
are required to wear a uniform blue corduroy pants for boys and 
knickers for girls and blue shirts for all campers from third 
through ninth grade are not allowed to leave the grounds during the 
eightweek session high schoolers are permitted to leave only with 
their parents or other preapproved adults 
yeah sometimes the rules get out of hand but its really 
trivial compared with what youre learning wolff said

the first reports from the control tower 
indicated the crash was nonsurvivable 
the boeing 727 skipped through a dry rockhard field off the 
end of a runway lost its right wing turned 90 degrees and caught 
fire 
there was a humongous fireball i didnt think anybody had 
made it said mary centron a toll booth worker who also 
witnessed the fiery crash of a delta air lines jumbo jet three 
years ago here 
yet one by one passengers crawled and clawed their way to 
daylight some through doors other through cracks in the aluminum 
shell of this delta jet flight 1141 of wednesday 
some helped mothers get their babies out the pilot pinned in 
the cockpit under a pile of debris kept telling passengers slow 
down watch your step 
somehow 95 survived one woman ran to a road and flagged down a 
ride back to the terminal another man said hes been hurt worse 
shaving just 24 hours after the crash 62 people had been treated 
at hospitals and released 
thirteen people died but experts and officials who specialize 
in dealing with disaster called the relatively low death toll a 
miracle 
i had expected fewer survivors said julia wells a parkland 
hospital emergencydisaster team nurse who arrived by helicopter 
when you see a plane that looks like that you dont expect that 
many to be walking around 
while the national transportation safety board evaluates the 
cause of flight 1141s disaster investigators say they also are 
studying why so many survived 
its a particularly important opportunity for accident 
investigators said us transportation secretary james burnley 
rescue workers credit their experience of the delta crash three 
years ago with preparing them for a fast efficient effort the 
ntsb had criticized the response to the crash of delta flight 191 
saying no coordinated effort was in place to handle the victims 
theres no comparison everything went so smoothly said 
texas department of public safety cpl bill taylor 
when we got here paramedic supervisor mike sympson said 
it was click click click 
and speed of evacuation whether through the work of rescue 
workers or the calm and capabilities of those on the plane may 
have been the key 
it appears we got a majority of the passengers out before the 
fire really set in said oris dunham executive director of the 
dallasfort worth international airport most of the fire 
occurred after the plane was evacuated 
those on board said somehow calm prevailed passengers waited 
in line to crawl through a hole in the fuselage and helped each 
other out smoke filled the cabin some crawled on the floor many 
could see the ominous orange flames of burning jet fuel 
it was kind of surprising said andy dyer a passenger who 
was on his way to help fight forest fires in montana there 
wasnt any screaming hardly at all it was real quiet i think 
everybody was aware of what was going on 
all but two who died were found in the rear of the aircraft 
many by an exit door that would not open in fact it took workers 
one hour thursday to jar the door loose 
the plane hit the ground at the tail investigators said fuel 
from the ruptured right wing is thought to have sprayed the rear 
and touched off the fire the right engine was found 100 feet away 
the cockpit section of the 727 broke open fire burned through the 
planes skin and melted the plastic windows 
yet the plane had come to rest without hitting any structures 
like two water tanks several hundred yards ahead it was a similar 
water tank that caused delta 191 to break up and explode 
investigators said that crash killed 137 people 
for those back in the delta terminal it seemed horrifyingly 
obvious what had happened a cloud of black smoke and eventually 
live television pictures of the charred carcass of an airplane had 
most including relatives of passengers assuming the worst 
my husband was on the plane joann waugh of dallas cried to 
a chaplain at the terminal 
later she sprinted for an exit racing to a nearby hospital 
where her husband penn was being treated for minor injuries 
im the luckiest person in the world she shouted as she 
ran god is so good

the nations largest general retailers were unable to break out 
of their 18month slump in august as weather conditions and 
continuing problems in apparel lines depressed sales for yet 
another month 
we were looking for a pickup that would hopefully continue 
through september and october fred wintzer a retail analyst for

oil futures prices have responded negatively to

delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude oil 
fell 10 cents per barrel to close at 1508 thursday other 
contract months also dropped

wholesale unleaded gasoline for october delivery rose 036 cent to 
finish at 4471 a gallon the september gasoline contract fell 149 
cents wednesday the last trading day before the contract expired 
contracts for other months mostly were lower 
wholesale heating oil for october rose 014 cent to 4346 cents 
a gallon while other contract months were mixed 
analysts said the strength in gasoline and heating oil prevented 
further declines in crude oil they attributed the recent gains in 
refined products to poor refinery economics outdated equipment 
for example has lowered refinery capacity keeping supply and 
demand nearly equal they said 
refining capacity has been pared down to the point where 
refiners are having problems just keeping up with day to day 
demand said jayne ball a commodity oil broker with dean witter

production quota set by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries 
in recent days oil futures prices weakened after reports that 
opecs 13 member nations were exceeding their collective quotas by 
more than 3 million barrels 
all this overproduction in a market where demand factors 
havent been substantial tends to be a price weakening factor and

international business machines corp has fired 
its longtime ad agency which created the memorable ad campaigns 
showing a charlie chaplinlike character making his chaotic 
business run smoothly with ibm products 
the computer giant ended a threemonth review of its advertising 
agencies by selecting lintasusa a unit of the interpublic group 
of companies and wells rich greene inc for its us advertising 
assignment 
the decision was the latest blow to its longtime agency lord 
geller federico einstein inc which is losing its biggest client 
and has been wracked by internal turmoil for much of the year 
ibm reportedly spends more than 100 million a year on 
advertising accounting for about half of lord gellers estimated 
200 million in billings 
lord geller which had competed to keep the account and expected 
to retain at least some of it has worked for ibm since 1979 
creating the chaplinesque ads and more recently a series of ibm 
ads reuniting the former stars of the television show mash 
lintas is best known for its cover girl diet coke and chevrolet 
ads while wells rich greene makes ads for ford motor co and 
benson amp hedges cigarettes 
we received shocking news this afternoon lord geller 
executives told the agencys employees in a memo ibm has decided 
to move its account to two large agencies 
william wardell lord geller president said he hopes the agency 
can win another computer account over the next few months while it 
continues to work through during a transitional period for ibm 
there has been no talk whatsoever about closing he said 
lord geller a unit of wpp group plc has been in turmoil since 
six of its top executives including chairman richard lord and 
president arthur einstein walked off the job on march 18 to form 
their own agency blaming interference from wpps management 
londonbased wpp group acquired lord geller along with the much 
larger j walter thompson ad agency in mid1987 when it bought jwt 
group 
the defectors eventually were joined by a number of lord geller 
employees including about 25 people who formerly worked on the ibm 
account 
the breakaway led to a contentious and unresolved court fight 
between wpp group and the new agency and its leaders 
in early june ibm said it would review its agency requirements 
and advertising direction and invited a limited number of agencies 
to compete for the assignment including both lord geller and the 
breakaway agency lord einstein oneill amp partners 
ibm spokeswoman theo chisholm said the company heard 
presentations from six agencies in addition to lord geller lord 
einstein and the two winners they were darcy masius benton amp 
bowles and grey advertising 
in announcing its decision ibm declined to say how much it 
spends on advertising or how that spending will be split between 
the agencies 
it said lintas will be responsible for ibm desktop products 
including the personal system2 line of personal computers while 
wells rich greene will do corporate advertising as well as 
marketing image advertising and solutions advertising programs 
at lord einstein chairman richard lord said he was disappointed 
but added we never expected any ibm business when we left 
there

the nations largest general retailers still are waiting for 
business to improve after continuing problems in apparel lines and 
unusually hot weather depressed sales again during august 
it is not encouraging as a harbinger of what backtoschool 
and fall is going to look like joseph ronning a retail industry 
analyst with the investment firm brown brothers harriman inc said 
after reviewing sales results announced thursday by storeowners 
some of the companies did worse in august than they did in 
june and july said fred wintzer an analyst with alex brown amp 
sons inc in baltimore 
several analysts blamed the august slump on the abnormally hot 
weather parts of the country suffered through last month 
jeffrey feiner an analyst with merrill lynch amp co said the 
underlying sluggish trend in consumer spending which began in 
february 1987 also remained in place 
retail sales have been a soft spot in an otherwise strong 
economy consumer spending which also includes outlays for food 
medical care autos utilities transportation and other 
necessities is closely watched because it accounts for twothirds 
of the gross national product 
some analysts dismissed the weather as a factor monroe 
greenstein of bear stearns amp co noted sales were disappointing 
on the west coast despite more normal temperatures there 
greenstein said women are still disenchanted with retailers 
fashion lines it was a year ago in august 1987 that apparel 
retailers fell into a slide as women refused to buy shorter skirts 
and clothes they perceived as boring 
a lot of retailers are pushing back their expectations for a 
good pickup in business until october greenstein said 
jeffrey edelman an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
said it was too early to get a good reading on how well the new 
apparel lines are faring but he said it appears as if some of 
the new fashion is better than it was last year 
edelman said some stores have reported a pickup in business this 
week those sales will be reflected in retailers september sales 
figures 
several companies recorded sales increases under 3 percent 
meaning the stores were losing ground to inflation which has run 
at an annual rate of 45 percent so far this year 
the nations largest retailer sears roebuck and co said its 
overall sales rose 63 percent from august 1987 levels and its 
sales for the first 30 weeks of the fiscal year increased 55 
percent from the same period a year earlier sales from sears 
stores open at least a year known in the trade as samestore 
sales were up 13 percent last month and 2 percent for the year 
to date 
retailers and industry analysts believe samestore sales are a 
more accurate yardstick of a companys performance than figures 
which include sales from new stores however not all retailers 
report both their overall and samestore results 
k mart said its sales rose 64 percent in august and 54 
percent for the year so far the retailers samestore sales rose 
22 percent for the month and 19 percent yeartodate 
walmart stores inc said its sales rose 24 percent overall last 
month and have risen 30 percent so far this year its samestore 
sales were up 8 percent in august and have risen 12 percent during 
the first seven months 
jc penney co inc suffered a 26 percent drop in overall 
sales last month while sales for the year so far were up 18 
percent samestore sales were down 34 percent last month while 
rising 07 percent for the year so far 
dayton hudson corp said its overall sales rose 15 percent last 
month and 173 percent yeartodate samestore sales rose 17 
percent in august and 15 percent for the first 30 weeks 
may department stores co had a 196 percent jump in overall 
sales in august while yeartodate sales improved 13 percent mays 
samestore sales were up 15 percent last month and 13 percent 
for the year so far 
fw woolworth co reported a 12 percent increase in august 
sales and an 119 percent rise for the first 30 weeks 
montgomery ward amp co said its august sales were up 47 percent 
while yeartodate sales rose 3 percent 
the results were from general merchandise and apparel retailers 
unlike monthly retail sales figures released by the federal 
government they do not include sales at auto dealers supermarkets 
or restaurants

a partial merger between the detroit news and 
detroit free press would mean trouble for the 25 other us cities 
that still have competing newspapers according to an arkansas 
newspaper 
the arkansas democrat of little rock filed a legal brief 
thursday supporting efforts to block a proposed joint operating 
agreement between the news owned by gannett co inc and the free 
press owned by knightridder inc 
the democrats main competitor is the arkansas gazette which is 
owned by gannett the nations largest newspaper chain gannett 
bought the gazette in 1986 the same year it acquired the news 
attorney general edwin meese iii approved the detroit joa on 
aug 8 shortly before leaving office court challenges followed 
and the partial merger was delayed at least until next week when 
it is to be reviewed by a federal judge in washington 
a decision approving the joa in this case would be a decision 
providing a blueprint for the elimination of competition in the 
remaining 25 cities with two newspapers the democrats attorneys 
said 
meeses decision in designating the free press a failing 
newspaper ignored evidence that the newspapers losses resulted 
from strategic decisions rather than market economics the brief 
said 
the democrat asked the court to rule that a newspaper is not 
failing when its losses are the result of predation 
the democrats brief said gannett operated both the news and the 
arkansas gazette at substantial losses in order to force smaller 
competitors to incur more painful losses 
gannetts strategy in acquiring the newspapers in detroit and 
little rock was not to operate either profitably in a competitive 
market but was instead to eliminate competition either by 
destroying its rival or by forcing its rival into a joint operating 
arrangement the brief said 
six days after meese approved the detroit agreement the gazette 
lowered subscription prices to 85 cents per week from 198 per 
week the brief said 
gannett spokeswoman sheila owens said the company would not 
comment immediately on the democrats allegations 
bill malone publisher of the arkansas gazette said the detroit 
agreement has nothing to do with us at all here at the gazette 
number one this price reduction was on the drawing board long 
before we knew anything about the outcome of the joa situation in 
detroit he said number two were not trying to put them out 
of business 
if you will look at the things we have done its just to 
match them free classifieds we matched them with free 
classifieds as far as circulation pricing all weve been doing is 
matching what theyve already been doing 
the detroit agreement would merge news and free press production 
and business operations while keeping separate the newspapers news 
and editorial departments profits and losses would be shared 
equally by the newspapers after the first five years of the 
100year agreement 
the newspapers sought exemption from federal antitrust laws 
under the newspaper preservation act which allows such partial 
mergers when one of the newspapers is declared in danger of failing

japan posted a current account surplus of 648 
billion in july down 11 percent from 728 billion a year earlier 
but up slightly from 643 billion in june the finance ministry 
said friday 
the current account is the broadest measure of trade and 
includes goods services and investment income plus various 
monetary transfers and aid payments 
the surplus in the trade of goods alone widened from the 
yearearlier level for the first time in 13 months going up to 
876 billion from 858 billion it also was up from a 738 
billion surplus registered in june 
the ministry said it is too early to conclude that japans 
downtrend in the trade surplus has come to a halt the july rise in 
the merchandise trade surplus had been reported in early august 
using a slightly different measure that made it the first such 
increase in 15 months 
the trade surplus the main target of criticism from the united 
states european countries and other major trade partners of japan 
had been declining consistently due to the yens sharp appreciation 
since 1985 a higher yen would restrain exports by making japanese 
goods less competitive abroad 
exports in july rose 168 percent over a year earlier to 228 
billion while imports surged 282 percent to a record 140 
billion 
ministry officials said exports of ships office automation 
equipment semiconductors television sets and cameras were strong 
exports also included parts and components that japanese companies 
shipped to their subsidiaries in other asian countries for 
assembly they said 
no breakdown of the trade surplus by countries or regions was 
given

two northrop corp shareholders have filed 
lawsuits against 38 current and former northrop officials and 
directors accusing them of illegal activities in connection with 
the aerospace companys major defense programs including the 
failed f20 tigershark jet fighter 
the suits filed thursday on behalf of northrop charge the 
defendants with breach of fiduciary duties and violations of 
various california statutes 
the lawsuits which also name northrop as a defendant seek the 
return of all salaries and other compensation paid the directors 
officers and outside consultants as well as unspecified damages to 
be paid to northrop 
the company has denied any impropriety 
the suits filed in state superior court by stockholders 
gabrielle mayran and rodney shields accuse the defendants of 
wrongdoing in connection with most of northrops major defense 
programs 
highlighted in the lawsuits was the failed attempt to sell south 
korea the f20 tigershark fighter plane which the company couldnt 
sell after spending 12 billion to build it 
mayran and shields claim northrop officials paid bribes in 1983 
and 1984 to south korean government officials to entice them to buy 
the tigershark 
many millions of northrops corporate funds have been wasted 
in illegal bribes and expenditures in an unsuccessful effort to 
sell the f20 tigershark fighter plane while over 1 billion of its 
corporate funds were wasted prior thereto in an inept attempt to 
develop and sell the f20 tigershark the suit said 
a congressional committee and a federal grand jury in los 
angeles already are looking into payments the company made to 
korean companies and individuals in connection with attempts to 
sell the illfated fighter 
the suits also accuse the defendants of wrongdoing in connection 
with the mx missile and the b2 stealth bomber saying problems in 
both systems were due to the incompetence and mismanagement of 
northrop executives 
the defendants include thomas v jones northrops chairman and 
chief executive officer ken kressa president and chief operating 
officer 12 other company directors 21 current and former northrop 
executives and employees and three outside consultants

continental airlines won a major federal court 
victory when a judge ruled lawsuits from the 1987 crash of a 
continental jetliner at denver will be tried under colorado law 
the decision reached thursday would allow a maximum award of 
45000 in physical damages to relatives of crash victims who have 
no dependants 
the decision could save the carrier millions of dollars because 
colorado law is considered the most restrictive in the nation in 
assessing damages lawyers for crash victims had sought trial under 
a more liberal texas law 
us district court judge sherman g finesilver has not yet 
decided what law will govern the award of punitive damages those 
damages awarded if the airline or others are found negligent a 
hearing on that issue is set for oct 18 
the national transportation safety board is scheduled to release 
its ruling on the cause of the crash at a hearing in washington 
dc on sept 27 
continental flight 1713 crashed on takeoff nov 15 1987 
killing 28 passengers and crew dozens of suits have been filed 
against the airline and its parent texas air corp 
finesilver also on thursday set a dec 5 trial date for crash 
lawsuits he ruled that only one of the suits will be tried then as 
a way to save time and money the outcome of that suit which will 
be selected as the most representative of the lot will determine 
how much liability will be placed on the airline and other parties 
in the case

as any casual follower of the stock market 
knows a lot of the markets recent woes have been blamed on rising 
interest rates 
but it is the way rates have been rising even more than the 
simple fact that they have been moving up that particularly 
troubles some analysts 
with several nudges from the federal reserve shortterm 
interest rates on debt securities with lives of a year or less 
have climbed more sharply of late than longterm rates on bonds 
with maturities of up to 30 years 
that means that what wall streeters call the yield curve a 
graphic representation of the relationship between short and 
longterm rates is flattening 
if it inverts that is if shortterm rates go higher than 
longterm rates many analysts believe it would be a sign of 
significant trouble for both the stock market and the economy 
normally interest rates on longterm debt tend to be higher 
than on shortterm loans because longterm borrowers expose 
themselves to greater risk that the purchasing power of their money 
will be eroded by inflation or that the issuer of the debt will 
default 
so when the yield curve tilts in the opposite direction it is 
widely taken as a sign that something is out of whack 
inverted yield curves showed up early in the bear markets and 
recessions that occurred in 197374 and again at the beginning of 
the 1980s 
if the yield curve inverts there is a very high probability 
that a recession will follow said susan berge kent an analyst 
at tucker anthony amp rl day inc in a recent commentary 
recently she noted the ratio of rates on threemonth treasury 
bills to those on 30year treasury bonds stood at 78 
if the ratio rises above 80 and the fed does not cut the 
discount rate historical probability indicates that the yield 
curve will invert she said 
another cause for concern in the view of anthony sorrentino 
technical analyst at standard amp poors corp is the fact that 
rates on threemonth tbills at more than 7 percent are higher 
than the feds discount rate which it recently raised from 6 
percent to 65 percent 
such a positive spread is a sign of a restrictive federal 
reserve policy which usually places downward pressure on the stock 
market sorrentino said 
until the tbill rate falls below the discount rate this 
measure will remain in a bearish mode 
analysts at the financial advisory service donoghues 
moneyletter say managers of money market mutual funds have also 
been sounding a warning about interest rates and the financial 
outlook in recent months 
as a group these managers have been shortening the average 
maturities of the securities in their portfolios 
the standard motive for shortening maturities is to avoid or 
minimize price declines for existing securities when interest rates 
rise and to have money available soon to invest at higher rates 
when these managers believe interest rates are poised for a 
rise they invest their funds in shorterterm securities the 
newsletter said 
since the shortening began the stock market generally has 
been moving sideways and it recently has declined in the face of 
higher interest rates

futures prices for grain and soybeans opened 
slightly lower today on the chicago board of trade on profittaking 
ahead of the long labor day weekend 
we had some pretty good gains here during the week and now 
people are cashing in said victor lespinasse a trader with dean 
witter reynolds inc in chicago 
he said additional early selling pressure stemmed from an 
increase in farmers sales of corn and soybeans overnight and from 
the agriculture departments rejection this morning of chinas 
second bid for 300000 metric tons of subsidized us wheat 
some analysts said traders were disappointed by the usdas 
announcement late thursday that the soviet union had purchased only 
100000 metric tons of us corn rumors earlier in the day had put 
the soviet corn purchase at 1 million metric tons 
in early trading wheat was cent to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 397 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to 2 cents lower with september at 289 a bushel oats 
were cent to 1 cents lower with september at 259 a bushel 
soybeans were 2 cents to 4 cents lower with september at 865 a 
bushel 
cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed 
in early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 05 cent to 15 cent higher with october at 
7125 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent lower to 13 cent 
higher with september at 8105 cents a pound hogs were 10 cent 
lower to 15 cent higher with october at 3890 cents a pound

andersen amp co 
the inquiry is focusing on possible tax violations and illegal 
accounting practices by oglethorpe power corp an atlantabased 
electric cooperative 
richard allen usdas southeast regional inspector general said 
the government also is examining the role of arthur andersen the 
nations largest accounting firm and the auditor for all 11 
cooperatives 
allen said that records from the companies were subpoenaed in 
june but that the cooperatives were not necessarily targets of the 
federal probe at that time 
all of the cooperatives are recipients of loans from the rural 
electrification administration which is part of the agriculture 
department he said 
oglethorpe which is owned by and provides electricity to 39 of 
georgias 42 electric membership corporations has been the target 
of both a civil and criminal investigation by the irs over its tax 
returns from 1980 through 1983 it also reported this year it was 
under investigation by the agriculture department 
the irs in a related probe is investigating atlantabased 
southern co the utility holding company and its subsidiaries 
including the georgia power co in connection with allegations 
that southern defrauded the government of millions of dollars by 
improperly accounting for spare parts 
during the past week investigators from the inspector generals 
office spent three days examining records at the raleigh offices of 
the north carolina electric membership corp said spokesman owen 
bishop 
carl whillock president of the arkansas electric cooperative 
corp in little rock ark said his company provided a limited 
number of accounting documents in response to a june subpoena but 
had heard nothing from investigators since then

we are the target of an investigation whillock said

opec secretarygeneral subroto arrived in kuwait 
friday after visits to baghdad and tehran where he apparently 
failed to settle the problem of setting oil output levels for iraq 
and iran 
in arrival statements subroto indicated that he saw a solution 
only through a revamped production policy for the entire 13member 
organization of petroleum exporting countries 
subrotos talks in iran and iraq this week reportedly focused on 
the question of whether iraq should be allowed to increase its oil 
production quota to parity with iran 
the kuwait news agency quoted him as saying it was necessary 
that opec member states look into this problem iraq and iran 
output within the framework of the basic issue from which opec 
suffers overproduction by opec member states beyond the 1506 
million barrels daily ceiling 
iraq has refused to adhere to its quota of 154 million barrels 
a day demanding parity with irans 2369 million iraqs 
unrestrained current output is estimated at 28 million barrels a 
day 
kuna said subroto indicated the iraqiran production controversy 
cannot be solved separately from the rest of the pending issues 
related to opec production 
among the issues subroto is discussing during his current tour 
of persian gulf nations is the production level of the united arab 
emirates which he visited on an earlier tour and which currently 
is estimated to be producing at least twice its allotted quota the 
uae announced its quota should be 15 million barrels a day 
instead of its alloted 948000 
since late 1986 the cartel has slashed its aggregate output by 
more than 3 million barrels per day to try to stabilize nosediving 
prices around an 18abarrel benchmark 
but quota violations by member states has made the target price 
elusive opecs current output is about 20 million barrels although 
the official overall ceiling set by the cartel is 1506 million 
excluding iraq 
in kuwait last week on his way to tehran and baghdad subroto 
said he believed it was reasonable that iraq and iran should have 
equal quotas of 23 million barrels a day 
his statements to kuna here confirmed he had made no headway so 
far but he was quoted as saying we have not yet despaired and we 
still have a number of proposals in this connection 
subroto said he discussed with iraqi and iranian officials the 
future level of output for each of iraq and iran kuna reported 
he could not predict when a settlement was possible and said a 
single visit to each capital is difficult for reaching a 
solution 
in baghdad earlier in the day subroto declined to comment to 
reporters on the result of his talks there iraqi officials 
described the talks as satisfactory 
the official iraqi news agency said only that iraqs oil 
minister issam abdulrahim alchalabi and subroto discussed 
recent developments in the oil market

a federal judge today dismissed two 
lawsuits seeking 3 billion from space shuttle rocketmaker morton 
thiokol inc by a former company engineer who warned against the 
illfated 1986 challenger launch 
us district judge david k winder granted morton thiokols 
request for dismissal of the suits filed by roger boisjoly who 
left the company in july 1986 citing physical ailments and alleged 
mental torment 
telephone calls to boisjolys willard home were not immediately 
returned 
in his decision winder dismissed most counts in boisjolys 
suits with prejudice meaning they cannot be refiled 
but the judge said he would dismiss two counts of one suit 
which deal with allegations of defamation and conspiracy without 
prejudice 
in one suit boisjoly sought 1 billion for the deaths of the 
seven astronauts killed when challenger exploded on jan 28 1986 
and 1 million in compensatory damages for boisjolys health and 
career 
boisjoly claimed morton thiokol impugned his professional 
reputation after he and other engineers testified before a 
presidential commission investigating the disaster that they had 
warned against the launch 
his other lawsuit filed under the false claims act on behalf of 
us taxpayers sought 2075 billion and alleged that morton 
thiokol knowingly provided nasa with defective solid rocket motors 
winder ruled that the conspiracy alleged in the complaint is 
not of a nature to support an action for damages on the part of 
boisjoly neither the conspiracy itself nor the overt acts 
allegedly done in furtherance of it were directed toward boisjoly 
the judge wrote that to suggest that the recommendation or the 
launch were acts directed toward and for the purpose of injuring 
boisjoly is ridiculous 
furthermore for a reasonable person to know that boisjoly 
might suffer emotional injury as a result of the launch would 
include the requirement that the person know that the launch would 
end in disaster winder added 
the dismissal of these two suits completely vindicates morton 
thiokol said morton thiokol spokesman ed snow we are very 
happy to have this situation behind us 
company attorneys had argued that boisjolys contention that he 
was defamed was based on office chatter it is just 
workplacerelated talk that goes on all the time attorney robert 
jordan told the judge at a hearing in february 
however boisjolys attorney robert levin accused company 
officials of launching a campaign to defame the engineer through 
pamphlets and interviews 
this is not a disgruntled person levin argued this is an 
engineer who stood up and risked his career and hurt his health 
because he had this alternate view 
in a may interview boisjoly said it was only after two years of 
therapy and the positive catharsis of lecturing on the disaster 
that he was able to stop blaming himself for the destruction of the 
shuttle and deaths of its astronauts 
for a long time i bore the burden of guilt because i hadnt 
done more to stop it he said but ive resolved it now i did 
everything i could 
boisjoly and several other morton thiokol engineers argued the 
night before the launch that temperatures of 53 degrees or less 
could cause a rocket joint seal to fail 
but after a second caucus with nasa officials boisjoly said 
company managers perceived pressure from nasa there was no 
other justification for the launch i felt the pressure others 
felt the pressure 
the rogers commission which investigated the disaster blamed 
the tragedy on a leaking joint seal that allowed superhot gases to 
escape and ignite the shuttles external fuel tank investigators 
said the cold had weakened the seal 
boisjoly took disability leave in july 1986 and left the 
company for good two months later 
this year he won the scientific freedom and responsibility 
award from the american association for advancement of science

the stock and bond markets rallied powerfully today after the 
labor department said the us unemployment rate rose to 56 
percent in august a figure that eased concerns the economy was 
growing too briskly 
the news that more americans were out of work cheered up 
investors who were worried that the federal reserve would have to 
raise interest rates to stave off inflation 
bond prices staged their biggest rally of the year driving 
yields back down to the levels of early august the yield on the 
treasurys benchmark 30year bond plunged to 903 percent from 930 
percent late thursday 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials jumped 
5334 points to 205565 by 130 pm edt 
the dow jones averages rise triggered a new york stock exchange 
prohibition on member firms use of nyse automated systems to 
perform a form of program trading known as index arbitrage the 
prohibition kicks in when the index rises or falls more than 50 
points 
the dollar fell slightly against most major currencies as 
investors decided that us interest rates would drop and make 
dollardenominated securities less attractive to global investors 
the labor department said the number of jobless americans jumped 
by 226000 in august to 6851000 as four months of hiring booms 
in factories and retail stores screeched to a halt 
the august figure was 02 percentage point higher than julys 
civilian jobless rate of 54 percent which was up 01 percent from 
junes 14year low of 53 percent 
a separate survey of business payrolls which many economists 
consider a more reliable indicator of the economys health showed 
219000 new jobs in august well below the 400000 average monthly 
increase in june and july 
todays unemployment data followed another government report 
showing the first quarterly decline in us labor productivity 
since 1986 
analysts said the report indicated that hardpressed businesses 
were being forced to hire lessskilled workers to fill job openings 
the labor department said thursday that the labor productivity 
of nonfarm businesses fell 14 percent in the apriljune period 
less than the originally reported 17 percent decline 
the report was roughly in line with expectations and did not 
have a large effect on the financial markets 
stock prices fell thursday in sympathy with previous declines in 
tokyo and london the dow jones average of 30 industrials dropped 
2934 points to 200231 
other reports thursday took some of the edge off fears of 
inflation and rising interest rates 
august sales figures indicated the nations largest general 
retailers were unable to escape their 18monthold slump as weather 
and continuing problems in apparel lines kept customers away 
also the commerce department said construction spending rose 
12 percent in july after slumping in june 
on productivity the labor department released revised figures 
showing productivity fell at an annual rate of 14 percent in the 
apriljune period the statistic measures the output per hour of 
labor for nonfarm businesses 
labor costs shot up at a 57 percent annual rate the biggest 
increase since 1986 reflecting the productivity declines and wage 
and benefit increases averaging 42 percent annually 
charles renfro of alphametrics an economic forecasting firm in 
bala cynwyd pa said the figures indicate that an inflationary 
head of steam is building 
economic output in the second quarter rose 33 percent but to 
achieve the increased output businesses had to raise the number of 
hours worked by their employees by 66 percent 
analysts said the increase in hours and consequent decrease in 
productivity reflects a hiring boom in which employers at a time of 
decadelow unemployment are relying more on lessskilled workers

european trading friday after the announcement of slightly 
higherthanexpected us august unemployment data 
gold prices also fell 
foreign exchange dealers said the dollar dropped sharply against 
the west german mark after the us labor departments announcement 
that the unemployment rate had risen to 56 percent from 54 
percent in july 
most traders had expected the unemployment rate to have remained 
at about the same levels as july they said 
one trader at a german bank in frankfurt said the unemployment 
data accelerated an already noticeable downward trend in the us 
currency because the data suggested the american economy is slowing 
down dampening expectations that the united states would increase 
interest rates in the near future 
however trading generally was quiet friday with many market 
participants confused about the market outlook and unwilling to 
take positions before the upcoming threeday labor day weekend in 
the united states 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day

the nations unemployment rate rose to 56 
percent in august as four months of hiring booms on factory 
assembly lines and in retail stores came to an abrupt halt the 
government said today 
the labor department said the number of jobless americans jumped 
by 226000 to 6851000 in august while the number of those with 
jobs rose by only 121000 to 115180000 
the 02 percentage point increase from julys civilian jobless 
rate of 54 percent followed a 01 percent rise from junes 14year 
low of 53 percent 
the report sparked a rally on wall street the dow jones average 
of 30 industrial stocks climbed sharply in early trading as 
investors apparently viewed the unemployment rise as reducing 
upward pressure on interest rates and inflation 
most of the increased joblessness was suffered by adult men 
with their unemployment rate rising 04 percentage points to 49 
percent the jobless rate among adult women meanwhile fell from 
51 percent to 48 percent the 
a separate survey of business payrolls which many economists 
consider a more reliable indicator of the economys health showed

labor department said 
white house spokesman b jay cooper in california with the 
vacationing president called the report good news 
the continued strong gains in august payroll employment 
confirm that the longest peacetime expansion in us history 
continued through its 69th month the spokesman said 
despite the increase in unemployment cooper said the 
administration was cheered by the good numbers underneath the 
overall numbers such as in the jobless rate for women 
the last time the civilian unemployment rate was at 56 percent 
was in may 
the goodsproducing side of the economy lost jobs for the first 
time since last january with employment in manufacturing dropping 
by 5000 after a 70000 jump in july 
the labor department said small employment gains in printing and 
publishing and exportrelated industries such as machinery and 
electrical equipment were more than offset by 9000 job losses in 
textile and apparel plants and smaller declines in several other 
manufacturing industries 
employment in oil and gas drilling also declined slightly but 
it rose a minuscule 3000 jobs in construction 
on the services side of the economy large monthly increases in 
retail trade hiring 80000 in july alone slowed to just 23000 
new jobs last month virtually all in grocery stores 
other recent highgrowth job areas also slowed business 
services such as temporary help firms added just 16000 new 
workers compared with average monthly increases of 60000 through 
the spring and early summer 
new employment in health services which the government predicts 
will be the largest area of job growth in the 1990s as the baby 
boom population ages slowed to 22000 in august it also had been 
rising an average 30000 a month in the past year 
the labor market showed less strength in august than earlier 
in the year said labor statistics commissioner janet l norwood 
looked at over a somewhat longer period however the rate has 
hovered in the 53 percent to 56 percent range since last march 
and is 04 percentage point below the leval a year ago 
ms norwood said one encouraging sign was that the number of 
people working parttime involuntarily because they could not find 
fulltime jobs returned to the bottom of the 52 million to 56 
million range within which it has been fluctuating for more than a 
year 
the proportion of workingage persons holding jobs remained at 
its record level of 623 percent ms norwood told the joint 
economic committee of congress 
other data in the report however suggested that the economy 
might be slowing the average workweek declined by 20 minutes to 
346 hours and manufacturing overtime fell by 01 hours to 38 
hours a week on average 
that sent weekly earnings down nearly a full percentage point as 
average hourly wages for nonsupervisory workers held steady at 
924 
in the past 12 months the labor department said wages have 
risen an average of only 31 percent decreasing the buying power 
of workers after taking inflation into account by half a percent 
a separate calculation that includes the 17 million uniformed 
armed forces in the job market showed a jobless rate of 55 percent 
last month up from 54 percent in july 
the government offered this other figures on unemployment in 
august 
whites 49 percent up from 47 percent in july 
blacks 113 percent down from 114 percent 
hispanics 84 percent up from 8 percent 
teenagers 158 percent up from 152 percent 
black teengers 158 percent up from 152 percent 
private analysts had anticipated the overall jobless rate might 
rise prior to todays report 
i think were going to be stuck near 55 percent for the rest 
of the year said roger brinner of data resources inc a 
lexington mass economic consulting firm employment is not 
going to fall its just not going to rise as fast as it has been 
brinner like other economists believes too many people many 
of them with only marginal skills have been hired in recent months 
in relation to the rate of economic growth 
we may be at the point where we have absorbed most of labors 
skilled capacity said charles renfro chief economist for the 
forecasting firm of alphametrics also of bala cynwyd anything 
less than an uptick in the jobless rate will be a real danger sign 
that the economy is overheating 
bruce steinberg an economist for merrill lynch noted that new 
claims for unemployment compensation rose slightly last month an 
indication of increased layoffs in some areas 
steinberg believes there is still room for the jobless rate to 
fall over the next several months but not in august

grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher 
friday on the chicago board of trade in a late surge fueled by 
technical factors 
it was a pretty dull day newswise said victor lespinasse 
a trader with dean witter reynolds inc 
prices had opened slightly lower on profittaking ahead of the 
long labor day weekend and in reaction to an increase in farmer 
selling of corn and soybeans 
the higher close extended for a fourth day a modest rally that 
has pushed wheat prices to a twomonth high some analysts believe 
the wheat market is primed for a sharp upturn based on expectations 
of tightening world supplies 
at the close wheat was 1 cent to 3 cents higher with september 
at 401 a bushel corn was unchanged to 2 cents higher with 
september at 291 a bushel oats were cent lower to cent 
higher with september at 259 a bushel soybeans were 6 cents 
lower 7 cents higher with september at 873 a bushel

penalty

us district court in boston accused robert slattery a division 
vice president of reebok of profiting by misusing privileged 
nonpublic information in reeboks acquisition of another footwear 
firm avia group international inc based in portland ore 
without admitting or denying the charges slattery agreed to 
disgorge 11130 in profits and pay an equal sum in penalties 
the sec said slattery on feb 11 1987 purchased 1000 shares 
in avia for 19 a share shortly after that he learned that reebok

loss of 9209 the agency alleged

trading of stockindex futures began saturday in 
japan theoretically giving investors a new opportunity to protect 
themselves if and when the big rally in the worlds largest 
securities market ends 
although stockindex futures have been blamed by some critics 
for playing a significant role in the october stock market crash in 
the united states there seems to be little concern the same thing 
could happen here partly because of what strategists called 
japans penchant for caution 
the japanese are a very wise people said alan johnson an 
asianpacific futures specialist at citicorp scrimgeour vickers 
international ltd they like to acclimatize themselves properly 
before doing anything going off the board isnt their way of life 
their way of life is to do all their homework very carefully and 
make sure it works 
a distinctly american financial invention that the japanese have 
been eying for years stock index futures are obligations to buy or 
sell the equivalent cash value of a group of stocks at a set price 
on a set date 
purchased for only a small fraction of their total worth index 
futures theoretically enable investors to bet on the overall 
direction of the stock market index futures can serve as hedging 
mechanisms against a market drop or an inexpensive way to speculate 
on a market advance 
their eagerly awaited premiere in japan comes at a particularly 
opportune time because japanese stock prices have been trading 
near their record highs there has been increasing concern over how 
long the rally will last and investors have been looking for ways 
to protect themselves in a decline 
the debut of index futures in japan also coincides with 
simmering controversy in the united states on the impact of such 
financial strategies us critics say index futures encourage 
reckless speculation and conflict with the kind of longterm 
investing in individual stocks that is essential for healthy 
markets 
moreover the critics contend the development of highspeed 
computerized trading of index futures and the stocks that comprise 
them in order to profit from price differences a technique called 
index arbitrage has injected frightening volatility into the 
markets and discouraged wouldbe investors 
some studies have blamed index arbitrage for aggravating the 
oct 19 collapse of stock prices in the united states 
in us trading the most popular index futures are based on the 
standard amp poors 500stock index and the major market index a 
measurement of 20 stocks that closely tracks the more widely known 
dow jones industrial average 
the japanese concocted their index futures based on the nikkei 
index of 225 selected issues which began trading saturday on the 
osaka securities exchange and the tokyo stock price index called 
topix which began trading on the tokyo stock exchange 
japanese market professionals said trading began slowly 
reflecting an underlying cautious approach they said it would 
probably take a few years for the japanese to develop profitable 
index arbitrage computerized strategies and in the meantime the 
impact on stock prices likely would be small 
part of the problem in developing such strategies they said is 
that some stocks represented in the nikkei or topix indexes cannot 
be traded via computer which makes complicated arbitrage 
strategies difficult 
in addition japanese stock markets are protected from wild 
swings by the daily limits placed on individual shares another 
potential obstacle to profitable arbitrage between stocks and index 
futures 
both the nikkei and topix contracts will have a limit of 3 
percent for a single day of trade although if the market is 
orderly then exchange officials have the power to allow continued 
trading 
of course when volume builds up over time the futures will 
become another factor affecting stocks said a futures trader at 
salomon brothers incs tokyo office who asked not to be 
identified by name but i dont think there will be all that much 
speculative interest

a coalition of 24 travel agencies in utah 
has taken legal action in an effort to combat what it claims are 
unfair trade and pricing practices by delta air lines 
the group called the independent travel agency alliance 
contends that delta has entered into exclusive marketing 
arrangements with utahs three largest travel agencies placing 
members of the alliance at a competitive disadvantage 
the delta marketing agreements according to the coalition 
allow the three big travel agencies murdock travel morrisask 
mr foster and beehivebonneville travel group to offer special 
bulk fares or tourbased fares 
bulk or tourbased fares which airlines have designed for the 
leisure travel market do not require advance booking by travelers 
and represent a significant reduction from airlines standard fares 
the special fares include roundtrip air travel and in some 
instances either a car rental or hotel accommodations 
alliance members claim they are not allowed to offer the special 
fares to their customers and as a result have lost substantial 
business 
attorney richard w giauque of salt lake city said a complaint 
was filed thursday with the us department of transportation on 
behalf of the 24 utah travel agencies 
he said the complaint seeks an order barring atlantabased delta 
from offering the special travel arrangements or compelling the 
airline to make them available to all travel agents 
al kolakowski deltas assistant vice president of sales said 
the bulk fares are designed for the leisure travel market and not 
the business travel market 
weve been offering these fares across our system he said 
the fares are part of a tour package which can include mandatory 
car rental or a minimum stay in a hotel 
but alliance members contend that utahs big three travel 
agencies are aggressively advertising and promoting the special 
fares to corporate clients

for minnetonka corp there may be 
only one obsession but now the company hopes to extend its 
success in the personal fragrance business into eternity 
minnetonka is spending about 18 million to launch eternity 
another calvin klein fragrance that the company says will appeal to 
a growing set of americans interested in true romance and lasting 
love 
robert taylor founder and chairman of bloomingtonbased 
minnetonka said he expects the new floral scent to be as popular 
as its steamier predecessor obsession 
obsession stands for the 60s and 70s of the sexual 
revolution its warm and sensual taylor said i think 
eternity stands for love romance and commitment 
regardless of the values they espouse both perfumes have the 
smell of money 
obsession is the sales leader at calvin klein cosmetics corp 
the subsidiary that accounted for an estimated 105 million of 
minnetonkas 1987 sales of 1524 million said marsha raley a 
stock analyst for dain bosworth inc minneapolis 
we think eternity will be as big as obsession taylor said 
largely on the continued strength of obsession sales minnetonka 
is expected to record net income in 1988 of about 155 million or 
95 cents a share raley said that compares with net income of 
101 million or 57 cents a share in 1987 not counting the 
aftertax gain of 65 million on the sale of softsoap to 
colgatepalmolive co 
theyre very creative raley said theyre good at 
identifying mass psychology trends 
if you read the public right and you simplify what the public 
wants and you color it the way you think they want it colored then 
you end up striking a successful chord raley said 
taylor and kim delsing executive vice president of calvin klein 
cosmetics credit the fashion designer for attaching significance 
to eternity klein is settling down after undergoing treatment for 
an addiction to vodka and valium and his life mirrors the message 
of eternity delsing said in fact the fragrance got its name from 
an inscription on a ring purchased by klein about a year ago for 
his wife he bought the ring from a duke of windsor collection 
everything about eternity so epitomizes his new lifestyle 
delsing said 
but eternity wasnt designed in random creative fashion 
taylor said instead minnetonka identified a niche in the perfume 
market opposite obsession and screened the samples that klein chose 
from 
its more of a directed creative approach taylor said we 
didnt want to cannibalize obsession 
minnetonka has hopes that both fragrances will prove to be 
classics channel no 5 for instance has survived for 65 years 
taylor whose company acquired calvin klein cosmetics in 1981 
said hell keep obsession and eternity alive by restricting 
distribution to about 700 stores at 185 an ounce 10 more than 
obsession eternity is decidedly upscale and gets prime display 
space he said 
we dont do anything unless its prime taylor said 
eternity made its debut from june through august at two saks 
fifth avenue stores in new york its national launch officially 
began this week but dayton hudson department stores have been 
selling it since the first weekend in august said john brennan a 
senior buyer of fine fragrances for minneapolisbased dayton hudson 
its been tremendously successful brennan said we had 
customers literally grabbing four or five bottles off the first 
cart as it was being unpacked 
taylor said eternity has been his companys chief focus for the 
past year next year an eternity for men will be developed and 
calvin klein cosmetics will introduce a line of dressing 
accessories such as belts purses and cosmetic bags 
meanwhile calvin klein continues to hold about 12 percent of 
minnetonka corp stock which has been selling in the range of 16 
a share taylor said klein has no intention of seeking a 
controlling interest in the company

the environmental protection agency said 
friday it plans to levy a 14 million civil fine against minnesota 
mining and manufacturing corp for illegally importing and using 
two unspecified chemicals 
the agency said it had cut the proposed penalty in half because 
the st paul minnbased company voluntarily disclosed the 
violations immediately after they occurred 
the agency said it was not disclosing the chemicals in question 
and the dates of the violations because 3m was entitled to keep 
that information confidential 
federal law forbids manufacturing importing and commercial use 
of chemicals not on epas approved list unless the agency is given 
90 days notice to review the new chemical 
3m has 20 days to answer epas charges in st paul company 
spokesman mark fenner said he was unable to comment because he had 
not been made aware of the accusations

the soft drink makers are recruiting some tough 
characters for commercials designed to convince men that its okay 
to drink diet colas 
this summer it was boxer mike tyson in commercials for diet 
pepsi this fall it will be a few dozen pro football players for 
diet coke 
its a new approach for sugarless sodas a majority of which 
have traditionally been consumed by women 
a decade ago the soft drink makers say women consumed about 75 
percent of the diet soft drinks purchased atlantabased cocacola 
usa said that percentage has since fallen to about 65 percent 
nonetheless michael beindorff vice president of advertising 
for cocacola said a big block of men remains averse to diet 
soft drinks 
he hopes to change that attitude with a campaign that begins 
monday and will eventually feature players from every national 
football league team in local print and broadcast ads for diet coke 
the first commercial airs during the seasons first monday night 
football telecast on abc matching the washington redskins and the 
new york giants 
in the ad redskins linemen charles mann and dave butz toss a 
quarterback rather than a coin to decide who gets the last diet 
coke during practice 
additional ads will appear locally during the season in some 
cases players will appear in versions of an ad adapted for local 
use 
for instance beindorff said one local ad will show three 
players from a team with a tiger a bear or some other team symbol 
as the camera pans over them the announcer will say three out 
of four bengals or bears or whatever prefer diet coke 
jesse meyers publisher of beverage digest a trade publication 
based in greenwich conn said soft drink sales rose about 4 
percent last year to 40 billion but that the diet segment has 
been growing four to five times faster 
his 1987 beverage rankings listed diet coke as the third best 
selling soft drink behind cocacola classic and pepsi with 77 
percent of the market and diet pepsi fourth with 48 percent 
meyers gives pepsi high marks for clearly identifying the male 
image with its ads that featured tyson who defended his 
heavyweight title and said diet pepsi did too in taste tests 
against diet coke 
beindorff said the new diet coke ads were in development long 
before the tyson ads ran while he would not disclose how much they 
cost he said the fees for all the football players will come to 
only a fraction of the 125 million he said pepsi reportedly paid 
tyson

a report that more americans were out of work 
triggered a powerful rally on wall street friday as investors 
figured a slowdown meant less inflation and lower interest rates 
the governments report of a rise in the civilian jobless rate 
to 56 percent in august helped calm a market that has been worried 
for months that the economy was growing too quickly and might go 
into an inflationary spiral 
its bad news i guess for job searchers but its not 
necessarily bad news for consumers in general said george 
iwanicki an associate economist for kidder peabody amp co 
stock prices leaped and the dow jones average of 30 industrial 
stocks rose 5228 points to 205459 its biggest rise since a 
7468point gain on may 31 
the rise of more than 50 points triggered a restriction on 
member firms use of computers for a form of program trading the 
collar is designed to avoid chaotic swings in stock prices 
fridays rally began in the bond market which staged its 
biggest rally since oct 22 the aftermath of the stock market 
crash according to an index of all outstanding treasury issues 
maintained by shearson lehman hutton inc 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond staged its 
secondbiggest rally of the year the price of the treasurys 
30year bond briefly rose almost 30 for every 1000 in face value 
late in the day the long bonds price was up about 2590 
driving its yield down to 904 from 930 percent late thursday the 
only bigger rally of 1988 was a 2625 price increase on jan 15 
after the government reported a big drop in the trade deficit 
the bond market is highly sensitive to inflation and takes 
weaker growth as good news when bond prices rose investors moved 
to the stock market in search of bargains 
for stock investors the higher jobless rate was good news 
because it seemed to lessen the likelihood that the economy was in 
the late stages of an inflationary boom that would end up with a 
bust said david bennett a market analyst at prudentialbache 
securities inc 
in the long run a slight increase in joblessness could mean 
more stable prolonged growth bennett said 
in spite of the uptick in the jobless rate from 54 percent in 
july and a 14year low of 53 percent in may the economy continues 
to be expanding and the nation is not far from full employment 
iwanicki said 
fundamentally the economy is quite strong said helen 
hotchkiss a senior economist at drexel burnham lambert inc 
analysts said the slight increase in the jobless rate eases 
pressure on the federal reserve to raise interest rates to cool 
down the economy in particular it reduces the probability that 
the central bank will move before the election to raise its 
discount rate which it charges on loans to banks 
the number of jobless americans grew by 226000 in august and a 
fourmonth hiring boom in the nations factories ended abruptly 
the government said 
a separate survey of business payrolls showed employers adding 
219000 new jobs in august compared with average monthly gains of 
more than 325000 the previous three months 
despite the increase in the unemployment rate the labor 
department said a record 623 percent of the workingage population 
16 and over held jobs in august 
average hourly wages for nonsupervisory workers held steady at 
924

contrary to earlier evidence about the economy the labor 
department report implied that growth is easing thereby relieving 
inflation pressure and lessening the prospect of higher interest 
rates

make dollars more valuable

the least said john w baker chief currency dealer at the new 
york office of bank julius baer amp co a swiss banking concern

economic reports provides more evidence of a slowdown then the

dramatically

the treasury bond market posted its biggest gain 
of the year and interest rates tumbled friday as a new report on 
employment in august indicated the pace of economic growth may be 
slowing 
the report defused concerns at least for the time being that 
the economy may be growing so fast that it could ignite inflation 
which eats away at the value of fixedincome investments such as 
treasury notes and bonds 
slower growth is a plus for bond prices because credit demands 
and price pressures are usually lower in such periods and interest 
rates can fall 
the shearson lehman daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer climbed 1224 points to 114250 
that was the biggest rise since a 1500point advance on oct 
22 1987 when the federal reserve was standing ready to provide 
liquidity to the financial system in the wake of the stock market 
crash the biggest rise in the composite index this year had 
previously been a 1205point increase on jan 15 
the treasurys 30year bond climbed nearly 2 points or about 
26 for every 1000 in face amount that was slightly below the 
2625 rise on jan 15 when the market was cheered by a narrowing 
of the nations trade deficit 
its yield which moves in the opposite direction from its price 
skidded to 904 percent from 930 percent late thursday that was 
its lowest since it finished at 903 percent on aug 4 
the bond rally was sparked by the governments report that the 
nations unemployment rate rose to 56 percent in august from 54 
percent in july 
a companion report on business payrolls said there were 219000 
new jobs in august and revised downward the payroll growth 
previously reported for july in addition the report indicated a 
decline in hours worked and only a slight increase in average 
hourly earnings index for august 
william v sullivan jr director of money market research for 
dean witter reynolds inc said the report allays the markets 
fears that the economy was moving into an overheated phase 
he said the pace of trading was moderate a pickup from the slow 
pace that has preceded release of the report 
elliott platt director of fixedincome research at donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette securities corp said it was one of the most 
broadlybased good reports we have seen in a long time 
sung won sohn chief economist for norwest corp in minneapolis 
said the report means there is virtually no chance that the fed 
will tighten in the near future since the economy appears weaker 
than some presumed it was 
platt said the report may mark a turning point for trends in 
longterm rates but sohn said he expects rates will head higher 
later this year 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues rose by between point and point intermediate 
maturities were up by between a full point and 1 points and 
20year issues were up 2 points according to telerate inc a 
financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
in corporate trading prices rose moodys investment grade 
corporate bond index which measures price movements on 80 
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer rose 334 
to 28776 
yields on threemonth treasury bills meanwhile fell to 742 
percent as the discount fell 8 basis points to 720 percent yields 
on sixmonth bills fell to 778 percent as the discount fell 8 
basis points to 740 percent yields on oneyear bills fell to 804 
percent as the discount fell 16 basis points to 750 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity

the new york stock exchange said friday that it 
has removed the rights of two specialist firms to make markets in 
four stocks following inquiries into their conduct during the 
october crash and its aftermath 
the disciplinary move by the nations biggest stock market 
against the firms stern amp kennedy and spear leeds amp kellogg 
brought to 11 the number of stocks that have been reallocated from 
nyse specialists because of probes into how well they handled the 
panicky buying and selling during the crash 
in the nyse system for stock trading 54 specialist firms 
control the rights to market certain stocks and are required to 
keep order by setting opening prices and covering trades using 
their own money when there are too few buyers or sellers 
specialist monopoly rights on stocks are considered extremely 
valuable because the firms get the great majority of business in 
those stocks removal of those rights by the nyse is considered a 
significant punitive measure 
the nyse said after the crash that it would investigate several 
cases in which the specialists failed to maintain orderly trading 
in stocks they controlled nyse spokeswoman sharon gamsin said the 
announcement friday marked the conclusion of those investigations 
as is nyse policy she declined to elaborate on what the 
specialists did or failed to do but she reiterated the big boards 
position that we think the specialists did an excellent though 
obviously not perfect job 
carl hewitt a staff attorney at spear leeds amp kellogg said 
the firm would have no comment on the nyses action a receptionist 
who answered the telephone at stern amp kennedys office said nobody 
was available to comment 
a brief nyse press statement said the exchange would reallocate 
stern amp kennedys rights in loctite corps stock following a 
review of the specialist firms actions on black monday oct 19 
the statement said spear leeds amp kellogs specialist rights 
were removed from alleghany corp and greyhound corp because of 
the firms performance on oct 20 and its specialist rights were 
moved from kysor industrial corp because of the firms oct 22 
performance 
after discussions with the nyse stern amp kennedy and spear 
leeds amp kellogg agreed voluntarily to withdraw as the specialist in 
each of the stocks the statement said 
an nyse committee that assigns stocks to specialists was 
accepting applications from other firms that want to make markets 
in the four stocks and will likely announce its decision next week 
ms gamsin said 
for spear leeds amp kellogg one of the biggest nyse specialist 
firms it was the second reallocation resulting from postcrash 
inquiries previously the firm surrendered its franchise in jp 
morgan amp cos stock 
in addition the specialist firms wagner stott amp co mj 
meehan amp co lawrence odonnell amp co and labranche amp co have 
relinquished marketmaking rights in some stocks since the crash

the purchase of lucky markets by american 
stores co should be stopped because it would cost california 
consumers millions of dollars a year in higher food prices the 
state attorney general said friday 
attorney general john van de kamp filed suit in us district 
court here late thursday seeking to block the 25 billion 
purchase of lucky stores inc by american stores which runs the 
supermarket alpha beta 
van de kamp said a merger of the two companies would violate 
state antitrust laws 
the deal and the unrelated purchase of 172 safeway stores in 
southern california by the vons cos had been approved by the 
federal trade commission which analyzes the effect of business 
combinations on competition and prices 
but van de kamp standing in an alley beside one of americans 
alpha beta markets in the predominantly hispanic westlake district 
accused the ftc of failing to protect the interests of california 
consumers 
this injustice will strike most cruelly at those least able to 
afford it the poor the elderly the least mobile of our 
citizens those who cannot afford high prices and who cannot flee 
their neighborhood market for distant lower prices van de kamp 
said 
american has said the deal would result in lower prices because 
of the efficiency of a larger operation 
van de kamp sought a temporary court order blocking the 
americanlucky combination until a trial but us district judge 
david v kenyon delayed a decision until tuesday so he could study 
the case 
meanwhile van de kamps staff continued to negotiate with vons 
on a settlement of similar allegations about the el montebased 
grocery chains 408 million purchase of 172 safeway stores in 
southern california vons already has started converting the stores 
van de kamp said the talks appeared to be making progress but 
warned he would take vons to court immediately if the negotiations 
broke down 
american which recently moved its corporate headquarters from 
salt lake city to irvine calif is one of the nations largest 
supermarket companies its holdings include acme markets on the 
east coast skaggs alpha beta alpha beta and buttery in the west 
and the 27state osco drug chain 
the transactions would give the combined alpha betalucky chain 
550 stores and vons 350 stores with the two chains together owning 
half the supermarkets in the state 
in opposing the california mergers van de kamp cited a study 
commissioned by his office that found the combination of americans 
alpha beta with lucky and the safewayvons deal would increase food 
prices by 400 million a year in the state 
as a condition of its approval the ftc required american to 
sell 37 markets to competing chains to maintain competition vons 
was required to sell 12 stores

the region that we get this matter settled he said i hope the 
supply systems action will be a positive element in the region and 
become a catalyst for further reasonable settlement 
by leaving the case the supply system will save millions of
