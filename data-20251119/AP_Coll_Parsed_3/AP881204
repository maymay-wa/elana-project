ronald reagan and mikhail s gorbachev who 
have made arms control history together are bound to revisit their 
idea of a dramatic reduction in strategic weapons when they meet 
over lunch this week but a nudge forward rather than a 
breakthrough is the most thats likely to result 
the strategic arms reduction treaty that they have been talking 
about the hopedfor centerpiece in reagans arms control program 
has too many holes in it for gorbachev and reagan to reach command 
decisions during their threehour luncheon wednesday on governors 
island in new york harbor 
moreover gorbachev is well aware that he is dealing with a lame 
duck president who will have six weeks left in office and will be in 
no position to commit his successor george bush to any course of 
action 
for all that max m kampelman the chief us arms control 
negotiator finds it difficult to believe arms will not be discussed 
during lunch 
i believe it will come up kampelman said in an interview 
last week but i dont believe it will come up in a negotiating 
context my own judgment is it will come up as a discussion and 
maybe a quick review of where things stand now 
kampelman added and i guess perhaps an expression on both 
sides they hope to finish the work i cannot myself envisage any 
detailed discussion of the arms negotiations taking place 
the unfinished strategic arms treaty will be turned over to 
presidentelect bushs administration with the us side hopes a 
renewed commitment from gorbachev to maintain its current high 
priority 
in a report to congress on friday reagan accused the soviet 
union of violating existing arms control agreements with the united 
states we cannot conclude new strategic arms control agreements 
while this violation remains uncorrected the report said 
the report cited krasnoyarsk a siberian radar installation that 
the administration contends violates the 1972 antiballistic missile 
treaty 
however reagan did not accuse the soviets of a material 
breach of the agreement which could have led to its unraveling 
and national security adviser colin d powell said reagan was not 
expected to make a major issue of the us allegations in the 
meeting with gorbachev 
reagan intends to raise arms control issues with the soviet 
leader just as he will bring up the suspended red army withdrawal 
from afghanistan and the human rights situation officials say 
but the vital ground work simply has not been undertaken this 
time for example secretary of state george p shultz did not have 
a planning session with foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze to 
set an agenda and to define the issues for their leaders 
arms negotiations were adjourned in geneva on nov 15 and the two 
sides have not met since 
they ended the 10th round of talks agreeing to an early 
resumption in 1989 the united states subsequently proposed feb 15 
the soviets did not respond 
reagan and bush probably will have shultz and a handful of other 
senior us officials at the luncheon table with them but the us 
and soviet arms control experts who normally labor over the details 
while the leaders hold their summits plan no such sessions 
shultz has predicted a substantive discussion another us 
official mindful of gorbachevs innovative style remarked you 
never can tell 
but the hard fact is that the treaty to reduce us and soviet 
armories of longrange bombers missiles and submarines by 30 to 50 
percent is still mired in disagreement on several key points 
the two sides have not decided for instance whether to include 
mobile missiles or sealaunched cruise missiles both are extremely 
hard to track that means cutbacks are hard to verify the room for 
cheating is uncomfortably wide 
the soviets meanwhile still would like to restrict reagans 
strategic defense initiative as part of a treaty deal the 4 
billionayear program is designed to stop ballistic missiles in 
space but critics here and in moscow say it could extend the arms 
race to a new and dangerous sphere 
then there is the fact a new us administration is coming 
aboard one that may not share the outgoing administrations views 
on reducing strategic weapons 
brent scowcroft designated by bush to be his national security 
adviser is worried that large cutbacks in us strategic weapons 
could make the warsaw pacts edge in conventional forces in europe 
more significant 
he also is concerned that reducing the us arsenal of landbased 
intercontinental ballistic missiles could expose those that remain 
to a higher risk of being destroyed in the event of a soviet attack 
bush will be at the table deferring to reagan it will be 
president reagans meeting he said 
and yet reagan will be aware that in a sense he will be 
speaking also for bush and should not commit his successor to 
positions he may not want to take after jan 20

if hes done his reading in soviet history 
mikhail s gorbachev knows just what to expect when he arrives in 
new york city on tuesday 
it will be a huge noisy city with an enormous number of neon 
signs and automobiles hence vast quantities of exhaust fumes that 
are choking people 
it will have a humid unpleasant climate terrible poverty 
and slums and protesters who act like howling tomcats 
it will have forests of tall buildings but after all if 
youve seen one skyscraper youve seen them all 
those were the observations of the late soviet leader nikita 
khrushchev following his visits to new york in 1959 and 1960 if 
gorbachev has read khrushchev remembers the last testament 
hes probably having second thoughts about ever setting foot in the 
citadel of capitalism 
of course much has changed since khrushchevs last visit in 
september and october of 1960 
khrushchevs trip took place at the height of the cold war just 
after the shooting down of an american u2 spy plane over the soviet 
union 
gorbachev will be visiting new york during one of the warmer 
periods in superpower relations when u2 is best known as a rock 
group from ireland 
khrushchev arrived by ship to a sodden reception at a dilapidated 
east river pier gorbachev will arrive by jet and be greeted by a 
delegation of un officials and a 25footby10foot sign 
inscribed general secretary welcome to john f kennedy 
international airport the port authority of new york and new 
jersey 
khrushchev was booed almost everywhere he went with the notable 
exception of harlem where he paid an unexpected visit on cuban 
leader fidel castro in a rundown hotel 
gorbachev may be booed somewhere along the line but he probably 
wont do what khrushchev did boo back and gorbachev is going to 
wait until after his new york trip to visit castro in cuba 
khrushchev was shunned by president dwight eisenhower and the men 
running to succeed him sen john f kennedy and vice president 
richard nixon gorbachev will be meeting with both president reagan 
and presidentelect george bush 
khrushchev went to wall street on his first new york visit in 
1959 and got to meet with the biggest capitalist in the world 
nelson rockefeller gorbachev may skip wall street but has accepted 
an invitation from real estate tycoon donald trump to visit trump 
tower 
finally gorbachev will almost certainly keep his shoes on in 
public it was during the 1960 trip that khrushchev took off his 
shoe and pounded it on the table in front of his seat at the united 
nations thereby fixing his image in american memories forever 
some people did not seem to understand this unparliamentary 
method khrushchev wrote in his memoirs 
khrushchev said he was not overly impressed by new york but 
he stuck around for more than two weeks on his last visit and kept 
his hosts wondering when he would leave 
i feel like staying so im not going he said at one point 
i will stay here but apparently i will not be granted 
citizenship

the melding of communism and democracy under 
mikhail s gorbachev is long overdue americas top communist said 
on the eve of the soviet leaders visit 
for years ive been saying the socialist countries should move 
in a democratic direction said gus hall general secretary of the 
70yearold communist party usa theres no big threat they 
can afford it 
it is true of any society certain things get stuck and 
changes dont take place corresponding to the new conditions its 
necessary to shake up a society he said socialism had reached 
a level where some of the negatives had piled up somebody had to 
provide a lead moving them to a higher state 
glasnost and peace initiatives were among the topics on halls 
mind as he and other americans awaited gorbachevs visit to new york 
tuesday through thursday the soviet leader will address the united 
nations general assembly and meet with president reagan and 
presidentelect george bush 
ive met gorbachev before he became general secretary and then 
since said hall 78 who has been employed fulltime as general 
secretary of the american communist party since 1959 and has run for 
president four times since 1972 
hes of a different generation and therefore in many ways 
hes easier to deal with hes very friendly and outgoing and easy 
to talk to if you express differences it doesnt seem personal 
with him hall said of gorbachev hes not afraid to try 
glasnost calls for trial and error and he seems to be very bold 
in trying new ideas 
this is a historic moment in the socialist countries they have 
developed problems and they are correcting problems they will 
discard what doesnt work and keep what works the chinese are doing 
a similar trial and error hall said in an interview thursday i 
think much of it will stick theres an experimentation with a 
market economy and doing away with some of the centralization 
that had taken place 
the communist party usa advocates cooperatives and mom and 
pop style private enterprise but eschews big corporations and 
foreign involvement said spokeswoman carole marks 
hall who jokingly calls himself the big red said he sees no 
contradiction in a communist advocating democracy either here or in 
the soviet union 
theres no question that the more democracy the easier it is 
for people to fight for their rights like trade unions the more 
rights they have the stronger they will be in fighting for wages 
and so on he said therell be some blurring of lines but it 
will not basically change the socialist concept 
in this country our party has always stood for expanding the 
democratic structure part of the electoral structure is very 
undemocratic we didnt run for president this year because the 
restrictions were so severe it was hard to get on the ballot he 
said 
the last time he did run in 1984 hall polled 36386 votes which 
was enough to beat out the socialist workers candidate but fell 
54418689 votes short of reagan 
despite his misgivings about the presidential election hall said 
he thinks the bush administration will not be quite as ideological 
as the reagan administration but more realistic and practical 
the bush administration will have to find some way of cutting 
the expenditures you cant be a firstrate power in the world 
if you are a second or thirdrate power at home and economically 
marks said the united states has about 25000 cardcarrying 
communists 
were involved in the mainstream political life in this 
country were accepted as the longstanding organization on the 
left she said 
the group advocates creating a new political system for the 
united states but would not model it after the soviet union or any 
other government she said

at first dans secret was small and shameful 
then it festered and grew and took on a life of its own tormenting 
its keeper until it controlled his every waking hour 
one day dans secret became so ugly and overwhelming he could no 
longer contain it it came out at last how dan had been sexually 
molested by an older brother who climbed into bed with him at age 9 
and kept coming back for 10 years 
but as terrible as it was dans secret was only one piece of a 
truth far more horrifying it was like a pebble tossed in the deep 
silent pool that was his family causing everwidening ripples and 
revelations 
about 50 of my relatives have been abused at least those are 
the ones i know about said dan 23 who asked that his full name 
not be used it gets passed from generation to generation and 
nobody talks about it and it so it never stops 
dans oldest brother who had molested dan had himself been 
molested by a favorite uncle a female cousin had been molested by 
her father dans mother had been molested by a male relative other 
cousins had been molested by their siblings or other relatives 
dan was not alone as a male survivor of incest in his own family 
and he is not alone in the united states a 1985 los angeles times 
survey found that one of every 15 adult males reported having been 
sexually abused before the age of 18 
an estimate of 15 million abused men is conservative said 
therapist mike lew who works with male survivors of incest at his 
next step counseling and training center in newton mass outside 
boston 
that doesnt include men who dont remember the abuse that 
doesnt include men who at this point arent able to talk about it 
yet who are feeling too ashamed or too frightened said lew 
author of victims no longer a book about recovery for male 
incest survivors its just beginning to be safe enough to talk 
about it 
women were the first to talk about incestuous abuse partly 
because it is easier for society to accept the idea of women as 
victims lew said 
men arent supposed to be victims he said men are 
supposed to be able to handle everything to be strong to be 
dominant we dont know what to do with a man or boy whos been 
victimized we either define him as something other than a man or 
something less than a man or we deny the reality of the problem 
hank estradas personal denial lasted 25 years until the day he 
discovered that the same uncle who had abused him for 12 years also 
had tried to molest one of hanks nephews 
i got this nephew to tell me what had happened said estrada 
32 to do that i had to share my own experience which was very 
difficult but i didnt want him to go through what i did 
his sister the boys mother reported the uncle to the 
authorities but because the abuse had merely been attempted and 
because it was the boys word against the uncles no charges were 
filed 
estrada told his own story of abuse which began at age 4 and 
lasted until he was 16 but the statute of limitations had run out 
it was a blatant denial by the system to let this man go 
estrada said theyre just waiting for him to do it again 
when estrada went looking for support services for himself to 
show i was not the evil one for bringing all this out he found 
none the only services available were for perpetrators two years 
ago he started plea for prevention leadership education and 
assistance a los angelesbased group that offers support and 
information to adult male survivors of abuse who are not abusers 
themselves 
a common misconception is that men who are sexually abused as 
children always become perpetrators themselves lew said in fact 
many male incest survivors become protectors of other people dan 
for example works with the retarded 
many of the men who come for therapy come when theyve become 
parents or when their children reach the age they were at when they 
were abused lew said they come in determined that this is not 
going to happen to their children theyve heard the mythology that 
men who have been abused automatically become child abusers and 
they want to make sure they wont abuse children 
for many abused men the idea of victimizing someone else is 
horrifying they know firsthand the terror guilt and pain of being 
a victim they know how an abuser who is often someone a little boy 
mosts trusts and loves father mother brother or uncle can turn 
those emotions against the victim filling him with guilt and 
selfloathing 
dan tried to commit suicide twice he used food as an escape in 
his sophomore year of high school he weighed 310 pounds 
the biggest reason i ate so much was hoping i could become ugly 
to turn my brother off so he wouldnt touch me dan said it 
didnt work it just added to my problems 
at 19 the abuse had become too much i couldnt stand the 
feeling of guilt of shame of hating myself for what was going on 
i knew it had to stop and i was the only one to stop it dan 
said i got a gun illegally and kept it in my nightstand and i 
swore if he touched me i would kill him 
dan has since told his parents about what happened and has 
confronted his brother who denies having a problem estradas 
uncle now in his 60s still lives with his relatives and has access 
to dozens of children 
that makes it imperative for male incest survivors to tell their 
stories estrada believes unless society knows that boys too can 
be incest victims it always will be difficult for future victims to 
summon the courage to tell anyone about what is happening to them 
break the silence break the cycle of abuse 
most of the men who call and write me say i always thought i 
was alone theyre in so much pain themselves they never thought 
about their abuser doing it again to someone else estrada said 
it may have happened to you and its in the past but it doesnt 
stop there

a longdelayed inquest into the 
police killing of three unarmed ira men is putting british justice 
in northern ireland to another of its periodic tests of credibility 
it took six years to get the inquest going but within hours of 
starting nov 14 it was mired in controversy with families 
demanding police be crossexamined 
the hearing in the courtroom in craigavon county armagh is the 
latest chapter in a debate that has raged since 1982 over whether 
the british in their war against the irish republican army 
sometimes step beyond the law and shoot suspects dead on sight 
there were three such incidents in 1982 another occurred in 
gibraltar in march when antiterrorist agents gunned down three 
unarmed bombing suspects a muchdisputed inquest cleared the agents 
of wrongdoing 
and this summer after an ira bomb killed eight soldiers on a 
bus three armed ira men were gunned down allegedly while on an 
assassination mission 
the british government denies it ever acted outside the law but 
many critics question this and the issue has bedeviled government 
efforts to prove itself evenhanded in its treatment of the 
provinces catholic minority 
major initiatives like new antidiscrimination laws improved 
housing and education and investment in the strifetorn economy 
tend to be obscured by the lingering catholic refusal to believe in 
british justice 
gervase mckerr 31 and eugene toman and sean burns both 21 
were killed on nov 11 1982 as they drove on a road in lurgan 
county armagh 
their inquest began in september 1983 but was adjourned until now 
because of the trial of the three policemen who were acquitted of 
murder charges and the police refusal to turn over photographs and 
statements to defense attorneys 
at their trial the three policemen testified that they believed 
toman and burns intended to attack the security forces and did not 
know the three were unarmed 
families of two of the ira men walked out on the inquests first 
day because the coroner refused to order the three policemen who 
carried out the killings to appear in court he cited rules unique 
to northern ireland which allow witnesses to submit written 
statements without ever appearing for crossexamination 
the families want the policemen crossexamined under oath 
the wife of the third victim failed to win a high court ruling 
against the coroner and has turned to the appeals court the 
inquest meanwhile is adjourned pending the appeals court hearing 
at one point seamus mallon deputy leader of the moderate social 
democratic and labor party the provinces largest catholic party 
got so upset at the inquest that he jumped from his public gallery 
seat to demand that the police testify 
i make this request in the interests of creating a proper 
system of justice in the north of ireland mallon said i plead 
with you not to let it be turned into the charade that a vast number 
of people now believe it to be 
john stalker a senior police investigator from mainland britain 
says he was removed when he got too close to proving that police 
conspired to shoot the men possibly in revenge for the ira murder 
of three policemen and then covered up their actions 
the british government admits there was perjury and a coverup in 
the royal ulster constabulary the provinces police force but has 
ruled out prosecutions on national security grounds 
the constabulary being 85 percent protestant has a hard time 
convincing catholics that it is exercising its sweeping powers with 
restraint statistics show that less than 25 percent of those 
arrested under antiterrorism laws in the province are charged 
moreover to overcome jury intimidation security suspects are 
tried by onejudge nojury courts 
unlike in mainland britain inquest juries in northern ireland 
cannot return actual verdicts only basic findings of who died and 
when and where they were killed 
the coroner cant say that the constabulary men were guilty 
of shooting these people he cant say that these people should be 
tried theyve already been tried which is another farce says 
jackie donnelly spokesman for the outlawed iras legal political 
wing sinn fein 
amnesty international in a report in june maintained that 
northern ireland inquests cannot address questions central to the 
circumstances of deaths and to responsibility for deaths because 
they cannot return a verdict of unlawful killing

president fidel castro of cuba said saturday 
that he hopes presidentelect george bush will be more pragmatic 
than his predecessor in recognizing latin american realities 
its always better to deal with a pragmatic man than to deal 
with a man like president reagan who has a mind from the last 
century if that doesnt offend the last century said castro at a 
news conference 
but he said he he could not speculate on any changes in the 
abrasive relationship between the united states and communist cuba 
under the new bush administration 
they say bush is more pragmatic and less ideological than 
reagan said castro but well have to see what happens and how 
the new administration behaves 
castro said his visit here for the inauguration of carlos salinas 
de gortari as president of mexico is a sign that the united states 
longterm policy of isolating cuba has fallen apart 
thirty years have gone by and were still here he said 
castros forces overthrew the dictatorship of fulgencio batista on 
jan 1 1959 castro noted that most countries in latin america had 
joined attempts to isolate cuba 
we never came to an inauguration before because they didnt 
invite us said castro but now ecuador and mexico have invited 
us us policy is a total wreck and cubas position is being 
vindicated by latin america 
he said he had met with colombian president virgilio barco during 
the salinas festivities because although we dont have diplomatic 
relations we do have real relations 
we have never changed he declared but now the situation 
has changed 
he said he hopes the incoming bush administration accepts the 
reality of latin americas staggering foreign debt problems and that 
any agreement on the debt is the result of negotiation 
its not a small problem like grenada said castro they 
wont be able to resolve the problems created by the debt with the 
82nd airborne 
he said the reagan administrations central american policy had 
failed in nicaragua el salavador and panama 
one of the first tests of the bush administrations pragmatic 
spirit will be whether they are ready to negotiate with nicaragua 
he said 
as far as salvador is concerned the test will be whether they 
want to look for a solution by military means or by political 
means 
also during the threehour news conference castro lashed out at 
the south africans saying they arent serious about peace in 
their region 
talks aimed at a pullout of cuban troops from angola and 
independence for south africanruled namibia broke off saturday 
without an agreement 
castro said more negotiations are needed adding if we have to 
stay there another ten years we will

the military flight of space shuttle 
atlantis continued today with its usual official silence as the 
public heard no word about the spaceship or its five crewmen 
the silence results from a defense department policy to reveal as 
little as possible about military shuttle missions 
but no news was good news for nasa and the air force said they 
would break the silence only if a major problem developed 
there was no information on whether the crew accomplished its 
main goal deploying a powerful allweather radar satellite designed 
to gather extremely sharp images of eastern bloc military 
facilities it would help american intelligence officials monitor 
soviet compliance with arms treaties 
the satellite eventually will serve as the radar eye for the 
new b2 stealth bomber picking out potential targets that will 
eliminate the need for the aircraft to use its own radar which 
might disclose its location 
the astronauts were to release the satellite with the code name 
lacrosse on saturday reliable sources reported before the flight 
the sources also said the astronauts were to conduct several 
experiments aimed at defining mans role as a military observer in 
space with reconnaissance a high priority it was believed they 
would test a special optical device that resembles binoculars 
the crew members are navy cmdr robert l gibson the commander 
air force lt col guy s gardner the pilot col richard m 
mullane and lt col jerry l ross of the air force and navy cmdr 
william m shepherd 
the flight which began friday with a blazing liftoff from cape 
canaveral is expected to end monday or tuesday with a landing at 
edwards air force base calif 
the national aeronautics and space administration planned to 
announce the landing time 24 hours in advance

authorities today ordered 
civilians evacuated from a neighborhood surrounding a rebel 
stronghold in this capital as new military units were reported to 
have joined the insurrection 
troop and tank movement was reported in several areas near buenos 
aires as army loyalists apparently prepared to obey president raul 
alfonsins order to suppress the threeday revolt backup troops 
also were reported being flown in from neuquen 750 miles southwest 
it is the third army uprising since april 1987 and the latest 
challenge to the civilian government since it restored democracy in 
1983 after a nearly eightyear military dictatorship in which at 
least 9000 suspected leftists vanished without a trace 
mayor carlos brown of suburban san martin was quoted by local 
news agencies as saying he had received orders to evacuate all 
civilians from the area surrounding a unit taken over saturday by 
about 500 rebels headed by col mohamed ali seineldin 
police firemen and civil defense volunteers began evacuating the 
workingclass residential area this morning 
reporters outside the 10th logistical batallion told local news 
agenices the rebels appeared to fortifying their defense and had 
moved a tank into position blocking the entrance 
alfonsin as armed forces commander sent a message to all 
military units early today asking them to be alert to violent 
options of some groups that march against history and hide their 
real goals 
although the majority of units throughout the country maintained 
their loyalty the official news agency telam reported the 6th 
infantry regiment in mercedes 62 miles west of the capital had 
joined the revolt led by seineldin 
the independent news agency noticias argentinas reported the 4th 
paratroop brigade near cordoba 470 miles northwest also joined the 
insurrection 
the government and political leaders called on argentines to 
demonstrate in town plazas across the country in favor of democracy 
and in repudiation of the rebels more than 100000 were reported to 
have filled plazas in buenos aires and rosario some staying 
overnight 
sporadic shootings were reported overnight at campo de mayo the 
nations largest army base on the outskirts of buenos aires where 
seineldin first took over an infantry school early friday there 
were no reports of injuries 
four soldiers have been injured since the uprising began three 
soldiers were wounded by a mine blast in january during a similar 
army rebel uprising in monte caseros 520 miles northeast of buenos 
aires 
although surrounded outgunned and outmanned by loyal troops the 
rebels were able to board trucks saturday afternoon and drive 
unhindered to the unit in the villa martelli neighborhood of san 
martin 
several explosions were heard saturday night inside the 
rebelheld unit where angry civilians shouted insults and threw 
rocks at troops wearing combat gear and camouflage paint 
a bomb tossed from a moving car exploded but caused no damage 
or injuries outside the 5th infantry brigade in northern tucuman 
telam reported 
alfonsin who spent the night in the heavily guarded government 
house in downtown buenos aires said saturday night in a nationwide 
radio and television address that he had ordered the army to 
suffocate the revolt 
the army chief of staff gen jose dante caridi simultaneously 
issued a communique accusing seineldin of trying to impose 
inadmisable conditions that endanger the constitution 
the rebels the army said want changes in the government and 
national authorities the removal of the army chief of staff and his 
replacement by a general picked by them as well as the right to 
select other highranking officers 
the rebels earlier had also demanded an end to prosecution of 
officers for human rights abuses committed during the dictatorship 
and had sought an increase in the armys budget trimmed as part of 
the austerity measures taken by a government battling an annual 
inflation rate of 330 percent

convention only the conventioneers arent the type who wear red 
fezzes and nametags 
anchorage this fall is brimming with moose the animal type 
perhaps 900 of them or 100 more than the total that feasted on 
urban shrubbery two years ago said the state department of fish and 
game

chewing up mountain ash trees the animals are bulling their way 
through traffic nosing around fastfood franchises and hanging 
around a synagogue 
we got a pot full o moose around here said state game 
biologist mike mcdonald 
the problem could get worse in the next two months when moose 
from the chugach foothills make their move into the city to escape 
the snow buildup at higher elevations mcdonald said 
mcdonald said the moose population has been helped by mild 
winters the past two years they pumped out calves like i cant 
believe mcdonald said 
earlier this week police said they watched a big bull moose 
stroll across a parking lot and begin to step gingerly over a new 
pontiac the moose dropped a hind foot and dented the hood 
then theres the cow and calf who live in a park across the

ticket engineers who were deemed to have sounded horns 
unnecessarily maybe we can do a little more negotiations now

the brass bells that herald the annual 
salvation army christmas kettle drive are in a longterm decline 
the salvation army said an increasingly busy impersonal world 
has depleted the number of volunteers willing to stand in the cold 
to drum up donations 
col leon ferraez spokesman at the salvation armys national 
headquarters in verona nj said that nationwide about 42000 
volunteers hit the streets for last years kettle drive which 
generated about 27 million 
the number this year is up slightly to 45000 thanks to the 
opening of new shopping malls that have agreed to provide space but 
ferraez said thats a far cry from the early 1960s when some 
100000 volunteers were out ringing bells 
despite the drop in volunteers ferraez predicted about 30 
million will be collected this year 
maj david brindley salvation army area coordinator for 
columbus said it is now a rare day that more than half the 100 
collection spots in the city are manned 
everybody has his own agenda said brindley who recalled 
when most volunteers were willing to put in 10hour days every day 
for a week or two most workers now log one and twohour shifts 
this is really an aberration of the last generation most of 
our volunteers are busily engaged in earning a living the biggest 
decrease has been among what was always our largest workforce 
women theyve got jobs now and have to make ends meet too 
the salvation army operating in 90 countries was founded 123 
years ago to help the poor in england by former methodist minister 
william booth 
those likely to volunteer these days are members of civic groups 
college students and those who have received or are seeking help 
from the salvation army the latter two groups are the only bell 
ringers who get paid 
its only minimum wage but we feel that paying them for their 
time will help those who cant afford to have a real christmas 
ferraez said college students who need the money to get through 
school get paid too

a handshake and promises were all that 
sealed the more than 41 million settlement between 44 victims 92 
attorneys and over 40 companies in the lambiance plaza building 
collapse before it was filed in court 
that may have indicated the confidence the parties had in the 
cases chief mediator us district judge robert c zampano 
obviously this settlement is the closest thing to the eighth 
wonder of the world in the courts point of view said us 
district judge tf gilroy daly all of us refer cases to him 
zampano he has extraordinary patience 
the settlement signed thursday stemmed from the april 23 1987 
collapse of a partially completed apartment complex in bridgeport 
twentyeight men were killed and 16 injured 
claimants blamed the accident on liftslab construction in which 
precast concrete floors are hoisted into place 
zampano said there could have been hundreds of lawsuits and 
thousands of counterclaims from the tragedy and experts said it 
could have taken 10 to 15 years for the lawsuits to go through the 
court system 
the mediation involved federal state and probate courts the 
federal occupational safety and health administration and the state 
workers compensation commission 
we just took it one day at a time zampano said in an 
interview friday 
daly said zampano is known for settling difficult cases out of 
court and has a gift for listening in a kindly manner and 
hearing what both sides really say 
everyone knows if zampano takes a look at it if he cant do 
it mediate a settlement i dont know who can daly said 
zampano 59 is a graduate of yale law school and a former us 
attorney who began practicing law in 1954 he has been on the bench 
for nearly 25 years 
the lambiance case was his most complex he said the months of 
negotiations sometimes occurred on weekends holidays and at night 
zampano also handled his own cases during that time 
he said he felt a twing of fear two days before thanksgiving when 
he realized no one had signed anything 
it was all done by handshake i thought what if someone said 
i didnt promise you 3 million i said 300000 zampano said 
but nobody did 
in june he and the other member of the mediation panel superior 
court judge frank s meadow interviewed the victims families he 
said it was the saddest month of his life the case was like going 
to 28 wakes and 28 funerals he said 
you just cant meet parties who suffered such great losses 
without it being heartwrenching he said 
four months ago an appraiser told him that the land on which the 
building collapsed wasnt worth as much as it should be because of 
the stigma under the settlement the building will be 
reconstructed with some profits going to the victims 
that has turned right around zampano said developers are 
calling me and saying they want to be a part of it four months ago 
it was a monument to death now its a monument to life 
on thursday more than 200 people crowded into zampanos 
courtroom to watch the filing of the settlement 
it took a person with his exceptional skills to accomplish 
this said us attorney stanley a twardy jr a lot of judges 
refer cases to him he brings the parties together and works them 
back and forth 
we negotiate every day in life when buying a car or a house 
zampano said but for some reason when people get in a lawsuit the 
general feeling is well fight to the finish 
but when we bring them in they really dont want to go to 
court if you can bring both sides in sit down and rationally talk 
it out more than 95 percent of the cases should be settled

a 13yearold boy who tucked away the script of a 
school play written by his teacher unwittingly preserved the only 
known copy of a drama by author george orwell the sunday times 
reported 
the short historical drama entitled king charles ii about 
the kings flight to france after his fathers execution will be 
auctioned by sothebys in london on dec 15 the weekly said 
orwell wrote the play while teaching at the private hawthorns 
high school in hayes outside london in 1932 the year before he 
changed his name from eric blair with the publication of his first 
book down and out in paris and london 
geoffrey stevens a retired construction merchant told the 
newspaper it was not until many years later that he realized his 
teacher at hawthorns was the famous author of animal farm and 
1984 and that he had pocketed a literary treasure 
he was mr blair and that was how we knew him stevens was 
quoted as saying of course i had heard of george orwell much 
later i just never realized they were one and the same until i was 
reading an article about him and saw his photograph 
i always thought there was something special about him a 
lofty teacher who seemed in a world of his own he was quoted as 
saying i dont know why i preserved his play i suppose i liked 
him enormously and i keep most things im glad i did 
the school play idea was used in orwells second novel a 
clergymans daughter the newspaper said

a group of girls has gone on strike in a village 
in south china refusing to do housework tend the fields or take 
care of their siblings unless their parents let them attend school 
according to a report seen sunday 
we want to go to school and study one of the 14 girls was 
quoted as saying and if our families wont let us well make 
trouble if we dont win this one our lives will be finished her 
name was not provided 
the communist party newspaper the peasant daily said the girls 
between 8 and 15 years old are fighting an antiquated chinese 
tradition which holds that education is for men only 
but they are also battling recent economic changes that have made 
education more costly for many peasant families 
most of the girls from jia cui village arent allowed to go to 
school said the report about the village in guangxi province 
those few that do go only make it to the third or fourth grade 
chinas education system faces a shortage of funds as the cost of 
books electricity food and other services has soared due to rising 
inflation 
as a result many schools have started levying fees 
contradicting an official policy of free education for all 
in the cities teams of workers often pay these fees but in the 
countryside individual households are often stuck with the bill so 
peasant families tend to send their boys to school and keep their 
girls at home 
in this way chinas new economic difficulties are reinforcing 
old sexual distinctions that kept women uneducated and bound to the 
home 
indeed an official study released earlier this year said that 
women make up 64 percent of the illiterates in china 
in addition it said that girls comprise 83 percent of the 
countrys 27 million schoolaged children who have not yet started 
school 
the newspaper report published saturday said many meetings have 
been held in the village to persuade families to let their children 
go to school 
last semester a teacher even started night classes for 
girls the paper said but night classes need lamp oil and no 
families would give any the classes lasted one month and then 
folded 
the paper quoted the mother of one of the strikers as saying she 
opposed her daughters action 
girls have got to marry early if they dont stay at home and 
learn to do labor and craft work now they wont marry well later 
on the mother said 
so far eight of the girls have been allowed to go to school the 
others are waiting for the village to set up another night class 
the paper said

complying with an order from the 
australian government yugoslavia closed its consulate sunday and 
called its staff home including a security guard accused of 
shooting a demonstrator 
the departure of 12member staff and their families ended a 
standoff between the two nations that began last week when the guard 
allegedly shot and wounded a teenager during a croatian 
demonstration outside the consulate 
australia ordered the consulate closed after it refused to allow 
australian authorities to question the guard 
yugoslavia protested the order expelling the diplomats and 
claimed that the guard fired in selfdefense when demonstrators 
charged the consulate and australian authorities were unable to stop 
them 
security was tight sunday when police escorted cars carrying the 
yugoslavs from the consulate in the sydney suburb of woollahra to 
the airport where they departed on a yugoslav airlines flight 
sunday night 
more than 100 police guarded the airport but an expected 
demonstration by croatians failed to occur 
the australian government has reserved the right to claim 
compensation from yugoslav officials for the family of jospeh tokic 
16 who was shot in the throat during the protest on nov 27 
yugoslav national day 
yugoslav authorities said the guard identified as matijas zoran 
fired in selfdefense when several croatian youths began scaling the 
consulate walls croatians are among several ethnic groups in 
yugoslavia 
about 200000 yugoslavs live in australia 
yugoslavia strongly criticized australia on saturday for closing 
the consulate and expelling its staff but did not did not threaten 
to retaliate

in a year in which the white house will have a 
new occupant and the senate will be under new leadership the house 
of representatives promises to be a bastion of stability 
house democrats and republicans meet this week to elect their 
leaders and appear likely to return most of the top positions to the 
same hands including house speaker jim wright of texas and minority 
leader robert michel of illinois 
wrights ethics problems he is being investigated for alleged 
financial improprieties and on charges he improperly disclosed 
classified information have stirred some unease among democrats 
but do not appear to have threatened his leadership position 
other top democrats in the group that took power in 1987 will 
also retain their posts thomas foley of washington as majority 
leader tony coelho of california as majority whip and david bonior 
of michigan as coelhos chief deputy 
theres no question the team is together coehlo said it 
worked together for two years i think that we had an excellent 
two years very very productive 
you had a speaker who set an agenda in marked contrast to 
that of president reagan and managed to wrest control over much of 
us policy coehlo said 
the only real battle on the democratic side when the votes are 
cast monday behind the closed doors of the house chamber will be 
for the chairmanship of the house democratic caucus the policy 
organization of all house democrats the position holds no real 
powers but it can be used as a platform for gaining visibility as 
it did for its previous occupant rep richard gephardt dmo 
rep william gray dpa is seen by many as the favorite to win 
the post after campaigning hard all year and spending more than 
115000 on campaign contributions to fellow democrats including 99 
members of the 101st congress 
his chief opponent rep mary rose oakar dohio has charged 
that grays effort has improperly injected big money into an 
internal house race for the first time rep mike synar dokla 
also is seeking the post 
either gray or oakar now the vice chairman of the caucus would 
be trailblazers for the democrats 
gray would be the first black to gain a rung on the house 
administrative leadership ladder that can lead to the speakers job 
he is completing the maximum four years as budget committee 
chairman a win for oakar would make her the first woman to break 
into the partys top leadership 
michel is unopposed for minority leader the top republican 
leadership position he has held for the past eight years 
there will be a shift in the no 2 slot for the gop as 
republican conference chairman dick cheney of wyoming moves up to be 
minority whip a post vacated by mississippis trent lott as he 
moves over to the senate 
the only fight on the republican side is over who will succeed 
cheney as conference chairman 
normally the heir apparent would be rep jerry lewis rcalif 
who has been the partys policy committee chairman but he faces a 
stiff challenge from rep lynn martin of illinois a quick 
outspoken lawmaker who has been conference vice chairman also 
running for the post is rep william dannemeyer rcalif 
the house meetings come a week after the senate informally 
convened to get organized for the coming year and democrats elected 
sen george mitchell of maine to succeed west virginias robert byrd 
as majority leader 
in their meetings house democrats also will consider a list of 
proposed rules changes including one proposed by rep charles 
stenholm dtexas to force disclosure of who would benefit from 
specialinterest provisions in legislation 
the proposal would require the listing of the name of each 
beneficiary the cost to taxpayers of the provision and the name of 
the lawmaker who sponsored it the aim is to prevent members of 
congress who vote for a bill from later being embarrassed by 
discovery of specialinterest provisions 
stenholms suggestion was considered by a leadership panel which 
declined to support it on grounds that it would impose unreasonable 
burdens on committees particularly the tax and spending panels 
which most frequently deal with specialinterest measures

lee thomas says he was proud to be leading the 
treehuggers the nickname for people who put environmental 
concerns above all else out of the closet at the environmental 
protection agency 
concern for natural resources swamps endangered species green 
and furry things is not something to be looked down on thomas 
said in an interview marking the close of his nearly four years as 
administrator of the governments largest regulatory agency 
it isnt widely recognized that the laws guiding epa are heavily 
aimed at protecting health in the agency we had lost the sense 
we had both missions and that one was connected to the other 
thomas said 
if you dont protect wetlands youre eventually going to have 
major problems in water quality eventually that translates into 
health issues 
to a remark that the agency sometimes seemed full of closet 
treehuggers thomas replied with emphasis as it should be 
it was clear thomas was refusing to accept the term as one of 
derision 
asked which accomplishments he is proud of the first concrete 
actions he lists are the littlenoticed establishment of a wetlands 
office in epa and a program focusing protection of estuaries the 
wide mouths of rivers where the tide meets the fresh water 
ahead of those he lists an intangible achievement the 
establishment of us leadership in international discussions of 
global climate change 
thomas was not known as a treehugger of any variety when he came 
to epa 
he has degrees in education and psychology and was a familycourt 
probation officer before becoming director of public safety in the 
south carolina governors office where his duties included 
management of emergencies 
he came to washington in 1981 as associate director of the 
federal emergency management agency he directed flood relief 
efforts in 1982 at the dioxincontaminated town of times beach mo 
later supervising the federal buyout of residents homes 
success attracted white house attention president reagan 
nominated him as assistant epa administrator to oversee the 
superfund toxic waste cleanup program succeeding the fired rita 
lavelle early in 1983 
he was to have been part of a team of managers the white house 
sent in to shape up an agency in turmoil over accusations of 
political manipulation of superfund 
impressed with what he saw as rare administrative selflessness 
and openness epa administrator william d ruckelshaus recommended 
thomas as his successor when he resigned in late 1984 
thomas has been there ever since in a job he calls the best job 
in washington and the worst one that leaves the holder 
aware of the fact youre not going to get any attaboys from any 
side 
thomas is leaving without any idea what he will do next 
his biggest disappointment he said was the failure of congress 
to decide what to do about the 68 cities and rural counties that 
failed to meet federal air quality standards for ozone at the 1987 
deadline 
were kind of in limbo he said 
the debate over the clean air act according to some in congress 
illustrates what they say is thomas big shortcoming 
he was cooperative but we got no leadership out of the white 
house when we absolutely needed it said rep mike synar dokla 
chairman of the environment and natural resources subcommittee of 
the house government operations committee 
lee thomas is very sharp wellrespected knowledgeable on the 
issues and no question about it very bright he has continued to 
restore the credibility of the agency but he doesnt have 
political clout down at the white house 
peter aa berle president of the national audubon society 
makes a similar but more favorable assessment he has struggled 
mightily in some areas successfully and in some areas not so 
successfully he has had practically no support from the white 
house i would have hoped he would have cut through some of the 
bureaucracy around superfund 
in the agency thomas is considered a bureaucrats bureaucrat 
and its a bureaucrats improvement he suggests for congress 
congress he said ought to step back and look at their 
organizational arrangements for dealing with epa with 75 
committees and subcommittees according to the agencys count 
claiming a piece of the action they just dont have the structure 
to do any kind of priority setting 
the interest groups say i want it done my way and the only 
way i can make sure its done my way is to have it written into the 
law 
even though congress spells out details such as how many 
superfund investigations must be completed by specific dates thomas 
believes it sometimes shies away from what should be the major point 
in the last sessions clean air debates thomas said he never got 
a clear answer from members to the question are you willing to 
say a maximum individual risk of cancer of one in 10000 is ok 
because the alternative is to shut the plant down thats a decision 
i have to make

adults tried their luck officials said sunday 
the holders of the 1 lotto tickets beat odds of nearly 13 
million to 1 in winning the jackpot the biggest in the 12year 
history of the state lottery

prime minister benazir bhutto 
installed her cabinet on sunday holding the defense and finance 
portfolios for herself and naming a foreign minister who served 
under the late president mohammed zia ulhaq 
the moves followed her orders saturday to free political 
prisoners convicted under martial law and commute all death 
sentences those orders are expected to be acted on by president 
ghulam ishaq khan 
in a news conference ms bhutto said the appointment of 
sahabzada yaqub khan to head the foreign ministry is a signal of 
continuity in pakistans stand on the war in neighboring afghanistan 
pakistan with help from the united states supports moslem 
anticommunist guerrillas fighting the sovietbacked kabul 
government and shelters more than 3 million afghan war refugees 
despite her bitter opposition to zia ms bhutto said during her 
election campaign that she would maintain his afghan policy until 
the fighting stops and the refugees feel safe to go home 
zia died in an aug 17 plane crash weeks after approving 
elections for pakistan authorities suspect sabotage in the crash 
which also killed us ambassador arnold raphel and 28 others a 
probe is continuing 
ms bhutto who took the oath of office friday stocked her 
government with stalwarts of her pakistan peoples party except for 
yaqub khan 
all 10 cabinet ministers and seven ministers of state the second 
echelon in rank took the oath of office sunday administered by 
ishaq khan 
although she assigned no ministers for defense or finance ms 
bhutto appointed special advisers with the rank of minister 
she named yahya bakhtiar as attorney general the same post he 
held in the 1970s under her father prime minister zulfikar ali 
bhutto it was zia who overthrew bhutto in 1977 bhutto was hanged 
two years later after his conviction for conspiring to kill a 
political rival

signed a unmediated accord in april in which moscow promised to 
withdraw all of its more than 100000 combat troops from afghanistan 
between last may 15 and next feb 15 
about half have already left but the pullout is temporarily 
stalled because the communists claim islamabad is violating the pact 
by continuing to arm the rebels 
pakistan claims it is entitled to because washington and moscow 
also agreed to continue supplying their respective clients in the 
10year war until the other side stops 
in her first official act as prime minister ms bhutto 35 
called saturday for the release of about 1000 political prisoners 
convicted under zias martial law 
in a recommendation to the president she also called for the 
commutation of all death sentences and the release of all female

police are puzzled by a rash of 14 
homicides in the 10 days since thanksgiving in the twin cities area 
considered one of the safest metropolitan areas in the country 
its very strange said sgt marvin rorvick of the 
minneapolis homicide unit which is investigating seven deaths in 
two arson fires nov 26 and 27 we go months without any murders 
and all of a sudden theres a burst its hard to understand why 
fiftysix homicides have been recorded in minneapolis this year 
already breaking the record of 48 in 1975 and 1986 in 1987 46 
homicides were recorded 
in st paul two stabbings and two stranglings in the past week 
boosted to 18 the number of homicides in st paul in 1988 six more 
than all of last year but fewer than the record of 20 in 1985 said 
police spokesman paul adelmann 
three other homicides in the latest rash occurred in bloomington 
and hopkins 
i dont have an explanation for it said lt russell bovee 
head of the st paul homicide division but we dont need anymore 
the recent string of murders has put a tremendous strain on our 
manpower ive got people in the street with very little sleep 
i think what you have is coincidence said peter parilla a 
sociologist at the college of st thomas with expertise in 
criminology these are isolated incidents as a general rule i 
wouldnt say theres cause for concern 
according to fbi figures for 1986 minnesotas major crime rate 
per 100000 people was 25 compared with 107 for new york 113 
for michigan and california and 117 for florida 
the underlying pattern of violence in society is the only link 
between the murders said kathleen alme director of the crime 
victim center in minneapolis many people feel the need to solve 
problems that way she said

a government decree published sunday bans 
men from working as hairdressers and orders all beauty salons to 
dismiss their male employees 
the interior ministry said the decision was taken because the 
work of men in the profession is contradictory to the profound 
values of the nation and its authenticity according to government 
newspapers 
most iraqis are moslems and the islamic religion forbids men and 
women to mingle in public unless the women are veiled 
the ministry warned that it will inspect hairdressing salons to 
make sure the order is observed

the soviet union is highly unlikely to launch a 
sudden military attack on nato forces in europe despite fears of 
western military leaders about a pearl harbortype strike a 
congressional study said sunday 
the soviets dont have enough welltrained forces to mount such a 
strike and would likely be detected by western intelligence 
officials if they tried to prepare concluded the review by the 
house armed services defense policy panel 
soviet forces along the front with the north atlantic treaty 
organization countries are generally maintained at a lower level of 
readiness to fight than their nato counterparts the study said 
even the bestprepared soviet troops would take at least a week 
before they were ready for offensive combat action said the 
study which was based on closeddoor hearings by the panel last 
fall 
the soviets apparently do not believe they can best achieve 
their goals by virtue of a surprise attack that defeats nato in a 
very few days it said 
although nato can never completely discount the possibility of 
a standing start surprise attack the soviets are apparently not 
preparing for such an attack the study concluded 
the soviets would face similar problems if they tried to prepare 
an attack with longer lead times of several weeks permitting 
greater mobilization the study said 
the study cited three instances in which it said the soviets took 
lengthy amounts of time to prepare for armed action the soviet 
military action in afghanistan the 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia 
and the 1980 polish crisis 
the possibility of a sneak attack similar to the type mounted by 
japan on dec 7 1941 against the us navy in hawaii has long 
worried nato planners 
most often cited is the fear that the soviets will attack west 
across the german border where the united states maintains about 
250000 military personnel in west germany 
natos ground forces are generally more ready than warsaw pact 
ground forces the study said 
the biggest problem for nato would be if the alliance delays 
mobilizing for war in answer to obvious warsaw pact preparations 
the study found 
in this case the warsaw pact gains a significant advantage 
when it has time to ready its forces for an attack and nato does not 
respond the study said the pact advantage builds until nato 
mobilizes 
the soviets couldnt covertly mobilize because nato intelligence 
would spot the preparations the study said 
the much more likely way the warsaw pact could obtain a 
mobilization advantage is by a nato failure to respond to warning 
it said the real question for nato is whether nato decision 
makers would respond to warning and make a timely mobilization 
decision this is a very difficult issue 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the panel said nato has 
to have the kind of clear timely warning of pact war preparations 
that will convince the public particularly in europe that 
countersteps have to be taken to prevent war 
such timely warnings could come from arms control agreements 
requiring for example each side to notify the other about 
movements of troops heavy equipment and the like aspin suggested 
the united states should press for those warnings as part of any 
arms control agreement aspin said soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev has indicated he wants to back away from military 
confrontation in europe if he means it such agreements would be a 
significant step in that direction 
rep william dickinson rala senior gop member of the 
committee warned that i do not believe we should cavalierly 
discount the threat of soviet surprise attack as a nato force 
planning criterion 
the soviets still maintain a very formidable force structure 
and that provides planners in moscow the capabilities they need to 
conduct military operations of all types under all scenarios 
including surprise attack if they are so inclined dickinson said

for two days a herd of elephants nursed 
a wounded elephant calf after nudging him along the road to the 
nearest human protection in the forests of eastern india united 
news of india reported sunday 
it took the elephants six hours to cover the two miles to their 
destination a forest rangers office the staff administered first 
aid to the 2yearold calf but he later succumbed to head wounds 
inflicted by a tiger 
tears rolled out of the mother elephants eyes as the rest of the 
herd formed a circle raised their trunks and trumpeted over the 
body 
uni said the tale was related by sg ochi project manager of 
forest development in simlipal national park in orissa state 140 
miles west of calcutta 
ochi said the herd of about 25 elephants apparently was grazing 
in a grasslands about two 2 miles from the rangers office when a 
tiger tried to seize the calf 
devandra nayak a tracker for project tiger a government 
organization trying to save tigers from extinction watched the 
herds progress as it brought the calf to the rangers office nayak 
said the herd paused intermittently to let the wounded elephant rest 
when the elephants reached a salt lick near the rangers office 
the mother elephant picked up a clump of dry grass in her trunk and 
fanned flies away from her calfs head wound 
the elephants apparently thought the proximity of people would 
keep the tiger from returning for the kill uni said 
according to the report as the midday sun shone down and the 
heat grew intense most of the herd sought shelter under some trees 
300 feet away the mother left her calf in search of water 
the rangers took advantage of the herds temporary absence to 
wash the calfs wound and apply ointment 
then the mother returned chasing the rangers she sprayed water 
on the calf to cool him and kept vigil with the rest of the herd 
until he died the following day 
the herd again disappeared and the staff buried the calf 
for the next two nights the herd returned and thumped the loose 
earth covering the calfs body 
uni said the episode occurred recently but it did not give a 
date

foreign minister shimon peres said sunday that 
the soviet unions enthusiastic response to israels help in the 
return of four hijackers has given new significance to relations 
with moscow 
peres also noted in a radio interview that israel agreed to the 
speedy return of the hijackers to the soviet union saturday after 
receiving written assurances they wouldnt face the death penalty 
the soviets promised us in writing that these people wouldnt 
be executed and so there was no point in delaying or complicating 
the process he said on army radio 
the return of the hijackers ended a drama that began thursday 
when four armed soviets seized a busload of schoolchildren in 
southern russia then traded them for a plane out of the country and 
a 33 million ransom the hijackers surrendered shortly after 
arriving in israel friday evening 
peres cited the reaction of soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze who personally thanked the chief of an israeli 
consular delegation in moscow aryeh levine for israels help in 
the affair 
shevardnadze was the highest ranking soviet official to meet 
levine since the israeli delegates arrived in moscow in july 
shevardnadze was quoted by foreign ministry spokesman alon liel 
as expressing to levine the thanks and deep appreciation of the 
soviet government and soviet people regarding the noble way the 
government of israel has dealt with this barbaric act 
peres said shevardnadzes gesture was almost without precedent 
in our relations with the soviet union in recent years i want to 
hope this has a significance beyond the event of the day 
the representations in israel and moscow now have a new 
significance peres said he referred to the israeli delegation in 
moscow and a soviet consular delegation that has been in tel aviv 
since july 1987 
levine said on the radio that in his meeting with shevardnadze 
he told the soviet leader we would be very happy to have more or 
less normal relations normal is a very acceptable term in the 
soviet union and i took advantage of this opportunity to use it 
the soviet union broke diplomatic ties with israel during the 
1967 middle east war but has gradually warmed relations over the 
last two years with the exchange of consular delegations and a 
liberalization of jewish emigration permits 
israeli newspapers also echoed peres hopes that the weekend 
hijacking drama which involved unusual diplomatic exchanges between 
the israeli and soviet governments would improve ties with moscow 
the daily haaretz ran a frontpage analysis entitled the plane 
fell like a blessing from heaven an analysis in the daily 
hadashot was headlined israel scores many points at a low price 
eitan golan who headed the israeli police team that questioned 
the hijackers said one of them whom he did not identify 
threatened to commit suicide if he was returned to the soviet union 
golan also quoted the hijackers as saying they chose israel for 
asylum because they knew israel and the soviet union lacked 
diplomatic ties and they counted on the fact that israel would not 
hand them over 
golan said the hijackers seemed nervous but cooperated fully with 
investigators 
my impression is that this wasnt the most sophisticated group 
in the world he said

while republican presidentelect george bush 
was having a cordial lunch with jesse jackson recently democrats 
were hoping that a contest for their party chairmanship wouldnt 
become a racial fight 
if were not careful and we turn the chairmanship fight into a 
racial thing then yes we can alienate everybody said jim 
ruvolo chairman of the ohio democratic party 
that was a big reason why many democrats were waiting anxiously 
to hear on monday whether paul g kirk jr was willing to seek a 
second fouryear term as chairman 
kirk under heavy pressure from party leaders to stay in his job 
planned to announce his decision at a monday afternoon news 
conference 
at a meeting last month with state democratic party leaders kirk 
indicated his reluctance saying four years is a long time and 
eight years is twice as long 
but the party chairman has received appeals from party leaders 
including the defeated democratic presidential ticket of michael 
dukakis and lloyd bentsen to stay on 
while kirk has received nearunanimous praise for the job he has 
done the past four years another reason for the appeals was the 
desire to avoid a fight to succeed him that could divide the party 
along racial lines 
interested in competing for the chairmanship if kirk does not run 
are ron brown a washington lawyer who was convention manager for 
jackson rick wiener of michigan president of the association of 
democratic state chairs and former reps james stanton of ohio 
james jones of oklahoma and michael barnes of maryland 
brown a former party vice chairman has openly chafed at the 
fact that opposition to him is based on his role in the jackson 
campaign 
i think ron brown is right when he says hes been around the 
democratic party longer than jesse jackson said ruvolo likely to 
succeed wiener as head of the state chairs association 
all but brown have said they would bow out of the contest if kirk 
decides to seek another term brown has refused to make such a 
commitment although of the impact it would have on his plans he has 
said if kirk runs obviously it makes it more difficult obviously 
its less likely 
the potential fight for the chairmanship was not the only 
democratic party contest that could divide over racial lines during 
the next year 
in new york mayor ed koch who is up for reelection in 1989 
outraged blacks and many whites during the 1988 presidential primary 
campaign when he said supporters of israel would have to be 
crazy to vote for jackson 
mayoral races in chicago and los angeles also could produce 
bitter contests between black and white candidates 
while the democrats were trying to avoid battles that could 
alienate their most loyal constituency the republicans were taking 
aim at attracting more black support 
bush met with jackson and said he and the former democratic 
presidential aspirant have a relationship that transcends 
politics 
there will be times when i will ask for his suggestions 
bush said of jackson he has some very good ideas 
in turn jackson praised bush for his openness and his 
willingness to discuss a broad range of matters 
lee atwater bushs campaign manager and the presidentelects 
choice to become next republican party chairman said he would make 
a special effort in his new post to attract black voters to the gop

swiss voters on sunday rejected by 21 a proposed 
constitutional amendment that would have cut the nations 1 million 
foreign residents by almost one third in the next 15 years 
a referendum proposal to introduce a 40hour work week also was 
decisively turned down 
official returns indicated that 673 percent of the voters 
rejected the immigration measure the 40hour work week was turned 
down by 658 percent of the voters 
officials estimated turnout at 50 percent 
the immigration measure launched by the small rightwing 
national action party would have reduced the number of foreigners 
among switzerlands 65 million people from 1 million to about 
700000 by the year 2004 
supporters said this would be achieved by admitting only two new 
immigrants for every three foreigners leaving switzerland 
the plan also called for sharply cutting the number of foreign 
seasonal workers and of people working in switzerland but living in 
france italy west germany or austria 
the government this year reported a record influx of refugees 
many from third world countries seeking asylum in switzerland more 
than 13000 foreigners were expected to apply for asylum in 
switzerland this year up about 30 percent from last year 
national action claimed the proposed measure would deter 
thousands of people from seeking asylum thus saving money easing a 
housing shortage and reducing environmental burdens 
the labor proposal launched by the swiss federation of trade 
unions called for annual twohour reductions in the workweek until 
all industries reached the 40hour standard in 1999 the workweek 
now averages 425 hours but workers in catering sales or hospitals 
put in 43 to 60 hours 
the government had urged citizens to reject both draft 
amendments warning of serious economic consequences in a country 
already facing a tight labor market 
critics said the immigration measure would sap the work force in 
the construction and catering industries forcing businesses to shut 
down or move abroad they also warned of strained relations with the 
12nation european economic community switzerlands largest trading 
partner 
employers and the government argued that the proposed labor 
legislation would reduce the flexibility of unions and industries to 
negotiate the length of the work week several industries including 
watchmaking and machinery have adopted the 40hour standard or have 
pledged to introduce it 
in switzerland more than 100000 signatures were required to put 
the two referendum issues on the ballot

a showdown between british prime minister 
margaret thatcher and belgian and irish leaders over extradition of 
a proira priest marred a european economic community summit and 
plunged angloirish relations to a new low 
the eec meeting which ended saturday also displayed strains 
over the next big hurdles the 12nation trade bloc faces such a 
single tax system and free migration as it becomes a huge single 
market by 1992 
but it was the issue of patrick ryan a roman catholic priest who 
british authorities charge is linked with a string of irish 
republican army bombings that exploded into some of the angriest 
exchanges yet between the fellow west european leaders 
as with the other big diversion in rhodes the presence of greek 
prime minister andreas papandreous blonde girlfriend dimitra 
liani the other heads of government pretended not to notice 
it wasnt easy 
mrs thatcher devoted much of a news conference at the end of the 
summit saturday to renewed expressions of outrage against belgian 
prime minister wilfried martens whose government refused to 
extradite ryan and charles haughey premier of the irish republic 
where the priest is holed up with an undisclosed religious order 
it is not enough to sign ringing declarations against 
terrorism what matters is effective action she snapped we are 
at the receiving end of vicious terrorist attacks it our police it 
is our soldiers our civilians who are being maimed or killed 
nearly 3000 people have died in protestantcatholic feuding in 
britishruled northern ireland in the past 20 years 
mrs thatcher herself narrowly escaped injury or death in 1984 
when the ira blew up her hotel in brighton england and killed five 
people 
the mainly catholic guerrilla movement banned in both britain 
and ireland remains pledged to try to kill her in its drive to 
unite northern ireland with the irish republic 
haughey and martens berated in separate meetings by mrs 
thatcher refused to back down denying political motivations and 
saying they acted on purely legal grounds 
belgium where ryan was arrested in june sent him to ireland 
last week after the 58yearold priest went on hunger strike in jail 
mrs thatchers anger at the belgian action turned to fury as 
irish police let ryan disappear while the irish attorney general 
john murray ponders the extradition request 
it would be foolish to deny that this is an event of major 
signifigance in angloirish relations that has caused major fallout 
in many different directions haughey told irish journalists at 
the end of a tough session with mrs thatcher on saturday 
on friday citing personal convenience haughey canceled a 
scheduled meeting with mrs thatcher at the hotel where they were 
both staying 
not even mrs thatcher said it publicly but behind the ryan 
dispute lies an insinuation by britain a mainly protestant nation 
that belgium and ireland overwhelmingly catholic countries are 
being fainthearted because ryan is a priest 
the confrontation has thrown new strains on a 1985 accord which 
gave the republic a consultative say in the running of northern 
ireland 
to many irish the confrontation smacks of another example of 
british heavyhandedness exacerbated by what some see as mrs 
thatcher pursuit of a personal war against the ira regardless of 
diplomatic or democratic niceties

rapidly and must be replaced none has been made since april 
pentagon experts have said that if savannah river did not have 
all three reactors operating by next summer extraordinary steps 
might be needed including deactivating warheads and taking the 
tritium for higherpriority weapons 
on tuesday energy secretary john s herrington said one of the 
three reactors at the governmentoperated plant near aiken sc 
would open by spring or summer the reactors have been closed for 
safety reasons 
robert m keller a senior nuclear engineer at the energy 
department who wrote the overhaul plan said it may take until 
december 1989 to restart the first of the reactors according to the 
times the newspaper said engineers estimated that it would probably 
take until the end of 1990 to restart the others 
c anson franklin the energy departments chief spokesman said 
herrington last week was not making a firm prediction only a 
guesstimate that may or may not be validated when all the 
information is in 
franklin said a report due to be completed thursday would outline 
the schedule for putting the plan into effect and offer a firm date 
for reopening

jurors who acquitted a man of 
murdering his terminally ill wife sent a message that the infirm 
frail and dependent are not worth protecting says an opponent of 
mercy killing 
but an advocate of euthanasia who believes evidence in a trial 
was powerful enough to convict dr peter rosier said the jury simply 
put compassion over the law because the law is not humane 
although rosier did not take the stand the pathologist said in a 
tv interview and in a book that he tried to help his cancerstricken 
wife patricia 43 commit suicide two years ago to end her misery 
he gave her 20 sedatives and morphine and she lingered in a coma 
for 12 hours rosier botched the job mrs rosiers stepfather 
vincent delman told the jury so delman said he went into the 
bedroom and smothered her 
delman testified under immunity from prosecution granted before 
the state knew of his role 
defense attorney stanley rosenblatt argued rosier knew the doses 
of drugs he gave wouldnt kill prosecutors charged rosier was 
trying to cash in on a book he wrote about his wifes suffering 
the jury cleared rosier on thursday he was charged with 
firstdegree murder attempted murder and conspiracy but jurors 
also considered lesser offenses of seconddegree murder 
manslaughter aggravated battery and battery 
that jury said something tremendously cruel that the healthy 
have a right to be protected but those who are most vulnerable or 
most dependent dont have that right said rita marker head of 
the international antieuthanasia task force 
patricia rosier did not die of cancer she did not kill her 
herself her family killed her ms marker said 
derek humphry head of the proeuthanasia hemlock society sat 
through the trial and agreed rosier meant to kill his wife but 
humphry said he doesnt believe it should be a crime to help end the 
life of a terminally ill person who wants to die 
the jury said maybe hes guilty but were not going to 
convict the law is wrong he said 
not so said some jurors we were ruling on the charges we 
didnt want to get into any discussion of euthanasia said juror

tourism has increased so much at abraham 
lincolns home since it reopened after a 22 million renovation 
that some visitors have been turned away and legislators are 
seeking money for more tour guides 
weve had a terrible situation where weve actually had to turn 
away school kids who came to see the lincoln home said rep 
richard durbin dill who represents the district where the home 
is located 
durbin and sen paul simon dill are hoping to funnel an 
additional 67000 to the home for more guides during the busy 
spring and summer months next year 
this is a national treasure and it ought to be preserved 
simon said we ought to make it as accessible to the public as 
possible 
the home which was bought by lincoln in 1844 was closed in may 
1987 for a 22 million restoration to ensure its stability the 
project also included interior decorating and a new paint job in its 
historical hues the home reopened in june 
simon who has written a book about lincolns days in the 
legislature said he was impressed by the job and could understand 
the dramatic increase in the number of visitors 
the national park service which runs the site reported that 
nearly 1600 visitors were turned away between sept 4 and oct 8 
because the home was full 
from june through september 419000 people toured the home an 
85 percent increase over the same period in 1986 the number of 
visitors for all of 1986 was 440775

minimalist composer philip glass grateful dead 
percussionist mickey hart and japanese synthesizer player kitaro 
took part in a tibetan ganden ngam cho or festival of light 
saturday night at the cathedral church of st john the divine 
it was the first time western musicians participated in the music 
performed on this tibetan buddhist holiday 
by coincidence it also was the first night of hanukkah the 
jewish festival of lights 
twenty gyuto monks the gyuto tantric choir sat in two lines on 
the floor of a stage and sang nine chants the music sounded more 
like a gutteral drone than a chant with each note and syllable held 
a long time and most of it was lower than the deepest bass at a 
western opera house 
while some voices hit a low note and held it others hit tones 
just above or below the main note this gave a fullness and 
resonance but the tones were so close together it didnt sound like 
harmony 
when higher tones were held it sounded like a large choir 
singing a unison amen 
actor richard gere president of tibet house here and master of 
ceremonies said that proceeds from a tv film and recording made at 
the event will help build a gyuto buddhist monastery in nepal there 
now is one monastery in india it was built after china invaded 
tibet in 1950 and a few of the 900 gyuto buddhist monks fled to 
india 
saturday was the 25th day of the 10th lunar month the date of 
both the birth and death of tsong khapa robert thurman a professor 
at columbia university said that tsong khapa revitalized buddhism 
in tibet and started a gyuto monastery 514 years ago 
he said that the music offered on this festival makes a listener 
momentarily free of stinginess egotism anger poverty pain and 
fear and able to feel love clarity and joy 
once public performances of chants by monks were not considered 
appropriate 
glass playing organ at the back of the church kitaro playing 
synthesizer and hart with two percussion instruments in front of 
the stage where the monks sat played a 20minute piece of modified 
minimalist music before the monks chanted miles davis who was 
scheduled to play was ill and was replaced by kitaro 
thurman said the guests were invited to play because the monks 
feel that from their hearts musicians come out and play and 
celebrate truth the monks envision them as dieties making offerings 
to the buddha 
harts 360 productions and tibet house are sponsoring the monks 
us visit which began in early november on the west coast and 
continues to philadelphia boston and northampton mass

texas power is on the upswing in washington 
where lone star state clout just may eclipse those potent days when 
sam rayburn was speaker of the house and lyndon b johnson headed 
the senate 
things are looking good for us says rep jack brooks 
dtexas youve got democrats taking over congress and republicans 
taking over the administration from texas 
adopted texan george bush assumes the presidency on jan 20 
bringing with him at least two and as many as five cabinet members 
from texas house speaker jim wright who hails from fort worth is 
likely to retain his leadership post in voting this week 
james a baker iii bushs nominee for secretary of state is 
from houston while education secretary lauro cavazos the first 
hispanic member of a presidents cabinet is the son of a cowhand 
and former president of texas tech university 
the texas list goes on in congress where rep kika de la garza is 
chairman of the agriculture committee and reps brooks and henry b 
gonzalez are in line to take over the house judiciary and banking 
committees respectively 
on the republican side former texas sen john tower is under 
serious consideration for secretary of defense houston businessman 
robert mosbacher is rumored a contender for secretary of commerce 
and former congressman tom loeffer is mentioned for secretary of 
energy 
this is the first time in our history that weve had a texan as 
president and as speaker of the house and we have a number of 
texans as chairmen of committees now says sen lloyd bentsen 
himself the chairman of the senate finance committee 
ive never seen that many texans holding that many positions 
well certainly get some attention to our states concerns said 
the defeated democratic vice presidential nominee 
when youre in power youre in style and texas is back in 
style says democratic consultant george shipley of austin 
bush would break the record for texans in the cabinet if he 
appoints at least four according to george christian who served as 
press secretary to johnson from 1966 to 1969 the most texans at any 
one time in johnsons cabinet was three christian says 
historically texans have had strong leadership in washington 
but the difference is today it has a bipartisan tinge to it that it 
didnt have before says christian we have feet in both camps 
and thats an improvement 
its really a texas brigade in the north says bob mansker 
press secretary to democratic rep martin frost of dallas 
its a heady ascent for the state that some love to hate and 
brooks is warning his colleagues to avoid taking the power too 
seriously 
we cannot be smug about our leadership brooks says we 
dont know what kind of rapport you can work out with the 
administration and the problems are so big and the solutions are 
going to be tough

prime minister benazir bhutto of pakistan said 
sunday she has been too busy taking over the government to determine 
whether documents exist shedding light on the death of her 
predecessor or on pakistans nuclear capability 
we havent gone into these issues yet ms bhutto said in a 
live television interview from pakistan 
she told british interviewer david frost she has had other 
priorities since being sworn into office on friday including naming 
a cabinet which was installed on sunday 
ms bhutto 35 also revealed that unspecified complications 
resulted in her giving birth to a 7pound son on sept 21 instead of 
in october when he was due 
it was widely believed in pakistan that ms bhutto tricked 
president mohammed zia ulhaq into calling elections for nov 16 
giving her time to recover from the birth and to resume campaigning 
her family had let it be known the baby was not due until november 
or december 
i think the baby outwitted both of us ms bhutto said when 
asked whether her son was premature or whether she had outwitted 
gen zia 
the baby wasnt due until october but because of certain 
complications he arrived in september 
ms bhutto would not elaborate on the complications but said her 
son bilawal was fine 
zia died in a mysterious plane crash aug 17 after setting a date 
for pakistans first free elections in more than a decade zia 
overthrew the last civilian government led by zulfikar ali bhutto 
ms bhuttos father in 1977 and two years later ordered his 
execution 
authorities suspect sabotage in the crash and a probe is 
continuing 
ms bhutto leader of the pakistan peoples party said that when 
she took her oath of office friday she could feel her fathers 
presence and sense his pride not only in me but in the success 
of the whole party and in the success of democracy 
she said that if her father could advise her during her early 
days as prime minister first and foremost he would want me to be 
my own person because each one of us are judged on our own records 
not on the records of our famous forebearers 
ms bhutto who retained her maiden name following her arranged 
marriage to businessman asif ali zardari said that motherhood has 
meant changes 
i start my day differently she said i go and see him her 
son first thing i end my day differently because i see him last 
thing 
its really nice to have a child she said adding it 
doesnt sound very liberated but a child does give much joy 
asked whether she fears the army will attempt another coup in 
pakistan ms bhutto said one cannot live on fears one survives 
on hopes 
ms bhutto did not respond to questions of pakistans nuclear 
capacity zia maintained the country had no program for producing an 
atomic bomb and used its facilities for enriching uranium a 
process used to increase its radioacitivity only for peaceful 
purposes outside experts including us officials were skeptical

amiram nir the israeli gobetween in 
secret us arms deals with iran who died in a light plane crash 
last week told people he was in mexico to buy avocados police said 
federal authorities continued sunday to investigate both the 
plane crash and nirs visit to uruapan an outoftheway city in 
the western mountains of michoacan state famed for its avocados and 
notorious for drug trafficking 
new revelations about nirs role in the irancontra affair 
meanwhile emerged sunday in a washington post report quoting him as 
saying in june that a secret usisraeli agreement authorized 
counterterrorist operations he supervised with former white house 
aide oliver north in 198586 
nir 37 was a counterterrorism adviser to prime minister shimon 
peres and his successor yitzhak shamir 
in jerusalem the office of peres now foreign minister denied 
the washington post report sunday 
there is no such agreement foreign ministry spokesman alon 
liel said in a statement he declined to elaborate 
us secretary of state george shultz appearing on abctvs 
this week with david brinkley was asked if such an agreement 
ever existed 
not that i know of he replied 
police here said they have no evidence that nirs visit involved 
anything but avocados but they could not explain why he apparently 
decided to travel under an assumed name 
jose luis arriaga a federal judicial police commander in 
uruapan said nir spent three days at the best hotel in town and 
discussed avocado prices with a frenchowned exporter nir was 
traveling on a visa issued nov 25 in london 
he came to solicit prices for avocados arriaga said 
he said nir had planned to return to uruapan in a week possibly 
to close a deal with the exporter eupasa a local subsidiary of 
lucal france a fruit and vegetable importer based in france 
when nir left uruapan on a charter flight he registered under an 
assumed name pat weber however arriaga said nir used his own 
name at the hotel in uruapan 
arriaga said police obtained information about nirs visit from 
pedro curchet the local agent for eupasa which he said employs 
about 50 people in an avocadopacking operation in uruapan 
curchet identified nirs body in the wreckage of the aerotaxis of 
uruapan cessna t210 that went down wednesday in the mountains 
outside ciudad hidalgo about 110 miles west of mexico city 
the pilot also died and three other people were seriously 
injured one was a canadian woman adriana stanton 25 who said she 
knew nir only slightly and the others apparently were only sharing 
the chartered flight 
stanton told the associated press thursday that she did not know 
what nir was doing in mexico 
i dont know what his usual itinerary is i dont know if he 
comes to mexico a lot she said 
the mexico city daily la jornada said saturday that stanton was 
also traveling under an assumed name esther arriaga the newspaper 
did not quote a source for the information 
curchet was one of a party of about eight people from argentina 
who had been staying at the hillside hotel since september hotel 
personnel said they left thursday or friday 
they said stanton arrived before curchet and they did not know if 
she was working with him 
hotel personnel and police who interviewed curchet said the visit 
was nirs first curchet could not be located for comment and the 
offices of eupasa in uruapan were closed sunday 
arriaga said the investigation involves mexican aviation experts 
from mexico city and the international police organization interpol 
israeli embassy officials and friends of nir in israel have said 
nir was in mexico on a business trip but would not reveal the nature 
of the visit 
arriaga said he did not know if nir was acting as an independent 
buyer or as an agent for an importer abroad 
in november local avocado businessmen formed the association of 
producers and exporters to compete with the foreign exporters from 
eupasa 
federal authorities describe the region as critical to drug 
trafficking marijuana is grown clandestinely and the mountains are 
pocked wtih secret airstrips for transporting drugs

the locked gate that once guarded the 
main road into this elite community is long gone but some residents 
want their privacy back even suggesting id armbands to identify 
unwanted visitors 
the 3200 residents of the quiet wooded community outside st 
paul can legally make the world go away because everyones property 
extends to the middle of the road with no no public streets 
residents can stop outsiders at the border 
residents maintain they arent snobs rather said joan brainard 
publisher of the north oaks news and a former city council member 
we dont feel residents of other cities should willynilly be 
using our facilities 
north oaks has several lakes with beaches tennis courts hockey 
rinks and soccer and football fields 
the main entrance once had a locked gate now there are four 
entrances and homeowners association president william ecklund said 
installing security gates on them is not feasible because weve 
got too many people out there 
a recent survey by the association to which half its members 
responded found that 85 percent favor the use of id decals on 
residents cars and 69 percent said decals should be on bicycles 
too 
some have gone so far as to suggest deputizing some residents who 
could evict or arrest trespassers but the board rejected the idea 
member sharon anderson was turned off by the prospect of a 
vigilante group roaming the town 
other suggestions that havent gotten off the ground include 
issuing residents armbands or id cards 
one resident connie zmijewski said she believes the town is 
hurting itself by pushing for more privacy 
she noted that last year a proposal to increase annual homeowners 
association dues to build bicycle and walking paths was soundly 
defeated after some opponents argued that the trails would attract 
more outsiders 
id hate to see park and recreation facilities not developed 
because of our fear of others she said thats going 
backwards

this impoverished city already 
unable to pay its employees on time or afford cleaning supplies for 
city hall now is threatened with the loss of its share of state 
sales and income tax revenue 
the city was notified last week that it was 31 million in debt 
to a public employees pension program the illinois municipal 
retirement fund 
jack edman director of legal affairs for the fund said it is 
entitled to recover the back payments by having money deducted from 
tax revenue due east st louis 
the loss of the tax money would be a devastating blow to the 
city the income and sales taxes provide about 25 million of its 
68 million budget for this year 
the city across the mississippi river from st louis mo 
suffers from an eroded industrial and commercial tax base a 
predominately poor minority population and accusations of municipal 
mismanagement 
city officials were warned about the debt in a letter from the 
pension fund dated nov 29 
weve given them 30 days from the date of the letter to work 
payment out edman said if they take no action well go to the 
state comptroller and request the money be deducted 
city attorney eric vickers said saturday he was unaware of the 
threat to seize the citys state tax revenues were certainly 
going to take whatever action is necessary to prevent them from 
doing that vickers said 
the city does not have the money in the bank to pay the debt 
officials said 
in fact a purchasing official warned in a memo last week that 
the city did not even have enough money to order toilet paper and 
cleaning supplies which he said were dangerously low the st louis 
postdispatch reported sunday 
the city was able to pay its 200 employees last week only because 
treasurer charlotte r moore drove to the capitol to pick up a 
139000 check for the citys share of state income tax revenue 
employees still are one paycheck behind 
the citys debt to the pension fund has been growing steadily 
since 1979 edman said 
robert l cusma executive director of the fund said city 
retirees could be affected if we dont get the money we cant 
pay the pensions owed them he said id be quite perturbed if 
i were a city employee

expected to testify monday in a lawsuit accusing the former minister 
of nearly strangling his wife a lawyer for the wifes family says 
lucy papillon has been ordered to testify in the case said bill 
arnold the attorney for the family of peggy railey 
mrs railey was choked and left for dead in her garage in 1987 
the woman then 38 is in what doctors have described as a 
persistent vegetative state in a nursing home 
ms papillons alleged relationship with railey became known last 
year in a grand jury investigation of the attack 
railey 41 former senior minister of the first united methodist 
church has been identified by police as a suspect in the case but 
no charges have been filed prosecutors have said the matter is 
under investigation 
railey has denied trying to kill his wife and maintains he was 
working on a research project at southern methodist university at 
the time he is believed to be living in california and is not 
expected at mondays proceedings 
ms papillon a 46yearold dallas psychologist has not publicly 
discussed her relationship with railey but sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said she told a grand jury last year they had 
been lovers since 1986

railey by refusing to respond to the lawsuit technically admitted 
the charges contained in the documents 
he knowingly maliciously and brutally attempted to strangle 
his wife and cover up his actions with a false alibi the 
judge ruled 
the civil case will decide how much in damages mrs raileys 
family is to receive

this historic fishing port with its 
trawlers and luxury yachts fish processing plants and cliffside 
mansions has spent the last decade in a frustrating battle against a 
rising tide of heroin addiction 
a modest force of 51 patrolmen covers this city of 28000 people 
and 32 square miles with no more than an average share of violent 
crime breakins and drunken driving 
but up to six times a year police are called to the scene of a 
drug overdose death far more often than in other massachusetts 
cities of similar size it appears its never going to end said 
police chief earland worthley 
a man found dead in november of an apparent overdose came down 
here from malden to do it worthley said the drug is easy to find 
here he said 
in 11 years as chief worthley said there have been 20 to 25 
heroin overdose deaths drug counselor ron morin said there have 
been more than 30 in the past five years 
gloucester is a workingclass community of large closeknit 
families of frenchcanadian portuguese yankee irish and italian 
backgrounds the community saw a lot of friction years ago when 
followers of the rev sun myung moon became a major force in the 
local fishing industry 
why did heroin come to gloucester and stay 
it defies an easy simple explanation said essex county 
district attorney kevin burke 
the obvious assumption that heroin comes in by boat is incorrect 
he said it comes by car from new york city providence ri and 
chelsea a bluecollar city near boston 
morin estimated there are 300 heroin addicts in gloucester or 
roughly one resident in 100 a rate 62 percent higher than the 
statewide average as recently as 1982 there were only about 50 
gloucester addicts authorities said 
in the 1960s and 1970s heroin was prevalent among young people 
all over eastern massachusetts burke said heroin fell out of favor 
elsewhere but in gloucester it never lost its appeal 
the twoweekson twoweeksoff schedule of many fishermen is 
conducive to alcohol and drug abuse morin said a more important 
factor he said is gloucesters isolation as a workingclass 
community surrounded by wealthy seacoast communities like 
manchester ipswich and rockport 
gloucester because of its position in the middle tends to 
attract the losers from other communities morin said 
gloucesters the place where you can live in a 50aweek room 
last week burke assigned two state troopers to gloucesters 
fourmember drug task force were going to arrest as many people 
as we can who are using and abusing drugs maybe we can drive some 
folks into treatment he said 
earlier this year burkes office in what he said was a first in 
the state indicted two heroin dealers on manslaughter charges in 
the deaths of two addicts 
possibily because gloucesters heroin users are a part of a 
stable familyoriented community addiction has not brought with it 
the crime that besets other cities 
its still this little town surrounded by natural beauty and 
everybody knows everybody and nobodys living in fear and homes 
arent being broken into said phil salzman a high school teacher 
who keeps a file of drug overdose obituaries to help him dramatize 
the problem in his classes

the death toll from a cyclone that 
pounded southern bangladesh and india could surpass 2000 officials 
and news reports said sunday 
the number of people still missing ranged from 3000 to 5000 
according to newspapers and officials in the two countries 
according to the red crescent the moslem equivalent of the red 
cross at least 1115 people died in the storm in bangladesh 
a navy officer who toured some of the hardest hit areas along the 
coast put the death toll at 1300 dhaka newspapers however said 
the tally had reached 1500 and was likely to climb higher 
in indias west bengal state adjoining bangladesh the official 
death toll reached 500 on sunday 
the actual number of deaths may never be known communication is 
poor in much of the region and bureaucracy slows the reporting of 
verifiable deaths in some places 
the cyclone which roared ashore from the bay of bengal on 
tuesday devastated 30 of the 64 administrative districts in 
bangladesh and destroyed up to 70 percent of the rice crops ready 
for harvest according to a preliminary government assessment 
the government had expected to harvest 27 million tons from the 
areas struck by the cyclone 
newspapers estimated between 25 million and 5 million people 
were left homeless by the cyclone which hit mostly mudandstraw 
houses in coastal villages 
president hossain muhammad ershad told a meeting of the national 
disaster prevention council on sunday the nation must face 
cyclones and floods with courage 
the council was formed last summer after floods covered 
threefourths of the country claimed at least 1500 lives and left 
an estimated 30 million people homeless and destroyed about two 
million tons of grain 
ershad has said his government will mobilize its resources to 
help the survivors of the cyclone but the government of this 
impoverished nation of 110 million where the per capita annual 
income is 150 will be hardpressed to meet the task 
bangladesh is a victim of geography with most of the country 
barely above sea level and cyclones and floods strike with deadly 
regularity 
in 1970 more than 300000 died when a cyclone hit a 1983 
cyclone caused 10000 deaths

a cuban official said sunday that the 
sudden departure of south african diplomats derailed talks aimed at 
peace in angola and southwest africa just as an agreement was about 
to be signed 
the south african delegation left brazzaville on saturday night 
after four days of talks saying it had to consult with its 
government 
foreign minister pik botha who led the delegation said the 
talks could be resumed within a few days and a protocol signing 
is still a possibility 
but cuban amd angolan diplomats were reported to be angered by 
the surprise departure of the south africans after four days of 
talks negotiators had hoped an interim treaty would be signed on 
saturday or sunday followed by a formal treaty ceremony in new york 
the diplomats questioned south africas commitment to a 
usmediated effort to negotiate the withdrawal of 50000 cuban 
troops from angola and implementing unsponsored independence for 
southwest africa also known as namibia the territory is 
controlled by south africa 
if the south africans were truly for peace in angola and 
independence in namibia they would not have employed this diplomatic 
ruse said ricardo de quesada cubas viceminister for foreign 
affairs 
he said the diplomats were so close to agreement that the text 
already had been typed 
the south africans have insulted everyone it is 
legitimate to ask if they were negotiating seriously de quesada 
said 
he added however we think there is still a chance that we 
will find ourselves back here in brazzaville but everything depends 
on the contacts that are established by the mediator 
chester crocker us assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs has been leading the negotiations 
de quesadas angolan counterpart venancio de moura said angola 
and cuban had been very flexible but sadly we were treated 
arrogantly by the south africans 
the main obstacle to the agreeement has been the issue of how to 
verify the withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops the first of which 
arrived in angola in 1976 to support the marxist government south 
africa has insisted on a cuban pullout as a condition for granting 
independence to southwest africa also known as nambibia 
the four sides have agreed to a 27month timetable for a cuban 
withdrawal but south africa has demanded representation on the 
force monitoring the withdrawal cuba and angola have refused a 
south african presence on the monitoring commission saying the 
united nations will supervise the pullout 
the cuban troops have supported the angolan government against 
usaided rebels led by jonas savimbi supported by south african 
forces based in southwest africa 
de moura on sunday offered amnesty to the followers of the 
guerrilla leader who he said was responsible for the atrocities 
murders and destruction of the angolan economy but he said there 
was no place for savimbi in angolan society

an unlimited number of candidates for a new 
national legislature will be allowed to campaign in the official 
media at state expense early next year according to an election law 
published sunday 
publication of the law pushed through the supreme soviet 
parliament thursday by president mikhail s gorbachev gave voters 
their first look at final details of the system under which they 
will select 2250 members of a new congress of peoples deputies on 
march 26 
the soviet union last year began experimenting with allowing more 
than one candidate in some elections breaking a tradition of single 
candidates approved by authorities for their political reliability 
any number of candidates for deputy can be registered the 
new law says 
candidates for peoples deputy of the ussr from the time of 
their registration by the election commission have an equal right to 
speak at preelection and other meetings sessions and gatherings 
in the press and on television and radio it says 
the law also says that candidates do not incur expenses 
connected with preparation and carrying out of elections 
candidates may have a staff of up to 10 people should be paid their 
normal salary while they are campaigning and are allowed free public 
transportation in their district except by taxi 
while the new law seems to assure more candidates it remains an 
open question whether there would be much of a difference in their 
views 
the communist party still is enshrined in the soviet constitution 
as the guiding force of soviet society and the law specifically 
prohibits candidates from advocating any action that is against the 
constitution or laws of the soviet union 
gorbachev speaking to the supreme soviet on nov 29 said a 
possibility of a real choice is being provided 
maximum use should be made of existing possiblities to give 
every voter knowledge of the candidates try as they will they 
cant make sure that everybody will come to the meetthecandidates 
rallies gorbachev said 
so a big role is to be played here by radio television and the 
press and indeed can there be anything more revealing than public 
debates in which the candidates parry questions put forth their 
views and if you like show their worth he said 
the law does not put a limit on campaign expenditures but says a 
central election commission will be in charge of distributing 
campaign money for local disbursement 
under constitutional changes approved along with the election law 
and regarded by gorbachev as a vital part of his reform effort the 
congress has the power to choose the soviet president and also a 
smaller more active supreme soviet 
that supreme soviet will replace the 1500member body that less 
than two months ago broke its tradition of unanimously approving all 
government and communist party directives 
the congress will be made up of deputies elected from 
geographical districts ethnic homelands and from organizations such 
as the communist party unions and social organizations 
the law calls for public meetings in electoral districts to 
nominate candidates who then go before a district meeting in each 
meeting the candidate must receive the votes of at least 50 percent 
of the voters but no limit was placed on the number of candidates 
who may be endorsed 
in june 1987 more than one candidate for local councils was 
allowed in a few thousand of the countrys 52000 electoral 
districts

the government newspaper izvestia sunday published 
an article on nobel laureate joseph brodsky placing the poet who 
was once convicted as a parasite on society among this centurys 
greatest soviet writers 
two izvestia correspondents spoke briefly with the poet this fall 
in paris and attended seminars he had addressed 
brodsky who left the soviet union in 1972 for new york had only 
a few of his poems published in the soviet union until the literary 
monthly novy mir new world printed some of his works after he won 
the 1987 nobel prize for literature 
izvestia said brodsky belonged among other soviet writers who 
have won the nobel prize including ivan bunin boris pasternak 
mikhail sholokov and alexander solzhenitsyn all of whom either 
left the soviet union or were persecuted for their writings 
in the early 1960s a court convicted brodsky of parasitism 
since writing poetry was not considered an official job and 
sentenced him to hard labor 
along with the rightful feeling of patriotic pride and joy 
there is sadness the article said referring to a comment by a 
leningrad newspaper before brodskys exile that said there was no 
place in leningrad for him 
the izvestia article quoted brodsky as saying he cant imagine 
returning to leningrad as a tourist and would only be interested in 
returning to see two or three close friends but he was quoted as 
saying he doubted he would go back 
under president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
greater openness the soviet union has published works previously 
banned for political reasons 
artists such as director yuri lyubimov who left the country 
because of government restrictions on their work are returning to 
stage new productions or to perform

chinas top diplomat said monday that his visit to 
the soviet union was the first step toward thawing three decades of 
chilly relations 
we both believe a summit is possible but we still have to talk 
about a specific date foreign minister qian qichen told reporters 
upon arriving at the beijing airport we must make serious 
preparations 
qian flew from tokyo where he had briefed japanese officials on 
his threeday visit to moscow that ended saturday 
qians visit to moscow during which he held two hours of talks 
with soviet president mikhail gorbachev and more than six hours of 
talks with foreign minister eduard shevardnadze was the first by a 
chinese foreign minister since 1957 
he invited shevardnadze to visit beijing early next year but said 
an exact date was not set 
both sides have said that a summit between gorbachev and senior 
chinese leader deng xiaoping could take place in the first half of 
1989 chinese and soviet sources agree late april or may is the most 
likely time 
the most important result was we started the normalization 
process qian told reporters as he walked from the plane to a 
waiting limousine 
he said talks focused on normalizing relations and the main 
obstacle sovietallied vietnams 10year occupation of cambodia 
china maintains that soviet aid is essential to the vietnamese 
occupation and wants moscow to pressure vietnam to pull out 
qian said the soviet union had agreed to do so asked if this was 
a new position on moscows part he said you can understand it 
that way 
both china and the soviet union should play a role he added 
qian said he and the soviets discussed in general terms a 
timetable for vietnamese withdrawal and came closer together on this 
issue he refused to elaborate china has said the vietnamese should 
pull out as soon as possible 
asked if all differences over cambodia had to be resolved before 
a summit was possible qian said simply we must continue 
discussions 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 and toppled the 
chineseallied khmer rouge which had killed an estimated 1 million 
fellow cambodians in an effort to purge the country of all modern 
influences china is the main supporter of a guerrilla coalition 
including the khmer rouge fighting the vietnamese 
chinas two other requirements for normalizing relations with 
moscow are a soviet withdrawal from afghanistan and reduction of 
soviet troops along the chinese border the soviet union has pulled 
half of its more than 100000 troops out of afghanistan but halted 
the process recently 
it has cut slightly its troop presence in allied mongolia 
adjoining china and china and the soviet union have resolved part 
of their border dispute 
the communist giants were close allies in the 1950s but split in 
the early 1960s because of ideological and strategic differences 
between mao tsetung and nikita khruschev troops clashed along the 
border in 1969 
trade cultural and other nonpolitical exchanges have grown 
rapidly in the past few years as both countries have focused less on 
ideology and more on economic development

province of the serbian republic on sunday rejected calls by 
serbias leaders to condemn recent mass rallies in the region

by the ethnic albanian majority in the province 
the rallies were staged to protest the resignation of two ethnic 
albanian leaders of the province who were forced to resign under 
pressure 
serbian communist leader slobodan milosevic is seeking to curtail 
the autonomy of kosovo to protect the slav minority allegedly 
persecuted by ethnic albanians who make up a 90 percent of kosovos 
population 
serbian leaders also insist that the demonstrations were 
counterrevolutionary a qualification apparently rejected by 
sundays session in pristina the capital of kosovo

the final days

the treaty that allowed the world organization to locate in new 
york generally prohibits the united states from imposing any 
impediment to the entry of those having business with the un 
shultz acknowledged 
but we carefully preserved our right to exclude people who we 
think threaten the security interests of the united states shultz 
said on abcs this week with david brinkley 
do we have the right to exclude anybody that the un invites 
the answer to that is clearly yes we do shultz continued 
and then second within the scope of that reservation given our 
law was it proper to exclude arafat on the grounds of terrorism and 
terrorisms relationship to our security and i think the answer to 
that is yes 
shultz said he is comfortable with the decision he made a week 
earlier to bar arafat even though only israel backed the united 
states when his move was condemned on a vote in the un general 
assembly 
i live in the united states and im secretary of state for the 
united states and i was very pleased to hear what i think around 
68 senators of the united states had to say the secretary said 
sixtyeight senators and senatorselect of both parties signed a 
letter hailing shultzs decision 
newsweek magazine meanwhile cited unidentified us 
intelligence sources as saying that palestinian hardliners perhaps 
led by the popular front for the liberation of palestine planned 
terrorist attacks in new york if arafat spoke at the united nations 
the hardliners newsweek said viewed arafats speech as too 
conciliatory the early draft of the speech refrained from 
explicitly recognizing israel but talked in general terms of israeli 
and palestinian states working together newsweek said 
the secretary of state was asked why he would allow nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega whose government the united states opposes 
to come to the un 
there is a law in the united states that finds the plo to be a 
terrorist organization and denies visas to members of the plo he 
replied there is no such law having to do with nicaragua

a judge on sunday sentenced an americanborn 
immigrant to three years in prison for the shooting death of an arab 
shepherd who brought his sheep to graze near a jewish settlement in 
the occupied west bank 
the jerusalem court last week convicted israel zeev of 
manslaughter in the fatal may shooting it was the first time a 
jewish civilian was convicted in the death of an arab since the 
start of the nearly yearlong palestinian uprising 
zeev 38 a chicago native who moved to israel more than 20 years 
ago also was convicted of shooting and seriously injuring a second 
arab 
in the occupied territories sunday troops raided five west bank 
villages and rounded up suspected arab protesters arab reports 
said at least eight palestinians most of them teenagers were shot 
and wounded in scattered clashes hospital officials said 
a military spokesman said he was checking the reports 
in the west bank town of hebron a hand grenade thrown at an 
israeli public bus exploded on the road and caused no injuries the 
army said it exploded on the road causing no injuries or damage 
suspects were arrested the israeli news agency itim said 
the 15 million palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip have been engaged in a revolt against israeli rule since dec 
8 1987 israel captured the gaza strip from egypt and the west bank 
from jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
eleven israelis and 318 palestinians have been killed in the 
uprising 
of the eight arabs wounded sunday five were shot in the occupied 
gaza strip two were wounded in nablus the largest city in the 
occupied west bank and one was shot in the west bank village of 
awarta hospital officials said 
in annexed east jerusalem district court judge zvi cohen 
sentenced zeev to a twoyear suspended sentence in addition to three 
years in prison and ordered him to pay the family of the dead arab 
28yearold jude abdallah awad about 17500 in compensation the 
sum is the maximum amount allowed by israeli law 
zeevs defense attorney jacob weinroth said he would probably 
appeal the conviction 
all along the main thing that has bothered my client in 
principle was the fact that he killed a man weinroth said 
after zeevs sentencing settlers from shilo 18 miles north of 
jerusalem rose to shake his hand 
zeev wearing jeans and the large knitted skullcap that is a 
trademark of observant jews said nothing but appeared somewhat 
relieved 
fellow settlers said they objected to the sentence claiming zeev 
was merely doing his duty guarding the settlement and should have 
been tried in a military rather than civil court they vowed to 
raise the compensation money arabs said district court judge zvi 
cohens sentence was too light 
the sentence is very light said odeh rantisi former deputy 
mayor of ramallah north of jerusalem this means disrespect for 
life given by god this is the law of the jungle where the strong 
kill the weak 
the maximum sentence for manslaughter is 20 years but zeev said 
the arab shepherds ignored his orders to leave the area and hurled 
rocks at him when he fired warning shots in the air 
zeev in jail for seven months since the killing occurred will 
have that period deducted from his sentence and will probably 
qualify to get onethird of the term reduced for good behavior 
weinroth said he could be eligible for parole in 19 months

the soviet union may raise the issue of human 
rights in britain during next weeks talks between president mikhail 
gorbachev and prime minister margaret thatcher a soviet spokesman 
said sunday 
i think simply a human rights question is a twoway street and 
charity begins at home said soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
gennady i gerasimov in an interview from new york with independent 
television news if you discuss our human rights problems we can 
also raise certain questions 
gerasimov was interviewed after the mail on sunday a weekly 
tabloid said the soviets would attack britains human rights 
record especially in dealing with irish terrorism suspects 
the tabloid which supports mrs thatchers conservative 
government said gorbachev had authorized a propaganda blitz 
that could include a meeting with families of irish people convicted 
of bombings in britain the irish republican army is waging a 
military campaign to oust the british from northern ireland and 
reunite it with the irish republic 
however gerasimov said the soviets had no plans to embarrass 
mrs thatcher over the human rights issue during gorbachevs dec 
1214 visit on his threenation tour 
before going to britain gorbachev is to arrive in new york on 
tuesday and in cuba on friday 
during mrs thatchers visit to the soviet union last year she 
held talks with dissident nobel prize winner andrei sakharov and 
gave gorbachev at list of individual human rights cases of concern 
to britain 
mrs thatchers aides said the prime minister normally raises 
human rights issues in the soviet union when she meets gorbachev and 
would probably do so during next weeks meeting 
british commentators said that if gorbachev raises the cases of 
irish men and women jailed for fatal pub bombings in birmingham 
woolwich and guildford in 1974 mrs thatcher will tell him that 
their rights have been protected in a series of trials and appeals 
chris mullin a lawmaker from the opposition labor party who has 
led a campaign to prove the innocence of the convicted people said 
he was writing to soviet ambassador leonid zamyatin to offer to 
arrange for gorbachev to be briefed on the cases 
i welcome the news that mr gorbachev may raise with mrs 
thatcher the case of the six innocent men convicted of the 
birmingham pub bombings and the total of 11 innocent people 
convicted in connection with the guildford and woolwich pub 
bombings he said 
patrick mcilkenny the brother of one of the men convicted in the 
birmingham bombings said a meeting with gorbachev would give an 
extra boost to his brothers spirits independent television news 
reported mcilkenny recently visited moscow and met one of 
gorbachevs senior foreign affairs advisers 
the six men were convicted of two ira pub bombings that killed 21 
people a total of seven died in the attacks in guilford and

soviet officials and afghan 
guerrillas met in a saudi mountain resort on sunday the second day 
of negotiations on ending the 9yearold war 
the meeting in taif is believed to include discussions on a 
ceasefire and establishment of an interim government to replace the 
current sovietbacked regime 
the talks mark the first time the soviets and the sevengroup 
guerrilla alliance sat down together since soviet troops were sent 
to afghanistan in 1979 
the official saudi press agency issued a terse statement saying 
the talks began but provided no details 
the official talks began saturday between the delegations led by 
guerrilla leader burhanuddin rabbani and yuri vorontsov a soviet 
deputy foreign minister recently named ambassador to afghanistan 
they resumed before noon sunday in the town 600 miles southwest 
of the saudi capital of riyadh 
rabbani heads the alliance of the seven afghan resistance groups 
based in peshawar pakistan 
the guerrillas backed by pakistan and the united states were 
not a party to the unmediated geneva accords under which the 
soviets pledged to withdraw an estimated 100000 troops from 
afghanistan by feb 15 
the first half have been withdrawn on schedule but moscow 
suspended the withdrawal because the guerrillas continued to fight 
soviet troops and the kabul government

the soviet union brought four hijackers back from 
israel sunday and declared the success of a bargaining strategy that 
gained the safe release of 30 children and the return of the gunmen 
and their plane 
the hijackers arrived at moscows sheremetyevo 1 airport before 
dawn sunday ending a drama that began when they commandeered a 
school bus in the southern russian city of ordzhonikidze on thursday 
vremya the soviet television evening news program showed two 
bound hijackers being hustled off a plane at the airport early 
sunday and into waiting cars they returned with the hijacked 
ilyushin 76t transport plane and a special tupolev 154 jet sent to 
israel for them 
during the affair soviet authorities gave the hijackers weapons 
drugs and money to gain the release of the fourthgrade pupils and 
worked with israel with which moscow broke diplomatic ties 21 years 
ago 
the outcome of the operation will serve as a warning to those 
who may nurture this kind of criminal designs tass quoted a kgb 
secret police spokesman as saying 
it is for the first time that such an operation has been 
carried out with the participation of another state and its results 
can be described as successful the criminals have been captured 
they will sustain a deserved punishment and what is the main thing 
the children were rescued he was quoted as saying 
tass said the decision to negotiate to save the children was 
the only right decision 
the soviet strategy was in sharp contrast to tactics used in the 
last known hijacking in march when soldiers stormed a plane held by 
members of a family jazz band from the siberian city of irkutsk 
in that incident five of the hijackers three other passengers 
and a stewardess died in the assault and much of the plane was 
reduced to ashes by a bomb set off by the hijackers some soviet 
papers later questioned whether force had been necessary 
reports in the staterun media sunday detailed the operation to 
save the children their teacher and a bus driver and the decision 
to give the hijackers a plane and eight crew members as hostages 
but they did not say what charges the four would face or where 
they were being held tass indicated that a fifth person the wife 
of the man identified as the ringleader probably would not be 
charged 
it said 29yearold tamara fotaki was a virtual hostage herself 
and accompanied the hijackers onto the plane in the discharge of 
her civic duty for the sake of saving the lives of the 30 school 
children and their teacher media reports identified the leader of 
the gang as 38yearold pavel yakshiyants who was convicted three 
times for robberies and theft geni ageyev a deputy kgb chairman 
described him as a hardened habitual criminal tass said 
another was identified as 26yearold v muravlev a former 
electrician with two previous convictions 
the government newspaper izvestia said the schoolchildren had 
been on a field trip to a printing plant when the hijackers captured 
them 
at the exit near the gate they saw a bus the driver 
hospitably opened wide the doors and said they sent us for you 
the children not thinking entered the bus and all the rest 
developed like a detective story izvestia said 
the hijackers took the bus to the nearby city of mineralnye vody 
from where they took off for israel 
pravda the communist party newspaper said the hijackers 
gradually released children as demands were met for vinegar 
apparently to dissolve drugs medicine guaranteeing a high and 
weapons 
negotiations were led by evgeny sheremetyev a kgb official from 
nearby stavropol soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs home area 
after their demands were met for a large quantity of foreign 
currency the hijackers held only 11 of the children hostage pravda 
said sheremetyev then offered himself in exchange for the rest and 
was forced to lie on the floor of the bus while the plane was 
prepared for the hijackers 
tass said the flight crew had been scheduled for a routine flight 
to new dehli india from moscow and only learned of the hijacking 
when they arrived in mineralnye vody

hundreds of heavily armed soldiers 
agreed to give up their guns and surrender on sunday ending a 
fourday military revolt the government said at least four people 
were reported killed in the uprising 
the army said in a communique that the 500 insurgents who had 
been holed up at a military base just outside the capital agreed to 
give up their weapons and explosives 
but the government news agency telam reported that some rebels 
still had refused to surrender at the base and that some rebels 
still laid siege to another military installation at mercedes 60 
miles west of buenos aires 
at least three civilians and one policeman were killed and 35 
people wounded during a clash sunday between hundreds of antirebel 
demonstrators and the insurgents radio rivadavia reported sunday 
president raul alfonsin facing the worst threat since his 
civilian government replaced military rule in 1983 denied that any 
deals were made with the rebels 
the rebels had demanded an overhaul in the military hierarchy a 
bigger military budget and an end to prosecutions for human rights 
abuses committed during the 197683 military dictatorships 
this has been a really important success alfonsin told 
reporters at government house there were no concessions of any 
kind 
but a spokesman for the opposition peronist party requested a 
detailed briefing by defense minister horacio jaunarena about how 
the settlement was achieved 
earlier the private noticias argentinas and diarios y noticias 
news agencies said army chief lt gen jose dante caridi had agreed 
to a rebel demand that he resign both agencies cited political and 
military sources 
the government did not negotiate on an amnesty changes of 
human rights trials or any claim by anyone sen antonio 
berhongaray chairman of the defense committee said 
democracy triumphed said a message flashed across the screen 
by the five tv stations that had been broadcasting simultaneous news 
of the revolt for nearly 24 hours 
the rebel leader col mohamed ali seineldin was arrested and 
the approximately 500 rebels he commanded began to lay down their 
weapons the army said 
soldiers immediately began to remove mines and fill in trenches 
made by the rebels to defend their positions at the seized villa 
martelli base on the outskirts of the city 
alfonsin had wide support to quell the rebellion and pledged to 
suffocate it but government troops repeatedly refused to attack 
or restrict the rebels movements 
one government military officer gen adolfo patricio etcheun 
said he and his men agreed with seineldins demands and would not 
take up arms against the rebels etcheun commands the 4th air 
transport infantry brigade 
the deaths and injuries sunday occurred outside the entrance of 
the villa martelli base about nine miles outside the capital radio 
rivadavia said as loyal troops outside withdrew hundreds of 
progovernment demonstrators converged on the entrance throwing 
firebombs rocks and bottles it said 
rebels fired back from inside the arsenal and from two cars that 
sped from the scene the government news agency telam reported 
with some government officials calling the revolt a coup attempt 
officials on saturday called on the public to rally for democracy 
tens of thousands poured into the streets nationwide 
the insurrection began thursday when 53 members of an elite coast 
guard unit robbed an arsenal and deserted their base officers tried 
to incite troops at two other army bases in suburban buenos aires 
on friday about 400 troops led by seineldin rebelled at an 
infantry school at the huge campo de mayo base about 22 miles 
northwest of buenos aires 
loyal government troops traded weapons fire with the rebels on 
friday and five people were reported wounded 
but government guns were silent on saturday when most of the 
troops at campo de mayo boarded army trucks and moved to the nearby 
villa martelli an arsenal equipped with tanks and explosives 
the movement by rebel troops without interference from loyalist 
soldiers sparked fears that the insurgency was spreading 
in buenos aires a city of 10 million five television stations 
broadcast public messages urging people to defend democracy 
the insurrection was reported to have been triggered by the 
planned resumption of trials of military officers implicated in a 
wave of officially sanctioned terror during the grim years of 
juntarun military dictatorships 
a commission appointed by alfonsin said nearly 9000 argentines 
were arrested by security forces and presumed killed 
in december 1985 a civilian court convicted nine former military 
junta members including former presidents jorge videla and roberto 
viola of human rights abuses 
such trials were the impetus for similiar military uprisings in 
april 1987 and january 1988 the revolts were quelled by alfonsins 
government 
alfonsin became president in 1983 after the military junta 
beleaguered by a horrendous economy and the humiliating defeat by 
britain in the 1982 battle over the falkland islands allowed 
democratic elections

the elevation of john sununu and george 
mitchell two american politicians of partial lebanese heritage 
has instilled pride in arabamericans wherever they congregate from 
the docks of seattle and assembly lines of detroit to the halls of 
academia and the conference rooms of washington 
the process of exclusion that we suffered is now broken said 
james zogby executive director of the lobbying group arab american 
institute as he welcomed the election of democrat mitchell as senate 
majority leader and the selection by presidentelect george bush of 
republican sununu as his white house chief of staff sununus term 
as governor of new hampshire ends in early january 
weve managed to remove the taint attached to us and mature as 
a community much like the hispanics and asians said zogby 
unlike hispanics asians and other minorities the estimated 25 
million arabamericans carry the burden of antipathy toward their 
ethnic group attitudes toward them have been affected by the 
arabisraeli conflict and the strong support israel enjoys in 
congress 
sununu whose grandfather was lebanese and who has been active in 
the national association of arab americans learned this political 
lesson the hard way 
his selection by bush drew anxious reactions from the jewish 
community because of his refusal to endorse a proclamation 
condemning a united nations resolution that pronounced israel a 
racist country among the nations 50 governors sununu was the only 
one to take that stand he argued such issues were not within a 
governors domain 
sununu apologized at a news conference in washington after his 
selection by bush saying he should have signed the petition he 
later met with jewish leaders to reassure them of his support for 
israel 
he has long been aware of the pitfalls of public proarab stands 
at a keynote address to the 1984 convention of the naaa which 
adopted a resolution calling for a cutoff of american aid to israel 
he exhorted the participants to engage in political activity to 
mimic the opposition 
without naming the powerful proisrael lobby sununu talked about 
others with perspectives very different from us who have 
influenced the decisionmaking process in this country to the 
detriment of this nations foreign policy 
but he did not go beyond that an example arabamerican leaders 
say of the caution he has found it prudent to exercise 
thats how he and mitchell got where they are said james 
abourezk a former democratic senator from south dakota who is of 
arab parentage he heads the americanarab antidiscrimination 
committee 
mitchell was supported by jewish voters in maine in his 1982 and 
1988 senate races but he has also been quietly involved in arab 
causes such as the american task force on lebanon arabamerican 
organizations rallied behind his candidacy for the senate leadership 
post 
the task force in which sununu was also active is composed of 
american businessmen and politicians seeking to promote a peaceful 
solution to lebanons crisis and foster economic rehabilitation for 
the shattered country 
people of lebanese descent constitute the largest group of 
arabamericans their forebears began migrating here at the turn of 
the century 
sununu and mitchell arent alone rep mary rose oakar dohio 
also of lebanese descent is running for the chairmanship of the 
house democratic caucus 
dozens of arabamericans hold federal state and mayoral offices 
around the country among them eva sayegh tieg virginias 
secretary of human services tommy hazouri the mayor of 
jacksonville fla antony solomon state treasurer of rhode island 
michael baroody assistant secretary of labor in the reagan 
administration 
theyre openly identifying themselves as arabamericans said 
zogby whereas a few years ago they wouldnt have mentioned it at 
all 
jesse jackson the first black leader to make a serious run for 
the presidency gave arabamericans a prominent role in his campaign 
and championed one of their causes the creation of a palestinian 
homeland 
the recent political successes of arabamericans have come from 
the political mainstream rather than the fringe sununu is a 
conservative with impeccable republican credentials mitchell is an 
integral part of the political and social establishment often 
riding with bush on his airplane from washington to their homes in 
maine 
in recent years arabamericans have been organizing in labor 
unions as an ethnic group yemenite longshoremen in the west coast 
port of seattle lebanese shiite autoworkers in detroit and syrian 
steelworkers in pennsylvania 
they point with pride to such prominent americans as beverly 
hills disc jockey casey kasem and consumer advocate ralph nader 
theres a growing desire of arabamericans to identify with 
their heritage said faris bouhafa spokesman of the arabamerican 
antidiscrimination committee a civil rights and lobbying group 
for too long arabs were stereotyped and tainted in this 
country now were pointing to our past with pride teaching our 
children arabic he said 
besides providing a morale boost to the arabamerican community 
its leaders hope their political successes will help change what 
they view as a skewed us policy in the middle east 
sununu and mitchell will be less susceptible to the 
heavyhanded tactics of the proisrael lobby said bouhafa 
but former sen abourezk cautioned that both men may be too 
politically vulnerable to publicly adopt proarab stands whatever 
they may believe in their hearts

former president carlos andres perez 
was elected to a fiveyear term on sunday returning to the office 
he held a decade ago by focusing on the prosperity of the past 
the supreme electoral council declared that perez based on small 
early returns would win the election over his main opponent 
conservative eduardo fernandez of the social christian party 
perez previously served from 1974 to 1979 by law a president 
may not to return to office for 10 years 
perez 66 is to succeed president jaime lusinchi also a member 
of the democratic action party 
the victory gives the leftofcenter party two consecutive 
victories during this wealthy oilexporting nations worst economic 
crisis in decades 
perez also becomes the first president to win a second term since 
the ouster of military rule in 1958 
this is the point of departure for building a bigger venezuela 
the next government must take advantage of our situation to form the 
bases for future growth perez said on national television 
fernandez 48 conceded defeat within minutes after the councils 
announcement 
i offer perez constructive but firm opposition that will put 
the interests of venezuela above particular interests fernandez 
said on television 
the first report from the elections council based on only 1919 
votes gave perez 914 votes or 476 percent it said fernandez had 
811 votes or 422 percent the elections council however declared 
perez the winner 
perez was forecast the winner hours earlier by the major 
television networks which gave the former president a huge lead 
based on exit polls 
venevision projected nearly 39 million votes for perez or 541 
percent to 27 million for fernandez or 337 percent 
no official tallies were given on the outcome of voting for the 
allnew national congress of 182 deputies and 44 senators but the 
private networks projected the democratic action party would win 
486 percent and the social christians 263 percent in both houses 
voting is mandatory in venezuela but private projections 
projected that 15 percent of the 9 million eligible voters did not 
cast ballots 
a high abstention rate was widely predicted because of general 
voter dissatisfaction with both major candidates 
perez is closely identified with the good economic times of the 
1970s when the arab oil embargo helped stimulate rapid growth and 
prosperity he nationalized foreign oil holdings in venezuela during 
his presidency 
his previous fiveyear term was dogged by charges of corruption 
however 
perez a charismatic figure popular with the working class 
favors tighter state control over the economy fernandez favors a 
freer market 
there are 23 other presidential candidates on the ballot but 
none was given a chance to beat either of the two big parties 
lusinchis fiveyear term was one of economic decline in a 
country battered by the drop in oil prices oil makes up 90 percent 
of the countrys exports 
the new president to be inaugurated in february will face 
growing poverty in what has been latin americas richest nation the 
standard of living is still one of the highest in the region but it 
has been reduced by inflation and devaluations since 1982 
since 1984 the nations income from oil was halved to an 
expected 71 billion this year while foreign debt payments have 
continued at a rate of about 5 billion a year during lusinchis 
term the debt stands at 33 billion 
the depressed economic climate helped lead to one of the most 
unenthusiastic campaigns in venezuelas 30 years of democracy 
public rallies drew mainly the party faithful 
in addition to their financial woes voters have also been 
disenchanted with widesread corruption in government and the 
perception that neither perez nor fernandez will do anything about 
it 
perez promised price controls and wage increases he also called 
for selective economic growth by pushing nonoil exports such as 
gold aluminum and steel

salinas gave michoacan state gov luis martinez villacina a new 
job as director of federal toll highways and bridges the excelsior 
news service reported saturday as such he will be in charge of 
collecting tolls on federal highways

halls on nov 26 to demand the ouster of martinez villacina he 
belongs to the governing institutional revolutionary party 
the protestors from the national democratic front a coalition 
that supported cuauhtemoc cardenas for president said martinez

lopez paredes we set off firecrackers and danced we had a 
party

higher oil prices from opecs latest accord should 
spur the development of new north sea oilfields that british 
companies now find too expensive to exploit analysts say 
but the agreement may have little overall effect on the british 
economy despite the fact that britain is one of the worlds major 
oil producers 
the 13member organization of petroleum exporting countries 
reached an oil output agreement last week aimed at boosting crude 
oil prices by at least 40 percent in 1989 the sixmonth accord 
which takes effect in january sets a total output level of 185 
million barrels a day and a target price of 18 a barrel 
the analysts said there was no chance that britain would join 
other nonopec producers including mexico and norway in 
cooperating with opec by voluntarily cutting back production 
norway the other major north sea oil producer has told britain 
it plans to continue a voluntary 75 percent production cut it 
imposed last year even though its production is rising because of 
new fields coming into operation said a government source speaking 
on condition he was not identified 
this conservative government weve got at the moment is very 
hostile to opec said fergus macleod energy analyst at barclays 
de zoete wedd ltd i think a labor government would consider 
cooperating with opec along the lines of norway but not under 
margaret thatcher 
he said the major impact of the opec agreement will be higher 
average oil prices in 1989 than would otherwise be the case and a 
greater confidence that oil prices will not stabilize in single 
digits 
that means that some of the north sea developments which are 
marginal at current oil prices are likely to go ahead macleod 
said 
gareth lewisdavies an edinburghbased analyst for the 
investment firm county natwest woodmac said a high oil price is 
good for oil companies and that means some new developments which 
were uneconomic are now going to be economic 
the department of energy said it had approved the development of 
24 new fields at an investment cost of more than 5 billion in 1988 
a record number 
its good news said lewisdavies but these are generally 
small fields and the amount of oil is getting less and less 
britain now produces about 23 million barrels a day and ranks as 
the worlds seventh largest oil producer behind the soviet union 
the united states saudi arabia iraq china and iran he said 
this would make one believe that higher oil prices would benefit 
britain lewisdavies said but because oil plays such a small part 
in the economy lower oil prices are more beneficial to the majority 
of business and industry 
the critical thing he said is whether the united kingdom 
is an oil country and whether sterling is a petrocurrency and the 
answer i think is no 
only a very small percentage of britains gross domestic 
product is derived from oil similarly capital investment in oil is 
only a small percentage of the whole so a low oil price has helped 
the rest of britains nonoil economy he said 
the opec agreement will have little impact on britains trade 
deficit and inflation rate said bill martin chief economist at the 
investment firm phillips and drew ltd 
even a 5 hike in oil prices would only cut britains expected 
28 billion current account deficit in 1988 by about 925 million 
and add a 025 percentage point to the inflation rate which is now 
at 64 percent he said the current account includes invisible 
trade such as services 
this is not significant martin said 
the analysts agreed that the major impact on north sea production 
had been the july explosion and fire on occidental petroleums piper 
alpha platform in the north sea which killed 167 people 
the disaster took a major oilfield out of operation which 
lewisdavies said has resulted in a 16 percent drop in expected 1988 
production 
oil production in britain is not readily affected by the price 
of oil the reason being that the price of producing in the north 
sea is way below the price at the moment he said 
a recent county natwest woodmac survey found that 95 percent of 
british oil production costs less than 740 a barrel including 
about 60 percent which costs 370 or less he said 
brent crude the main blend of north sea oil was selling for 
1450 a barrel on friday

after months of criticizing opec 
overproduction that crippled its oil income mexico applauded the 
cartels new production accord and planned a reduction in its own 
exports that may help make the pact work 
were ready to collaborate with other independents and work 
with opec to strengthen the market energy department spokesman 
alfredo cortina said 
an opec team will visit mexico shortly to negotiate reductions 
energy secretary fernando hiriart said mexico was willing to cut its 
135 millionbarrel daily production to help shore up world market 
prices 
the agreement reached last week by the 13nation organization of 
petroleum exporting countries calls for a cartel export ceiling of 
185 million barrels daily roughly 4 million barrels below 
estimated current production 
still mexico is wary of opecs ability to discipline itself and 
is not banking on any miraculous recovery in global markets 
president carlos salinas de gortaris first budget to be 
presented to the nations congress dec 15 assumes target prices 
for mexican oil of only 10 per barrel according to foreign 
economists 
the budget also projects a small export cut to 13 million 
barrels per day in 1989 according to the financial newspaper el 
financiero and economists 
that would put projected oil income for the year to just under 5 
billion if prices rise to 1225 a barrel mexico would earn 
another 1 billion 
any market improvement would prove a windfall for an economy 
struggling to cope with a 102 billion foreign debt 
mexico the worlds sixthlargest oil producer is not a member 
of opec but usually followed the cartels pricing and production 
guidelines 
but when prices for mexican crudes dropped to around 9 a barrel 
hiriart announced mexico was abandoning that policy he said 
overproduction by cartel members had rendered its market quotas 
useless 
mexico had reason for threatening to go it alone former 
president miguel de la madrids 1988 budget was based on oil prices 
staying at 15 a barrel and earning 71 billion for the year by 
july energy department officials acknowledged mexico had lost 2 
billion in anticipated revenues 
at current prices total 1988 oil income will reach 55 billion 
well below 1987s 86 billion figure according to the center for 
private sector economic studies 
the government says oil generated 47 billion between january 
and august just over half that earned by nonoil exports while a 
newly diversified export base cushioned the shortfall it hasnt 
been enough to prevent mexico from running a monthly trade deficit 
since september 
depressed market prices and rising international interest rates 
acted like a vise on mexicos ability to meet its 1988 debt service 
of 14 billion each 1 drop in the price of oil deprives mexico of 
500 million in revenue while interest rate hikes of 1 percent add 
another 750 million to its debt bill 
reduced oil income also contributed to a drain on foreign 
reserves currently used to support an antiinflationary peso 
currency freeze against the dollar mexican reserves plummeted from 
16 billion in april to below 10 billion in october according to 
private estimates 
salinas pledged to link mexicos debt servicing to its oil 
earnings trade concessions abroad or both mexican officials plan 
to use the weak petroleum market as an added bargaining chip when 
rescheduling negotiations begin early next year 
we dont expect oil prices to fall by much in 1989 but if they 
do the new mexican authorities will try to neutralize the impact 
with more borrowing or by suspending or reducing debt servicing 
said abel beltran del rio executive director of the consulting firm 
ciemexwefa 
de la madrid dealt with the oil shock by absorbing it through 
less growth and more austerity del rio said under the new 
administration it wont be absorbed but neutralized 
while displaying a tough negotiating posture on the debt front 
mexico has chosen to adopt a newly conciliatory tone towards opec 
producers hiriarts offer to reduce mexican exports indicated that 
mexico views the opec pact as an opportunity it can ill afford to 
lose

harris corp which recently bought the 
semiconductor business of general electric co has laid off 280 
workers and offered severance packages to thousands of other 
employees 
the layoffs which total about 4 percent of the 6500 workers at 
harris government systems sector here were hastened by the 
hightech companys loss of a contract t develop the tracking and 
data relay satellite system ground terminal for nasa 
but company spokesman james murphy said the firings announced 
friday were the result of the slowdown in expected military business 
securities analysts have speculated at least 800 jobs would be 
eliminated overall in the first wave of layoffs following harris 
206 million purchase of ges solid state semiconductor business 
the semiconductor division lost 30 million in the year ended 
june 30 and 119 million in the following quarter 
the merger completed nov 30 made harris the nations 
sixthlargest semiconductor company 
shearson lehman hutton inc telecommunications analyst maria 
lewis said she expected harris to announce one or more plant 
closings early next year and a staff reduction of at least 10 
percent 
the companys semiconductor operation employing 8000 people is 
based here and has facilities in findlay ohio mountaintop pa 
and santa clara calif the corporation employs 33000 worldwide 
mergers of this magnitude inevitably involve substantial 
organizational changes and adjustments to head count said jon e 
cornell senior vice president of harris semiconductor sector 
the layoffs are mostly a reflection of harris managements 
reluctance to sacrifice profits for the payroll ms lewis said 
noting that john t hartley chairman and chief executive officer 
has pledged to stockholders to keep profits rising at doubledigit 
rates even while sales gains are modest

the chairman of sundstrand corp is 
stepping down less than two months after the company agreed to pay a 
record 1273 million in fines for overcharging the government on 
defense contracts 
evans w erikson 62 once listed by forbes magazine as one of 
the most powerful industrial executives in the nation said friday 
he is retiring from the aerospaceproducts manufacturer to pursue 
personal interests 
erikson a 36year veteran of sundstrand will leave the company 
at the end of december 
eriksons positions as chairman and chief executive officer will 
be split between two of his top deputies 
don r ohare 66 vice chairman through eriksons eight years in 
command moves up to chairman while harry c stonecipher 52 
president and chief operating officer who came to sundstrand from 
general electric co two years ago will serve as chief executive 
officer 
in a separate release issued at the same time erikson announced 
he has promoted corporate treasurer paul donovan 41 who joined the 
company in june to vice president of finance 
now that the company has resolved the criminal investigation of 
its government contracting practices it is an appropriate time for 
me to pursue personal interests erikson said in a statement 
assistant us attorney keith syfert said a grand jury is still 
considering possible indictments against some company officials he 
declined to say if eriksons resignation is related to the 
investigation 
sundstrand which manufactures electronic mechanical and 
hydraulic systems for the government and civilian aerospace 
industries has 14500 employees at 19 sites in various states 
in an apparently unrelated move the company also confirmed that 
it had laid off another 32 office employees as part of a 
restructuring move that has been going on for the past year 
the company said that more than 300 whitecollar employees have 
been laid off since last december 
in its recent thirdquarter report to stockholders sundstrand 
warned them to brace for a possible 392 million in penalties the 
federal government might levy on top of the 127 million the company 
has already agreed to pay 
us attorney anton valukas recently said the additional fines 
apparently would involve civil issues that were not resolved by the 
settlement of criminal charges filed by the government 
sundstrand pleaded guilty earlier this year in rockford to four 
counts of defrauding the defense department by overbilling on 
aircraft parts it also pleaded guilty in seattle to mischarging on 
government contracts 
in the october plea agreement sundstrand also admitted to 
lavishing gifts and gratuities on government employees and military 
personnel involved in its contract bidding as well as billing the 
government for trips and other perks of company executives no names 
have been divulged 
the pentagon suspended the company from bidding on government 
contracts after it admitted to engaging in the largest military 
fraud in us history 
in addition the state department reportedly is delaying approval 
of export licenses required to send sundstrand products overseas

syracuse grabbed its typical big lead 
against louisiana tech but this time it nearly cost the orangemen 
their own tournament 
we went ahead 223 and thought we had them thats the worst 
thing a player can do said syracuse forward stephen thompson 
after the fourthranked orangemen held off louisiana tech in 
overtime to take a 10698 victory sunday in the 12th annual carrier 
classic 
when you let a good team like that back into the game it 
builds their confidence once they got confident they were hard to 
stop said thompson who led syracuse with 25 points 
guard matt roe agreed that syracuses 23point lead in the first 
half almost proved to be its downfall 
i think we rested on our laurels and coasted some said roe 
who also had 25 points 
but i think our defense broke down and derrick coleman 
getting into foul trouble didnt help he added 
coleman sparked syracuses triumph scoring six of his 23 points 
in the overtime period 
i wanted to play great defense and help out offensively i 
dont like losing i was determined to make sure we gutted it out 
said coleman who also had 14 rebounds 
louisiana tech senior center randy white said the key to the 
bulldogs comeback was when coleman went to the bench four minutes 
into the second half with his fourth personal foul 
we didnt do a good job early they were getting easy buckets 
and threw off our rhythym white said thats the thing about us 
we dont give up but the main key was to get coleman out of the 
ballgame 
louisiana tech forward byron newton sent the game into overtime 
with a 3point shot as time expired in regulation play newtons 
shot came after coleman missed the front end of a 1and1 with five 
seconds to play 
syracuse won the tournament for the 10th time and improved its 
record to 70 louisiana tech fell to 31 
the orangemen hit their first 11 shots racing to a 245 lead 
and appeared headed for another easy game syracuse built a 3512 
cushion midway through the half and took a 5436 lead at halftime 
but louisiana tech outscored syracuse 2311 in the opening five 
minutes of the second half to cut the deficit to 6559 with 1520 to 
play 
white then took over for the bulldogs keeping them close with 
his 20 secondhalf points white finished with 29 points before 
fouling out with five seconds to play 
coleman playing with four personals kept syracuse in the lead 
with several clutch shots but missed the free throw that could have 
clinched the game for the orangemen 
thompson and roe led syracuse with 25 points apiece roe scored 
five of his points in overtime

average gasoline prices at pumps across the 
nation decreased almost half a cent in the past two weeks dropping 
to under 1 for the first time since early july an analyst said 
sunday 
the lundberg survey a sampling of 12000 service stations 
nationwide found the average retail price of gasoline was 9961 
cents on dec 2 said analyst trilby lundberg 
there could be some further price slippage she said 
the price reflects a stable wholesale market that saw little 
fluctuation in prices despite continuing talks between members of 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
opec discussions dont in and of themselves alter supply and 
demand ms lundberg said so as a result the average wholesale 
for the nation last week showed virtually no change at all 
the average retail price which dropped 045 cents includes all 
grades of self and fullserve gasoline all taxes and all cash and 
credit sales 
on dec 2 the average price at selfserve pumps for regular 
unleaded gasoline was 8980 cents a gallon for premium unleaded 
10565 and for regular leaded 8684 cents 
the average price at fullserve pumps for regular unleaded 
gasoline was 11899 cents per gallon for premium unleaded 13008 
and regular leaded 11576 
on nov 18 the overall price was 10006 
although the opec meeting caused great movement in spot prices 
ms lundberg said supply and demand will determine the market 
mainstream wholesale and spot markets leaped at the news that 
opec had reached unity she said its a very volatile 
situation but underlying all of this excitement and volatility is a 
supply more abundant apparently than demand 
no matter what the importance of what they opec were saying 
that did not change existing supply and demand patterns she said

a us crusade to eliminate all subsidies that 
distort farm trade ran into heavy opposition sunday on the eve of 
freetrade talks among more than 100 nations 
the conflict over farm trade threatened to block progress on a 
wide range of other issues on the us agenda from trade in 
services to protection of intellectual property 
trade ministers are meeting here to give a political push to 
negotiations at the midpoint of the fouryear uruguay round of 
freetrade talks they are the biggest and most ambitious of the 
eight rounds that have been held since the formation of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade after world war ii 
the european economic community which is considered the biggest 
offender in the expensive area of farm supports repeated on sunday 
its opposition to a total elimination of tradedistorting subsidies 
canadian trade minister david crosbie characterized both the 
american and the european stands as extreme 
if americans expect progress on intellectual property and 
services without achieving an accord on farm trade theyre in for 
a shock said michael duffy minister for trade negotiations for 
australia duffy said that unless things change he expected a 
stalemate that will sour the rest of the round 
australia leads the 13nation cairns group which favors 
immediate steps to reduce farm subsidies as a way to avoid an 
impasse between the us and eec positions 
but possibly preparing for a stalemate the director general of 
gatt said the talks that formally begin monday could be regarded as 
a success even if they fail to produce agreement on certain 
contentious issues 
this weeks talks could at least stop the hideandseek game 
by nailing down areas of disagreement and setting an agenda for 
negotiations over the next two years arthur dunkel the gatt chief 
said in a news conference sunday 
the united states has encountered opposition from some developing 
countries to the two other main items on its agenda free trade in 
services such as banking insurance and legal services and better 
international protection of intellectual property such as patents 
and copyrights 
agreement is considered almost assured on other areas such as 
speeding up and strengthening gatts method of resolving disputes 
and linking gatt to other international bodies such as the world 
bank and international monetary fund 
dunkels comment seemed intended in part to prepare public 
opinion for the possibility that the montreal talks will end with 
wide gaps remaining over vital issues 
the comment also dovetailed with statements by us negotiators 
who have said they would rather leave montreal with no agreement 
than with a bad agreement on vital issues 
a sloppy compromise the americans say would only make it more 
difficult to achieve progress in the remaining two years of the 
uruguay round 
the gatt midterm review includes representatives of 105 
countries including 96 member nations of the gatt 
the united states estimates that worldwide farm subsidies cost 
200 billion a year 
the 12nation eec or common market has said it is willing to 
roll back subsidies but because of intense pressure from its 11 
million farmers the eec has been unwilling to agree to their total 
elimination 
the american option is a nonstarter frans andriessen eec 
agriculture commissioner said in a news conference sunday we 
will in this negotiation stick to our basic principle 
the current uruguay round of talks began in punta del este 
uruguay in 1986 and is scheduled to end in 1990 
the gatt is both an agreement and an organization which has a 
permanent headquarters in geneva 
the talks are taking place as usual largely behind closed 
doors they are expected to last until thursday
