president corazon aquino has failed to lift the country out of

nation address

the rebels said mrs aquino cannot cover up the basic truth 
that the filipino nation remains in deep crisis that us control 
and interference continue to fetter national development that the 
nation is being ever more polarized along class and political lines 
direct armed intervention by american troops is a distinct 
possibility meaning a much bloodier war for the filipino people 
should the us imperialists judge that the aquino regime can no 
longer stop the general advance of the peoples democratic 
revolution and protect strategic american interests 
copies of the statement were were delivered to news agencies by 
the national democratic front the front is an umbrella for 12 
rebel groups including the outlawed communist party and its 
25000member new peoples army 
the government gave no official response to the rebels

whether its michael dukakis or george bush 
the next taker of the presidential oath of office may find the 
federal government more miserly about paying part of the tab when 
he kicks up his heels at the end of the day 
the reason sen william proxmire dwis has slipped new rules 
into the conference report of the new defense authorization bill 
now awaiting president reagans signature 
they require the next presidential inaugural committee to 
reimburse the defense department for equipment and personnel it 
supplies for inaugural balls and other private inaugural events 
so proxmire says when president bush or president dukakis 
steps out on the dance floor at an invitationonly inaugural ball 
next jan 20 the american taxpayer will no longer have to foot 
part of the bill 
proxmire citing a recent general accounting office study said 
that when ronald reagan was inaugurated for the second time in 
1985 many of the events were largely planned staffed and 
executed by federal employees at a cost to the taxpayer of 155 
million 
the pentagon alone spent 10 million proxmire says 
and it used 8400 military personnel 
according to proxmire staff members and the general accounting 
office hundreds of uniformed military personnel were used at 
reagans nine inaugural balls and galas to do everything from 
checking the fur coats to playing in the bands and orchestras 
service members served as vip escorts driving visiting 
celebrities around the capital 
the cars were lent by american auto makers but the pentagon 
maintained them and filled the gas tanks 
members of the inaugural committees had military drivers for as 
long as six weeks 
army navy air force and marine corps personnel served as 
escorts at inaugural events under orders to mix and mingle and to 
see that no guests were ignored 
they also were used to set up the events themselves and to 
organize receiving lines once they were under way 
military photographers and cameramen took still and video 
pictures of the guests providing copies on request free of charge 
they took tens of thousands of pictures a proxmire staff 
member said 
under the new guidelines the bush or dukakis inaugural 
committee must reimburse the pentagon for the costs of whatever 
resources or personnel are used to supply private inaugural events 
the inaugural ceremony itself would not be included because by 
tradition and history it is a public event nor would the inaugural 
parade down pennsylvania avenue from the capitol 
but compensation would be required for pentagon services to 
private inaugural functions 
the new proxmire inaugural rules have one other twist 
in the past a proxmire staff member said members of congress 
have received complaints that service men and women were being 
required to take part in private partisan inaugural events often 
to perform duties they felt were beneath the dignity of the uniform 
under the new rules uniformed members of the armed services 
could be used at private partisan inaugural celebrations but 
only if they volunteer to take part 
and the pentagon would have to be reimbursed for the time spent 
these new provisions provide clear and strict guidelines for 
the future proxmire said 
it has taken eight years to get movement on this issue and 
while not every loophole has been closed the major abuses now are 
corrected he said

because of forest fires in wyoming while residents of 20 homes 
near spokane wash returned after the forest fire that forced 
their evacuation was controlled 
fires also burned in california colorado oregon idaho and 
utah and several large fires burned in remote areas of alaska 
yellowstone national park officials said saturday the south 
entrance to the park will be closed for several days the grant 
village hotel and a campground in yellowstone were closed earlier 
in the day and visitors and employees moved out as a precaution 
because a fire had crept to within onehalf mile of lewis lake 
we had strong and erratic winds friday a windstorm blew 
trees down on the road said park fire information officer joan 
anzelmo the same wind also kicked the fire in and had it moving 
toward grant village 
in idaho near the wyoming border 200 firefighters were strung 
out along the twomilelong northern flank of the north fork fire 
on the idahowyoming border that was burning mainly inside 
yellowstone targhee national forest spokesman bruce fox said 
officials had worried that high winds forecast for saturday 
would aggravate the 600acre blaze but cloud cover kept both the 
temperature and the wind from getting out of control and crews 
made progress on fire lines on the north flank he said 
we were anticipating it could double today if we got the wind 
but if we have another day like this we might be coming close to 
containment fox said 
other fires in yellowstone included the 14000 to 15000acre 
clover fire in a remote backcountry area 
wind created problems for the 830 firefighters trying to contain 
the mink creek fire in northwestern wyoming that charred 21300 
acres in the bridgerteton national forest and burned to within a 
mile of yellowstones boundary 
a containment line had been established around about 80 percent 
of the fires southern end said ed waldapfel fire information 
officer 
in southern idaho the poison creek fire in sawtooth national 
forest southwest of twin falls was burning out of control saturday 
more than 150 firefighters battled the blaze which had charred 
over 2000 acres of the tinderdry high desert since thursday 
residents evacuated from about 20 homes bordering the spokane 
wash indian reservation returned home saturday after 
firefighters cut a containment line around a 2420acre blaze on 
the reservation 
however officials were not yet calling the fire contained 
because 40 percent of the material inside the line was unburned 
said norm anderson a wenatchee national forest official 
about 200 firefighters including volunteers and crews from the 
us forest service and bureau of indian affairs used bulldozers 
and hand tools to cut the line around most of the fire with the 
spokane river forming the rest of the boundary anderson said 
anderson estimated the fire got within 50 yards of at least one 
home the houses were evacuated friday 
also saturday a 1500acre fire at the adjacent colville 
wash indian reservation was contained said bia fire control 
officer pat quill the blaze was blamed on farm equipment operating 
in high grasses 
about 50 people who were forced from their homes by a forest 
fire on the outskirts of kalispell mont were allowed to return 
saturday after crews managed to get a line around the 120acre 
blaze no homes were lost although several were threatened 
we only have one road closed and thats to try to find out 
where it the fire started said flathead county deputy sheriff 
phil caperton authorities believed the blaze which broke out 
friday was mancaused 
hundreds of firefighters battled about a halfdozen other fires 
in western montana two fires were being allowed to run their 
course because they are in wilderness areas including the canyon 
creek fire in the scapegoat wilderness north of ovando authorities 
closed about 75000 acres of the 250000acre wilderness on 
saturday due to the blaze 
marcia hogan a forest spokeswoman said the blaze grew 
substantially saturday but that no estimate on its size was 
available because smoke obscured much of the area earlier the 
fire was reported to have consumed 2000 acres 
a brush fire about eight miles north of canon city colo grew 
to 1700 acres saturday afternoon as about 330 firefighters and 
aircraft battled the blaze in steep terrain on cooper mountain 
bureau of land management spokesman ken smith blamed the growth 
of the fire on winds 
the wind has changed directions about three times today and 
now its fairly calm again smith said the blaze which broke 
out thursday is named the dinosaur fire because it is near a 
fossil site 
before the dinosaur fire fires had burned about 21000 acres 
across colorado since last weekend the other fires were all 
contained by thursday 
in southern california a fire sparked by fireworks was 
contained saturday after it burned about 420 acres of the san 
bernardino national forest near yucaipa said us forest service 
spokeswoman melody fountain 
and in northern california firefighters finally contained two 
fires in calaveras county after the blazes charred about 10800 
acres dick craig a spokesman for the california department of 
forestry said full control of the blazes was expected by monday 
night

property losses and fire suppression efforts said sharon torrence 
a spokeswoman for the cdf in rail road flat 150 miles east of san 
francisco and a few miles west of the fires

moslem separatists burned seven rural 
schools in the southern province of narathiwat in an apparent 
attempt to disrupt thailands general elections on sunday a 
district official said 
the official who asked not to be identified said the rebels 
torched the schools and a health clinic in isolated areas of three 
districts in the province after midnight saturday 
polling booths had been set up in some of the schools and the 
official linked the raids to efforts by moslems to disrupt the 
voting that began at 8 am 9 pm edt 
a total of 3606 candidates from 16 parties are vying for 357 
seats in the house of representatives since no party is expected 
to gain a majority several parties will probably team up to choose 
a prime minister who then forms a government 
prime minister prem tinsulanonda who does not belong to any 
party is widely predicted to return to his post heading a 
coalition of several parties he has held office since 1980 
the district official contacted by telephone said four of the 
schools burned to the ground while three others and the clinic were 
damaged but he said polling at the schools was able to proceed 
despite the nighttime raid 
moslems who form a minority in thailand are the majority in 
the province bordering malaysia the country as a whole is 
predominantly buddhist 
several hundred moslem separatists believed to be supported by 
radical groups in the middle east operate in the thaimalaysian 
border area the separatists have called for a merger with malaysia 
or various forms of autonomy 
prem called the election 24 months early after he dissolved 
parliament april 29 disbanding his factionridden coalition 
government 
the 67yearold former army commander voted in the provincial 
capital of korat northeast of bangkok but he has not said whether 
he would accept another term 
thai elections are largely centered on personalities not 
political platforms and the main contention has been whether prem 
should return or not 
although his popularity has been waning most leaders of the 
four current coalition parties back his return and he remains 
favored by three institutions which figure in the choice of a prime 
minister the military bureaucracy and constitutional monarchy 
whoever emerges as the new prime minister is almost certainly to 
keep thailand on the same general course of economically 
conservative politically prowestern policies the economy has 
boomed in the past two years 
the present coalition government comprises the democrat party of 
deputy prime minister bhichai rattakul the chart thai thai 
nation of deputy prime minister chatichai choonhavan the social 
action party of foreign minister siddhi savetsila and the 
rassadorn citizens party of deputy prime minister thienchai

ceasefire and halting all military operations however iraq has 
not only not observed a ceasefire but has been conducting new acts 
of aggression by occupying iranian territory and has blatantly 
violated this article tehran radio quoted velayatis letter as 
saying

he wore a wool scarf and gloves in summer and 
lived like a hermit communicating with the outside world mostly by 
telephone 
but when glenn gould died of a stroke nine days after his 50th 
birthday in 1982 canada lost not only a notorious eccentric but 
one of its greatest musicians 
for the first time since the pianists death an exhibition at 
the national library in ottawa provides an intimate look at goulds 
life from his checkered cloth cap to the room keys he collected at 
hotels across the continent including an entire set from new 
yorks stanhope hotel 
fortunately for posterity gould was a pack rat who set aside 
one room of his apartment on torontos west st clair avenue for 
scores scripts letters programs souvenirs and assorted junk 
he wrote everything down on pads you can almost follow him 
through each day said stephen willis head of the librarys 
music manuscript collection the exhibit runs through midseptember 
a packing list reminds gould to bring valium and librium for his 
nerves and a tv guide a 1966 commentary for the canadian 
broadcasting corp says in red ball point sometimes it seems to 
me that mozart has had a rather better press than he deserves 
a letter from his grandmother recommends a mustard pack for his 
sore back and gould commiserates with an ailing leonard bernstein 
dear leonardo by offering some tips on hypochondria i have 
several titles for diseases which i am expecting to have in later 
life but have not yet had occasion to make use of 
after a piano technician dislocated goulds shoulder with a 
backslap the pianist distributed a notice requesting that no one 
offer to shake his hand this will eliminate embarrassment all 
around it said 
a canadian celebrity at 15 goulds international career had a 
sensational start he landed a lucrative columbia records contract 
the day after his new york debut in 1955 and the first of more 
than 100 discs bachs goldberg variations is still rated a 
classic 
he suddenly abandoned the concert platform in 1964 in pursuit of 
what he saw as a purer musical experience in the recording studio 
he eventually became his own producer controlling a mixing board 
the way a conductor directs an orchestra 
he loved the microphone and dedicated much of his time to radio 
and tv documentaries 
a night owl gould rented a studio at torontos inn on the park 
because it was the only place in town he could get something to eat 
in the early hours willis said 
the exhibit features goulds favorite steinway his cluttered 
pigeonhole desk and the rickety cardtable chair his father 
modified as a piano stool gould preferred a lowslung chair so 
that his fingers lay flat along the keyboard the antithesis of the 
pounding romantic style he abhorred 
an animal lover gould left his worldly goods to the toronto 
humane society and the salvation army the library was allowed to 
purchase the collection of 20000 items packed in 226 boxes on 
condition it organize an exhibit the display tours the rest of 
canada later this year and negotiations are under way with us 
and european museums 
the most personal documents were withheld but willis said there 
was evidence of two or three relationships with women that did 
not last long 
in retrospect goulds career is filled with irony he searched 
for musical clarity and control in what he termed the backbone 
of a score and dismissed virtuoso playing and tonal beauty for its 
own sake 
however he marred some recordings by humming along with the 
music a habit critics considered an affectation readers will 
find the groans and croons intolerable the penguin guide says of 
one bach recording 
gould preferred the piano to the harpsichord and played no part 
in the rediscovery of original instruments and pitch that has 
revolutionized baroque listening in the 1980s 
he saw nothing wrong with splicing dozens of takes for one 
definitive performance and envisioned an era when recordings 
adjusted electronically by home listeners would entirely replace 
public concerts 
gould holds an olympian place in canadian music 
as a cultural symbol he grows in stature every year both as 
a true canadian original and as a certified hero of modernist 
performers said robert everettgreen music critic for the globe

vigilance is needed if the beauty of 
olympic national park is to be preserved the director of the 
national park service said at the parks 50th birthday party 
there are those who suggest that having already established 
the park lands their preservation is assured and there is little 
more to be done with them for them to provide for this adequate 
protection and maintenance william penn mott said saturday 
but theres much to be done if these places are to fulfill 
their heritage he warned the more than 500 people at saturdays 
ceremonies 
mott noted that more than 300 million people annually visit the 
nations parks compared with 16 million visitors in 1938 
our park system continues to grow and we need to continue to 
grow to preserve such outdoor areas for future generations he 
said 
president franklin delano roosevelt voiced those same sentiments 
before signing the legislation sponsored by local congressman mon 
wallgren that created the park five decades ago 
i think you can count on my help in getting that national 
park not only because we need it for us old people and you young 
people but for a whole lot of young people who are going to come 
along in the next hundred years of america roosevelt told port 
angeles residents in 1937 
on june 29 1938 roosevelt signed a bill setting aside 634000 
acres to be preserved as olympic national park 
today the park is 922000 acres of glaciercapped mountains 
alpine meadows temperate rain forest and ocean coastline the 
nations thirdmostvisited national park with more than 3 million 
a year olympic remains one of the wildest 
the nonprofit national parks and conservation association as 
part of a nationwide assessment of landacquisition needs has 
proposed about 180000 acres be added to further protect important 
watersheds and habitat 
a study of ways to maintain national parks integrity into the 
21st century is under way by a task force of park service managers 
mott said entrance fees such as those which were imposed last 
year at olympic national park help provide such research funds 
along with local resource management he added 
along with preserving the parks officials also need to 
continue to explore the cultural and recreational interests of 
special populations minorities and international visitors to 
ensure that the parks are truly available for the benefit and 
enjoyment of all mott said 
other issues to be addressed include protection of endangered 
species air and water pollution and encroaching development 
outside the parks mott said 
he also called for improved cooperation among adjacent land 
owners and land management agencies outside the park as well as 
the academic and scientific communities expanded involvement with 
park affairs

hosting the republican national convention 
will cost the city of new orleans roughly 55 million in cash and 
the effort to raise that money through donations apparently will go 
right down to the wire 
weve raised 42 million as of last tuesday said ron 
jones president of the louisiana cocacola bottling co and head 
of the fund drive 
that puts us pretty much on target maybe a little behind 
he added we wanted to finish up aug 1 i think were more 
likely to finish up that first or second week of august 
the convention begins the third week of august running aug 
1518 in the louisiana superdome 
raising money in a city still beset by hard economic times 
hasnt been easy jones concedes but he insists the money is being 
scraped together with a minimum of armtwisting 
in a community like new orleans said jones the private 
sector and individuals in the community are prepared to come to the 
table to help out the city 
without question the city needed help reeling from 10 percent 
unemployment and declining tax revenue mayor sidney barthelemy and 
the city council tirelessly pursued the gop in 1986 luring the 
party to the louisiana superdome with the promise of 8 million in 
financial support for the convention 
barthelemy and company are banking on the convention being a 
huge economic boon to the community not only because of it will 
spur a projected 137 million in spending but also because all the 
publicity could attract new business 
the 8 million was both in cash and in kind said kurt 
steiner barthelemys chief administrative officer 
in kind contributions with an estimated value of 25 
million to 3 million included use of the citys parks a 
performing arts theatre the municipal auditorium and other places 
for meetings office space and entertainment 
cash contributions steiner said include money for a new 
milliondollar light system and a halfmilliondollar sound system 
to be used by the republicans in the superdome 
security including overtime for police will eat up a lot of 
the money steiner said along witth the cost of building stages 
media platforms seats and a raised false floor to hide cables 
theres also a computer system for the convention staff and 
insurance 
the citys prospects for coming up with the money looked dim for 
a time earlier this year the greater new orleans convention fund 
headed by oil millionaire pat taylor was struggling after raising 
about 2 million in contributions taylor publicly complained in 
may that donations were lagging 
that prompted the barthelemy administration to appoint a new 
committee the new orleans special events fund headed by jones 
mervin trail president of the greater new orleans tourist and 
convention commission and by jim bob moffett president of 
freeportmcmoran corporation and chairman of the local chamber of 
comerce 
still assisted by taylors group the special events fund took 
an aggressive more focused approach zeroing in on individual 
chamber members the tourist and hotel industry and major 
corporations 
so far jones said the tactic has worked netting contributions 
ranging from 150 from small businesses to more than 200000 from 
major corporations the city has so far been able to meet 
contractural obligations arising from construction in the dome and 
republican convention officials said last week preparations for the 
convention were progressing on schedule

a grisly cycle of murders and 
reprisal killings by leftists and rightists is raising fears of a 
breakdown in law and order and threatening efforts to promote 
democracy and protect human rights 
hardly a day passes without a murder or more being headlined 
in our newspapers the catholic bishops conference of the 
philippines said in a recent statement 
our sensibilities are being battered day in and day out with 
reportage of killings and ambuscades of slaughter and violence 
acts of terrorism all the bishops said 
according to the militarys capital regional command at least 
65 people most of them police soldiers and anticommunist 
civilians were slain in the manila area by the rebel new peoples 
army in the first six months of the year 
those attacks have led to formation of rightwing death 
squads which methodically target trade unionists leftists and 
social activists in an apparent bid to undercut their influence in 
politics 
victims of the rightists include at least five filipino human 
rights lawyers a prominent leftist university president nemesio 
prudente has been wounded twice in two assassination attempts in 
the past seven months 
the violence is not limited to manila nearly 40 people have 
been slain this year in politically motivated violence in angeles 
home of the usrun clark air base 50 miles north of manila 
similar killings have been reported in cebu bacolod and other 
major cities 
several regional officials of the progovernment new patriotic 
alliance have dropped out of the organization in fear since the 
groups national chairman lean alejandro was slain last 
september the murder was not solved 
alejandros group was among the social activist organizations 
that rallied behind corazon aquino in the february 1986 revolt that 
toppled president ferdinand marcos 
mrs aquino who became president on the promise of restoring 
democracy and human rights has called for an end to the violence 
she warns that the unbridled killings will erode public confidence 
in her government 
but mrs aquinos pledge to restore democracy has not been 
enough to quell the 19year communist insurgency which expanded 
during the 20year rule of her ousted predecessor 
the killings underscore mrs aquinos fragile control of the 
police and armed forces military dissidents were responsible for a 
series of coup attempts that rocked the aquino government and 
leftists claim police and soldiers have been behind many of the 
rightwing killings 
those arrested in a june 30 attack on prudente include five 
manila policemen and a member of a governmentbacked anticommunist 
vigilante group organized by police 
prudente who was jailed under marcos for alleged ties to a 
leftist assassination team had been accused by police of harboring 
communists at his polytechnic university of the philippines 
their interpretation of democracy is some kind of police 
state prudente said of his attackers its no different from 
the communist society that they have been castigating 
we are one of those victims caught in the cross fire between 
the extreme left and the extreme right he was quoted as saying 
by the sunday inquirer magazine 
inability to curb the violence also threatens to undermine 
public support for the policy of allout war against the 
communists which mrs aquino unveiled after peace talks with the 
rebels collapsed in january 1987 
liberal filipinos have begun to complain that the total war 
campaign is polarizing society and encouraging violence not only 
against doctrinaire marxists but also against those campaigning 
legally for social and economic reform 
the human rights issue calls for an urgent reassessment of the 
counterinsurgency policy that has forced the government to trade 
its humanist soul in exchange for shortterm political stability 
provided by support of the armed forces wrote prominent 
columnist amando doronila in the manila chronicle 
earlier this year the rebels claimed they would scale down 
assassinations because of the alarm the killings generated among 
the urban middle class which the communists hope to recruit to 
their cause 
but last week arnel sandoval spokesman of the rebel alex 
boncayao brigade said killings would continue as long as the 
aquino government fails to curb the rightists 
as the aquino government continues to protect and refuse to 
punish criminals in uniform so shall the abb resolve the bring 
these people the revolutionary justice they deserve he said

hospitals grappling with mounting infectious 
waste may soon get help from an unlikely source the department of 
energys coal research program 
a specialized boiler could solve problems associated with 
disposing of surgical gloves gowns syringes and needles and at 
the same time boost coal production by as much as 5 million tons 
per year doe said 
department officials said in interviews last week that doe has 
entered a costsharing agreement with good samaritan hospital of 
lebanon pa for a demonstration project involving the boiler 
an early stumbling block could be cost a boiler of the size 
needed for a large hospital may not yet be economical although the 
government believes research will ultimately lower the cost said 
doe spokesman robert c porter 
the problem of medical waste disposal has been graphically 
demonstrated this summer by the needles syringes and other debris 
washing up on beaches in new york new jersey and other states 
some beaches have been closed and the source of the pollution has 
not yet been found 
applying cleanburning coal technology to hospital waste 
disposal is a possible spinoff of our program that could not 
have come at a better time said j allen wampler assistant 
energy secretary for fossil energy 
hospitals are struggling with the problem of growing amounts 
of infectious waste and it translates directly into a dollars and 
cents issue the expense of discarding this material is increasing 
the costs of medical care 
the experimental coalburning device is called a fluidized bed 
boiler as envisioned by doe it would enable hospitals to burn 
waste while producing energy for heat or steam at the hospital 
widespead use of the boiler could create a market for as much as 3 
million to 5 million tons of additional coal production a year the 
department said 
but the main objective of the experiment is for hospitals to 
efficiently dispose of infectious materials and avoid burdensome 
hauling costs large hospitals particularly those treating aids 
patients can pay up to 300000 per year to transport waste to 
incinerators or other disposal facilities 
the boiler is part of an effort by the federal government and 
private industry in the last 10 years to develop new ways of 
burning coal without harming the environment 
most conventional boilers burn coal rapidly at a temperature of 
up to 3000 degrees in a fluidized bed boiler the coal burns more 
slowly at a lower temperature giving it time to interact with 
limestone which acts as a sponge to absorb pollutants 
its at about 1600 degrees which is almost ideal for 
disposing of the waste material in hospitals porter said 
thats the temperature at which the toxins break down or are 
destroyed 
the boiler has been used commercially to produce energy but has 
not been tried as an incinerator for medical wastes according to 
kenneth markel jr of does energy technology center in morgantown 
wva 
while coal is among the least expensive of fuels the boiler can 
also run on other materials such as wood chips or rubber tires 
doe said it has already paid 93000 to help design the oneyear 
project whose total cost of 961800 is to be shared by the 
department the commonwealth of pennsylvania and yorkshipley of 
york pa which is one of the contractors

the army corps of engineers efforts to 
tame the mississippi are enabling barge traffic to scrape along in 
spite of this summers record low water and the rivers natural 
tendencies corps officials say 
what the river wants to do is wiggle back and forth what 
were trying to do is stabilize the channel said mike robinson 
a historian with the corps in vicksburg miss 
strangled by a lack of rain the mississippi has dropped to more 
than 20 feet below normal at memphis and sand buildups have caused 
traffic jams involving hundreds of barges 
the mississippis flow is expected to fall to 20 percent of 
normal at memphis before the drought is over and towboat operators 
say theyll lose more than 60 million this summer because of 
reduced traffic 
on july 10 the mississippi registered a record low of 107 feet 
below zero on the river gauge at memphis and the flow of water 
rushing past the city was 115000 cubic feet per second zero is an 
arbitrary mark set at 18391 feet above sea level 
at what the corps calls full bank the flow at memphis is 
13 million cfs and the river measures 34 feet above zero the 
normal flow for july is 411000 cfs 
the record low flow of 78000 cfs was set in 1936 when the river 
measured zero on the memphis gauge since then the main channel 
has been made narrower and deeper 
in the old days when the river was left to wander the 
mississippi often split into two or more channels and formed big 
winding loops 
in the 1930s and 40s the corps of engineers cut off 16 of 
those loops to straighten the channel and shortened the lower 
mississippi by 150 miles 
this years low water has revealed stone dikes and huge concrete 
slabs that corps officials say are more critical than ever to 
keeping the river open to barges 
the dikes sticking out into the water like long skinny 
fingers force the mississippis main channel toward the middle of 
the riverbed while mile upon mile of concrete revetment a 
blanket of concrete slabs keeps the river from forming loops by 
eroding into the bank 
the river can be more than a mile across from bank to bank but 
its main channel is often only 500 to 600 feet wide the drought 
has cut that to less than 200 feet in some areas 
narrowing the river and preventing it from flowing slowly around 
a series of bends causes the main channel to dig itself deeper in 
spite of record lows the lower mississippi remains 25 to 40 feet 
deep in some places 
but towboats are running into trouble at the socalled 
crossings where the river channel winds back and forth across 
the riverbed the current slackens and sand and sediment settle 
out sometimes putting the river at less than nine feet deep the 
minimum generally needed for barges and towboats 
the corps has identified more than 30 troublesome crossings 
where dredging will likely be needed this summer between 
caruthersville mo and greenville miss

mikhail s gorbachev moved away from quiet 
diplomacy and got tough last week as he sought to resolve a dispute 
over an obscure mountain region whose importance has grown far 
beyond its contested borders 
the soviet leaders handling of the problem offers some insight 
into how far he is prepared to go in allowing more openness and 
giving people a greater say in how they are governed 
gorbachev said the struggle over nagornokarabakh a mostly 
armenian enclave in the republic of azerbaijan has inflicted 
immense damage on perestroika his reform program he warned it 
could doom his plans to modernize soviet society 
addressing the soviet leadership monday at a special session of 
the supreme soviets presidium gorbachev said if we fail to 
find the solution to this question today and we must find it 
this would have farreaching consequences and would affect all 
perestroika 
the immediate issue is the future of the sparsely populated 
largely undeveloped region in the caucasus mountains the ethnic 
armenian majority set out in february to secede from largely moslem 
azerbaijan and join predominantly christian armenia 
but in the soviet union a patchwork quilt of 15 republics 
shared by more than 100 distinct ethnic and national groups 
redrawing maps is a dangerous business 
gorbachev and the presidium the top executive body of 
government served notice they were not about to open that 
pandoras box 
clearly gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness is not a 
guarantee of free speech as practiced in western democracies and 
democratization does not sanction a challenge to oneparty rule 
the government has tolerated massive demonstrations including 
some in the armenian capital of yerevan that have drawn hundreds of 
thousands perhaps even a million people according to witness 
accounts but gorbachev said redrawing the borders would constitute 
an abuse of democratization fundamentally at variance with the 
aims of perestroika 
giving in to nationalist demands he told the presidium would 
poison public mentality with nationalist venom and thereby spoil 
relations between the peoples for many many years to come 
in unanimously rejecting nagornokarabakhs attempt to secede 
against azerbaijan the presidium warned that a series of strikes 
that began in nagornokarabakh and spread to armenia crippling the 
local economy had exhausted the presidiums patience 
the kremlin authorized police to take essential measures to 
end the strikes and activities directed at kindling national 
strife and attempts to misuse democratic rights for antidemocratic 
purposes 
troops stationed in the strifetorn areas were reinforced 
paruyr ayrikyan a leader of the annexation drive who was 
arrested in march on a charge of defaming the state was stripped 
of his soviet citizenship and ordered expelled from the country 
the staterun national press attacked strike leaders by name 
first indications showed the new tough tactics were having an 
impact most workers in armenia returned to their jobs although 
the general strike continued in nagornokarabakh 
the central leadership clearly has acted with more restraint and 
tolerance than would have been expected in previous soviet regimes 
not long ago the kremlin would have quickly turned to force to put 
down the turmoil 
this time the kremlin first tried the power of persuasion 
gorbachev made a personal appeal feb 26 for civic maturity and 
restraint and the mass demonstrations in yerevan subsided but 
two days later a riot broke out in the azerbaijani city of 
sumgait and at least 32 people were killed 26 of them armenians 
the kremlin also tried changing the local leadership installing 
new party chiefs in armenia and azerbaijan the new officials 
quickly acknowledged that armenians in nagornokarabakh had been 
deprived culturally and socially under previous regimes 
in march the central government announced a major remedial 
program to improve cultural and social conditions in 
nagornokarabakh with much of the aid going to the armenian 
majority 
but armenians outside the region perhaps encouraged by the new 
latitude given them by glasnost made annexation of 
nagornokarabakh a crusade those who died in sumgait were its 
martyrs 
the legislatures of both nagornokarabakh and the armenian 
republic sought the annexation claiming the right of 
selfdetermination guaranteed by the soviet constitution but 
azerbaijan citing another constitutional provision requiring 
consent of affected republics before redrawing boundaries rejected 
the appeals 
that set the stage for intervention by the central government 
democratic rights and the new conditions opened up and created 
by perestroika are being clearly misused for antidemocratic 
purposes gorbachev told the presidium both sides he said were 
using territorial claims to stir up national sentiments and 
conceal the really difficult crying problems that had 
accumulated 
victory can only come by finding a common course gorbachev 
said adding that the search for that course must continue

a new plant that could turn corn into a health 
food and help nourish proteinstarved children in the third world 
is being promoted by the us governments national research 
council 
its called qpm for qualityprotein maize because it contains 
about twice the usable protein of ordinary varieties maize is the 
international word for corn 
a small research team working for 10 years developed qpm at 
the same laboratories where nobel peace prize winner norman e 
borlaug produced the new wheat varieties that brought the green 
revolution in the 1950s 
noel vietmeyer an expert on useful but neglected plants for the 
research council calls borlaug 74 the spiritual godfather of 
qpm although he was not directly involved in the project at the 
international center for the improvement of maize and wheat near 
mexico city borlaug still works at the center 
maize is often the crop of the poor and in the maizegrowing 
areas of the world millions of children living in poverty are not 
thriving says the newly published report of a panel appointed by 
the council 
here is an opportunity to explore this new approach to 
relieving an intolerable situation it says 
the world produces enough corn to provide each inhabitant with 
about 200 pounds a year it is a staple food for nearly half the 
worlds chronically undernourished people 
a typical diet might consist of 20 or more tortillas a day 
supplemented with hot peppers some native greens and little or 
nothing else says the councils monthly news report for july 
tortillas are generally made in latin america with corn meal 
people in wealthier countries get their protein from meat fish 
cheese and a variety of other foods small children get it from 
milk tens of millions of poor people in the third world survive on 
corn cassava yams plantain and other foods low in protein 
when small children are weaned in those countries they cannot 
eat enough of the beans or rice to provide the protein milk has 
given them and millions suffer from kwashiorkor a 
proteindeficiency disease that stunts growth 
the report suggests distributing qpm in areas that already 
depend heavily on corn to feed small children the highlands of the 
andes mountains in south america central america most of africa 
bangladesh indonesia and the philippines 
it sees qpm as also having important advantages for industrial 
countries 
there is for instance distinct promise for breakfast cereals 
and snack foods both of which are constantly criticized for their 
low nutritional value it says 
the new maize variety is not yet ready for use in the united 
states it was created with the third world in mind and its pollen 
is spread naturally by the wind in the united states farmers use 
hybrid seeds produced in greenhouses or on special plots of land 
so that the seeds always breed true 
one of the problems with qpm is that it looks and tastes like 
ordinary corn and so do the gruels cakes and tortillas made from 
it this makes it more palatable than some earlier varieties but 
there is a danger that a field of qpm might interbreed with a field 
of ordinary maize and the qpm would soon lose its special quality 
the report says that for this reason it will be especially 
important to introduce qpm in an organized way

vivian filemyrs health is frail and money is 
tight so when the government suddenly slashed her share of her 
exhusbands military pension she had to plead with doctors and 
creditors to accept less than usual when bills came due 
the 66yearold austin woman says her main source of income was 
cut without warning in may from about 1100 a month to 900 and 
shes spent the last two months trying to find out why 
she thinks the cut came because her eshusband a retired 
colonel may have incurred a debt to the government many years 
after their 1972 divorce 
the military wont say more she said because it would be an 
invasion of his privacy 
my credit rating is being hurt i have to call my creditors 
and say my check is reduced and i dont know why and i cant pay 
you ms filemyr said 
congressional officials and members of an exwives support group 
in alexandria va say ms filemyrs case is not unique and may 
illustrate a growing trend as the government cracks down on its bad 
debts 
the government theyll get their money any way they can 
said shirley taft former president of expose or expartners of 
servicemenwomen for equality 
weve heard from quite a few women and its quite 
devastating they dont even know why its being reduced and the 
finance centers wont tell them they only know the mans gone into 
debt for something ms taft said 
she said representatives of the group met with pentagon 
officials earlier this month to argue that the exwives should not 
be held liable for debts incurred by their former spouses after the 
divorce is final 
but the pentagon told the group chances of an administrative 
change are very slim she said 
congressional hearings on the matter and other related issues 
are planned in september before a subcommittee of the house armed 
services committee says a spokeswoman for rep pat schroeder 
dcolo who sponsored the 1982 former spouse protection act 
under the bill courts can award a portion of a servicemans 
retirement check to the former spouse if the couple were married 
at least 10 years the exwife can receive the money directly 
through the militarys finance centers ms taft said 
maj david super pentagon spokesman said the military is 
looking into the situation but continues to operate with existing 
administrative rules and laws 
ms taft said her organization plans to poll its 3500 members 
about the problem this month 
this is not an isolated case ms filemyr wrote in a letter 
to rep jake pickle dtexas i have spoken with various women 
across the country who have related to me that they are in the same 
situation 
mrs filemyr said she was divorced after 25 years of marriage 
and was on welfare for years as she fought for the 1982 law 
i only had a little job here a little job there and i kept 
getting sicker she said ive had it rough yes ive had it 
rough her only other source of income is a monthly social security 
check of about 160 she said 
rep schroeders spokeswoman said the congresswoman plans to 
introduce legislation that would divide retirement pay according to 
a formula based on the number of years of service and the length of 
the marriage rather than leaving the decision to individual courts 
or states

bolstered by their highest delegate strength ever 
at a democratic convention union leaders believe they can deliver 
25 million votes for michael dukakis in november 
although the aflcio will not officially endorse dukakis until 
aug 24 after the republican convention its political operatives 
left here with no intention of waiting for what one called the 
pro forma announcement to begin working on dukakis behalf 
an 8 million voter registration campaign put on a back burner 
while unions concentrated on collecting convention delegates in the 
primaries and caucuses is being reignited this week 
after breakfasting with dukakis last week aflcio president 
lane kirkland said in an interview that unions will have less 
difficulty than they did four years ago in getting their members to 
vote a democratic ticket 
in 1984 there was a swell of support in favor of reagan he 
said we stemmed that tide better than the others this year 
there is an entirely different set of circumstances theres no 
incumbency and people want a change 
despite the union label on 1054 or more than onefourth of the 
democratic convention delegates labor still is maintaining a lower 
profile in comparison with its allout boosterism of walter mondale 
four years ago 
we worked harder in 1984 and all we got for it was fewer 
delegates and more abuse said james booe secretarytreasurer of 
the communications workers of america 
it was two of labors more consistent supporters in the senate 
john glenn of ohio and gary hart of colorado who cried special 
interest after the aflcio endorsed mondale in october 1983 that 
was four months before the first iowa caucuses and new hampshire 
primary 
kirkland takes satisfaction that both hart and glenn went down 
the chute afterwards and that no candidate for national office 
has repeated what he views as a slur since but the scar is still 
there 
to provide dukakis with a winning margin labor leaders believe 
they will have to get at least a 65 percent vote for him from a 
rankandfile membership that cast 39 percent of its votes four 
years ago for ronald reagan 
there is a mythology that it was the bluecollar workers that 
brought reagan in said kirkland sixty percent of our people 
voted for walter mondale but if we have to get twothirds of our 
membership which encompasses a wide crosssection of the country 
to elect a decent candidate it tells me there is a strong 
conservative bias in the rest of the population 
the aflcio plans to have at least 300000 volunteers working 
the polls on election day said john perkins director of the 
federations committee on political education but first it has to 
ensure that its members are registered 
labor political activists are working on a threepart formula 
that could allow unions to provide enough votes to counter the 
acknowledged more conservative views of the rest of the electorate 
it calls for 
voter registration that is 15 percentage points above the 
national average of 72 percent aflcio officials estimate that 
about 80 percent of the federations 141 million members are now 
registered 
turnout on election day that is 15 percentage points higher 
than the 53 percent of the voting age population that went to the 
polls in 1984 
and a vote among union members for the laborendorsed 
candidate that is at least 15 percentage points higher than the 
electorate at large gives him the aflcio achieved that in 1984 
with the 61 percent of its membership voting for mondale compared 
with 41 percent of the total electorate 
with all three kirkland estimates trade union support of a 
candidate is worth a net 25 million votes nationwide thats not 
something to be sneezed at he says with pride 
according to political directors for individual unions the 
effort faltered last time on making sure members were registered 
and getting them to the polls on election day 
even though mondale had an early lock on the labor endorsement 
many believed he could not win and support waned according to one 
labor activist 
whats different this year is a belief among labor activists 
that bush has so many negatives that a strong union turnout could 
provide dukakis with the edge to beat him 
our rank and file by a slim margin voted for reagan said 
loretta bowen the communication workers political director but 
theyve indicated overwhelmingly they will come back to the 
democratic side if george bush were a warm individual the fact he 
has been a supporter of reagan would help him but our members 
think hes arrogant and a snob

vietnam once the bitterest of us rivals is 
showing an increasingly benign attitude toward the united states 
raising the possibility of an eventual accommodation 
for the short term however the united states is refusing even 
to discuss the differences between the two countries preferring to 
await a total withdrawal of vietnamese troops from cambodia before 
making overtures of its own 
the administration also wants a full accounting from vietnam of 
american servicemen still listed as missing 15 years after the us 
pullout from that country for some time the usvietnamese 
dialogue has been limited exclusively to humanitarian issues 
meanwhile vietnam is showing a new face to united states in 
large and small ways 
this past week three us navy fliers picked up by a vietnamese 
ship in the south china sea after ditching their plane had nothing 
but praise for their rescuers they were well treated and were 
returned quickly to us custody 
on similar occasions in the past rescued american servicemen 
were confined for months in difficult conditions by vietnamese 
authorities who sometimes demanded up to 20000 for their release 
there are other examples of hanois more forthcoming attitude 
a week ago vietnam announced that it will allow more than 
50000 persons many identified with the usbacked saigon 
government that was toppled by hanois forces in 1975 to emigrate 
to the united states most served time in reeducation camps known 
for their unhospitable environment 
on monday us and vietnamese technical experts will meet in 
hanoi to discuss joint onsite investigations to help resolve the 
fate of the nearly 2400 american servicemen still unaccounted for 
from the vietnam war the state department said it was pleased with 
vietnams promise of a concerted effort to resolve this issue 
vietnam also has been allowing vietnamese children fathered by 
american servicemen to emigrate with their families to the united 
states a group of 78 left earlier this month bringing the total 
to more than 11000 
still the reagan administration has shown no interest in 
opening talks on normalizing relations preferring to keep economic 
and diplomatic pressure on hanoi 
when you have a strategy thats working you dont abandon it 
just when its beginning to succeed a state department official 
said 
this official and others insisting on anonymity said they 
believe that vietnam is feeling the pressure of a declining economy 
and the international isolation it has suffered as a result of its 
continued military presence in cambodia 
while many other asian nations are enjoying an economic boom 
partially the result of largescale exports to the united states 
vietnam ranks among the worlds poorest nations with no access to 
us markets because of a trade embargo 
at the united nations resolutions condemning the vietnamese 
role in cambodia consistently have been approved by overwhelming 
margins among major countries only india has recognized the 
prohanoi government which has been in power in cambodia since 1979 
some in congress including conservatives believe the time has 
come for the united states to reciprocate the vietnamese gestures 
on thursday sen frank murkowski ralaska urged the 
administration to think seriously about its policy in vietnam 
a sentiment shared by sen larry pressler rsd 
sen john mccain rariz and rep thomas ridge rpa have 
called on the administration to exchange small diplomatic missions 
with vietnam in hanoi and washington both are former prisoners of 
war in vietnam 
all this has fallen on deaf ears in the administration 
secretary of state george shultz said last week the united 
states will unequivocally welcome normal relations with vietnam 
only when there is an acceptable cambodia settlement and a 
satisfactory accounting of the missing american servicmen he said 
the us commitment to these two goals is unshakeable 
vietnam seems eager for a pullout from cambodia recently 
announcing plans to withdraw 50000 troops this year and agreeing 
to take part in preliminary peace talks involving rival cambodian 
factions and other asian nations those talks will start monday in 
indonesia 
cambodias president heng samrin said in an interview 
published last week that a vietnamese withdrawal from cambodia will 
be completed in 1990 even if there is no political solution reached 
between the cambodian government and three rebel groups

exrepublican presidential candidate pat 
robertson says democrats will be disappointed if they are hoping 
for friction at the republican national convention between his 
supporters and backers of vice president george bush 
we got what we wanted roberson said i like the 1984 
platform and were in agreement to stick with it 
robertson who pledged to campaign on bushs behalf attended a 
unity 88 republican rally saturday in charleston along with gov 
carroll a campbell jr and secretary of the interior donald hodel 
the television evangelist said democrat michael dukakis was the 
most liberal candidate any party has nominated for the 
presidency and called the democratic convention a carefully 
crafted charade to make liberal democrats look like moderate 
republicans 
roberston also said there would be no floor fights on platform 
issues at the gop convention next month in new orleans however he 
did say he would like a plank calling for the nomination of 
conservative candidates at all levels of the federal judiciary 
we want judges who will interpret the constitution as the law 
of the land robertson said not rewrite the constitution as 
the law of the land 
robertson urged his followers to get behind bush predicting 
they could provide the margin of victory in as many as 20 closely 
contested states

bloodshot eyes a hoarse voice and a weary 
demeanor are hallmarks of rod colemans profession a result of 
working 15 hours or more at a time in the acrid smoke and intense 
heat of forest fires 
injury or death are possible the pay is marginal an average of 
about 8 an hour except for an occasional good meal the only 
benefit may be a shower after a shift 
for more than a week now coleman has led crews battling the 
mink creek fire which by sunday had blackened 22650 acres in the 
teton wilderness of the bridgerteton national forest 40 miles 
northeast of jackson 
its just so dry incident commander dale jarrell said 
friday we just have to have some rain but our weather people 
say theres nothing in the forecast for at least 10 days and were 
also facing the prospect of some dry lightning strikes in the next 
few days 
wind gusting to 35 mph and humidity as low as 11 percent have 
exacerbated the dry conditions 
the main thrust of efforts by firefighters as many as 830 but 
down to 737 sunday has been to prevent the fire from spreading 
south where it could threaten homes and dude ranches in buffalo 
valley 
the firefighters line across the southern end was holding 
sunday but the north end had burned about a quarter of a mile into 
yellowstone national park officials said it was in a remote area 
more than 30 miles from any major park attractions but other fires 
burned inside the park 
the southern edge of the huge blaze was about five miles from 
buffalo valley but in between is an area of blowdown trees 
piles of tinderdry wood left by a tornado last year 
were holding on at the south end and every day we do that is 
a real positive said jarrell 
the lightningcaused blaze broke out july 11 and because it is 
in a wilderness area officials are required by law to allow it to 
burn its natural course as much as possible such blazes are 
usually allowed to burn until they threaten human life or private 
property in the long run officials say wildlife benefits 
with the threat to residents south of the fire crews have taken 
a more active role however they are restricted in their digging 
and cutting and the use of bulldozers and mechanical tools such as 
chain saws is discouraged all work must be done by air or on foot 
there is no vehicle access 
the cost of fighting the blaze was just over 2 million sunday 
forestry officials said 
any wilderness fire is more difficult to fight because of its 
remoteness said coleman who has been fighting fires since 1968 
the constraints make it even harder 
in addition to digging fire lines crews deployed 20 miles of 
hose to draw water from lakes and ponds they also burned 2000 
acres to create a fire break on the southern edge 
coleman 39 a us bureau of land management range 
conservationist from vale ore said some firefighters have 
experienced knee and leg problems because of the steep terrain but 
morale he said has been fantastic these teams have a lot of 
pride 
for the past few days coleman has been leader of a group of 
chippewa indian firefighters from montana that crew just arrived 
from battling another blaze in lame deer mont 
the base camp has facilities for eating sleeping caring for 
the injured and organizing the firefighting officials pore over 
maps and infrared photographs of the fire area 
health and safety officials monitor fatigue among crews 
shipping some out for a rest and demobilizing others entirely 
bringing in fresh crews to replace them a fresh crew could expect 
to stay on the scene as long as 21 days 
ill be here that long if my legs hold out coleman said

the school system branded the worst in the nation 
could become a trailblazer under a reform package that calls for a 
slimmeddown bureaucracy and more neighborhood clout 
the proposal calls for a council at each of the citys 594 
schools to create a threeyear improvement plan if the calledfor 
changes arent made the council may fire the principal the 
councils will consist of 11 members parents teachers community 
residents and the principal 
decentralization of power in public schools is a national trend 
but no district has given schools the kind of autonomy outlined in 
this package authorities say 
even though its been talked about a few times in the country 
i think if chicago goes ahead it will be a unique step said 
spokesman chris pipho of the education commission of the states a 
denverbased nonprofit group that monitors school legislation 
the reform bill for chicagos beleaguered schools was approved 
by the legislature this spring and awaits gov james r thompsons 
signature thompson must decide by september but has not indicated 
which way hes leaning if he signs it will take effect next july 
critics say the measure focuses too much on administrative 
reorganization and too little on programs to help boost performance 
of the 430000 students in the nations thirdlargest school 
district 
even supporters say that if the measure accomplishes all thats 
intended it wont cure deepseated ills like the growing numbers 
of lowincome students a doubledigit dropout rate and teenage 
pregnancy 
wed be kidding ourselves to think that simply doing this is 
going to do all those other things that affect learning said 
michael bakalis dean of the education school at loyola university 
and the states former education superintendent 
but bakalis who cochaired a coalition of community groups that 
fought to reform chicago schools called the package a first 
step toward eliminating problems that have given the system a 
national reputation for mediocrity 
us education secretary william bennett who last year labeled 
chicago schools the nations worst has not yet studied the package 
and is inclined not to comment until enough time has passed to 
assess the results said a spokesman loye miller 
the schools problems stem largely from poorly trained teachers 
and administrators illequipped to handle the 70 percent of the 
student population from poor homes said ted oppenhiemer executive 
director of the proreform group citizens schools committee 
the fact is that children bring many more problems to school 
than they used to health problems language deficiencies just 
coming to school without the same kind of nurturing at home that 
they had when it was a typical twoparent family situation 
where children were talked to where parents were very much 
involved he said friday 
he said the reform measure will help by permitting speedier 
removal of unsatisfactory personnel 
also under the bill a teacher could be dismissed after 45 days 
for unsatisfactory performance berman said teachers now found to 
be doing a poor job by the principal and a consulting teacher are 
given a year to improve 
however the measure does not provide additional money for 
retraining teachers or administrators oppenheimer noted its 
fine to get rid of lousy teachers but its better to retrain 
and teacher retraining takes money he said 
the package also would allow principals to hire teachers on 
merit without regard for seniority reduce administrative spending 
and staff at the city board of education and create a board to 
oversee the changes 
many have mixed feelings about the degree of parental 
involvement called for in the package 
i dont feel that parents will have the time or the knowhow 
nor the interest to become that involved said francoise 
friedman who heads a proreform group called concerned parents 
network 
i am a very active parent and i know how difficult it is 
to get parents involved she said 
the school board and the chicago teachers union have declined to 
endorse or reject the proposal 
the entire bill is under review by the boards legal 
department said spokesman robert saigh 
john kotsakis assistant to jacqueline vaughn the union 
president declined comment we havent seen the final and actual 
language he said

the newest kennedy candidate is sen 
edward m kennedys youngest son patrick and hes going after a 
seat in the rhode island legislature although hes just a 
21yearold college student 
the 49yearold democrat whos held the job for 10 years resents 
it and some key state democrats say kennedy is just practicing 
before he runs for congress he has to be 25 before he can serve 
there however 
kennedy a junior at providence college a small private school 
in the states capital is challenging rep john m skeffington jr 
for a parttime twoyear legislative post 
im so surprised said skeffington adding that he was an 
acquaintance of the kennedy family i just didnt think they 
would come in and run against an incumbent 
i am not opposed to patrick kennedy said city councilwoman 
carolyn brassil the city democratic chairwoman i just feel that 
a student in rhode island shouldnt come into the state and run 
i get the impression that hes using this as a stepping stone 
to a congressional seat said brassil 
the democratic primary in september includes a third candidate 
city employee angelo a pitassi the winner will be unopposed in 
the november election because no republican filed for the seat 
skeffington had a difficult primary in 1986 and won renomination 
by only 185 votes against a 22yearold political newcomer the 
district has more than 4900 registered voters 
kennedy said the examples of his uncle president john f 
kennedy and his father who won his us senate seat from 
massachusetts in 1962 inspired him to get into politics 
ive been given a name and i think theres a certain 
responsibility that goes handinhand with that name he said 
it would be easier to sit back and enjoy all the things ive been 
given but im going to be spending my summer walking 
doortodoor 
skeffington questions the young candidates commitment to the 
neighborhood after he graduates in two years and calls attention 
to his familys wealth 
i know that pat has said on a radio talk show that he will 
spend as much as it takes he said i dont have those kind of 
funds im going to run on my record 
kennedy spent 12000 in the march primary to win election as a 
michael dukakis delegate to last weeks democratic national 
convention 
skeffington frequently uses the word they meaning the 
kennedy clan when referring to his opponent which kennedy 
dislikes 
people have said that the kennedys have come in to take 
over kennedy said thats no such thing patrick kennedy is 
running for state rep 
the newest kennedy candidate faces several obstacles his age 
his relatively short residency and his name he shares an apartment 
in a frame house in the mount pleasant district a few blocks from 
campus 
hes an outsider in the ethnic bluecollar neighborhood and a 
wealthy one at that despite his wealth kennedy says his 
neighbors showered him with cards and expressions of sympathy when 
he was hospitalized last spring to have a benign tumor removed from 
his back 
skeffington runs a funeral home that his grandfather opened 
after coming to america from ireland in 1907 
i am a mount pleasanter said skeffington who turns 50 on 
aug 11 the people of my district are people like me were 
workingclass people we politicians try to do a good job for our 
constituents and i feel i do a good job for them 
kennedy said he watched skeffington while working as a 
statehouse page and legislative researcher his first year at 
college 
i saw someone who has had a chance to do more for the 
community but hasnt done so kennedy said i dont think an 
incumbent has a divine right to the office he holds just because 
hes an incumbent 
patrick kennedy is the latest of a new generation of kennedys to 
take a shot at politics his brother teddy jr and sister kara 
are running their fathers reelection campaign in massachusetts 
his cousin joseph p kennedy ii son of the late robert f 
kennedy is a congressman from massachusetts kathleen kennedy 
townsend the oldest daughter of robert kennedy made an 
unsuccessful congressional bid in 1986

iraqi battlefield offensives during un 
ceasefire efforts are aimed at strengthening iraqs position in 
peace talks and achieving a permanent solution to complicated 
problems according to officials and diplomats here 
while iran announced last week that it would accept a un 
security council ceasefire resolution iraqis say they hope to 
forge a lasting peace with their longstanding rival to the east 
a ceasefire alone might pave the way for further talks iraqis 
and diplomats say but it would not solve major and often enduring 
disputes between the two sides 
these include irans support of kurdish rebels in northern iraq 
iraqs backing of iranian rebels along the border a disputed strip 
of land and arguments over borders and navigation in the shatt 
alarab iraqs main outlet to the sea that date back centuries 
for the international community the important thing is to 
cease hostilities a western diplomat said for this country 
the important thing is to find peace these are two completely 
different aspects 
he said it could take months if not years to achieve a final 
peace settlement 
we dont want a situation where we get into a worse war in a 
couple of years a senior iraqi official told reporters over the 
weekend 
the iraqi official who also demanded anonymity indicated his 
country would not rush into any settlement we have lived with it 
war for eight years if it takes eight more weeks no problem 
he said 
he said the need for serious peace talks was behind iraqs 
insistence on direct talks with iran iran has balked at the 
proposal 
on the heels of irans ceasefire decision iraq launched 
sizeable offensives that it said drove the last remaining iranian 
forces from its territory it pushed several miles into iran 
iraq announced that more than 8500 iranians were taken captive 
a military communique which iraq said was drafted by president 
saddam hussein said the attacks were aimed at paving the way for 
peace by reclaiming all iraqi territory and taking captives 
apparently to even the numbers that will have to be exchanged after 
the war 
communiques also said the attacks were aimed at smashing irans 
already reeling war machine despite iranian claims the iraqi 
invasion reached nearly 40 miles inside iran the iraqi troops 
appeared to have withdrawn to their own borders within hours after 
their forays into iranian territory 
after the war a rebuilt iran will pose a continuing challenge 
to iraq which has a third of its neighbors population 
the two countries clashed diplomatically and militarily during 
the rule of shah mohammad reza pahlavi which preceded irans 
islamic revolution 
under a 1975 pact iran agreed to stop financing kurdish rebels 
who posed a serious problem for the iraqi government and to 
guarantee free navigation along the shatt alarab which leads to 
iraqs main port of basra 
iraqs september 1980 invasion of iran followed iranian shelling 
of iraqi towns and a declaration to close the shatt 
iraq renounced the 1975 agreement claiming iran already had 
done so but iraqi officials continue to refer to the pact as a 
basis for their claims to a strip along the central border 
the iraqi official said ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis acceptance 
of a ceasefire has destroyed irans dream of spreading its version 
of islam throughout the region this is a watershed between two 
eras he said 
it means iran has accepted the notion of coexisting with a 
secular regime and accepted political boundaries he said 
by accepting that in a legal and political sense it will be 
the end of a model he said referring to irans hopes of 
exporting its revolution

the barns of vermont are part of 
its history say preservationists critical of companies that are 
dismantling the familiar structures moving them and reassembling 
the frames for upscale housing 
the barn movers say the barns are dilapidated victims of 
neglect and finding other uses is better than losing them 
completely 
even if it goes outofstate people will see what an old barn 
was said ken epworth a founder of barn people of woodstock 
which has been dismantling barns for more than a decade you 
cant see it if its disappeared 
but preservationists like eric gilbertson say every barn thats 
torn down makes it more difficult to identify vermonts 
agricultural heritage 
every state developed differently and you can read a state by 
looking at its old buildings said gilbertson director of the 
states division for historic preservation how do you recognize 
a place that was a farm if the barns are gone 
thomas vissor a professor with the university of vermonts 
historic preservation program said precivil war barns known as 
yankee barns face the greatest threat they are likely to be of 
soughtafter post and beam construction with handhewn beams and 
often 30 feet by 40 feet a good size for a house 
the yankee barns are characterized by a shallow pitch roof 
vertical planking on the outside a large hinged door on the long 
side and three bays inside 
if they were houses we would certainly recognize them as 
being historic vissor said 
epworth agreed that vermont is losing its barns but said 
dismantlers arent to blame more than any other factor its 
deterioration he said farmers arent using them 
epworth and his partner david hill began by taking down old 
houses for scrap then barns in the mid1970s as the old post and 
beam architecture became popular again they began using the frames 
for new buildings 
most of their barns come from near white river junction in 
vermont and new hampshire about a quarter of the barns remain in 
vermont with the rest going out of state 
people who buy the barns are looking for a piece of history and 
architectural relics that cant be found among the staples and 
plywood of the modern building industry said ken arthur a partner 
in vermont historic frames and barns which has dismantled six 
barns in the last year 
theres a gut love for the old buildings because they are not 
made any more said arthur its like being in church for some 
people its a feeling you just cant put you finger on it 
it may be the wide beams of a single tree rippled slightly by 
the ax blade raised to the roof without a crane and hitched to the 
rafters by tree nails or wooden pegs 
once you see one you fall in love arthur insisted 
in recent years epworth said the market for slate roofing has 
fueled the loss of barns because someone taking only the slate and 
burning or bulldozing the rest can work much faster than someone 
who plans to use the frame each piece of which must be marked for 
reassembly 
the buildings were taking down are all dilapidated he 
said we wont take down a perfectly good structure 
nationwide barns have been threatened by changing agricultural 
practices in response the national trust for historic 
preservation last year sponsored a contest on remodeling old barns 
for modern uses 
mary humstone director of the denverbased barn again program 
said the 500 entries showed many economically feasible ways for 
farmers to continue using their barns rather than replacing them

a partially deaf boy found 
wandering the streets more than eight months ago traveled 700 miles 
across mexico to escape a life of erratic meals and begging 
welfare officials say 
he was off looking for a life of his own said cecilia 
villarreal director of the casa hogar del nino a governmentrun 
home here where 9yearold jose de jesus garcia aguilera now lives 
jose one of five children of a povertystricken family ran 
away in october from his oneroom house in the gulf of mexico port 
of tampico 
his father lives in another city and doesnt support the family 
and investigations show the child often was sent out to beg for 
money authorities said 
jose was found nov 7 wandering the streets of ciudad juarez 
about 700 miles from tampico and was taken to a government welfare 
agency there 
we dont know how he got there but this child knows how to 
handle himself ms villarreal said last week 
officials in ciudad juarez and across the border in el paso 
texas spent eight months trying to learn joses identity 
jose who was called sabath until his mother identified him is 
unable to write and only mumbles a few words he communicates 
mostly through gestures or pictures 
but officials here say hes an intelligent child who only lacks 
proper schooling 
many of the pictures the boy drew in ciudad juarez depicted an 
airplane in flames leading authorities to speculate that he might 
have survived a plane crash 
specialists now say those pictures reveal a very active 
imagination fueled by television and the fact that his home in 
tampico is next to an airport 
authorities say jose left home because he knew the world had 
more to offer than a tiny house erratic meals and days spent 
begging on the street 
hes very savvy and hes quite courageous because he went out 
into the world knowing that it wasnt going to be easy said 
fernando mendez cantu a welfare official in tamaulipas the 
northeastern border state where both tampico and ciudad victoria 
are located 
joses mother micaela aguilera claimed him in late june and 
took him home but she works long hours in a bar and is unable to 
properly care for the child said ms villarreal 
joses oldest sister a 13yearold takes care of the youngest 
children most of the time 
jose now lives with 109 other children at casa hogar a 
childrens home here run by dif the spanish acronym for integrated 
family development 
the home one of four in the state and dozens throughout the 
country provides food clothing complimentary education and love 
to children who have been abandoned or whose family is unable to 
provide a decent upbringing 
the children in the home range in age from less than a year to 
15 about 40 percent of them have been abandoned said ms 
villarreal 
jose now lives in a huge clean dormitory with about two dozen 
other boys in his age group he is spending his summer taking 
classes in art swimming and dancing all of them provided by the 
government 
in the fall jose will attend school for the first time a 
special education program where hell learn to use sign language 
and perhaps to speak 
hes definitely an intelligent child what he cant say in 
words he makes up for with signals said psychologist gloria 
ferrel 
the other children dont seem to struggle to understand jose as 
he pokes and points and pantomimes to make himself understood 
although jose has been at the home just a couple of weeks he 
already has established himself as a leader 
when the boys get together to play soccer jose is the one who 
comes out of the dormitory carrying the ball 
when the children line up for lunch at the cafeteria jose shows 
a late arrival where he should stand 
yet authorities say theyre keeping a watchful eye on the exit 
they say jose is just the kind of boy to round up a few friends 
and take off 
hes used to taking care of himself so he has a few problems 
with rules said ms ferrel

gov bill clinton has decided to accept 
an invitation to appear on nbcs tonight show with johnny 
carson who has comically savaged the governors speech at the 
democratic national convention 
clinton agreed saturday to appear with carson on thursdays 
show said press secretary mike gauldin 
clintons speech nominating michael dukakis for president for 
which 15 minutes were allotted went more than double that time

former vice president walter mondale says he 
wishes people would believe him when he says he just wants to 
practice law and dabble in politics and international affairs but 
stay out of bigtime politics and government 
still mondale says public figures should never say never 
and thats what gets him into trouble 
i cant respond to these questions without appearing to be a 
candidate then it looks like im ducking mondale said in an 
interview with the star tribune some people just cant believe

a special congress of burmas ruling party 
is considering drastic economic changes and may sweep away the 
rigid policies of former leader ne win when it chooses his 
successor official sources said sunday 
the sources who refused to be identified further said the 
changes being contemplated by the burma socialist program party 
include lifting barriers to private foreign investment for the 
first time since ne win seized power in 1962 
the 77yearold ne win announced his resignation saturday as 
party chairman citing his age and indirect responsibility for 
bloody antigovernment rioting in march and june 
by party rules action must taken to replace ne win by monday 
the final day of the threeday congress which is being held behind 
closed doors 
five other top leaders including burmass president and vice 
president positions less powerful than the party chairmans 
offered their resignations saturday 
prime minister maung maung kha the most senior member of the 
partys 17member central executive committee who has not resigned 
was seen as a likely replacement for ne win 
like all members of the government and party maung maung kha 
has been overshadowed by ne win since assuming his post in 1977 
the 68yearold former army officer is generally not regarded as a 
forceful or imaginative leader 
at the congress opening session saturday ne win called for a 
popular referendum on oneparty rule in burma 
in an announcement believed connected to the referendum state 
radio said sunday an emergency parliament session would convene 
wednesday under burmese law only the parliament can carry out 
referendums 
the emergency parliament session also could deal with the 
appointment of new government leaders 
sources at the party congress said proposals being discussed by 
the more than 1000 delegates included an almost wholesale pullout 
of the government from economic sectors it once tried to manage 
with disastrous results these include agriculture fishing 
forestry mining heavy industry trade and transportation 
the sources said the proposals also include joint ventures 
between private domestic and private foreign investors which ne 
win steadfastly opposed 
if the proposals pass the state monopoly on both foreign and 
domestic trade would end and the vast and currently illegal 
crossborder trade with neighboring countries would be legalized 
news of both the possible economic changes and the resignation 
of ne win has spread quickly through this capital of 35 million 
but public expression of opinion was minimal 
they the government are responsible for our poverty said 
one pavement hawker sunday echoing a sentiment heard among 
smallscale dealers in city markets 
burma potentially one of the regions most prosperous nations 
due to an abundance of natural resources sank under ne wins 
leadership to one of the worlds 10 poorest nations it has an 
annual per capita income of less than 200 
since october studentled demonstrations have three times 
rocked rangoon and other burmese cities resulting in deaths mass 
arrests and the closure of universities 
the october demonstrations were sparked when the government 
withdrew several currency notes from circulation without 
compensation more than 100 persons died in rioting in march and 
june according to western diplomats

police on horseback have been forced to 
conduct daily canada geese roundups because of a multiplying gaggle 
that is stopping traffic munching parched lawns and er making 
people more careful where they step 
the droppings are awesome town administrator bill reid said 
sunday everywhere the geese go the droppings follow 
since canada geese are a protected species it is illegal to 
kill them residents shoo them off their lawns with brooms and honk 
their car horns to get them out of the streets 
they stop here in the course of their migration and people 
feed them so they stay instead of moving on said officer dan 
bates at first people liked it but now were getting a lot of 
complaints 
kathleen sullivan said stoneham a town of 23000 about 10 miles 
north of boston is known as a bedroom community but the geese are 
keeping residents awake at night with their honking 
the flock also has raised the bacteria count at spot pond 
reservoir which supplies drinking water for stoneham and 
neighboring towns 
thats the main problem said mrs sullivan a member of the 
board of selectmen the more they multiply the more excretions 
go in our water 
town officials say the goose population has grown from a handful 
when the birds arrived 10 years ago to about 650 birds and the 
flock is growing daily 
until recently residents said the geese usually stayed on a 
patch of grass just north of a reservoir but when hot weather 
parched grass in late june and early july the geese began 
searching for greener pastures 
they eat the grass in one place and when theres no more 
they move down the street a little further said bates 
as they forage the geese have been stopping traffic at the 
intersection of south street and route 28 one of the towns 
busiest arteries the problem became so acute last week that dana 
owen and other officers mounted horses around noon every day to 
herd the geese back across the street 
in one yard owen said it was just black with geese you 
couldnt see the lawn 
paula morrison who lives near the reservoir said she knows 
its illegal to kill the geese but she can still hope while 
sweeping them off her lawn last week she said i was hoping 
several of them would get hit by a car 
larry gillis a spokesman for the metropolitan district 
commission which controls the reservoir said the mdc plans to put 
up a snow fence to keep the birds off the street 
but the best longterm solution he said would be for residents 
and visitors simply to stop feeding the geese 
reid has other ideas 
i think they should save four or five of them and get rid of 
the rest ship them north he said adding i hear they make 
good eating

limbo for five days 
the letter actually a bulky package weighing about 50 pounds 
apparently went from san diego calif to sydney australia and 
then back to london before it landed here and was turned over to 
us navy officials 
in london an employee of dhl the express delivery service that 
handled the shipment said it was not taken off an airliner that 
landed at bahrain last wednesday and went on to sydney it was 
found there and returned to london

airliner was an iranian jet fighter coming in for attack 
san diego is the missile cruisers home port 
one navy source who asked not to be named said us officials 
were not overjoyed about the project even before the letter 
went astray because it drew new attention to the jetliner tragedy 
a team of six us experts is investigating the shooting down of 
the iran air a300 airbus 
the vincennes left the gulf four days ago after spending two 
weeks at anchor here while investigators took depositions and 
collected other data their report is due early next month

operating with the uss forrestals carrier battle group that 
supports navy operations in the persian gulf

the letter described as handwritten on a large poster board 
expresses strong support for capt will c rogers iii and the 
crew of the vincennes as you strive to do your duty to god and 
country in troubled waters far from home 
the signatures were on long rolls of paper attached to the 
letter the list was first reported to be about 570 feet long four 
feet longer than the cruiser itself but karl higgins an aide to 
lowrey was quoted on saturday as saying it was actually 1000 feet 
long 
the 49th us navy convoy of the year was en route down the 
gulf with the missile frigate nicholas escorting the usflagged

this city known for cigarchomping politicians 
and smokefilled rooms on sunday became the latest to try to clear 
the air banning smoking in a host of public places ranging from 
taxis to train terminals 
despite the threat of fines there were already indications of 
rebellion 
ill smoke in my own cab no matter what the law says said 
taxi driver dean davis 44 a threepack a day smoker 
i will never tell a passenger not to smoke said davis who 
had two packs of cigarettes sitting next to him on the front seat 
of his cab 
the ordinance passed may 25 by the city council is similar to 
regulations passed by several other cities including new york and 
los angeles 
it bans smoking entirely in enclosed public areas such as 
meeting rooms and taxicabs and requires restaurants with 40 seats 
or more to set aside smoking and nonsmoking areas 
it requires that at least half the areas of airport terminals 
train stations and bus depots be nonsmoking 
the law also addresses smoking in the work place employers must 
designate smoking and nosmoking areas if workers request them no 
smoking signs must be posted in all designated areas 
bars and private meetings are exempt from the ordinance which 
carries fines ranging from 25 to 100 
police will follow the rule of persuasion and warning to seek 
compliance said lt john culloton adding that investigating 
complaints of illegal smoking will not be a top priority 
with all the calls we get for rapes robberies and everything 
else that wont be often he said 
taxi driver suheil ajaj said he thinks the law stinks 
because it will reduce business 
i believe the customer is paying for the right to smoke he 
said im not a smoker but i think its their right to smoke in 
my cab 
i think its a pain for everybody said sam sianas owner of 
billy goats tavern a watering hole off michigan avenue 
sianas said the vast majority of his patrons smoke so even 
though he intends to designate 15 of his 90 seats as nonsmoking 
the overall impact will hardly be noticed because the smoke blows 
all around 
how can you stop them from smoking he asked you can put 
up a sign but im not going to grab a cigarette out of somebodys 
hand 
chicago mayor eugene sawyer favors the new law which was 
supported by 33 aldermen 
but alderman edward burke one of eight who opposed the measure 
said police would be better placed trying to chase criminals than 
smokers 
don rose a political analyst said chicagos ban wont 
necessarily change the image of the city of big shoulders 
the socalled smokefilled room is an image of something going 
on out of the sight of the public so the smoking ban would not 
affect it he said 
and with a rise in the number of nonsmokers the smokefilled 
room itself is not necessarily smokefilled rose said

ali akhbar velayati left for new york to meet with un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
velayati said he had sent perez de cuellar a letter saying iraqi 
military action threatened a ceasefire and calling for the united 
nations to take timely and preventive action tehran radio said 
the un chief has invited iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz to 
new york for peace talks 
interviewed sunday on abcs this week with david brinkley 
perez de cuellar said he hoped hostilities would cease when he 
began discussions with the two leaders 
until there is a ceasefire i cannot complain the 
secretarygeneral said the only thing which i have done is 
to make an appeal to both sides to exert restraint and i hope of 
course that when i start my discussion with the parties i 
think there will not be military activities in the area 
asked if upcoming iraniraq peace talks would be held 
facetoface perez de cuellar said my idea is to discuss 
separately with both sides of course i will be only too pleased 
if at some stage i could have the two sides together 
iraq wants to hold direct negotiations iran refused but later 
indicated it might agree to them at perez de cuellars request 
in the iraqi capital of baghdad the staterun daily aththawra 
said iraq has no greedy intentions on iranian territory and does 
not want to humiliate the iranian people 
the article quoted by the iraqi news agency said iraqs 
military actions following irans acceptance of the un ceasefire 
resolution last week were designed to recapture iraqi territory to 
take as many prisoners of war as possible 
iraqi president saddam hussein has said taking a large number of 
prisoners would help in peace negotiations 
iraq accepted the resolution which calls for return to previous 
borders and a prisoner exchange when it passed a year ago 
iraq claims it captured 8636 prisoners of war in its incursion 
friday and saturday 
according to international red cross figures iran has about 
50000 iraqi pows and iraq held 13000 iranian soldiers before the 
latest raid 
irna said the iranian cabinet met sunday and praised the iranian 
people for heeding the call to join soldiers at the battlefronts 
the cabinet announced that on august 2 a moslem holy day in 
iran mass rallies would be held by iranians to reaffirm their 
allegiance to imam ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
iraq said its aircraft flew 148 combat missions inside iran on 
sunday and that two planes crashed in iranian territory iran said 
the two jets were shot down 
the iraqi communique said helicopter gunships carried out 217 
combat sorties inflicting important losses on enemy men weaponry 
and equipment 
it said four iranian soldiers were killed in other minor action 
the iranian agency said the border town of karandegharb in the 
bakhtaran province was hit by cluster bombs and seven civilians

a ceasefire in the iraniraq war means the 
united states would reduce its naval forces in the persian gulf and 
halt the escort of tankers as soon as we judge it safe prudent 
to do so defense secretary frank carlucci said sunday 
carlucci said it is too early to specify a date for a halt in 
the 1yearold administration policy of protecting the reflagged 
kuwaiti tankers from iranian attacks 
its a little hard to make that kind of judgment at this 
point carlucci said on nbcs meet the press when asked about 
a date for ending the escorts 
we want to watch the negotiations wed probably want to take 
some reasonable interval to make certain that the ceasefire 
holds he said but theres no desire to keep 27 ships there 
any longer than possible 
carlucci noted that navy ships will remain in the gulf as they 
have for 40 years but said we would certainly draw down the 
number of us ships as soon as feasible until the reflagging 
policy began the navy had only five or six ships in the waterway 
iran last week agreed to accept the terms of united nations 
resolution 598 which proposes a ceasefire as the first major step 
toward a negotiated peace that raised hopes that the bloody 
8yearold conflict would soon end 
but as representatives of both countries prepare to meet this 
week at the united nations iraq has launched a series of attacks 
into iran 
carlucci and john whitehead the deputy secretary of state both 
said reagan administration policies deserve credit for influencing 
irans decision to accept the resolution 
the fact that we have been resolute that we have stood by our 
friends that we have stood by the principles of freedom of 
navigation and that he iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
has not been able to drive us from the gulf has had a significant 
impact on iranian thinking carlucci said 
furthermore our staunchness in this area has helped to 
isolate iran in the world community carlucci said we have 
been quite successful in preventing our countries from shipping 
arms to iran so gradually iran came to the realization that their 
policies were not succeeding that they were not going to drive us 
out of the area 
whitehead appearing on abcs this week with david brinkley 
said this is a time if not for bragging at least its a time i 
think for all of us to be proud that our policy has been a 
success 
certainly irans decision is not solely attributable to us 
policy he said but our firmness of our military presence in 
the gulf our indication that we planned to stay there as long as 
it was necessary and at the same time our diplomatic track 
principally at the united nations has finally achieved success 
both men also said an end to the war could eventually lead to 
improved usiran relations and the possible release of american 
hostages held in lebanon by iranianbacked groups 
carlucci said he didnt know about any specific message from 
iran seeking improved relations but added we have consistently 
said that were prepared to enter into a dialogue with iran all 
they have to do is designate somebody who is officially empowered 
to talk to us and wed be glad to talk with them about policy 
issues about terrorism about bringing peace to the region about 
whatever is appropriate 
if they want to talk about policy issues hostages terrorism 
wed be pleased to do that he said 
asked specifically about reports the us hostages might be 
released carlucci said were obviously not going to discuss any 
quid pro quo with iran but if the iranians want to talk to us 
about the hostage situation and how theyre going to go about 
influencing their release wed be delighted to talk to them about 
it 
nine americans are being held hostage in lebanon 
im not in the slightest suggesting that there would be any 
deal for the hostages that is contrary to our policy he said 
as president reagan boarded air force one to return to 
washington from california he was asked whether the united states 
was ready for talks about the hostages 
he appeared not to hear the question and did not respond 
later aboard the plane presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said the hostage situation is easy to solve 
all they have to do is release them he said 
they dont need negotiations to release the hostages we are 
willing to talk to anybody any place but we are not willing to 
negotiate we are not willing to pay ransom there is no need they 
took them they should release them as far as we are concerned 
nothing has changed in regard to the hostages said fitzwater

christian lacroix kicked off a week of haute 
couture shows for winter sunday with plenty of luxury and an 
aboutface in style abandoning the short pouf skirts that made him 
famous and presenting a variety of styles 
his show received politely enthusiastic response from the buyers 
and press but there was no screaming ovation as there was at last 
years 
some found the show rather confusing as if lacroix didnt 
always know what to do with all that lovely fabric in clothes 
aimed at opulence the effect was sometimes perfect sometimes 
awkward or heavylooking 
but most agreed these clothes look much more wearable than the 
past even though couture is only worn by a handful of women who 
pay astronomical prices well up in the thousands of dollars for a 
simple dress 
lacroix kept his sense of fun in bright miniskirts with full 
paisley overskirts worn with jeweled suede boots and an oversized 
hat 
his new suit looks varied one red model with a long jacket and 
short skirt was a dead ringer for the chanel style another is the 
shortlong effect with the billowing overskirt to offset a shorter 
skirt underneath 
the full pantskirts or flowing pajamas were sometimes given a 
buttonedup highwaisted sailor suit look dressed up with mink 
capes or fox jackets cowl hoods and draped fichu collars are still 
lacroix trademarks 
the great invention of the collection was a tuxedo it came out 
as a smashing dark crepe jumpsuit with big rhinestone buttons 
large white satin lapels and cuffs on the jacket 
the evening gowns were varied and elaborate with brown in 
brocades chiffons and velvet a big favorite but lacroix juggled 
his palette throughout the show alternating combinations of hot 
colors with softly graded combinations 
a midnight blue velvet sheath with its topping of a puffy bow 
and train of manyhued brown blue and grey tulle was a knockout 
following the lacroix show was the evening wear at hanae moris 
show 
each carefully made blackgraywhite model drifted out painted 
or decorated with seagulls and waves birds butterflies and trees 
dresses featured large leaf patterns and trim 
mrs mori showed a wearable collection of outfits that showed 
the knee emphasized intricate draping and detail and brought out 
some flyaway toppers shorter in the front

republican george bush trying to 
bolster his standing among women voters on sunday proposed a 
wideranging childcare proposal that could give lowincome 
families government checks of up to 1000 per child 
the proposed program would cost 22 billion a year and 
eventually apply to all families with children under age 4 in which 
at least one parent worked bush said 
families who didnt get a government check would get a tax 
credit under the plan bush outlined the national federation of 
business and profession womens clubs 
at first it would apply only to lowincome families and would 
be phased in over four years to include higherincome households 
initial reaction to bushs proposal was favorable but tempered 
with criticism of his overall record on womens issues 
this is one of his first concrete gestures toward women 
said federation president beth wray 
asked how she would rate the speech she replied as far as 
addressing our issues he escalated on any scale but as far as 
addressing the kinds of things wed like to see advanced he didnt 
come close to a 10 
after bushs speech many members of the audience chanted 
era a reference to the equal rights amendment which bush 
opposes 
the vice president said the tax credit which would be in 
addition to the existing child care tax credit and the federal 
deduction for dependents is designed to recognize the increased 
costs of families with children 
there would be no strings attached to the tax credit and it 
would apply equally to those who paid for outside child care and 
those who didnt 
as businesswomen i dont need to tell you that child care is 
a significant business expense bush told the audience made up 
of about 2500 professional women 
the certain gop presidential nominee who has proposed an 
overall freeze on federal spending at the rate of inflation did 
not specify how his wideranging proposals would be financed 
he was accompanied to the speech by former transportation 
secretary elizabeth dole a frequently mentioned vice presidential 
possibility 
mrs dole wife of former gop rival senate republican leader bob 
dole accompanied bush here aboard air force two and according to 
bush aides helped worked on the final draft of his speech 
bush spokeswoman sheila tate said that there was no discussion 
during the flight of the vice presidential selection process mrs 
dole spoke to the convention after bush 
bushs criticized a 25 billion daycare proposal now before 
congress and favored by democrat michael dukakis that would 
provide direct government assistance to daycare providers it 
would not be limited to lowincome families 
bushs childcare program included 
expansion of the existing childcare tax credit to cover more 
lowfamilies at a cost of 400 million a year 
creation of workplace childcare centers for all government 
employees modeled after a program begun by mrs dole at the 
transportation department and a federally underwritten liability 
insurance program for private centers costing 50 million a year 
more federal assistance to help states and local governments 
set up programs such as sick child care and beforeandafter school 
care at a cost of 250 million 
bushs proposals received polite but scattered applause from 
the bipartisan audience im not going to give you a political 
speech he declared 
however he told the audience that one of my attributes for 
president is i did what many of you did i started a business 
the expanded role for women in the work force is dramatic it 
is the single most important demographic change in the second half 
of the 20th century he said 
but still bush noted that women still earn only 70 cents for 
every dollar earned by men 
he said that while this was up from the 59 cents of just a few 
years ago there is only one amount that women should earn for 
every dollar earned by a man and that is one dollar 
members of the audience cheered this remark loudly and waved red 
purses a symbol of the disparity in pay between genders bush was 
presented with such a purse 
campaign aides depicted the speech as a major effort to 
underscore bushs commitment to issues affecting working women his 
campaign has been making a push to improve his standing among women 
voters shown by a series of polls to be a weak point for him 
republican analysts have said that part of the gender gap 
problem which also afflicted president reagan in both 1980 and 
1984 reflects voter registration breakdown a greater proportion 
of women are democrats than men 
however some womens groups have accused bush as well as the 
overall reagan administration of insensitivity to womens issues 
and other social concerns and an overemphasis on defense issues 
asked why bush did not mention the equal rights amendemnt in his 
talk aide deborah steelman said these are todays relevant 
issues 
but betty forbes presidentelect of the organization said 
he may be beyond it the era but we are not

like a repentant sinner mexicos governing 
party is finding it difficult to convince others it has seen the 
light 
even if national elections on july 6 when the institutional 
revolutionary party won by the slimmest margin in its 59 years of 
existence were as squeaky clean as the party claims many mexicans 
remain skeptical 
officials of the party that has dominated modern mexicos 
government now admit at least in private that misdeeds were not 
unknown in the past 
but look at what we did this time one said in frustration 
speaking on condition of anonymity if we wanted to act as we did 
in the past the opposition would not have obtained anything 
indeed whether forced by circumstance or out of genuine belief 
in reform the party known as pri conceded congressional defeats 
and grudgingly settled for a 503 percent majority for its winning 
presidential candidate carlos salinas de gortari 
however cuauhtemoc cardenas of the leftist national democratic 
front finished with 31 percent and manuel j clouthier of the 
conservative national action party gained 17 percent 
despite the oppositions best showing in decades both cardenas 
and clouthier have taken to the road calling on mexicans to 
challenge the tallies which they say are fraudulent 
the pri had never before fallen below the 70 percent level 
moreover what people here call the fullwagon policy 100 
percent of everything is not that distant a memory 
in what may have been the most difficult statement ever uttered 
by a pri official salinas said in proclaiming his victory the 
era of virtually only one party is ending and we are entering now 
a new political stage 
until now modern mexican history has made pri practically a 
synonym for government 
the pri was created in 1929 by government leaders as an 
instrument to retain power through the control of labor unions 
peasant organizations indebted to government financing agencies 
bureaucrats and teachers 
it used and still uses government resources as its own 
any political opposition was considered against the 191021 
revolution 
congress was a key part of the pris domain in a supposedly 
federal system the party leadership in mexico city assigned 
congressional seats governships municipalities and other 
government jobs to the countrys regions 
this time the pri will not have the two thirds needed in the 
chamber of deputies the lower house of congress to make 
constitutional amendments 
in a complicated system that offers 300 of 500 seats for direct 
election and reserves a significant portion of the rest for the 
opposition the pri will hold 260 and the combined opposition 240 
in a development that will have less impact but is perhaps more 
symbolic the pri gave up for the first time four of the 64 seats 
in the senate 
despite government claims ballotstuffing and takeall habits 
do of course die hard 
journalists witnessed ballot stuffing in the northern border 
state of chihuahua other allegations were widespread throughout 
the country 
a slow vote count lingered from the old system when people 
voted the government took the ballot boxes and two weeks later 
announced who won 
official results were not announced until july 13 a week after 
the election 
even for the nonpartisan suspicions were hard to avoid 
electoral officials privately said there were more voters this 
time than in previous elections yet their totals show that only 
half of 38 million registered voters went to the polls compared to 
75 percent in 1982 
even the most loyal party officials privately admit that past 
figures were inflated to enhance pris reputation or simply to 
spread the illusion of support for the system and cover up voter 
apathy 
despite widespread skepticism salinas and his reformminded 
associates had insisted during the campaign that they intended to 
modernize and democratize the pri and mexico 
keep in mind this is a new experience for us all one top 
government official said in an interview we will have to learn 
to live with it 
this is a mexican perestroika the official said speaking 
on condition of anonymity he was referring to soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs program of social and economic reforms

forty years after president harry truman 
ordered the integration of the armed forces black veterans of the 
korean war have won a battle for a fresh look at an army history 
they find disparaging 
the army has ordered a review of accounts of a black regiment 
that could lead to a change in the official history 
executive order 9981 issued by truman 40 years ago tuesday did 
not bring immediate integration to the military in which black 
units were largely segregated and commanded by whites 
but as a result of trumans order the military became one of 
the first major american institutions to desegregate and routinely 
place blacks in positions of authority over whites says edwin 
dorn of the joint center for political studies in washington 
the military grudgingly at first served as an engine of 
social change and racial justice dorn wrote in the may edition 
of the centers magazine 
the last major black unit the armys 94th engineer battalion 
was not broken up until 1954 
and when the korean war broke out two years after truman issued 
his order the 24th infantry regiment was still an allblack 
outfit commanded by white officers on occupation duty in japan 
the 24th was among the first units sent to korea and was 
bloodied in the battles which raged up and down the penninsula 
an official army history of the first months of the war written 
by roy appleman and issued in 1961 describes the performance of 
the 24th in highly uncomplimentary terms glossing over a battle at 
yechon an engagement that another book published last year calls 
the first major us victory in the war 
the armys treatment of the 24th regiment rankled korean war 
veteran david k carlisle a black graduate of west point who has 
campaigned for nine years for a revision of applemans work 
the official history carlisle said in an interview uses 
terms which are offensive the ulterior motive like all other 
references to black combat units is intended to denigrate the 
contributions that black fighting men have made for our country 
army secretary john o marsh jr this month ordered that the 
chief of military history brig gen william a stofft to review 
applemans work to address expressed concerns about the portrayal 
of the 24th infantry regiment 
an army spokesman maj greg rixon said it is not clear what 
will happen if applemans version is found to be flawed appleman 
said rixon is ill and not available to comment 
carlisle however is confident the official version will be 
revised which he says is extremely gratifying to me 
the official history calls the 24th an all negroregiment 
and repeatedly describes it in terms more negative than used for 
allwhite regiments under what were apparently similar 
circumstances 
the 24th wrote appleman was frightened and demoralized 
had a tendency to panic straggled in retreat and required 
two officers for every one in another unit one must command and 
the other must drive 
nearly all us units in the war retreated in disorder at 
various times especially after the peoples republic of china 
joined the fight but appleman time after time singled out the 24th 
for what he called a chaotic flight or a disgraceful 
episode 
the most glaring slight seems to have been in the official army 
description of the battle of yechon 
the first action for the 24th if indeed it was an action 
at all appears to have occured at yechon on 20 july appleman 
wrote 
an associated press dispatch on july 2021 by war correspondent 
tom lambert who was with the unit described yechon as the first 
sizable american ground victory in the korean war 
and an official army report at the time called yechon the 
first south korean city restored to friendly hands by american 
troops although it was not a tremendous victory many believed it 
symbolic of the liberation of south korea 
clay blair author of the 1987 history the forgotten war 
wrote that the victory was reason for blacks to celebrate 
but yechon was not long remembered moreover the army later 
attempted to obliterate it from the official record 
calisle was assigned to the 77th engineer combat company which 
served in close proximity to the 24th regiment along with an 
another black officer col charles m bussey who was decorated 
for his heroism at yechon 
bussey arrived on the scene and saw north korean units 
attempting to outflank the 24th carlisle said by telephone from 
his home in los angeles bussey commandeered a 50 calibre machine 
gun and killed 258 enemy almost singlehandedly 
bussey was awarded a silver star and a purple heart after the 
engagement and according to blair and carlisle was nominated for 
the medal of honor 
he might have become the first black officer to win the highest 
american combat award but somewhere up the line the medal was 
killed wrote blair 
carlisle has reactivated the nomination of bussey for the medal 
which he calls his next fight against army racism

three members of a jury that convicted a 
mexican migrant worker of murder have formed a support group for 
the man after voicing doubts about their decision 
i feel there is a really good chance he is innocent and we 
need to do something about it sherien jaeger said in an 
interview with the sunday oregonian 
jaeger voted to convict santiago ventura morales as a jury 
member in october 1986 ventura was sentenced to life in prison for 
the crime 
jaeger said she has been tormented by doubt ever since the trial 
she said another juror patricia lee called her three days 
after the trial and said she felt very uncomfortable 
she asked me how i felt jaeger said i just felt that i 
had made a mistake and i didnt know what to do about it 
now jaeger lee and a third juror david ralls visit ventura in 
prison send money and write letters to the state parole board 
pleading for his release 
transcripts from the trial show that only one witness an 
illegal immigrant from mexico testified that ventura was the 
killer the witness epifanio bautista lopez initially testified 
that he saw nothing but changed his testimony after a recess and 
he was taken into the district attorneys office 
under crossexamination bautista said he was afraid of what 
might happen to him if he did not testify the way the prosecutor 
wanted him to testify 
while jurors deliberated they initially were split over the 
question of venturas guilt jaeger was among those voting not 
guilty unable to reach a verdict the jury was excused for the 
night 
back in the jury room the next morning jaeger changed her vote 
to guilty leaving only lee and glorya oppitz on the innocent side 
and they eventually relented 
oppitz has refused to join the support group formed by jaeger 
lee and ralls but said she would like to erase the trial from her 
memory 
other jurors said they had no second thoughts 
i felt he was guilty because he never testified said alma 
dennis another juror 
several days after the trial lee oppitz ralls and jaeger 
visited defense cocounsel lane borg saying they had changed their 
minds and asking if they could do anything about it 
borg found that a verdict cannot be thrown out simply because 
jurors change their minds the support group has decided that if 
all other legal recourse fails they will ask gov neil goldschmidt 
to commute venturas sentence meanwhile an appeal is pending

the federal government is refusing to 
pay off the mortgage on a confiscated 11 million home arguing 
that republic national bank of miami should have known the house 
was bought with drug money 
at best for the bank republic stuck its head in the sand to 
avoid obtaining the knowledge of the drug connection assistant 
us attorney alan dagen charged in court papers 
republic seeks repayment on its loan to a panamanian company the 
government says was controlled by convicted smuggler indalecio 
iglesias 
if this is upheld it could force banks to run fbi checks on 
every borrower said stan beiley attorney for republic 
under federal laws the government may seize properties bought 
or built with drug profits or homes in which drug deals occurred 
the laws also provide that the government must honor mortgages or 
liens on seized properties if the mortgage holder is an innocent 
party 
after the government seized the palatial fivebedroom home in an 
exclusive coral cables neighborhood last month the bank asked that 
its oneyear 800000 mortgage be paid off when the house was sold 
but the government refused 
federal prosecutors contend in court documents that iglesias was 
laundering his illgotten gains when his thule holding corp 
pledged its sole asset the house as collateral for the mortgage 
in 1987 
of course we didnt know anything about it we had no idea 
republic president frederick de la mata told the miami herald 
sunday 
no charges are pending against iglesias although he was 
convicted of smuggling marijuana in 1981 
the government says republic should have guessed a drug 
connection existed 
despite suspicious circumstances republic looked the other 
way while accepting gratuities from iglesias the government says 
in court papers which allege the house was built using the 
millions of dollars iglesias earned smuggling drugs from 1980 to 
1985 
thule allegedly paid for airplane tickets and a hotel room for 
de la matas sons honeymoon only three days after the 800000 
mortgage was approved in a hastily called meeting of republics 
loan committee de la mata contends that ramon puentes an old 
customer with no connection to thule gave his son the trip 
the government also says the bank should have been suspicious in 
part because de la mata knew thule was trying to sell the house 
also granting the mortgage in just two weeks was unusual as was 
granting a loan when the house was vacant something banks rarely

mexicos attorney general angered 
by the slayings of a tv anchorwoman and two others in a hail of 
police bullets suspended the juarez head of the federal police and 
vowed to press an investigation 
one federal police officer and three city police officers were 
arrested in the machine gun attack saturday in downtown juarez 
my indignation is greatsaid attorney general sergio garcia 
ramirez who visited juarez late saturday and vowed the four 
officers would be brought to justice 
garcia pledged that the bad elements in the federal force 
will be removed there are good elements in the force ones who 
devote their lives to it that isnt the case in this instance 
we wont let this blow over 
the driver of the victims car the anchorwomans husband said 
he had refused to stop for men who identified themselves as police 
because he was afraid they were robbers he said he had 12000 in 
the car 
the four arrested officers told police they had mistaken the 
victims car for a similar car carrying suspected narcotics 
traffickers who engaged in a shootout with police earlier saturday 
the officers were accused of killing linda bejarano 28 
anchorwoman for station xhij in juarez her motherinlaw lucrecia 
martinez de gomez 58 and a family friend carlos alfonso garcia 
25 station officials said ms bejarano was three months pregnant 
she had two daughters 
ms bejaranos husband and coanchor manuel gomez martinez 
said he was driving the car but escaped injury by lying on the 
floor 
the attorney general suspended joaquin salvador galvan as head 
of the federal judicial police here 
garcia said the three city officers were madrinas 
underlings who work illegally for members of the elite federal 
force 
the practice illegal because the city officers are not sworn as 
federal agents gives the madrinas the thrill of working with a 
federal officer who benefits from their unpaid assistance 
authorities said evidence indicated the killings were the result 
of mistaken identity and not because gomez and ms bejarano were 
journalists 
in the last six years there have been more than 20 cases of 
unsolved murders of mexican journalists journalist groups allege 
that at least some of the reporters were killed in revenge for 
their work or to silence them 
in an emotional phone call to the attorney general gomez raised 
the possibility that he might have been targeted by drug 
traffickers for some of his work but neither anchor was known for 
exposing drug traffickers or government corruption 
corruption allegedly is rife in all levels of mexicos police 
forces and was a major issue in the recent national election won 
by the longdominant institutional revolutionary party despite a 
record vote for the opposition 
transit police in juarez routinely solicit bribes from americans 
in exchange for not writing traffic tickets immigration officials 
have been accused of setting up fake checkpoints to shake down 
tourists 
state and federal judicial police often are rumored to accept 
money from narcotics traffickers in exchange for protection 
gomez said the assailants shouted from their car that they were 
with the federal judicial police and ordered him to stop he said 
he didnt stop at first because he was afraid they would search his 
car and steal 12000 in cash he had collected for doing publicity 
work for a traveling circus 
he told police that he stopped when the men struck his car with 
theirs then the men got out with automatic weapons and without a 
word opened fire 
carlos armendariz the new head of the federal judicial police 
in juarez said the four officers had mistaken gomez car for one 
involved in a shootout with federal police about two hours earlier 
25 miles south of juarez 
federal police had an anonymous tip that the car was carrying 80 
kilograms or 176 pounds of cocaine armendariz said 
saturday afternoon police found an abandoned bulletriddled 
and bloodsplattered car matching the shootout cars description 
with 38 kilograms or 83 pounds of cocaine in the trunk state 
judicial police commander ramon olivas said

been scheduled for some time and he is hitching a ride back on air 
force one

nomination at the gop convention that opens in new orleans aug 15 
on board air force one en route to washington reporters asked 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater about bakers plans and 
were told he did not know that reagan and baker had only a very 
brief chat they chatted in the hallway 
hes still treasury secretary put it that way said 
fitzwater

talk to them about the question he replied with a note in a folder 
that contained a dollar bill baker wrote please note the title 
under the signature 
the title under bakers signature on currency is secretary of 
the treasury

to the president during the week on a trip of 10 droughtstricken 
states that he and other government officials have completed

september would speak at two republican fundraising events in los 
angeles while in california for another ranch vacation next month

for the new orleans convention on aug 14 
the president devoted his weekly radio address saturday to an 
attack on the democratic national convention in atlanta where he 
said speakers repeated the same sad song they sang four years 
ago 
he did not as he had in some speeches specifically attack 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis nor did he mention 
bush whom he has often lavishly praised

prosecutors have refused to grant 
immunity from perjury charges to a 14yearold girl who recanted 
sex abuse charges against her stepfather before he was sentenced to 
six years in prison 
the girl now says she lied two years ago when she initially told 
of the alleged abuse and lied again in april before the jury that 
convicted her stepfather because she was afraid of going to jail 
for perjury 
she is working with her mother to get her stepfather a new trial 
by raising money to hire a lawyer for an appeal the mother and 
daughter publicized their cause over the weekend by being 
interviewed by the orlando sentinel but the identities of the two 
adults and the girl were not revealed in keeping with state law 
prosecutors contend the mother indirectly pressured the girl 
into recanting 
assistant state attorney michelle heller said the reason for 
refusing to grant her immunity however is that to do so would 
condone lying the girl either lied when she made up the charges 
or would have been lying when she recanted the prosecutor said 
it undermines the whole system ms heller said why 
should we say its ok to lie its not our policy to grant immunity 
to people you think are telling lies under that immunity 
judge gary formet in what he called one of the toughest 
decisions he has made in nine years on the bench denied the 
34yearold mans motion for a new trial and he sentenced him to 
six years in prison on charges of lewd assault although he had 
been informed the girl had recanted 
the mother steadfastly denies pressuring her daughter to recant 
and the daughter said the only pressure came from prosecutors 
angered by her decision to recant 
the case began when the girl broke down in tears to her 
elementary school teacher in march 1986 right after a police 
officer had talked to her class about sexual abuse by parents and 
relatives 
now she says she made up the story because she wanted more time 
with her mother it seemed like my mom paid a lot more attention 
when he was gone the girl said 
the girl met privately with the prosecutor ms heller on june 
1 the day of the sentencing and told her she was lying 
i was looking right at her the girl said she said you 
couldnt have lied that long she said youre lying youre 
lying and hit the table she scared me 
ms heller disagreed with the girls version 
i never yelled at her heller said i was trying to get 
her to explain why she waited until the sentencing to tell me if i 
seemed angry it wasnt at her i was upset that this was 
happening

may soon be springing up around the world offspring of a giant 
500yearold pine tree named after the world war ii hero 
the us forest service and two men from louisville ky hope 
to use seeds from the cones to start new trees and plant them near 
the original in northern wisconsin and in places of historical 
importance to macarthur 
the macarthur pine was recognized as a champion white pine by 
the american foresty association in 1945 and reigned as the 
countrys champion white pine for years until a storm blew off 40 
feet from the 140foot tall tree 
foresters said they are uncertain how much longer the tree will 
continue to produce pine cones with the seeds for new trees last 
year the old pine only had a few cones said stan lemaster who 
with theodore klein has made a hobby of growing seedlings and 
cuttings from historic trees 
lemaster said last week that he wants to provide seedlings from 
the macarthur pine to places important to the world war ii general 
such as australia japan and the philipines as well the military 
academy at west point ny and little rock ark macarthurs 
birthplace 
i would just love to propagate it said lemaster who has 
planted 316 trees in 122 cities in the 50 states england canada

republican george bush wooed women voters sunday with an 
ambitious childcare proposal as yet another poll pointed up his 
need to close the gender gap and democrat michael dukakis with 
his running mate lloyd bentsen wrapped up their first campaign 
swing as political partners 
both presidential contenders faced some vocal opposition on the 
campaign trail 
bush won praise for a 22 billion childcare plan he unveiled 
before a group of professional women but when he finished 
speaking many in the audience broke into chants of era a 
reference to the equal rights amendment which the vice president 
opposes 
and dukakis who supports abortion rights was heckled by 
antiabortion protesters in st louis where he attended church 
services 
the democrats meanwhile were looking back with satisfaction on 
their national convention which ended last week while the 
republicans looked ahead to theirs three weeks away 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters aboard air 
force one en route to washington on sunday that president reagan 
may make a midwestern campaign trip on bushs behalf between now 
and the convention 
bushs campaign manager lee atwater promised at least one 
piece of gop convention drama pledging that the vice president 
would not unveil his choice of a running mate until next month in 
new orleans 
hes going to keep his own counsel on it and hes going to 
let us all know at the convention atwater said sunday in an 
interview on cbs face the nation 
i think that will be very exciting and very dramatic he 
said 
the republicans say their convention preparations are proceeding 
on schedule but local fundraisers in new orleans acknowledged 
they would have to work hard to hunt up the cash for facilities and 
services the city has promised to provide during the gathering 
ron jones heading up the convention citys fund drive said 
fund raising was running maybe a little behind but that the 
money should be on hand before the convention opens aug 15 
republicans and democrats were united in one respect the 
amount of time they were devoting to talk of party unity 
pat robertson bushs onetime rival for the gop nomination 
urged his supporters to rally behind the vice president the 
television evangelist also said his flock wasnt out to start any 
floor fights at the republican convention 
however robertson told a republican rally in charleston sc 
on saturday that he would like to see a plank calling for the 
nomination of conservative candidates at all levels of the federal 
judiciary 
the democrats meanwhile were giving themselves good reviews 
new york gov mario cuomo said democrats came out of their 
convention well positioned for a big win in the fall 
it will be one of the great defeats in modern history for the 
republicans cuomo said sunday on face the nation the 
governor who got more attention as a noncandidate than some of 
the democratic candidates did said he would campaign for dukakis 
wherever he wants me 
as for the candidates themselves bush was accompanied by former 
transportation secretary elizabeth dole as he addressed the 
national convention of business and professional womens clubs in 
albuquerque on sunday his childcare proposal was favorably 
received by the group 
the proposal initially affecting only lowincome families 
would eventually apply to all families with children under age 4 in 
which at least one parent worked he said 
this is one of his first concrete gestures toward women the 
groups president beth wray said afterward 
a number of surveys have suggested that dukakis is better 
regarded by female voters than is bush the latest poll by 
newsweek magazine said bush trailed dukakis by 17 points overall 
55 percent to 38 percent and that dukakis strength was due in 
part to the backing of 58 percent of the female voters 
the survey of 948 registered voters conducted july 2122 had a 
margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points 
dukakis attending sunday church services with bentsen in st 
louis faced antiabortion protesters outside the governor calls 
abortion a difficult very serious very important ethical and 
moral judgment that a woman must make for herself 
in st louis dukakis and bentsen were introduced by rep 
richard gephardt of missouri who had also sought the democratic 
nomination 
the democratic nominee and his running mate got off to a running 
start after the convention that anointed them they visited five 
states including the big battlegrounds of california and texas 
dukakis returned to boston on sunday night where he was 
welcomed by about 150 people at logan international airport 
bentsen meanwhile flew back to washington 
bush returned to washington on sunday night after a fiveday 
campaign swing that took him to eight states 
treasury secretary james baker who was in california for a 
weekend fundraising event accompanied reagan on his return flight 
from california on sunday but an administration official dismissed 
speculation that bakers presence signaled any immediate 
announcement of his resignation to run the bush campaign 
fitzwater the white house spokesman baker had a very brief 
chat with reagan and added hes still treasury secretary put 
it that way 
when reporters aboard the plane sent baker a note asking them to 
come back and talk to him about the matter he replied with a note 
with a folder that contained a dollar bill 
please note the title under the signature baker wrote that 
title of course is secretary of the treasury

in israelisoviet relations 
shamir heads the conservative likud bloc and peres the socialist 
labor party the fractious coalition has governed israel since 1984 
when neither party gained a majority in the election 
shamir and peres conducted separate briefings for the consular 
group that will leave tuesday for the netherlands the delegates

wiring insulation has been implicated 
in fires in at least 12 military and commercial aircraft models 
but the hazard may actually be much more widespread according to a 
published report 
the fort worth startelegram in stories published sunday and in 
an early monday edition said the air force was slow to notify its 
flight crews about dangers associated with the insulation called 
kapton under certain conditions 
kapton also was used on the space shuttle and may have caused a 
fire during maintenance in 1983 that wasnt blamed on insulation at 
the time the newspaper said 
the navy banned kapton in 1986 after documenting in laboratory 
tests that it can explode in flames and disable crucial 
flightcontrol systems the air force restricts kapton use only in 
highvibration areas of new aircraft and recently issued a ban on 
its use in repairs 
the air force contends that the conditions necessary for such an 
explosion to occur rarely exist except in laboratory tests and that 
it is impossible to determine whether the insulation was to blame 
for electrical fires in years gone by 
virtually all contractors who provide us military aircraft to 
the air force use kapton extensively the newspaper said no known 
deaths have been caused by insulationrelated aircraft fires 
through almost two decades of the insulations use in more than 50 
kinds of aircraft 
the newspaper reviewed 265 field reports dealing with electrical 
problems on the air force f16 and found at least 45 instances 
between 1978 and 1986 of wire fires or severe arcing included are 
six inflight emergencies and two incidents considered potentially 
lifethreatening by the air force and general dynamics maker of 
the f16 
the singleengine fighters which rely on electrical impulses to 
control their flight rather than mechanical wires and pulleys each 
contains 10 miles of kaptoncoated wire more than 85 percent of 
the aircrafts wiring 
navy laboratory studies in 1984 and 1985 found that kapton a 
carbonbased film can explode under certain conditions when 
exposed to an electrical arc 
the heat of the arc causes the insulation to carbonize 
instantly deteriorate into a charry substance and form a 
conductive path for the arc to spread to adjacent wires in an 
instantaneous explosion known as flashover or arc tracking 
fred rall jr the air forces top civilian engineer said 
flashover can only be documented by trained experts 
rall warned personnel about kaptan in a newsletter dated march 
26 1986 but concluded that it was an acceptable aircraft wire 
insulation given proper installation and maintenance procedures 
richard hill a researcher at the federal aviation 
administrations technical center in atlantic city nj said the 
agency is considering issuing guidelines on kapton usage in 
commercial aircraft such as recommending against its use in areas 
that are susceptible to moisture 
we do not believe theres enough information that says you 
should ban kapton and take it out of the airplane he said we 
do think there is enough of a problem or a potential problem that 
we should make some changes 
kapton began to gain popularity in the early and mid1970s 
first in the military and later in commercial aviation 
proponents said kapton was the perfect insulator being small 
enough to fit into tight spaces on fighter jets light enough to 
save precious fuel on airliners and strong enough as required by 
government specifications to last for the life of the aircraft 
but as the insulation was put into service maintenance crews 
initially complained that kapton was stiff brittle and fragile and 
broke easily when bent they argued that it was difficult to work 
with and required too much mothering to be practical 
jim harris a spokesman for ei du pont de nemours amp co which 
makes kapton contends that any insulation will arctrack in the 
presence of conductive fluid 
lubert leger head of the materials branch for nasas johnson 
space center in houston said a 1983 arcing incident aboard the 
shuttle columbia during maintenance may have been initially 
misdiagnosed 
contractor rockwell internationals investigation of the 
incident listed the cause of the fire as not apparent but 
leger told the startelegram said it had all the earmarks of a 
kaptonrelated flashover 
at least 100 aircraft electrical fires reported over the past 15 
years have occurred under circumstances that bear striking 
similarities to kapton failures aircraft maintenance records and 
navy field studies suggest 
records cite initial damage to one or two wires followed by 
arcing that spreads the fire to adjacent wires

homosexual teachers should declare their sexual 
preference openly and confront those who would drive them from the 
public schools speakers said sunday at a conference of gay 
instructors 
the time is right for us to assert ourselves in the 
educational field said virginia uribe a los angeles high school 
teacher we have so much power if we come out and we have so 
little power if were not out 
that message coming near the conclusion of uribes keynote 
address drew tumultuous applause from about 75 elementary high 
school and college educators at the daylong conference held in 
conjunction with a weeklong lesbian and gay health conference and 
aids forum 
other speakers echoed the message of openness but afterward 
when the group divided into small workshops boldness gave way to 
caution 
to some of us this is not real said a teacher from a 
kansas elementary school district who didnt want her name 
published id love to tell my kids that im a lesbian but if i 
did i wouldnt be there monday 
when a young teacher from ohio asked for advice on whether he 
should declare his homosexuality right away or wait until he had 
obtained tenure the answer came in a chorus get tenure 
warren blumenfeld a teacher in the watertown mass schools 
said he became a better teacher after he disclosed his sexual 
orientation 
when i first got out of ed school i thought i wouldnt say 
anything to my students about it he recalled but that drained 
me of my energy when i came out it freed me up to be who i was and 
to channel my energy into constructive channels 
however blumenfeld also cited a 1982 gallup poll indicating 
that 59 percent of americans felt homosexual educators should be 
excluded from public schools 
the educators were united in asserting that they pose no danger 
to students and in fact can serve as positive role models 
homosexuality is not contagious said blumenfeld having 
an openly gay or lesbian teacher will not make students who are 
confused become gay or lesbian 
but what it will do is it will show them that the option is 
ok and if they happen to be gay it will reduce their isolation

archbishop john oconnor of new 
york carried his plea for peace sunday to the hub of irelands 
sectarian violence in northern ireland where he said unemployment 
will breed more terrorism 
the cardinal flew to belfast from knock site of the irish 
republics most important roman catholic shrine at knock he prayed 
for peace and met relatives of two men imprisoned in connection 
with irish republican army bombings 
shortly after arriving in northern ireland oconnor went to 
impoverished west belfast stopping amid the garbage and rubble of 
the divis flats housing project where unemployment is 86 percent 
he called it a catholic ghetto 
this grinds into my soul to see this kind of hopelessness that 
comes from unemployment basically these kids are growing up with 
nothing he said 
nobody offers them anything and then the ira comes along and 
offers them status offers them recognition 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to unite northern ireland a 
british province were protestants outnumber catholics 32 with the 
predominantly catholic irish republic 
speaking of unemployment oconner said if it doesnt end it 
is just a festering festering wound and that is what ultimately 
creates violence 
the cardinal met several belfast teenagers including 
19yearold paddy mcerlean the youths 20yearold brother 
thomas was one of three people killed by a protestant gunman in 
the march 16 milltown cemetery massacre that prompted oconnors 
visit 
paddy mcerlean was asked what could bring peace to the area and 
he replied get the british army out and see what happens also 
jobs 
earlier in the day before he said mass at the shrine of our 
lady of knock oconnor met with the wife and mother of two men 
imprisoned after they were convicted of being involved in an ira 
campaign to bomb taverns in england in the mid1970s 
the women said they told oconnor their relatives were innocent 
and convicted unfairly 
we feel cardinal oconnor may well be able to raise this with 
president reagan or whoever succeeds him said nuala kelly a 
spokeswoman for the women and coordinator of the irish bishops 
commission for prisoners overseas 
kate mcilkenny whose husband richard was convicted in two 1974 
bombings in birmingham that killed 21 people said of the cardinal 
hes going to have a chat with some people when he gets back 
home 
during the mass oconnor spoke of the meetings in his sermon 
he made no mention of the merit of the cases but said he had the 
great privilege of speaking with lilly hill whose son paul has 
served 14 years of a life sentence for 1974 bombings in guildford 
oconnor arrived friday for his irish tour and is to leave

increased gasoline demand for summer travel 
pushed up prices an average of 2 cents a gallon during the past two 
weeks an analyst said sunday 
while demand was the major factor retailers also had been 
absorbing wholesale increases for about a month said trilby 
lundberg who oversees the twice monthly lundberg survey 
the average price including taxes for all grades of self and 
fullserve gasoline at the 12000 outlets surveyed nationwide was 
10168 at the end of last week ms lundberg said 
she predicted motorists may face further increases because 
during the latest survey period july 8 to july 22 wholesale 
prices again increased more than retail prices 
the survey found that the average price of gasoline at 
selfservice stations which account for eight of every 10 gallons 
of gasoline sold was 9279 cents a gallon for regular unleaded 
1077 for premium unleaded and 8941 cents a gallon for regular 
leaded 
at fullserve pumps the average price was 12078 a gallon for 
regular unleaded 13057 for premium unleaded and 11647 for 
regular unleaded

leaders of the warring factions in 
cambodia opened informal talks monday at the presidential palace in 
bogor and indonesian officials called it a coffee morning 
no name plates or other identification labels were on the 
circular table where delegates from cambodia and an alliance of 
cambodian resistance groups began negotiations in bogor 40 miles 
south of jakarta to end the bloody conflict 
one of the rebel leaders on sunday urged the other delegates to 
put aside politics and then he knelt in prayer before three 
buddhist monks 
i believe strongly in this meeting as the best chance for a 
solution to the cambodian problem son sann a former cambodian 
premier told reporters at the airport following his arrival 
the peace talks hosted by indonesia mark the first time the 
rebels have sat down facetoface with government leaders since 
vietnam invaded cambodia nearly 10 years ago 
son sann said the talks represented a chance for the parties 
involved not to think about political things but only one thing 
to put an end to the suffering of the cambodian people if everyone 
thinks about that then we will have good results 
since 1970 cambodia has suffered a devastating fiveyear civil 
war a reign of terror by the chinesebacked communist khmer rouge 
from 1975 to 1978 a 1978 vietnamese invasion and a continuing 
guerrilla war against the vietnamesebacked government millions of 
people have been killed in the nations turmoil 
the heads of cambodias three rebel factions arrived sunday in 
indonesia 
if the talks make progress officials from vietnam laos and 
the association of southeast asian nations were to join in 
wednesday 
the informal phased nature of the talks has been labeled 
cocktail party diplomacy 
indonesias foreign minister ali alatas greeted the heads of 
the three guerrilla groups on sunday they were son sann head of 
the khmer peoples national liberation front khieu samphan of the 
khmer rouge and prince norodom ranariddh he was representing his 
father prince norodom sihanouk who quit the resistance leadership 
but remains perhaps the most popular figure in cambodia 
their adversaries vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach 
and the prime minister of cambodias government hun sen arrived 
in jakarta saturday 
vietnam has announced it will withdraw 50000 troops or about 
half its force in cambodia this year and the rest by early 1990 
son sann said sunday that he had asked alatas and malaysias 
prime minister mahathir mohammed to ask people to pray for 
success of the talks in all mosques in their moslem nations he 
said he had also asked pope john paul ii to encourage prayers in 
roman catholic churches worldwide 
he then knelt on the floor of the airports vip lounge closed 
his eyes and folded his hands to his forehead in prayer before 
three buddhist monks who chanted blessings the monks came from 
the united states canada and france to bless participants in the 
talks 
though son sann and sihanouk are allied with the communist khmer 
rouge in a resistance coalition they strongly distrust the group 
because it killed hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled 
cambodia from 1975 until vietnam invaded 
sihanouk resigned as president of the coalition earlier this 
month because he said khmer rouge forces were killing his men 
the prince who ruled cambodia for three decades arrived 
saturday in jakarta as a guest of indonesian president suharto but 
he said he would not attend the talks personally 
in a recent interview with indonesian media alatas said all 
factions agreed that sihanouk would lead a future cambodia

polaroid corp which first gave the 
world instant snapshots more than half a century ago has been 
thrust into the public eye in 1988 by a series of highstakes 
events that portend significant changes for the company 
on wall street analysts and arbitragers are fascinated by the 
possibility of an allout takeover battle for polaroid prompted by 
a hostile bid last week from a californiabased investment group 
led by an heir to the disney entertainment empire 
in the courts the outcome of a 57 billion patent infringement 
suit against rival eastman kodak co could have a major impact on 
polaroid stock prices 
and in its headquarters along the charles river company 
officials are trimming the work force while preparing to challenge 
kodak and other film manufacturers with the worldwide introduction 
of conventional color film 
polaroid with a reputation for extravagant research and 
uninspired marketing now faces quick and important decisions 
were all waiting to see what happens said eugene glazer 
an analyst at dean witter reynolds inc in new york polaroid is 
hot right now 
polaroids tumultuous year began dramatically in late february 
with its 57 billion damage claim in the us district court 
patent suit 
polaroid claims it lost 32 billion in sales and 25 billion 
in business opportunities after kodak entered the instant camera 
field in 1976 
us district court judge rya zobel ruled in 1985 that kodak 
violated seven polaroid patents and ordered the rochester 
nybased company to halt production of the instant film and 
camera zobel last month withdrew from the 12yearold case due to 
family holdings of kodak stock the damages portion of the case is 
scheduled to be heard in january with a new judge presiding 
although kodak termed the damage claim ludicrous and 
ridiculously inflated polaroid stock has risen sharply from the 
mid20 range in anticipation of a decision in polaroids favor 
polaroid closed at 4075 a share friday on the new york stock 
exchange largely because of takeover talk 
the company would welcome any award even the 1 billion to 2 
billion many analysts predict following several years of 
lackluster performance polaroid camera sales have dropped nearly 
50 percent from a high of 75 million in 1978 and the public has 
poorly received several new products such as video film 
polaroid was formed in 1937 by dr edwin land jr to develop and 
manufacture a synthetic light polarizing material he developed 
polaroid produced instant color photography in 1963 and made its 
most stunning achievement in 1972 with the release of the sx70 
system which produced instant pictures outside the camera 
it has made ventures in other market areas but with nowhere near 
the success of its breakthroughs in instant photography 
amid takeover rumors the company on july 12 announced a 
reorganization plan highlighted by 500 to 800 layoffs and its entry 
into the 7 billionayear conventional film market 
company officials would not announce when the new film will be 
available outside spain and portugal where it has been sold for 
two years in direct competition with industry leaders kodak 
agfagevaert and fuji photo film co ltd 
meanwhile the layoffs mark the latest in a decadelong 
reduction in polaroids work force which has declined from more 
than 20000 in 1978 to nearly 13000 a company statement said most 
employees could select either early retirement or a severance plan 
that provided up to one years salary 
in addition the company issued 10 million new shares into an 
employee stock ownership plan and launched a 300 million company 
stock repurchase effort the move was interpreted as an effort to 
discourage takeover attempts 
but less than a week later shamrock holdings inc a television 
and radio concern based in burbank calif made a 40pershare 
bid for polaroid and filed suit in delaware seeking to cancel the 
employee stock purchase plan 
shamrock owned by the family of roy e disney a walt disney 
co director and nephew of the famous animator disclosed on july 
20 it had acquired 493 million polaroid shares as of may 11 
its takeover bid values the company at about 288 billion if 
all 719 million shares remain outstanding however shamrock has 
indicated it might not proceed unless it manages to get the recent 
10 millionshare issue rolled back in that case the implied value 
of the bid would be 248 billion 
because shamrock already owns a large block its cost to buy the 
rest would be 228 billion assuming defeat of the share issue or 
268 billion if the share issue is not defeated 
according to shamrock documents polaroid president and chief 
executive officer i macallister booth refused to meet with disney 
earlier this year to discuss company strategies booth eventually 
consented to a july 13 meeting on condition that shamrock would not 
acquire additional polaroid stock and polaroid in turn take no 
action which might hurt shamrocks investment 
the meeting was not held in the wake of polaroids 
reorganization announcement which shamrock termed a clear 
breach of its agreement with polaroid the company said it would 
convene directors tuesday to discuss the shamrock bid 
some analysts are skeptical the 10yearold shamrock group could 
put together a deal of such magnitude 
earlier this year shamrock failed in a 92 million bid for 
wherehouse entertainment a california video rental and music 
company shamrock owns music plus a 54store music and video 
retail chain in the los angeles area in addition to three 
television stations and 14 radio stations 
as far as im concerned its a very shaky bid said glazer 
there seems to be too many conditions attatched to the offer 
it just seems out of their league 
william relyea an analyst at dean witter reynolds inc in new 
york said shamrock could have a major impact on investors if it 
could arrange a tender offer at a lower price with a promise to 
distribute any dividends to shareholders following resolution of 
the kodak suit 
say for example they got polaroid for 30 a share said 
relyea well that would set the damage award at about 10 a 
share when right now no one can really say what effect it will 
have 
the offer by shamrock also could lure other suitors hostile or 
friendly into the bidding for polaroid analysts say

control data corp faced with 
slowerthanexpected us sales of mainframe computers plans to 
shut down several plants temporarily and idle 7 percent of its work 
force the last week in august 
the move will affect about 2000 workers in st louis park 
plymouth and arden hills and about 500 employees in sunnyvale 
calif and kansas city mo said tom charland a spokesman for 
the computer products division which makes mainframe computers 
employees will have a choice of taking accrued paid vacation 
during that week or going without pay charland said friday other 
divisions will not be affected by the shutdown he said 
the move will help consolidate vacation expenses in the third 
quarter which will improve cash flow in the fourth quarter when 
we want to do well charland said its hard to say what that 
means because so much of our business is concentrated at the end 
of the year 
control data has closed some of its operations temporarily 
before but this is the first time it has done so this year 
charland said the most recent shutdown occurred last year in the 
government systems group which makes military computers he said

the hunt brothers texas oil operation has offered 
to pay 8035 million to settle the final step in a bitter twoyear 
court battle between hunt companies and banks that lent them 15 
billion according to company officials 
the offer by placid oil co which is owned by hunt trust 
estates includes cash repayments of 6635 million over the next 
two months the hunts also would to pay the banks 140 million from 
placid production revenues during the next seven years company 
officials said saturday 
the plan which is subject to approval by federal bankruptcy 
court internal revenue service and major creditor groups nearly 
would complete the settlement of the case and would remove placid 
from bankruptcy protection 
it also would leave the billionaire hunt brothers with only 
pieces of the vast petroleumbased empire amassed by their father 
dallas wildcatter hl hunt 
late in june the hunt trusts and bank creditors agreed on a 
settlement to resolve issues surrounding some 760 million in loans 
to their penrod drilling co 
penrod the worlds biggest independent offshore oildrilling 
company and placid oil sued 23 of their lenders for fraud and 
misrepresentation in 1986 after defaulting on 15 billion in bank 
loans two of the banks since have been dropped from the case 
the suit sought 14 million in damages alleging the banks 
conspired to drive penrod and placid out of business by forcing 
them to agree to an unreasonable payment schedule while offering 
their competitors more favorable terms 
in august 1986 the trust estates of william herbert hunt 
nelson bunker hunt and lamar hunt filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection for the trust partnership that owns penrod drilling 
the reorganization plan proposed for placid calls for sale of 
the hunt brothers interests in the 60story thanksgiving tower a 
downtown dallas office building and disposal of hunt production 
properties in louisiana transactions that are completed or pending 
it depends on a number of large transactions hunt attorney 
henry simon said of the proposal 
simon said one obstacle to conclusion of the settlement was the 
negotiation under way in the netherlands for a loan of about 245 
million to be secured by placid international oil the hunts 
north sea unit 
the hunts already have paid 2135 million of the proposed 
6635 million cash settlement from funds raised through placid 
operations primarily the north sea unit as part of cash 
collateral agreements with bank lenders said simon 
another 150 million was raised through sale of the hunts black 
lake oil and gas fields in louisiana he said 
the brothers also plan to apply to the settlement their share of 
the 50 million in proceeds expected from pending sale of an 80 
percent interest in thanksgiving tower the planned sale of the 
building to bear stearns amp co a new york investment banking 
firm should be complete by midaugust said simon 
he said completion of the loan agreement associated with the 
north sea assets could come by early september but was dependent on 
negotiations under way with mortgage lenders who must approve the 
transaction 
the plan would leave the hunts with placids successful north 
sea operations and prospects in the green canyon sector of the gulf 
of mexico 
under the proposal to resolve the penrod loans bank creditors 
would receive a 50 million payment and a 500 million secured note 
from penrod drilling plus a 50 percent interest in the company if 
the hunts fail to meet certain debt repayment deadlines 
some trust real estate will be transferred to the banks subject 
to a 200 million purchase option 
the penrod plan also must be approved by federal bankruptcy 
court
